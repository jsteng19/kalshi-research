I wish you good health, fellow Ukrainians! Right now, I am at our magnificent Saint Sophia's Cathedral. And it is here that our new yet already established tradition has taken root – receiving letters of credence. Ambassadors who come to Ukraine, who begin their path here – they officially start it right here. And that’s how it has been since 2022. It’s a special rule, so that everyone who works with Ukraine sees and knows what kind of country we are, what history we have, how much depends on Ukraine, and what that means. And that Russia can never steal it. Today, I accepted the letters of credence from the Ambassadors of Germany, Norway, and the Czech Republic. They are our strong partners. We spoke. I thanked them for their clear support of Ukraine, of our independence, of our sovereignty. Europe’s positions are growing stronger, and each year we enhance Europe’s capabilities. All of us, contributing together. Due to our unity, due to our joint projects. I thank every partner. This week has brought us closer to finalizing the 19th sanctions package against Russian aggression; we expect its approval soon. We will quickly synchronize the package in Ukraine. Russia’s energy resources are being restricted. As well as the infrastructure of the shadow fleet – it will face new pressure. Cryptocurrency schemes used by Russia specifically to bypass sanctions will also be countered by Europe. Thank you. I am grateful that many of Ukraine’s proposals have been taken into account in the EU sanctions package. We are constantly working on this with every one of our partners, and of course, above all with the European Union and the Group of Seven. We now expect strong sanction steps from the United States as well – Europe is doing its part. Today, I also signed decrees imposing new Ukrainian sanctions. Three packages were signed. In particular, against propagandists helping Russia; against individuals doing business in occupied territories and feeding Russia’s budget, sustaining this system of evil; and against those destabilizing Moldova in Moscow’s interest. Ukraine is helping Moldova, and we are invested in the stability of our neighbor – in Moldova’s success. A few more things. Today, the Office of the President sent to the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine a law with my signature on the Cross of Military Merit – on the strong status of this award, our combat award. This also means state guarantees and respect for our fallen warriors. Since this award was founded, 331 Ukrainian warriors have been recognized with the Cross of Military Merit. Strong warriors. Thank you. I want to thank today our defenders of the sky. There was another massive Russian strike: nearly 580 drones, mostly “shaheds,” and 40 missiles. Many were shot down. Drone interceptors performed well today, as did mobile fire groups, aviation – our F-16s and our army aviation. I thank you all. All of you did great. Thank you for every downed target. But there were still hits. Dnipro, Pavlohrad and other communities in the Dnipro region were among Russia’s targets. We still need to strengthen our air defense system, and this depends heavily on partners. And many of them have this power – the power that must protect lives. It should be used. Everyone can now see Russian interference against Poland, and yesterday against Estonia. And these are not accidental incidents. The Russians will continue trying to spread their aggression, their destabilization, and their interference. That is their system. This must be countered, also systemically, and together. I thank everyone who is helping. I thank everyone who stands with Ukraine. And we are already preparing for important meetings next week – including with the President of the United States. Russia must feel the consequences of its actions. Glory to Ukraine!
