Dear Ukrainians! Today, first and foremost, I want to thank all the defenders of our skies. Every unit, every warrior who is protecting Ukraine from Russian missiles and drones. Today, we faced another strike on our energy sector – nearly 20 Russian missiles, including ballistic ones, and almost 125 drones of various types. A substantial amount of them was shot down. I will particularly commend the mobile fire groups of the 302nd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade of Kharkiv – great work, warriors! Thank you! I am also grateful to all our helicopter pilots in the Defense Forces, who, virtually every night, under extremely difficult conditions, deliver results in intercepting “Shahed” drones. These are helicopter pilots from our Land Forces, Air Force, Navy, and Border Guard Service – everyone in our Ukrainian Defense and Security Forces who is involved in protecting our skies, as well as those who contribute and offer support – thank you all! This week, and next week, we will continue discussions with our partners on ways to enhance the capabilities of our air defense – the protection of all our skies. Every available opportunity in the world, every potential contract that can strengthen Ukraine – we are focusing on all of these and working as quickly as possible. It is also important to mention Ukraine's energy security today – an important day, as the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine has made a significant step. Ukraine will be able to complete two more power units at the Khmelnytskyi Nuclear Power Plant, which means more than two gigawatts of electricity for Ukraine. And to put it into context, currently, during these difficult winter months, we can import roughly that amount of electricity from our neighbors. Our completed power units will allow Ukraine to operate without imports, even during the winter months. And it will definitely help us keep electricity prices from rising for the people. And even in terms of special economic projects with our partners – with the United States, with President Trump – regarding Ukraine's special resources, extraction and processing, Ukraine will now be able to speak more confidently, as it will have an additional and significant source of electricity in the future. In the modern world, industrial growth and development of any economy must be based on the development of energy sources. This is exactly what we are doing. Of course, there are some voices of criticism. But these are the voices of those for whom cheap energy in Ukraine is simply not profitable- they fill their pockets or the pockets of those they depend on from higher energy prices than nuclear power. All these numbers are available. Anyone can see and verify for themselves. I am grateful to our deputies who have supported Ukraine's energy independence and industrial development. We are already prepared for meetings with representatives of the United States – negotiations will begin soon. At many levels. I have scheduled a meeting of the National Security and Defense Council for tomorrow. On several issues. We will work on making medicines cheaper in Ukrainian pharmacies – this is important. And we will continue defending our state through sanctions. I am grateful to everyone who stands with Ukraine. Glory to Ukraine!
