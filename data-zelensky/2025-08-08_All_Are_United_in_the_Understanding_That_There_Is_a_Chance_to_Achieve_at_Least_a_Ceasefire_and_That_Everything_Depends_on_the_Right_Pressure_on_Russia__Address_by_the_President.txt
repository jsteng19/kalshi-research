Fellow Ukrainians! We are continuing our active negotiations with partners to reach a common position for a reliable peace for Ukraine. A truly genuine peace. And if everyone perceives the opportunities and threats in the same way, then it will be possible to achieve a truly lasting peace. There is already a lot of support, and it comes in the new circumstances, with a deadline now set for Russia to cease fire. So far, we see that the Russians are ignoring it – at least for now. Today has once again brought killings and Russian shelling. Over a hundred strike drones were launched overnight against us, against Ukraine, followed during the day by air bomb strikes, intense assaults on the frontline, and yet more air raid alerts in our cities and communities. I will cite just one of Russia’s war crimes committed today. In Kherson, a 13-year-old boy was deliberately wounded by a munition dropped from a Russian drone. He is receiving medical care. That is, Russia’s hunt for civilians in Kherson continues, and this is a deliberate destruction of life. No orders to stop have been given to the Russian army. We are speaking with our partners to ensure real steps are taken. More than a dozen conversations have been held with leaders and heads of government. Today – the Prime Minister of Poland, the President of Finland, the President of Latvia, the Prime Minister of the Czech Republic. Just now I spoke with the President of South Africa. The coming days will also be devoted to diplomacy. Security advisors spoke yesterday, and today their work continues. Andriy Yermak is coordinating the leaders’ advisors. The Minister of Foreign Affairs is working with his counterparts in Europe. We are in constant communication with the American side, and our partners, for their part, are also engaging with the United States. All are united in the understanding that there is a chance to achieve at least a ceasefire, and that everything depends on the right pressure on Russia. It is there that the decision must be made that they must be the ones to end the war they started. Russia doesn't care about its losses in human lives. They block all information about their losses. But they cannot block objective reality – what the Russian economy is experiencing, how Russian enterprises are shutting down, how Russian logistics are suffering losses. Sanctions can work exactly as we need. Today, I want to thank everyone around the world who is helping us – helping bring the war to an end. Today, I also approved several of our new sanctions packages, Ukraine's packages – the relevant decisions will be made soon. I held a special meeting with government officials and the Office team on our work in the European direction, with partners in the European Union and with European countries outside the EU. A few key points. I would like to thank Prime Minister of Poland Tusk, Prime Minister of the Czech Republic Fiala, Latvia, all the Baltic states, the Nordic countries, and everyone in Europe who supports the need for the European Union to be strong and honest about its commitments. We must strengthen our joint defense efforts. Every joint European defense initiative must operate at full capacity. Everything that contributes to our common security, shared economic growth, and mutual interests – everything we share must work effectively. In particular, integration must work – all processes that make Europe more united. In Ukraine, we have done a lot to ensure that Moldova stands alongside us on the European path. We are helping stabilize the situation inside Moldova so that Russian interference does not succeed. We are helping ensure the stable operation of Moldova’s energy sector. At the time, we insisted that Moldova deserved to be granted candidate status. And our position now is equally based on fairness and real merit. Ukraine has done everything to open the first cluster in the accession negotiations with the European Union. Europe recognizes this. That is why any artificial pauses, any artificial separations will only harm Europe. Ukraine and Moldova must move forward together in the negotiation process. I thank all the leaders and all the countries, the European Union, for supporting us in this, for supporting the rules in Europe. And, of course, gratitude to the warriors of Ukraine. Today is the Day of the Communications Troops of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. A day of our warriors who make the army an army, because without communications it is simply impossible to operate effectively. I thank all of you who, under any circumstances, keep our Defense Forces connected. We are proud of our people! Thank you to all our friends – friends of Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!
