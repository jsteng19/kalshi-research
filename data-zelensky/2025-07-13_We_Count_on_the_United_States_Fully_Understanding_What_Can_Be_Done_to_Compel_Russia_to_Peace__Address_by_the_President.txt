I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! Briefly about this day – it was not an easy one. A meeting with the military and the Minister of Defense – not only about the front line, but also about our further actions. Ukrainian production, deep strikes, our responses to Russian attacks. I am grateful to everyone who is truly steadfast in defending our state, our independence, and our people. Today, we also discussed the upcoming visit of General Kellogg – negotiations on further support will take place during the week. I instructed Commander-in-Chief Syrskyi and Chief of the General Staff Hnatov to present the information we have on Russia’s capabilities and our prospects. We are also preparing meetings between President Trump’s special envoy and the heads of the Security Service of Ukraine and our intelligence services. The information provided will be comprehensive. We count on the United States fully understanding what can be done to compel Russia to peace. Today, I received a report from Head of the Security Service of Ukraine Vasyl Maliuk regarding the protection of Ukrainian interests and our responses to Russian murderers. Every encroachment on Ukraine must receive a strong and severe response – and it will. Today, I also had an important conversation with Ukraine’s Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal. Tomorrow, the Government will present new social initiatives – payments to support Ukrainian mothers: payments after childbirth and support during the first years after birth. There are also dedicated funds for Ukrainian schoolchildren – for the School Starter Pack and free meals in schools from first to fourth grade, and in frontline areas – from first to last grade. The Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine will present all the details tomorrow. Today, Denys and I also discussed our steps – strategic steps – for transforming the executive branch. Changes will be made. In particular, in the defense sector and across all projects aimed at our resilience – both as a state and as a society. We need an audit of every agreement with our partners – what is actually being implemented. It is also necessary to significantly reduce non-critical state expenditures and, as much as possible, channel the efforts of society toward economic development through deregulation. The primary focus is on increasing Ukrainian production, particularly of weapons, enhancing Ukrainian strength, and expanding our capabilities. There will also be new personnel decisions in key embassies. The coming week must bring about positive changes in Ukraine’s interests. Glory to Ukraine!
