I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! Today, I held a Staff meeting, followed by a detailed separate report from Commander-in-Chief Syrskyi and Chief of the General Staff Barhylevych. First – the defense of our frontline positions, with a primary focus on Pokrovsk. I am grateful to all the brigades and every warrior currently stationed there. We discussed brigade staffing and rotations. The army needs more internal, systemic changes to ensure effective personnel management at all levels of the Defense Forces. There were also detailed reports from the responsible commanders regarding the formation and training of our brigades. Second – the Kursk operation. Today marks exactly five months since the start of our actions in the Kursk region, and we continue to maintain a buffer zone on Russian territory, actively destroying Russian military potential there. Since the beginning of the Kursk operation, the enemy has already lost over 38,000 troops in this area alone, including approximately 15,000 irrecoverable losses. The Russians have deployed their strong units to the Kursk region. Soldiers from North Korea are involved there. What’s important is that the occupier cannot currently redirect all this force to other directions, in particular the Donetsk, Sumy, Kharkiv, or Zaporizhzhia regions. I thank all our warriors who are bringing the war back to Russia and providing Ukraine with greater security and strength. Today, I also held a meeting with international relations officials to plan our meetings and negotiations for January. We are accelerating arms deliveries to Ukraine and working toward new and more long-term relations with partners. We are preparing positive diplomatic news for Ukraine. Glory to Ukraine!
