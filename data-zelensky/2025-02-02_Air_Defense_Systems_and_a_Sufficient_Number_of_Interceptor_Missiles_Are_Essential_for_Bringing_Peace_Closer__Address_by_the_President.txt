Dear Ukrainians! Just today, the rescue operations in Poltava were completed after a Russian missile strike. Unfortunately, this missile killed fourteen people, including two children – a nine-year-old and a twelve-year-old. My condolences to the families and loved ones. Twenty people were injured, including four children, ranging from a three-month-old baby to a twelve-year-old. Another twenty-two people were rescued. An entire section of the residential building – from the first to the fifth floor – was completely destroyed. And this was just one Russian missile, bringing so much pain, suffering, and loss. That is why Ukraine – and real peace – require guarantees. Guarantees that such evil will be stopped. Reliably. Not just with words or a few documents, but with something that can truly ensure the absence of Russian terror. Air defense systems and a sufficient number of interceptor missiles are essential for bringing peace closer. I am grateful to all our partners who are helping us with this and who fully understand what exactly we need. Patriots, IRIS-T, all types of necessary air defense systems, the development of drones and investments in weapons production here in Ukraine – all this is what protects the lives of our people and the very idea that peace is possible. This week, we have received new aid packages. A significant package from Sweden – $1.2 billion. Thank you, Sweden! A new security package from Finland. A package from Croatia as well. Thank you. We are working to ensure that next week also brings the crucial decisions Ukraine needs – decisions to support our state, our people, and our army. Today, I want to recognize the rescuers who have proved themselves in these difficult days and weeks. The Poltava region, first of all. The workers of the State Emergency Service of Ukraine in the region – Oleksandr Sliusar, Serhiy Chebyshev, Yuriy Kupriakov, Oleksandr Bondar, and Serhiy Morhun. Thank you, guys! From the Cherkasy region, rescuers who assisted in Poltava — Volodymyr Babak, Serhiy Serhiyenko, Oleksandr Kolomiyets, and Andriy Kutsevol. Thank you, guys!

Thank you very much! Glory to everyone who fights, works, and rescues all of us for the sake of Ukraine. Glory to Ukraine!
