Dear Ukrainians! Briefly about today. I want to thank the defenders of our skies for protecting us from “Shahed” drones and all other attack UAVs. Over a hundred “Shaheds” were launched overnight – a significant number were shot down. Not all of them, but every successful shoot-down saves our people and protects our infrastructure. There were also missile strikes today – Russian ballistics. While the whole world awaits a simple "yes" from Putin in response to the offer of direct talks – he continues to strike Ukraine. There is no military logic behind this. This is clear. It brings him nothing – and it never will. Russia is only prolonging the war, prolonging these killings. And I want to thank every country, every leader who is now putting pressure on Russia, so that the shelling finally stops, so that meaningful negotiations can take place at a level where real decisions can be made. To everyone helping peace and helping diplomacy – thank you. Today, there was a very important statement from Pope Leo XIV, expressing the Vatican’s willingness to play a mediatory role. The Vatican can help diplomacy. There is support for a direct meeting from Global South leaders – and that voice is being heard. We also know China’s position regarding a ceasefire and negotiations. The position of the United States and Europe is absolutely clear. In fact, it is now more evident than ever to everyone in the world since the beginning of the full-scale war – it is evident that the sole remaining obstacle to peace is Russia’s lack of clear will to do it. Today, we held several meetings with the team regarding the format in Türkiye. I am waiting to see who will come from Russia, and then I will decide which steps Ukraine should take. So far, the signals from them in the media are unconvincing. But we also hear that President Trump is considering attending the meeting in Türkiye. That could become the strongest argument. This week really may change a lot — but only may… Everything is being decided right now. I want to commend our warriors. At this time, it is very important. Commander-in-Chief Syrskyi delivered reports today on the situation at the front – across all directions. Every day, there are over a hundred battles. The heaviest fighting is in the Pokrovsk sector and other areas in our Donetsk region. We are continuing our active operations in the Kursk and Belgorod regions – we are proactively defending Ukraine’s border areas. But all these combat actions are not our choice – they are our defense, defense against the occupier. The answers to all the questions about this war – why it began and why it continues – all these answers lie in Moscow. How the war ends depends on the world. Ukraine is ready for any format of negotiations, and we are not afraid of meetings. Tomorrow – in Türkiye. Glory to Ukraine!
