Dear Ukrainians! We are returning home. As a result of these days, there is clear support from Europe. Even greater unity, even stronger readiness for cooperation. Everyone is united on the main point – for peace to be real, real security guarantees are needed. And this is the position of all of our Europe – of the entire continent. The United Kingdom, the European Union, Norway, Türkiye. Today, we coordinated our positions. There will be many meetings and joint efforts in the coming days and weeks. There will be diplomacy for peace. And for the sake of all of us standing together – Ukraine, the whole of Europe, and necessarily America. Of course, we understand the importance of America, and we are grateful for all the support we have received from the United States. There hasn't been a single day when we haven't felt grateful. Because this is gratitude for the preservation of our independence: our resilience in Ukraine is built upon what our partners do for us and for their own security. We need peace, not endless war. And that is why we say that security guarantees are the key to this. In the near future, all of us in Europe will shape our common positions – the lines we must achieve and the lines we cannot compromise on. These positions will be presented to our partners in the United States. Robust and lasting peace, and the right agreement on the end of the war are truly our shared priority. And, of course, I want to thank you, all of you – everyone in our beloved Ukraine who feels how much unity matters and how history changes when millions defend the dignity of their country. Our warriors on the frontline, all our people – I am proud of you. I want to thank all of you. Thank you very much! Glory to Ukraine!
