Dear Ukrainians! Today, we thank our Air Force warriors – it is their professional day. Heroic people. Today, I personally expressed gratitude to them, presented awards, and also heard very important reports on the development of our Air Force, all of its components: combat aviation, our anti-aircraft missile forces, and radio-technical forces – every element is being given the strength it deserves. This year alone, our Air Force received Mirages – combat aircraft from France – as well as additional F-16s. And more are coming. Today, we also approved the next stages in the development of our combat aviation – new platforms and new steps in integrating our forces with the forces of partners. Our goal is the full and effective integration of the Air Force of Ukraine with NATO forces – something that will undoubtedly give Ukraine’s defense greater capabilities and, at the same time, make our country an even stronger part of Europe’s defense. The system for managing and developing our combat aviation is functioning in a comprehensive manner — within the Armed Forces, the General Staff, and the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. I want to thank all the specialists involved. Today, I appointed Anatolii Kryvonozhko as Commander of the Air Force – he had been serving as Acting Commander for nearly a year, and much has been accomplished. It is important for everyone to continue working as one team – across state institutions, with partners, and with the professional community. There was also a report today from the Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council – in particular, on preparations for upcoming meetings of the Staff. Among the issues on the agenda are the state of air defense and the new systems that will arrive in Ukraine. We are preparing for the heating season, and, of course, strengthening air defense, anti-shahed solutions, and our domestic weapons production are among the elements of our preparations for winter. The condition of critical infrastructure and the necessary decisions regarding it will also be addressed at the Staff. Rustem Umerov also reported today on his communication with the Russian side: an exchange of 1,200 of our people who are currently in captivity is being prepared. We must bring everyone home – all our military personnel and all our civilians. No matter how difficult it may be. Head of the Office Andriy Yermak reported on communication with our partners, in particular with the Americans: the United States is committed to providing support. I would like to express my gratitude for that. Pressure on Russia can truly work – in a way that makes them feel the consequences of prolonging the war. I also held a meeting today on our sanctions policy. Three sanctions packages have been prepared, and the first one has already been enacted today. Sanctions have been imposed on the captains of Russia’s shadow fleet, and we will synchronize all of this – all of these packages – with our partners to ensure the pressure is effective across most jurisdictions. I have approved the synchronization of our partners’ sanctions in our jurisdiction for next week – all necessary decisions by partners must be mirrored by Ukrainian sanctions. And one more thing. I want to thank our people in the Kherson region, in Mykolaiv, in our cities and communities in the South, in our Kharkiv region, in the Sumy region. Everywhere where Russian strikes are constant – targeting ordinary buildings, energy infrastructure, and essentially just people’s lives. And there is always restoration work underway, and our people always do their absolute best to save others. Thank you! Thanks! I thank everyone who works like this – for the sake of our country and our people. Thank you to everyone who stands with Ukraine. Glory to Ukraine!
