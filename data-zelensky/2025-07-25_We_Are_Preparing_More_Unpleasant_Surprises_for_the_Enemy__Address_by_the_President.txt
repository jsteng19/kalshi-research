I wish you good health, fellow Ukrainians! Today, I held a meeting of the Staff. Reports were presented by our intelligence agencies – the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine and the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine – regarding the challenges expected this summer and autumn, as well as Russia’s intentions. We had a detailed discussion about the threats that must be addressed. There was also a report on the operational situation, delivered by Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi. All operational areas were covered, with Pokrovsk receiving primary focus. In the Sumy region, we continue to take action along the border. I also want to thank all our units operating on Russian territory. The Minister of Defense reported on the delivery of assistance from our partners – we are ensuring the reliable transfer of weapons to Ukrainian warriors. I have instructed preparations to begin for a Technology Staff meeting – specifically on drones. A plan has been approved to reach the amount of 500 to 1,000 interceptors per day, which is not easy. Per day within a defined timeframe, and this is a matter of personal responsibility for all our officials involved. Today, I was in the region and visited one of the companies producing drones – this specific type, the interceptors. I thanked the team very much – they are a truly fantastic team of manufacturers. I am grateful to the developers and to all developers who are advancing this very effort, scaling it directly within our forces and in our defense. We are contracting everything we can – at maximum capacity. We are ensuring funding for all drone manufacturers – of all types of drones. I also visited today one of the medical centers of the Ministry of Internal Affairs – a center specializing in post-injury rehabilitation for our military personnel. I spoke with the guys and presented them with state awards. You know that such gratitude to our warriors, to all our people defending the state by protecting its independence, is always important. Documents are currently being prepared, along with all the necessary submissions, to confer the titles of Hero of Ukraine on several Ukrainian warriors. The decrees will be issued soon. I also held meetings today on preparing legislative decisions that we are planning to implement in the near future. And of course, our communication with all partners continues to ensure that not a single day is lost this summer, which could add pressure on Russia. I am grateful to the European leaders. I want to thank the United States of America – the pressure on the aggressor is not weakening, and that is crucial. We are preparing more unpleasant surprises for the enemy. I thank everyone who is helping Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!
