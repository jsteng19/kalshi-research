I wish you good health, fellow Ukrainians! Today’s events. The main thing: an exchange took place. And this is the first stage of the largest exchange agreed upon in Türkiye. In fact, it is the only significant outcome of the meeting in Türkiye – everything else is being blocked by the Russians. Blocked for now. But bringing our people back is exactly what we always work for. We will definitely bring everyone back. Every one of our citizens, every Ukrainian servicemember and civilian, all Ukrainian hostages held in Russia – we must free all of them. Today, almost four hundred, 390 people are back home – both military and civilians. Tomorrow and the day after, the next stages will follow. The formula is a thousand for a thousand. I am grateful to everyone and to our entire team involved in carrying out the exchange. And certainly, I thank all our warriors at the front who specifically ensure the replenishment of Ukraine’s exchange fund. And also, I want to thank our law enforcement officers for adding Russian saboteurs and collaborationists to the exchange fund. What matters most is that Ukraine is bringing its people home. I thank everyone around the world who is helping us. And just as we succeed in this, we must succeed in everything else. A ceasefire is needed. Diplomatic steps toward real peace are needed. A new and effective security architecture is needed. We are bringing our partners together to make this happen. And it is clearly time to increase pressure on Russia to achieve not just one result, but everything that is necessary. And when Russia takes a whole week just to come up with a so-called “memorandum” as their response to calls for a ceasefire – this is nothing but a mockery of the entire world. So much time wasted! Every day of this war costs lives. Of course, in Russia, lives don’t count. But the world must count them. New sanctions against Russia are needed. I thank everyone who is advocating for and supporting this. And a few more things. Today, I recognized our marines with state awards on their professional day. Every marine brigade is a source of pride. And that is truly deserved. There was also a report by Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha today. Regarding the tasks assigned to him. The first is to ensure additional funding for artillery production – for shells. There is a result: two-thirds of the funds have already been secured. The second is additional funding for drone production in Ukraine. The funds will be provided. The third: we are preparing for Ukraine’s participation in the G7 format. I thank the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for their work. I also spoke today with the Prime Minister of Croatia, Plenković. He is a true friend of Ukraine and of all who want a strong and secure Europe. We discussed the situation in general, both at the front and in diplomacy. We also discussed preparations for the Ukraine – Southeast Europe Summit. I am grateful that the Prime Minister of Croatia is ready to attend the Summit. There was one more report today – we are preparing new sanctions packages. Strong sanctions packages. I thank everyone who stands with us, with Ukraine, with Ukrainians! Glory to Ukraine!
