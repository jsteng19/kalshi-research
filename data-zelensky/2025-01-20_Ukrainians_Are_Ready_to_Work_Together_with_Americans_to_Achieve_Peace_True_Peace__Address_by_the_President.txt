I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! Today, the Security Service of Ukraine, the State Bureau of Investigation, the National Police, and the Prosecutor's Office are also doing a good job of ensuring justice in Ukraine, particularly in military affairs. Wealthy draft officers, situations like those in the Kharkiv region when the Russian army attempted to occupy our land and advance on Kharkiv again, and criminal errors in brigade management – all these issues require thorough investigation and just responses. I thank law enforcers for today’s efforts, and it is essential for people to feel that no status or past achievements can override the rule of law. I held a meeting of the Staff today – many issues were discussed, including our domestic production and equipment repairs. Our defense industry, our defense production, is an absolute priority. Today, the Speaker of the Lithuanian Seimas visited Ukraine. We discussed further cooperation between our states and our nations. I am grateful for the support of all Lithuanians, all our friends. I would like to thank Gitanas, the President of Lithuania. And I am confident that the kind of unity we have between our countries, between Ukraine and Lithuania, is exactly what all of Europe needs now – so that we can achieve security for ourselves and for everyone in Europe. Right now, there is a good opportunity for this.The inauguration of the new President of the United States, Donald Trump. He is a strong person. I wish President Trump and all of America success. Ukrainians are ready to work together with Americans to achieve peace, true peace. This is an opportunity that must be seized. Glory to Ukraine!
