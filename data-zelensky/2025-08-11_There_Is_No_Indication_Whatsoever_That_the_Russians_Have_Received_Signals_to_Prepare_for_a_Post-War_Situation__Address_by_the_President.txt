I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! The key points for today. I held a Staff meeting – a special meeting focused specifically on the issues raised by our servicemembers. When I visited the Kharkiv and Sumy regions, these were exactly the questions they asked. Regarding pickup trucks and other equipment – the matter has been resolved. The brigades will receive both the necessary funds directly and the ability to purchase exactly the pickup trucks, ATVs, and other equipment they need. Combat brigades will get this opportunity very soon. The government is to make a decision already this week. The funds have also been allocated. A very important point is that we are increasing the funds available to the brigades for procurement. This is direct financing, which will provide more opportunities to meet combat needs. This includes drones and more. We have agreed to change the approach to determining the amount of funding. There will be more funds for each combat brigade – the calculation is as follows: 7 million hryvnias for each battalion engaged in combat missions. Of course, we continue to cut bureaucracy. Writing off property and equipment will become easier. Corps commanders and brigade commanders will be able to process write-offs even faster. I gave instructions to immediately resolve the important issue of the timeframe for presenting state awards to our warriors. Too much time passes between the submission for an award and its presentation. Far too much time. The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine has already identified which documents and approvals are unnecessary – all will be streamlined. The award documents will also be changed – instead of the old award booklets, there will be new documents that do not need to be filled out by hand. The timeframes must be such that people can truly feel respect for themselves and for their actions in defending our state. Decisions are also being prepared on other fundamental matters. Issues of motivation, personnel, training centers, and communication down to the battalion and company level – all of this has also been worked through. The decisions will be made. Today, our team delivered a report following meetings in the United Kingdom. Andriy Yermak and Rustem Umerov reported on all important discussions – both public and non-public details. I would like to thank everyone who stands with Ukraine. Today, there was also a report from the intelligence and military command on what Putin is counting on and what he is actually preparing for, including military preparations. He is definitely not preparing for a ceasefire or an end to the war. Putin is determined only to present a meeting with America as his personal victory and then continue acting exactly as before, applying the same pressure on Ukraine as before. So far, there is no indication whatsoever that the Russians have received signals to prepare for a post-war situation. On the contrary, they are redeploying their troops and forces in ways that suggest preparations for new offensive operations. If someone is preparing for peace, this is not what he does. We continue to keep our partners informed about the real situation on the battlefield, in diplomacy, and in Russia’s planning of further actions. Today, I have already spoken with the Prime Minister of Canada, the Crown Prince and Prime Minister of Saudi Arabia, and the President of Lithuania. Later today, further talks with European friends are planned. I thank everyone for their support. An important conversation took place with the Prime Minister of India. Everyone is united by an understanding of clear facts. First – Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity must be respected. Second – issues concerning the war against Ukraine must be resolved only with Ukraine’s participation. Third – Russia must take the necessary steps to end this war. So far, Russia has not taken a single step. Today, Prime Minister Modi and I discussed in great detail the possibilities for influencing Russia’s position. I remember how the Prime Minister of India has said more than once that our time is not a time for war. And real steps are needed to make this a reality – peace is needed. Tomorrow will also be a day of our active communication with partners. At all levels, we continue to engage with the United States of America. The Office team, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and everyone needed for effective work – all are involved. And I thank everyone in Ukraine who firmly supports and strengthens the state’s position and our defense of national interests. We stand strong – all together. And one more thing. Today, I want to recognize our warriors – our border guard warriors. Together with all those serving in the Defense Forces, our border guards defend Ukraine on the frontline and, of course, in the border areas – along our state border that is recognized by everyone. The “Hart,” “Steel Border,” and “Forpost” border guard brigades, the units of the Sumy, Kharkiv, Volyn, and Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi border guard detachments. The border guards of the “Pomsta” brigade and the “Phoenix” unit. I thank you for your resilience, for destroying the occupier! Ukraine must achieve its goals, and these goals are just: to protect lives, to defend independence, and to secure a dignified peace for Ukraine. Thank you all. Glory to Ukraine!
