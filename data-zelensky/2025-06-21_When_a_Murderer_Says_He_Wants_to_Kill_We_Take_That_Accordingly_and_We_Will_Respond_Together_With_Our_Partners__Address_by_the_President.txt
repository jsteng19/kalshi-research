I wish you good health, fellow Ukrainians! I have just received a report from the Security Service of Ukraine, from the Head of the Service, Vasyl Maliuk. Today, I also spoke with the Commander-in-Chief and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine. Yesterday, everyone heard the signals from Russia’s leader. Whether it was bravado or madness on his part – it can be interpreted in any way. But when a murderer says he wants to kill, we take that accordingly, and we will respond together with our partners. I hope, with all our partners. Yesterday, Putin put on a performance, particularly for the United States too, and he spoke completely openly. Yes, he wants all of Ukraine – and he had wanted it not just for four years, not just since 2014, but long before that, because he himself was shaped that way by Russian imperialism. And when he speaks about Ukraine and something else about Russian soldiers’ boots on the ground, he is also speaking about Belarus, the Baltic states, Moldova, the Caucasus, countries like Kazakhstan, and every place on Earth that Russian killers can reach. Putin’s power ends where the capabilities of Russian killers end. Of course, we will find Ukrainian drones for every boot of a Russian occupier. Of course, Ukraine will defend itself. We all clearly understand that the issue of Ukraine’s independence is a matter of survival for Ukrainians. Over these years under Putin, the Russians have gone further, much further than the Gulag and many other things of the past. They burn cities, they burn villages to the ground, leaving only ruins and no human life. Anyone in the world can see what Putin has absolutely deliberately done to Donbas. Donbas has been essentially destroyed. And it was them in Moscow who once claimed they would bring protection to Donbas. What they actually brought was death – and this is the only thing they know how to deliver. Our communities in the Kharkiv region, in the border areas of our Sumy region, and in the Kherson region – the Russians are doing the same thing everywhere. Ukraine is grateful to everyone around the world who helps strengthen our defense, who supports our warriors, and all our people. We are grateful to everyone who enforces truly strong sanctions against Russia and blocks schemes that enable trade with Russia. We are grateful to everyone advancing diplomacy. But it is Russia that rejects peace proposals. And not just some – all of them: American, and, by the way, Chinese, European, Brazilian, African, Indian. Regardless of who says the war must be stopped, Putin doesn’t listen. It is Putin who speaks openly to the world about which cities he threatens and which nations he claims don’t exist. We hope President Trump hears this – and sees how Putin is now trying to prolong even the Iranian regime’s survival, just to buy more time for his own madness and the murder of thousands. A response is clearly needed. Everyone in the world must choose where they stand. On our part, we in Ukraine have adopted a number of new decisions, taking into account the frankness of the Russian murderers who openly declare that they do not intend to stop. First, there will be new international measures on our part to achieve truly tangible international sanctions against Russia. We know every target for international sanctions. I have assigned separate work engaging the global corporate sector, particularly those maintaining connections of the Russian energy and defense industries with the world. We are also intensifying all sanctions-related work within Ukraine – internal efforts so that everyone who still helps Russia, cooperates with it in any way, or maintains businesses in the occupied territories – so that each such individual feels that this is absolutely criminal activity. Justice must be ensured, including through domestic decisions. Second, we will allocate more resources to our drones of all types, from deep-strike drones to concrete protection against Russian boots on the frontline. Third, we will make changes to certain staff positions, including within the Ukrainian diplomatic corps and institutional management, to increase Ukraine’s potential both in relations with partners and in internal Ukrainian resilience. As for the diplomatic corps, in a month – including through a meeting with all Ukrainian ambassadors – we will draw conclusions about this transformation. Currently, this is a month of special measures aimed at applying new pressure on Russia – on the occupier – to complicate their situation, thereby simplifying our path to peace. Details of today’s instructions to the Head of the Security Service of Ukraine remain confidential. Separately, the National Security and Defense Council will issue decisions; they are currently being prepared. And we will provide virtually daily updates on what Ukrainian diplomats are doing to achieve our Ukrainian goals. The defense of Ukraine, the protection of our independence, and the strengthening of our sovereignty – all of this is about saving lives. I thank everyone who stands with Ukraine! I have absolute confidence in Ukrainians. Glory to Ukraine!
