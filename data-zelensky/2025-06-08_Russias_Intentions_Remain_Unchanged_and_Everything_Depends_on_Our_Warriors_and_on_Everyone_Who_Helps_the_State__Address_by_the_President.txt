I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! We are already preparing for the upcoming international events in the coming weeks. Important meetings and negotiations will take place in Ukraine. We are also doing everything to ensure that the June summits – the G7 Summit in Canada and the NATO Summit in the Netherlands – are not hollow. A lot depends on Europe’s resolve, as well as on our relations with the United States. I’m grateful to everyone helping to keep those relations grounded in reality. We must increase pressure on Moscow. We must tighten sanctions. We must explore ways to use frozen Russian assets to support our defense. Russia only truly understands one language — the language of force. That is precisely the language that must become the working one across all formats of international engagement in the coming months. I’ve spoken both today and yesterday with Defense Minister Umerov, Chief of the Defense Intelligence Budanov, and Head of the Security Service of Ukraine Maliuk – Ukraine continues to do everything possible to secure the release of our POWs and the return of our fallen Ukrainian warriors. Unfortunately, the full lists from Russia for the exchange of over one thousand people, as agreed in Istanbul, have still not been provided. In typical fashion, the Russian side is once again trying to turn even these matters into a dirty political and information game. It’s important to achieve the result. It’s important that people be brought back home. We believe we'll be able to keep the exchange track moving forward. And for our part, we are doing everything we can to make it happen. And if the Russians fail to comply with agreements even on such humanitarian issues, it will cast serious doubt on all international efforts – in particular those of the United States – regarding negotiations and diplomacy. Today, Commander-in-Chief Syrskyi delivered a report. The Pokrovsk direction, the Lyman direction, other directions in the Donetsk region, as well as the situation along Ukraine’s border in the Sumy and Kharkiv regions. In some areas, the situation is very difficult, but everything depends on the resilience of our units. I want to thank each and every one who ensures Ukraine’s defense. Russia’s intentions remain unchanged, and everything depends on our Defense and Security Forces of Ukraine – on our warriors and on everyone who helps the state. This week, I would like to especially commend the warriors of the 68th Separate Jaeger Brigade and the 72nd Separate Mechanized Brigade for their results in the Pokrovsk direction. In the areas of the Kursk operation, the 33rd and 225th Assault Regiments have been particularly effective. In the Lyman direction, special thanks go to our warriors of the 66th Separate Mechanized Brigade. I thank everyone who is fighting for Ukraine and everyone who works for our state and our people. And be sure to pay attention to air raid alerts these days. Please take care of yourselves. Take care of yourselves and Ukraine. Glory to Ukraine!
