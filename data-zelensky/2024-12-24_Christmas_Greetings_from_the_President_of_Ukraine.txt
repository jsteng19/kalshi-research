This is the sound of light. This is the sound of a miracle. This is the sound of life. This is the sound of Christmas. Our "Shchedryk." Our Leontovych. Our history, which carries especially profound symbolism in times of war. The great Ukrainian composer Mykola Leontovych spent several years living and working in the city now known as Pokrovsk. There, he taught music to children, formed a choir, and it was in that very place that he composed the second edition of "Shchedryk," which is heard in every corner of the world these days. This is how a Ukrainian gifted the world the musical spirit of Christmas. And may everyone in the world remember Ukraine when they hear it. The way we are fighting today for the main symbol of this holiday – for hope and for the triumph of life. On our land, in every city and town, including Pokrovsk. The divine music composed there and the evil that russia brought there sharply illustrate the difference between us and them. We strive to create, while for some, the meaning of life is to sow death. We seek harmony, seek justice – we want peace. All we need is to live peacefully on our own land, to see the sun, our sky, and in it – a Christmas star, not Iranian Shaheds and russian missiles. But for some, life feels "boring and lacks excitement." These words are proof of how far they are from God, from Christianity, and from true faith. And this is proof of why their bondage and darkness will lose. We know this. The world knows this. And God knows this. Evil will be defeated. Ukrainians believe this and pray for it – pray for all this evil and filth to vanish from our land forever. And Ukrainians undoubtedly deserve it. Dear nation! Tonight is a very special evening. Christmas Eve. And this is our third Christmas during wartime. Our great Ukrainian family cannot fully celebrate it the way we would like to, the way it should be celebrated. Not all of us are home, unfortunately. Sadly, not everyone has a home. And tragically, not everyone is with us. Yet, despite all the hardships brought by the enemy, they have failed to take or destroy what matters most – our hearts, the light within us, our faith in goodness and mercy, and the humanity that lives in each of us. We have not lost our values, and that is why today we honor all those who gave their lives defending us. We pray today for everyone on the frontlines – to return alive. For all those in captivity – to come back home. For all those russia has driven into occupation. For all those it has forced to leave. For all those who face hardships but have not lost Ukraine within themselves – and because of that, Ukraine will never lose them. That is why, no matter where we are today, we are definitely together. For the second time, we celebrate Christmas on the same date as one big family, one country. For the second time in modern history, Christmas unites all Ukrainians. Today we are side by side. And we will not get lost. Whether in person or in our minds, we will greet each other, call our parents, kiss our children, hug our loved ones, and remember those close to us. In person, from afar, or in our hearts – Ukrainians are together today. And as long as we do this, evil has no chance. This unity and warmth toward one another are the true spirit of Christmas – the unique atmosphere that we will preserve within ourselves and share with those around us. With everyone we love. With everyone who is so dear to us. And today, that means every Ukrainian. Merry Christmas to all of you! May the light of faith shine in our souls, may our hearts be filled with hope, and may every home be blessed with love and abundance. May the Lord protect you, your families, and our Ukraine. With His help, may all the evil that entered our home disappear, replaced by goodness and justice. May there be peace and prosperity. And may every child be healthy, delight in their gifts, smile, and – despite everything – feel the joy of this holiday. And may the most precious thing – the sparkle of happiness in children’s eyes – be seen. This is what we are fighting for. This is what we are praying for. This is what we deserve. Merry Christmas, dear Ukrainians! Christ is born! Glorify Him!
