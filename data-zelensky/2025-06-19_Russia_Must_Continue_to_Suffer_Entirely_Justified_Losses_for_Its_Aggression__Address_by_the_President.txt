Dear Ukrainians! This morning, I visited the site where a Russian missile struck a residential building in Kyiv. An ordinary apartment building. The missile went through every floor, all the way down to the basement. 23 people were killed by this single Russian strike alone. My condolences to their families and loved ones. The rescue operation lasted nearly 40 hours – until the very last moment, rescuers were trying to pull people out alive from under the rubble. In total, with that massive strike on Ukraine, the Russians killed 30 people and injured 172. There was no military purpose to this strike whatsoever. It brought Russia absolutely nothing in military terms. It was deliberate terror, the same thing Russia’s army under Putin has done everywhere, from Chechnya to Syria. This is the only thing Putin and his Russia truly know how to do well – kill and destroy. And this is exactly the dimension that unites Russia with regimes like those currently in Iran and North Korea. Right now, Russia is trying to save Iran’s nuclear program, there’s no other way to interpret its public signals and behind-the-scenes activity. When one of their accomplices loses the ability to export war, Russia suffers, and tries to intervene. This is cynicism at its worst. And this, time and again, proves that aggressive regimes must not be allowed to unite and become partners. When Iranian Shahed drones – now significantly upgraded – and ballistic missiles from North Korea – also modernized – kill our people in Ukraine, it is a clear sign that global solidarity and global pressure are not enough. Sanctions must be ramped up significantly. We must greatly enhance our cooperation – especially in the technological sphere – among all those around the world who are defending life. This is exactly what we agreed on with partners recently in Canada – at the G7 Summit. And we will continue discussing it next week through other formats of our cooperation in Europe, particularly within the framework of the Coalition of the Willing. I held a meeting on sanctions today. A very important meeting. I instructed the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, the intelligence services, and the entire team of our state to propose to our partners new formats of sanctions coordination – and this will be done. I also instructed to step up all the efforts necessary to synchronize sanctions – the sanctions of partners against Russia within our jurisdiction, and Ukrainian sanctions within jurisdictions around the world. The task is clear: everything that reduces Russia’s ability to finance the war simultaneously increases the chance for real peace. There were also meetings today with our military and Ukraine’s Minister of Defense: Syrskyi, Hnatov, Palisa, Umerov. Separately, I also met with the team of the Security Service of Ukraine and General Horbatiuk regarding deep strikes. Russia must continue to suffer entirely justified losses for its aggression. I thank all our warriors, every unit of ours that makes this possible. Today I also signed a decree appointing the Commander of the Land Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine – Brigadier General Hennadii Shapovalov, who had been carrying out tasks in Wiesbaden, Germany, coordinating with our NATO partners. All the positive experience of coordination and all the real combat experience of our warriors must now be implemented within the Land Forces of Ukraine. Change is needed – and it is a must. And one more thing. The return of Ukrainians from Russian captivity. For the fifth time in a few weeks. Men from the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the National Guard, our State Border Guard Service. Many of them had been in captivity since 2022, including since the defense of Mariupol. We must bring back every single one of our men – and we will. We are working on every name. What is needed is an “all-for-all” exchange – so that every family is reunited with their loved ones. So that there are no ultimatums. A real ceasefire is needed. A real end to the war is needed. Ukraine is ready to meet at the highest level – that is the level where actual decisions are made. I am ready to meet in any format with those who make decisions and hold the proper authority, including Putin, even though he has overstayed his constitutional term limit by at least three terms. And hopefully, the war can be brought to an end during President Trump’s current term. I count heavily on his help. I count heavily on the influence of the United States. That is something that can make a difference. Sanctions are needed. Diplomacy is needed. Security is needed. Glory to Ukraine!
