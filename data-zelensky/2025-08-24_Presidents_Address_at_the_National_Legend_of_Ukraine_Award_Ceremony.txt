Glory to Ukraine! Dear attendees, dear Ukrainians, dear legends, ladies and gentlemen! First of all, I welcome all of you to the “National Legend of Ukraine” ceremony! And this year it is special. It marks its first milestone – five years since its establishment. I remember well that day in a very important year for our country, for our independence – the 30th anniversary of Ukraine’s independence. In the Mariyinsky Palace, under our peaceful Ukrainian sky, a new and very important tradition of great state and public respect was born. A very beautiful one. A very dignified one. And, in my view, a very right one. Because it is so important when the state notices and honors people who devote their lives to it. When Ukraine sincerely says “thank you” to outstanding Ukrainians who have done and continue to do significant and great deeds – in the 20th century, from the beginning of our independence, or in times of this great war. When we know for certain: we have people to be proud of. And we know for certain: the legends are among us. And it is so important to have the opportunity to honor them while they are still with us. To give them applause they can hear. To present them with awards they can come up to the stage to receive. And it is so important not to forget those who, unfortunately, are no longer with us. Our legends who are now in heaven, but who are still with us. Through their stories, their work, and their legacy, they are with us, here, among our people, with Ukraine. And I am very glad that for the fifth year in a row, despite the war, despite Russia’s attempt to take everything from us, we continue this tradition. Ukraine honors its legends – those who inspire us all, those to whom the world applauds. And, as is tradition, I would like to introduce each and every one of them today. For over six decades of his life, he devoted himself to strengthening our state. One of the authors of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Concept, the first National Space Program, and the strategy for the development and modernization of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. He is often called the father of the missile and space industry of independent Ukraine. An academician, a Hero of Ukraine, and a national legend of our Ukraine’s defense capability – Volodymyr Pavlovych Horbulin. International critics call her the successor to Maria Callas, Montserrat Caballé, and Solomiya Krushelnytska. She has conquered all the world’s leading opera stages: La Scala, the Metropolitan Opera, Covent Garden. She is regarded as the world’s finest performer of the role in Aida. A national legend of Ukrainian and global opera – Liudmyla Monastyrska. Almost every day of his life means a life saved. His medical team in the Dnipro region handled one of the largest flows of wounded – our heroes, our warriors. He has been directly involved in helping more than 20,000 of our wounded defenders. He has provided aid to fighters from 55 military units in the Donetsk region and in our Kharkiv region. A captain of the medical service, commander of a medical company of our Land Forces, father of four children, doctor, savior of thousands of warriors, and a national legend of Ukraine – Andriy Semyankiv. This year, he celebrated a milestone – his 80th birthday. Most of those years, he has given our people his incredible voice. Many of the songs he performed have become part of the golden treasury of Ukrainian music of the 20th century. And the best proof of this is the millions of Ukrainians of completely different generations who love him and his music, and who are still filled with admiration and pride when they recall the legendary first performance of Chervona Ruta as part of the iconic trio. Hero of Ukraine, a national legend of the Ukrainian popular music scene – Vasyl Ivanovych Zinkevych. In every sense of the word, she proves that Ukrainians are capable of reaching any heights. Ukrainians can conquer any summit. Ukrainians are winners by spirit. She brings glory to our nation, to our sport, to our character. And even today – literally, at this very moment – while conquering a new height at the Diamond League stage in Lausanne (the National Legend of Ukraine award ceremony took place on August 20 – ed.). We are, without a doubt, rooting for her, sincerely believe in her victory, and congratulate her on this award today. Olympic champion in Paris, multiple world and European champion, the youngest national legend in the history of our state – Yaroslava Mahuchikh. His language is the language of color. A fusion of hues that, like nerve cells, evoke a feeling – a feeling of beauty, a feeling of Ukraine. Anyone who has seen his legendary series Ukrainian Motif would agree. He is called the most valuable Ukrainian artist for setting records in sales of contemporary Ukrainian art on the global art market. But I am certain that his paintings are priceless to all of us. Because they are about something far greater than the material – they are about Ukrainian beauty and Ukrainian soul. Unique and captivating. A national legend of Ukrainian painting – Anatoly Dmytrovych Kryvolap. He was called the god of dance and the benevolent genius of 20th-century ballet. One of the greatest dancers of modern times. Founder of the Dance Academy at the Paris Grand Opera. Honorary President of the UNESCO International Dance Council. For his contribution to culture, Charles de Gaulle offered him French citizenship, but he politely declined, as he always identified himself as a Kyiv native, as a Ukrainian. This year, we mark the 120th anniversary of his birth. A national legend of world ballet, the great and brilliant Serge Lifar. During the Second World War, he and his family were deported from their homeland. He was forced to leave Ukraine, but Ukraine remained in his heart. Throughout all these years, he preserved this vital connection – a bond with his native land, with Ukrainian culture, with the Ukrainian people. His foundation has been supporting hundreds of projects for our people – both in Canada and in Ukraine – for decades. And, according to experts, the total amount of his contributions is simply impossible to calculate precisely. A few years ago, he was inducted into Canada’s Walk of Fame. And today, he is receiving well-deserved recognition from his native Ukraine – a Ukraine that values him, that says: “Thank you for everything.” Philanthropist, a national legend of Ukraine – James Temerty. One day, many books will be written about them. One day, many films will be made about this operation. These are special recipients of this award in the entire history of its existence. We cannot show their faces, we cannot reveal their names, but to understand their contribution to the modern history of Ukraine, one word is enough: Spiderweb. More than a year of preparation. Only a handful of people knew the details. Four Russian airfields attacked. Forty-one enemy aircraft destroyed or damaged – virtually a third of Russia’s strategic aviation. This is a legendary operation that has already gone down in world history, showcasing the capabilities of our Ukrainian special services and our state. One day, you will learn every nuance, every detail, every name. But for now, this achievement deserves our applause. A national legend of this war, of Ukraine’s security – the Security Service of Ukraine, Operation “Spiderweb.” We can recognize his voice among a million others. And for us, he has long been more than just a musician and a poet. A symbol of several generations. Without a doubt – the voice of a nation. Through his music, you can hear what lives inside millions of our people. Yes, in the soul, in the heart. This is how the Ukrainian soul sounds – Ukrainian love, Ukrainian pain, Ukrainian strength, and, without a doubt, our spirit. For everyone who, to this music, lights up the flashlights on their phones, igniting a spark in their hearts. When each of us says: “I won’t give up without a fight.” When each of us knows that everything will be alright. When everyone believes that the day will come, the war will end… and we will embrace each other. So gently. And we will never let go again. A national legend of Ukraine, of our Ukrainian music – Sviatoslav Vakarchuk. Ladies and Gentlemen, The concept of this year’s award is “United by a Legendary Country.” This is reflected in the broad geography of our legends: from the capital to all our beautiful cities, to our small villages in every corner of our state. All this together proves how unique our Ukrainian land is. It has a magic that has given Ukraine and the whole world outstanding, talented, strong, and beautiful people throughout history. Ukrainian men and women who deserve to nurture the gifts granted to them by God and by this land, in peace, in safety, in an environment free from war. We are doing everything to make such times Ukraine's new reality. To finally achieve a just peace. To ensure that future National Legend ceremonies take place just as the very first one did – in an incredible atmosphere: a Ukrainian evening under the magnificent sky of an independent Ukraine. We believe in this. We are working for this. And we will achieve this – united for that very goal. Thank you! Thank you to our warriors!
