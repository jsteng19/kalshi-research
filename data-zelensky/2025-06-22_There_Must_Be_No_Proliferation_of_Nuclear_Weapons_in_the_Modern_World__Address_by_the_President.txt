Dear Ukrainians! It was an eventful day. At this moment, rescue operations are still ongoing in Kramatorsk at the site of a Russian strike. Aerial bombs – right on the city, right on residential buildings. People were trapped under the rubble. All necessary emergency services were deployed. As of now, it is known that four people were injured – including a child. Tragically, four people were killed in this Russian attack. My condolences go out to all families and loved ones. I am also expecting a full report on the consequences and all circumstances of the Russian missile strike on a training ground in the south of Ukraine. This strike took place today. Unfortunately, it is not the first such attack. Tragically, there are killed and wounded. Full accountability is required. Today, I had an extended conversation with Minister of Internal Affairs Klymenko – in particular, about the protection of our positions on the front line and the use of our drones by the units of the National Guard of Ukraine. Today, I also spoke with Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi. Everything must be set up in a systematic way so that Russian drones – Russian reconnaissance drones – are destroyed, and destroyed as swiftly as possible. This week, I will also speak separately with partners about additional funding for the production of interceptor drones. Interceptors, frontline drones, fiber-optic drones, and all types of drones used to strike targets on Russian territory must be funded in a way that delivers real impact. This will be ensured – and we've already secured preliminary agreements with some of our partners, particularly a number of European countries. Today, Norway’s Minister of Defense visited Ukraine. A decision has been reached to invest $400 million in our production – new funding, primarily for drones. We are working together to create all the necessary conditions to produce air defense systems in Ukraine – jointly with partners, jointly with Norway. Steps in that direction are being taken. An office has already been opened in Ukraine by one of Europe’s largest defense companies – Norway’s largest, Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace. We are expediting all processes to the maximum extent. Today, I also received detailed reports from our intelligence services – the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine and the Foreign Intelligence Service. First and foremost, they concerned Russia's intentions and our defense against them. The key objective Moscow is pursuing is to undermine sanctions. They are using all available methods to bargain not only to prevent new sanctions from being imposed, but also to weaken existing ones. We understand how and whom they use in Europe and other parts of the world. We are countering these efforts. I thank everyone who advances the sanctions agenda, despite everything. Because this is the agenda that brings peace closer. One more thing. Today, I received reports on the situation in the Middle East and the Gulf region, following U.S. strikes on facilities linked to the Iranian regime’s nuclear program. A regime that has done so much to bail out Putin. Right now, new waves of "Shahed" drones are in the skies over Ukraine. We all clearly remember where Russia got such weapons. Iran’s decisions to support Russia have brought massive destruction and devastating human losses to our country, and to many others. This truly must stop. And it must absolutely not be reinforced with nuclear weapons. There must be no proliferation of nuclear weapons in the modern world. This must be emphasized. It is important that there is American resolve on this, the resolve of President Trump. It must also be stressed that diplomacy has to start working. Working everywhere: in the Middle East, in the Gulf region, and here in Europe – in Ukraine. If Putin spurns every peace proposal, including those from the United States, it’s hardly surprising that Tehran is also rebuffing them for now. But all of them must feel what real international solidarity means, and that any spread of terror is unacceptable. What is needed is real, lasting security – truly reliable security. Thank you to everyone helping bring it about. Thank you to everyone standing with Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!
