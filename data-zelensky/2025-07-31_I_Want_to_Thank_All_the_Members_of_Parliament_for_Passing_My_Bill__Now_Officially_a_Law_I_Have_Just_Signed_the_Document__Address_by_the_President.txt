Dear Ukrainians! I want to thank all the Members of Parliament right now for passing my bill – now officially a law. I have just signed the document, and its text will be published immediately. This is a guarantee of the proper independent functioning of our state’s anti-corruption bodies and all law enforcement agencies. The law ensures the absence of any external influence or interference, including through polygraph checks – regular checks for all law enforcement personnel who have access to state secrets or have relatives in Russia. This is the right decision. 331 deputies supported it. It passed exactly as needed – both in the first reading and as a whole. It is very important that the state listens to public opinion. That it hears its citizens. Ukraine is a democracy – without any doubt. Government officials will also promptly inform Ukraine’s international partners about this law. And today, there are other very important decisions as well. One is a law that ensures proper budget funding for the Defense Forces for weapons, for drones, and for payments to our warriors and the families of our warriors. This is extremely important. I have just signed it as well, and this guarantees that our warriors on the frontline will receive their payments, and that all proper payments will be made to the families of our fallen heroes. I also instructed, and we agreed with the military command, on the decision to grant an additional 15 days of leave for our military personnel. This is to be implemented in August. Additionally, a law has been adopted that grants more opportunities for veteran-run businesses. These laws are now in place and will already start working. So this day is really productive and tangible for our people. I thank everyone who defends Ukraine, Ukrainians, and Ukrainian national interests. Glory to Ukraine!
