I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! Today, there is a new decision by the United States to support Ukraine – a new defense package worth $400 million. Additionally, a separate package is being prepared for funding the production of Ukrainian drones, amounting to $800 million. Ukraine is grateful for this support. We need to ensure that, despite any political threats in the world, Ukraine can consistently defend its sovereignty and independence. This will certainly be ensured. Every meeting with our partners involves discussions about the defense-industrial complex. Today, I also spoke with U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin about the implementation of our Victory Plan and the concrete steps that can bring the plan’s points to life. We need decisive actions from our partners, especially in light of reports about North Korea's new role in supporting Russia. It is obvious that Putin fears peace, which is why he is looking for ways to escalate the aggression and involve North Korea on the frontline. This is an obvious signal to the whole world as to who wants nothing but war. In this situation, I am grateful to every leader and every nation that is now increasing support for Ukraine, that has backed the first, inaugural Peace Summit, and is helping us prepare the second Summit as well. Prepare it in such a way that it will be truly effective. More than 100 countries and international organizations were with us at the first Peace Summit. All the principles for restoring peace that we proposed are fully based on the UN Charter and key international documents. Back in June, when 100 participants gathered to support peace for Ukraine and the full effectiveness of the UN Charter, there was a real sense of equality among all nations at the table. There was genuine respect for international law. This is exactly what the second Peace Summit should be like. Today, I also held important meetings with Commander-in-Chief Syrskyi, Chief of the General Staff Barhylevych, and Ukraine’s Minister of Defense Umerov. We thoroughly discussed the situation on the frontline, in the main directions – Toretsk, Pokrovsk, Kurakhove, Kharkiv, and others. The reports covered not only the current situation and our current actions but also future prospects. Accordingly, we discussed provisioning, armament, and brigade staffing. We also specifically discussed the Kursk operation – we are holding our positions, and I thank every warrior for their bravery. We must remember that the Kursk operation serves a strategic goal. The war must return to the territories from which it came. This is fair when a buffer zone is created on the aggressor’s territory. Moreover, the Kursk operation has enabled Ukraine to step up its efforts regarding prisoner exchanges – to bring our warriors back from Russian captivity. Everyone can see this. I thank all the combat brigades and every unit fighting on the frontline! And one more thing. Today, we held essential preparatory meetings ahead of the National Security and Defense Council session. Many new details emerged. Unfortunately, there have been hundreds of instances of violations at various levels due to the dishonest work of the Medical and Social Expert Commissions. There will be systemic, personnel, and procedural responses to address this. Glory to Ukraine!
