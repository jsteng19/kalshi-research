I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! Just now, I received a report from Head of the Security Service of Ukraine Vasyl Maliuk – a brilliant operation was carried out. It took place on enemy territory and was aimed exclusively at military targets – specifically, the equipment used in strikes against Ukraine. Russia suffered truly significant losses – entirely justified and deserved. I thank the Security Service, General Maliuk personally, as well as everyone who was involved in the operation. The preparation took over a year and a half. Planning, organization, every detail was perfectly executed. I can say with certainty that this is an absolutely unique operation. What’s most interesting – and this can now be stated publicly – is that the “office” of our operation on Russian territory was located directly next to FSB headquarters in one of their regions. In total, 117 drones were used in the operation – with a corresponding number of drone operators involved. 34% of the strategic cruise missile carriers stationed at air bases were hit. Our personnel operated across multiple Russian regions – in three different time zones. And the people who assisted us were withdrawn from Russian territory before the operation, they are now safe. It is genuinely satisfying when something I authorized a year and six months ago comes to fruition and deprives Russians of over forty units of strategic aviation. We will continue this work. Even before this operation was carried out, we had intelligence indicating that Russia was preparing another massive strike. And it is very important for all our people not to ignore the air raid alerts. Last night, there were nearly 500 Russian drones, attack drones. Each week, they have been increasing the number of units used per strike. Now, they have also prepared Kalibr missiles launched from naval carriers. We know exactly who we are dealing with. And we will defend ourselves by all means available to us – to Ukraine and the Ukrainian people. Not for a single second did we want this war. We offered the Russians a ceasefire. Since March 11, the U.S. proposal for a full and unconditional ceasefire has been on the table. It was the Russians who chose to continue the war – even under conditions where the entire world is calling for an end to the killing. And pressure is truly needed – pressure on Russia that should bring it back to reality. Pressure through sanctions. Pressure from our forces. Pressure through diplomacy. All of it must work together. Today, I held an extended meeting with the Minister of Defense of Ukraine, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, the Head of my Office, the heads of our intelligence agencies, and military leadership. We discussed our expectations for the meeting in Istanbul on Monday. We continue to propose a full and unconditional ceasefire, along with all dignified and rational steps that could lead to a lasting and reliable peace. The Ukrainian proposal we presented to the Russians is logical and realistic. The Russians have not shared their “memorandum” with anyone – we don't have it, the Turkish side doesn't have it, and the American side doesn't have the Russian document either. Despite this, we will attempt to achieve at least some progress on the path toward peace. Today, I also received a report from Commander-in-Chief Syrskyi – on the situation at the front and on our Kursk operation. I am grateful to all our units. Resilience on the ground is just as important as our operations on enemy territory – operations that truly inspire. And one more thing. Today, the Russians launched a missile strike on a military training facility in the Dnipro region. Unfortunately, there are casualties. Our servicemen were killed. My condolences to all their families and friends. This is not the first such attack when Ukraine loses people. I have scheduled a meeting – with the participation of, among others, Mykhailo Drapatyi, Andrii Hnatov, Oleksandr Syrskyi, and Defense Minister Umerov upon his return from the negotiations in Istanbul – to address this issue in detail. All our fighters are needed on the front line – defending Ukraine. Every one of them. And every life must be protected. All necessary decisions to that end will be made. I thank everyone who is helping. I thank everyone who stands with Ukraine. Glory to Ukraine!
