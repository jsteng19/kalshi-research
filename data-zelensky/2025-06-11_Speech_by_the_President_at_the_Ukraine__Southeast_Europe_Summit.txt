Welcome everybody! So, dear colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, dear friends, I sincerely thank each of you for being here today in Odesa. And thank you that we started your visit to our summit from a very heroic place where we can see our heroic people and our patriots from Odesa. Thank you very much for this moment. Odesa is a very important city for all of us and not just a symbol of southern Ukraine; it's a crossroads between Northern and Southern Europe, between the Balkans and the Caucasus, and between European stability and the threats to undermine it. Odesa has always been a gateway and today stands as a gateway to our shared security. The security of Southeastern Europe and the Black Sea is indivisible. And this has been obvious to Ukraine since 2014 and became clear to the entire continent in 2022. Yet, even today, we are compelled to fight not only for our country but to ensure this reality becomes the cornerstone of a new regional policy. And I am pleased to welcome the following leaders here today in Odesa: Presidents of Moldova, Maia Sandu; Montenegro, Jakov Milatović; Romania, Nicușor Dan; Serbia, Aleksandar Vučić; Prime Ministers of Bulgaria, Rossen Jeliazkov; Croatia, Andrej Plenković; and the Hellenic Republic, Kyriakos Mitsotakis; and the Speaker of the Parliament of Albania, Elisa Spiropali; and First Deputy President of the Government and Minister of Environment and Physical Planning of North Macedonia, Izet Mexhiti; and Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign and European Affairs of Slovenia, Tanja Fajon. Our today's agenda will cover the following issues: regional security, resilience to hybrid threats, bolstering trade and transport networks, energy security, demining, post-war reconstruction, rehabilitation, health improvement, and support of military personnel, children and veterans. Dear friends, dear leaders, I'm glad to welcome you to our very beautiful city, to Odesa, again, and we continue our regular meetings with the countries of Southeastern Europe. Sadly, our region is one of Russia’s main targets – main targets for causing chaos. We’ve seen this before – across the Balkans, where Russia fueled ethnic tensions, sabotage, and even coup attempts. We’ve witnessed attempts to manipulate public opinion in Romania, with Moscow’s involvement. And for three decades now, Russia has tried to keep Moldova in poverty and instability, to bring it fully under its control. If Europe loses in Moldova this year, it will embolden Russia to interfere even more in your countries – taking from you your resources, your sovereignty, even your history. That’s why supporting a European Moldova – not pro-Russian or oligarchic forces – is a critical task for all of us. And the same goes for Ukraine. Moscow doesn’t see Ukraine as a country, just as a pile of resources and a military staging ground for its next invasions. We all in the region are dealing with the same source of destruction. Today, I suggest we focus – and especially I will focus – on three things: defense, unity, and real development. You can all see – Putin does not want to end this war. He believes that as long as he can fight and dominate his neighbors, he stays politically alive. But no matter what he believes, our job is to force Russia into a position where they must seek peace and political survival by non-military means. This is absolutely possible. Defense support for Ukraine. We need it to protect our cities and villages from Russian attacks, and to make Russia feel the real cost of war at home. Air defense systems and drones are crucial. Another key tool is, of course, sanctions. Your support for joint EU sanctions decisions is vital. The EU announced its 18th sanctions package. It can be stronger, especially in targeting Russian oil tankers and its financial sector. And on the oil price cap – a cap of $45 is better than $60. Anyway, it's understandable. It’s true. But real peace comes with a $30 cap – that’s the level that will truly change thinking in Moscow. Next point. We all share the same interest in EU enlargement and the strength of NATO. The EU gives Europe the power to compete globally. Without it, European nations could be overwhelmed by other big global players. That’s why we must support each other – those of you moving toward the EU, and Ukraine in its membership talks. This year, Ukraine needs a clear decision on the negotiating clusters. We’ve met every condition. Blocking progress now only wastes time for all of Europe. All our nations count and deserve fair enlargement. The same applies to NATO. Yes, Europe has to do more for its own defense. But everyone in the United States should remember – twice before, destabilization in Europe dragged American soldiers into devastating wars. That’s why it’s so important for America to stay engaged in European security. NATO holds the security structure of Europe together. And every European country has the right to choose its own security path. The upcoming NATO Summit must confirm that. Just as the EU and NATO are essential, so is our cooperation in infrastructure. Transport routes, energy, communications, digital systems – we need to show people clear annual progress in all these areas. Russia’s war and its blockade of Ukrainian ports showed us how vital alternative routes through neighboring countries are. We already have those alternatives thanks to you, of course, dear guests. And every country should have the same readiness for any crisis. And finally, again, we're here in our beautiful city, in Odesa. This beautiful city is a target for Russia. It wants to destroy it like it did countless cities and villages in occupied territories. Russian war plans point to this region – Odesa, and then toward the borders with Moldova and Romania. Of course, we need protection now. But even more, we need long-term guarantees that this can never happen again. That’s why I’m asking all of you to treat security guarantees after this war as a practical need. From air defense to cyber threats – we need real tools for deterrence and rapid response. Let’s look at our agreements, armies, and infrastructure – and strengthen everything that keeps our nations safe. Thank you again for coming. Thank you very much.
