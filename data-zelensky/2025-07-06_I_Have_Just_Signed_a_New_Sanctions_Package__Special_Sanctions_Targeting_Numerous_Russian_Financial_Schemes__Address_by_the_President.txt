I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! I have just signed a new sanctions package – and these are special sanctions targeting numerous Russian financial schemes, particularly cryptocurrency-related ones. The sanctions were introduced at the initiative of the National Bank of Ukraine. This is both a synchronization with our partners and our own initiative. Just through one single company, now included in the sanctions list, and only since the beginning of this year, that is, prior to the sanctions being imposed, the Russians funneled several billion dollars, primarily for the needs of their military-industrial complex. Of course, we will shut down all such schemes. Right now, with many of Russia’s traditional financial channels blocked, they are increasingly shifting to cryptocurrency transactions. Today’s package includes sanctions against 60 legal entities, and for each of them, we will work with our partners to synchronize sanctions – Ukrainian and European, Ukrainian and from other key global jurisdictions. The package also includes 73 individuals – all citizens of Russia. We will also synchronize sanctions against them. It’s a challenging task – sanctioning regulations vary around the world – but we all share a common goal: to compel Russia to stop the war and to severely restrict its capabilities. Sanctions are already depriving Russia of its future, and they must significantly complicate the daily functioning of the Russian system. Next week, we are also preparing new Ukrainian decisions on synchronization with EU sanctions – every European sanctions package against Russia must be implemented in Ukrainian jurisdiction. Just as our Ukrainian sanctions must be implemented in EU jurisdiction. One more important point. Today’s reports – primarily from Commander-in-Chief Syrskyi – on the frontlines. The Pokrovsk direction, where the highest number of assaults took place over the past 24 hours, along with other areas in the Donetsk region, Sumy and Kharkiv regions. Defense against Russian long-range strikes, and our own long-range operations. I am grateful to every Ukrainian warrior for their precision and for the ability to reach even very remote areas in Russia. The joint efforts of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the Security Service of Ukraine, and our intelligence agencies – everything that enhances Ukraine’s long-range capabilities – helps us bring this war closer to an end. This week, I want to give special recognition to the brigades that have delivered the most significant results on the frontlines. The Pokrovsk direction – first and foremost, the 38th Marine Brigade and the 14th Operational Brigade of the National Guard. Thank you! The Kupyansk direction – the 3rd Assault Brigade. Well done, warriors. In the Kharkiv region – the Southern Slobozhanskyi direction – the warriors of the 92nd Assault Brigade distinguished themselves. The Sumy region – my thanks to all the warriors of the 225th Assault Regiment and the 95th Air Assault Brigade. The Novopavlivka direction – the 37th Marine Brigade and the paratroopers of the 79th. Thank you! And special thanks for their results to the 1st and 425th Assault Regiments. Thank you to everyone who defends our state and works to make Ukraine’s defense possible. Today, on Ukrainian Navy Day, I also met with our Navy warriors and presented state awards to the best among them. We are proud of our people! We are also preparing new decisions and new agreements with partners that will make Ukraine stronger – both in defense and in recovery. Much of the coming week will be dedicated to Ukraine’s recovery – to new agreements with partners, and, in many ways, to restoring justice. Glory to Ukraine!
