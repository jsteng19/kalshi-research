Thank you so much! Dear President Biden, Dear leaders, dear our friends, I’m grateful to all of you for your unity in protecting lives. We previously gathered at the NATO Summit in Vilnius to strengthen our defense cooperation. We do value the G7 security declaration and the 26 bilateral security agreements, which fortify us all. And now, more than 30 countries and the EU have agreed to the declaration, truly strong declaration focused on rebuilding Ukraine after the hostilities. This is a shared commitment to help rebuild Ukraine and support our path to the EU. It involves coordinating recovery efforts through the Ukrainian Donor Platform, ensuring that our joint ideas become a reality. And it’s crucial that this support becomes tangible this year. That’s why additional financial resources are planned by the end of the year, with access to $50 billion in immobilized assets from the aggressor state – Russia, which brought this war upon us. This reflects our shared vision of life – we protect people, and we ensure that people have the opportunities to live. And it is absolutely justified that those who help us withstand now will be the first to benefit together with Ukraine from the large-scale reconstruction. Security and prosperity are tightly intertwined, and one cannot exist without the other. Sadly, throughout history, wars have too often shattered the destinies of generations – lasting a few years but poisoning lives for decades. Together, we can prevent this now. We must not leave behind ruins that would spread resentment and bitterness after this war. This task can only be achieved together. After the devastating Second World War, the Allies launched the Marshall Plan, which gave peace the strength to become truly lasting. Today, we are laying the foundation for a similar architecture of recovery – one that will promote peace for Ukraine and all of Europe and the general welfare. I thank President Biden and all you, friends, and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni for their support in organizing today’s meeting and for their unwavering leadership in protecting our lives. Thank you all, my friends! I am confident – life will prevail. Thank you!
