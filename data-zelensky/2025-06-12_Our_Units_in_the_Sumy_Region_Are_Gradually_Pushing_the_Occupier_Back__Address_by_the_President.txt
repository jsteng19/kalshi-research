I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! Today, we continued bringing our people back from Russian captivity. This is already the third stage of the exchanges agreed upon in Istanbul. Among those who have now been returned are guys who had been in captivity since 2022. There are also those who had been considered missing in action. It is important to check every name, all available information. And that’s exactly what we’re doing. I’m grateful to everyone who helps bring our people back. Just now, Defense Minister Umerov delivered a report – we discussed certain details of the overall negotiation efforts with him. We also discussed issues related to financing our defense and defense production in Ukraine. Every single day, both in Ukraine and together with our partners, we focus on ensuring our defense – on everything that provides protection for our state and our people, both here and now, and in the long term. Today, Commander-in-Chief Syrskyi delivered a report – the front line, first and foremost the Pokrovsk direction, the Kursk operation, the border areas of the Sumy region. Our units in the Sumy region are gradually pushing the occupier back. Thank you! I thank every one of our soldiers, sergeants, and officers for this result. Every unit. We are also preparing for upcoming international meetings in the next few weeks. A clear task has been set for all levels of our representatives: it is essential that our partners understand that sanctions against Russia truly work. They truly work when they stay ahead of the Russian authorities’ attempts to adapt to these sanctions. Sanctions on oil. Sanctions on Russian banks and the entire financial sector. Sanctions on individuals and legal entities that help Russia adapt to global pressure. There must be a clear limit to Russia’s ability to adapt – pressure they cannot withstand. That will mark the turning point in the war, beyond which a reliable peace is possible. Today, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius visited Kyiv. Our discussions focused specifically on what can strengthen Ukraine’s positions and provide greater protection for our cities and our Ukrainian communities. I am grateful to Germany – to Chancellor Merz, Minister Pistorius, the entire German political class, and to the society that understands what is at stake and remains willing to continue providing assistance. Germany is one of the leaders in providing support. We appreciate the fact that when Germany makes a promise, it is actually fulfilled. Thank you to everyone who stands with us, stands with Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!
