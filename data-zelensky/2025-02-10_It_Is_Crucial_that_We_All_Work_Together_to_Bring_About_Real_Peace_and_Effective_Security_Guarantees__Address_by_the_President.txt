I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! Today, several decisions are almost finalized – we’ve already set a clear path to their implementation. First, a meeting was held with the Prime Minister, First Deputy Prime Minister Svyrydenko, and Health Minister Liashko regarding medicine prices. The current prices are absolutely unreasonable. Pharmacy chains and manufacturers must offer more affordable conditions for our people. We are preparing a National Security and Defense Council meeting on this issue – with concrete proposals in the interest of our people to bring prices down. Second, I just had a meeting with the head of the European Investment Bank. This is about supporting Ukraine – another $2 billion for Ukraine – funds for our energy sector, our housing programs, and infrastructure projects. I am grateful for the assistance! Third, we are already actively preparing for negotiations with our partners – both European and American – starting on Wednesday. This includes the Ramstein meeting, meetings in Kyiv, and later, participation in the Munich Security Conference. It is crucial that we all work together to bring about real peace and effective security guarantees: security for people, security for our state, security for economic relations, and, importantly, our resilience in terms of resources – not just for Ukraine but for the entire free world. All of this is being decided right now, by Ukraine and our partners. Peace is always a collective effort. Thank you to everyone standing with Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!
