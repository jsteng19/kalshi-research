I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! Today I held a Staff meeting – Technology Staff. The focus was primarily on our drones and the long-range strikes conducted by Ukrainian drones. We analyzed their recent use: the quality of the strikes, the results of their application, and the most effective drone models. The participants included military and government officials, and, most importantly – our manufacturers of drones and other weapons. We managed to discuss many technical details today. The key point is that we need to enhance our weapons' ability to overcome Russian electronic warfare and air defenses. Of course, we also discussed ways to further increase production: there is still a need for contracts, funding, and investments from our partners. The manufacturers proposed specific technological solutions. In ten days, we will revisit these matters, and we need answers to everything discussed today. Our Ukrainian production of drones and their continuous modernization are a key part of our system of deterrence against Russia, which is crucial for ensuring Ukraine's security in the long term; and this will also become our international advantage – our ability to export security after this war. Even now, there is immense interest from our friends around the world in Ukraine’s developments, our capabilities, and our technological production. In this war, Ukrainians have shown how much drones can do to protect positions and save people’s lives, we have shown the importance of constantly developing the unmanned component. Of course, this will also serve as our economic advantage in relations with other partners. But that’s after the war. For now, we must significantly increase the effectiveness of Ukrainian weapons; and everything achieved for Ukraine’s security today will benefit Ukraine for years and decades to come. At the same time, we continue our work on the diplomatic front – to ensure that all the necessary conditions are swiftly in place to apply pressure on Russia, to achieve real peace. I am awaiting a report from the Ukrainian delegation that worked in Saudi Arabia, and we are preparing new tasks for our diplomacy. We must move toward peace. We must move toward security guarantees. We need to free our people. We are determined to work as quickly as possible with our partners. The key factor is our partners’ ability to ensure Russia’s readiness not to deceive but to genuinely end the war. Right now, Russian strikes have not stopped. Around a hundred “Shahed” drones attack Ukraine each night. Missile strikes are regular, and some of our civilian infrastructure, our ports, have been hit, unfortunately, including in Odesa. Yesterday, a civilian ship was struck there – they were just loading wheat, destined for Algeria. People were killed, citizens of Syria. My condolences. Some people were also wounded, and they received the necessary assistance. Any attempt by Russia to “wriggle out” will be clear evidence to everyone that it is Russia that does not want peace. With the clear conclusions drawn by the world. I thank all those who are helping us defend lives and who are working to ensure reliable security. Now is a time when much is being decided. I thank everyone who is helping. Glory to Ukraine!
