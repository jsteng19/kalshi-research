Dear Ukrainians! The key developments of the day. A meeting of the Military Cabinet was held: with thorough reports from Syrskyi, Hnatov, and Drapatyi. All directions, all parts of the frontline were covered. Our positions, necessary supplies, and staffing. The maximum effort for stabilizing the situation, for our active actions and our active diplomacy. Today I have also discussed with the Minister of Defense of Ukraine our preparations for the upcoming Ramstein meeting, which is scheduled for Friday. Our top priority is air defense – above all, missile defense against ballistic threats. Ukraine needs at the very least ten systems that are sufficiently effective specifically against Russian ballistic missiles, and this is where Patriots are second to none. We have repeatedly raised this issue with the American side and with everyone in Europe who is in a position to help. We are counting on decisions. Just today, there were several air raid alerts across the country due to ballistic missile threats. In some parts of our country, people are virtually living under the constant threat of such attacks. And right now, the world lacks not the systems themselves – but only the political decisions needed to protect lives. The systems do exist. There are even enough Patriots in the world to guarantee protection from Russian terror once and for all. But this requires a political decision – a decision by our partners. The second priority at Ramstein is ensuring continued support throughout this year. Stability and predictability of aid are the things that disappoint the aggressor and actually incite toward diplomacy. We need to eliminate Putin’s temptation — his hope that support for Ukraine will vanish. It won’t. The support will continue. We need that signal, and we need a steady supply of defense assistance. Also today, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine reported on his visit to Kryvyi Rih – the site of a brutal strike against children, civilians, and an ordinary city street. Representatives of 32 states – ambassadors and heads of missions – participated in the visit. I thank each country, and every diplomat, for this expression of support. It is vital that the world sees what is truly happening. And one more thing. The Security Service of Ukraine is conducting initial procedural actions with captured Chinese nationals. They are now in Kyiv. Communicating with investigators. Providing information on how they ended up on the frontline, how they became involved in this international crime, this Russia’s war against Ukraine. We also have information about other citizens of the People's Republic of China serving in the Russian army – with names, surnames, and details of the specific ways in which such soldiers became part of the Russian occupation contingent. We will use diplomatic channels to convey the necessary information to the Chinese side and, of course, to everyone in the world who has heard Beijing say that this war must not be further escalated or expanded. Involving Chinese citizens in this war is definitely fueling a larger problem. And this must be responded to in the most principled way. Reinforcing the occupation contingent while speaking of peace are mutually exclusive things. We also expect our partners to be principled – to be principled in their support of Ukraine. I thank everyone who is truly doing everything to end this war justly with lasting peace. I thank our warriors. Glory to Ukraine!
