Dear Ukrainians! A brief summary of the day. The military – our defense, our positions. I have just received a report from the Commander-in-Chief. We are holding the key directions. And this is crucial. Right now, there is a lot of coordination with leaders, and not only in Europe. Today, I spoke with the President of Poland, Andrzej Duda, and we base our position on the fact that our independence – that of Ukraine and of Poland – is deeply interconnected. The stronger Ukraine’s sovereignty, the safer Poland is. The twentieth century proved this. Now, we must stand together, and I am grateful to Poland for its support. I spoke with the Prime Minister of Croatia. I thanked Andrej for defense assistance and security cooperation. We do a lot together with Croatia, and we exchanged views on our next steps and upcoming events. My next conversation today was with the President of the Czech Republic, and we highly value the principled Czech stance. We discussed the situation in Europe, and everything being done to bring peace closer. Thank you! I also had a conversation today with the Prime Minister of Sweden – a country from a region now facing constant hybrid threats and numerous highly troubling incidents in the Baltic Sea. All of this indicates: we need greater unity, we need greater coordination, and greater cooperation. Today, I also had a substantive discussion with the Prime Minister of Luxembourg about various ideas and proposals in Europe aimed at ensuring peace and security guarantees. The key takeaway – Europe must and can do significantly more to truly achieve peace. And this is possible. We and our partners in Europe have clear proposals, and based on them we can ensure the implementation of the European strategy; and importantly, this should be done together with America. Slovenia – the Prime Minister and I had a very good conversation; and it is essential that every nation in the world and on our continent is heard. I thanked Slovenia for helping us in our defense and for supporting us in common European affairs. Ireland – I spoke today with the Taoiseach about our cooperation in Europe and about current key diplomatic positions. A very warm attitude towards our people, towards our defense. We appreciate this. And of course, we continue working with our partners in key global regions, including Africa. Côte d'Ivoire – I spoke today with the President, and I am grateful for the support of our sovereignty, our territorial integrity, and the position that international affairs require genuine predictability, require true respect for the interests of every nation. Without respect, the world will not survive – given today’s level of weaponry. Therefore, we must work at all levels globally – with all partners, in all regions – to ensure that the international order truly exists and truly aligns with the very meaning of the word “order.” I thank everyone for their support! And one more thing. Today, teams from Ukraine and the U.S. are working on a draft agreement between our governments. This is an agreement that can strengthen our relations, and the key is to work out the details to ensure its effectiveness. I look forward to the outcome – a just result. Glory to Ukraine!
