I wish you good health, fellow Ukrainians! A few updates for today. I held an extended meeting with the military leadership: Commander-in-Chief Syrskyi, Chief of the General Staff Hnatov; Defense Minister Umerov was also present. The agenda included planning our actions, our readiness to respond to Russian strikes, to their threats, and taking preventive measures, which means increasing the production of our drones and our missiles. I am grateful to everyone working toward this goal. Hundreds of Ukrainian companies are already producing results for Ukraine’s Defense Forces, with more to follow – I’m certain of that. We are now fully mobilizing our entrepreneurial capacity for weapons production. We are also preparing new agreements with our European partners in the near future, to attract investment into Ukrainian production. First and foremost, this means the production of unmanned systems and long-range capabilities – everything that allows us to maintain control on the front lines, protect the lives of our warriors, and operate at significant distances. Of course, we cannot publicly disclose our existing plans and our capabilities, but the prospect is clear: to respond symmetrically to all Russian threats and challenges. They in Russia must clearly feel the consequences of what they are doing against Ukraine. And they will. Attack drones, interceptors, cruise missiles, Ukrainian ballistic systems – these are the key elements. We must manufacture all of them. I was also briefed today by Government officials on our country’s economic prospects, the decisions needed to ensure the operation of enterprises in Ukraine – those that already exist, as well as the establishment of new businesses. We are working in detail on practical changes to attract capital to Ukraine and to enable the most mutually beneficial cooperation with partners for investment and Ukraine’s recovery. A normal social life in Ukraine, the development of our infrastructure, our communities, Ukrainian healthcare, and our educational opportunities – everything that sustains people’s lives – is only possible with real and tangible economic growth. This is a key task for the Government. And one more thing. Today, for the first time in May, we celebrate the professional holiday of the personnel of our Special Operations Forces. This is one of the most effective components of our Ukrainian defense. Truly awesome guys. Today, I had the honor of personally thanking them, presenting awards to some and handing over Orders of the Golden Star to the families of fallen Heroes. We must never forget the kind of people who have stood up to defend Ukraine and who are truly keeping it alive. Everyone who has fought and continues to fight for Ukraine, everyone who works for our state and for our people – all deserve our deepest gratitude. Independence is upheld by those who fight for it and strengthen it. Glory to Ukraine!
