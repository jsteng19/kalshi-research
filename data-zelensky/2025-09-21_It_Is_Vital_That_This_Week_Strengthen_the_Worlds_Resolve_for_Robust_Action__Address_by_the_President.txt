I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! We are now preparing for a very intense week – a week of diplomacy. We can accomplish a lot if our partners hear us and support proposals that truly bring the end of the war closer. It will be the week of the UN General Assembly – with various events and meetings. The schedule already includes nearly two dozen meetings with leaders from different countries, from all parts of the world – with everyone who has long supported Ukraine and those who are among our new partners. The first meetings are already tomorrow. We are also planning a meeting with the President of the United States this week. There will be an important event on the return of Ukrainian children abducted by Russia – a truly global summit on this issue. It is vital that this week strengthen the world’s resolve for robust action – for without strength, peace will not prevail. The European Union has already agreed in principle on the 19th package of sanctions against Russia, and we expect its swift adoption. In recent weeks, other countries – from Japan and Australia to the United Kingdom – have also imposed sanctions. Pressure on Russia’s oil fleet, on Russia’s energy trade. Pressure on all of Russia’s sanction-evasion schemes – including through cryptocurrency. I thank Europe for this pressure. I am confident: there must be a step from the United States. Putin must believe that the United States does care, and that strong action will follow. I want to thank both the United States and all our partners for the effectiveness of the PURL initiative – our new initiative that enables the purchase of American weapons using funds from NATO partners. This includes missiles for Patriot systems, for HIMARS, and other weaponry – all very effective. In October, we expect to provide additional funding for this initiative. We also have our first proposals for partners regarding the export of Ukrainian weapons – modern ones; this will be a controlled export of our weapons, including naval drones. The security of sea routes is an integral part of overall security, and it depends on many nations. Ukraine is offering all its reliable partners our technologies that have already helped us in the Black Sea. We look forward to robust contracts. We are also preparing new long-term steps for Ukraine’s financial stability – and this concerns, first and foremost, Russian assets. Russian assets must work more for defending against Russian aggression and for rebuilding our country. We will discuss this with our partners as well. Today, there were already several reports from Commander-in-Chief Syrskyi: the border areas, the front, and our counteroffensive operation in the area of Dobropillia and Pokrovsk. I want to thank all our warriors, I want to thank every unit for their results and for the truly strong defense of our state and our independence. Next week must further strengthen both our diplomatic positions and our army – this is essential. Glory to Ukraine!
