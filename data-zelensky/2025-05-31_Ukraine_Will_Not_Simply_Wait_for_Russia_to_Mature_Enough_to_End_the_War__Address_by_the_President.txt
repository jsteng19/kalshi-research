I wish you good health, fellow Ukrainians, We are now preparing for new diplomatic steps together with our partners in Europe and, importantly, with our partners in the United States. In fact, we are in contact almost daily with everyone who can make diplomacy meaningful. As of now, there is no clear information about what exactly the Russians plan to bring to Istanbul. We don’t have it, Türkiye doesn’t have it, the United States doesn’t have it either, and neither do other partners. And at this point, it looks far from serious. We discussed this yesterday with President Erdoğan of Türkiye. Of course, everyone in the world wants diplomacy to work and for an actual ceasefire to take place. Everyone wants Russia to stop playing games with diplomacy and end the war. Everyone wants a serious peace — and Russia must agree to that. That should be the agenda of the meetings. We have already presented our agenda. We hope the American side will be decisive on the issue of sanctions to help bring peace closer. For now, however, we are only seeing new Russian strikes and new Russian assaults. Today, Commander-in-Chief Syrskyi delivered a report. The situation at the front remains complicated — in some directions, we are detecting increased Russian activity. The fiercest battles are taking place in the Pokrovsk, Lyman, and Kupyansk directions. We are also continuing our Kursk operation, which prevents a significant number of Russian troops from operating on Ukrainian territory. The war must be pushed back onto Russian territory — back to where it came from. I want to thank our warriors today for their resilience, and I want to thank everyone for their precision. Looking at this week’s results, I will give special recognition primarily to the assault regiments operating in the Kursk region. These are the 33rd, 225th, and 425th Separate Assault Regiments. Also among the best in this direction is the 103rd Separate Territorial Defense Brigade. Thank you! In the Pokrovsk direction, the warriors of the 1st Assault Regiment are performing especially effectively, and in the Toretsk direction, the 100th Separate Mechanized Brigade has achieved good results. Well done! And of course, the 82nd Bukovynska Separate Air Assault Brigade. Thank you, guys! We are working very actively to guarantee that our Defense Forces are fully equipped with everything they need. Weapons — both production and supplies, financial support, training — for every need, we are developing new agreements with our partners. Special thanks this week to Sweden: we are making active progress within the announced aid packages. Germany: we have very good agreements on investment in our Ukrainian weapons production. The Netherlands is working on supplying F-16s. The United Kingdom is directing proceeds from frozen Russian assets specifically for weapons and equipment repairs for Ukraine. Altogether, this amounts to billions of dollars strengthening the defense of our state and strengthening our people. Next week, we are preparing agreements with the Baltic and Nordic countries. We are also filling out the agendas for our summits — the G7 and NATO summits, which will take place soon. We are also actively engaging with everyone who can toughen sanctions against Russia and who supports such very important decisions. Ukraine will not simply wait for Russia to mature enough to end the war. We are doing everything to ensure that Russia is effectively forced into peace. I thank everyone who is helping us! I am proud of our people! Glory to Ukraine!
