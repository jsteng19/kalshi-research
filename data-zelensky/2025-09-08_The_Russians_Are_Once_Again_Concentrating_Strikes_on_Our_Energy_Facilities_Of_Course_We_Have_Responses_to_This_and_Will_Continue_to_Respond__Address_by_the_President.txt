I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! Today, I held a Staff meeting – focused primarily on technological issues. The stock of air defense systems and missiles for them, the production schedule, the delivery schedule. The protection of Ukraine’s critical infrastructure – above all, the energy sector. The Russians are once again concentrating strikes on our energy facilities. Of course, we have responses to this and will continue to respond, but the main priority is the stability of the system. There were reports on our drone production – their quality and production volumes. I am grateful to all the manufacturers who are ramping up supplies, including long-range weapons. There were also reports from the military today – on the frontline and the supply for our forces. The greatest attention is paid to the Donetsk, Kharkiv, and Zaporizhzhia regions. Constant Russian strikes continue against Kherson. Intense active combat also continues in the border areas of the Sumy region. I am grateful to each of our units for their resilience and for destroying the occupier. Based on the results of the week, it is worth especially recognizing the warriors of the 79th and 82nd Air Assault Brigades, the 92nd Separate Assault Brigade, the 5th Separate Assault Brigade, the 14th Operational Brigade, as well as the 1st, 33rd, 214th, 225th, and 425th Separate Assault Regiments. I am grateful to everyone – to every unit. Earlier, I had a thorough discussion with Ukraine’s Minister of Defense Denys Shmyhal. A long meeting was held on the details of preparations for this fall and winter, as well as the budget for next year. In the coming days, the Minister will take part in the Ramstein meeting – we have defined the key objectives. Strengthening air defense is the number one goal for this Ramstein and for our contacts in Europe and the United States in general. Together with the Minister, we also set priorities for 2026 – both in terms of the essential assets needed by the Defense Forces and in terms of funding. There is a great deal of work ahead with our partners, and in this work we must all be equally effective – every state institution, everyone in contact with our friends around the world, everyone working for defense. The Ukrainian army must be – and will be – consistently strong. At today’s Staff meeting, there were also reports on Ukraine’s communications infrastructure – mobile communication and network protection. It is essential that all our communities have proper access to communication, and the relevant agencies still have work to do in this regard. And one more thing for today. I held a meeting with Prime Minister of Ukraine Yuliia Svyrydenko and Minister of Social Policy Denys Uliutin on fulfilling social obligations and preparing for next year within the framework of budgetary capabilities. It is important that the state fulfills its obligations, ensures all necessary payments, and will continue to do so in the future. This is also one of the proofs of Ukraine’s resilience and effectiveness – even in the time of full-scale war, Ukraine maintains its social system and continues making payments. I thank everyone who helps the state in this work. I thank everyone who pays taxes, preserves jobs, and helps ensure both our defense and support for Ukrainians. Glory to Ukraine!
