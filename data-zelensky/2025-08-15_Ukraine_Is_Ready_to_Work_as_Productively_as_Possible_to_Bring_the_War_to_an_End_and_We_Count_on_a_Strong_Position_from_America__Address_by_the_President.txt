I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! A brief update for today. Of course, I am receiving reports from our intelligence and diplomats regarding the preparations for the meeting in Alaska. Regarding what Putin is bringing to the table. We are also receiving reports from Ukraine’s regions following Russian strikes. Sumy – a Russian strike on the central market. Dnipro region – strikes on cities and enterprises. Zaporizhzhia, Kherson region, Donetsk region – deliberate Russian strikes. The war continues, and it is precisely because there is neither an order nor even a signal that Moscow is preparing to end this war. On the day of negotiations, they are killing as well. And that speaks volumes. Recently, we’ve discussed with the U.S. and Europeans what can truly work. Everyone needs a just end to the war. Ukraine is ready to work as productively as possible to bring the war to an end, and we count on a strong position from America. Everything will depend on this – the Russians factor in American strength. Make no mistake – strength. We continue coordinating with our partners in Europe – I spoke with French President Macron today. The team is also in contact. The time difference with Alaska is eleven hours, so tomorrow will start early for everyone in Europe. We are preparing for the upcoming discussions. Russia must end the war that it itself started and has been dragging out for years. The killings must stop. A meeting of leaders is needed – at the very least, Ukraine, America, and the Russian side – and it is precisely in such a format that effective decisions are possible. Security guarantees are needed. Lasting peace is very much needed. Everyone knows the key objectives. I want to thank everyone who is helping to achieve real results. I held a Staff meeting – both on the current situation at the front and on providing for our army. And also on the long term plans – there must be a contract army, and the transition to this must begin now. The Commander-in-Chief reported on our active operations in all sectors, especially Pokrovsk and Zaporizhzhia. Ukrainian warriors are clearing positions in the Dobropillia area of the occupier, and this is important. There are results. Russia's intention was to demonstrate strength ahead of Alaska, but in fact, for the occupier, this ends with its destruction. I thank our 79th and 82nd Air Assault Brigades, which are fighting there, in the Dobropillia sector. The 2nd Battalion of the 92nd Separate Assault Brigade. Thank you, guys. The 14th Operational Brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine, thank you to the fighters of Azov, also the 32nd Separate Mechanized Brigade, and the 38th Marine Brigade – they are defending positions there, in the Donetsk region. I am grateful to all of you! Gratitude also to the 1st and 425th Assault Regiments. I want to commend our warriors in the Sumy region – first and foremost, the 95th Brigade and the 225th Assault Regiment. Thank you! Today, I held a meeting with our diplomats – the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Office team. We are counting on parliamentary diplomacy – today, I thanked the Chairman of the Parliament, Ruslan Stefanchuk, for his active engagement. Now we need to update our foreign policy plan for the coming months. I instructed that an audit be carried out of our work with partners within the framework of the defense coalitions, the resilience coalitions – all of our agreements. Everything must work. I also instructed that specific individuals be designated as responsible for steps in our key areas: if there is a specific project with partners, there must be a specific person responsible for the success of that project. On Monday, I expect a report from the Government on the updated plan of foreign policy steps. I thank everyone who stands with us, with our people, with Ukraine! I thank all those working for the independence of our state and for our strong positions. Glory to Ukraine!
