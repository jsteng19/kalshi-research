Dear Ukrainians! Today, air raid sirens across Ukraine have sounded almost the entire day. Overnight, there was yet another Russian attack with missiles and drones – ballistic strikes and more than 140 attack drones in a single night. It was loud in Kyiv and in other cities. Tragically, there are wounded. Tragically, there are killed. My condolences to all the families and loved ones. Rescue efforts continue all day in Kharkiv, Sumy, and the capital. I am grateful to all our people who save and help every day. Each mobile fire group, all interceptor drone crews, each air defense unit, our combat aviation – I thank you for your effective duty shifts. Each week, we work to make our Ukrainian skies more protected, and these weeks are no exception. Work continues with our partners, so we can not only receive new air defense systems and missiles for them but also localize the production of the necessary systems and missiles in Ukraine. This is one of the strategic decisions needed. And not just for our country, but for overall security in Europe – the protection of Ukraine’s sky is one of the foundations of the future security architecture. And it is entirely fair that the Russian sky – the sky of the aggressor – is not calm either today. Our proposal for a halt to the strikes, for a ceasefire of at least 30 days, still stands – we are not withdrawing this proposal, as it offers a real chance for diplomacy. But it is Russia that the world sees giving no answer – no response except for new strikes. This clearly and obviously shows who is the source of this war. Russia must end its aggression – and it will have to. The only question is time. War is a loss for everyone, including the aggressor. Sanctions against Russia for this war will increase – and these are significant sanctions. Global justice will also work – in many respects, unfortunately, slowly, but what’s important, inevitably. And we are preparing updates on this, and we are expediting justice. Today, there was also a report from Commander-in-Chief Syrskyi regarding our active operations in the Kursk and Belgorod regions. We are defending the Ukrainian land from enemy activities along the border. I want to thank every unit, all our soldiers, all our sergeants, and commanders today – thank you all for your resilience and real strength, the strength that Ukraine needs so much. And one more thing. Tomorrow, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine is set to ratify the economic partnership agreement with the United States of America. The agreement is designed to align with Ukraine's national interests. Security and economy always go hand in hand. We need decades of predictable and tangible economic growth. The strategic vision of America is to create new economic partnerships. This will work for Ukraine's defense and for our defense cooperation. Ukraine’s strategic vision is to involve partners in real work here, in Ukraine, to invest here, and develop production on our land. This is exactly what we are doing. It is important that all Members of the Parliament realize the significance of this agreement and support the prospects it opens up. I thank everyone who stands with Ukraine. I thank everyone who is defending our state. Glory to Ukraine!
