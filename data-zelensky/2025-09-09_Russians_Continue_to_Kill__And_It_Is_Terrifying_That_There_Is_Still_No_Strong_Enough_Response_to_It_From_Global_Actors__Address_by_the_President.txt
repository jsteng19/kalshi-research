Dear Ukrainians! Today, the Russians carried out a horrendous strike on the village of Yarova in the Donetsk region – a strike with a guided aerial bomb. The Russians knew full well what they were targeting, and they clearly saw that they were hitting civilians. These were ordinary people who were collecting their pensions. As of now, 24 people have been confirmed killed. My condolences. Another 19 were wounded. All of them are receiving the necessary assistance. And this is only one strike out of many that the Russians launch every day against Ukrainians – against our people, against our state. Russians continue to kill – and it is terrifying that there is still no strong enough response to it from global actors. This is precisely what Putin sees as permission to continue the war – if there is no strong pressure, if there are no decisive actions in response. Russia’s economy and the Russian state must feel pain every time they kill, every time they strike like this. Ever since this February, the Russians have been rejecting all ceasefire proposals. For weeks, Russia has been unable – and unwilling – to give any concrete response to the United States on a leaders’ meeting format. Russia invests in war, and solely in war. The response must be strength. And we are talking about strengthening our air defense – quicker decisions on systems are needed, Patriots above all. I want to thank everyone who supports us in this. This weekʼs Ramstein meeting must give concrete results on air defense and on funds for the PURL initiative, which enables us to purchase American weapons. September must be productive for this program. I want to thank each country with which we are expanding our bilateral cooperation. Everything that gives us greater ability to protect lives – it all matters. It is also crucial that sanctions against Russia continue to work and get stronger. Our team is working with Europeans, with Americans, with the G7 countries at every level: the Government, the Office team. There is an understanding that without new sanctions, there will be no progress in diplomacy and in all efforts to end this war. And time matters. For far too long, there has been no strengthening of pressure on Russia that would hit the Russian war machine directly, tangibly and without delay – precisely the sectors and industries that fuel aggression. Delayed economic effects do not work – the Russians prove this every time with new strikes. The Russians’ killing of Ukrainians in Yarova today – ordinary civilians, elderly people simply waiting for their pensions – is a crime from any perspective. On such matters – on matters of human life – there is no division between West and East, between liberal democracies or any other systems. For everyone, this is clearly murder. And everyone who has ever said that the war must end should respond to this. China, India, Latin America, Japan, Europe, the Arab countries, the United States, or anyone else at all. I have just spoken with the Prime Minister of Norway – we greatly value his support and appreciate his condolences. I also want to thank António Costa, the European Commissioners, and others who have already spoken. Together, we must find a way to pressure Russia that could become the way toward ending this war. There are no other ways. I thank everyone who has enough resolve. I thank everyone who stands with us, with Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!
