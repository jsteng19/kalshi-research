I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! First.Military. Today, there was a report from Commander-in-Chief Syrskyi and Defense Minister Umerov. The front. Supplies. It is very important that the United States is now increasing deliveries. This is necessary to stabilize the situation. I am grateful to our partners. The pace of deliveries must be such that it disrupts the pace of Russian assaults. We need greater strength of weapons. And strong positions for diplomacy. And every unit, every brigade contributing to this brings us closer to the possibility of a normal peace. I thank our 95th, 80th, and 82nd separate air assault brigades for their resilience and bravery in battles over these weeks. Also, the 68th separate jaeger brigade – well done, guys! My gratitude as well to the 225th and 425th separate assault battalions – thank you! I would also like to highlight all our warriors who are carrying out long-range strikes on Russian territory. We are seeing the right and necessary results in destroying the military infrastructure of the enemy – and only military targets. Ukraine is defending itself from aggression, and our strikes are exclusively directed at military targets. The Armed Forces of Ukraine, the Security Service of Ukraine, the Defense Intelligence, the Foreign Intelligence Service – I am grateful to all involved structures for their precision. Today, much attention was also given to domestic issues – the decisions and innovations needed in the long term to ensure that Ukraine can bring back as many of our people as possible who left because of the war. We must create all the necessary economic and social incentives for Ukrainians to work in Ukraine, to work for Ukraine, and to build greater potential for Ukraine to compete equally on the global stage. The Ukrainian people have proven their courage and can demonstrate to the world their ability to recover and rebuild from the ruins. Today, I held a meeting on this matter with Deputy Prime Ministers Chernyshov, Fedorov, and Kuleba, along with the Office team. We are also preparing for talks tomorrow with representatives of Ukrainian businesses – to discuss the systemic solutions needed now and in the future to give Ukraine greater confidence and a strong economic pulse. And the third important point for today. I spoke with the President of Serbia and thanked Aleksandar for supporting our country and our people. We discussed our cooperation – both bilateral and with other partners. I really appreciate our dialog. Maximum constructive relations for Ukraine and joint security with our partners. Glory to Ukraine!
