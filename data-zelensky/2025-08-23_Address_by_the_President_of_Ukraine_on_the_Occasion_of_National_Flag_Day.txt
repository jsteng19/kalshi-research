Glory to Ukraine! Our dear warriors! All Ukrainians! Today is an important day – a day of one of our strongest emotions: the feeling you get when you are at home, or when you recognize your own people and what comes from your homeland. And wherever you are in the world, whichever country you may travel to, when you spot the Ukrainian flag, you realize that the people beside you may be strangers to you personally, but their hearts are unmistakably familiar. Each of us sees the blue-and-yellow flag thousands of times throughout our lives. And it has become so common in our country that wherever you walk through the streets of our cities or any of our communities, you are bound to see our national flag somewhere along the way: on buildings, on flagpoles, behind car windows, or on someone’s backpack. And for people, it matters greatly to express their love for Ukraine in this very way. But when you are constantly surrounded by our symbols, you may sometimes stop seeing them as something truly special. Yet in reality, they are always something special. This very flag embodies a feeling of salvation for those we bring back from Russian captivity. When they see the Ukrainian colors, they understand: the evil is over. This flag is the goal and the dream for many of our people in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine. And they safeguard this flag, they keep it safe, because they know: we will not hand our land to the occupier. This flag represents everything dearest to hundreds of thousands of our warriors – men and women from all over Ukraine, who are defending not just one particular direction, not just Vovchansk or Dobropillia, but all our Ukraine, and who are risking their lives to win the right to life for our entire state. And there is no capital in the world where life is respected and the Ukrainian flag is not – wherever life is truly valued, a partnership with Ukraine is valued as well. Ukraine brings together the best. And it has already established a widely shared belief that only together with Ukraine can guaranteed security for democratic nations be achieved. And may everyone who has contributed to such strength of Ukraine’s colors hear these words today, which are, above all, words of gratitude. They are truly well-deserved. I want to thank everyone today – each and every person who is fighting for our state and our people. We thank all those who are working for Ukraine’s interests and for our independence. I thank everyone who adds their personal strength to the strength of the Ukrainian nation. And we will always remember our heroes of different times, who fought for us, for Ukraine, who fought for their own freedom with our Ukrainian flag in their hands, on their insignia, or simply in their hearts – and who, tragically, gave their lives in battle. We remember them, and we do not forgive the enemy for our losses. Let us now honor with a minute of silence the memory of all our fallen heroes. Thank you. Long live Ukraine! May our blue-and-yellow flag always fly proudly! Happy Flag Day, dear Ukrainians! Glory to Ukraine!
