Dear Ukrainians! A very brief update on today. It was a rocky start to the day, with more than 500 Russian attack drones and missiles. Difficult, but a significant number were shot down. Regrettably, some struck their targets. Interceptor drones demonstrated important performance today. Dozens of Shaheds were taken down specifically by interceptors. We are scaling this up to the hilt: increasing production of such types of drones – the interceptor ones – and expanding training and preparation for our drone operators. The mission is clear. Today, I also spoke with President Trump. It was an important conversation. We agreed to arrange a meeting between our teams to strengthen air defense capabilities. We had an in-depth discussion about joint production – something both us and the United States need. Today also marks an important decision in Europe, in Denmark: our first agreement on weapons production for us in Europe, coproduction between Ukraine and Denmark. This is paramount both in terms of security and investment. Also today, I extended my greetings to our Ukrainian police officers on Ukraine’s National Police Day. I congratulated the guys and presented them with state awards, including the titles of Hero of Ukraine for four officers – sadly, one of them posthumously. Police units, alongside all our Defense Forces, are fighting on the frontlines. And today, there was also another exchange. Our warriors returned home from Russian captivity. We are preparing further exchanges. I thank everyone who is helping us! Glory to Ukraine!
