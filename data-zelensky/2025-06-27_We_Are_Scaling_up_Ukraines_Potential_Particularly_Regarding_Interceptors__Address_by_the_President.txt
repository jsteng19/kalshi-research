Dear Ukrainians! Today has been a full and busy day. I held a meeting of the Staff – specifically its technological division, the Technology Staff. There were detailed reports on drones, covering all aspects: financing, production, and the necessary regulatory streamlining. The key goal is to maximize production, particularly of the types of drones needed on the frontline and for defending our cities, also taking into account the development of enemy technologies. At the Staff meeting, we heard reports from the military command, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, and the Ministry of Strategic Industries. Our intelligence presented a detailed report on Russia’s technological plans and intentions. We are scaling up Ukraine’s potential, particularly regarding interceptors. I gave several special instructions – I’m not disclosing the details yet, but the outcome must be clear: increased production in Ukraine and for Ukraine. All opportunities must be available – both for businesses and for state manufacturers. The main point is that the scale of our production and the pace of drone development must be fully aligned with the conditions of the war. Today I also held a meeting with our diplomats: the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Deputy Prime Minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration; the team of the Presidential Office was also present. These past weeks have been especially intense with our meetings in Europe and in Canada, at the G7 Summit. There are agreements on defense packages and joint production with the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Canada, and other partners. There are also areas for collaboration with the United States. Many agreements have been reached with France and Germany as well. All of these need to be effectively implemented: from joint drone production and investments to our long-range capability projects, including missile development. Today, there is also a decision to significantly accelerate sanctions pressure on Russia. I want to thank our partners who are already preparing the EU’s 18th sanctions package. New sanction measures have also been introduced by the United Kingdom and Canada. We are coordinating on sanctions with all G7 nations, as well as with other key global jurisdictions. All necessary sanctions imposed by the world against Russia must also be fully enforced within our Ukrainian jurisdiction. Likewise, Ukrainian sanctions against all who support Russia, against those holding or acquiring business assets in the temporarily occupied territories, and effectively sponsoring the occupation – the Ukrainian sanctions against such actors must also be fully enforced in key jurisdictions. Russia’s accountability for this war and our sanctions pressure must be operating at full capacity. They must leave no room for Russia or its cronies to adapt. I thank everyone who is helping. I thank everyone working for Ukraine. Glory to Ukraine!
