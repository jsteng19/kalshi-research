I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! I want to especially thank all our warriors today who are inflicting truly significant losses on Russia. Losses at the front. Losses along the border. Losses on Russia’s own territory thanks to our long-range strikes. The most effective sanctions – the ones that work the fastest – are the fires at Russia’s oil refineries, its terminals, oil depots. We have significantly restricted Russia’s oil industry, and this significantly restricts the war. Russia’s war is essentially a function of oil, of gas, of all its other energy resources. I thank the special forces of the Security Service of Ukraine, who did a great job in Primorsk recently, hitting Russia’s largest oil terminal on the Baltic Sea. There is substantial damage; everything has been verified. And this is tangible for the enemy. Our special forces are also keeping an eye on the port of Ust-Luga and all other Russian points of access to the world market. Today, the Security Service of Ukraine’s drones are capable of operating at distances of more than a thousand kilometres. The Special Operations Forces, the Unmanned Systems Forces, the Foreign Intelligence Service, and the Defense Intelligence are also involved. I thank them all for their accuracy. When there is a result, we praise the result. Russia could have ended this war long ago – and we have proposed this. Partners have proposed this. Many times. Russia has rejected everything related to peace. Accordingly, we are defending ourselves. And it is important that we are constantly expanding the range of weapons we produce and use. Of course, the details are extremely sensitive. But I also want to thank every Ukrainian company that provides us with this strength. We will not name the companies. For now. They already know who will use which weapons. What matters is that we have such companies. What matters is that they're ramping up production. What matters is that, at the state level, we support every such business that enhances Ukraine's defense capabilities and restores justice for us. I also want to acknowledge the producers of our drones, especially interceptor drones – we are increasing volumes, and it is essential that the development of such drones does not stop. A technological war requires constant innovation, and I thank all the engineers, developers, every enterprise, everyone who helps, every one of our volunteers – all who keep our defense at the proper technological level. The defense of Ukraine is truly a common task. And we are ready to teach all partners how to carry out such defense. Everyone can see that the Russians are probing – looking for ways to bring the war onto the territory of Poland and the Baltic states. The Russian army is also testing Romania. Of course, NATO has Patriots, other systems, and powerful fighter jets. But against Russian “shaheds” and “gerberas,” we in Ukraine have much cheaper, more scalable and systemic solutions. It is important not to waste any time. Today, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi delivered a report. There are good results in the border area of the Sumy region. Our units continue to advance toward the state border of Ukraine. I thank the warriors of the 225th Separate Assault Regiment and the 71st Jaeger Brigade. The Russians are also suffering significant losses in the Kharkiv region – in Kupyansk – and in the Donetsk region. We continue our actions in the Dobropillia sector. Importantly, our men are repelling the Russian assaults. Special thanks to the warriors of the 1st, 225th, and 425th Separate Assault Regiments, and to the 79th and 82nd Air Assault Brigades. Well done, guys. We are also acting according to the situation in the Zaporizhzhia region. I thank everyone who is defending our state and our people! I thank everyone who stands with us, who stands with Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!
