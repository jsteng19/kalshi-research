Thank you so much. Thank you very much, dear Roberta, Madam President! Dear ladies and gentlemen, dear friends, our friends, friends of Ukraine! I thank you for supporting Ukraine. Thank you, Roberta, for calling this extraordinary session of the European Parliament to mark 1,000 days of full-scale war. Thank you for ensuring that not a single one of the thousand days of this terrible war became a day of betrayal of our shared European values. We’ve proven that these values are not just words – not something abstract. European values and the European way of life – when transformed into action – protect the lives of real people. Thank you so much. Together – Ukraine, all of Europe, and our partners in America and around the world – we have succeeded not only in preventing Putin from taking Ukraine but also in defending the freedom of all European nations. Even with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un by his side, Putin remains smaller than the united strength of Europe. I urge you not to forget this. Do not forget how much Europe is capable of achieving. If we could stop Europe’s way of life from falling, then we can surely push Russia towards a just peace. Peace is what we desire most. Two years ago, we proposed the Peace Formula, and I am grateful to all of Europe and every partner who has supported it. And you in the European Parliament were among the first to support the Peace Formula. And the only one who opposes it, is the one who started this war – it’s Russia. And we must push Russia toward just peace. Every blow and every threat from Russia must be met with firm sanctions. For a thousand days, it has been crucial to radically reduce Russia’s ability to fund its war through oil sales. Oil is the lifeblood of Putin’s regime. And the shadow fleet of tankers is what keeps it alive. As long as these tankers operate, Putin continues to kill. Strong sanctions are essential. I thank each of you – thank you, Roberta, again – I thank each of you who supports our people – our resilience, our ability to restore safety even after the most devastating mass attacks by Russia. Together, we have accomplished much. But we must not fear doing even more. Now, Putin has brought 11,000 North Korean troops to Ukraine’s border. This contingent may grow to 100,000. While some European leaders think about winning some elections or something like this at Ukraine’s expense, Putin is focused on winning this war. He won’t stop on his own. The more time he has, the worse the conditions become. Every “today” is the best moment to push Russia harder. And it is clear – without certain key factors, Russia will lack real motivation to engage in meaningful negotiations: without fires in its ammunition depots on Russian territory, without disrupted military logistics, without destroyed Russian air bases, without its lost capabilities to produce missiles and drones, and without its assets being confiscated. You know very well that Putin does not value people or rules; he values only money and power – these are the things we must take away from him to restore peace. If anyone in Europe thinks they can sell Moscow Ukraine – or any other country, like the Baltic states, the Balkans, Georgia, or Moldova – and gain something in return, let them remember this simple truth – no one can enjoy calm waters amid a storm. We must do everything to end this war – fairly and justly, as you said, Roberta. And of course, together. Together. A thousand days of war is a tremendous challenge. Tremendous challenge. Ukraine deserves to make the next year the year of peace. Thank you! Thank you again. Thank you so much. Thank you for your resolutions, your decisions, your principles, your visits to Ukraine during the war, during the first year of the war, especially the first year when it was so difficult. And thanks for your faith in Ukraine. Thank you very much. Glory to Ukraine!
