I wish you good health, fellow Ukrainians. A few important updates from today. I have just met with entrepreneurs – members of the American Chamber of Commerce. These are significant businesses. I thanked them for their work in Ukraine and with Ukraine – these are companies that pay taxes in our country and preserve job opportunities. But they are also companies and people with significant influence. It is important for all of us in Ukraine that everyone now uses their personal influence to achieve a collective outcome. Continued U.S. support for Ukraine, for our defense, for our people, is in our shared interest, held by everyone in our country. Air defense for Ukraine is protection for every company operating in our state, holding assets here, and developing their production. Ukraine’s message is absolutely clear: together, we can achieve more. I thank all the companies and entrepreneurs who support Ukrainian defense, who support Ukrainian resilience. Today, we discussed how meaningful it is when companies withdraw from the Russian market and choose to work right here, in Ukraine. We are also establishing a new network of cooperation with the United States and many other countries, based on shared opportunities for developing industry and technological sectors. But of course, security, of course, protection from Russian strikes is the cornerstone. And we expect greater engagement from businesses in promoting this security agenda of ours. Also today, Ukraine’s Minister of Defense and Minister of Foreign Affairs gave their reports, in particular on our relations with the United States. Currently, at the working level, Ukraine and the U.S. are clarifying all the details of the defense support, including the air defense component. One way or another, we must ensure protection for our people. There were also discussions today about the next steps in our relations with the European Union, during this period of Denmark’s six-month Presidency. There was a meeting today with our Government officials and the Office team – we are also working with Denmark and other partners on new agreements for arms production, including joint manufacturing, and we’re also preparing updates on our interceptor drones. I spoke today with the President of Egypt – it was a very important conversation about our bilateral relations and, of course, ways to bring the war closer to an end. Egypt is ready to help. We agreed to activate the work of the Ukraine–Egypt intergovernmental commission and our entire bilateral cooperation. And one more thing. We are also continuing our entirely justified efforts targeting various individuals who have aligned themselves with Russia. Figures with political influence and Russian passports, individuals who work against Ukraine’s independence in all its dimensions, including spiritual independence, anyone who supports or justifies aggression: all these people have no place in Ukraine, and never will. We are adopting the respective decisions. And we are preparing new Ukrainian sanctions – resolutions of the National Security and Defense Council will follow. Glory to Ukraine!
