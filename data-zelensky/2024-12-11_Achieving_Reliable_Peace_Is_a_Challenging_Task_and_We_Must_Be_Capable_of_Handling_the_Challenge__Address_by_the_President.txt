I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! I have just spoken with the Prime Minister of Spain about our joint work – all of us in Europe – to achieve unity, which can bring peace closer. I am grateful to Spain for its support. And especially for the support in strengthening our air defense. We will continue working this week and next to strengthen our shared European positions, ensuring they help restore security in Ukraine and throughout Europe. Coordination and joint work always lead to achieving results. This is what Europe needs now, not some individual efforts in defiance of everyone else on the continent. Achieving reliable peace is a challenging task, and we must be capable of handling the challenge. The European position on peace must be as strong as possible. Today I held several important meetings. Together with Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Sybiha, we are already preparing replacements in the diplomatic corps for the near future. We will present them in a week and a half. We are currently interviewing candidates for the positions of Ukrainian Ambassadors. There are some strong proposals. Today, First Deputy Prime Minister Svyrydenko reported on meetings and negotiations in the United States, as well as on Government programs, including eSupport. Almost six and a half million Ukrainians have already applied for eSupport, including one million six hundred thousand applications for children. The development pace of this program is good, as we expected. It is obvious that people need the program. And the first payments are already being made. We see that about half of the payments were transferred to utilities. A significant part goes to volunteer funds, and it is very important that people can support our army with these funds. The eSupport program will be open for three months of the winter – this is the time to apply for it. And the funds will be available for spending throughout the whole coming year. Today, the Ukrainian-German Business Forum was held in Germany, with Chancellor Scholz and Prime Minister Shmyhal attending. I am waiting for the Prime Minister's report on the agreements reached. And one more thing. Regarding any missile threats. The action algorithm remains the same. If there is a threat and an air raid siren sounds – you have to react. Know where the shelter is. And take care of yourself. I am grateful to all defenders of our skies who protect Ukraine. Glory to our warriors! Glory to our people! Glory to Ukraine!
