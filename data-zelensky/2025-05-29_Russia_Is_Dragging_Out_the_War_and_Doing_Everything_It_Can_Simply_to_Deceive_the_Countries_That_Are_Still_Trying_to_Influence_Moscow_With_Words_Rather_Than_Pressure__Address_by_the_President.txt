I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! Today, I’m already in Kyiv – an active day after the visit to Germany. All the agreements must be implemented as soon as possible. This concerns air defense first and foremost – the top priority – but also investments: investments in our production – weapons production and beyond – as well as all our other joint projects. We highly value cooperation with Germany – this is one of those cases when bilateral relations between our countries help all of our Europe. I want to thank Chancellor Merz personally for the good decisions – more joint production, increased funding, development of IRIS-T capabilities for Ukraine, missiles for Patriot systems – that’s what matters most. Thank you. Today, I held a meeting with Ukraine’s Defense Minister Umerov, Foreign Minister Sybiha, and Head of the Presidential Office Yermak regarding our diplomatic efforts. We maintain daily coordination with our partners and are preparing additional meetings for this week. Today, we had conversations with both American and European partners. It’s important to speak honestly – everyone in the world – especially those who have supported a ceasefire. Russia is dragging out the war and doing everything it can simply to deceive the countries that are still trying to influence Moscow with words rather than pressure. Words do not work with Moscow. Even the so-called “memorandum,” which they promised and allegedly spent over a week preparing – no one has seen it yet. It has not been shared with Ukraine. It has not been shared with our partners. They haven’t even shared the new agenda with Türkiye – the country that hosted the first meeting. Although they promised the exact opposite, and above all, they promised it to the United States, to President Trump. Another Russian deception. They are doing everything to ensure the meetings are meaningless. And that is yet another reason why there should be sufficient sanctions, sufficient pressure on Russia. Today, Commander-in-Chief Syrskyi delivered a report on the frontline and on our long-range activity inside Russian territory. I thank our guys for their precision. And it is only fair – it is in Russia that they must feel what war truly is in order to be willing to engage in diplomacy. And one more thing. Today, I spoke with Ukraine’s Finance Minister Marchenko about Ukraine's long-term financial outlook – ensuring support for the army, maintaining Ukraine’s resilience, and securing budget payments. Stability and predictability for our people are essential. We are working on this together with our partners – including in preparation for the upcoming G7 meetings. Thank you to everyone standing with Ukraine. Thank you to everyone defending our state. Glory to Ukraine!
