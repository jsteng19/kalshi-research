Dear Ukrainians! Today, the search operations at the site of the Russian strike on Kyiv have concluded – a regular residential building, a direct hit. The missile killed 28 people. In total, the city suffered 31 fatalities from that strike, including 5 children. Children born in 2007, 2011, 2014, 2018, and even 2022. My condolences to the families and loved ones. This was one of the most brutal Russian strikes on Kyiv. One hundred fifty-nine people were injured. Ordinary buildings, enterprises, and even one of Kyiv’s mosques were hit. There was no military purpose at all. Many around the world have supported Ukraine, many have condemned Russian terror, their strikes, and their Russian refusal to end the war. Ceasefire proposals have been made long ago – Ukrainian proposals, U.S. proposals, and many others around the world have communicated this to the Russians. Each time, the only response from there has been attempts to gain more time for war, more time for terror. Russia does not operate otherwise. So it is very important that the prospect of new sanctions, strong sanctions, has now begun to put pressure on Russia – and not only against the aggressor state itself. All Russian finances, every scheme that fills the Russian budget, must be targeted by the world. Only this will convince Moscow to genuinely work for peace. Ukraine is grateful to the United States, grateful to Europe, and all our other friends around the world who strive for peace. Ukraine is ready to work as swiftly as possible for the sake of peace. We all clearly understand what steps are needed. We understand who calls the shots in Russia, and thus Ukraine is once again offering to move beyond technical talks – not to exchange statements, but to actually meet at the level of leaders. I want to thank President Trump for his readiness for such a meeting. I am grateful to everyone who has supported this. Russia’s readiness is needed. The Head of the Office, the Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council, and the Minister of Foreign Affairs will continue communication with our partners on this matter. Today, I spoke with the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, including about such diplomatic efforts, about contacts with our partners. I am grateful to the United Kingdom for their readiness to assist. Of course, it is important that we can count on further defense support and political cooperation. There were reports today from our government officials: Yuliia Svyrydenko, the Ministers of Defense, Economy, and Finance. We discussed our work with partners – decisions we are making and financial matters. We are ensuring all aspects of resilience for our country as needed. The Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine reported on the elimination of the aftermath of Russian strikes. Also today, I held a session summarizing the results of a meeting with our people who were released from Russian captivity. That meeting took place on Monday. It was very-very substantive; many issues were raised: post-captivity rehabilitation, guarantee of all rights, restoration of documents, and social reintegration. A very sensitive matter is the return of civilians from captivity. Andriy Yermak reported on decisions already developed by our Coordination Headquarters, those that are already being implemented. A bill is also being drafted that ensures protection and proper recovery after captivity. It concerns illnesses acquired during captivity. Therefore, it is only fair that assistance be equivalent to that provided for illnesses acquired while serving in the Defense Forces. Ihor Klymenko reported on the rehabilitation of former prisoners. Kyrylo Budanov reported on preparations for new exchanges – I hope that all of this will be successful and that we will implement it all. I thank everyone who cares about Ukraine, all who work and all who fight for our state. Glory to Ukraine!
