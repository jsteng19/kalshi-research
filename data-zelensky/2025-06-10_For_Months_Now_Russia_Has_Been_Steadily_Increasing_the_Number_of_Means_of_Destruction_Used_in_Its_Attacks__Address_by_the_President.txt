Dear Ukrainians! Today is another day of exchanges. We brought home our wounded, including those with very severe trauma. These are warriors from various components of our Defense Forces. All of them require serious medical care. We will make sure to provide all the support they need. We expect the exchanges to continue, and, for sure, there will be separate updates on that. The task is to find all of our people in Russian captivity and to free them all. I thank everyone who is helping us in this effort. I also want to thank all political figures, public leaders, and every media professional – everyone who continues to spread information about Russian strikes on our cities and our villages. It is vital that there is no silence in response to Russian escalation – and it is clear that escalation is underway. For months now, Russia has been steadily increasing the number of means of destruction used in its attacks. This is a consistent trend. And it means that Moscow fears no one in the world – no one among those who have called for an end to the killings and for meaningful negotiations on ending the war. Putin wants to continue killing and exploits the lack of a strong response. They don’t listen to Washington. And that says a lot to the world – to everyone. The European Commission has taken an important step by announcing a new sanctions package. I am grateful that this 18th package is focused on Russian energy resources and banks. That is the right direction for pressure. But this package still needs to be filled with strong details. Russia’s ability to continue the war equals its ability to sell oil and circumvent financial restrictions. That is why it is essential to maximally restrict the Russian tanker fleet, their technological capabilities for extraction and processing, and to do everything possible to keep the price of Russian oil below what they can sustain. Each of our partners knows what the necessary price cap is – no more than USD 30. That price level would mean real pressure on Russia – they must be forced to seek peace, as they don’t understand any other incentives. I know that partners are currently discussing a compromise price, but enough compromising with Russia. Every such compromise only delays peace. We call for a real reduction in the price of Russian oil – in other words, a real step toward ending the war. And I especially want to thank those in the United States who are relying specifically on strength, including the strength of diplomacy through sanctions. Today, our military officials delivered their reports. I had a separate discussion with Defense Minister Umerov on our efforts to counter drones, protect against missiles, and reinforce our air defense. The Russians have once again used ballistic missiles from North Korea. We are also tracking evidence that Russian-Iranian drone technologies have spread to North Korea. This is extremely dangerous both for Europe and for East and Southeast Asia. The longer this war continues on our territory, the more warfare technologies evolve, and the greater the threat will be to everyone. This must be addressed now – not when thousands of upgraded “Shahed” drones and ballistic missiles begin to threaten Seoul and Tokyo. And one more thing. Today’s Russian strike damaged ordinary residential buildings in various regions of Ukraine. In Odesa, a maternity hospital was hit. The Odesa Film Studio suffered major damage – decades of history destroyed. In the capital, even Saint Sophia Cathedral was damaged: part of the cathedral's façade collapsed under the blast wave. To all those who truly know history and feel connected to Christianity, even the slightest threat of damage or destruction to Saint Sophia is utterly unacceptable, indeed catastrophic. But not for Russia. Possessed maniacs with their “Shaheds” and the red button. Catastrophe is the very purpose of their existence. They produce nothing else – and will leave nothing behind. This must be addressed. They must be stopped. And it is not only we in Ukraine that need this – the whole world will benefit when Russia is forced into peace. I thank everyone who stands with Ukraine. Glory to Ukraine!
