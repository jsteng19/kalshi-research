I’ve just spoken with President Trump. It was a good conversation – very warm and constructive. We congratulated each other and our nations on Victory Day in World War II: 80 years since the victory over Nazism – the victory in Europe, achieved together by all the nations that defeated Nazism. It is very important that this shared victory and the joint efforts of the Allies became the foundation for peace and international law – for a normal life for many nations. Now, this life must be protected and restored – rebuilt from the ruins after Russian strikes. Just as before, we must work together to bring peace. We spoke with the President about joint actions: the support of the United States that is so urgently needed, and pressure on Russia – pressure for the sake of peace. We discussed the situation on the front lines. We discussed diplomatic efforts. We talked about how to bring closer a real and lasting ceasefire – for at least 30 days. That could open up many opportunities for diplomacy. Ukraine is ready for a full ceasefire starting right now, from this very moment – a 30-day silence. But it must be real. No missile or drone strikes, no hundreds of assaults on the front. The Russians must respond appropriately – by supporting the ceasefire. They must prove their willingness – willingness to end the war. This isn’t the first time, we are offering this once again. Thirty days that could become the beginning of years of peace. A ceasefire, lasting and reliable, will be a real indicator of movement toward peace. America can help with this. The world needs America now just as it did eighty years ago. Of course, we spoke today about our agreement – the Economic Partnership Agreement with America. We emphasized how important it is for our relations to strengthen both of our countries for decades to come. And they will. I instructed the team to work quickly on establishing a joint Ukraine-United States Investment Fund – a fund for investing in our recovery. We also agreed with President Trump on our further contacts. Overall, today was a very active day. I spoke with Germany’s new Chancellor, Friedrich Merz – we agreed to cooperate. There are already concrete steps we can take together. Decisions will follow. I also spoke today with President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen to discuss our steps: accession to the European Union, our negotiations, our defense support, the assistance provided to our country and to our resilience. We must continue to defend Ukraine and our entire Europe together. That is exactly what we are doing. I thank everyone who is helping! I thank all those who are defending our national interests and our independence! Glory to Ukraine!
