I wish you good health, fellow Ukrainians! The most important updates. First – the military. Today, several reports have already been made regarding our frontlines and our operations. The Armed Forces, the Security Service of Ukraine, and the intelligence agencies – I thank everyone for their long-range effectiveness. Everyone can see that Ukrainian drones are hitting their targets. There was a report by General Syrskyi, with a lot of attention specifically on the Pokrovsk direction. There are successful actions by our units in the Sumy region. Thank you! They are eliminating the occupiers in the border areas. This is crucial. Today, unfortunately, there were numerous Russian strikes on our cities and our communities: Sumy – including Ukrainian energy infrastructure, as well as Dnipro, Kharkiv, Kherson region, and Donetsk region. Wherever needed, rescuers from the State Emergency Service of Ukraine and all relevant services respond immediately. I thank you all for your promptness. We will respond to every Russian strike. There were important reports from our intelligence agencies, including one from the Foreign Intelligence Service on the effectiveness of sanctions against Russia and Russia-affiliated entities. The enemy’s losses – economic losses – are truly being felt. And they will be felt even more. I want to thank everyone in the world who is helping. Now is precisely the moment when pressure needs to be put on Russia, so strong that next year there is no war. They must realize that they will not be able to wait it out. Sanctions must effectively strip Russia of its potential. We are working to achieve this. I also had a discussion with the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine. Also, our diplomacy maintains a daily rhythm of work, with a lot of communication with partners these days. I instructed the Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council to be more active in attracting external funding for drones. I also instructed government officials and the Minister of Defense of Ukraine to more actively review all our agreements we have with our partners – the ones we must implement fully, but which, unfortunately, are currently still only partially being carried out. I expect the relevant reports this week. And one more thing. There is a government decision to support universities in the frontline regions and border cities – in the Sumy region, Zaporizhzhia, Kharkiv. Additional funding – UAH 300 million – is being allocated specifically for these difficult conditions, for the educational institutions that preserve our student communities, our student groups, that continue to teach against all odds. Great job! It is extremely important to preserve Ukrainian educational centres. Karazin University, and many others. We will continue to support you. I also signed a decree today regarding the Shevchenko Prize – this is a step toward expanding the award. There have been many discussions with experts and the cultural community. The Prize Committee has done a great job. So, starting next year, the Shevchenko Prize may also be awarded – apart from traditional nominations – for Ukrainian photography. And now, in the conditions of war, it is so important to capture all the emotions and all the prowess of our people. A new category for curatorial work has also been added, as well as one for contemporary design – and there is truly a lot of our powerful Ukrainian graphic design, fonts, and more; all this deserves our particular attention. We also broadened the usual literature and music nominations of the Shevchenko Prize. And we will continue looking for ways to thank those among our people who preserve Ukrainian cultural heritage. This will be a special format, and before Ukraine’s Independence Day, together with the cultural community and all experts, we will find the necessary solutions. I thank everybody standing with us, with Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!
