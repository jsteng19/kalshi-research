Dear attendees, ladies and gentlemen, our dear warriors, representatives of the Ukrainian authorities, members of the diplomatic corps, dear Andrzej – Mr. President of Poland, dear people of Ukraine! Today, we are marking Constitution Day of Ukraine – the Constitution of our state, our nation. The first word of its first article is “Ukraine.” And this reflects our ultimate goal, our mission. Ukraine is – and will be – on earth. Ukrainians are – and will be – on earth. This is both our goal and our shared duty. It is the mission of everyone for whom Ukraine truly comes first – of those who cannot imagine their lives without Ukraine, and without whom Ukraine can no longer be imagined. We are a state of millions. But for us, millions have never been – and will never be – just a mass of people. This is a nation made up of citizens who have the strength to stand up for what they believe in and what they strive for. And that is precisely why Ukraine stands. Ukraine is millions of names we are proud of. Ukraine is the choice our people make every day. It is millions of actions and feats that, together, are Ukraine. And the social contract among all of us is this: Ukraine comes first. Ukrainians – our independence, our rights, our dreams – of an entire people – come first. And when we say this, the words carry power. Because these are not words about something abstract – they are about real people, real deeds, and a real path that has been endured. About all of us. About the citizens who breathe life into Ukraine – everything from its Constitution to each of its days. It is these people who write the pages of history and fill the pages of the Constitution with life. With their example, their deeds, and their heroism. One of these stories is that of Junior Sergeant Oleksandr Ivantsov. At the beginning of the war, he volunteered for an extremely difficult operation carried out by the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine. After flying over 100 kilometers by helicopter as part of an air assault group, he landed at Azovstal. Later, destroying enemy forces, he broke out of encirclement on his own, crossed more than a hundred kilometers through occupied territory, reached Ukraine, and continued to defend it. Today, his wife and his mother are here with him. I am certain they are proud of their husband, son, and, as of today, Hero of Ukraine. Among those our nation is proud of is Volodymyr Zakhliupanyi. For 30 years, Volodymyr Mykolaiovych has been bringing the light of knowledge to children at the lyceum in Hostomel. He lost his son, who was killed by the invaders during the occupation, yet he did not break. He continues to dedicate his life to hundreds of other children – to his students, those he mentors, the next generations of Ukrainians. They will surely hear and know the stories of those who preserve Ukraine, who defend its Constitution, its independence, and human life. As does Olena Stavytska from the Sumy region. As part of the “White Angels” group, she helps those affected by shelling, provides medical aid, and carries out evacuations of our people. Just this year alone, that’s over 1,000 Ukrainians – including 370 children. The youngest among them was only 6 days old. Live to help. Give all your strength so that Ukraine may stand strong. This is the principle followed by millions of our citizens. And many of them have given their lives so that Ukraine may live. Among such heroes is Colonel of the Air Force Viktor Polyvianyi. During the course of combat operations under his command in the southern direction, nearly 700 aerial targets were destroyed: aircraft, cruise missiles, Iskanders, nearly 500 Shaheds, and much more evil that was flying toward our land, toward our people. Officers like him are our pride. The loss of such true officers is our pain. The memory of Hero of Ukraine Colonel Polyvianyi will remain with us forever – just like the memory of all those who have fallen for Ukraine’s freedom. We will carry their memory in our daily work, in our struggle, in the hundreds of other deeds, triumphs, and stories. I now ask everyone to honor the memory of all fallen heroes with a moment of silence. Ladies and gentlemen! Today, on Ukraine’s Constitution Day, we express our gratitude to everyone who contributes to what truly matters every single day. Those who have been on the front line since 2014. Those who deliver everything that’s needed. Those who brave fire and darkness so that life can go on in our cities and villages. Those who held their position alone for days on end. Those who suffered severe injuries but never lost their spirit – and completed a series of six world marathons. Those who perform the most complex surgeries 24/7, because in the work of saving lives, there is no eight-hour workday – only a round-the-clock need to fight for life. Our warriors, our volunteers, medics, teachers, artists, our athletes, and millions of Ukrainian citizens – all of them are people whose spirit and resilience match the challenges of our time. People whom the war has deprived of sleep and rest, whose lives it has changed, whose rights it has restricted – and yet they do more than what is required by constitutional duty. More. They act not out of obligation to the law, but out of the call of the heart. And there are not just hundreds or even thousands of such stories. There is no square in the world large enough to hold all the Ukrainian men and women who deserve our gratitude, respect, and applause. Thank you! Ladies and gentlemen! Our Constitution states that the defense of Ukraine is the most important function of the state and the duty of the entire Ukrainian people. But how important and precious it is to feel that in this duty, the Ukrainian people are not alone. Standing with us are true friends. Brothers-in-arms. Allied states and entire nations. The Walk of the Brave, located on Constitution Square, is dedicated to their solidarity and commitment to us. The Walk of the Brave that bears the names of those who stood with Ukraine from the beginning and who continue to stand with it now. Among such people is Andrzej Duda – the President of Poland, one of the first to be honored on the Walk of the Brave. He continues to stand with us, and he is here with us today – and I am truly glad that you are here today, my dear friend. In the first month of the war, we were in constant contact – every day, every night, 24/7. When the Polish people were helping so many of our Ukrainians, when you and I were working together, when we opened the first hub in Rzeszów – I remember it very well – from there, such vital weapons were delivered – such a lifeline, such essential aid for our army, for our entire people. So that we could endure. So that we would not fall. So that we could live. And stand here today. Thank you for the unity – the unity that the Ukrainian and Polish nations have not lost. Thank you! And we also thank all the nations of the civilized world for their unity around Ukraine. Unity with Europe. Unity with America. The unity of a world that understands what it means to fight for the greatest constitutional right of any nation: the inalienable right to life. The inalienable right to independence. The inalienable right to live in peace – to live in safety, in progress, in a free Ukraine. This is all Ukraine strives for. And no one can say that Ukraine is asking for too much. That is why Ukraine will undoubtedly achieve it. All of us will – all those for whom Ukraine truly comes first. All those for whom Ukraine truly stands above all. Happy Constitution Day of Ukraine, dear citizens! Glory to Ukraine!
