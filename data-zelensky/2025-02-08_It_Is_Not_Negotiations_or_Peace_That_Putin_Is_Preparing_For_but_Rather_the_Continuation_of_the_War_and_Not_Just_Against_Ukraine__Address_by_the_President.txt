I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! Today, the new Chair of the NATO Military Committee is in Ukraine. He is making his first visit specifically to our state to show support for Ukrainians. We appreciate it. Today we discussed preparations for Ramstein and our defense needs – of our shared defense. We now know – as our intelligence reports – that the Russians are creating new divisions and developing new military production facilities. It is clear that their cooperation with North Korea will be expanding. Unfortunately, Moscow is spreading modern technologies – war technologies – to that region, including drone technology. And this means one simple thing: it is not negotiations or peace that Putin is preparing for, but rather the continuation of the war, and not just against us, against Ukraine. They are now increasing their army by more than a hundred thousand soldiers. All partners should know and should see it. We are ready to share the relevant information, and the respective communication is already underway through the intelligence channels. We must see together what the threats are and what countermeasures we have. We need a clear understanding: here in Europe, every country will have to strengthen its defense, and the target of 5% of GDP for defense will not disappear from the agenda. This week, I would also like to thank the United Kingdom for the funds announced to support our resilience, and not only defense resilience, but also energy resilience, as well as economic and social one. An important step in the development of our military aviation – the Mirage fighter jets from France, as we agreed with President Macron. Thank you, Emmanuel! They are already working for our defense. This capability will be expanded. We are also receiving additional F16s – new aircraft from the Netherlands. Thank you very much! And one more thing. We are preparing a clear schedule of meetings with our key partners: America, Europe, the Islamic world. We have specific dates. We will continue our work. I thank everyone who is helping us! Glory to Ukraine!
