I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! Today marks a new step in our state application "Army Plus" – transfers are now possible for the warriors of the National Guard of Ukraine. Currently, at the first stage, transfers are available within the National Guard, but the goal is to enable transfers between units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the National Guard as well. In the near future, units from our Border Guard Service will also be integrated into Army Plus. As of today, there have already been 3,607 approved transfer requests for our warriors of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The team from the Ministry of Internal Affairs has actively worked with the Ministry of Defense to deliver results for our National Guard. Thank you! This is a concrete positive step for the warriors and an opportunity to give people greater motivation. Today, we have another positive result from our eSupport program – nearly seven and a half million applications have been submitted. Of these, more than two million are for children. Payments are already being made, and 4.5 billion hryvnias have already been transferred to people. The largest spending category is utility services, and now, in winter, it is really important to support as many of our people, our Ukrainian families as possible. Please, register for eSupport. The program also allows payments for our train tickets, Ukrainian books, donations to volunteers… Everyone can choose the option that best suits their needs. This is support for all our people across the country. Today, I discussed with our government officials – the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food – the issue of food assistance under the "Grain from Ukraine" program, including aid for Syria. This is our humanitarian program, which has already contributed significantly to stabilizing the food situation in vulnerable regions around the world. Now, we can help Syrians with Ukrainian wheat, flour, and oil – our products that play a global role in ensuring food security. We are coordinating with our partners and the Syrian side to address logistical issues. We will certainly support this region so that stability there can become a foundation for us in moving toward real peace. And of course, today I received a report from Commander-in-Chief Syrskyi on the situation at the front and in the areas of the Kursk operation. The situation remains difficult in the Pokrovsk sector and with Kurakhove. I am grateful to all the units that are destroying the occupiers there. I would also like to express particular gratitude to our warriors in the Kursk region – we need strength there to achieve the right outcomes for Ukraine and Ukrainians in diplomacy. Everyone fighting for Ukraine right now is truly securing Ukraine's future. We need a lasting peace. A guaranteed peace. We will undoubtedly achieve our objectives. Glory to Ukraine!
