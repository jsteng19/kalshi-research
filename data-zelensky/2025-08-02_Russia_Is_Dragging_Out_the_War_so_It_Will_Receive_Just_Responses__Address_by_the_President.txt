Dear Ukrainians! Briefly about today. This morning, decrees were issued expressing our nation’s gratitude to those who are doing – and have done – everything to defend Ukraine, our people, and a normal life. Journalist Viktoriia Roshchyna was awarded the Order of Freedom – tragically, posthumously. For many, she embodied freedom itself, and it is very important that she is remembered now – remembered by everyone, remembered by Ukrainian journalists and by many caring people. Eternal memory to her! I also conferred the title of Hero of Ukraine on our warriors: Lieutenant Colonels Roman Onopriicha and Mykola Shevchuk – these are guys from the Security Service of Ukraine and the National Guard – as well as Colonel Oleh Myronenko, also a National Guard serviceman. And I awarded Crosses of Military Merit to three more warriors of the Armed Forces of Ukraine – very tough guys. They are warriors from the 5th Separate Heavy Mechanized Brigade: soldiers Yevhen Netesanyi and Oleksandr Kurtse, and Sergeant Volodymyr Huzenko. These guys showed extraordinary bravery and exceptional resilience in combat in the Donetsk region – in the Pokrovsk district, at positions in Andriivka. We are proud of such warriors of ours. Today, I also met with our Ukrainian champion and true legend of Ukraine, Oleksandr Usyk. I thanked him for the victories he achieved for Ukraine and Ukrainians, for the motivation he gives us, and for the Ukrainian spirit that manifests itself to the world. Oleksandr and I agreed that he will also support Ukraine on the international track – in our relations with the United States of America. Ukraine must be heard at all levels. And Ukrainian strength is certainly being heard. We also discussed the development of sports infrastructure and the promotion of physical activity among young Ukrainians. We will implement everything. Today, I also met with the heads of NABU and SAPO – Semen Kryvonos and Oleksandr Klymenko. Anti-corruption agencies have exposed a deputy of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, along with heads of district and city administrations and National Guard servicemembers, for bribery. Unfortunately, these corruption schemes involved the procurement of electronic warfare systems and FPV drones. This is absolutely immoral. There must be full and fair accountability for this. I thanked the heads of the anti-corruption agencies for their work – for such exposures. And I want to thank them for their teamwork. NABU and SAPO have every opportunity to operate effectively. We are counting on fair verdicts. Minister of Internal Affairs Ihor Klymenko also reported today. An internal investigation is already underway in the National Guard. I expect serious results. Only combat officers will hold leadership positions in all logistics units of the National Guard. I have instructed the Minister to publicly present all the details of these changes. Today, I also received a report from the Head of the Security Service of Ukraine, Vasyl Maliuk. I want to express my gratitude for our special long-range operations on Russian territory. Their impact is significant. And each of them is tangible for the enemy, and our operations will continue – Russia is dragging out the war, so it will receive just responses. There were also relevant operations by the Security Service of Ukraine this week against those who weaken our defense. A particularly serious Russian agent embedded in the Air Force was exposed, as well as a former official of Ukraine’s Defense Ministry who tried to profit from the procurement of food supplies for our army. All our law enforcement agencies – and everyone who holds a position tasked with protecting our state and our people – all must deliver results for Ukraine. For all of us. For our Ukraine’s resilience. For justice in Ukraine. For the defense of Ukraine. And the protection of all of us, our people. Glory to Ukraine!
