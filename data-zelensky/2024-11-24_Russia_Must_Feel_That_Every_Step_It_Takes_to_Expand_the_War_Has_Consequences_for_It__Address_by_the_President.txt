Dear Ukrainians! And all our partners! As we come to the end of the week – the week in which Russia took yet another step to expand the war by striking Ukraine with a new missile – it’s important for us to acknowledge and thank everyone who has taken new steps to support our nation, our people, and our life. Ukraine has friends. Ukraine has those it can rely on, and because of this, we are able to respond to Russian terror and defend lives. This week brought new defense packages. Denmark committed close to a billion kroner – funds that will support our defense industry. Norway has prepared the first tranche, which, following the Danish model, will support arms production, specifically production in Ukraine. Sweden will also contribute funding following Denmark’s model. The United States has approved a $275 million package, including munitions for HIMARS, as well as Javelins, drones, and mines that we urgently need to defend positions, particularly in the Donetsk region. Germany has provided a new package as well. There is a new NASAMS from Canada. I am deeply grateful for every single step like this. Sanctions are no less important – this week we have new US sanctions against Russia, very effective ones against the banking sector. These measures significantly weaken Putin’s system, and we need more of them. He must constantly lose the means to finance its war – week after week. And no matter how much Russia tries to blackmail everyone it can, we must not lose our resolve, we must keep pushing, and only in this way will real peace become closer. Today, Ukraine’s Security Service and the Ministry of Internal Affairs presented media agencies with fragments of the Russian missile that struck Dnipro. Experts are currently analyzing the evidence and working with our partners to establish all the details and specifications of this missile, and to find a response together to this latest Russian escalation. The world has air defense systems capable of countering such threats. Everyone must focus on this. Russia must feel that every step it takes to expand the war has consequences for it. Those consequences are reflected in our actions at the front, in the actions of our warriors, our units. They are also reflected in the actions of the world, in how the world responds. Putin cannot be given a single week to adapt or find countermeasures. We must consistently do everything to force Russia into seeking peace – true peace. This can only be achieved through two things: helping Ukraine and pressuring Russia. I thank everyone around the world who is doing just that – standing with us, with Ukraine, with the Ukrainian people. I thank all our people who are fighting and working for the sake of Ukraine.
