Dear Ukrainians! First and foremost, gratitude to our air defenders. Every night now brings massive Russian drone attacks – nearly a hundred Shaheds each time. Many are being shot down. As of this morning alone, 97 drones were shot down overnight. Mobile fire groups, electronic warfare units, air defense crews – thank you. Unfortunately, there are also hits. We need significantly more effectiveness in our air defense. The development of an efficient air shield will not stop. Today, I would like to thank all our partners who are helping us in this. But we need more air defense systems, more ammunition specifically for shooting down drones. We are discussing this with all our partners. Last night in Kyiv, tragically, three people were killed by Russian drones, including a father and his five-year-old daughter. Just a day earlier in Zaporizhzhia, a Russian strike took the lives of an entire family – a mother, a father, and their daughter. My condolences to all the families and loved ones. There must be more pressure on Russia to stop this terror. And that depends on all our partners – the U.S., Europe, and others around the world. After the last meeting in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, it has become absolutely clear to the entire world: Russia is the only one dragging this war out, the only one that brought it here – and the only one who needs it to continue. Since March 11, a proposal for an unconditional ceasefire has been on the table – and these attacks could have already stopped. But it is Russia that continues all this. Every night, every single day, it carries out the most cynical strikes. Without pressure on Russia, those in Moscow will continue to show contempt for real diplomacy and keep destroying lives. Today is the second meeting between the Ukrainian and U.S. teams in Saudi Arabia. This time at a more technical level – with our military, diplomats, and representatives from the Ministry of Energy. I just spoke with Rustem Umerov, who briefed me on the meeting and the course of negotiations. Our team is working in a fully constructive manner, and the discussion is quite useful. The work of delegations continues. But no matter what we’re discussing with our partners right now, Putin must be pushed to issue a real order to stop the strikes – because the one who brought this war must be the one to take it back. Today, I also want to recognize our warriors – all of our men and women in the Defense and Security Forces of Ukraine, in the defense industry of our state, all of our volunteers, and everyone who is working to uphold Ukraine’s resilience. All our people, thanks to whom Ukraine’s positions are strong – thank you! And especially – the warriors of the 72nd Separate Mechanized Brigade – well done! The 59th Separate Assault Brigade of the Unmanned Systems Forces – yesterday, I had the opportunity to personally thank this brigade in the Donetsk region, and today, once again, for their results in combat – thank you! The 152nd Separate Mechanized Brigade – thank you very much, warriors! The warriors of the 3rd Separate Assault Brigade – thank you for your successful actions in the liberation of the village of Nadiya in the Luhansk region. Every day, our people prove that Ukraine deserves respect, deserves to be treated as an equal, and deserves a dignified peace. I am proud of our people! Thank you to everyone around the world, everyone who stands with Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!
