I wish you health! First of all, I would like to thank all our warriors who are defending Ukrainian skies. Overnight, our warriors neutralized another three hundred Russian drones – many of them were shot down. There have been good results in downing ‘shaheds’ with interceptor drones. Army aviation, Air Force aviation, and mobile fire groups did a good job. We are ramping up everything that can provide additional protection for our cities, our Ukrainian communities. Thank you to everyone who is helping. Yesterday, in my conversation with President Macron, we agreed that Ukraine will provide a clear and detailed outline of our current funding needs for drones. The updated document is already being presented to our partners – the Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council, together with the team from the President’s Office, has prepared everything. The drone-related objectives set for this year will be fully met. Today, I spoke with the President of Estonia. I thanked him for the support, and I especially value Estonia’s position, the position of all the Baltic states, in relation to European integration. A clear and principled stance. The same goes for our other friends in the European Union – thanks a lot. Ukraine delivers on its promises. Today, there was an extremely significant statement by President Trump. And it is true: it is Russia who is doing everything to undermine peace efforts and drag out this war. Every night there are strikes, constant Russian attempts to hurt Ukraine. Indeed, peace is possible if we act strongly and decisively, and we have repeatedly said – and all partners know this – that sanctions are a key element. Russia factors in the sanctions, factors in such losses. Peace through strength is possible. Ukraine, as always, is ready to work with America, with President Trump, in the most productive way possible, to end this war with dignity and lasting peace. I thank everyone in our Ukrainian foreign policy team who is working for this – for a truly meaningful relationship with America. A few more things. Today, I signed a law that strengthens the Security Service of Ukraine giving it greater capacity to carry out combat tasks, eliminate the occupier, and conduct special operations to defend Ukraine. The number of personnel is being increased, particularly for the “A” Special Operations Center of the Security Service of Ukraine. These are among our most effective warriors. I also signed the law we discussed with the families of Ukrainians held in Russian captivity – and with our warriors themselves, those who were freed and have returned home. The law restores justice. It resolves the financial issue, ensuring that warriors who were taken prisoner receive the same financial guarantees as all other defenders of Ukraine. Today, I was at the Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War. We held a special meeting dedicated to this particular day – the Day of Remembrance, the Day when we honor the memory of those killed in Olenivka. At that time, the Russians committed one of the biggest massacres – over 50 Azov fighters were killed in Olenivka in an explosion and fire, and nearly 150 others were severely wounded. An absolutely heinous crime. From now on, every year, Ukrainians will honor the memory of all our people who were killed – those who were executed or tortured in Russian captivity, in Russian prisons, in Russian camps, and on the front line. Today, the Headquarters team reported on the current status of our people – those we are searching for among the prisoners and those we are bringing home. Some of those already returned were also present. Taira, Leniie Umerova, Azov fighters, warriors of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Military personnel and civilians. We discussed what needs to be done to improve the rehabilitation of our people after captivity. We talked about how we can make the organization of prisoner exchanges more effective. Following this discussion, I instructed the preparation of draft laws to provide more rights and opportunities to those released from captivity. There are decisions that can be made by the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Health, the military command, and the negotiation team. I expect implementation and reporting by the end of the week. We have already brought back 5,857 of our people through exchanges. We are looking for every single name. We must bring everyone home. Ukrainians deserve to live in peace, in their own home, in an independent Ukrainian state. Glory to Ukraine!
