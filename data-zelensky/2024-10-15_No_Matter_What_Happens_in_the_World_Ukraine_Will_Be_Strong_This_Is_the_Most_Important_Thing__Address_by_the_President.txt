I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! Today, I held a meeting of the Staff – an Energy Staff – to discuss all the key issues of winterization and the protection of energy facilities. Each service and all institutions have clear tasks. Reports were provided on each level of energy system protection. The Prime Minister, the Minister of Energy, and representatives of regional authorities from the most vulnerable regions reported. There was a report by the Commander of the Air Force on air defense: shooting down missiles and drones, as well as our electronic warfare system. We discussed the format for strengthening air defense, and we already have certain decisions regarding “Shahed” drones and some types of missiles. Today, the CEO of Naftogaz, Chernyshov, also reported on the accumulation of gas in storage facilities, and relevant infrastructure protection issues. All elements of winterization – electricity, gas, coal – the things we expect, the things we are preparing for, and the things we need help with from our partners – are absolutely clearly defined. There was a mandatory report by Commander-in-Chief Syrskyi. Regarding the frontline. The situation is challenging, but we are holding our positions, and I am grateful to every brigade, every soldier, sergeant and officer who ensures our resilience. The Kursk operation was mentioned separately. We continue to carry out the defined tasks. Today, the Minister of Defense delivered a report. Regarding my instructions to increase funding for our domestic Ukrainian arms production. Drones, electronic warfare, artillery. Attracting investment from our partners. Our capabilities. By the end of this month, we will have specific new contracts in our Ukrainian defense production. And this is one of our top priorities. No matter what happens in the world, Ukraine will be strong. This is the most important thing. And one more thing. Yesterday, I spoke with Mark Rutte, NATO Secretary General. We coordinated our positions on strengthening Ukraine. Thank you, Mark, for your support! I thank everyone who stands with Ukraine! I thank all our people – those who are fighting, those who are working, those who are helping. Glory to Ukraine!
