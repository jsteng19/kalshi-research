Dear Ukrainians! Right now, assistance is being provided in Kharkiv to those wounded by Russian bombs. This was a brutal strike on the city, right in the middle of the day. And they have been shelling our city of Kharkiv for almost 24 hours straight. Last night, Kharkiv suffered a massive drone strike, and now it is aerial bombs. Dozens of people have been injured in just one day. Tragically, there are fatalities. My condolences to the families and loved ones. And no matter what anyone says, these Russian strikes are not “retaliation” but acts of destruction. The complete destruction of life – that is what they want. And in absolutely every city and village on the occupied territory, it is clearly seen what the arrival of Russia means. The only thing the occupiers care about is military infrastructure and their ability to remove all valuables from Ukraine. In more than eleven years of Russia’s war against us, against Ukraine, they have brought only one new thing to our land – and it is indeed the most widespread Russian “legacy:” ruins and death. We must continue resisting this. I thank everyone around the world who is helping, who is doing this. No form of pressure on Russia can be eased – neither the formats that are already in place nor the methods of pressure that are being prepared. The Russians are preparing to continue the war and are ignoring all peace proposals. They must be held accountable for this. We are working to strengthen Ukraine’s air defense. We urgently need positive signals from the United States – concrete signals regarding air defense systems. We are still waiting for a response to our request to purchase systems that can help — concrete signals, not words. I would like to thank the European countries for the supplies. We must also achieve results in the joint production of air defense systems and missiles for them – this is absolutely essential for our whole Europe. Only time separates us from that result, and what matters most is shortening that time. And one more thing. Today, Minister of Defense of Ukraine Umerov and Commander-in-Chief Syrskyi reported primarily on the actions of our guys on the frontline. There is much to be thankful for. This week, our warriors successfully destroyed Russian positions – specifically those from which they launched strikes on Ukraine, our communities, and our people. In recent days, three Iskander missile systems were destroyed – this was the destruction of outright killers. There is also a downing of a Russian Su-35 military aircraft and damage to their military helicopters. There have also been new strikes on Russian military logistics and airfields. This helps our defense – every complication for Russia matters to us. We are aware that the Russians are now trying to show that they are allegedly immune to any pressure. But it is very important for the world to understand: just as pressure forced Russia into the negotiation process, pressure can force Russia to become realistic in negotiations. This is possible precisely because of the pressure, and above all, sanctions on Russian oil and those who still trade with Russia. Russia must end this war that it started. They must be pushed into this outcome. I thank every one of our partners, all the leaders, and all the countries that help us specifically with this – with new restrictions on Russia and new sanctions. Please do not remain silent about what is really happening, and let us work together for the real result of diplomacy – not just words, but peace. Upcoming are the summits of Southeast Europe, the Group of Seven, the NATO Summit, and other international events – all of which can help, must help, save lives and bring peace closer. Let it be so. Glory to Ukraine!
