I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! Today has been a very long day. I held a Staff meeting, where I received briefings from the military on our positions at the front, the situation with supplies – contracts, weapons packages. The work continues, and I am grateful to every one of our partners who understands the need for strong positions – both on the frontline to protect our people and in diplomacy, where both strength and truth matter. There were reports on deep-strike operations against Russian military facilities and infrastructure supporting the war. For every two dollars invested in our long-range capabilities, we already ensure almost ten dollars in Russian losses. This is the dynamic we need – Russia must feel the cost of war to truly want peace. Additionally, the Head of the Foreign Intelligence Service presented important reports today. And today, we also had a lot of international activities. General Kellogg – a meeting that restores hope. We need strong agreements with the United States – agreements that will truly work. I gave instructions to work swiftly and very sensibly. Economy and security must always go hand in hand, and the details of the agreements matter – the better they are structured, the greater the results. With General Kellogg, we discussed the frontline situation, the need to release all our prisoners held in Russia, and the necessity of a reliable and clear system of security guarantees – one that ensures this war will never return and that Russians will never again destroy lives. We all need peace – Ukraine, Europe, America, everyone in the world. I just spoke with President Macron – we coordinated our positions, discussed the next steps and views on security guarantees in particular. I spoke with the Prime Minister of Denmark – we appreciate that Mette and the people of Denmark feel what we are striving for. I spoke with the Prime Minister of Norway – not only about our bilateral relations but also about Europe’s future and energy security. I spoke with the President of Finland – there are good and important proposals, and we exchanged views on how the situation is developing. I spoke with the Prime Minister of Canada – I informed him about the current developments, and we discussed prospects within the G7 in particular. I also spoke today with the President of South Africa – I am grateful for the support, support of our sovereignty, and for the position that the peace process must be inclusive. Peace is always a common cause – especially the peace we must leave for all future generations. Thank you all for your help, and for the feeling of unity – unity that is as important now as it was in 2022. I am proud of our people – of everyone who fights, who helps, and who believes that evil must not prevail in wars. And I began this day by honoring the memory of Ukrainians who died 11 years ago… Already 11 years. The Heroes of the Heavenly Hundred. The Heroes of Dignity. Eleven years ago, on this day, Russia's first aggressive steps against our Crimea began. Ukraine will do everything to end this war – everything necessary. And we need a just peace – one worthy of the nation that so bravely defends itself. I am proud of you, Ukrainians! And I see how you defend the truth. This is extremely important. Thank you! Thank you for your support! Glory to Ukraine!
