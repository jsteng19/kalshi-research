Mr. President! Thank you for your strong support, for the decisions that are helping us protect Ukrainians, Ukraine – our home. We deeply appreciate that Ukraine and America have stood side by side from the very first moments of this terrible Russian invasion. Your determination is incredibly important for us to prevail. Yesterday, we had the G7+ meeting on Ukraine’s reconstruction, with more than 30 countries participating, and it was a truly helpful format. We must restore normal life, and we greatly value your leadership, Mr. President. We also have 26 bilateral security agreements with partners based on the G7 Security Declaration. We have a strong security agreement with the US, and we are grateful for it. We will fully implement it. And it is very important that we share the same vision for Ukraine’s security future – in the EU and NATO. And Ukraine is doing an unprecedented number of reforms on this path. Today, we have a new support package, 7.9 billion dollars. This will be a great help! I raised with President Biden the Plan of Victory. Today, we are preparing to discuss the details to strengthen the Plan, coordinate our positions, views, and approaches. Our teams will work together to ensure the implementation of our future steps. And today in the morning I met with both the Senate and the House, thank you for the unwavering bipartisan support, and to all American people. Together we have to win, we will win. Thank you. ph Working Visit of the President of Ukraine to the U.S. 23 September 2024 - 01:58 PreviousNext ph Working Visit of the President of Ukraine to the U.S. 23 September 2024 - 01:58 News Current events Speeches Congratulations Presidential Office President's wife All news Photos Social activities Conferences and meetings Working visits Foreign visits All galleries Videos President Biography About the President of Ukraine Office Office Management Press Office Upcoming events Newsletter subscription The Presidential Office of Ukraine.
