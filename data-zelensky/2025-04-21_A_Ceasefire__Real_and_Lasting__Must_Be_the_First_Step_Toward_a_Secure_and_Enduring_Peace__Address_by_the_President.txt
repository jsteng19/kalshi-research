I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! Today has been almost entirely devoted to working with partners – in various formats. We are preparing for meetings on Wednesday with partners from Europe – the United Kingdom, France, Germany – and from the United States. Meetings that could bring us closer to a ceasefire and a real, lasting peace. Now, after Easter, the whole world can clearly see the real issue – the real reason why the hostilities continue. Russia is the source of this war. It is from Moscow that a real order must come for the Russian army to cease fire. And if there is no such firm Russian order for ceasefire – then there is no ceasefire. Indeed, there were no air raid alerts on Easter, and some sectors of the frontline remained quiet. This proves it is possible – it’s possible when Russia chooses to reduce the killing. But even so, this Easter, there were still Russian assaults, strikes, and shelling, there were losses, including among civilians. Today, there have been even more Russian strikes. By just the middle of the day – by 1:00 p.m. – there have already been nearly three thousand instances of shelling, assaults, and other strikes. There were Russian missile launches, Shaheds, nearly ninety aerial bombs, the use of heavy weaponry, and drones. Russian attacks continue across the entire frontline. In the evening, I expect a new report from Commander-in-Chief Syrskyi. That means Russia has rejected not only the U.S. proposal for a full and unconditional ceasefire, which was made more than a month ago during the talks in Jeddah, but also yesterday’s proposal – the proposal to continue doing everything possible to maintain the ceasefire after Easter. All of this once again shows what Moscow truly wants. Nevertheless, Ukraine stands by its offer — at the very least, not to strike civilian infrastructure. And we expect a clear answer from Moscow. We are ready for any conversation on how to ensure this. There is an obvious, simplest, and most reliable way: stop missile and long-range drone attacks. That alone would automatically ensure the safety of all civilian infrastructure. A ceasefire – real and lasting – must be the first step toward a secure and enduring peace. Ukrainian representatives – both at the meetings held in Paris and at the meetings scheduled this week in London – will have a primary task regarding an unconditional ceasefire. That must be the starting point. Peace begins in silence. And only when there is genuine silence, and when people trust the entire negotiation process, can the fundamental issues begin to be resolved. And one more thing. I thank all our warriors who are defending Ukraine, who are holding the lines, who are making diplomacy possible. Strong diplomacy is the diplomacy of a strong state and a strong nation. To all our people who are standing in defense of Ukraine, to everyone helping, to everyone supporting Ukraine – thank you! Thank you! I am proud of our people. Glory to Ukraine!
