I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! We are planning our foreign policy activity for the second half of September and October. The priorities are clear: air defense and the full implementation of the decisions of the recent Ramstein meeting, as well as our agreements reached with partners in Washington and Paris. Ahead of winter, we must fully implement every agreement regarding the supply of air defense systems, missiles for them, and the procurement contracts. Funding for drones – our production capacity must be fully utilized. We are working with partners on financing for the army in general – by country, we can see which partners will make their contribution. There is still work to be done. Today, there was a report from Ukraine’s Minister of Defense Denys Shmyhal on what needs to be done. By Friday, I expect to have all the details, key calculations, and a report on the decisions. Specifically, regarding the PURL program, which allows us to purchase American weapons. More than two billion dollars have already been allocated under the program, with another one and a half billion announced. We are awaiting those funds and, accordingly, the deliveries. Much depends on our partners – there is good momentum with Europe, and we are awaiting decisions from the United States. In particular regarding the Patriots – this is very important. We have proposed to the United States the purchase of the necessary number of systems. Also on the table is our proposal on drones. We have given our partners serious opportunities not only to invest in production in Ukraine – and our drones are clearly proving their effectiveness – but we are also preparing to build industrial complexes on the territory of partners. These are our joint production facilities with them. For the first time in history, Ukraine will have modern joint arms production with strong countries. Denmark is one of the leaders, but there are also projects we are preparing in other Nordic countries. Work is also underway with our Baltic friends and with Western European countries, including the Netherlands, Germany, and the United Kingdom. We also count on expanding this line of cooperation, and I thank all the partners who are working not just on a day-to-day basis but with a long-term perspective. These are all partnerships that will last for years. We can all see that Russia has no intention of scaling back its war machine, no desire to stop it, and is pursuing further aggressive plans. Only a strong and united European potential – in alliance with America and other partners on our continent – can provide reliable protection. We are also planning an active week of our diplomacy at the UN General Assembly – and it is important that this week give impetus to diplomacy. Now – one week before the General Assembly – President Trump will be in Europe. We continue our very active work with European leaders to ensure that we are all coordinated and actually reach decisions to put pressure on Russia – decisions that will have to be made anyway. And if the world does not deliver a truly tangible response to Russia’s prolonging of the war, if sanctions and tariffs are postponed, if the Russian army can already launch drones with impunity even against Poland – Putin will continue to see it as permission to wage war. I want to thank our partners who take a strong stance, who respond rather than wait. Action is needed. I thank everyone who stands with Ukraine! I thank all our people! Glory to Ukraine!
