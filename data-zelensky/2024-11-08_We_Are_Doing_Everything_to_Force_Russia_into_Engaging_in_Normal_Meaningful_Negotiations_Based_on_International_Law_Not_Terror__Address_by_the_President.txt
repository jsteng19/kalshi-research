I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! Today has been completely filled with meetings and consultations in Kyiv, following the European Political Community Summit in Budapest. Ukraine's position has been presented. And overall, the development of European policy for the coming period should be collaborative, coordinated, and directly supportive of our partnership in Europe and the Euro-Atlantic community. Just as global affairs collapse without a strong America, maintaining stability for European nations is simply impossible without a strong Europe. And next week should also bring relevant results – results in our work with partners. Today, I spoke with the President of Finland. About our cooperation – both bilateral and with a wider range of partners. I am grateful to Finland for all the defense and political support we receive. We have already received 26 military assistance packages. I am grateful! We also discussed the prospects for the coming months, as well as Finland's contacts with other states, with other leaders, which are crucial in ensuring real peace for Ukraine and all of Europe. We are doing everything to force Russia into engaging in normal, meaningful negotiations based on international law, not terror. The Commander-in-Chief delivered a report today. The frontline. Kurakhove direction and Pokrovsk direction are the most challenging at the moment. The military command and the brigade command are working to strengthen our positions. I have continued our national tradition of honoring the Heroes of Ukraine – the warriors who have shown tremendous courage and deserve our utmost gratitude. Another 30 apartments for our Ukrainian Heroes. Warriors and families of warriors of the Land Forces, Air Force, Naval Forces, Airborne Assault Forces, Special Operations Forces, Territorial Defense Forces, National Guard of Ukraine, as well as the employee of the State Emergency Service of Ukraine in the Kharkiv region – unfortunately, a fallen Hero of Ukraine. This will always remain the foundation of Ukraine's policy towards Heroes – not just our memory of those who saved Ukraine with their courage, but also our ability to show the state's respect through concrete actions, concrete decisions, and concrete care for Ukrainian Heroes. And one more thing. There was a special instruction from me to the Government for the entire Ukrainian school system – for all Ukrainian teachers. Something that will support them next year. A fixed supplement for all school educators: starting in January, one thousand hryvnias for each teacher, and in September there will be an increase, and it will be two thousand hryvnias. Today, the Cabinet of Ministers made the decision. We all understand that our state's resources are limited, but the Government must help people who work in Ukraine and, of course, for Ukraine. The funds are in place. Government officials are now preparing other decisions, including the winter support package for Ukrainians; these decisions will be presented this month. I am grateful to everyone who stands with Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!
