I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! Today, I’m on the front line. Right now, in Kupyansk. Earlier, I was in Pokrovsk, visiting our brigades. I congratulated our men and women – our warriors – on Sergeant’s Day. Sergeants are the warriors without whom the effective work of officers and our units in general would be unimaginable. I am grateful to all sergeants who truly set an example for soldiers. The strength of our entire Ukrainian army is the people who serve – serve faithfully and steadfastly. Today, I had the honor of presenting state awards to the best of our warriors, those who have distinguished themselves in battle. I also received briefings from our commanders and updates on the security and social situation in the Donetsk and Kharkiv regions. We are holding our positions! Thank you, warriors! Glory to Ukraine!
