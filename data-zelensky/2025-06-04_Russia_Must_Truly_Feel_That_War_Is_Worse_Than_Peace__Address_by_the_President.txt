Dear Ukrainians! It has been a long day today. I started it with a conversation with the President of Finland – we discussed our diplomatic opportunities. The negotiations in Türkiye, our cooperation with the United States, and our European prospects, which are important not just for Ukraine. I am grateful to President Stubb for his support. I also spoke today with Chancellor Merz of Germany. We’re working to accelerate the implementation of the agreements we reached during my visit to Berlin. I briefed him on the meeting in Türkiye. All of us in Europe need an end to this war and a truly reliable peace. This is very important. There was also a meeting in the Ramstein format today. And it is important that this format of our cooperation with partners remains in place. We are preparing decisions to support our joint defense production with partners. This is long-term security – these are our guarantees, European guarantees – guarantees for everyone that Russian aggression will not be able to expand and will not be rewarded. Russia must truly feel that war is worse than peace. And that is exactly why sanctions are needed – especially against their oil trade. Sustained defense support for Ukraine is also essential, to protect our people and to defend our positions. And of course, we must have an understanding of the foundations for Ukraine’s post-war development. For sure. People need to know what our Ukrainian recovery will bring. And this matters not only to our citizens, but also to every one of our partners – all those who are helping us now during the war, and who, thanks to that help, can have greater opportunities in our economic cooperation. And one more thing. Today, I thanked the Ukrainian warriors – warriors of the Security Service of Ukraine, who carried out our largest-ever defensive operation on Russian territory. Minus 41 aircraft from Russia’s military aviation. This is precisely what has served not only this war, but also Russia’s broader passion for warfare. Our results are entirely justified. And I am grateful to everyone in the world who is already inspired by our results. I thank everyone who stands with us, with Ukraine, who fights for Ukraine, and who helps us! Thank you! Glory to Ukraine!
