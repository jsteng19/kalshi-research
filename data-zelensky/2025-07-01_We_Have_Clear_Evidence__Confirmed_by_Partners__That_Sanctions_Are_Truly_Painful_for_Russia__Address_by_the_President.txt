Dear Ukrainians! Today, the entire day was spent clearing the rubble after the strike on Huliaipole. Tragically, there are casualties – both military and civilian. Colonel Zakharevych, the commander of the 110th Separate Mechanized Brigade, as well as other men from the brigade were killed. My condolences to all their families and loved ones. A full investigation into the circumstances of this strike is ongoing – I am awaiting a report. Everyone who was wounded – and this was a missile strike – is receiving the necessary assistance. More than 30 people were wounded. We will definitely retaliate against the Russians for this strike. Many different meetings took place today – mainly preparatory meetings. We are getting ready for upcoming meetings in Europe, particularly in Denmark, as well as meetings with other partners of ours. One of the key topics will be weapons production – our joint investments, our joint projects. Today marks the beginning of a new Presidency of the Council of the EU – the Danish Presidency. It is important for us that this period – the next six months – be truly productive in terms of security issues, including for the defense industry, and in terms of sanctions – so that all pressure on Russia truly works, and does so in a way that brings this war to an end and genuinely limits Russia’s potential for aggression. We have clear evidence – confirmed by our partners – that sanctions are truly painful for Russia. And if pressure keeps growing, it will push Russia to think beyond the front and hatred of its neighbors. Today, I spoke with President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev. I thanked him for supporting Ukraine, our independence and territorial integrity. I also expressed our full support and solidarity with Azerbaijan. Right now, Russia is fomenting a new campaign of hostility against its neighbors, and after the brutal killing of two people from the Azerbaijani community in Russia, it is even threatening the Azerbaijani state. All our partners must view this in the same way – not as a threat to one country, but as a threat to everyone – to all those neighboring Russia. By killing some and humiliating others, Russia is trying to intimidate and subjugate everyone. This must be stopped. There must be sufficient protection for the lives of every nation, and absolute respect for human dignity. And a few more things. Ukraine continues to fight for justice – for the just punishment of Russia for its crime of aggression against our state and our people. And for fair accountability for all those who have personally chosen Russia over a peaceful and normal life. Today, I signed the documents to submit our agreement with the Council of Europe on the establishment of the Special Tribunal for the Crime of Aggression for ratification. And we must clearly define the timeline – the specific deadlines – for when all procedural steps required to launch the Tribunal will be completed, and when the Tribunal will actually begin its work. I expect a report on this from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine and the legal team of the Presidential Office immediately after the agreement on the Tribunal is ratified. We are also continuing our work on the Ukrainian sanctions track – new decisions of the National Security and Defense Council on sanctions will be made soon. The relevant materials are already being prepared. Today, I also signed a decree to honor our warriors with state awards – such decrees are issued almost daily, and this time it’s a rather large one. It includes 414 defenders, the majority of whom – 354 warriors – are from the National Guard of Ukraine. Among them are Azov fighters, defenders of Mariupol, and men we brought back from Russian captivity. We continue working to secure the release of all our people – every warrior, every civilian, every adult and child still held in Russian captivity. I thank everyone who is helping us! I thank all our people! Glory to Ukraine!
