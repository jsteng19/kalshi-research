Thank you very much. Chancellor Merkel, it is a great honor to welcome you to the people's house, the White House. Our two nations share much in common, including our desire for security, prosperity and peace.

We just concluded a productive meeting with German and American companies to discuss workforce development and vocational training, very important words. Germany has done an incredible job training the employees and future employees and employing its manufacturing and industrial workforce. It's crucial that we provide our American workers with a really great employment outlook, and that includes making sure that we harness the full potential of women in our economy.

My administration is in the process of rebuilding the American industrial base. A stronger America is in the interest, believe me, of the world as a whole.

I reiterated to Chancellor Merkel my strong support for NATO, as well as the need for our NATO allies to pay their fair share for the cost of defense. Many nations owe vast sums of money from past years and it is very unfair to the United States. These nations must pay what they owe. During our meeting, I thanked Chancellor Merkel for the German government's commitment to increase defense spending and work toward contributing at least two percent of GDP.

I want to thank the chancellor for her leadership in supporting NATO and its efforts in Afghanistan. This has come at significant cost, including the lives of over 50 German soldiers whose sacrifice we greatly honor. I also appreciate Chancellor Merkel's leadership, along with the French president, to resolve the conflict in Ukraine where we ideally seek a peaceful solution.

Most importantly, our two countries must continue to work together to protect our people from radical Islamic terrorism and to defeat ISIS. I applaud Chancellor Merkel for Germany's contributions, both civilian and military, as a counter-ISIS coalition member. We also recognize that immigration security is national security. We must protect our citizens from those who seek to spread terrorism, extremism and violence inside our borders. Immigration is a privilege, not a right, and the safety of our citizens must always come first without question.

Over lunch, the chancellor and I will talk about our economic partnership. Me must work together towards fair and reciprocal trade policies that benefit both of our peoples. Millions of hard-working U.S. citizens have been left behind by international commerce, and together, we can shape a future where all of our citizens have a path to financial security. The United States will respect historic institutions and we will also recognize the right of free people to manage their own destiny.

The close friendship between America and Germany is built on our shared values. We cherish individual rights, we uphold the rule of law and we seek peace among nations. Our alliance is a symbol of strength and cooperation to the world. It is the foundation of a very, very hopeful future.

Thank you.

Thank you very much. We'll do a couple of questions. Mark Halperin.

Thank you, Mark. We just have a -- a really wonderful group of people meeting later. We met with 12 pretty much noes in Congress. You saw that quite a while ago. And they went from all noes to all yeses. And we have a lot of yeses coming in. It's all coming together.

We're gonna have great health care. It's going to be passed I believe -- I think substantially and pretty quickly. It's coming together beautifully. You have the conservative groups, you have other groups. Everybody wants certain things.

In the end, we're gonna have a great health care plan. Now, I have to tell you that Obamacare is a disaster. It's failing.

I was in Tennessee. We had a tremendous crowd the other night. And they have -- half of the state is uncovered. The insurance companies have left. And the other half has one insurance company. And that'll probably be bailing out pretty soon also. They'll have nobody here.

Many states where they have one. And you have a lot of places now where they'll have none. Obamacare will fail. It will fold. It will close up very, very soon if something isn't done.

I've often said politically the best thing I can do is absolutely nothing. Wait one year, and then even the Democrats will come say please, please, you got to help us. But it's not the right thing to do for the people.

We have a great plan. We have a plan that's getting more and more popular with the Republican base, with the conservative base, and with people generally. The press has covered it very inaccurately. People are truly covered well. And I think it's gonna be something that's going to be a model to be looked upon.

I'll tell you after we're finished.

A nice, friendly reporter. Well, first of all, I don't believe in an isolationist policy. But I also believe a policy of trade should be a fair policy. And the United States has been treated very, very unfairly by many countries over the years. And that's going to stop. But I'm not an isolationist.

I'm a free trader, but I'm also a fair trader. And our free trade has led to a lot of bad things happening. You look at the deficits that we have, and you look at all of the accumulation of debt. We're a very powerful company -- country. We're a very strong -- very strong country.

We'll soon be at a level that we perhaps have never been before. Our military is going to be strengthened. It's been depleted. But I am a -- a trader. I am a fair trader. I am a trader that wants to see good for everybody worldwide, but I am not an isolationist by any stretch of the imagination. So I don't know what newspaper you are reading, but I guess that would be another example of, as you say, fake news.

I might add that we have many plants and factories coming back into the United States, many jobs are coming back to Michigan, to Ohio, Pennsylvania, to a lot of places where they were losing jobs. And we will have a different policy, but it's going to be a great policy for, not only for the United States, but a great policy worldwide. And I look very much forward to it. Kevin Cirilli.

Well, Kevin, I think we have a very unified Republican party. After all, we have the presidency, we have the House, we have the Senate. And we're getting along very well, I will tell you. And if you were at the meeting that I just attended, where we took 12 no's or semi no's, no yes', and within a short period of time, everyone was very much on board. And a commitment to vote yes.

I think we have a very unified party. I think actually more unified than even the election. You see when they talk about me, I seem to be very popular, at least this week within the party. Because we have our highest numbers -- the highest numbers that I've ever had in the party.

So I think there's a great unification. Health care is a very, very difficult subject, it's a very complex subject, and it's a subject that goes both ways. You do something for one side and the other side doesn't like it. But it's really something that's come together very well, and I think it's going to be very, very popular, extremely popular.

On trade with Germany, I think we're going to do fantastically well. Right now, I would say that the negotiators for Germany have done a far better job than the negotiators for the United States, but hopefully we can even it out. We don't want victory, we want fairness. All I want is fairness.

Germany has done very well in its trade deals with the United States, and I give them credit for it. But -- and I can speak too many other countries, when you look at China, you look at virtually any country that we do business with, it's not exactly what you call "good for our workers." When you look at the horrible NAFTA transaction, NAFTA has been a disaster for the United States.

It's been a disaster for companies, and in particular, it's been a disaster for the workers. A lot of the companies just moved. But the workers are screwed. And it's probably the reason I'm standing here.

Maybe number one that and maybe the military, building up our military, which we will do and we will be stronger than ever before and hopefully not have to use it, but we will be stronger and perhaps far stronger than ever before, but it's probably the reason I'm here is when you talk about trade.

So I think that we are going to be a very different country. I think we are going to be -- gonna have great values, but in terms of our military, it's going to be much stronger and our trade deals are going to be good, solid deals, not deals that lead to closing plants and tremendous unemployment. OK? Thank you.

Very seldom.

Probably wouldn't be here right now, but very seldom. We have a tremendous group of people that listen and I can get around the media when the media doesn't tell the truth, so I like that. As far as wiretapping, I guess by this past administration, at least we have something in common, perhaps.

And just to finish your question, we said nothing. All we did was quote a certain very talented legal mind who was the one responsible for saying that on television. I didn't make an opinion on it.

That was a statement made by a very talented lawyer on Fox, and so you shouldn't be talking to me, you should be talking to Fox. OK?

Thank you very much. Great honor, thank you. Thank you.
