Thank you very much. Good afternoon. I am honored to welcome Prime Minister Erna Solberg of Norway to the White House. Madam Prime Minister, it has been a pleasure to host you today, had some very interesting discussions as we strengthen the wonderful friendship between our two countries.

Norwegians and Americans of so much in common. We're nations made up of strong pioneering and adventurous people, to say the least. Over a thousand years ago, daring voyagers of Norwegian descent, such as Eric the Red, braved treacherous seas in courageous missions of exploration.

Centuries later, during the Second World War, brave Norwegians escaped occupied Norway to fight alongside of Americans and the Allies, including on the beaches of Normandy in 1944. Our friendship builds on this proud and noble history, and is rooted in our commitment to confront the problems of today with that same confidence and that same determination, and I think it might even be greater determination.

We've just concluded a series of discussions on how we can work together to promote a future of security and world prosperity. And also a great future for our respective countries working together. The prime minister and I are both committed to strengthening the NATO alliance.

Norway has made contributions to the NATO-led mission in Afghanistan, where we are doing very well. It's been turned around. As well as to NATO and NATO's enhanced forward presence in Poland and the Baltic states. So I want to thank the prime minister and the Norwegian people for their participation in these efforts.

I encourage Norway to follow through on its commitment to meet the two percent of GDP defense spending obligation. So that together, we can confront the full range of threats facing our nations. And I believe Norway will get there quite soon.

Norway is also a vital and valued member of the campaign to defeat ISIS. Because of us, ISIS has now lost almost 100 percent of the territory it previously held not so long ago in Iraq and in Syria. We're grateful for Norway's civilian assistance efforts, and generous humanitarian aid to the region. They've been out there and really doing an incredible job.

I'm also pleased to share that the economic ties between our two countries are robust and growing. The United States currently has a trade surplus, which is shocking. Can you believe I'm saying we have a surplus? There aren't too many. You're going to have to go back and check your people.

But we're getting more and more surpluses all over the world, I will say that. I told that to the prime minister. But our two countries are robust and growing. The United States currently has a large contingent of products that we sell, and back and forth with Norway. And one of the big products of course is our military equipment.

I want to thank the people of Norway for their commitment to fair and reciprocal trade. A word that you're going to hear more and more coming from this administration, and it should have come from other administrations before me. Reciprocal trade, which benefits us all. Free nations are stronger when the trade is fair. And trade has not been overly fair with the United States, but we've had that great relationship with Norway. But remember the word "reciprocal."""

In November, we started delivering the first F-52's and F-35 fighter jets. We have a total of 52, and they've delivered a number of them all ready, a little ahead of schedule. It's a $10 billion order. Norway also invests about one third of its sovereign wealth fund in American businesses, supporting hundreds of thousands of American jobs.

They're very big investors in our stock market, and therefore the prime minster thanked me very much. Because their market is -- you have done very well with your investments in the United States, right? Thank you. Norway's commitment to mutually beneficial commerce is a model for other nations, and it really is. It's an amazing country.

I look forward to forging an even stronger economic relationship between the United States and Norway, growing this record of success with even more investment and more jobs and more job creation.

We're also proud of our increasing cooperation on health and health security, and also on biodefense. Very important to both countries. I commend Prime Minister Solberg's efforts to promote vaccine development and disease prevention. Together, we can save and improve many, many lives. We're working very, very hard, in some cases together, on cures to many ailments.

Prime Minister Solberg, I want to thank you again for joining us at the White House. For decades, Norwegians and Americans have stood side-by-side against common threats to our freedom, to our security and to our values.

Together, we have fought against fascism and communism and terrorism, and we face threats always together. We're partners. Our partnership has advanced peace, cooperation and respect for human dignity all around the world.

Today, we remain united in our efforts to confront shared challenges, to seize new opportunities and to build a bright and beautiful future for our countries, our people, our children, and I think we're doing very well working together, and we have a newfound friendship. So I want to thank you, and God bless you. Thank you very much.

The U.S. has an impressive business community, and I have commended the leading role it is playing also in the transformation to a green economy. For example, by the fact that one of the big areas we are now importing in Norway is electrical cars from Tesla. And Norway's combating climate change.

It's an important issue for us. And we are committed to the Paris Agreement. But it leads to businesses, and it leads to American businesses also (ph) selling cars in Norway. At the same time, the green economy is an area where we see tremendous economic and business opportunities in the future.

And finally, I think it's important to say that we also are discussing some of the big, difficult issues. For example, the development in Afghanistan, where I think and hope that we can find new future. It's important that we are all working together to find solutions both in North Korea, Afghanistan, Syria and Iraq. And since September 11th, 2001, Norway has contributed to a range of missions and operations including the fight against ISIS.

And I have assured the president we remain unwavering in our commitment to the fight against terrorism all over the world. So, Mr. President, I am looking forward to future cooperation. And thank you for a very fruitful meeting.

Thank you. OK, some questions. How about Sarah Westwood? Where is Sarah? Sarah? Thank you. Washington Examiner.

Right.

No. No. No.

It's got to include the wall. We need the wall for security. We need the wall for safety. We need the wall for stopping the drugs from pouring in. I would imagine that the people in the room, both Democrat or Republican, I really believe they're going to come up with a solution to the DACA problem, which has been going on for a long time. And maybe beyond that, immigration as a whole.

But any solution has to include the wall, because without the wall, it all doesn't work. You could look at other instances, look at what happened in Israel. They put up the wall; they solved a very major problem. We need the wall. We have to have the wall for security purposes. Security is number one. And so the answer is, have to have the wall. Thank you. And please.

When you say "the big war

Right.

Well, maybe he knows something that I don't know, OK?  I would say this...

I would say this. We have a very, very powerful military. We're getting more powerful by the month, by the day. We're ordering a lot of the equipment that you're ordering. We're ordering it, but in larger amounts, to put it mildly. We are building up our military to a point that we've never been before. We're also -- we were very much weakened over the last long period of time, but not with me.

No, I don't expect that. I think we're going to have -- because of strength, peace through strength. I think we're going to have a long period of peace. I hope we do. We have certainly problems with North Korea, but a lot of good talks are going on right now, a lot of good energy. I see a lot of good energy. I like it very much what I am seeing.

I just spoke this morning with the -- as you present, with the president, President Moon of South Korean. He had some really great meetings. His representatives had a great, great meeting. And I had some very good feedback from that. So hopefully a lot of good things are going to work out. No, I think that we will have peace through strength.

Our military will be stronger than it ever was in a very short period of time. And that's my opinion. That's not the generals' opinion. But I think my opinion counts more right now. Thank you.

Erna Solberg

Sir, did you have a question for the prime minister?

Well, I will say this. There is collusion, but it's really with the Democrats and the Russians far more than it is with the Republicans and the Russians. So the witch hunt continues. John, go ahead.

Well, again, John, there has been no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russians, or Trump and Russians, no collusion. When I watch you interviewing all of the people leaving their committees, I mean, the Democrats are all running for office and they're trying to say this, that. But bottom line, they all say there's no collusion.

And there is no collusion. And when you talk about interviews, Hillary Clinton had an interview where she wasn't sworn in. She wasn't given the oath. They didn't take notes. They didn't record. And it was done on the Fourth of July weekend. That is perhaps ridiculous, and a lot of people looked upon that as being a very serious breach. And it really was.

But, again, I'll speak to attorneys, I can only say this. There was absolutely no collusion. Everybody knows it, every committee. I've been in office now for 11 months. For 11 months they've had this phony cloud over this administration, over our government. And it has hurt our government. It does hurt our government.

It's a Democrat hoax that was brought up as an excuse for losing an election that, frankly, the Democrats should have won, because they have such a tremendous advantage in the Electoral College. So it was brought up for that reason. But it has been determined that there's been no collusion and by virtually everybody. So we'll see what happens.

We'll see what happens. I mean, certainly I'll see what happens. But when they have no collusion and nobody's found any collusion at any level, it seems unlikely that you'd even have an interview.

Just to add to the answer, I think it is much better to work with Russia. It's very much a better having to do with North Korea, where we currently have a problem, that should have never been my problem. This should have been a problem solved many years ago when it was much less dangerous. But it was given to me, along with a big mess of other things.

But I will say this, I am for massive oil and gas and everything else, and a lot of energy. Putin can't love that. I am for the strongest military that the United States ever had. Putin can't love that.

But Hillary was not for a strong military, and Hillary, my opponent, was for windmills, and she was for other types of energy that don't have the same capacities at this moment certainly.

So I just want to say it's a lot better to work with other countries. We're working with China on North Korea. We're working with various other countries, and I think we're doing very well. We had a great talk, as you know and as you reported. We had a great talk this morning with President Moon, and I think that a lot of good things are happening. We're going to see what happens.

But working with other countries, whether it's Russia or China or India, or any of the countries that surround this world and encompass this world, that's a good thing, John. That's not a bad thing. That's a very good thing, OK? OK, go ahead.

Well, it wasn't a major topic, I must tell you. We talked about other things, including mostly trade. But I will say that the Paris Agreement as drawn and as we signed was very unfair to the United States. It put great penalties on us. It made it very difficult for us to deal in terms of business. It took away a lot of our asset values. We are a country rich in gas and coal and oil, and lots of other things, and there was a tremendous penalty for using it. It hurt our businesses.

According to some estimates, we would have had to close businesses in order to qualify by 2025. Whereas as an example China, by 2030, they don't kick in until 2030. Russia, some place in the mid-1990's, that was their standard, and that was never a good standard, because that was a dirty standard for the environment.

It treated the United States very unfairly. And, frankly, it's an agreement that I have no problem with, but I had a problem with the agreement that they signed. Because as usual, they made a bad deal.

So we could conceivably go back in. But I say this, we are very strong on the environment, I feel very strongly about the environment. Our EPA and our EPA commissioners are very, very powerful, in the sense that they want to have clean water, clean air, but we also want businesses that can compete. And the Paris Accord really would have taken away our competitive edge, and we're not going to let that happen. I'm not going to let that happen.

One of the great assets of Norway is a thing called water, and they have tremendous hydropower, tremendous. In fact, most of your energy or your electricity is produced by hydro. I wish we'd do some of that, but hydropower is fantastic, and it's a great asset that you have. Thank you very much, great honor. Thank you. Thank you very much.
