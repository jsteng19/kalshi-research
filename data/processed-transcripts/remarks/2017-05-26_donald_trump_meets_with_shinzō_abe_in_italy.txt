Thank you you very much. It's great to have Prime Minister Abe, a friend of mine and somebody... we've just developed a great relationship. And it's wonderful to have you here. We'll be discussing many things, including, of course, North Korea, which is very much on our minds. We'll be discussing terrorism, but I think we will really be, in particular, focused on the North Korean problem. It's a big problem, it's a world problem, and it will be solved. At some point, it will be solved. You can bet on that. And I just want to thank you very much, thank you.

Well, I want to say that it is reconfirmed. It is a close partnership and collaboration, and friendship. We've developed a great friendship, and I look forward to being with you, spending some time with you, and I'll be seeing you through today. And I'll be seeing you, I'm sure, many times over the years to come. And I look forward to that. Thank you.

Thank you very much.
