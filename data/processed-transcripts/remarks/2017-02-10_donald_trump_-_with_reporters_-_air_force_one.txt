It was really good. Are you comfortable?

What?

Sure.

We'll win that battle. The unfortunate part is it takes time statutorially. So it takes a little time. We'll win that battle, but we also have a lot of other options, including just filing a brand new order...

Could very well be, but I'd like to keep you -- you know, I'd like to surprise you. We need speed for reasons of security, so it could very well be that we do that.

Very little. Just in honor of the decision, we will perhaps do that. We'll see. But on Monday or Tuesday.

We're going to have very, very strong vetting, I call it extreme vetting, and we're going to have very strong security in our country. We are going to have people come into our country that want to be here for good reasons.

I don't know about it. I haven't seen it. What report is that?

I haven't seen that. I'll look at that.

He better be careful.

Thank you. Thank you very much.
