So I just wanted to announce -- we've been working all weekend, very diligently, very hard -- that General H.R. McMaster will become the National Security Advisor.

He is a man of tremendous talent and tremendous experience. I watched and read a lot over the last two days. He is highly respected by everybody in the military, and we're very honored to have him.

He also has known, for a long time, General Keith Kellogg, who I also have gotten to know, and he's a terrific man, and they're going to be working together.

And Keith is going to be chief of staff, and I think that combination is something very, very special. I met with many other people, tremendous respect for the people I met with. I know Hohn Bolton, we're going to be asking to work with us in a somewhat different capacity.

John is a terrific guy. We had some really good meetings with him, knows a lot. Has a good, a good, a good number of ideas that i must tell you I agree very much with.

So we'll be talking to John Bolton in a different capacity. And we'll be talking to some of the other generals that I've met that I have really, really gained a lot of respect for. So I think with that, I'd like to ask H.R. to say couple of words. I'd like to ask Keith to say a couple of words, and then I'll see you back in Washington. We're leaving right now for Washington and the White House. General?

You're going to do a great job. General?

And so are you, thank you very much.  What a team. This is a great team. We're very, very honored. Iur country is lucky to have two people like this, and frankly, after having met so many of the people in the military, we're lucky to have all of them. So thank you all very much. I'll see you back in Washington. We're leaving now. Thank you.
