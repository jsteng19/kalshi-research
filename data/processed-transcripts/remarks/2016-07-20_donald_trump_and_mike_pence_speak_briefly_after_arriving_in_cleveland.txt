Thank you everybody. This is really an honor. We're going to win Ohio, right? Come here, Mike. We're going to win Ohio. We're going to win it all. Going to Make America Great Again. That's what we want to do. But the last time I got accused of speaking a little bit long, so this time we have to speak a lot short.

But I just want to introduce a man who's become a friend of mine. Somebody who is going to make an unbelievable vice president of the United States, Governor Mike Pence.

Thank you very much Mike. I just also congratulate Don and Tiffany and Eric is going to have his shot tonight, and Eric's gonna be great, and Ivanka tomorrow night and my whole family. And Karen I want to just tell your whole family is an incredible family and we love having you with us in this endeavor and hopefully we're going to do an amazing job and an amazing job.
