Well, thank you very much, everybody. It's a great honor to have President Kuczynski with us from Peru. Peru has been a fantastic neighbor. We've had great relationships -- better now than ever before. And I have known him for quite a while through reading about the work that he's done, and I believe he's here to get an award at Princeton. An award for what? Explain, please.

Yeah, did very okay. And your daughter goes to --

Right. That's exactly right.

And I assume she's very proud of you getting the big award tomorrow, right?

That's great. Good students, good children. So a very, very special man, and it's an honor to have him in Washington, at the White House. And we're going to talk some business. I understand they're going to be buying quite a bit of our military -- some of our military vehicles. And they are great vehicles. I just looked at it and we're approving it. And use them well. Use them well.

And if you'd like to say something, Mr. President, please.

I guess I do. I guess I do. And we have a problem with Venezuela. They're doing very poorly. And so we'll be talking about a lot of different things.

And thank you all for being here. Thank you.
