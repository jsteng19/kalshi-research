Right.

Thank you very much, Prime Minister. I appreciate it. I very much appreciate the relationship we've had. It's been outstanding. And I guess some people know that; some people don't. But you and I know it. But it's been, really, a very good relationship and I appreciate it very much. We are your largest partner.

You're our largest partner. A lot of people don't know that. I was surprised. I made that statement yesterday, and a lot of people said, "Gee, I didn't know that." But that's the way it is. And there's an opportunity -- I think a great opportunity -- to greatly enlarge that, especially now, in light of what's happening, to tremendously enlarge it and make it a much bigger trading relationship.

So we're going to be working on that today and even a little bit tomorrow and probably into the next couple of weeks. But I think we'll have a very, very substantial trade deal. It'll be a very fair deal. And I think that this is something that your folks want to do, my folks want to do, and we want to do. And we're going to get it done.

I'd just like to congratulate you on having done a fantastic job on behalf of the people of the United States, and it's an honor to have worked with you. And I don't know exactly what your timing is, but stick around. Let's do this deal, okay?  Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
