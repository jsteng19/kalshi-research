I want to thank the President of South Korea, President Moon, for being here. We had a great afternoon yesterday. We had fantastic dinner at the White House -- accomplished a lot, having to do with our thoughts on North Korea and, very much, our thoughts on trade.

We are renegotiating a trade deal right now as we speak with South Korea, and hopefully it will be an equitable deal -- it will be a fair deal to both parties. It's been a rough deal for the United States, but I think that it will be much different and it will be good for both parties. So we're in the process of doing that.

We're also in the process of discussing our, frankly, many options -- and we have many options -- with respect to North Korea. Thank you very much. President. The President will speak.

What many people don't know is that South Korea is a major trading partner with the United States and we want something that's going to be good for the American worker. And I think we'll be able to do that today, and I think we'll be able to do many other things. So the relationship is very, very strong, and our personal relationship with President Moon -- our personal relationship is very, very good. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you.
