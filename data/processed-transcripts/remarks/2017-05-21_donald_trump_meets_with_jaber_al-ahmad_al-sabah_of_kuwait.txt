It's a great honor to be with the Emir of Kuwait, and a special person, a person I've gotten to know very well. They buy tremendous amounts of our military equipment, then they invest in the United States, and that's what we like to hear. We like to hear about jobs, jobs, jobs and they are spending a lot of money on new planes, including the Boeing F-18, which you like very much, which I like very much also, and we appreciate all of the investment that you make in the United States and all of the jobs that you create. Thank you, thank you.

Thank you very much much.

Thank you very much.

So we're doing very well in the fight against ISIS as general Mattis has just explained, and we're going to be having a news conference in about two weeks to let everybody know how well we're doing -- tremendous progress has been made and will continue to be made. And I just want to thank the Emir and his representatives for being here, thank you all very much. And again, a lot of investment is being made by Kuwait, a very wealthy nation of great people, but a tremendous investment is being made by Kuwait into the United States and the people of the United States appreciate that. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you everybody.
