Thank you very much. It's a great honor to have a friend of mine, President Macron. And we've had some very good experiences -- on occasion, not so good, but 99 percent very good.

France is doing very well. We're doing very well. And I think, very importantly, we're doing very well together. We have a lot of trade and we're discussing trade. We'll be discussing it today. We'll be discussing military and defense. And terrorism is a big subject that we're always talking about. And that's why we're here tonight, I think maybe more so than almost anything. And trade.

So I just want to thank you for being here. And it's a great honor. We had a tremendous celebration in the White House a number of months ago, honoring the President and Mrs. Macron, and honoring France. And it was something very special.

Thank you very much. Thank you for being here.

Thank you.

We had dinner at the top of the Eiffel Tower, and it was one of the most beautiful evenings you'll ever see. So that was a great honor. And thank you very much.

Thank you very much, everybody.
