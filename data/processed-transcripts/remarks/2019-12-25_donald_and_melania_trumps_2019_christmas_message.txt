At this sacred time of year, Christians celebrate the birth of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, and rejoice in his love for every person. We give thanks for the millions of Americans who come together, to care for others with compassion, and bring the warmth and bliss of this holy season to our families, our friends, our neighbors, and to those in need.

We say a special prayer for those military service members stationed far from home, and we renew our hope for peace among nations, and joy to the world. On behalf of the entire Trump family, we wish everyone a joyous and merry Christmas, and a very happy, happy New Year.
