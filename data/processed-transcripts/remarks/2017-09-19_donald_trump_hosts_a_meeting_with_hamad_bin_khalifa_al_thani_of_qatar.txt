Well, thank you very much. It's my great honor to be with the Emir of Qatar. And we've been friends a long time; people don't realize that. We know each other for a long time.

And we are right now in a situation where we're trying to solve a problem in the Middle East, and I think we'll get it solved. I have a very strong feeling that it will be solved pretty quickly.

But we're talking, also, trade and many other things. And we've had a tremendous relationship for the last short period of time, especially since our meeting in Saudi Arabia, which I think was an epic and very important -- really a very historic meeting.

And now we want to make the most of it by getting things settled. But we also want to continue trade and many other things. So we look forward to our meetings and our individual meetings, and -- for many years to come.

We will get it solved. Thank you very much everybody. Thank you. Thank you.
