Thank you, everybody. Thank you very much, everybody.

Just very polite, very polite.

It was a great -- we had a great debate. We had a great poll numbers on the debate, and we enjoyed it. I think -- I hope she enjoyed it, too, but I enjoyed it. And -- no, we're looking at it. But, you know, when you win, you don't really necessarily have to do it a second time. So, we'll see, but we had a -- I thought we had a great debate last night. Thank you very much, everybody.

Well, you know, when you -- when you don't win, it's like a fighter. When a fighter has a bad fight, gets knocked out, or loses the fight, the first thing he says is, "We want a rematch." So, we won the debate according to every poll, every single poll. I think that -- are we going to do a rematch? I just don't know. But we'll think about it.

Yeah. I would -- I would do NBC. I'd do Fox, too. I'd do Fox, too. But right now, we have to determine whether or not we even want to do. We had a great night last night. And you see, by the poll numbers, it was really fantastic. Thank you very much, everybody.
