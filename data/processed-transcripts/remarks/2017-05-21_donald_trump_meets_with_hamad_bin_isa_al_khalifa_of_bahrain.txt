Good morning everybody. It's a great honor to be with you.

Our countries have a wonderful relationship together. But, uh, it's been a little strained, but it won't be strained with this administration. We're going to have a very, very long term great, great relationship. I look forward to it very much

Many of the same friends in common.

Thank you for being with us.

Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Thank you very much everybody.
