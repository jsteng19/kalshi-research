Well, thank you very much. It was indeed a good meeting, and mostly pertaining to trade, North Korea and a couple of other subjects that we lightly touched on.

We're making tremendous progress I believe on trade in particular, bringing the deficits down and having a very fair and equal trade, and I look forward to finishing up the discussions.

A lot of great work and great friendships have been built and they will continue to be built. Thank you very much. Thank you.
