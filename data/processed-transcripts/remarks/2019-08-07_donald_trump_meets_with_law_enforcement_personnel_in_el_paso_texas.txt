Well, I just want to thank you. We've done some stops today. We went to Ohio and we just went to a hospital. And they've done an incredible -- just an incredible job. And we were there for a long time. We thought it would be there for a little time. But the love in that place, and the job that the doctors, nurses -- everybody.

But all over the world, they're talking about the job you've done as police, as law enforcement, as first responders. The job you've done is incredible, and everybody is talking about it. And I wanted to come and thank you because you're very special people. Nobody like you. There's nobody better.

There's nobody like you. And, Chief, I want to thank you.

What a reputation you have -- meaning, good. You know that. Meaning, good.

But what a reputation -- like a winner. And you showed it this last week, because that was something we don't want to have to see again. And I know he went out as a coward. He gave up. He just gave up. So explain what happened exactly.

I'd like that. Very good. Very good.

Well, that's great. And we have the governor here -- our great governor, Greg. Thank you very much. And, Dan, we have -- Dan Patrick, Lieutenant Governor. And we have a man -- where's John?

Thank you very much. Great job.

So you didn't know exactly what was going on? You went in there --

Did you know that at the time when you were going in? Did you have any idea that they were there?

But you knew immediately this was like the real deal. This was just -- you could tell there were bullets and this was a bad scene.

It didn't take long.

Oh, come on, let's go.

Let's do it.

Thank you very much. It's my honor. Thank you very much.  Yes. They work together well. They work together well.  How are you. Thank you very much.

So I want to just thank everybody again.

The job you've done is incredible. And we're with you all the way. We -- I can tell you, we've sent you a lot of equipment over the last two and half years -- getting close to three years, hard to believe. But a lot of equipment came your way. A lot of equipment that wasn't being used came your way -- the military equipment that you have that wasn't going to be distributed for some reason.

Someday, somebody will explain why. But that was the way it was. But it was a lot different. And you deserve it. But we are with you 100 percent. And the Chief knows: Any problems, he just calls me and I'm there. You know that, right?
