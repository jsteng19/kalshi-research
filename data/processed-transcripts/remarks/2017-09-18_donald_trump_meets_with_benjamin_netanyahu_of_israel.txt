Well, thank you very much. It's great to have Prime Minister Netanyahu with us today, a friend of mine for many years. And it's a real honor, I have to say.

We're going to be discussing many things; among them, peace between the Palestinians and Israel -- it will be a fantastic achievement. We are giving it an absolute go. I think there's a good chance that it could happen. Most people would say there's no chance whatsoever.

I actually think with the capability of Bibi and, frankly, the other side, I really think we have a chance. I think Israel would like to see it, and I think the Palestinians would like to see it. And I can tell you that the Trump administration would like to see it.

So we're working very hard on it. We'll see what happens. Historically, people say it can't happen. I say it can happen. But I just want to say, Mr. Prime Minister, it's an honor to have you. Thank you.

Thank you very much.

Thank you very much.

Thank you very much. Appreciate it.

You'll see very soon. You'll be seeing very soon.

We're talking about it constantly. Constantly. We're talking about plans constantly.

We'll see.
