Yes, thank you.

That's right, that's right.

Well, we had a great group of people together, and really done a fantastic job together. I'd like to thank Prime Minister May for being with us. We've had tremendous talks. There is no country that could possibly be closer than our countries. And I just want to say thank you very much.

We are working on a trade deal -- a very, very big deal, a very powerful deal. Great for both countries. And I think we'll have that done very, very quickly. We have all of our trade people. We have Wilbur Ross with us. We have all of the trade people.

Rex and I had a tremendous meeting yesterday with President Putin, and we've had really great meetings with a lot of people. We're having a lot today. But Prime Minister May and I have developed a very special relationship, and I think trade will be a very big factor between our two countries. I want to thank you very much.

I will be going to London, yes.

We'll work that out. We will be going to London. We'll be going to London.
