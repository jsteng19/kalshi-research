Well, thank you very much. This is a special moment. I spoke with Allen Jones about a year ago. And Allen now is 95 years old. Great World War II hero. And when I spoke to him, I said, "Come on up to the White House sometime and I'll see you." And guess what? He called and he said, "Hey, you promised." And I deliver, right?

I deliver. We don't play games. And it's an honor to see you, Allen. And Allen is with some of his friends -- Sidney Walton, World War II veteran. Great gentleman. A great hero. And he's 100 years old. And I want to be like you someday.  I want to be like all of you guys someday. That's great -- 100. And thank you very much.
