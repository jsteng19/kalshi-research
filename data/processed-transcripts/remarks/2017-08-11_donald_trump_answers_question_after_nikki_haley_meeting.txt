Thank you, everybody. We had a very good meeting. We talked about North Korea, as you can imagine. We're very much in agreement, I think we are very unified, and we have been right from the beginning -- this is something that has to stop. We all feel that very strongly.

I will be speaking to President Xi tonight, from China. And we've been working very closely with China and with other countries. That phone call will take place tonight. So if you have any questions, go ahead.

Well, I think as far as reassurance, they probably feel as reassured as they can feel. Certainly, they feel more reassured with me than they do with other Presidents from the past because nobody has really done the job that they're supposed to be doing.

And that's why we're at this horrible situation right now. And it is a very bad situation. It's a very dangerous situation. And it will not continue, that I can tell you.

So I think South Korea is very happy. And you don't mention Japan, but I think Japan is very happy with the job we're doing. I think they're very impressed with the job we're doing, and let's see how it turns out.

In order to reduce our payroll, absolutely. I think you know that. I think you know that.

We'll see. In fact, I was just speaking to the Secretary, and we're talking about coming up with an answer. When, Rex? Tell me.

By September 1st we'll have a response. But we have reduced payroll very substantially. Yes.

You know what I can say? Hopefully it will all work out. Okay? Nobody loves a peaceful solution better than President Trump. That I can tell you. Hopefully it will all work out. But this has been going on for many years.

It would have been a lot easier to solve this years ago before they were in the position that they're in. But we will see what happens. We think that lots of good things could happen, and we could also have a bad solution. But we think lots of good things can happen.

I think you know the answer to that.

I think you know the answer to that.

Well, we have some pretty strong opinions, but I would say that they are certainly not abiding by the spirit of the agreement. And I'd go, really, a further step, but I would say that the spirit of the agreement, Iran is not abiding by. Absolutely.

Well, we're going to make a determination, Peter, in a very short period of time as to Afghanistan. I've been looking at it. It's our longest war in history -- 17 years. That's unacceptable.

We will be making decisions, as you know, very well. And we're looking at that very closely. We talked about it a little bit today. We talked about Venezuela today also, by the way. Venezuela is a mess; it's a very dangerous mess and a very sad situation. But we talked about Venezuela also.

Well, I think General Kelly has done a fantastic job. He's a respected person, respected by everybody. Things have come together very nicely. And I have to say, I think probably -- and I've gone through this lot -- but I think very few Presidents have done what we've done in a six-month period. Whether its optimism in business, whether itÕs the stock market, whether it's picking up $4 trillion in value with companies and equity, whether it's all of the many things -- including a Supreme Court Justice, regulations being cut massively

We have, I think, it's 48 bills being passed in the legislature -- I'm talking about legislature, not just executive orders. I think few have done anywhere near what we've done, and we'll work now on tax reform cuts. We'll never stop working on, as you know, healthcare.

That's also working. And we're working on other things, including infrastructure. We're going to have a very big infrastructure bill. So I think nobody has done -- very rarely could I that anybody has done. I'm not sure that anybody has done what we've done in a six-month period.

But I think that General Kelly has brought a tremendous -- he's brought something very special to the office of chief -- I call him "chief." He's a respected man. He's a four-star from the Marines, and he carries himself like a four-star from the Marines. And he's my friend, which is very important.

I don't make anything of it. We should have had healthcare approved. He should have known that he had a couple of votes that turned on him, and that should have been very easy to handle, whether it's through the fact that you take away a committee chairmanship or do whatever you have to do.

But what happened, in my opinion, last week is unacceptable. People have been talking about repeal and replace for seven years -- long before I ever decided to be doing what I'm doing. Seven years they've been talking repeal and replace, and it didn't happen.

And not only it didnÕt happen, it was a surprise, and it was a horrible surprise. And it was very unfair to the Republican Party and very unfair to the people of this country. So I was not impressed.

Now, can he do good? I think so. I think we can do very well on taxes, cuts, reform. I think we're going to do well on infrastructure.

And things will happen with respect to healthcare, and I think things will happen maybe outside of necessarily needing Congress -- because there are things that I can do as President that will have a huge impact on healthcare. So, you watch. Stay tuned.

No, I have not. But I feel that they will be very safe. Believe me, they will be very safe. And if anything happens to Guam, there's going to big, big trouble in North Korea.

I don't want to say. That I just don't -- I don't talk about it. You know that. I'm not one that says we're attacking Mosul in four months. We do it or we don't do it.

Well, this isn't really for me, a trip. You know, I stay out of Manhattan because it's so disruptive to go to Manhattan. Now, I will be going on Sunday night. I have meetings on Monday and Tuesday -- going to Manhattan. But I stay out because it's so disruptive.

You know, all of my life -- I mean, my adult life, because I grew up in Queens, not in Manhattan. But during the time that I lived in Manhattan, whenever a President came in, it was very disruptive, and I think I'm probably more disruptive than any of them.

So when they have to close Fifth Avenue, when they have to close 56th Street and many other streets. So I'm here for that reason. We're doing a tremendous amount of work.

We're having, you know, large numbers of meetings and I'm on the phone a lot. But I'm here for that reason. I just don't -- I would love to go to my home in Trump Tower, but it's very, very disruptive to do.

Yes, we have a conference scheduled, we have a very important meeting scheduled, and we're going to have a pretty big press conference on Monday.

Totally. I can tell you, totally on the same page. And, Secretary, maybe you'd like to make a statement.

I think he responded to that, in effect, just a moment ago. And so I think what the President is doing is trying to support our efforts by ensuring North Korea understands what the stakes are.

We have many options for Venezuela. And, by the way, I'm not going to rule out a military option. We have many options for Venezuela. This is our neighbor. This is -- you know, we're all over the world and we have troops all over the world in places that are very, very far away.

Venezuela is not very far away and the people are suffering and they're dying. We have many options for Venezuela, including a possible military option if necessary.

We don't talk about it. But a military operation, a military option is certainly something that we could pursue.

Well, let me hear others say it. Because when you say that, I don't know what you're referring to and who is making the statement. But let me hear Kim Jong-un say it, okay? He's not saying it. He hasn't been saying much for the last three days. You let me hear him say it.

I don't want to comment because I think they're very different places, so I don't want to comment. But I support peace, I support safety, and I support having to get very tough if we have to, to protect the American people and also to protect our allies.

I don't think so. No. No, I don't think so at all. He's a good guy. He's just -- as you know, he's left for Colombia and various other places. He's been terrific. He's been a great ally of mine and a great friend of mine.

Yes, we are. Yes, we are. Very strong ones. They're already very strong. We are considering additional sanctions at a very, very high level. And probably, you could say, as strong as they get. Okay, thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you.
