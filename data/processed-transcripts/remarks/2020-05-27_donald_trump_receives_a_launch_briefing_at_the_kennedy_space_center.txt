Well, thank you very much. I just want to say this is a very exciting day for our country. We have been at this long and hard for three and a half years.

I want to thank Elon for -- who's been a friend of mine for a very long time, somebody I have great respect for. But this is 24/7 for you. You're always thinking about this. You're thinking about other things, too; you have plenty to think about. But this has been your baby.

This is the toughest one.

That's great. That's great. Well, it looks beautiful. We won't say congratulations because we have a long way to go, but it looks -- it looks magnificent.

And I just want to thank everybody in the room. Jim, you took it over from its infancy. And I was saying before, they had grass growing in the runways between the cracks, and now we have the best -- the best of the best.

And I want to thank again Vice President Mike Pence. He has worked so hard. This has been a labor of love, and --

Great job. Really, a great job.

But I want to thank everybody down here. And this is something the First Lady and I looked very much forward to seeing. And in a short while, that's going to be a lift off. I -- looks like we're probably going to make it weather-wise, Jim. Is that right?

That sounds very exciting, so I hope you all enjoy it. Thank you very much. Thank you for being here.

Jim, would you like to say something?

Please.

Thank you very much, Jim.
