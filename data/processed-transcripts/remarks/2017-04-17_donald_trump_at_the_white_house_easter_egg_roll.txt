I want to thank everybody. This is the 139th Easter Egg Roll -- think of it -- 139. It began a long time ago -- 1878 -- and we will be stronger, and bigger, and better as a nation than ever before. We're right on track. You see what's happening, and we are right on track.

So thank you everybody for being here.  We're going to do cards for soldiers in a little bit --  Melania and Barron and myself are going downstairs. We're going to sign some cards to our great troops -- the cards for troops, and we look forward to that.

And then we're going to come out and join you and enjoy your company for a roll -- a great Easter egg roll. And i don't know if we're going to be successful, but i know a lot of people down there going to be successful. I've seen those kids and they're highly highly competitive, that I can tell you.

I just want to thank First Lady Melania Trump. She's really worked hard on this. She has been working on this for a long time, to make it perfect and we wanted to keep it just right. So I want to just ask her to speak, but before she speaks I want to congratulate her on this wonderful wonderful day.

We're going to have a lot of people, a lot of people and they're going to have a great time. So Melania ,thank you very much and Barron thank you very much for being here. Thank you very much. Honey? First Lady Melania Trump. Thank you everybody/

Happy Easter and have a great great time, have a great day. thank you folks. Thank you very much. I'm coming down, I'm going to be joining you. Thank you very much. My whole family's here. Thank you.
