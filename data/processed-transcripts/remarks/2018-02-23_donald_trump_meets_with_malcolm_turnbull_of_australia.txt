Thank you very much. It's an honor to have Prime Minister Turnbull, Mrs. Turnbull -- friends of mine and friends of Melania for, actually, quite some time.

The relationship we have with Australia is a terrific relationship, and probably stronger now than ever before -- maybe because of our relationship, our friendship. But we're working on trade deals, we're working on military and protection, and all of the things that you would think we would be discussing today.

We have a big meeting set up in a little while, and we have a luncheon set up, also. And we have all of our representatives surrounding us and a lot of good things will come out of this visit. So, Mr. Prime Minister, we very much appreciate you being here. Thank you very much.

That's great. Thank you all very much.

I would. Yeah. We will be there. Great place.

We'll talk about it. Thank you.

I would, absolutely.

Been there. I've been there. I love it. Absolutely.
