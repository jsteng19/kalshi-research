Well, thank you very much. It's great to be with the President of Iraq, and we are obviously working on a lot of things together. We're working on military. We're working on ISIS. We're working on -- we have a whole host of very difficult things to discuss, and some very positive things also. And we've been friends, and the relationship is very good. And I just want to thank you very much, Mr. President.

Great . Thank you very much.

Well, we're talking about a lot of different things, and you'll be hearing whatever we do. But they like what we're doing and we like them, and we've had a very good relationship. I can only speak for my administration; I won't speak for past administrations, frankly. But we've had a very good relationship.

And we're down to a very low number. We're down to 5,000. So we're down to a very low number -- historically low. And we'll see what happens.

We'll see what happens because we do have to do things on our terms. We  --

That's right.

And we're also involved with them in their oil business, and that's always been very important from their standpoint and from our standpoint. So we have a lot of very positive things to talk about. But we are down to a low number, and we've been there for quite a while. So we'll make a determination.

Okay? Thank you all very much.

Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. We're going to do a news conference today. We have one other meeting, and then we're going to be doing a news conference right after this.

So, that'll be, I would say, within the next 45 minutes. Yeah, before leaving. We're going to be leaving in a little while. We've had tremendous success in Davos. And we'll be leaving in a little while, but we'll do a news conference -- a quick news conference. And then we head back. Some of you are coming on a very nice plane.

Okay? So I'll see you in a little while.
