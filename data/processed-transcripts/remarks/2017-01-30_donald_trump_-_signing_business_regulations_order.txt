So this is small business and this is regulation, and this will be the largest ever cut by far in terms of regulation. These folks are small business owners, and they're great people. They've been representative of the community, the small-business community. If you have a regulation you want, number one, we're not going to approve it, because it's already been approved probably in 17 different forms, but if we do the only way you'll have a chance is we have to knock out two regulations for every new regulation. So if there's a new regulation, they have to knock out two.

But it goes far beyond that. We're cutting regulations massively for small business and for large business, but they're different. But for small business -- and that's what this is about today, and this will be the biggest such act that our country has ever seen. There will be regulation. There will be control, but it will be a normalized control where you can open your business and expand your business very easily, and that's what our country has been all about. Should I sign it?  That's great. That's a big one.

Do you have anything to say to the press anybody. Would anybody -- would you like to say something to the press? Anybody? Become famous back in Syracuse.  Anybody?

Thank you.  Thank you, everybody, Mr. Vice President.

Thank you all very much. Thank you.
