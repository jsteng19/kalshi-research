Thank you very much.

Dou have the solution?

Let's say what it is.

Let's hear it. Go ahead.

And do you think you have a solution?

Okay, we'll take a look at it, good.

So did you know it's going to be so controversial?

Good.

Thank you very much.

Good. Thank you very much.

Okay. Very good. Thank you very much.

So where are you? What is your stance? It's a very important position you have. What is your stance on vaping e-cigarettes? How are you -- have you -- have you taken a stance?

That I put forward as a concept?

Yeah. Okay. Okay. Let me take a look.

And if you don't have high standards, you're going to have some very dangerous things happen?

That's what been happening, right?

Where people are using devices and other things that are not good. Right?

I see. That's a problem. Thank you.

Thank you. That is very nice. Thank you. That's really nice.

Well, thank you very much.

And what is your position, may I ask?

Good. Thank you.

Good.

Say hello to him.

Thank you. And say hello. Thank you.

Kellyanne, go ahead.

Thank you, Kellyanne. Mitt?

Thank you, Mitt. Well, this is a very big subject and it's a very complex subject. Probably a little bit less complex than some people think. But I'm here to listen and I have very divergent views. Who would like to start? Maybe I'd ask Alex to start and give us a little bit of a background on where we are and what we're doing and what we're thinking about.

Good. I do too. And I want to. How about you start? You had an interesting point of view early on. Where do you stand?

Well, one of the things we'll be talking about will be age, because age is a big factor. And we're going to be coming up with a number. I think we have to come up with a hard number at some point, so we'll be doing that. Let me now -- so, you had something very interesting to say before. Go a step further, please.

Yeah, please.

Well, a lot of people want to leave the menthol. They say, "Get rid of flavors but leave the menthol." I've heard that from a lot of people.

No? Go ahead.

So what are you suggesting? What are you suggesting?

Including menthol?

So, how many stores do you represent?

That's a lot of stores.

Now, were you higher in stores five years ago because of what's going on with the Internet? I mean, you're losing stores now to the Internet, wouldn't you say?

Would you say you're losing stores?

Not convenience stores?

That's good. That's a positive sign.

Right. That's right.

Okay. They are. And they're -- everybody. They're great people. And what are they saying about the vaping phenomena? What are they saying?

So then, representing all of those stores -- great people. What is your solution? What is their solution and your solution?

So, 21.

And what about flavors?

So are you saying -- would you not restrict --

So what would you do with flavors?

Go ahead.

Right. That's true.

So what would you do?

Because people can't afford that.

So what are you recommending on flavors?

Matthew?

Well, what would you do, Matthew? You've been working on this for a long time.

So what would you do?

Menthol.

What about menthol?

Yeah. Now, you're the head of JUUL.

So, what do you -- what do you say?

Right.

And that's regardless of age? It's just removed?

Who makes -- who makes the flavors, then? I mean, you're the biggest of the group. Who makes the flavors? Different companies?

And they continue to make flavors?

Right.

So what are you -- what are you saying?

Right.

They're going to lose their jobs?

They're going to lose their jobs?

Where is Reynolds?

You're still doing flavors?

So JUUL is not doing it, and they are both doing it. That's interesting, right?

Well, that's why I have you here. I mean, I'd like to see if we --

-- can do something for everybody, where everybody is happy. The one -- the one thing I see though -- and you watch prohibition, you look at -- you know, with the alcohol, you look at cigarettes, you look at all -- if you don't give it to them, it's going to come here illegally, okay? They're going to make it. But instead of Reynolds or JUUL or, you know, legitimate companies, good companies making something that's safe, they're going to be selling stuff on a street corner that could be horrible.

That's the one problem I can't seem to forget. I mean, I've seen it. You just have to look -- you have to look at the history of it. And now, instead of having a flavor that's at least safe, they're going to be having a flavor that's -- that's poison. That's a big problem.

So what are you saying?

But doesn't that happen --

-- let's say you enter -- okay, you just ended the flavors, right?

Isn't that going to be -- yeah. Isn't that going to be just sold, you know, illegally, or somebody is going to open up a shop in China and ship it in with flavors and you don't know what standard you're getting? Isn't that a problem?

And that's where the deaths are coming in. It's, really, not from your product, it's from product that's made illicitly. Right?

What do you call it? "China counter?"

What is it called?

And how bad are they?

How bad are they? Bad product, right?

In some cases.

I understand what you're saying, Matthew. I'm saying this: If you take out flavors, won't they just be made illegally -- the same flavor, but maybe unsafe?

What did she say?

Go ahead. What?

And with flavor or without flavor?

So why did JUUL end flavors?

Yeah.

Okay. I got it. I got it. Why did JUUL end flavors then? You're the biggest --

So you think flavors are dangerous --

-- essentially?

And yet you think we should have flavors?

And why is that?

What would you say about that?

So do you think you have it right, now? You're okay? You have -- essentially, you've gotten rid of the flavor?

So that's why .

I think we -- we're going to be doing that.

We're going to be doing that. Twenty-one, we're going to be doing that. Go ahead.

What do you think of the Senate bill?

Well, in some cases. Not all cases.

Yeah, please.

So, what are your suggesting, Sally? Do you have a suggestion?

How do you solve the counterfeit problem, if you do that? Okay, so they're not going to -- one of these guys are going to do it. They're all legit companies.

How do you solve the fact that it's going to be shipped in from Mexico?

Well, it's the problem. I think you have the same problem with drugs and everything else.

You mean they get addicted. And they didn't know about that.

Well, wouldn't you say it's a lesser problem than smoking cigarettes? I mean, they say that -- you know, the e-cigarettes, you stop smoking and that's better. You don't think so, Sally?

So it's a similar thing? Okay, how does that compare to, let's say, to normal smoking of cigarettes -- what you're talking about?

All right. Tony, go ahead.

Go ahead. Tell me about lungs. Come on. What do you think?

Yeah. Then we'll do that. Go ahead.

Well, what is your public stance on this?

You say it's a "new modern-age problem" that, five years ago, I guess -- when did this really begin?

I mean, really -- but, really two years ago --

Go ahead. Tell me what your stance is.

Regardless of age?

What about flavoring over 21 -- no?

But wouldn't they use it a lot less if they didn't have flavors?

Then you get back to the counterfeits, still. You still -- you're always going to have that problem.

If what? Disappear if what?

And yet the biggest company doesn't have flavors.

So why doesn't the biggest company --

All right, I got it. So, why doesn't the biggest company have flavors?

Sounds like Rockefeller. Rockefeller did that.

A flavor ban?

It'll destroy the business.

How does JUUL feel about that? He is saying you're going out of business. Basically, you're saying JUUL.

Why is JUUL not going out of business if he doesn't do flavors?

So what's your game?

So you really think flavors are very dangerous then, in terms of addiction and other things.

So if you're out of it and if we take them out of it, who's going to take your place? [Crosstalk.} Counterfeit. Counterfeit. No. You're going to have counterfeiters and that gets dangerous, right?

It's a little difference, right? Go on.

So, let me ask you this: the concept of letting states make their own decision. We talked about that the other day. What about that? A state. We put a 21-limit on it because everyone seems to agree on that. Right? Do you agree on 21?

You agree. So, let's say, 21. We put age limit: 21. What about the concept of every state decides?

And then they're going to go buy it and go back home.

But you know -- you know it's going to be a much longer-term solution. Yeah. Go ahead. Please.

So what do you like as a solution?

So what are your -- what is your solution?

I mean, your solution is just ban it, right?

No, no. But if you had the real solution -- just ban it, right?

All right. What's your solution?

My original suggestion.

Go ahead.

Go ahead.

You don't think it does help people quit?

A lot of people  --

And we're doing that -- we're doing that anyway, right? We're doing that.

What do you think?

So what do you like as a solution?

Yeah.

All right. Good. Thank you. Go ahead.

From American Lung, what is your recommended solution?

All flavors.

In other words -- including menthol?

That's a big -- that's a big statement.

That's a very big statement though, right?

So you want to ban all flavors?

Including menthol?

So how many children will do it if you get rid of the flavors?

How many children will do it? Let's say you don't have flavors.

So, now you have 5 million. How many children will do it if you don't have flavors?

Do you agree with it?

Will they put their own flavors in? Let's say you can't get flavors. Are they going to inject it with flavor? Will they put their own flavors in?

You can't do it?

It's an important issue, though. In other words -- because I've been reading about a lot of death. And the death, really, is from counterfeit, right?

It's not from JUUL; it's not from you.

Yeah, it's also using other things with it.

That's another discussion. That's another discussion.

Yeah. But it seems to be -- it seems to be counterfeit.

What was the most popular?

most popular.

So when JUUL took it off -- you had all flavors. You took it off. What's your business now, compared to what it was when you had flavors?

You -- has your business gotten bigger?

So your business grew even without the flavor?

Go ahead.

So why are you fighting for flavors?

What percentage of your business is e-cigarette?

Oh, the vape --

Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you very much. Thank you.

It's being sent over. We're going to take a very good look at it. Okay? Thank you. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you.

We're going to be announcing very soon. We did have an instinct but we'll be announcing. And we're going to continue this meeting for a little while.

It's going to be very interesting. We'll let you know pretty soon.

We want to -- we want to take care of our kids. We've got to take care of our kids. Thank you very much, everybody.
