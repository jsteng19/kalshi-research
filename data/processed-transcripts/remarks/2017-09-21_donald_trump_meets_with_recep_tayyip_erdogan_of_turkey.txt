Thank you very much. It's a great honor and privilege -- because he's become a friend of mine -- to introduce President Erdogan of Turkey. He's running a very difficult part of the world. He's involved very, very strongly and, frankly, he's getting very high marks. And he's also been working with the United States.

We have a great friendship as countries. I think we're, right now, as close as we have ever been. And a lot of that has to do with the personal relationship. So, President, thank you very much. It's a great honor to have you in the United States. Thank you.

Well, thank you very much, Mr. President. We appreciate it. Thank you all very much.

We'll be discussing many issues -- many issues.
