Well, thank you very much. And this is my second meeting with the relations -- great, great relations -- brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers of the abductees. And I can tell you that it's very much on my mind. I can also tell you for certain that it is your Prime Minister's primary goal -- there isn't a meeting that we have where he doesn't bring up the abductees.

And we will work together. You have a great Prime Minister. He loves this country. He loves you. And we will be working together to bring your relatives -- your daughters, your sons, your mothers -- home. And we'll work on that together. Okay, Shinzo? Their stories are very sad. And I must tell you, we've been hearing them and, in some cases, I've been hearing them for a second time -- because the last time we were here, we did this, and it was an honor to do it and meet these incredible people.

You may just briefly say a word to the media about your mother and maybe about your daughter. And they'll get just a little sampling of what we're talking about. But I can see why your great Prime Minister feels so strongly about it. Please.

Go ahead, please.

Thank you very much.
