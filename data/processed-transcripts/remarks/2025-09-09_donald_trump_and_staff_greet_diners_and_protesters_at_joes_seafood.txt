Thank you, everybody. We have a safe city now.

Can you imagine? We did it in 12 days, but now it's almost a month, we have a safe city. So, that's good. Enjoy yourselves, you won't be mugged going home, OK? Have a good time, everybody.

Yeah, I gave it to you.

Where's your family?

Oh, OK. Say hello, all right?

Have a good time, everyone. Don't drink too much.

C'mon, let's go. Move them out of here.
