Is this beautiful? It is so beautiful. Very proud of my friends. This is an incredible culture, that I can say. Very, very proud of my friends.

Thank you. This is the first time they've closed the mosque for the day. Is that true?

First time they've closed it. It's an honor of the United States, I think.

So, uh, better than an honor to me, it's, let's give it to the country. But it's it's a great tribute, thank you very much.

Is everybody having a good time? Doug?

There's plenty of good shots you're taking today.

Thank you very much everyone.
