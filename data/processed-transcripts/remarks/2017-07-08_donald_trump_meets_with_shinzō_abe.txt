Thank you very much. It's a great honor to have with us the Prime Minister of Japan. And we have many things that we've been discussing and that we will continue to discuss right now and later on this afternoon.

We made a lot of progress on trade and other elements. We're also talking, obviously, about North Korea, and the problem and menace of North Korea. And the Prime Minister is -- I will say this -- very, very focused on what's going on with respect to North Korea. So we will continue those discussions, and we appreciate you being here. Mr. Prime Minister

Thank you very much. Thank you.
