Mr. Prime Minister it's an honor to have you at the White House, and in Washington DC, and we very muchappreciate you being here. I know our people have made great strides in their conversations today and negotiations. And you're fighting ISIS and plenty of others, and you're winning. Ultimately you'll win. But we have great confidence in you, and again thank you very much for being here.

We will do that. Thank you very much.
