Thank you very much for being here. This is very exciting for me. I know so many people that are in your church -- the Latter-day Saints. The job you've done is beyond anything you could think of -- 180 countries, taking care of people the way you take of people, and the respect that you have all over the world.

I would love you to, while the media is here, just say a couple of words of what we just discussed -- all of the care and all of the giving that you've done. And to help people, in particular poor people, would be a good thing. And perhaps they will transmit that to different parts of this country and the world. It's so brilliant to hear it.

Well, that was very nice. I heard you were there. Formerly a great heart surgeon; one of the best in the world. And he decided to help even more people by doing what you're doing. So we appreciate that.

Thank you all very much. Appreciate it.
