Hard to believe. I've seen pictures. But it's hard to believe. When you're above it, in a plane, and to see the total devastation, to see no houses left. Not even the pads are left. It's incredible.

And I have to say that the work that FEMA, first responders, local government, law enforcement is doing is incredible. You just saw Michael, who actually was about the only person in this area that rode it out. He said he's never been so scared in his life. But it's -- he's never seen power like this; trees coming down left and right.

To see this, personally, it's very tough. Very, very tough. Total devastation. This is the Mayor, by the way. Come on over here. Come.

That's what it seems like to me. It seemed almost like a giant tornado -- a really wide tornado -- which is incredible.

More powerful in the winds.

So good. Thank you. Thank you.
