Mr. Chairman, it's a great honor to be with you. And I know that we will have tremendous success together, and we will solve a big problem, a big dilemma that, until this point, has been unable to be solved. I know that, working together, we will get it taken care of. So it's a great honor. Thank you very much.

I believe, too.

We will solve it. We will be successful and I look forward to working on it with you. It will be done. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much.
