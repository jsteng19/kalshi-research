Well, we're working on a plan, subject to getting massive border control. We're working on a plan for DACA. People want to see that happen. You have 800,000 young people brought here, no fault of their own. So we're working on a plan, we'll see how it works out. But we're going to get massive border security as part of that, and I think something can happened, we'll see what happens, but something will happen.

Yeah, they're doing a great job on power. They're doing a great job.... historically, there's never been anything like this, but the United States Coast Guard, FEMA, working along with Governor Scott, they've, really done an amazing job, and power is being turned on rapidly. The power companies... we have the largest assemblage of human beings ever in one area for power, and rapidly it's being turned on. So we're very happy with that.

The wall will come later. We're right now renovating large sections of wall, massive sections, making it brand new. We're doing a lot of renovation. We're building four different samples of the wall, to see which one we're going to choose, and the wall is going to be built. It'll be funded a little bit later.

Well, we want to get massive border security, and I think that both Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, I think they agree with it. But... so we met last night with, as you know, Schumer Pelosi and a whole group, and I think, we're fairly close. But we have to get massive border security.

Oh, I think he's on board. Mitch is on board, Paul Ryan's on board. We all feel... look, 92% of the people agree on DACA. But what we want is we want very, very powerful border security, okay? We're going down to Florida, we'll see you in Florida.

Ryan and McConnell agree with us on DACA. We're very much, we're very much on board. I spoke to them, yes.
