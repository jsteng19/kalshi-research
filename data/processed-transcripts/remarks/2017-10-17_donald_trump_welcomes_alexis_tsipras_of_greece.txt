Thank you very much, everybody. It's an honor to have Prime Minister Tsipras of Greece with us. As you know, Greece has gone through a lot over the last number of years, but they are doing a terrific job of coming back. And they will be back.

We're working with them on many different things. They're upgrading their fleets of airplanes -- the F-16 plane, which is a terrific plane. They're doing big upgrades. And we're doing trade with Greece, and we're going to have some meetings right after this.

We're having meetings with the staff. We're having a luncheon with the staff also. And we'll be talking about additional ways where Greece will help us and we will help Greece.

But we've had a long-time relationship with Greece. They have been great friends and loyal friends and allies. And we look forward to our discussion today. Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister.

That's true. That's true.

It's my honor. Thank you.

Obamacare is virtually dead. At best, you could say it's in its final legs. The premiums are going through the roof. The deductibles are so high that people don't get to use it. Obamacare is a disgrace to our nation, and we are solving the problem of Obamacare. Okay? Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you.
