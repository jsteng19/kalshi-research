Well, thank you very much. It's a great honor to be with President Al-Sisi, a friend -- a great friend -- of Egypt. And we have very special things happening. Our relationship has never been stronger. And we're working with Egypt on many different fronts, including military and trade. And whatever else you can work, we're working. And we're getting along great, and it's an honor to be with you again.

Thank you very much.

Well, I want to thank you, and I want to congratulate you on doing an outstanding job with respect to terrorism. I know you're working very hard on that. It's not easy. And you're at the forefront. But you've done an outstanding job, and I just want to congratulate you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.

We've done very well. If you look at various parts of the Middle East, you look at Syria, we've wiped out ISIS. We're in the very final throes. But you have really been outstanding. And we will work with you, and we will go all the way. Thank you very much. Great job.

Thank you very much. Thank you very much everybody.
