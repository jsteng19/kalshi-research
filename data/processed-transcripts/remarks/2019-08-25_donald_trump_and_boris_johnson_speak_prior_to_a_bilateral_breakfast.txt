Hello, folks. How are you?

Thank you, folks. Do you know who this is? Does everybody know? He's going to be a fantastic Prime Minister. And we're having very, very good meetings. So far, so good.

And that's a fantastic thing for us. We're talking about many different deals, but we're having a good time. As far as UK and the United States, we're working on a very big trade deal and I think it's going to work out very well. So thank you very much. See you later. Thank you.
