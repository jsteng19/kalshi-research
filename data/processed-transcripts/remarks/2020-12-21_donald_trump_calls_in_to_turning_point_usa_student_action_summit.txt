Hi, Charlie. How are you? That sounds like a big crowd of beautiful people.

Hi, Charlie.

I know you do. I know you do. I know it. Charlie, I appreciate it. I appreciate everybody there. I've spoken for Charlie numerous times, and we've always had a great time. And we are fighting, uh, really for the country because this election -- We won this election in a landslide. Uh, they dropped hundreds of thousands of dollars in each state.

It's all documented. The problem is we need a party that's gonna fight, and we have some great congressmen and women that are doing it. And we have others, some great fighters, but we won this in a landslide. They know it, and we need backing from, like, the Justice Department, and other people have to finally step up, but I just want to thank Charlie for the support.

Charlie's always been there. I watched you the other night with, uh, Steve Hilton who's a great guy too, and I will tell you, uh, we appreciate it, Charlie.

You're welcome. You take care of yourself. Have a good time. I'll see you soon, Charlie. Thank you, everybody. Bye.
