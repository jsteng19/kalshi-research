We have a very good relationship as to tariffs. And we helped Brazil and we want to always help Brazil. And the friendship is probably stronger now than it's ever been.

I don't want to make any promises. No promises.

Well, we'll have tremendous rallies. And we're doing very well. And we've done a fantastic job with respect to that subject on the virus. Yeah.

We've had tremendous cooperation with other countries and all over the world. And we've made it very, very tough. Very strong. Very stringent borders.

Say it. What?

No, I'm not concerned at all. No, I'm not. No, we've done a great job. Thank you very much.
