Thank you much. We appreciate it. President Putin and I have been discussing various things, and I think it's going very well. We've had some very, very good talks.

We're gonna have a talk now, and obviously that will continue. But we look forward to a lot of very positive things happening, for Russia, for the United States, and for everybody concerned. And it's an honor to be with you. Thank you. Thank you.

Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
