Thank you very much. It's an honor to be with President Buhari of Nigeria. We have many things that we do together, as you know, probably -- especially on terrorism and terrorism-related.

We also have a very big trade deal that we're working on for military equipment -- helicopters and the like. We have met before. We have developed a great relationship. And we look forward to our discussion today -- very important -- but again, especially as it relates to terrorism. And that's terrorism here and terrorism all over the world. It's a hotbed, and we're going to be stopping that.

Also, we've had very serious problems with Christians who have been murdered, killed in Nigeria. We're going to be working on that problem, and working on that problem very, very hard, because we can't allow that to happen. Mr. President, thank you very much for being here. Thank you.

We have very much decimated ISIS. Much has taken place over the last 12 months. But Boko Haram has been terrible. And how did you do with the young women that were kidnapped? How is that going?

A terrible problem. Mr. President, thank you very much, everybody.

Thank you very much everybody.

Yeah.
