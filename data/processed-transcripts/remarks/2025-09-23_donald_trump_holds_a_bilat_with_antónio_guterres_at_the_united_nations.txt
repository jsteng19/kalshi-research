Please.

You go ahead. That sounded very -- very nice. I loved that, actually.

Thank you.

It's true.

Thank you very much.

Thank you very much. It's always an honor to be here. We've done this before, and this was a little more exciting because of the escalator and the teleprompter. But these things happen. But I will tell you that your people have treated us with great respect. Our country is behind the United Nations, 100 percent.

I think the potential of the United Nations is incredible -- really incredible, it can do so much. So, I'm behind it. I may disagree with it sometimes, but I am so behind it because I think that the potential for peace with this institution is so great. So, I just want to thank you for treating us so warmly.

We very much appreciate being with you.

Thank you very much.
