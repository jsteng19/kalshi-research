Well, I can hear you, Chris. And I do have a question, and I think it will be quite an interesting one. The answer should be easy. How brilliant is Donald J. Trump?

That's right.

That's very nice, and I appreciate it. Maybe I'll ask a second one. I watched, believe it or not, CNN last night. And in watching it, I watched the town hall with Kamala. Now, let me ask you a second -- and it was not good. How brilliant is Kamala?

That sucks.

Don't say it. Don't say -- we don't want to hear. We don't need any more. We -- we're doing just fine. And by the way, Chris, JD is doing a fantastic job, could not be happier. He's really captivated people, and they love him. And we're leading by a lot, as you know, the early voting. We don't -- people don't want to talk about it.

I shouldn't be talking about it, but we're leading by a landslide, as they say. And we're very happy about it. And again, we're very happy with you, Chris. Take care of yourself.
