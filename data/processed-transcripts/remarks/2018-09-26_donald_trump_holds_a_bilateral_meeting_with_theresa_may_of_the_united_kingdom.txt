Thank you very much. It's my great honor to be with Prime Minister Theresa May. She's working very hard, like all of us, and doing a very, very good job.

We spent a lot of time together in my last trip to the UK. And I think that's when we could say we got to know each other. And it was like meeting after meeting after meeting. And I said, This is really good. And every meeting became better and better.

I will say that we're talking about a lot of different things today: trade, military, security, protection, all sorts of things. We have a myriad of things to talk about. I just want to say it's great to be with you and great to have you as a friend. Thank you very much, Theresa.

Yes.

Right. And we'll talk about them. And we'll come up with solutions and answers. Thank you very much, everybody. We'll see you at the press conference at five o'clock.
