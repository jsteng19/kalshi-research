Thank you very much. It's my great honor to have the President of Indonesia, a country that is doing extremely well -- and I would imagine a big part of that is leadership. Do you agree with that?

We've become friends, and we're going to be doing a lot of deals together -- trade deals. We have our whole trade delegation here, and we will start doing a lot of trading with Indonesia. We do very little business, relatively, now. But we are going to do a lot of business. So, Mr. President, it's a great honor to have you.

Thank you.

We'll get there. We'll get there. It's a place I'd like to go.

That's right. He did.

Thank you very much.
