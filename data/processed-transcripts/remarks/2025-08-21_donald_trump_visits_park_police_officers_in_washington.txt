What a nice group. Thank you. Thank you. Got to be very careful. You don't want to slip or fall, like somebody else I know. We don't want that to happen. Where are we going Margo, over here? Hello, everybody. It's great to be with you. You guys are doing a fantastic job, and gals, doing an amazing job and we appreciate it. And the numbers are down like we wouldn't believe, but we believe it. Where do I stand here?

Right where? OK. Hello. It's a healthy, attractive looking group of people. It's good. Well, I just want to thank everybody very much for being here. I wanted to do this. We've had some incredible results. The results have come out and it's like a different place. It's like a different city. It's the capital.

It's going to be the best in the world. We're going to do what you're doing with law enforcement and very importantly, also, we're going to physically do it. We're going back to Congress for some money and we're going to redo a lot of the pavement, a lot of the medians, a lot of the -- the graffiti is all coming off real fast.

It's going to come down real fast. We're working with Clark Construction. They're one of the big ones. They're the biggest here by far actually. And we're going to be not so much building, it's cleaning and fixing and redoing and putting brand new surfaces down on your roads and streets. And when people come in from the airport all the way to the Capitol, the White House or any place else, they're going -- they're going to say, boy, this place is spotless.

So we're doing that. Most importantly though, we're going to have a crowd of people that are going to be happy. I've received more phone calls from people in the last four days than I ever have. I've been here now four years plus. And by the way, I think we had about the best seven months, they're saying, that any president has had.

We've done a lot of work, we've done a lot of good work including the biggest tax cuts that you've ever had. I know you guys don't care about taxes, so you don't care about saving a little tax, but you saved a lot of tax actually, but we've had a great -- great period of time. But I've never received so many phone calls, thanking me for what we've done in Washington, D.C. from people that haven't gone to a restaurant in -- literally in four years.

And they said, what you've done, it's unprecedented because what they -- they said it was just unsafe. We couldn't do it, we'd go out and you'd see the stories, you'd read the stories, you'd see all of the things that are happening. And they said we just -- we couldn't -- we couldn't stand it, sir. And now I take my wife and my kids to dinner.

They -- one of them said he's gone out four nights in a row and he hadn't gone out for four years. So it's a -- it's a great tribute to you. And when I look at you people, I understand why, because there's no games, right? We're not playing games. We're going to make it safe and we're going to then go on to other places, but we're going to stay here for a while.

We want to make this absolutely perfect. It's our capital and I guess it used to be many years ago, say, but it's certainly not had a very good run and you got to be strong. You got to be tough. You got to do your job. Whatever it takes to do your job, you got to do your job. But the crime numbers are way down.

I'm looking at -- you saw some of the stats, they just read them out to me inside, the numbers that we haven't seen here ever, actually ever. And I think it's probably -- right now, to me, I feel very safe now. And I'm hearing people are very safe, but I know within two weeks it's going to be bam, it's going to be at a level that's even far superior.

So I just came -- I just wanted to thank you all. You're doing incredible. You're incredible people. You make the country run, frankly. You make the whole place run. We're going to have the best capital ever. We're going to have the -- it's going to look better than it ever did. Even at the White House, I'm building a ballroom.

They've been after a ballroom for 150 years, but they never had a real estate guy as a president. You know, I've done a lot of ballrooms and we're going to make this one the best of them all. But we're doing a real job as far. As the country is concerned, we're respected again. We had a country that was laughed at a year ago.

They would think -- they thought they couldn't understand what was happening and it's about leadership. But we had a country that was a dead country in many ways. Went to Saudi Arabia, I went to Qatar, I went to UAE, we came back with $5.1 trillion of investment in this country and we're over $17 trillion.

Now, a lot of you don't know what that means and nobody knows what it means because it's never happened before. In five months, because really, it's a five month even though we're here seven, but we started five months ago in terms of investment and we have -- because they see what's happened to our country, we're going to be over $17 trillion, trillion with a T, dollars of investment.

There's never been anything close. If we did $1 trillion in a year and we're talking about over a five-month period, maybe six months if you look at it, but over $17 trillion. We're building plants, auto plants, AI plants, all sorts of plants all over the country. I'm giving them the right -- Lee Zeldin has done a fantastic job.

We're giving the right to build electric plants. They become almost like a public utility because we have old grids. We have a lot of stuff that's old. We wouldn't be able to compete with China AI, and now we're totally leading the AI race and the artificial intelligence. It's a big deal and it's the hottest thing there is probably in 35, 40 years.

A lot of people don't know what it is. Just trust me, it's very hot, it's big, but they need massive amounts of electricity. They need more electricity than we have right now in the whole country servicing everything. In other words, we have to at least double it up to be competitive and to be leading. And we're more than doubling it up. And what I'm doing is I'm letting all of these very rich companies, and they've got nothing but -- they got a lot of money and they want to invest it in the United States.

And they're building big plants, but they're building electric plants with it. I said, you build your building and these are buildings that cost $30 billion, $40 billion, $50 billion, when you include everything that's inside, all the technology. I said I'm going to let you build electric plants to fire your own electricity and anything that you have left over, you sell it back into the grid.

So all of these big factories that are being built are building their own electric plants fired by oil and gas. They're not fired by wind, by the way, because wind doesn't work, but we won't say that. It destroys everything. It looks terrible. It's a very expensive form of energy and we're not doing wind.

We're going back to fossil fuel. I hope not too many of you people are going to be upset, but we have to go back to what works. We can't be foolish. But we are -- we're building massive electric plants all over the country. The companies are building and then they sell it back into the grid. But we're building numbers that nobody's ever seen, where auto plants, we have many auto plants going up, whereas during the last four years, as you know, we had like none.

People weren't investing here. So they weren't investing and they were leaving. But I just finish by saying this. So I was with the king of Saudi Arabia, I was with all of the NATO leaders a couple of weeks ago and they are putting up not two percent, but five percent. They said -- five percent of GDP. That's a lot of money.

They'll have trillions of dollars put up. They were putting up two, but they weren't paying it now they're putting up five and they're all paying it and they all said the same thing. They said, one year ago your country was dead. We never thought it was coming back. And now you have the hottest country anywhere in the world.

These are the leaders of other countries, the prime ministers and the presidents, all every one of them said essentially the same thing said we had a dead country and we were. We felt that way and we were. And this place was emblematic of it with the crime, the horrible crime. And you know, I watched these phony reports while we were on the way back, they weren't on the way back.

They were -- it was worse than ever just a short while ago. But now it's going to be -- I think now, right now it's better than it has been in years. And in a couple of weeks, it's going to be even far better than that. And everybody's safe now. Everybody feels safe and they're all coming in and people are now coming in. They're making reservations to come in and they want to be in Washington D.C. One of the things we're going to be redoing is your parks.

I'm very good at grass because I have a lot of golf courses all over the place. I know more about grass than any human being, I think, anywhere in the world. And we're going to be regressing all of your parks, all brand-new sprinkler systems, the best that you can buy, just like the Augusta. Mo, it'll look like Augusta.

It'll look like, more importantly, Trump National Golf Club. That's even better, but we're going to look -- we're going to have all brand-new beautiful grass. You know, like everything else, grass has a life. Do you know that, grass has a life? You know, we have a life and grass has a life and the grass here died about 40 years ago.

So we're going to be rebuilding all of your parks and it's going to happen fast. It's going to go up like a miracle. So you do the job on safety and I'll get this place fixed up physically and we're going to be so proud of it. At the end of six months, but let's say at the end of the year, this place will be maxed out in terms of beauty.

You'll have all new surfaces. You'll have all new medians. Everything is going to look beautiful. A lot of your signs are going to be taken down. They've been up for 40 years. They look like hell. They look -- they're barely standing up. They're falling off the -- off their holders and we're going to have all new everything.

And I want to just thank Doug for doing such an incredible job. You've been unbelievable. You're a popular guy. No, he's an amazing guy. He's an amazing guy. Everybody love -- we love you, and his wife is so incredible. But thank you very much. I appreciate it. And Pam, thank you very much. What a job. She's -- people don't realize -- they're going to see, she'll go down as the greatest attorney general we've had.

I really mean it too. And where's my Kristi? You're there. Thank you very much. She's been incredible and she can ride a horse like nobody. She gets on those horses. She rips those horses around. But I want to thank you very much. And Steve Miller, so fantastic. And Todd, Todd Blanche, who's been with me so long, and he's one of the best lawyers you'll ever find.

And we're having a lot of victories. I had a victory today. You know, they stole $550 million from me with a fake case and it was overturned. They said, this was a fake case. It's a terrible thing, but that's a nice victory. You know, I mean it's not bad. You know, we all have -- we all have our limits. But this was a terrible thing done.

It was a witch hunt and I've had more witch hunts than any human being, I think in history. And here we are, we're the president of the United States. So it didn't work out too well for them, but maybe now it's turned a little bit. These are very dishonest people we have to fight. We have to win because we have to win.

And you people are winners. And I just think it's really -- it's such an honor to be with you and we're going to make Washington D.C. great again. We're making our country great again. The country is very close to being great. When they say it's the hottest country in the world, they mean it. And this capital is, right now after four days, five days, it's at a level that you haven't seen in a long time, and it's all because of you.

So I want to thank you all very much. It's an honor to be with you and we'll always be with you. We're going to be with you for -- as long as I'm around, you're going to be treated -- there's nobody more important. And thank you all very much for being here. Thank you. Thank you very much. Doug, would you like to say something?

Thank you, everybody.

Thank you very much. Thank you. Pam, you want to say something?

So we have great hamburgers cooked by the White House, and we have pizza that I said, don't do it in the White House because we went to a place that makes the best pizza. So we'll concede, but we have a lot of it. So we're going to have some fun. We'll eat and I'll eat with you and we're going to have a little fun.

We're going to celebrate, but then we're going to get back to work and we're going to take care of these criminals. We're going to put them where they have to be. We're going to -- you're going to say, don't play around with us, don't play around with us. So let's go have something to eat. You're going to like the hamburgers.

Would you rather have hamburgers from the White House or pizzas from a good place, huh? I think you want -- oh, they want the hamburgers. Have a good time, everybody. Thank you very much. Kristi, thank you very much, darling. Thank you, everybody. Thank you.

Wait a minute. Give me that. Give me that mic. Come here, Judge. I didn't see you. Judge Jeanine is here. She's unbelievable. Oh, we have Leo. Leo 2.0. Whoa. Judge, I didn't see you over there. It's lucky I spotted her. It's lucky I spotted her. I would have been in big trouble. And Leo, you know, Leo 2.0. We love Leo. He's a great prosecutor, that's for sure.

You know, they both started off really as law enforcement and top lawyers and judges and law enforcement. And that's how they became famous. They went into show business and everyone thought, gee, were they real, but they were the real deal. And you're both doing great. Thank you very much. Pam, do you want to -- do you want to say something, Jeanine?

Thank you, honey. Thank you.
