I just wanted to thank our friends, our great friends. These are very troubled times in the Middle East. We see what happened just recently, yesterday in Syria. Horrible, horrible thing. Unspeakable.

But I want to thank you both for being at the White House, and we're gonna have some great interesting discussions today, thank you very much. Okay thank you very much.
