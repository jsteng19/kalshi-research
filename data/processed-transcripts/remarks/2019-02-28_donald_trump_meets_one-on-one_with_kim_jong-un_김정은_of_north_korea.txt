Well, thank you very much, Chairman Kim. And it's great to be with you again, and I'm sure, over the years, we'll be together a lot.

And I think we'll also be together after the fact -- meaning after the deal is made. We had very good discussions last night at dinner, and the pre-dinner was very good. And we have a lot of great ideas being thrown about. I think, very importantly, the relationship is, you know, just very strong. And when you have a good relationship, a lot of good things happen.

So I can't speak necessarily for today, but I can say that this -- a little bit longer term and over a period of time, I know we're going to have a fantastic success with respect to Chairman Kim and North Korea. They're going to have an economic powerhouse. I've been writing about it; I've been talking about it. I think it's going to be an economic powerhouse, and it's something I very much look forward to helping with, because with a little bit of help -- in the right location, in the right place -- I think it's going to be something very special.

Please. I have to say, very much from the beginning, that speed is not that important to me. I very much appreciate no testing of nuclear rockets, missiles -- any of it. Very much appreciate it. And Chairman Kim and I had a great talk about that last night. I'd let him say what he said if he'd like to, and if he doesn't, he doesn't have to. But we had a very good talk about that last night.

And, again, I am in no rush. We don't want the testing, and we've developed something very special with respect to that. But I just want to say I have great respect for Chairman Kim, and I have great respect for his country. And I believe that it will be something, economically, that will be almost hard to compete with for many countries, it has such potential.

Okay? Would you like to say something? I'm finished, yeah.

Good? Thank you all very much. We're going to start a discussion now with our teams, and thank you all very much. Appreciate it.

We're going to see. We're going to see. No rush.

No rush. No rush. There's no rush. We just want to do the right deal. Chairman Kim and myself, we want to do the right deal. Speed is not important. What's important is that we do the right deal. Thank you all very much.
