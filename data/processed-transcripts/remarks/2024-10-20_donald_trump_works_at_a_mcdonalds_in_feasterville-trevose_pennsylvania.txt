Thank you.

Hello, everybody.

My first day at McDonald's. I'm looking for a job. How are you? Hello, President Trump. I'm Derek Giacomantonio. I'm the owner. Oh, well, that's a good owner. Must be a wealthy guy, huh? Thank you very much.

Well, I'm looking for a job, and I've always wanted to work at McDonald's, but I never did. I'm running against somebody that said she did, but it turned out to be a totally phony story. So, if you don't mind, I want to work the french fry counter.

OK. How much are you paying me?

Hello, everybody.

Oh, good.

I think I should take --

Should I take off my jacket? I think so. The press wants to see this. How are you? There's a wealthy guy. He owns a lot of McDonald's, OK? That's great. Thank you. OK.

No, I think it's good. You want to do that? Yeah.

I like it all. I love my McDonald's. I like every ounce of it, everything, but I do like the french fries where I'll be working. I listen to Kamala. She said it was so hot. It was so hot. It was such a tough job. But don't you have a man that's been doing it for many years, the -- the french fries, right?

We're going to see -- I'm going to learn how to do it right now. Thank you.

Thank you.

Hi, everybody.

OK. Let's go.

Very good.

Yeah, come on -- come on over here.

Right.

Right.

OK.

That was it?

Right.

Right.

OK.

Wow.

Right.

Right. Right.

Oh.

That's pretty good, huh?

How long have you done this?

And you're very good at it, right?

I see.

Great.

I've had many of those.

I probably had more than you.

I might have had more, which is pretty sad when you get right down to it.

OK, yeah.

And you put them in through there, right?

What do you sell, mostly medium-sized?

What --what percentage would that be?

That's good stuff.

Very good. Very good.

It's a good job, isn't it, huh? Not bad, right?

You have a nice owner? Be careful, he's right there.

Be careful. Eight years, that's the end of that. We're going to the Pittsburgh game tonight, Pittsburgh Steelers. Should be good.

Yeah, it should be a good game. So, how long do they stay, in general?

So, you do the initial shake. You do a shake after that?

Right.

And you always keep them separate?

That's great.

Wow.

That's great. That's pretty good. I'll tell you. Are we allowed to give any to the fake news? Hey, by the way, did you see the crowds out there? For the fake news, they've never seen crowds like that. Take you a long time to feed them, wouldn't it? That's a lot of people. What do you think, Doug?

Got to say. Got to report back. There's something going on. Something's happening, Margo. Something's happened. That's not normal.

I do.

So, grab it? Grab it?

That's right.

That's right.

All right.

OK.

Two hands?

OK.

OK, right there. Yup.

OK.

OK.

OK.

Over here?

Yeah.

OK.

Yeah, let's make some more. Got about 10,000 people out there. That's a big crowd, huh?

I love McDonald's. I love jobs. I like to see good jobs. And I think it's inappropriate when somebody puts down all over the place that she worked at McDonald's. It was a big part of her resume that she worked at McDonald's, how tough a job it was. She specifically worked at the french fry -- where they make the french fries.

And she talked about the heat. It was so tough. She never worked at McDonald's. McDonald's just confirmed that again, by the way. She never worked at McDonald's. In other words, she's lying Kamala. This is a great setup, huh? So, what's the second handle, for a lefty?

That's -- so, you have lefties that are having that.

Yeah.

That's when you're busy, huh?

OK.

OK.

All right.

OK.

Good.

Can they have some? It looks good, huh? These are definitely fresh. The good thing, they're definitely fresh.

OK.

I pull it all?

OK. And I shake it a little bit.

OK.

To get rid of the oil.

All right.

Grab one while it's really hot. See if you can touch that sucker. I don't think so.

OK.

OK.

And we --

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

OK.

Let me give them extra salt.

OK.

Right.

OK.

OK. Where is that little thing?

You never even touch it, huh?

I was always wondering. Wow, that's pretty good.

OK. So, can I give it to these guys here? Take it.

Yeah.

Right.

OK. Got it.

I think so. Wow.

We'll do another one?

OK.

Let's do it. Let's do it.

OK.

It's cool.

Like that.

OK.

I like that.

Like that. Open it up, keep it tight. We got the salt on it. It never touches the human hand.

Nice and full.

Good? I'll do another one.

I'll grab it. OK.

Never touched by a human hand. Nice and clean. Of course, my hands are nice and clean. This guy is a good instructor.

Wow. I'm going to give a really big one so that -- so that they're just pouring out of there. How good is that, Margo? Here, Margo. Have them. She's been with -- she's been with me a long time. She's the only one who can afford to have them.

No, I think it's good. I think it's good.

Now, how about we bag them now?

Jojo, you're an expert at this, huh? Let's go.

I think so. Yeah.

So, we'll do that.

Because you know who's taking these, right? Mine. Do they ever ask for more salt?

Supposing we want some extra salt, can you just go like that?

What just happened? I love salt. Wait a minute. I spilled some. Just -- I'm very superstitious. Now, it's over the left shoulder, now I'm OK. Let's go.

Yeah. Fine. OK, put them in standing up, right?

You're an expert at this, huh?

How long have you done -- done this? How long have you been here?

Ten-plus, wow. All different jobs?

She's doing a good job?

She better, right?

She's beautiful.

Let's go.

Yeah.

How many -- how many would you put in a bag like this, like six, you're good? Six mediums.

Five.

Oh, good. Very good. Let's go.

Oh, I see. Now, I'm going to see -- oh, that's your customer out there.

Wow, that's pretty good. OK. Let's see. Can you believe this? Look at this guy. He's a MAGA guy all the way.

Here you go. OK.

Boy, that's a good-looking group. Hello, everybody. This is not a normal situation, is it? How are you? What a good-looking family.

How did you produce those good-looking kids? Give me -- oh, they look like the wife. They look like the wife. How are you? Nice to see you. That's great. Thank you, man.

Thank you very much.

Thank you.

And there'll be no charge. Trump is paying for it. Is that OK?

This -- oh, you going to have some extra stuff.

This is -- this is all on Trump.

I'm allowed to do that, right?

Huh?

It better be. It's going to be the best you ever -- I made it myself.

That's their order. Thank you, man.

Thank you. Thank you. Have a good time. Have a good time. That's --

That's great, isn't it?

How cute is --

OK. Next car?

Do you like them both at the same time?

Hello. How are you? You're a good-looking guy.

We love you. Come here, man. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. I will. I promise.

Thank you very much. That's --

That's on me, OK?

Have a good time. Thank you very much.

I'll see you -- I'll see you at the White House. Thank you. Thank you very much. Hello, fellas. Come on. We have another order coming up.

I mean, that's thousands of people. That's --

Hello. How are you? What a beautiful woman. Look at her beautiful child, the whole thing. It's like the perfect-looking person. That's good. That's --

That's a compliment. Thank you, darling.

Thank you. Hi, Mom.

Look at Mom over there. Thank you very much. Thank you, darling. You have a great mom. Good or great?

That's right. She knew what to say. Thank you very much.

Thank you, darling.

Wow. So nice.

OK. These are nice people we're meeting here.

OK. Got it.

There is -- look at this guy. I'm not going to mess with him.

You look fantastic. Hello.

How are you? Your new baby?

How are you?

How are you? So, this is compliments of me, OK?

Here you go. Have a good time.

Don't eat too much, right?

Thank you, man. You take care. Thank you, honey. Have a good time. Thank you. It's cute. This is fun. I could do this all day. I wouldn't mind this job. I like this job. I think I might come back and do it again, actually.

Look at that. Look at that. How are you?

Nice to see you. Hi, darling. How are you?

You're not ordinary.

You are not ordinary. I can see.

Thank you.

Thank you very much.

So nice.

Thank you very much. Yeah, I took a bullet. That's right, I guess.

When you think about it, I guess that's right.

Thank you very much. Beautiful wife.

Yes, go ahead. Go ahead.

Thank you very much.

Great honor.

Have fun. Isn't that nice?

Both of them?

OK. Hello, everybody.

I'm having a lot of fun here, everybody. Look at --

Look at the fake -- look at all the fake news over there. Hello, everybody.

And you know this is compliments of Trump, OK?

Yes.

Oh, we'll -- we'll keep it good.

We're going to make it better than ever, OK?

Thank you very much.

Compliments of Trump.

Have a good time.

Thank you over there. How you doing?

Have a -- have a good time.

Nice to see you. Bye, darling. Have a good time. Thank you, honey.

How good are these people?

I'm going to take plenty.

I'm going to definitely have french -- french fries for the plane.

Have you seen the people over there? That is thousands of people.

That's great. How are you? Nice to see you.

This is my guy. Great -- great cinematographer.

Not enough. I want more. I want more money. No, I'm big. I'll tell you what, it's a great franchise, it's a great company, and they've been very, very nice. And -- and, you know, if you look at really what's happening -- look at the crowd over there. Look how happy everybody is. They're happy because they want hope.

They need hope, and that's what we're doing. That's what we're going to give, much more than hope.

We're going to make -- we're going to take hope and make it fact.

Now, I have worked at McDonald's. I've now worked for 15 minutes more than Kamala, OK? She -- she never worked here. I've now worked 15 minutes more than Kamala. So, it's good.

I worked at McDonald's.

I'm going to say -- why? Because she's lying Kamala, that's why. Why would she lie? She shouldn't lie about it. McDonald's confirmed four times now she never worked -- she never worked here. But that's -- let's not talk about that. It's an amazing business. It's an amazing country, and we're going to make America greater than ever before.

We're going to do it. And it's companies like this. Look at the enthusiasm. I mean, that's thousands of people over there. They go miles back. That's incredible. So, look at that.

We'll be at the Pittsburgh game tonight, and we look forward to it, and it should be a good game. And, yeah. Good team. They have a great coach, Pittsburgh, great coach. And we'll see how it is. Going to be an interesting game.

Well, this is a great job to take at the beginning, and it -- it requires expertise. I'm going through the french fry stuff. It's a whole -- it's a whole big process, and it requires great expertise, actually, to do it right and to do it -- and to do it fast. Yeah?

Well, I do appreciate it maybe a little bit more, yeah. I -- I --you take it for granted. You say, give me french fries. I'll never forget this experience, OK? Now, I know how to do it, and it's very good. But you know what, it's beautiful. It's clean. It's really nice. You never touch them. I always figured somebody stuffs them in with their hand, and I don't like that.

And they don't do it that way. They -- you never touch them. It's really great. So, I want to thank you all for coming out, and we're going to see you soon. We'll see you at the next stop, and then we'll see you later on at the game.

I love Pennsylvania. I went to school at the Wharton School at -- at Penn. So, I love -- I love Pennsylvania, always have.

They have a Trump store?

I'd love to go. I don't know. If Secret Service could work it out, I'd go there. How about that? Can we do that? Can we go to the Trump store? They have a Trump store.

I don't know. People open up Trump stores all over the country, and they're beautiful. It's two blocks down, they say.

Check it out.

I'd -- I'd do it in two seconds. They have Trump stores all over the place. I get nothing out of it. You know what I get? The presidency out of it. That's all I get. Anyway, I love these people. They opened up the Trump store, they do great, and that makes me feel good. Thank you, all. We're going to take a look at the Trump store.

If Secret Service can do it, I'm doing it. I like the idea. We have plenty of time.

I don't know. What do you want? Do you want something while you're there?

I'll tell you what, how about if we gave you some french fries, all right?

Are you a -- that's sort of a bribe, but I think a bribe for a buck is OK, right? I'm going to get you some french fries. Somebody come up here and take them.

Let's get them some french fries, OK? This is for the fake news. These guys don't get any. They're too -- they're nice and warm and comfortable, right? All right. Good. Give me a couple more on that. Oh, you're very stingy with that product. Look at that. She's a good worker. You want to have that. That's the kind of people you want to have at work.

She gave them one french fry for 30 reporters outside.

Two in a bag, yeah.

Two in a bag.

We'll throw them out the window. We'll go.

Are you having a good time today, everybody? It's pretty good, right? Pretty good. No, a lot of people look forward. They kept saying when are you going to McDonald's? And I said let's do it. So, that's it. And we have the owner, and we have a man that's a friend of mine, that's a great guy. How many McDonald's do you own?

Yeah, yeah, but -- well, don't they go well? I know you're in the health club. I thought you -- what you do is you eat McDonald's and you go to the health club.

It works actually pretty good. Thank you, darling. That's good. Here you go. It's still happening. There's -- there's plenty of them in there for you, OK?

You want to move them back? Yeah, you.

Here you go.

I don't know. I'm doing very well. We're leading by quite a bit. She has no fracking. She's never -- never -- she's going to -- she's going to have no fracking. That's going to cost Pennsylvania 500,000 jobs and the revenues untold -- untold.

I think just by being myself. I want to be myself. All I want to do is be myself. They know what they're having. We have the best economy ever. We had the strongest borders ever. We had a military that knocked out ISIS in a few weeks as opposed to years, which they were thinking it would take. We beat ISIS in literally record time, very quickly and decisively.

And we did a great job. But we had the greatest economy ever. We had the best border ever.

Well, I always like to be conciliatory, but sometimes confrontation is important. And as an example, when you negotiate with other countries when they've been ripping you off for years because our country has been ripped off for years and years with -- with other countries and by other countries, even our friends.

And we've changed a lot of those trade deals, and we're going to change the rest. But we're going to bring -- we're going to bring jobs back to our country.

Yeah, sure, if it's a fair election, always. I would always accept it if it's -- if it's going to be a fair election. We're leading in all the polls now. We're leading in every swing state, and we're doing well. And it's -- no, I don't think so. I don't think so. In fact, they just had an RCP, said we're 93.

2 percent chance of winning. I think that's pretty good. So, we'll see.

We'll see. Those are pretty good odds. I like that. I like that. I'll take that right now, right?

So, thank you very much.

Who -- who are you with?

CBS. Are they the ones that did "60 Minutes?"

Are they the ones that changed her answer to make it positive?

Well, it's the same thing. OK.

Unifying? I think she's the most divisive person I've ever seen.

And she lies about her job applications, and she -- she's -- she's told some horrible lies, but she's a very divisive person. And I think it shows up in the polls. Yeah. I think I'm the one that brings everyone together. And we had the greatest economy we've ever had. We had the best job numbers ever.

We had the best border ever. The Border Patrol, by the way, for those that haven't heard, the Border Patrol a couple of days ago gave us their complete and total endorsement. They said, "Trump was the best president we've ever had," and they said, "She was the worst we've ever seen at the border." She did -- the job she did on the border -- and that really breaks our country apart.

They allowed -- they allowed -- they allowed so many people into the country, 21 million people, 13,000 of which were murderers, released from prisons all over the world. We can't have that. Thank you all very much for coming. Thank you very much. Here you go. Thank you.

Thank you. Grab some before you lose them.

He's my kind of guy. Do you want ice cream? I'll get you some ice cream. Everything working good. You're doing a great job. She's doing a good job?

Thank you, everybody. So, we'll see you at the next stop, but I hope you're going to grab that crowd because they say it's about 10 -- how many, 10,000? How many, TikTok Jack? TikTok -- tell me, how many hits do we have on TikTok? Ten billion views. And that's TikTok Jack. He's become -- actually, he's become very, very famous.

Yeah, Bibi called me this morning, and he's obviously got things going well. He -- he will call me on occasion. I think he likes to hear what I have to say. Yesterday morning and a couple of -- couple of days before that.

I can't tell you that. That I can't tell you. That -- it wouldn't -- it would be very inappropriate, but they're certainly in a better position. And fortunately, they didn't listen to Biden and to Harris. You know who Harris is, right? Kamala. They wanted to -- they didn't want him to do this. And, you know, Israel is much safer now than it would have been if they hadn't done it.

So, they -- they did not listen to Biden or Harris, OK? So, we're going to -- we're going to the next stop.

Well, I think this. I think these people who work hard. They're great. And I just saw something, a process, that's beautiful. It's a beautiful thing to see. These are great franchises and produce a lot of jobs, and it's great. And great people working here, too. Really, really good people. So, yes, ma'am.

It's Kamala's birthday? She's 60 years old? Yes, I would say happy birthday, Kamala. She's turning 60.

I think I'll get her some flowers. Maybe I'll get her some fries, right? That might be -- I'll give her -- give her some McDonald's. I'll get her a McDonald's hamburger. No, it is her birthday. That is true, right? Happy birthday, Kamala. Happy birthday. See you later. Bye. Thank you, everybody.

This is a strange place to do a news conference. Wasn't that a strange place to do a news conference? I want to thank you very much for the use of your beautiful store. It's essentially a store. And that's great. So, you know about the Trump store down the block? It's nice. Are we going to be able to go there?

Oh, 30 minutes. That's not down. That's a long way. We'll pay our regards, right? Good job. Thank you very much. How long have you had it?

I see. So, it's a good location.

Are you going to be able to grab the 10,000 people outside and maybe -- that's a lot of people, right? You got to say, that's impressive, isn't it? Very impressive. Thank you, all. Who are you with, NBC?

Oh, CBS. You mean the home of "60 Minutes?"

They did a bad thing. They got caught. They got caught with their hand in the cookie jar, as they say. That wasn't good, "60 Minutes." Don't worry, they won't put this on. I -- have a good time. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Derek.
