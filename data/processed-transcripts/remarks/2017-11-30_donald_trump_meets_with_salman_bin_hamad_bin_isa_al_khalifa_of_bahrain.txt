Well, thank you very much. It's my great honor to have the Crown Prince of Bahrain in the Oval Office. We're doing a lot of business. They're buying a lot of things. I heard $9 billion is thrown about. That's a very nice trip and we appreciate it.

We've had a long relationship and a great relationship, and it will only get better. I can tell you they've been, and you have been, a great friend. And we appreciate it very much, and we appreciate you being at the White House.

It's a great honor, believe me. Thank you very much. Thank you, everybody.

He's here. Rex is here.

Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you.
