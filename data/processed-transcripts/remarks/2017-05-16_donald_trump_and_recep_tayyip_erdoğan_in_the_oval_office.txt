It is a great honor to have President Erdo_an from Turkey here. We are going to have long and hard discussions. I know that they will be very successful. We've had a great relationship and we will make it even better. So we look forward to having very, very strong and solid discussions.

We're going to have lunch in a little while and we're actually be making a statement right after this in the Roosevelt Room. Thank you very much. Thank you.
