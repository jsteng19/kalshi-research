It is really great to have my friend, President El-Sisi with us. We've really been through a lot together, very positive, lately, and helped us so much with Aya and the release of Aya, and the American public so appreciated that. And I want to thank you, and I want to thank you General. Very, very much appreciated. We have some very important talks going on with Egypt, and you have done a tremendous job under very trying circumstances, and safety seems to be very strong.

So we appreciate that and congratulations on really doing a terrific job. Thank you.

I agree . Again, I want to thank you, and I will get to Egypt. We will absolutely be putting that on the list very soon, and this was really very much unscheduled. We wanted to say hello to each other, and you're able to come here last minute, and I appreciate that. That's very nice. And again we have a fantastic relationship with Egypt. Once again, we were not having such a good relationship with previous administrations, but we have a very, very strong one and we appreciate what you're doing.
