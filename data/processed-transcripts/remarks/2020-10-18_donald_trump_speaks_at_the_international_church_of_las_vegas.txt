Well, I want to just say this is a great honor, and you are something special, very special.

A little rough around the edges and that's what's beautiful, and you did it, I'll tell you. I go to many churches, and I love going to churches but, uh, this has been my favorite, and we'll be back many times, I will say that. But, uh, the both of you, really the job you do is incredible, and I know you've had a rough time in terms of this city.

This has been a tough place, but the job you've done to get people back is really very special. I want to thank you.  I will only say this, we are with you 100%. We are, uh, telling you you better get out because we have a group on the other side that doesn't agree with us. You understand that? We happen to be right, so get out there on November 3rd, or sooner, and do your thing.

But, these are two very special people. Your families are very, very special, and you have great talent up there, and thank you all very much. That's great talent. I know talent and you're great talent. Thank you all very much. Have a good time. Have a good time. And, Dan, good luck. You know who that is, right?

You know who that is, Big Dan.

Dan, go out there and win, Dan. You're going to win. Have a good day.
