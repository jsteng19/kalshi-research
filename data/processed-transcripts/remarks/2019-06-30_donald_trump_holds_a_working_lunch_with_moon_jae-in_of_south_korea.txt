Well, thank you very much, Mr. President. And I will say that we had a great meeting just now. And we're talking about some economic balance and a lot of other things. And I think that it will work out extremely well. I've been told that Kim Jong Un would like to meet, and that -- it looks like they're in final stages of working out a -- just a very quick meeting because I'll be at the DMZ anyway, the border.

I'll be at the DMZ. And I look forward to saying hello to him if that all finally works out. I guess there's always a chance that it might not, but it sounds like the teams would like to have that worked out. And so that's good. But we have had a great relationship, you and I. And I appreciate that. And I know you appreciate it, because the United States has been doing a very good job for a lot of countries.

And I don't know if a lot of countries appreciate what we've done, and that's part of, perhaps, part of the reason I'm President right now and other people aren't. But many of them do. And I think you do. And I look forward to spending the day with you. I look forward to spending time with you. I look forward to going to the DMZ, which I've wanted to see for a long time.

And it's going to be very interesting. And I know the press will have no interest in that, but we will -- I will find it very interesting. So, thank you very much. I appreciate your hosting us. You hosted us so beautifully. Thank you. Thank you all very much. Thank you.
