Well, thank you very much. It's a great honor to have President Rajoy of Spain. He's somebody highly respected -- highly respected -- in this country.

We have a very, very close relationship with Spain. And, Mr. President, it's an honor to have you in the Oval Office. It's an honor to have you at the White House. And we're going to be discussing trade and other things, and we look forward to doing it. And, Mr. President, thank you very much.

President Rajoy and myself will be speaking outside, and we'll take some questions. I assume you're going to be asking me only about Spain. We love Spain but they have a lot of other things on their mind, I have to tell you.

And again, we have a terrific relationship and that will continue and be stronger than ever before. So I'll see you outside in a little while. Thank you all very much.
