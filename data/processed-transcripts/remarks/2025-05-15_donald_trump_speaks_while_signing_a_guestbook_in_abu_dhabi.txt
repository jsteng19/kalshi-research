This has been a great visit with a great man, great country. You see what's going on, a tremendous investment in our country, and the development you just looked at, AI+, it's going to be purchased through mostly companies based in the United States, and, uh, Jensen was here, the whole group. I think it's going to be something very special.

It's a -- it's a massive project, and it's going to be bought through the United States, largely. And it's an honor to be here, and the last four days have been really amazing. I think they've been amazing. But it shows you where a country can go, and I want to thank all of my team, Howard, Scott, everybody.

Uh, they've done an amazing job. So we'll be leaving tomorrow, as you know. Almost destination unknown, because we're getting close. Could you be here? Could you be there? But probably going back to Washington, D.C. tomorrow. Some of you are going to be traveling with us, and I'm going to sign the guestbook now, and, uh, we appreciate you've been 00 actually, you've treated us 00 the media's treated us very fairly, maybe because you're with me. I don't know.

But they've treated us very fairly. It's been an amazing trip. I don't think there's ever been anything like it, and it's a great honor to be with you tonight.

Thank you.

Perfect.

Thank you very much.

Thank you very much, everyone.
