Almighty God: Our sons, pride of our nation, this day have set upon a mighty endeavor, a struggle to preserve our Republic, our religion, and our civilization, and to set free a suffering humanity.

They will need Thy blessings... For the enemy is strong. He may hurl back our forces, but we shall return again and again; and we know that by Thy grace, and by the righteous  of our cause, our sons will triumph...

Some will never return. Embrace these, Father, and receive them, the  heroic servants, into Thy kingdom... And, O Lord, give us faith. Give us faith in Thee; faith in our sons; faith in each other; faith in our united crusade...

Thy will be done, Almighty God. Amen.
