Thank you very much, everybody. It's an honor to be with the Prime Minister of Australia, Prime Minister Morrison. And we've just gotten to know each other, and so far, so good, I have to tell you. I think it's going to be a great relationship. And we certainly anticipate having a fantastic relationship -- always -- with Australia.

I know you've done a fantastic job in a very short period of time. You've done a lot of the things that they've wanted over there and that's why you're sitting right here. And so I congratulate you.

But it's an honor, and we will be with Australia and you all the way.

Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Appreciate it.

I don't know. Not particularly. I don't know.
