Well, last time, I saw your coach, he said what about a waiver. I said: what are you talking about, a waiver? He said, some of these guys could play in the NFL, you could play for the Yankees, you could play for the Mets, you can play basketball, you could play whatever, but you have to serve a long time.

So what we're doing now is you'll -- you'll go out and you'll make a fortune, and after you're all finished with your professional career, you'll go and you'll serve, and everybody's thrilled. That means you can go out and you can do whatever you want, and it probably gives the coach no reason to ever lose another game.

That's what you said.  He'll never lose a game. So I want to congratulate you. You were the man, you -- you told me about it, and a few of the guys were shouting how about the waiver Mr. President? How about the waiver? So good luck to you guys.

contest. Thank you.

I want to congratulate you. You had a hell of a season. But it's only a great season, you know, you know what has to happen today. Otherwise you wouldn't call it a great season, so you better go out there and play hard. But now if you -- if you get that talent and get -- got whatever it takes, and it takes a lot, you can go into professional -- and we're doing it, one reason, very important, because it's so great for the spirit of our country, when they see Navy and Army, and all of these great institutions going out there representing our country, I view that as a big positive.

So for those of you that can do it, you can now do it, and coach, you can have   Good luck everybody. Go out there. Good luck.

I like that.

Can I play today?

Good luck, fellas.
