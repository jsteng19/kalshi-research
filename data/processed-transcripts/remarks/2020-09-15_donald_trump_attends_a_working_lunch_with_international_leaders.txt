It's a great day, it's uh, an incredible day, very historic by any means, and it's an honor to be involved with it. We have the media. You know, Prime Minister Tony Blair is here, and it was a great honor to have you here, Tony, thank you. Fantastic job, very fantastic job. I just want to thank everybody at the table.

What you've done is something that nobody thought could have been done, certainly not within 20 years -- they thought maybe something like this way out into the future, but you did it -- you've done it in a time period that nobody thought possible. So I just want to congratulate everybody at the table. It's been uh -- it really is the best word, the only word you can really say is historic.

It's a very historic deal, and will become more and more historic when other countries join, which they're going to. I can tell you from personal knowledge -- five, six, even seven are, uhm wanting to get in and get something signed really quickly.

So it's something that we should all be very proud of, and thank you all for being here. Fantastic job. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much everybody.  Thank you very much. Please.
