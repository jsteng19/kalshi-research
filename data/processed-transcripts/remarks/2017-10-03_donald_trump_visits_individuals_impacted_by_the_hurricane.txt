Well, what I see is an incredible, an incredible job done by FEMA, done by the Coast Guard, the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Marines. I think that the job of the first responders has been something that I've never seen before.

What FEMA, what the people that got here even before the hurricane have done... and the governor is with us, and your mayor with us also, and governor. What's happened... what's happened in terms of recovery, in terms of saving lives, sixteen lives, that's a lot, but compare that to the thousands of people that died in other hurricanes and, frankly, we're not nearly as severe.

I just have such respect for FEMA and for all of the people who got here early and what they've been able to do. Governor, you may want to say something.

Congresswoman, would you like to say something.

Thank you.

It's getting fixed. The power grid honestly was devastated even before the hurricanes even hit. Then the hurricanes hit and they wiped them out. A lot of generators have been already brought to the island. Most of the hospitals are open,  at least partially open, but most of them now are open.

Again, the job that's been done here is really nothing short of a miracle. It's been incredible. And I appreciate... and this is the major from this very important area, and Mr. Mayor I appreciate your efforts. I appreciate what you are doing.

Thank you very much everybody.
