You've never seen so much paper on a President's desk.  That's because we're negotiating lots of deals for our country, which will be tremendous.

And I just want to introduce Brian Krzanich, who's the CEO of Intel, a great, great company. And Brian called a few weeks ago and said, we want to do a very big announcement having to do with our country, but also having to do mostly with Arizona, and the jobs and the great technology that will be produced.

So this is Brian. And, Brian, why don't you say a few words and maybe also talk about the product you're going to be making. It's amazing.

Thank you, Brian. And you have something over there. Show a little bit about the new product.

That's great, thanks. Do you have any questions for Brian? I know you have none for me, so how about --  --

Great thing for Arizona. Unbelievable company and product, and we're very happy. And I can tell you the people of Arizona are very happy. It's a lot of jobs. Probably the investment -- what are you saying, your total investment will be what?

Thank you, all.
