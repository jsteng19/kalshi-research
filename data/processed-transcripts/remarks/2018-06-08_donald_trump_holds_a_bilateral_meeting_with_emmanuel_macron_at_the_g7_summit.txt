That's right.

Well, I wanted to thank you too Emmanuel. We have, really, a very good relationship, very special. A lot of people wrote a couple of things that weren't quite correct, a little bit accurate, perhaps. We have little test every once in a while when it comes to trade.

The United States has had a very big trade deficit for many years with the European Union, and we're working it out, and Emanuel has been very helpful in that regard, and something's going to happen. I think it'll be very positive.

We also have a very positive really a while ago on NAFTA, so this is turning out to be a good thing, but we had a very, very good meeting on NAFTA with Justin and his representatives. But I want to thank you. It was really helpful today.

I also want to congratulate you, because I'm reading what's going on in France. You've got great courage. You're doing the right thing. Nothing's easy, but what you're doing is the right thing, and it's a wonderful country. It's a special country, and you have a special president. That I can tell you Thank you very much.

Thank you.

We haven't brought that up.
