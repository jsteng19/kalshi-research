It's a great honor to have President Abbas with us. We'll be having lunch together, we'll be discussing details of what has proven to be a very difficult situation between Israel and the Palestinians, and let's see if we can find the solution.

It's something that I think is frankly maybe not as difficult as people have thought over the years, but we need two willing parties. We believe Israel is willing, we believe you're willing, and if you both are willing, we're going to make a deal. So, I want to thank everybody. I want to thank Rex Tillerson for being here. Rex, do you have anything to say?

Thank you, Rex. And, Vice President Mike Pence, sitting right here, has been a longtime supporter of peace. And, certainly, peace between the Palestinians and Israel. And, Mike, would you like to say something?

He's made great progress, hasn't he? He's doing a great job. And Rex is doing a fantastic job, also. Thank you all very much. Thank you.
