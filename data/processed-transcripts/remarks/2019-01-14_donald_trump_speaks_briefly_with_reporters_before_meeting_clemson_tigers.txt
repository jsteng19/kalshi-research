I like it all. I like it all. It's all good stuff.

It's great American food. And it'll be very interesting to see at the end of this evening how many are left.

I like them all.

If it's American, I like it. It's all-American stuff. So -- but it's good stuff. And we have the national champion team , as you know Clemson Tigers. And they a fantastic game against Alabama, and they're all here, they're right outside the room, and I think we're going to let you see them.

But I'll bet you as much food as we have, we have pizzas, we have 300 hamburgers, many, many french fries, all of our favorite foods. I want to see what's here when we leave, because I don't think it's going to be much.

Reason we did this is because of the shutdown. We want to make sure that everything is right. So we sent out, we got this, and we have some wonderful people working at the White House, they helped us out with this.

And I will say the Republicans are really, really sticking together. It's great to see, because we need border security. We have to have it. We have to have it. No doubt about it. Should have happened 30 years ago, 20 years ago, 10 years ago, and it's gonna happen now. It's gonna happen now. Thank you very much everybody.

Enjoy your food. Good stuff. Grab one. Grab one, fellas. Grab one.
