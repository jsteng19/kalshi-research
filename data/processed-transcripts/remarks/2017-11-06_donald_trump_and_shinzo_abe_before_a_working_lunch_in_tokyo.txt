Thank you.

Shinzo, thank you very much. This has been an absolutely great two days. You've become a very close friend, as everybody knows. And to be with you and Madam was just really something very special. To have the privilege of playing golf with you and Matsuyama was great. He's a great champion and a great celebrity, even in our country -- a great celebrity.

But the time that we spent together has been very fruitful. We will be now discussing trade. We'll be discussing North Korea. We'll be discussing military. I appreciate all of the purchases you're making toward military equipment and other things in the United States. And, you know, we make the best, and you will get the best service.

But this has been a very, very special two days. So, on behalf of the United States of America and all of my representatives, I'd like thank you and all of your representatives. And we will continue to have a relationship that's even better than we have ever had with Japan. Thank you very much. Thank you.
