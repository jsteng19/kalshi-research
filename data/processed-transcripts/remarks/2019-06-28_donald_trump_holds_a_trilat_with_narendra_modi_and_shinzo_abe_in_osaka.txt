Well, it's a great honor to be here and with my two very good friends. We've gotten to know each other very well over the last short period of time. And you and I are going to be meeting separately after this meeting.

But, Prime Minister Modi, thank you very much. And congratulations on your great victory.

I should say congratulations, really, to both, because Shinz≈ç also had a great victory -- a great electoral victory. So, congratulations to both of you on the tremendous numbers, tremendous success, and tremendous popularity. You're doing a great job for your countries. And I'll see you in a little while.

I look forward to it.

We'll be talking trade. We'll be talking about trade.

We have a lot of things to talk about. It will be very positive. We have a lot of very positive news.

We have a lot of things to talk about.
