Thank you folks.

You're doing great. This is something. Well, I saw this. It's hard to believe, actually. And I guess the fact that we went very early helped; it helped a lot of people. But we saw things that you wouldn't believe. Here it is. You saw the same thing. Kathrine has done an incredible job and the Governor has done an incredible job, and we really appreciate it. We really appreciate it.

Thank you very much. I appreciate it.

They've done an incredible job, but I want to thank FEMA -- all of our people from FEMA. They've been very quick acting, Kathrine.

Let's go take a look. Thank you, fellas. Thank you.
