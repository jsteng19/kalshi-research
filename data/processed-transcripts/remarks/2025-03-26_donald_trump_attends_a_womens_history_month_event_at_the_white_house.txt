Well, thank you very much. Ooh, that's a lot of good-looking people there. This is great. It's a great honor to be with you and I want to thank everyone and welcome you to the most spectacular place, the White House. It's just an amazing place to live and to work in. And I've seen a lot of good places, but believe me, there's nothing like this.

It's just very special and it's great to have you here to celebrate Women's History Month. That's a big deal. And today, we honor the legacy of incredible women like Betsy Ross, Harriet Tubman, Susan B. Anthony, Clara Barton and Amelia Earhart, all legends, and their extraordinary courage and patriotism and devotion propelled our nation to glory and to greatness.

They are great women, many great women and thank you for the vote. You were very nice to me. The women, we set every record. We loved it. We loved that vote, but we're delighted to be joined by some of the pioneering women who are making history in our own time, a woman that's just absolutely incredible.

I can't tell you enough about her. She ran my campaign. We kept winning, winning, winning and then we did well where she won Florida by record numbers. And I said, the second time, I said, well, just keep running Florida and the big one was stolen from us, so I said we better get her for number three. And we won in records.

We won every swing state. We won by millions of votes, the popular vote. We won everything. We won the districts at 2,750 to 500, 507 or something like that. And we just won so big and her name is Susie Wiles. Where are you, Susie? And she was just named by one of the very prominent media groups. I won't mention it because I cannot stand the people, but she was just named as, and it's true, the most powerful woman in the world.

Seriously. That is crazy, huh? Her father was a great, Pat Summerall, a great announcer, really great football player. And an announcer for the NFL for like 27 years. He really got the NFL. He did pretty well with the NFL. He got him off to a very good start, didn't he? But he was great, but she's got those same traits.

So thank you very much, Susie, great job. Also, we're going to go to somebody that's really the rage right now. She's the youngest ever White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt. Karoline, look at you, huh? They said, sir, sir, she's just too young and I said, I don't know about that. She did awfully good because she did it during the campaign and she was awfully good and she's been amazing.

She just did another one just a little while ago. She looked at Susie and looked at me. I don't know. I think I'm ready, sir. How old are you, 27, right? 27. I said, you're not too young and she's knocking them dead. Everyone's talking about you. Thank you very much. Great job. And we have somebody else who's like a rocket ship, the counselor to the president.

She served me well. I'm going to miss her, but we'll see a lot of her anyway. I hope it's on friendly basis because I've got to be very concerned because she's going to be the new US attorney for the District of New Jersey, Alina. Where's Alina? Alina Habba. Alina. Alina Habba. Thanks, Alina. She's going to be great.

I'll tell you, she's going to be great. She's a great lawyer and lives in New Jersey. And I said that sounds like a good combination. Everybody wanted that job. They're all looking for the job and I said, wait a minute, doesn't Alina live in New Jersey? Yeah, I think Alina is going to get that job. So congratulations, Alina.

That's fantastic. I'm also thrilled to say that we have more women in our cabinet than any Republican president in the history of our country. And joining us today is a woman I've known a long time. You talk about strong women. This is a strong woman. Remember, they were saying he doesn't like strong women?

That may be true. But if that's true, I'm in deep trouble because I'm surrounded. I got the strongest women and this is a beautiful, strong, wonderful woman, Attorney General Pam Bondi. But yesterday, she was talking about these guys that like burning down cars and plants and everything else. And I was watching her on television.

She said, I'm going to get you, we're going to find you and you're going to suffer. And I say, man, I don't want her after me. And it's amazing, the attacks have gone down very, very precipitously. Pam is fantastic. Thank you very much, Pam, really amazing. Along with a woman who was given a very hard and difficult problem, the cost of eggs, this was the problem.

The cost of eggs. Eggs were through the roof. You got to see the Biden chart, it's like a rocket ship. And Trump is like this way, but I gave Brooke the secretary of agriculture. And I didn't know it. I didn't know it, she studied that in college. I didn't know that. I was going to give it to her anyway.

It didn't matter that she studied, but it sort of helped, right? But she came in and she lowered the cost of eggs by almost 50 percent in three weeks. Someday you're going to tell us that secret. I want to find out, but the chart looks great. It's Biden like this and then we're like this. But we also, by the way, we lowered energy costs really tremendously.

Energy is way down. Cost of gasoline is way down. The cost of groceries, a word that I used a lot on the campaign. It's like an old-fashioned word, but it's a beautiful word, very descriptive word and the groceries are coming down, Brooke, at a level that very -- I mean, we're finally getting costs under control in our country and people don't like talking about it because it's so good.

It's so positive. I haven't seen one story on eggs plummeting by 50 percent, but someday they'll get around to writing it. Secretary of Education, she's trying to put herself out of a job. Linda. She's trying to put herself out of her job. She's moving education back to the states and she's doing it at a rapid rate.

And she's an amazing woman. I've known her also for a long time. She's been amazing; no matter where she's been she's been successful, including with her husband, building a tremendous empire. And Linda McMahon is very special. Thank you, Linda. Thank you. And it's getting praise -- by the way, the concept of moving education back to the states back to the mothers and the fathers, and you'd probably do it for less than half and you're going to have great, great schools.

You know, I say that in our country they have charts, and they rate the countries, various countries, and Norway and Denmark and Sweden and lots of places are rated at the top, and Finland. China is rated very high too. Tell me that's -- that takes the big problem out because if they can do it, that's big.

So, we can do it. And we're rated toward the bottom. We're at number 37, 38, 39 or 40 out of 40. So, we're just about last and yet we're first in one very nice category, cost per pupil. So, obviously, there's something wrong. We just have to repeat that, Linda, and everybody says, well, I guess it's time to do it and it's been that way for a long time.

And originally, we had it run by home states, and we never had that kind of a problem. But it's going to be -- Katie, it's going to be brought back again and Linda's going to do it. And I just say -- she said you basically want me to get out of government, don't you? I said that's right, do your job and get out.

But I promise I'll have something else for you, OK? I promise I'll have something even better for you, all right? But you're doing a job and we appreciate it. Also, a special man. He's got a tremendous majority. It's so easy, a majority of about one . I think he's the only man could do the job because everybody loves him, everybody respects him.

He's really smart. Really, he's so nice. People say is he smart? I said you have no idea. He's actually -- he's really nice because he's smart, he knows it's the only way you can live with it. Where is Mike? Mike? It's the only way you can do it. You've got -- he's the nicest guy. But in actuality, he's not a nice person.

He's ruthless . You haven't seen this guy when he gets angry, I don't want it, I'll ruin your image overnight. He is a phenomenal guy, a great speaker, Mike Johnson. Thank you very much. I'm just -- I don't know, is that good or bad for you? I'm not so sure. It's OK. He said whatever the heck you want to say is OK. First female Republican attorney general of Iowa and an early supporter of Trump.

And where's Brenna Bird? Brenna? Brenna, thank you very much. She's so popular in Iowa. She came out so early and I appreciate it very much. That's great. Alaska Lieutenant Governor Nancy Dahlstrom. Nancy. Thank you, Nancy. Thank you very much. You have a great governor too, by the way, Nancy. He's also tall.

He's seriously tall, I mean the guy is like seven foot two. He is a tall guy, but he's a great governor. I have a son who's tall like him and -- Barron is very tall. They're all tall, but Barron is seriously tall, right? So, anyway, say hello to him. He's a great governor. South Carolina Lieutenant Governor Pamela Evette.

Where is Pamela? Thank you very much. Good job you're doing. Great job, good and good luck with everything. I know it's big stuff, right?  Oh good. Thank you. Well, you have a great governor. Oklahoma Agricultural Commissioner Blayne Arthur. Blayne. Thank you, Blayne. Good, nice to see you. And so many other incredible women.

I'm going to make so many enemies because I'm looking here. I know every one of them and I'm supposed to say their names. I maybe will get to it, I don't know. It's a long list. For four long years we had an administration that tried to abolish the very concept of womanhood and replace it with radical gender ideology.

Maybe you heard something about that. They destroyed women's spaces and even tried to replace the word mother with the term birther person. A mother became a birther person. What's that all about? Then you wonder why they lost; they're trying to figure out why did they lose. I saw a congressman today for the Democrats.

He was having a big fight on television early this morning trying to make it so that really he thinks men should play in women's sports. He hasn't given that up yet. He was fighting like crazy. I said this guy is going to lose, he's going to lose badly. The whole party is still into that. They haven't learned and we don't want them to learn, frankly, we want them to keep fighting, let's not tell them.

Under the Trump administration, we're ending the Marxist war on women, and you had a war on women. And we're protecting women's rights, defending women's dignity and standing up for the American moms and daughters. So, many are represented here, great people in this room. American women have never had bigger champions than all of us in the White House.

I mean it's me, but it's the group of men and women. We have a lot of men that are like Howard, our head of commerce I see is here. What are you doing here, Howard? Oh, that's a good -- he's got his beautiful wife here. I was saying what's Howard doing here. There aren't too many men in this audience actually, but he's a big advocate.

And we're going to be making a -- right after this we're going to be making a big special announcement, Howard and I and Scott and a few of the people, on cars. We have Liberation Day in America. That's where we take back all of this money that's been ripped off from us for so many decades and we start a process, we're going to go with the tariffs on cars.

And as you probably have been reading, it's all over the place, you've been reading and seeing and watching car companies and every other form of company. They're pouring back into our country at levels never seen before. We're up to I guess close, Howard, to $5 trillion of investments already and there's never been that much per year.

We did that in a period of six weeks. There's never been any numbers like that. We've never seen -- they're all coming. They're all coming in, so they don't have to pay tariffs. It's very simple, because if you build your product in the USA, there is no tariff. On day one I made the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders, male and female.

So, is there anybody -- seriously, is there anybody that disagrees with that in this room? I was thinking maybe somebody from the press might raise their hand. I don't think so. There aren't too many people. You know, it's amazing. It's got to be like a 98 percent issue, right? So, what are they doing, Marjorie?

What are they doing? They're fighting for a two percent issue. That's good. Let them keep doing it. No matter how many surgeries you have or chemicals you inject, if you're born with male DNA in every cell of your body, you can never become a woman. You're not going to be a woman. And that's why last month, I proudly signed a historic executive order to ban men from competing in women's sports and it was very popular -- very, very popular.

We had a track meet, and it was so disparaging to great women athletes. I've known so many great women athletes. I gave Annika Sorenstam the Medal of Freedom here not so long ago, and these are unbelievable athletes. But it's so ridiculous -- they had a track meet and you heard me talking about a long distance track meet.

The man won by five hours and 14 minutes and 12 seconds. And I said this is not good. And you want to see worse? Take a look at the weightlifting records, take a look at the boxing, take a look at this -- the whole thing is ridiculous and frankly it's demeaning to women and you are superior to men in my opinion.

What do I know? You are, huh? I see you. No, they are superior. I've known it all my life and I'm not happy about it. I'm not happy . I also banned puberty blockers. Can you believe I'm even saying this. And the sexual mutilation of minor youth. Now who would think -- let's go back 10 or 15 years, if you ever heard a statement like that, you'd say what the hell is he even talking about, right, Brooke?

What is he talking about? Puberty blockers. But that's where we are, that's where we've come and we're ending it. We're sending it back to where it came from, oblivion, right? So, in the recent election, we did fantastically well with women. I kept hearing women don't like him. I said I think they do . You know who don't like -- fake polls don't like me, that's who don't like me. But we're setting records in so many of these cases and I was for women.

I was for the women, the suburban housewife where I stopped low-income housing projects from being built at a house next to you where people were being decimated. Their houses were being literally ripped up and destroyed and I stopped it, and we've stopped it again. We had to stop it again. I stopped at first term.

We had a great first term, a really successful first term. We had the largest increase in stock market value, 88 percent increase, in the history of our country. We gave you the biggest tax cuts. We gave you the biggest regulation cuts. We rebuilt our military. We gave too much of it away to Afghanistan, this character, I mean he gave billions and billions of dollars of it away to Afghanistan and maybe we'll have to ask for that back.

Although it's getting a little old now. They're getting a little old. We're building new stuff. But I will say that it was such an honor working with so many great women. I've worked with women all my life. I've always been ahead on that subject. I had women in my construction business putting up skyscrapers in New York 30 years ago, 35 years ago, long before it was in vogue, and they were phenomenal.

Every one of them was phenomenal. My administration listens to America's moms and that's why I recently created the Presidential Commission to Make America Healthy Again, and that's really caught on. That's really caught on. And Bobby Kennedy, by the way, is doing a great job. I think it's going to go down as another great choice.

And we just don't want to treat the chronic disease crisis. We want to prevent our children from getting sick in the first place and there are so many things that we are doing wrong. Something happened. If you go back 20 years, autism, think of it one in 20,000 children. Think of that, one autism. You see it all over, one in 20,000 children.

Now, it's one in 36 children. Now, what the hell is that all about? There's something out there and we got to find it. But can you imagine one in 20,000 and now it's one in 36, not 36,000, one in 36 children. And I see it. I see it all the time. And so there's something out there and we're going to find it. We're doing something really wrong and it might be very simple to even correct.

But we're looking very hard and Bobby's looking very hard and we're going to figure it out. And to further support our nation's mothers, I've signed an executive order to expand access to fertility treatments like IVF. That's Katie. Katie, where's Katie? Katie called. You're a great Senator from Alabama.

She called and she was like in a little bit of angst, right? She said, sir, we just had a ruling from an Alabama judge who said you couldn't have the clinic's IVF. And I was in my plane and she said, it's terrible. It's terrible. Friends of mine are virtually attacking me because -- they're not really. People don't talk about it necessarily and why should they?

But Katie called me up. She did such a great job. And she said, sir, you have to get on this right away. It's terrible. They're going to close up all the clinics. They ordered all the clinics closed and I said, so Katie, give me a quick definition, please, educate me in a minute or less. And she did. And I came out totally in favor of what all of these women wanted.

And I mean, it became our issue. We actually took it away, Mike, from the Democrats. They were late to the party and it was really, I give you a lot of credit. So thank you very much. Thank you, Katie. Great job. And I also signed an executive order to begin abolishing the Department of Education, as we said, but also to go back and do things with our school children that just hasn't been done in many, many years.

But the basic is reading, writing and arithmetic and we want to make sure that they teach English. OK? But I think we're not going to have a problem and you're going to see things happen, I think, on the education front, like nobody can believe. It's very exciting, very exciting. And so many of the states like Iowa and Idaho and Indiana -- by the way, unrelated, but Indiana, they just signed Honda.

One of the biggest auto plants in the world is going, Honda, a big, big company, would have never come here except for, let's say, the election. I like to say the election result. But let's give tariffs a little -- well, without the election result. You wouldn't have the tariffs, right? So I guess it's all about the election, Marjorie.

But one of the biggest anywhere in the world are building an Indiana big, big plant, and we have many of them going up. Many plants in other countries have stopped. They've stopped construction. One of them, right in the middle of construction. They're coming. They just signed a contract. They're going to build it here instead.

So you're going to see that at record -- just remember I told you so in 12 months from now. But on day one, we're ending the inflation nightmare that Joe Biden created and caused. But just by his spending, two things, his spending. But I think more important, he destroyed our energy policy and energy started going up, gasoline.

Any form of energy went through the roof. And then what he did to get it down a little bit, he went back to the Trump policy, everything, let them drill, let them -- they were very, very concerned and it was too late because that Jack rabbit had gotten out of the nest and it was too late. They really screwed us up in so many ways, how about allowing millions and millions of people to come into our country, open borders, people from all over the world, not South America, South America, but all over the world.

They came in from Africa, from Asia from all over the world, from prisons. The prisons were emptied into our country. I call them prisons and jails, prison being a slightly tougher term, but the prisons and jails were emptied into our country. The mental institutions and insane asylum, same thing. Insane asylum is mental institution on steroids, right?

I say I used to say, Dr. Hannibal Lecter, the great Dr. Hannibal Lecter is in a hotel room near you and the fake news back there. A lot of fake news here, by the way, fake news would say, why does he keep mentioning Hannibal Lecter? I said you know why, because we just won an election. We got a lot of votes because of Hannibal Lecter.

We don't want to have Hannibal Lecter in our country. So we watched what was happening to destroy our country and a woman, by the way, the head of homeland is doing, Kristi, is doing a great job, Kristi Noem. She's doing a great job. She's getting them out and Tom Homan, but Tom Homan and Kristi Noem, they're doing an unbelievable job.

She's tough. She might be tougher than Tom, is that pretty tough, right? I'd say Tom is central casting, but he says, I think she might be tougher than me. So we needed that because she's dealing with a rough group of people, millions and millions of people. 21 million people came in, but of that, at least 3 million are serious, serious criminals.

Many of them are murderers, 11,088. And of that number, about half have murdered more than one person. This is not going to end well. So we're getting them out in record numbers and we're having a lot of problems with the courts because the courts want to pretend they're president and they're not president.

They didn't get 80 million votes and they're not. They can't do that to this country. That's not their job. But we're getting them out in record numbers and it's going to save a lot of lives. We have some really bad people in this country, but you see the ones we're taking out, Tren de Aragua, the toughest of all gangs, MS-13, and we're getting them out.

So in just two months, core inflation has dropped to its lowest pace in four years. We've got it going. The groceries I told you about and energy of all kinds, gasoline that's fallen below now $3, $3 for the first time in years, since I was there. It's fallen below $3. We're going to get it down quite a bit lower.

That's going to bring prices still further down and people are going to be able to buy their groceries again and so important. And again, I want to just congratulate you, Brooke, what a job you've done over there with the eggs. I was in office for one week and I got this one article was so bad, that Donald Trump has caused a massive egg problem.

And I said, this is terrible -- and they showed it. It's like, terrible, but it was during his term that it went up, right? But they were hammering me. They thought they had us until I put you in that position. And I don't know what the hell magic wand you use and now they don't talk about it anymore. It's terrible.

Well, we have to talk about it. If they don't talk about it, we talk about it, right, Brooke? But what a job you've done. Now we need Congress to pass the largest tax cuts in American history and Mike is going to get that. And I think, now I think we can finally say one big beautiful bill, because everybody's there.

I spoke with John Thune, who's doing a terrific job also and the senators, and we want one big beautiful bill. Just put it all in that bill, and we'll figure a way to have it passed, right? We'll figure a way. But it'll be the largest tax cuts in American history. When you add that onto the fact that if they don't pass this, you will have the largest tax increase by far because the tax increase that I passed five years ago, the biggest in history, bigger than the Reagan tax cuts, what happens is that jumps back to where they used to be. So if you add that onto the other normal tax increases that the Democrats want to give, this would be the largest tax increase in history by 58 percent or more I guess, but 58 percent.

And I don't know how anybody can vote for a Democrat, but I know one thing that I believe the Democrats are going to be forced to vote for this bill. And then we have the very important continuation of debt. I don't call it a debt increase because we're not looking to increase. We want to just continue that line and we should call it, I think, from now on -- Mike, we're going to call it the continuation because that's what it is. That was thrown into our lap unnecessarily.

But we have it and it's fine that we have it. But I think we're going to get tremendous support even from democrats because otherwise they're voting for the biggest tax increase in history by far, by, I think, 38 points. And I don't think they're going to want to do that. So, Mike, I hear you're doing great on it. And we're going to have tremendous, tremendous goodies in the bag for women too.

The women, between the fertilization and all of the other things that we're talking about, it's going to be -- it's going to be great. We're joined today -- fertilization. I'm still very proud of it. I don't care. I'll be known as the fertilization president and that's OK. That's not bad. That's not bad.

I've been called much worse. Actually, I like it, right? I like it. Thank you. We're joined today by many of the women members of the House and Senate who make up so much and make this all happen. And I especially want to recognize the leaders of the brand-new Republican Women's Caucus, Senator Katie Britt.

Again, Katie, thank you. Thank you, Katie. Great job you do. And Representative Kat Cammack who just announced a new baby girl. That's great. I also want to say a driving force behind the effort to create a women's history museum. We're working very much with some of the women in this room. I'm not sure if it's been discussed specifically, but to create a women's museum on the National Mall.

And we have a great site. I'm very good at real estate . We have a great site, and Nicole Malliotakis is here someplace, where is Nicole? And she is really working hard on this one. This is a passion for you and you're working --

It's a big, beautiful -- she said it's going to be a big, beautiful museum. Well, it has to be. If it's for women, it better be big and beautiful or we're in trouble, right? But we're working on that. Also here -- I just have this list and they're incredible people, so I have to do it, otherwise I'll be run out of town.

I don't have the courage not to do it. Senator Marsha Blackburn. Marsha, thank you very much. So incredible, unbelievable talent. Senator Joni Ernst. Joni Ernst, where's Joni? Hi Joni. I owe you a call, I'll call you, OK? Deb Fischer just won a great race, Nebraska. Thank you, Deb. Great race, Deb. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith -- oh, we love Cindy Hyde.

Thank you, Cindy. She said, sir, could you do a rally for me? I said yeah, I'll do a rally for you. I get there, sir, could you do two more for me. I did. We did three and we blew him out, right? It was an Obama sycophant. We blew him out of the water, right, Cindy Hyde? So, thank you. And Senator Ashley Moody, congratulations.

Where is Ashley? Congratulations, Ashley. Also, representative -- and this one is tough, she's tough. Lisa McClain, she's tough and good. She's a good one. She's a real leader. Thank you. Great job, Lisa. Representative Stephanie Bice. Thank you very much. Thank you. Where's Stephanie? Thank you very much.

Sheri Biggs. Hi, hi Sheri, good. Lauren Boebert, great people. Monica de la Cruz. Monica de la Cruz. Hi Monica, good job. Julie Fedorchak, Fedorchak. Hi, Julie. Great, nice to see you. A person that is more experienced than anybody and she's still a young woman, very young, Virginia Foxx. Virginia. What a good woman, right, Mike?

A quiet woman, but she -- underneath that quiet facade, she's a tiger, Marjorie Taylor Greene. A highly respected woman, I tell you. Thanks Marjorie, great woman. Diana Harshbarger, Diana Harshbarger, where are you, Diana? thank you. Thank you. Good job with your son too. Thank you. Ashley Hinson, Ashley.

Thank you. Thanks, Ashley. Great, good job. Erin Houchin. Thank you, Erin. Thank you very much. Laurel Lee. Laurel? Thank you. Good. Good job. Julia Letlow. Good, nice seeing you, Julia. She's done a great job. Anna Paulina Luna. Anna, good. Nice to see you. Another quiet one, Nancy Mace. Hi Nancy, great, great job.

And Nicole, I said hello to you and your museum, and you get that going and we're going to back it 100 percent -- unless the women here would rather not have a -- is anybody not in favor of a women's museum in this room, please? It's OK. I could see some -- maybe they want to save a couple of bucks, right ? No takers.

OK. You're all set, you have it then I guess. I guess -- I sort of thought that was going to happen. Celeste Maloy. Celeste, thank you. Great job, great job. Carol Miller, great election. Thank you, Carol. Great job, Carol. A friend of mine, a beautiful person, a beautiful family. It's like she's got children, they're all supermodels, male and female, handsome husband, Carol Mary -- Carol Mary Miller.

Mary, how's it going? OK? Good. Mary Miller is a really spectacular person and a great congresswoman. Thank you very much.

22nd grandchild, look at her, it's one of the most beautiful families, really starting with you. It's just a beautiful family. So, you have a long way to go, Kat, come on, you have to get going. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, great election you had, great election, great job. Oh, Maria Salazar, where is Maria?

She is strong. She is a tough one, but they love her. We all love her. Thank you. Another one who's really good, I got her -- got to know her very well along with Mike. We were having some talks, and she really knows what she's talking about. She was right 100 percent Victoria Spartz. Thank you, Victoria.

Thank you very much. And Beth Van Duyne, who's fabulous. Hi Beth, thank you. Thank you very much. It's such a great group of people and there's others in there. I'm going to be -- no, I'm going to get killed. I know you're for me and I'm for you. That's true. Can you imagine, there are others, I'm seeing and looking at others, I'm going to be in trouble.

That's the problem, when you do that, you leave a couple of them out they never speak to you again. They never forget. Now we need congress to pass the largest tax cuts, and we are going to get that done. And we're joined today by so many people that are just so great, and we are going to have a little bit of a celebration after this is finished in one of the outer rooms, they have some stuff for the women.

Much better -- we did this for men. And you know, it's very unexciting having a day for men. I stood up here, it was like I just -- I reduced the speech from 10 pages to about two paragraphs . It was boring, it was boring as hell to tell you . Throughout our history, strong tough visionary women have defended our flag, strengthened our communities, explored new frontiers and expanded the American dream for all of our children -- all of our children and all of our people.

Now patriotic American women, like those in this room, are helping lead our nation into the Golden Age of America. And that's what we're calling it. This is the Golden Age of America. We want to do things that nobody thought were possible. You know, had I done it the more traditional way, which I actually did, but we won't talk about that.

But had it been the, you know, four plus four as opposed to four, let's see how bad they do and then we get another four at numbers too big to rig, we call it, we have to go out too big to rig. They tried, but it was too big to rig. Had we done it that way. It wouldn't have been nearly as important or nearly as historic.

It's much more historic. It's a much more important presidency. And frankly, because of how bad they were, we're able to do things that we could have never done if it were traditional. I don't think, Marjorie, we would have ever been able to have done the things we are doing now. You see what we're doing with the colleges and they're all bending and saying, sir, thank you very much, we appreciate it. And they are -- nobody can believe it, including law firms that have been so horrible, law firms that nobody would believe.

And they're just saying where do I sign. Where do I sign? Nobody can believe it and there's more coming. But we really are in the Golden Age of America, and I think you're going to see it more and more as we go along together. We're beginning our country's greatest era and we're building a future that will be stronger, safer, healthier and happier than ever before.

And you're really going to be the leader I think, really, I think you're going to be the dominant leaders and you have a lot of them in this room politically. But just the fact that you're here and the fact that you're with us is so important. There is nothing like strong, beautiful, wonderful women. You have the heart.

You have the whole spirit. You're amazing people and it's an honor to be with you and we're going to work together and we're going to make this the greatest age in the history of our country. Thank you. Thank you, Mary. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much, everybody.
