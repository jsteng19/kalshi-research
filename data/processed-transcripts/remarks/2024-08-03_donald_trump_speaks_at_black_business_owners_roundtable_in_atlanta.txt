I think you're the last one to make it to

And what about the fact that they want you to go to all-electric trucks within a short period of time, and it doesn't -- it doesn't work because of many things, but it doesn't work. What about that?

Right.

And the economy just is not the same and inflation has been eating your heart out, hasn't it?

Yeah.

So sad. Go ahead.

Thank you very much.

Right.

A big difference.

Right.

Well, if we -- we get in, and hopefully, we should, everything -- all indications are we will, your business is going to be better than ever. We're going to get it turned fast. They're regulating people out of business right now, and I'm hearing it from everybody.

It's a big problem. And the biggest problem is the inflation still. How is inflation affecting your business?

And does the customer pay for the inflation or do you pay for it?

Huh?

Yeah. Sort of both probably, but you pay for it.

Yeah.

We'll get it back. We'll get it back. We'll be back where we were, but better. Thank you. Bruce, go ahead.

It's a big deal.

Right.

Right.

Yeah.

They're people with good jobs.

And good money, but they still can't afford to have the American dream, can they?

And four years ago, that's what they had. They had the American dream.

I got it.

And they can't get the money anyway. Even if they want to pay the high interest rates, and you can go up to 10 and 11 percent, they can't get the money anyway. We were at 2.4 percent. Now, you're at 10 percent, 11 percent, but you can't get the money. So, I guess, you're much higher than that. It's terrible.

Thank you very much. Very nice.
