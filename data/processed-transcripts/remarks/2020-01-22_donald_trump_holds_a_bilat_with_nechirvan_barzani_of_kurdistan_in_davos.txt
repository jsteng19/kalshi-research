Well, thank you very much. It's great to be with President Barzani of Kurdistan. And we have a meeting scheduled. For a long time, we've wanted to meet. We've worked together very well. As you know, we left Syria, from the standpoint of the border, and that's worked out great with Turkey. It's worked out far better than anybody ever thought possible.

They have the so-called "safe zone," and I appreciate everything you've done to keep it as safe as possible. But, very importantly, as you know, we have the oil. And we left soldiers for the oil, because we took the oil and we're working on that. And we have it very nicely secured. We also have thousands of ISIS prisoners.

We've taken over 100 percent of the caliphate. And it's a very interesting region, but we've had a tremendous relationship. And it's great to be with you. Thank you very much.

Please. Would you like to say something?

Right.

Thank you very much. Really great.

Okay, thank you very much. Appreciate it, everybody.

We do have a plan, and we think it's going to be handled very well. We've already handled it very well. CDC has been terrific. Very great professionals. And we're in very good shape. And I think China is in very good shape also. Thank you very much.
