Well, thank you all very much. we're at the SAFE station, which has become -- all over the country, people are coming here to see what they're doing here in New Hampshire, and we're talking today about drug addiction and drugs and opioids and all of the problems, and I think what I'm going to do is ask the chief, who has done an incredible job. He was here before the election. I said I was going to come back, and I came back.

So I'm going to ask chief just to say a few words about it, because it's really quite incredible.

Thank you very much

I also want to thank the governor and the mayor for being here and, perhaps, Governor Sununu, you'd say a few words.

As you know we are getting a big response in Congress for helping with opioid and drug use that's literally taking place as we speak. So a lot of money's coming in and unfortunately, it's more than just the money, it's competence and some of the things they do.

So I just want to thank you there and... and governor and chief and everybody that's here, maybe especially these incredible people that are working here and seeing, every day you see.. every you see some pretty tough things, right folks? Anybody wanted to say a little bit about what you do here? Go ahead.

And you save a lot of lives. I've been reading a lot about it. You save a lot of lives. So a lot of people coming from all over the country to check out exactly what you're doing Chief.

Thank you all very much. Thank you.
