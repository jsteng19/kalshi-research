Well, thank you very much. We have invited the nation's -- our great nation's newly elected governors. And some really terrific people. They're going to do a wonderful job. All of them had great victories. Some had very, very outstanding victories, in terms of the percentage of victory, and even surprising.

We have some real stars in the room. And they became stars because of the way they handled themselves. I could almost say -- I think I could pretty much say, Mike, most of them have become stars, if not all. Because you won. Winning is a wonderful thing.  So I thought what I'd do is go around the room, and maybe you could just introduce yourself; say hello.

We have some Cabinet members, too. You can quickly introduce yourself, because we've all seen you guys. But I'd love to -- maybe say a couple of words. And it's an honor to have you all. Kristi?

Great job. Great job.

That's right.

That's right. We did a job.

Mike?

Thank you, Mike. And good job. Mr. Secretary.

Thank you.

That was a great victory. Great job.

Great job.

Thank you very much. Great going. Jared -- you know. Secretary.

Johnny, thank you.

Good. Thank you. Congratulations.

Oh, we're going to have it. Thank you very much. Congratulations.

That's right.

Fantastic race.

You did a great job. Thank you.

Congratulations.

And that worked out quite well, hasn't it? Huh?

Amazing.

Just hit the right spots, I guess.

Because that was a big one.

Great, Mike. Thank you very much.

Thanks.

Good. Thank you very much.

That was a great race. And congratulations. You and I felt very lonely there for a while, right? Had everybody in the world coming down but you ran a great race.

Congratulations, Brian.

Very good. Great to see you.

We are very much involved with Lake Okeechobee. And a lot of problems in Florida can be solved by doing that properly. They've been trying to do it for 30 years. So we'll get it done, okay? Good job. Thank you all very much. We're going to have a little discussion now about how we can help the various governors, and it's going to be a very good discussion.

Thank you all very much.

We're interviewing people now for Chief of Staff, yes.

Five people. Really good ones. Terrific people. Mostly well known, but terrific people.

That's great.

Well, the FBI said Michael Flynn -- a general and a great person -- they said he didn't lie. And Mueller said, "Well, maybe he did." And now they're all having a big dispute. So I think it's a great thing that the judge is looking into that situation. That's a -- that's an honor for a lot of terrific people.

Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you.
