I'll tell you, Senator Lindsey Graham, they really bring out the crowd. He's a popular guy. Well, first of all, I want to thank everybody. So many friends. I want to thank the legendary Pam Bondi. Thank you. Thank you Pam, I appreciate it.

And, Lindsey, just so you understand, I heard about Lindsey was speaking. So I said, if Lindsey's speaking I want to come down and hear him speak. For two reasons: number one, he's a great speaker, and number two, I know if I'm here he's not going to say anything bad about me.

And our First Lady, who is more popular than I am... come here. Come here. Come.  All over the country, they love our First Lady, I want to tell you that. She's been fantastic.

So, enjoy yourselves. Lindsey, a lot of pressure  nervous for the first time in my life. No,  terrific, and I just really look forward to hearing your words, Lindsey. And, thank you for having done a great job. Thank you very much.
