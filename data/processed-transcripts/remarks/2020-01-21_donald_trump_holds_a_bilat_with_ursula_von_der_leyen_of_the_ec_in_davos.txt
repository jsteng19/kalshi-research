Well, thank you very much. It's great to be with the President of the European Commission and a woman who's highly respected, I have to say, and I hear a very tough negotiator, which is bad news for us because we're going to talk about a big trade deal. And we've been talking about it for a while, and hopefully we can get something done.

But it's a great honor, and we will be discussing other things also. But I would say trade, right now, on a deal between ourselves and essentially Europe, is something that we all want to be able to make. So, thank you very much. A great honor. Thank you.

Thank you. If you would like to say --

Thank you.

Yes.

That's right.

That's right.

Thank you very much.

It's very nice. Great honor. Thank you. Thank you all. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you.

That whole thing is a hoax. It goes nowhere because nothing happened. The only thing we've done is a great job. We have the strongest country in the world by far. It was going in the wrong direction. We have the greatest economy we've ever had in the history of our country. And I'm in Europe today because we're bringing a lot of other companies into our country with thousands of jobs -- millions of jobs, in many cases.

So that whole thing is a total hoax. So I'm sure it's going to work out fine. Thank you all very much.

Thank you very much.
