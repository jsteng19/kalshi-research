Thank you, Emmanuel. Very nice. And we look forward to it. And we actually have a lot in common, Emmanuel and I. We've been friends for a long time.

And every once in a while, we go at it just a little bit -- not very much. But we get along very well. We have a very good relationship. Sort of, I think I can say, a special relationship. We all remember the Eiffel Tower dinner, and that was a very good beginning. And we have some really great things to talk about.

And we couldn't have asked for better weather or a more beautiful location. And next year, we'll be hosting in the United States, so that will be very -- very good. That'll be great. We'll do a good job. But so far, so good. The weather is perfect. The guest is fantastic. Everybody is getting along. And I think we'll accomplish a lot this weekend, and I look forward to it. And thank you for having us.

Thank you very much.
