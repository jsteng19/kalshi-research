Thank you very much. It's a great honor to have Prime Minister Modi with us. His representatves... we've had a lot of discussions already. We're making great progress. The relationship with the United States and India is very, very strong and very, very powerful.

We agree on most things and, I would say, by the end of the day, we'll agree on everything, I have a feeling. But I just want to tell you, Mr. Prime Minister, it is a great honor to have you in the United States. Thank you. Thank you for being here.

Well, thank you very much. And thank you very much for the equipment, ordering equipment from the United States. Always makes us feel very good. And, there√ïs nobody makes military equipment like we make military equipment. Nobody even close. So we want to thank you very much, and we look forward to getting on with the meeting. Thank you. Thank you ladies and gentlemen. Thank you.
