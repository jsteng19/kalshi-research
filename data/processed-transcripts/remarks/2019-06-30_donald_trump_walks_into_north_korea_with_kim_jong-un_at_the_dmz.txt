Good. Would you like me to step across?

I'm okay with it.

Big moment. Big moment. big progress. Tremendous progress.

So, I was in Japan, and then . And I said yes, I said

I feel great. It's a great honor to be here. Great honor.

I just want to say that this is my honor. I didn't really expect it. We were in Japan for the G20. We came over and I said, "Hey, I'm over here. I want to call up Chairman Kim." And we got to meet. And stepping across that line was a great honor.

A lot of progress has been made. A lot of friendships have been made. And this has been in particular a great friendship. So I just want to thank you. That was very quick notice, and I want to thank you.

So we're going to go inside. We're going to talk for a little while about different things. And a lot of really positive things are happening, and I'm glad you could be here to see it. But tremendous positivity.

Really great things are happening and -- in a lot of places. But we met and we liked each other from day one, and that was very important.

Thank you, everybody. Thank you.

I would invite him right now -- to the White House. Absolutely.

Thank you. I think it is. And it's a great day for a lot of people. It's a great day, really, for the world, if you think about it. Beyond North Korea, South Korea, it's a great day for the world and it's an honor for me to be here. Thank you both very much.

Well, I want to thank everybody, Thank you all for being here. I have to say that when I first became President of the United States, there was great conflict in this area. Great, great conflict, and now, we have just the opposite, and it's my honor, and it's the Chairman's honor, I would say we work well together, and Mr. President, thank you.
