Thank you for being here. Thank you Secretary Chao for your service, and for your great leadership as we rebuild America, which is exactly what we're doing. It's going ahead of schedule. It's wonderful to be joined by so many incredible leaders from our state departments of transportatation from all over the country.

You're really the stewards of the vast majority of our nations' roads, and bridges, and so many other things. I know you just had a very productive discussion about ways the federal government can help expedite vital infrastructure products, which is what we're doing today and that's what we're all about today, and even this week, I have to say. We call it Infrastructure Week.

We are working very hard to reduce the permitting and approval process on major projects from 10 years down to the shortest time possible. Yesterday I said two years or less, I'd like to say one year would be realy the number. A highway today takes years and years and years to get approved -- sometimes as much as 15 or 17 years. By the time they get the approvals, they need a different highway. So we don't want that.

We want to partner with state leaders, like you, to fix our crumbling infrastructure, build new shining monuments to our magnificent nation, and we are going to massively streamline that process. Faster approvals and innovative partnerships with the state, local and private sector leaders will translate into dramatic improvements all across the country.

And we're starting to see the fruits of our labor -- starting to see it very, very quickly already, and it hasn't been very long that we've been in office. Our infrastructure will once again be the envy of the world.

Right now it's being scoffed at and laughed at -- it will once again be the envy of the world. Thank you for joining us today, I look forward to hearing from you, and I think what we'll do is we'll around, you can introduce yourself and where you're from, and we'll start... Ray.
