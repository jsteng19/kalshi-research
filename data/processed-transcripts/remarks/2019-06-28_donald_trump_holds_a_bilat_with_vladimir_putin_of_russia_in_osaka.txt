Thank you very much everybody. It's a great honor to be with President Putin, his representatives, my representatives. We have many things to discuss, including trade, and including some disarmament and some -- a little protectionism, perhaps, in a very positive way. And we're going to discuss a lot of different things.

We've had great meetings. We have had a very, very good relationship. And we look forward to spending some pretty good time together. A lot of very positive things going to come out of the relationship. So, Vladimir, thank you very much. Thank you.

Thank you very much. Thank you.

Yes, of course, I will. Don't meddle in the election, President. Don't meddle in the election.

We haven't discussed it. We haven't discussed it.
