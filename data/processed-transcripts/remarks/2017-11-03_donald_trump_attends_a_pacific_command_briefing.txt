Well, thank you very much. So many familiar faces, admiral, from the media. They're lovely people. Good relationships. But I'll tell you, this is very special to be in Hawaii, and to be visiting, very shortly, Pearl Harbor, which I've read about, spoken about, heard about, studied, but I haven't seen.

And that's going to be very exciting for me and my wife. So thank you very much. It's really incredible. It's been wonderful meeting the folks that you're with, and that's a lot of talent. A lot of tough people, and a lot of talented people and we appreciate it.

Thank you.

Thank you. Appreciate it.
