It's a terrible, terrible thing. Unthinkable. We've been fighting it for a long time, a lot of people have, a lot of people don't want to talk about it. It's a terrible thing. I just spoke with the Prime Minister. I spoke with the various government officials and we are working with Sri Lanka. But that's a terrible thing. Thank you.

Nobody disobeys my orders.

Not even a little bit.

I will. Oh It's happening. It's being built now. Here's a young guy who said 'Keep building that wall. Can you believe it?' He's going to be a conservative some day, huh?

You gonna say hello to your dad? Whose is this? So is everything good? Everything good? You got that one, right?

Thank you kids. Have a good time. Do well in school. Work hard.   alright? Who would want to be?  Have a good time everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much.
