Well, thank you very much. We've had a great time,  a great stay and tomorrow is really the main event -- very important event in the history of Japan. It's over 200 years and something like this has happened, so it's a great honor to be representing the United States, and the Prime Minister and I talked a lot today about trade, and military and various other things and likewise will be a very productive day, and I just want to thank you. That was an incredible evening at Sumo --  Sumo wrestling.

And the United States, we contributed -- I didn't, personally, I didn't want to have anybody get me in trouble, so we did it personally -- we bought that beautiful trophy, which they'll have hopefully for many hundreds of years, and that will be their trophy for the Championship -- Sumo championships, and it was very nice tonight and we really enjoyed being there.

That was something to see, these these great athletes, because they really are athletes. It's a very ancient sport, and I've always wanted to see sumo wrestling, so was really great. Thank you very much for being here.
