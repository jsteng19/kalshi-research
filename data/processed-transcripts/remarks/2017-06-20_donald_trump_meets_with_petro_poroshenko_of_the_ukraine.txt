Thank you very much. It's a great honor to be with President Poroshenko of the Ukraine -- a place that we've all been very much involved in. And you've been seeing it and everybody has been reading about it.

And we've had some very, very good discussions. It's going to continue throughout the day. And I think a lot of progress has been made. And it's a great honor to have you, Mr. President. Thank you. Thank you very much. Would you like to say something?

Well, thank you. It's a great honor. Thank you very much. Thank you.

I think Otto -- it's a disgrace what happened to Otto. It's a total disgrace what happened to Otto. That should never, ever be allowed to happen. And frankly, if he were brought home sooner, I think the result would have been a lot different. He should have been brought home that same day. The result would have been a lot different.
