I want to thank everybody. We have Army, we have everybody here. But I have to say, even you guys have to admit, I hear the Coast Guard saved 11,000 people. Eleven... Think of it, almost 11,000 people, by going into winds that the media would not go into.

They will not go into, unless it's a really good story, in which case they will. But I want to congratulate everybody. I want to congratulate the Coast Guard for what you've done, incredible. Incredible.

And I gave the commencement speech this year at the Coast Guard academy, and they're gonna come out and compete with you guys now pretty soon, you know that right? So I want to congratulate you, you guys, the army guys. This has been, I mean, it's brutal, what was up there.

But you have done so much for the service. And we respect... and the whole world is watching. The whole world is watching. So I want to thank you. And I want to thank... look at all these. Thank you fellas, thank you everybody. Thank you.

You have done so much for the prestige of the service. And the coast guard and what you've done. And again, thank you very much. Thank you very much. We're going to Louisiana now, and they're in, uh, pretty good shape too.

They're in pretty good shape. We were just with the governor, and it's it's going pretty well.  But you people have done something so special. Thank you. We're with you 1,000 percent.
