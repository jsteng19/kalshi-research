Well, thank you very much. This was a great and, just an amazing day. This was a little bit of an endurance test. He was just testing to see whether or not I had the endurance. I do, very easily. We could have done it ten times over. But what a beautiful job. It's made easier by the incredible work you've done.

So, thank you very much. On behalf of a lot of these people that came with me, congratulations. Beautiful job.

Looks good.

It's like, like in the old, just a lot heavier.

Well, it's just a message of unity, when you look at what we've just seen. It's great unity, great faith. They're incredible people, with a tremendous leader, who's a friend of mine.

Thank you very much, everybody.
