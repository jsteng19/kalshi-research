Jon, you know Jim Brown? The greatest of all time.

And what people don't know, Kanye -- everybody knows, right? Every -- does the world know Kanye? Kanye, what people don't know about Jim -- they say -- first of all, he's the best football player. But they say he was an even better lacrosse player. Do you think so?

Huh?

I heard he was even -- at Syracuse.

Well, it's great to have you, Jim. Great to have you.

Kanye, it's great to be with you.

And these are two friends of mine. And Kanye has been a friend of mine for a long time. And Jim is -- Jim came out of nowhere, and he said, "I like what the President is doing." A long time ago we met. Right? And I just appreciated it very much.

And, you know, if you look at the employment numbers, if you look at the median income, if you look at every single indicator, we're keeping our promise, Jim. Thank you. And I want to thank you.

I like North Korea too.

Yeah. Yeah. Well, he's -- turned out to be good. Dialogue. We had a little dialogue. And Secretary of State just came back -- Mike. He just came back from North Korea. We had very good meetings, and we'll meet again. But we're doing good. No more nuclear testing. No more missiles going up. No more nothing. And it's -- that was headed to war. That was headed to war.

Yeah. It was so close. We spoke -- I spoke to President Obama. I will tell you, that was headed to war. And now it's going to be -- I believe it's going to work out very well.

We really stopped the war. Saved millions of lives. You know, Seoul has 30 million people. You don't realize how big. Thirty million people who are right near the border; 30 miles off the border. Millions of people would have been killed. And I will say, Chairman Kim has been really good. Really good. And we've made a lot of progress.

That's nice that you say that, because that's a big -- that's a big thing. These folks were covering -- they were covering North Korea not -- I think not very promisingly. And there were a lot of problems. President Obama said that was his biggest problem. And I don't say anything is solved --

Yeah.

It was a big solving. And not solved yet, but I think we're along -- I think we're on the way.

No, no. It's -- we're well on our way.

In a short period of time, Jim. Very short period of time. You know, I left Singapore three months ago. And we've made a lot of progress. So it's very good. Hey, look, that's one of many things. But I appreciate everything with you.

I'll tell you what -- Kim was in. Mrs. Johnson, we got her out. She was very unfairly treated. And there are many other people like that, that --

What did he do? Larry? What happened?

Yes, tell me. Tell us.

What was the sentence?

How old is he? How old?

Sixty-eight years old?

Wisconsin. Yeah. Wisconsin.

We'll get rid of Air Force One. Can we get rid of Air Force One?  No? You don't like that idea.

It's true.

I'll tell you what -- that was pretty impressive, folks.  You know, I hate to say this -- Jim, do you want to say something?  What do you after that?

You are -- please, Jim. Please.

Great, right? Isn't that a great statement?

And it's so true.

As a country. It's -- very -- I've never seen Jim Brown impressed before.  He was impressed. That's true. That statement is amazing, huh?

I want to say it's great to have you guys here. And we're going to go and we're going to have some lunch.

That was quite something. That was quite something.

Yeah.

Really very interesting.

Yes, yeah. Please.

No, no. It's okay.

Hey, I'm open-minded. I'm here. I am open-minded.

He can speak for me anytime he wants. He's been a great guy. He's a smart cookie. Smart. He gets it. These two guys -- Jim Brown. He's been doing this for a long time.

Could very well be.

Could very well be. That's good. I'm glad to hear that.

Let me ask you this question. You're in the Oval Office --

How does it feel to be in the Oval Office?

Isn't it good energy?

It's a great place. Jim, how do you feel?

You are so respected. And what Kanye is doing has been incredible. All over the world they're talking about this. And I have to tell you, I had important meetings today with senators and with everything. Nobody cared. They wanted this meeting. This is the meeting. Is that right? I can say that to Jon.

The others were good, right? But this is what they want.

Well, it's my honor, Jim. I want to tell you. I've been a fan of yours for a long time.

Long time. Nobody like you. Nobody like you. No athlete like you.

Yeah. That's really nice, Jim.

And you know, that's always been the way Jim has been -- for a long time. And he just wanted to help. And it's something special.

Jennifer, did you have a question?

Well, we're going to look at it.

I'm open to everything. Hey, look, I think it's a shame what's happening in Chicago.

I'm in Chicago a lot, too. I have nice things in Chicago. You know that, right? And I hate to see what's happening. They're having numbers -- the numbers of people being shot and killed and it's -- it's not for this country. So they have to do something. And I am totally open. If we can do it a different way, Kanye, I'm totally open. I mean, we all agree they have to do something, that's for sure.

Well, maybe it's a combination of both. Yeah, I guess it is. But I think it's probably a combination of both. And it's also a respect issue. They respect this guy. They respect this guy. That's a big thing. Right now, they're not respecting, let's say, your mayor, or let's say your leadership in Chicago. But certainly it shouldn't be happening. What's going on there should not be happening.

Steve? Go ahead.

Honestly, from our standpoint, this was just set up to be a lunch of two people that I like. And I guess they like me. And we're going to have lunch. We're going to talk.

I know.

But I don't want to take -- I don't want to put you in that spot, but --

That's really nice. Come here. That's really nice. And that's from the heart. I didn't want to put you in that position.  But that's from the heart. Special guy.

These two are special people. Whether you like it, whether you don't like it, they're special people. And I appreciate it. Jim, Kanye, I appreciate it. So let's go have some lunch.

Thank you all very much.
