Come on over here, fellas. Meet a great gentleman who is very brave, I have to say.

I got it. Did you -- Did you hear it fall?

You saw -- So Michael, you saw that happen. You saw that coming down.

Didn't miss by much.

And they got here on time, and --

How quickly?

Right. Right.

They did a great job.

Well, thank you. Do you have any questions, anybody, for Michael, who really rode out the storm. Incredible.

Steve, go ahead.

He thought it was over.

That's great.

Yeah.

Michael's been here for many hurricanes, and he said, but there's never been anything that you've seen like this.

Yeah, and this one you could have passed, right?

Thank you Michael. Thanks.
