Right.

Right.

You did a great job.

Well, I have to say that we've been friends for a long time, hard to believe, right? I remember that first meeting very well and h we liked each other and we worked with each other and now we can work in the highest capacity and we'll bring peace not only here, but I know you're very much involved in helping us in other regions like what's happening with Russia, Ukraine, etc.

And I think we're having some pretty good news coming out of there today and maybe tomorrow and maybe Friday, frankly, but we'll see about that. But I just want to thank you for everything and maybe in particular, our friendship. It's been a very loyal, great, beautiful friendship and the job you've done is second to none.

You look at this, it's so beautiful. As a construction person, I'm seeing perfect marble. This is what they call perfecto and just a great job you've done and what a beautiful place. And we appreciate those camels. I haven't seen camels like that in a long time, and that was some greeting. We appreciate it very much.

Thank you very much.
