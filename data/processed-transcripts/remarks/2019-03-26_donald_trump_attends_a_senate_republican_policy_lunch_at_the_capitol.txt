I don't think they're talking about impeachment. We have the greatest economy we've ever had. Our country is in incredible shape. They and others created a fraud on our country with this ridiculous witch hunt, where it was proven, very strongly, no collusion, no obstruction. No nothing. We are doing so well. We've never probably had a time of prosperity like this. It's been great.

Yeah.

I think it went very high up. I think what happened is a disgrace. I don't believe our country should allow this ever to happen again. This will never happen again. We cannot let it ever happen again. It went very high up, and it started fairly low, but with instructions from the high up. This should never happen to a President again.

We can't allow that to take place.

I don't want to say that, but I think you know the answer.

Who said what?

The Mueller report was great. It could not have been better. It said, "No obstruction. No collusion." It could not have been better.

Let me tell you exactly what my message is: The Republican Party will soon be known as the Party of Healthcare. You watch.
