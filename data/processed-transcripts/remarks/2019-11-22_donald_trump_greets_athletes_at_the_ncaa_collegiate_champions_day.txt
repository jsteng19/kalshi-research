Thank you very much, everybody. We're having a great year. This has been an amazing year for our economy. And meeting these athletes -- they're real athletes, I can tell you. It's a tremendous achievement. And we're bringing many of them over to the Oval Office. I guess all of them. So far, nobody has turned that one down --  -- because it is a special place.

They want to be there within 25 years, somebody out of here. So -- but we had a -- we've had a great time. This has been the best economy we've ever had. We're up again today. We have a lot of things going. The China deal is coming along very well. It's a question of whether or not I want to make it. And tremendous things are happening.

I think we had a tremendous week with the hoax. You know, the great hoax. They call it the "impeachment hoax." And that's really worked out incredibly well. And we have tremendous support. I think Roger is around here someplace. I don't think I've ever seen support in the Republican Party like we do right now. We've never had this kind of support.

Yeah, thank you very much, Roger. I'll see you -- I'll see you over at the -- we'll see you over at the Oval Office.

What whistleblower? I don't think there is. I consider it to be a fake whistleblower, because what we he wrote didn't correspond to what I said in any way, shape, or form. Thank you very much everybody.

Thank you very much everybody.
