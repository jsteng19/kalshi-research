Thank you very much. President Moon, I want to thank you so much for that beautiful ceremony. It doesn't get more beautiful than that, and I know the work that was put into it. And I watched all of those tens of thousands of people along the route in proudly waving your flag, your great flag, and also waving the American flag, in many cases. I was very happy to see such spirit. You have tremendous spirit in this country, and it's a great country.

I just have to say that it's an honor to be with you and your beautiful wife. And we look forward to having a very successful, really, day of talks. We'll start right now and we'll conclude sometime tomorrow. And then I go off to China, where we look forward to a tremendous success, also. We just left Japan, and there's a great spirit. It's a great part of the world, and it's a very tremendous honor to be here and to be with you.

And again, I very much appreciate the reception. Thank you very much.
