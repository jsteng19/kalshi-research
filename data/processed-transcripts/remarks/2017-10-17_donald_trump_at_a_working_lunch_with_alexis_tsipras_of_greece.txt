Mr. Prime Minister, it's great to have you in the United States. This is the Cabinet Room, a very well-known place. A lot of things happen here. And we will continue our discussions with respect to Greece and the relationship that we have.

It's been an outstanding one, a long-term relationship. You've gone through a lot. I commend you on what you've been able to do in a short period of time. I know your tourism is coming back very strongly. You had a record number of tourists, which we have to give you a lot of credit for that.

But it's a beautiful place. Many, many friends from Greece. And we are with you. We are with you. And thank you. It's an honor to have you.

Thank you.

It's true.

I know that. That's true. One-hundred percent. Great supporters.

Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you very much. Thank you.
