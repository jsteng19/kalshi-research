We're signing a joint declaration on advancing defense cooperation with Poland and the United States. It has been under -- I think you could say under review. We've been looking at it for many years, and it's getting done now. We have a great relationship with Poland. And, Mr. President, I'd like to thank you very much.

It's been a lot of fun working with you, and I think it's been very productive. We're also doing waivers -- the visa waivers for Poland. And that's in the works. We're working on the structure right now. But you can report back to the people of Poland, and the Polish people in the United States, that President Trump got it done, and nobody else could for a long time, as you know.

So thank you very much, Mr. President. Thank you.  Thank you.  Congratulations. It's fantastic. Thank you very much. Thank you. We're going into the other room now. If you want to go, come.
