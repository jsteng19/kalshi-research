Yes.

Well, thank you very much, Mr. President. It's an honor to be with you both and with your representatives. And we did a lot of work over the last two days. We did a lot flying to get here, but a lot of work and very productive work. And we've seen a good deal of your country, and it's a great country.

The relationship has never been better between India and the United States. And, as you know, we're working on major trade deals and military purchase deals, and a lot of other things. And very positive things. And I just want to thank you. Ma'am, I'd like to thank you very much. This is a great honor to have met you.

And, on behalf of the First Lady, myself, and all of my representatives, this was a tremendous learning experience and something very special. India, to me, is a very, very special nation and it's great to be with you. Thank you very much, Mr. President.
