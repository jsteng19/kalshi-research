Thank you very much everybody. We have some wonderful meetings going on over the last two days. We are friends. We've been friends now for a long time Emir, haven't we?

And our relationship is extremely good. We have some very serious discussions right now going on. And one of the things we will discuss is the purchase of lots of beautiful military equipment, because nobody makes it like the United States. And for us that means jobs. And it also means frankly great security back there, which we want. So it's an honor to be with you. Thank you very much.

Okay, thank you everybody.
