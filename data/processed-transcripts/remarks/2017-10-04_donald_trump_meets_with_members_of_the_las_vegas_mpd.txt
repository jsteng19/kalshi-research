I think that the interaction saved hundreds and hundreds of lives. Well, I want to congratulate you on a job well done.

The professionalism... I just left the hospital, and I have to tell you, the doctors, the nurses, everybody over there was incredible. And...

Well, they were really...  I met a lot of the patients, and you saved them, and the doctors, nurses all of the people at the hospital saved them. Cab drivers were great.

Tremendous number of stories. But what the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police did is -- but I've always known you were good, right?

You know that.  I've always known you guys were good, but you really proved it. And he's a sick, demented man.  Have they been able to find out anything else?  It's a little bit soon?

Well, again, I'm going to say a few words to your group, but I just wanted to come in and say hello and congratulate you.  I was a fan before this -- you know that.  Everyone in this room knows that.  A big fan before this.

And I guess, if you could be more of a fan, I guess I'm even more of a fan now.  But you showed the world, and the world is watching.

And you showed what professionalism is all about, because that was about as fast -- something like that could take place for hours and hours and hours, and you can't figure it out.  And you should be very proud, Sheriff.

He did a good job, didn't he?  He did a good job.  Now, his option would have been try to do it himself.  But if it doesn't work, you wouldn't have had the information, maybe, right?  He did the right thing.

Calm and strong and sharp.
