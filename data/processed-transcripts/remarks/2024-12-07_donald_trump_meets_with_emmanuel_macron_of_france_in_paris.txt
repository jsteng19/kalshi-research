Well, thank you very much.

Thank you very much. Very great honor. And we had a great relationship, as everyone knows. We accomplished a lot together, and the people of France are spectacular. I guess it's one of our largest groups in the United States, French people. And we respect them, and we love them. Very talented people. Extremely energetic people, as you know very well.

And it's an honor to be here. We had a good time together, and we had a lot of -- a lot of success, really great success working together on defense and offense, too, and it certainly seems like the world is going a little crazy right now, and we'll be talking about that. Thank you very much for being here.

Thank you.
