Thank you very much. It's a great honor to have Prime Minister Solberg of Norway. Just had a very resounding election victory, so it's another four years at least. And very respected by her country. Very liked by her country.

We do a lot of business with Norway, and I know you just bought some additional military equipment in the form of F-35s and other things, and so I congratulate you. We make the best in the world, we make. And Norway is a great customer and a great ally, and a great friend. So it's an honor to have you. Thank you very much.

Well, we're doing a little bit, and we do make great product. And we were just discussing with the Prime Minister, we make the greatest military equipment in the world, and you buy a lot of it and we appreciate that. It's called jobs.

But it's also called great equipment.

Yes.

Oh, good. Well, that's good.

We do that too. Thank you very much.

Thank you, everybody. Thank you very much.
