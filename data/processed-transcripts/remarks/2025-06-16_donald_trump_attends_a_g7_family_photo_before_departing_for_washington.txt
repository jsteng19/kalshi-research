Well, I have to be back. Very important. I want to just thank our great host.

Fantastic job. Thank you. And Canada, but you probably see what I see. I have to be back as soon as I can. I'm going to have dinner with the -- these wonderful leaders, and then I get on the plane. I have to be back early for obvious reasons.

I loved it. I tell you, I loved it. And I think we got a lot done.

Really a lot done. In fact, the U.K., we signed --

-- a big trade deal today and we're working on others. But we had just a really great relationship with everybody, and It's really nice. I wish I could stay for tomorrow, but they understand.

This is -- this is big stuff.

Do you have questions for anybody else?

We'll see you on the plane.

We'll see you on the plane.

Thank you everybody.
