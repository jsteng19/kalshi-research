I want to thank you. Because  It was great. Look, I mean, the world is watching, and it's very important for the world.

Well, I want to thank you, Chairman. You hear the power of that voice. Nobody has heard that voice before. He doesn't do news conferences, in case you haven't heard. And this was a special moment. This is, I think, really -- as President Moon said, this is a historic moment, the fact that we're meeting.

And I want to thank Chairman Kim for something else. When I put out the social media notification, if he didn't show up, the press was going to make me look very bad. So you made us both look good, and I appreciate it. But we've developed a great relationship. I really think that, if you go back two and half years, and you look at what was going on prior to my becoming President, it was a very, very bad situation -- a very dangerous situation for South Korea, for North Korea, for the world.

And I think the relationship that we've developed has meant so much to so many people. And it's just an honor to be with you, and it was an honor that you asked me to step over that line. And I was proud to step over the line. I thought you might do that; I wasn't sure. But I was ready to do it. And I want to thank you.

It's been great. It's been great. A very historic meeting. We were just saying -- one of the folks from the media was saying this could to be a very historic moment, and I guess that's what it is. But I enjoyed being with you, and thank you very much.
