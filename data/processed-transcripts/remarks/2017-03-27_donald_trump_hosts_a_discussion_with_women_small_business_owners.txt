Good morning, everybody. Thank you very much. It's my pleasure to welcome such incredible women, including my daughter --

-- and unbelievable entrepreneurs and small business leaders to the White House. And also, Linda, thank you very much. You've been doing an amazing job -- I hear working 24 hours a day is what the word is.  Good. I'm not surprised.

I'm not surprised. And I want to thank Linda for joining us today. She's doing a fantastic job leading the Small Business Administration, and she herself, as you know, is a great, great success story and a woman entrepreneur at the highest level. So thank you very much, Linda.

Empowering and promoting women in business is an absolute priority in the Trump administration because I know how crucial women are as job creators, role models, and leaders all throughout our communities.

As we conclude Women's History Month, I am thrilled that we can meet to discuss how we can continue this important mission. You all have incredible stories. Many of you started businesses from scratch, with very, very limited resources -- sounds like I'm right about you, Lisa, right?  But you had the grit and determination to make your dreams become a reality, right?

It's fantastic. Now you're providing hundreds of jobs across our country -- thousands of jobs. And you're really an inspiration to everybody -- and that's men and women, believe me. A lot of men out there, they're not doing what you're able to do.

Today, women are the primary source of income in 40 percent of American households with children under the age of 15. We also know that companies that promote women to senior leadership roles realize significantly better profits, according to statistics, than their competitors. I wouldn't have known that. Dina, how does that work? Tell me. That's pretty impressive.

We must ensure that our economy is a place where women can work and thrive. We will continue to address the barriers faced by women professionals and entrepreneurs, including access to capital, access to markets, and access to networks. We will make it very easy. It's going to be a lot easier. You do an amazing job. And for a while it was a very, very tough -- almost impossible -- job.

My administration will also continue to advocate for policies that support working families, including making childcare more affordable and accessible. That's something that Ivanka Trump -- now Ivanka Trump Kushner -- that you really have been working on and feel so strongly about -- my daughter. I actually talked about it a lot during the campaign, and Ivanka was right up front. I also want to recognize Ivanka for helping to lead a national initiative to promote women business leaders and entrepreneurs. And the Chancellor of Germany is going to -- has asked Ivanka to go to Germany, and she'll be working on similar issues with Chancellor Merkel. So that will be very exciting for you. That's going to happen very soon. It's a very great honor.

I look forward to hearing your stories and discussing how we can work together to help all of your dreams come true and make it easier for those dreams to come true. And with that, I'm going to turn it over to our great Vice President, Mike Pence. And thank you, Mike, for being here.

Great. And you've done a great job.

Thank you very much. Lisa.

Thank you very much. And I hear that Lisa Phillips has an amazing story to tell.  Can you tell it in front of all these cameras?  I hear that you have one of the really amazing stories to tell. So you want me to ask the press to leave? I will.  Go ahead.

Thank you. Great job. You've done a fantastic job. Thank you, Lisa.

That's great.
