Hello, everybody. Welcome to the White House. What an exciting group here tonight. It's really something. Is everybody having a good time?   no matter where you go -- you know, the biggest people come here, and they all have beautiful offices. But when they walk into the Oval Office, it's -- there's nothing like it. They look and they -- some of them actually start crying.

And these are business leaders. I don't like to see that. We can do better than that, but some of them actually get emotional. But just have a good time. We told you to give -- get an extra special tour. You're the first one of the year. Get an extra special tour, especially for this guy right here.

Good. Any questions? Yes.

Thank you very much. That's great. We love our country, right?

We're trying to get rid of this horrible Ukraine-Russia war. And I think we're doing a lot. We're dealing with both parties and Europe. And I think we'll get it done. It should have never started, should never ever have started. And if it did start, it could have been ended in a week, not after three years of bloodshed and millions of people killed and all of that great architecture knocked down.

You know, those beautiful spires are all knocked down and gone, thousands of years old. It's terrible. But that's what it is. But now, we're here, and we're going to solve the problem. But I want to thank you very much for coming. The tour is so great, and we did such a good job. First lady worked very hard on making it perfect.

And I think you're going to really love it. And I heard you were here, and I said, "Let's stop by and say hello." And it's a group of very smart-looking people, I must say. Very smart. Maybe someday, you'll be -- you'll be here as the president, right? Somebody -- somebody in this group has a chance. Have a good time.

Have a great tour. And you're going to give them a special tour. OK? You're going to get a special tour. Have fun, everybody.
