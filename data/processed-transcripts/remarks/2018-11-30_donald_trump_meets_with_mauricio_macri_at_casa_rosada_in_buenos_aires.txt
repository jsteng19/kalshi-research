I think I understood you better in your language than I did on this. But that's okay. I want to just say that I've been friends with Mauricio for a long time, many years. People wouldn't know that. He was a very young man, very handsome man. And we knew each other very well.

And I actually did business with his family, with his father. Great father. He was a friend a mine. And I purchased the West Side railroad yards, and it was a great job, a successful job. A very big job. One of the largest jobs in Manhattan. That was in my civilian days. And so I always had fond memories.

Little did I know that his son would become a President,  you were going to be. And little did you realize that I was going to become President.

So we've known each other a long while. We're going to be talking about lots of good things for Argentina, for the United States, including trade, including military purchases, and other things. But we have a lot to talk about -- a little bit of old times; about 95 percent business, I would say.

But this is a great honor to be with you. You're my friend, long time. Great family. And you're doing a fantastic job, and I want to congratulate you. Thank you.
