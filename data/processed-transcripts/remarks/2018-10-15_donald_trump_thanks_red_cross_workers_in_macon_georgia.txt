So when I was a civilian, I have to tell you, we raised more money at Mar-a-Lago, when I was a civilian, than any other place on the planet for the Red Cross, and I want to thank your incredible people, you've done an unbelievable job working with the first responders, but you really, in my opinion, you are first responders in my opinion.

But I just want to tell you, fantastic job. Respected by everybody. They all look forward to seeing the Red Cross, the job you do So, I want to thank you very much. How is it going over here? Tell me, how's it going in Georgia?

It's all pretty smooth, isn't it?

Fantastic job. Right next to the White House, you know, the Red Cross building. And I pass that building, and I say, that's a beautiful building. I want to thank you all. You really do a fantastic job. On behalf of the the first lady of myself and the first lady is a big, big fan of the Red Cross, so thank you.

Thank you very much. That's beautiful.

Thank you. Thank you everybody. Really great job. Just -- now go back to work.
