Beautiful. Mongolia -- they're great fighters. You know, they're great fighters, great wrestlers, great champions. Right? And we have the grand champion of sumo wrestling with us, from a couple of years ago. And he's here from Mongolia. I was told that in Japan, actually, that they've had four grand champions from Mongolia.

So they're great, great fighters. Your people are great fighters. Thank you very -- we need great fighters too.
