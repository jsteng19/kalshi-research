Thank you very much. It's been a great honor to have the Prime Minister of Japan and his extraordinary wife with us tonight at Mar-a-Lago. We call this the Southern White House. It was originally built, as you probably have heard, as the Southern White House. And it's turned out to be the Southern White House. So it's really an honor.

We've have had two very productive days on trade, on military, on North Korea. And we will continue, and we will also continue into the weeks ahead. And we're coming up with what will be a very fair trade deal for both countries. And we look forward to it. Plus, we have some very big meetings, as we all know, on North Korea.

But, Mr. Prime Minister, I very much appreciate you being here. And we look forward to many, many years of great friendship. Thank you very much.

Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much.
