Thank you very much. We're all here as a very friendly, well-unified group. It's a well-knit-together group of people. And we hope that we're going to make some great progress for our country. I think that will happen, and we appreciate it very much. And, Chuck, Nancy, would you say anything -- like to say anything? Chuck?

That's very true. Thank you, Nancy, very much. Mitch.

Thank you very much. Paul.

Mike, you have anything?

Well, thank you very much. I thought that with what's going on in the world, I would bring our great military genius/person along and maybe General Mattis could say a couple of words.

I am too. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you very much.
