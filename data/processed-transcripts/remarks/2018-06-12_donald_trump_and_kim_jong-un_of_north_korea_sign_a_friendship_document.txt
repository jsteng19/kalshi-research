So we're signing a very important document, a pretty comprehensive document, and we've had a really great term together, a great relationship. I'll be giving a news conference at 2:30, which is in a little bit less than two hours, and we'll discussint this at great length. In the meantime, I believe that they'll be handing it out on behalf of Chairman Kim and myself, and we're both very honored to sign the document. Thank you,

Would you like to say something to the press?

Thank you very much. Okay.

We're starting that process. Very quickly. very, very quickly, absolutely.

You'll be seeing everything in just a little while. The letter that we're signing is very comprehensive and I think both sides are going to be very impressed with the result. A lot of goodwill went into this, a lot of work, a lot of preparation. I want to thank everybody on both sides. Secretary Pompeo and all of his counterparts, they were absolutely fantastic.

Thank you very much. It's fantastic.

Thank you very much everybody.  We'll see you a little bit later, and we're very proud of what took place today. I think our whole relationship with North Korea and the Korean Peninsula is -- it's going to be a very much different situation than it has in the past. Donald Trump
