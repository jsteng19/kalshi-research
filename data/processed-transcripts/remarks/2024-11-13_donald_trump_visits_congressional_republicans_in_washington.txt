Well, thank you very much. This is a very nice gathering. Isn't it nice to win? It's nice to win. It's always nice to win. A lot of good friends in this room. So, you -- you know we had, like, historic kind of numbers, especially for the president, but we won't get into that. But the House did very well.

And I think we're responsible for 31 -- helping you with 31, meaning we could have lost by quite a bit and we ended up -- I guess you'll be five up. Are you looking at five or four? Five or four, right? Doesn't matter. We get used to one for a little while. When you can get used to one, you can get used to anything.

So, I just want to thank everybody. You've been incredible. We worked with a lot of you to get you in, and you helped me -- and you helped me, too. And my numbers were -- so they say the -- 129 years, this is the most important election in 129 years. That's pretty good. I said, "Who is the 129 years?" What was that, Doc Ronny? What was -- who was the 129 years ago? I never looked because it started at being 100, and then they upped it to that.

But it's a great compliment. We won the majority by 7.1 million. We won, which is great because Republicans aren't supposed to be winning the majority, Marjorie. You know that, right? And we won that, and we won it every -- every way, all seven swing states, by a lot. And Michigan was great. It couldn't be better.

I'll tell you, Michigan was great. And  we had a couple of people -- almost New Jersey is right, just a few points. It's got them very worried because they say, "Well, next time, if we go up even a fraction of what we went up, you're going to win New York, you're going to win New Jersey, you're going to win places that weren't winnable."

California, too. I think without one speech, without campaigning at all in California --
