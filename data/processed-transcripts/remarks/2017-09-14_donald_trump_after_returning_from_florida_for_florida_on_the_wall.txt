We're renovating large sections of wall. It will be brand new by the time we've finish. We're building samples of four different walls in order to make the choice, and after the choice is made, we'll either have it in budget or some place, and if the Democrats aren't going to approve it, then we're not going to do what they want, so, I think it'll work out.

We're working on a deal for DACA, but a lot has to do with the amount of security. We want very heavy security at the border, we want surveillance, we want a lot of things at the border. Ultimately, we don't want them to obstruct with the wall.

Just so you understand, we're renovating massive sections of wall right now, and eventually it will be brand new and we'll be able to use that.

DACA now, and the wall very soon. But the wall will happen. Thank you.

Say what?

To do what?

No, no.

We're not talking about that. We're not talking about amnesty at all. We have not talked about amnesty. They'll be no amnesty, we're not talking about that as part of the transaction.
