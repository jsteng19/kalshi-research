My fellow Americans. Melania and I are delighted to wish America and the entire world a very Merry Christmas.

In the season of joy, we spend time with our families. We renew the bonds of love and goodwill between our citizens, and most importantly we celebrate the miracle of Christmas. For Christians we remember the story of Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, that began more than 2,000 years ago.

As the Book of Isaiah tells us: "For to us a child is born. To us a son is given

This good news is the greatest Christmas gift of all, the reason for our joy, and the true source of our hope.

On behalf of Melania, myself, Barron, and the entire Trump family, God bless you, God bless America, and have a very, very Merry Christmas, and Happy New Year.
