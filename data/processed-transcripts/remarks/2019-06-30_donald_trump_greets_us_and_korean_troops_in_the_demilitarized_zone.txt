So, I want to thank you very much. You're a very special group of people. I just look at you, look how healthy and how strong and how good. And we really appreciate it. We appreciate it very much.

So this was a scheduled visit from a number of months ago. We went from the G20, and I promised your President, President Moon, who is a friend of mine -- I said, "We have to see the DMZ." And so this was scheduled for a long time ago. And then, yesterday, I had the idea, "Maybe I'll call Chairman Kim and see if he wants to say hello." So we didn't give him much notice, but we've become -- we respect each other.

We respect each other. Maybe even like each other. And he's agreed to meet. And I'm going to meet him in about four minutes. So I'm going to cut my speech a little bit short, other than to say you are terrific people. You've done a fantastic job. And we're with you all the way. You know that. What do you have over there? That looks good.

Oh? Who's a golfer? Huh?

I'll use it.

Thank you. Thank you very much.

I'll be thinking about you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. That's great.
