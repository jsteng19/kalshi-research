Well, Justin has been really great and I appreciate, you know... Justin has agreed to cut all tariffs  of all trade barriers between Canada and the United States, so I'm very happy right now.

But we're actually working on it. We are actually working on it. But our relationship is very good. We are actually working on cutting tariffs and making it all very fair for both countries, and we've made a lot of progress today. We'll see how it all works out, but we've made a lot of progress.

It could be that NAFTA a different form. It could be with Canada, with Mexico, one-on-one, a much simpler agreement, much easier to do. I think better for both countries, but we're talking about that, among other things. But the relationship is probably better, as good or better than it's ever been, and I think we'll get to something very beneficial to Canada and to the United States.

We didn't, we didn't discuss it, we didn't cover it.

I think we'll have a joint statement.
