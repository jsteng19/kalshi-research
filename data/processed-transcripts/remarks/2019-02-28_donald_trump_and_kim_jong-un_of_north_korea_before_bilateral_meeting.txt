Are you all having a good time in Hanoi? Everybody having a good time? Everybody? Jeff? I hope.

That's a good answer. Wow. That might be the best answer you've ever heard.

And don't raise your voice, please. This isn't like dealing with Trump.

I think they're anxious and they're calm.

We're discussing everything. So I just want to thank everybody for being here. We're having very productive discussions. We'll see where it all goes. But we are having very productive discussions, and we appreciate it. I think we're having a press conference later on, and we'll then be heading out back to our respective homes.

I think that no matter what happens, we're going to ultimately have a deal that's really good for Chairman Kim and his country, and for us. I think, ultimately, that's what's going to happen. That's where it's all leading. It doesn't mean we're doing it in one day or two days, but it's all leading toward a very -- a very big success.

And I really believe that, with this great leadership, I really believe that North Korea is going to be very successful, and economically, it's going to be something very, very special. Go ahead.

Yeah, I think we will. I think we will. It's actually an interesting question though. I would like to actually hear that answer, because it's actually not a bad idea.

I actually think it's a good idea. Both ways. You know, both ways.

Thank you all very much. Thank you very much.
