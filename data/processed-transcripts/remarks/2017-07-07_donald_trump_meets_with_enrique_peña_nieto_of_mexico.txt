Thank you very much. We've all had a very successful day and a very interesting day. It's great to be with my friend, the President of Mexico. And we're negotiating NAFTA and some other things with Mexico, and we'll see how it all turns out. But I think we've made very good progress. So, it's great to be with you. Thank you.

Thank you. Thank you very much.

Absolutely.
