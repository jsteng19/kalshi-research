Well, and also a great speech you made today. Really, I watched it, a really great speech. Thank you very much. And you too, my friend, great speech. You did a great job, pounding on that table. They said, how would you like to deal with him all your life? It's not easy.

You did a great job. Thank you very much. Thank you, everybody. We're going to work very hard on this. This is going to be -- this is my most important meeting.

I've had important meetings. I don't want to insult anybody that we've met with, and we met with because I had 32 meetings here, but this is the one that's very important to me because we're going to end something that should have probably never started. Thank you very much, everybody. We appreciate it. Thank you.
