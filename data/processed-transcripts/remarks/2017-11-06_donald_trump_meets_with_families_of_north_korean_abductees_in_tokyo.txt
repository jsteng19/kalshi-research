Well, thank you very much. We've just heard the very sad stories about family members -- daughters, wives, brothers, uncles, fathers. It's a very, very sad number of stories that we've heard. And they were abducted, in all cases, by North Korea. And we will work with Prime Minister Abe on trying to get them back to their loved ones.

In some cases, many years ago, they were taken. They were used to learn the language. They were used for many different reasons. But it's a tremendous disgrace. And I just met some really wonderful people who have gone through a lot.

So I will work with Prime Minister Abe. We'll work together very closely and see if we can bring them back to Japan, where they want to be. Thank you very much.
