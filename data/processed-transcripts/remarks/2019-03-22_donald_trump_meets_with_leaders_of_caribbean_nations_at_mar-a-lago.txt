I appreciate very much you all being here. We look forward to seeing you downstairs. And, First Lady, thank you very much. You've done a great job. Appreciate it. Thank you very much everybody.

Thank you very much. We're honored to be with some terrific people that have been friends of mine -- in many cases, friends of mine. They've done a wonderful job in their respective countries. And we'll be talking about many subjects -- trade; we always talk about trade. But we'll also be discussing, I have a feeling, Venezuela. That may come up in our conversation. It's become a very big topic all over the world -- Venezuela. And we look forward to spending a lot of time together this afternoon and discussing ways that we can be beneficial to you and you can be beneficial to us. And we very much appreciate your being at Mar-a-Lago. It's a great honor.  Thank you very much. Thank you everybody. If you'd like to say something to the media, they will start with you.

Correct.

Very good. Thank you. Please.
