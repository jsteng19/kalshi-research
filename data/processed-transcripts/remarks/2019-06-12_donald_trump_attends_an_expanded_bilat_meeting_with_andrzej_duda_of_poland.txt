Thank you very much. We have a highly respected person with us, the President of Poland, and the highest representatives of Poland. And we've had some tremendous discussions having to do with trade and military and lots of other things. And they continue. Secretary Perry is discussing a very, very big transaction with Poland.

One of the biggest. And we are very prepared to go forward with that, Rick, as you know. And it will be very, very important for both nations, maybe in particular for your nation. And I think you're right in what you're doing. I'd like to ask Secretary Pompeo maybe to say a few words. I know you're dealing very well and successfully with your representative from Poland.

Good. Thank you, Mike. And, Wilbur, do you have anything to say?

I think a deficit.

Right.

Thank you very much. Mr. Secretary?

It's true. Buy American.

It's true. We appreciate it.

Good. Thank you. And I see our ambassador. She's doing a good job, I'll bet. I've known Georgette for a long time.

Georgette? How's it going?

Thank you. Keep up the good work, Georgette.

Rick Perry?

Well, Rick, Poland is a very, very large purchaser now of the LNG, and they are getting it by the billions, actually. We're signing contracts for billions and billions of dollars. And that's great. And we have a lot of it. We have a lot of it. So we very much appreciate it. And I see our great Secretary of Homeland Security.

Now, why aren't you on the Mexican border today?  What are you doing here with Poland?

Good. And how are we doing on the other border -- that southern border that we talk about all the time?

And if we had the Democrats, we could solve the problem in 15 minutes with the loopholes and the asylum, right?

Right. I know you did. And you did it well. John Bolton, please.

Okay. Oh, good. That's -- . Mr. President, please.

You never know. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you, everybody. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Thank you.

It'll be great.

We'll talk about that later.
