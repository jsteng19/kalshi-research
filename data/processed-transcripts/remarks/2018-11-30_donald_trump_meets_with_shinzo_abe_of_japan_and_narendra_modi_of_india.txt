Thank you very much. It's a great honor to be with Prime Minister Modi of India, and, as you know, Prime Minister Abe of Japan. And we just had a great meeting, and we're having now what we call a "trilat."

The relationships between our three countries is extremely -- extremely good, extremely strong. I think, with India, maybe stronger than ever. And with Japan, I think, stronger than ever. We're doing very well together. We're doing a lot of trade together. We're doing a lot of defense together, a lot of military purchases.

And we're going to now have a little discussion between the three of us. So thank you very much. Mr. Prime Minister.

Thank you very much.

We had no discussion. We had no discussion. We might, but had none.

Thank you very much everybody.
