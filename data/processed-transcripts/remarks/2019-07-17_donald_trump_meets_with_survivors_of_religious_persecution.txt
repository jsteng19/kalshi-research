Good afternoon. We'll be leaving for North Carolina in a short while. I think some of you will be outside. Tremendous crowds in North Carolina. Tremendous crowds everywhere. But we have a very important group of people standing alongside of me. I'm honored to welcome Pastor Andrew Brunson and other survivors of religious persecution to the White House.

We're grateful to be joined by Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom Sam Brownback -- a former governor, as you know; as well as Pastor Paula White -- a tremendous religious leader and a friend of the White House, a friend of the presidency, and a friend of the President. With us today are men and women of many different religious traditions from many different countries.

But what you have in common is each of you has suffered tremendously for your faith. You've endured harassment, threats, attacks, trials, imprisonment, and torture. I got to know many of you and helped you get some -- get some of you out of the difficult situation that you were in. I'm very proud of you in the way you've reacted to a different life.

It is a tremendous thing. Your families are very proud, and our country is very proud, and your countries are very proud -- for those of you that aren't from the United States. Each of you has now become a witness to the importance of advancing religious liberty all around the world. It's about religious liberty.

Last year, my administration hosted the world's first-ever meeting of foreign ministers devoted solely to the subject of international religious freedom. I want to thank all of you for joining us as we host this meeting for the second year in a row. A lot of individual breakout meetings are being had, and we're getting a lot of ideas as to how we can help.

In America, we've always understood that our rights come from God, not from government. In our Bill of Rights, the first liberty is religious liberty. Each of us has the right to follow the dictates of our conscience and the demands of our religious conviction. We know that if people are not free to practice their faith, then all of the freedoms are at risk and, frankly, freedoms don't mean very much.

That's why Americans will never tire in our effort to defend and promote religious freedom. I don't think any President has taken it as seriously as me. To me, it's very important. It's vital. It's really vital. And I just want to thank everybody very much for being with us today. You've been through a lot.

And I think I can say it for everyone here: You've been through a lot -- more than most people could ever endure. And I want to congratulate you because that's what you need, is congratulations. It's really an honor to be with you, and I will stand side by side with you forever. If I could ask Ambassador Brownback to say a few words, please.

Thank you.

That's right.

Wow.

We got you out. That's good. That's great.

You're feeling good? Everything fine?

Good.

Okay. Congratulations.

Yes. Yes. We did something. Thank you. Appreciate it very much. Thank you very much. Ambassador, so which is more important? You were the governor of a great state -- a very, very top state, in my opinion. And you're doing, now, something for religious liberty and freedom. Which is tougher and which is more important to you?

It's really something.

So when you say other countries are coming along -- and some aren't coming along, I assume. Right?

Some are not doing much. Who are the good ones? I won't talk about the bad ones because I know who the bad ones are. Who are the good ones?

That's great.

That's good.

You're doing a great job. Thank you very much.

Paula White? Could you say a few words, Paula, please?

Support, yeah.

No, it's fine.

Thank you very much.

Please say hello. Please say hello. Okay?

Thank you very much. I appreciate it. And your English is actually very good.

Thank you.

Your husband is in prison.

And where is this, now? Where? Where is your husband a prisoner?

He -- did you say he died?

Yes. I understand.

I appreciate it.

Thank you very much.

Thank you very much. Thank you. You take care of yourself. Paula?

I heard that was incredible.

Thank you. And I did hear that they had thousands of people that couldn't get in yesterday.

That's incredible. Wow. I'm sure we'll get a much bigger room, I guess, or a tent or something.

Yes, please.

Thank you very much.

Well, thank you very much. And you went through a lot. I know all about what happened, and that was a terrible situation. Thank you very much for being here. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.

Yes, please.

That's true.

No? Come on.

Where is that? Where is that in China?

How long? How long has your father been gone?

Do you have any communication with him?

That's tough stuff. Go ahead please.

And where is that, exactly? Where?

I see.

Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it. Yes, please.

Yes.

How has it been in Cuba without Castro? There's still a Castro there, but you have a new leader. How has that been? Any different?

I see. All right. Thank you. Thank you. Yes, please. Go ahead.

Thank you very much. Thank you.

It's tough stuff, right?

That's a tough one. Thank you.

Yes. Please. Go ahead.

Thank you. Thank you.

I'm understanding exactly what you're saying. I'll bring it up. Yes, please.

And you were captured?

But ISIS is gone?

And now it's Kurdish and --

Where are they now?

I know the area very well, you're talking about. It's a tough -- yeah.

Okay. Well, we'll continue very strong.

Thank you. And you had the Nobel Prize?

That's incredible. They gave it to you for what reason? They can explain.

Oh really? Is that right?

It's the first time?

So you escaped.

I understand.

Let me look. We're going to look, okay? Thank you very much.

Yes, ma'am. Go ahead. Thank you.

Good.

Well, thank you very much. The world is a -- the world is a tough place. Yes, please. Go ahead.

Thank you very much. Appreciate it.

In a shipping container.

Thirty-two. Thirty-two months. Please.

Thank you very much. So, you see, the world is a tough place. And we're making strides. We've made some very good strides. Andrew is a case in point -- Pastor Brunson, wherever you may be. And so I appreciate it. How has everything been for you since you got out?

Thank you, Andrew. I appreciate it very much.

Yes.

What is happening? Explain what is happening in Iran.

Right.

They were in jail for what reason? Because they're pastors?

Incredible. I will.

I'm going to get the information. I will.

Yes?

Vietnam?

Vietnam?

I appreciate that. I think I understood everything.

Thank you very much everybody. Thank you.

I know nothing about that. Thank you. Thank you very much.
