Thank you very much. It's a great honor to have the Emir of Qatar with us. He's a friend of mine -- knew him long before I entered the world of politics. He's a great gentleman. He's very popular in his country. His people love him. We're working on unity in that part of the Middle East, and I think it's working out very well. There are a lot of good things happening.

Also, we have a gentleman, on my right, who buys a lot of equipment from us. A lot of purchases in the United States, and a lot of military airplanes, missiles -- lots of different things. But they've been great friends in so many ways. We're working very well together, and I think it's working out extremely well. So, Emir, thank you very much for being here. Appreciate it.

Thank you.

Thank you. And Tamim and I have been working for a number of years now -- actually, even before the fact -- on terrorism. And we're making sure that terrorism funding is stopped in the countries that we are really related to -- because I feel related. But those countries are stopping the funding of terrorism, and that includes UAE; it includes Saudi Arabia; it includes Qatar and others.

A lot of countries were funding terrorism and we're stopping it. It's getting stopped and fast. Very important. And you've now become a very big advocate, and we appreciate that.

Thank you very much. Thank you.
