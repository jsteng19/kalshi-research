Okay, thank you very much, everybody. And we'll be having a meeting largely based on trade -- President of Switzerland and representatives from Switzerland. And we have a tremendous relationship. We're working on other matters also that are very interesting. But today we're going to be discussing largely trade with Switzerland.

They'd like to do an agreement, and we'll see what we can do. And thank you all for being with us. Thank you very much.

Yes.

That's right. That's right.

Right.

Right. Wow. Good.

Good.

That's very good.

Sure.

Good.

We look forward to it.

Thank you. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you.

We had a very good conversation. It worked out very well. The U.S. is very happy with the result, and we appreciate very much what President Macron did. Thank you.
