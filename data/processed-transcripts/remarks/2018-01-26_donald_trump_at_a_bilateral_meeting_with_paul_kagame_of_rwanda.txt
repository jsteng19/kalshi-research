Thank you very much. It's a great honor to be with President Kagame. And we have had tremendous discussions on Rwanda, and the job they've done is absolutely terrific. We have trade with Rwanda, and just general, I would say great relationships.

I want to congratulate you, Mr. President, as being the new head of the African Union. That's a great honor. This was just announced recently, and that really, truly is a great honor. So please give my regards. I know you're going to your first meeting very shortly, and please give my warmest regards. But it's an honor to have you as a friend.

Sure.

Well, I thank you very much. And it's a great honor to have all of you here. And we'll speak for a little bit longer. And thank you very much. Thank you for being here.
