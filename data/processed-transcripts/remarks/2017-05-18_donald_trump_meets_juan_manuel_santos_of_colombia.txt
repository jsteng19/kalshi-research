Well, it's a great honor to have President Santos of Colombia here. We will have long discussions today. Colombia has been making great progress, but we are working on knocking out the drugs, because we have a problem with drugs, and you have a very big problem with drugs, and we're working very hard and very diligently and we'll be spending a lot of time together today and I know in the future a lot of time. And Mr. President, it's an honor to have you with us. Thank you so much.

We will talk about Venezuela... we will, we will be, we will be talking about Venezuela.

We're very close to an FBI director.

Soon, very soon.

He is.

It's very sad. What's happening in Venezuela is very, very sad. Thank you all very much. Thank you.
