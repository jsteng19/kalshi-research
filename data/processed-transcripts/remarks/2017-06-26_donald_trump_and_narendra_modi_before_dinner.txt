Thank you very much. Mr. Prime Minister, we'll do the toasts as soon as the media leaves.  Were going to have a very special toast, a very intimate toast.

But again, I want to thank you and all of your representatives. It is such an honor to have you at the White House and in Washington. And we have had tremendous meetings today, tremendous success, and we enjoy a wonderful relationship, but its never been better than it is today.

And again, any time youd like, we want to have you back as soon as possible. Thank you very much for being here.

Thank you very much. Thank you. You know, the Prime Minister was going to come here at a different time, but we worked out this time because they had elections in a section of India. And its just a small section, but we said, its the seventh largest country in the world, that small section of India.

So I said, you know what, this is a better day.  But it is great to have you. Thank you very much. Thank you all for being here. Thank you very much.

Good.

Thats fantastic. Thats a good win indeed. You won by a lot. Thank you all. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much.
