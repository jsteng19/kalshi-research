Thank you very much. It's great to have Prime Minister May from the United Kingdom and her representatives, who are people we know very well through recent trade negotiations.

I have to say, we'll be doing a lot of trading with the United Kingdom, and we look forward to it. And we have gotten to know each other over the last period of a year, and it's a real honor to have you here. Thank you very much.

Well, thank you very much for being here.
