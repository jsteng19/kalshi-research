Well, thank you very much. It's a great honor to have the King and Queen of Spain, a beautiful country. We were in Spain not so long ago, and we love it. Very special people and a beautiful place.

And our relationship has been outstanding over the years and, I think, especially right now. Excellent trade relationship, military relationship. Just about everything you can have. So we love Spain. And it's really a tremendous honor to have you both at the Oval Office. Thank you very much.

That's true.

Thank you very much. It's a great honor.

Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much.

Yes. I will go to Spain. I will be going to Spain. Yes.

Thank you.
