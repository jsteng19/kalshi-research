Well, thank you very much. We're having a very exciting month in Washington, D.C. There haven't been too many like it. I will say this: We have the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.  And the stock market, as you probably have heard -- all those 401(k)s and all of those jobs out there -- the stock market just hit a brand-new high.

That will be 129 records that we have in, really, fairly much -- substantially less than three years. So, that's something. Our country is doing really great. I want to thank everybody for being here. I want to thank our great Vice President and Karen for being with us. Where's Mike? Thank you.

Thank you, Karen. Thank you. And I want to congratulate Melania. She did such a beautiful job with the decorations. She did such a beautiful job. We're very proud of this country. We're very proud of this home. We call it a home; some Presidents called it a house. And some Presidents called it much worse than a house, I will say.

But we love the White House. It's a special place. And our country is a special country. I just want to thank you. We're going to come down and mingle and see everybody. We'll spend some time here. Have a good time tonight. But Happy New Year, Merry Christmas, Happy Hanukkah. We're going to have a fantastic year.

We're going to have the best year we've had in many, many decades. This is -- we're set up for one great, big, beautiful success. Thank you all for being here. Thank you for being with us. Thank you very much. Thank you.
