So thank you very much everybody. This is very special. Charles Q. -- I like that -- Q. Brown, Jr. And you family is very proud of you. Your wife is very proud, your sons are very proud, and I'm very proud. And I'm proud to have you in the Oval Office. This was going to be in a different location, and there's only one Oval Office. I said, "This is the big leagues, and we have to have you and your family over to celebrate." This is an incredible occasion.

There's only one thing I worry about: Charles was confirmed 98 to nothing. That makes me a little bit concerned, right? Ninety-eight -- . I've never heard -- I've never heard that before. You understand what that means: 98 to nothing. So that's an achievement.

But you have had an incredible career, and this is a capper, and I just want to congratulate you. And it's an honor to have you in this very fabled office and to have you in the White House. And thank you very much for being here, and congratulations to you and your family on a job well done.

Fantastic job. Thank you. Thank you very much.

First of all, would you like to say something, Charles?

Right. Right.

It's a great family.

Well, you know, this is your last chance to get out of it, okay?  Because in another minute, that won't happen, right? This is it. Okay.

Well, you're a great gentleman, a great man, and congratulations. And to you family: It's an amazing achievement. Amazing achievement. Thank you very much.

Please, Mike.

Fantastic. Thank you very much.

Secretary of Defense, maybe you'd like to say something, please? You know each other very well.

Yes.

Isn't that great. Beautiful. That's very nice. Thank you. And you have done a fantastic job. Thank you very much.

Appreciate it.

Good luck. Go out there, and do it. Greatest country in the world. And you have all those brand-new F-35s; you have all that.  And you have equipment like you didn't have two or three years ago, I can tell you.

Congratulations.

Congratulations, everybody.
