Thank you very much. It's a great honor to have Prime Minister Lee of Singapore with us and his representatives at the highest level. We've just signed an order with Boeing for almost $14 billion worth of airplanes. We do a lot of business with Singapore.

The relationship now is at its highest point and it will continue. It will continue. So, Mr. Prime Minister, thank you very much. It's an honor to have you in the White House.

Thank you.

That's because they buy Boeing, right?  That's great. Thank you very much. Thank you, everybody. Thank you very much.
