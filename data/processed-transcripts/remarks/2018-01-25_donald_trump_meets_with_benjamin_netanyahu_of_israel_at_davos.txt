Thank you very much. It's great to be with Prime Minister Netanyahu. We've developed a great relationship, both as countries where I think it's never been stronger -- and I can honestly say that -- and also, as personal friends.

We have discussions going with Israel on many things, including trade. But the big move and something that was very historic and very important was the fact that we will be moving our embassy, as you know, to Jerusalem.

And as we also know, that is way ahead of schedule, by years, and we anticipate having a small version of it opened sometime next year. So that's a long time ahead of schedule. It's an honor, and it's great honor to be with you. Thank you very much.

Thank you very much.

Thank you very much, Bibi. Thank you. My honor.

I have to say, on the United Nations, we were pretty much out in the wilderness by ourselves -- the United States. And we heard every country was going to be against us. And it was very interesting. I said, you know, we give billions and billions of dollars to these countries.

It amounts to hundreds of millions, and sometimes into the billions for certain countries, and they vote against us. And I made a very simple statement that I'm watching. I'm watching. And we ended up getting 68 votes, either "yes"" or ""we'll take a neutral position

Which was essentially a "yes

You know, if you look back at the various peace proposals -- and they are endless -- and I spoke to some of the people involved, and I said, "Did you ever talk about the vast amounts of funds, money that we give to the Palestinians?" We give, you know, hundreds of millions of dollars. And they said, "We never talk." Well, we do talk about it.

And when they disrespected us a week ago by not allowing our great Vice President to see them -- and we give them hundreds of millions of dollars in aid and support -- tremendous numbers; numbers that nobody understands. That money is on the table, and that money is not going to them unless they sit down and negotiate peace. Because I can tell you that Israel does want to make peace. And they're going to have to want to make peace too, or we're going to have nothing to do with it any longer.

This was never brought up by other negotiators, but it's brought up by me. So I will say that the hardest subject they had to talk about was Jerusalem. We took Jerusalem off the table, so we don't have to talk about it anymore. They never got past Jerusalem. We took it off the table. We don't have to talk about it anymore. You won one point, and you'll give up some points later on in the negotiation, if it ever takes place. I don't know that it ever will take place.

But they have to respect the process also, and they have to respect the fact that the U.S. has given tremendous support to them over the years, in terms of monetary support and other support. So we'll see what happens with the peace process, but respect has to be shown to the U.S. or we're just not going any further. Thank you all very much. Thank you very much, everybody.

Steve, go ahead. Speak up, Steve. That's not like you.

We'll see what happens. Yes, we have a proposal for peace. It's a great proposal for the Palestinians. I think it's a very good proposal for Israel. It covers a lot of the things that were, over the years, discussed and agreed on. But the fact is -- and I think you know this better than anybody -- there were never any deals that came close, because Jerusalem -- you could never get past Jerusalem.

So when people said, "Oh

No, I didn't really read his remarks, personally. I think I'm probably better off not seeing them. But we've done a lot for them, and hopefully they're going to make peace for their people.

You know what, it's many years of killing people. It's many years of killing each other. They have to be tired and disgusted of it. So let's see what happens. I think, eventually, very sound minds -- I hope sound minds -- are going to prevail. And it would be a great achievement of mine. I've said it from day one, if we could make peace between Israel and the Palestinians -- if we do that, I would consider that one of our truly great achievements.

But the money is on the table. The money was never on the table. I'll tell you up front, we give them tremendous amounts -- hundreds of millions of dollars a year. That money is on the table. Because why should we do that, as a country, if they're doing nothing for us? And what we want to do for them is help them. We want to create peace and save lives. And we'll see what happens. We'll see what happens. But the money is on the table. Thank you very much.

Any time they want. Any time they want.
