It's our great honor to have President and Mrs. Varela from Panama. We have may things to discuss. We're going to spend quite a bit of time today. Panama Canal is doing quite well, I think we did a good job building it, right?

But, things are going well in Panama. The relationship has been very strong. We are developing new things to do, and only getting stronger. And our, also, friendship with the President is very good. So, I just want to thank you very much and say it's an honor to have you at the White House.

Thank you very much everybody.
