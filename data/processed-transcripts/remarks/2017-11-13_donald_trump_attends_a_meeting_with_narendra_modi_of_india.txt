It's great to have Prime Minister Modi here. We've had him at the White House, and he's become a friend of ours and a great gentleman doing a fantastic job in bringing around lots of factions in India -- bringing them all together. That's what I hear, and that's good news. And it really is. It's a lot of good reports coming out of India. So I want to congratulate you.

But it's an honor to be with you. We're rounding the turn for our last couple of stops. I have a couple of more today. And then tomorrow we have the conference, and then we leave at about three o'clock.

And it's been a great 12 days. We've had 12 days -- I don't know how many days have you had there. How long --

Well, we've been doing this for 12 days, and we've really enjoyed it. And a lot of great things have happened for our country and, I think, for the world. A lot of elements were solved or in the process of being solved. But it's a great honor to be with you, Mr. Prime Minister. Thank you. Thank you very much.

Thank you very much. Thank you.
