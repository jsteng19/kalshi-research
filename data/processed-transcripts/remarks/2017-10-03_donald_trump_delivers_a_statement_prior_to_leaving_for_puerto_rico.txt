Look, we have a tragedy, we're gonna do... and what happened in Las Vegas is in many ways a miracle. The police department has done such an incredible job, and we'll be talking about gun laws as time goes by.

But I do have to say how quickly the police department was able to get in was really very much of a miracle. They've done an amazing job. Go ahead.

Well, I think she's come back a long way, and you know I think it's now acknowledged what a great job we've done, and people are looking at that. And in Texas and in Florida we get an A+ and I'll tell you what: I think we've done just as good in Puerto Rico, and it's actually a much tougher situation.

But now the roads are clear, communications starting to come back. We need their truck drivers, Their drivers have to start driving trucks. We have to do that.

So, at a local level, they have to give us more help, but I will tell you, the first responders, the military, FEMA.

They have done an incredible job in Puerto Rico and whether it's her or anybody else, they're all starting to say it. I appreciate very much the governor and his comments. He has said we have done an incredible job and that's the truth.

We'll talk about that later.

He was a sick man, a demented man, a lot of problems. I guess and we're looking into him very, very seriously, but we're dealing with a very, very sick individual. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
