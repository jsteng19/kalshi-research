Well, thank you very much. We have Prime Minister Lee, a highly respected man. Singapore, doing well; continues to do well. You never even see a downturn in Singapore, so -- I guess you don't agree with that.  But I would say looking from the outside, you never see a downturn.

I just want to congratulate you on having done a fantastic job. The relationship that we've had over the years has been very good, but it's never been closer than now. And we'll be spending a lot of time.

One of the things we'll be doing in a short period time is signing, together, a very large contract where Singapore is buying billions of dollars' worth of airplanes from Boeing that will be made in our country.

So that's jobs. And you're also buying the best plane, by the way. So that's very good. So I just want to thank Prime Minister Lee. Thank you very much.

That's very good. I think it will never be stronger.

And I'll be going over to that part of the world in two weeks, and stopping in numerous countries, including, as you know, Japan, South Korea, China. We're going to be stopping in Vietnam and probably the Philippines also. So it will be a very busy 10 or 11 days.

Very good. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you, everybody.

Very close, thanks.

Very, very close.
