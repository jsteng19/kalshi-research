Do you want to start ?

Well we do, and the Prime Minister and I worked very hard together in NATO, and it was an incredible two days I think. It's never been more united. People are paying. We are two of the five that are totally paid up, but others are coming along rapidly. I think it was a very, very productive two days, and we arrived here last night.

We had a dinner where I think we'd probably never developed a better relationship than the last time we spoke. We spoke for an hour, an hour and a half, and it was really something, and today we're talking trade, we're talking military.

We just looked at some incredible anti-terrorism, things that are being done here in conjunction with United States, and the relationship is very, very strong. We really had a very good relationship, and I think we're going to do a news conference in a little while.

So we'll answer your questions then, and right now we're going to be talking about some other things that are taking place in the Middle East and elsewhere. Okay? Thank you all very much. Thank you.
