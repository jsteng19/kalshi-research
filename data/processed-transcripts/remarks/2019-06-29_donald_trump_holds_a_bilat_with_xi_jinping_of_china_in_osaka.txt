Thank you very much, Mr. President. We have had a lot of time together, and we've become friends. My trip to Beijing with my family was one of the most incredible of my life. I've seen a culture that rarely would you see. Chinese culture is an incredible culture. I look forward to working with you. As you know, we've had a excellent relationship, but we want to do something that will even it up with respect to trade.

I think it's something that's actually very easy to do. I actually think that we were very close, and then we -- something happened where it slipped a little bit, and now we're getting a little bit closer. But it would be historic if we could do a fair trade deal. We're totally open to it, and I know you're totally open to it. I know all of your representatives have been working very hard with my representatives and the representatives of the United States.

And I will say that I think this can be a very productive meeting, and I think we can go on to do something that truly will be monumental and great for both countries, and that's what I look forward to doing. And thank you very much hosting us. We appreciate it. Thank you.

Thank you very much everybody. Thank you.

Thank you.
