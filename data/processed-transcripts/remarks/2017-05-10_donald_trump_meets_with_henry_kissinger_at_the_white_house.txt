Everybody knows Dr. Kissinger, and we're right now talking about Russia and various other matters. We're talking about Syria, and I think that we're going to do very well with respect to Syria. I think things are happening that are really, really, really positive. We're going to stop the killing and the death, and we had a very, very good meeting with Mr. Lavrov, and it was -- I thought it was very, very good.

What we want to do is, we want to see the killing, the horrible killing in Syria, stop as soon as possible, and everybody's working toward that end, but it's an honor to have Henry Kissinger with us. He's been a friend of mine for a long time, and thank you very much for being here, appreciate it.

Because he wasn't doing a good job, very simply. He was not doing a good job.

Excuse me?

Not at all.
