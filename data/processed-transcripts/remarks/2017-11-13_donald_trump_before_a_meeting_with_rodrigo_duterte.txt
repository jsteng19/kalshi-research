Yeah, I would. And I will say this: The media was a little bit late, and you actually missed the best part of the President's statement.  I think he should make it again, but it was good.

But we've had a great relationship. This has been very successful. We have many meetings today with many other leaders. And the ASEAN conference has been handled beautifully by the President in the Philippines and your representatives. And I've really enjoyed being here. The weather is always good. Today it's pretty good. But one thing about the Philippines -- eventually it gets good, no matter what.

But we very much appreciate the great treatment you've given us. I thought last night's event was fantastic. Tremendous talent -- most of it, I guess, from the Philippines. But tremendous talent -- musical talent, dance talent. And we really had a tremendous time, all of the leaders. So I think on behalf of everybody, I want to thank you and I want to thank the Philippines. Thank you very much.

Thank you very much.
