We have six incredible people who were held hostage by various countries, and I'm very pleased to let everybody know that we brought back over 50 hostages from 22 different countries. We work very hard on it, Ambassador O'Brien and others. I will tell you, we're very proud of the job we did, but I'd like to ask maybe Pastor Brunson to say a few words or we can go through and just give us a little history of what happened and how is life treating you?

Could have been there for 28 years, right? They had you scheduled for a long time, Andrew. We had to get you back. I have to say that to me, President Erdogan was very good. I know that had you scheduled for a long time and you were a very innocent person and ultimately, after we had a few conversations, he agreed.

So we appreciate that and we appreciate the people of Turkey and you still appreciate the people of Turkey. I understand. Right?

It's great to have you back, Andrew. Thank you. Please.

We got you back.

We got you all back and we have some more that we're working on right now to get back that we better do. Please, go ahead.

Thank you very much.

Please.

I know very well.

Well, the great people of Utah really wanted me to do something about the two of you. We were able to do it and a little bit of a miracle, I think, frankly.

Because that was a very hostile period, and we appreciate everybody working so hard with us, but we were able to get you both back. Are you living in Utah now, I hope?

That's good. Well, say hello to the folks in Utah because they are great people. Thank you very much. Congratulations.

Please.

Well, India responded very well to my request. So we appreciate that.

Thank you all for being with us. We have a few more people we want to get back and we will get them back and they'll be back very soon. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Great stories.
