Well, I haven't seen a manuscript, but I can tell you: Nothing was ever said to John Bolton. But I have not seen a manuscript. I guess he's writing a book. I have not seen it.

We'll talk inside.

Well, I think he's here for a reason. And, hopefully, that it will be "yes." And peace in the Middle East has been long sought for many, many, many years and decades and centuries. And this is an opportunity; we'll see what happens. Whatever it is, it is. But he's here for a reason.

We're going to see. We're going to announce tomorrow at 12 o'clock. We're going to show a plan that's been worked on by everybody, and we'll see whether or not it catches hold. If it does, that'd be great. And if doesn't, we can live with it, too. But I think it might have a chance.

Do I expect what?

He's coming here today. He'll be here also. And, as you know, they are two good competitors. They're fighting it out. I've been waiting now -- this is my third election. We keep waiting, and waiting, and waiting. So, let's go. What kind of a system is that? That's a very strange system you have over there.

Wouldn't you say that? Because we have been. We've been waiting -- we've been talking about this for many months and we keep waiting for the election. So that system has to be looked at.

Well, I think what's happening is -- one of the reasons that Mr. Gantz is here is for that reason. He's coming, too. So I'm going to speak to him right after this.

Thank you. It's my honor.

You're going to see very, very quickly. We're going to release a plan tomorrow at 12 o'clock. You're going to see for yourself. Okay. We'll see you inside.
