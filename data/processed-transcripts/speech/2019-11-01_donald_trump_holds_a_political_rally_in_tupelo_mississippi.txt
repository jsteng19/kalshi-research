Well, thank you very much and hello Tupelo. This is great to be with you tonight, the great state of Mississippi, the great state of Mississippi, and by the way, the birthplace of a gentleman, not too many people heard of him, Elvis Presley. But to be with thousands of incredible patriots who put their faith in God, family, and country.

Four days from now, this state will head to the polls and vote to continue our extraordinary progress with your next Governor, Republican Tate Reeves. Great guy. Under Republican leadership, jobs are booming, confidence is soaring, wages are rising, crime is falling, and our nation is stronger than ever before.

We're now an economic powerhouse. We've never been in a position like it, we've rebuilt our military, and we have financial strength. And by the way, for those of you with a thing called 401(k)s, the stock market hit today another all-time historic high. Unemployment in Mississippi has reached the lowest rate ever recorded, ever recorded.

That's not bad. That's not bad. When you're on the debate stage -- and you say we have the best economy we've ever had, we have the best military we've ever had, the best unemployment and employment numbers we've ever had. He said the best President we've ever had. Thank you.  Thank you very much.

And very importantly, we've confirmed more than 158 brand new beautiful federal judges to uphold our Constitution as written. In a very short while, we'll have 182 federal judges. President Obama left us 142. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, President Obama. He left us 142 openings. Can you believe that?

You're supposed to leave none when you leave office, but that didn't work out too well. And just days ago, the United States brought the world's number one terrorist leader to justice.  We have great military. It was very, very depleted. When I came into office it was very, very depleted, but it ain't depleted anymore.

Al Baghdadi, the founder, and leader -- look, you know, you've heard about him for a long time. I kept saying: where is al Baghdadi, that's the one I want. Where is he? And then, by the way, the following day we got number two. I don't know if you read about that, but he was the founder and the leader of ISIS, and he's dead.

And Baghdadi, he was a savage and soulless monster, but his reign of terror is over. American special operators executed a masterful raid that ended his wretched life and punched out his ticket to hell. I guess you could say. He spent his last miserable moments on earth, cowering and trembling, and crying in fear of the American warrior that was right there, going right up. No enemy stands a chance against the righteous might of the United States military.

And Mississippi loves our military, that I can tell you, and our military loves Mississippi. America is winning again and America is all over the world, respected again. It's about time. But while we're creating jobs and killing terrorists, the Democrat Party has gone completely insane.  The radical left is determined to transform America into a country you would not recognize.

We are the ones standing in their way and we will never get out of their way. It will be easy. From even before we won the election, the far-left Democrats and the fake news media, right back there. Look at all of them. Oh.  It's too bad we didn't get such good ratings because if we didn't, they wouldn't be here.

Look at how many. It's like the Academy Awards before it failed, right? And do you know why it failed? Because they disrespected us. But the media and the Democrats have been engaged in a corrupt partnership trying to impose their will and to thwart American democracy by any means necessary. You see what's going on. First, they engineered the Russia hoax.

That was a total hoax. The single greatest lies ever foisted upon the American people. Then, the Muller witch hunt. It never ended. With 18 angry Democrats and an unlimited budget. Let's go get him. That didn't work out too well, did it? That fizzled. And a lot of bad people along the way. And now, corrupt politicians, Nancy Pelosi  and shifty Adam Schiff, shifty, and the media are continuing with the deranged impeachment witch hunt.

This is one I never thought I'd be involved in. The word impeachment to me, it's a dirty word, not a good word, totally phony deal, they know it, everybody knows it. And that's why we've never had greater support than we have right now. It's true. It's true. And if you think you have a lot of people in this room, all you have to do is go outside.

You'll see a lot more people trying to get in. So, if anybody wants to give up your seat, please just walk out -- anybody wants to leave? Because there really is, there's no place better to have a rally, to have a good time, and also, at the same time, be very serious, than at a Trump rally, especially on Friday night in Mississippi.

We could have done this one on a Monday night, I said let's do Friday, right? Friday. Yesterday, the Democrats voted to potentially nullify the votes of 63 million Americans disgracing themselves and bringing shame upon the House of Representatives.  They've been plotting to overthrow the election since the moment I won.

But the people here that are highly sophisticated, know long before, I won. 19 minutes after I took the oath of office, the horrible newspaper, fake, fake, fake Washington Post, declared the campaign to impeach President Trump has just begun. At least they gave us 19 minutes. Yesterday's vote by the radical Democrats is an attack on Democracy itself.

But I'll tell you, the Republicans are really strong. The strongest I've ever seen them. The most unified I've ever seen them. The American people are fed up with Democrat lies, hoaxes, and extremism. The Democrats' outrageous conduct has created an angry majority that will vote many do-nothing Democrats out of office in 2020. Make no mistake.

They are coming after the Republican Party and me because I'm fighting for you, they don't like it, this is different. They've never had anything like this. Well, they've never had an election like 2016 either, have they? They've never had. They've never quite figured it out. And they know they can't win.

So, let's try and impeach him. How about that crazy Representative Al Green, right? You know, we've got to impeach him because we can't beat him. I don't think so, right? I don't think so. Al Green, he's another beauty. The Democrats, the media, and the deep state are desperate to stop us. And it's not me, it's us, it's all of us. It's 63 million but it's much more than 63 million, much more, and right now, our numbers are higher than they've ever been before.

So, you know if they've never been -- they've never been this. But they want to stop us because they know we are here and that's what we're doing, and that's what's taken up so much time. We're draining the swamp in Washington. Nothing terrifies Democrats more than the fact that all of their spying, spying.

They actually spied on my campaign. Can you believe it? I mean, you know, they try to say well, we were actually just checking things out. Oh, that's wonderful. The lying, the falsifying over the past three years. Plus, before I ever even announced they were spying. I guess, they knew we were going to win, right?

But over that past more than three years is finally being exposed. And remember this, the truth is a force of nature. Desperate to conceal their misdeeds, the Democrats are now attacking us for calling out the grave corruption of the Bidens. Just like they melted down when we pointed out crooked Hillary's shocking and very many misdeeds.

33,000 e-mails, 33,000 e-mails disappeared, but she said they only had to do with her working out and her daughter's wedding.  She's a beauty. How about last week, did you hear? I don't know who Tulsi Gabbard is, but I know one thing, she's, not an agent of Russia. And Jill Stein, she's a greenie, that's fine.

We love the environment, everybody in this room. You know right now, we have the cleanest air and the cleanest water that we've ever had, and yet, we're No. 1 in the world in energy by far. We took over. But I don't know Jill Stein, she ran last time. I don't know, but I know she's not an agent of Russia.

And when Hillary made those statements, two statements, both of them, they work for Russia, they're agents of Russia. I said you know when she made that statement about me three years ago, it took me two years to get out of that hoax statement. She made it about them, everybody laughed because of what we proved.

But I'll tell you what, these are very bad people. These are very dishonest people, and the media is worse than all of them. But think about the preposterous hoax the Democrats are now trying to peddle. I've just beaten with no political -- look, look, we didn't have too much political experience. I did a good job.

Built lots of buildings all over the place, had great success in show business, just did one show it's called The Apprentice and it was a big success, 14 seasons. And when I left, Crazy Arnold took over. It didn't do too well. It was dead. It was dead from the first episode. I saw him. I said, oh, it's terrible.

What have they done to this beautiful show, Arnold? But think of it. I've just beaten with no political experience, the Clinton dynasty, the Bush dynasty, the President Barack-Hussein-Obama dynasty , and President Obama worked harder at defeating me than crooked Hillary Clinton did, right?

He was all over the place. The only time I've actually seen him work hard when it came to trying to beat Trump. It's true. Remember he said, remember he said, he will not be President. Well, that didn't work out so well. And then, they figured they could take us out a different way, very dishonestly, right?

With the lying, and the spying, and the leaking, and we are kicking their ass, I'll tell you. In the delusional Democrat fantasy, I'm now supposed to be afraid of someone called 1% Joe. I used to call him 1% because he could never get 1% percent in the primaries. Then, he got brought out by Obama out of the trash heap, became Vice President, but we've now named him very slow sleepy Joe, very slow, he's gotten slower and slower.

I'm afraid if he gets the nomination, he'll be so slow. We'll have the lowest-rated debates in history, as opposed to the highest-rated debates in history, against crooked Hillary. In fact, I don't even think that sleepy Joe will get it, but many people are running. So, you know, it's so early. I don't want to talk about their campaign.

Oh, did you hear Beto, Beto? Oh, that poor bastard. Well. Poor, pathetic guy. He was pathetic. Remember the arms are flailing. It's all -- remember that -- you know, he ran against Ted Cruz. Ted Cruz won. He spent almost $100 million, and Ted Cruz and I helped Ted, and we campaigned together, and it was good, but I used to watch him.

Then, when he came on to the really big stage, this crazy stage, I noticed he was flailing with the arms and he was standing on tables, he was standing on countertops. I said does he ever, like, stand on the floor and speak? But he's waving his arms and going crazy, and I said what the hell is he doing? What is he on? And you remember he made the statement that he was born for this.

Anybody that says, he was born for this, they're in trouble. You know, I used to have guys come into my office, sir, I'm the greatest salesman. Nobody can sell -- you know, the truth is, anybody that says they're a great salesman, usually, they're, not a very good salesman. It's true. It's those sneaky ones in the back that don't talk, but you don't know about -- they're the ones.

But Beto was nasty and he said that he was born for it. Like he was born from heaven and he came down. And if that's the case, some really bad things happened because he made a total fool out of himself. And he came out of Texas, the great state of Texas. He came out of Texas, a very hot political property and he went back as cold as you can be. So, he was a nasty guy.

But he had a couple of policies that don't work well in the state of Texas, right? He was against religion, he was against you having a gun , and he was against oil. So, you come from Texas, you don't like religion, you don't like oil, and you don't have guns. I don't know, that's not a good combination in the state of Texas.

That's not good in Mississippi either. I don't know is that good -- is that good anyway. Now, he went back home to Texas, and hopefully, we won't be hearing about him for a long time. It's amazing how cold you can get so quickly, but he was a nasty guy. But in the twisted -- oh, Alabama. I love Alabama, I love Alabama.

It's a great place. But in the very twisted and corrupt world of Adam Schiff, after beating the entire political establishment, and that means Bush, and that means Clinton, and that means Obama. They have me supposedly saying to myself. Well, let's see, I got a guy named sleepy Joe Biden. How do I beat him?

How do I beat him? How do I beat this guy? He's such a great -- Clinton, she was easy, right? Obama was easy. The Bush dynasty was easy, but sleepy Joe I'm worried about, right? So then, I said to myself, gee, I guess, there's only one way. Let's call up Ukraine for help. These people are sick. These people are sick.

Now, these dishonest people will take the last little sliver and the first little sliver, and they'll put it because they're so damned dishonest, and they'll say let's use Ukraine for help. That's what they're going to say. And they won't show the laughter, and they won't show the sarcasm, and they won't show the fun because they're the most dishonorable people, almost, on Earth.

It's a disgrace.  But we say it anyway. And here's the good news, the people get it. So, they have a brand new President in Ukraine, good guy by the way. And I call a brand new President, a man, I have no idea who he is. And I'm on a phone, right, and I know many people are on the phone because when you call the leaders of a country, many people listen.

And I'm on the phone, and they want me to say to this brand new President, he just got there, call to congratulate him. Please, could you help me, please? I don't know who he is. I didn't know his name until I looked down the card, I see, and he's a nice guy. And hopefully, he's going to root out corruption because Ukraine has tremendous corruption problems.

And hopefully, -- and one of the reasons I held up money, very important, corruption. But the other reason, why isn't Germany and France and U.K., and all of these European nations that are right there, why aren't they doing things that they're supposed to do? Why is it always the United States? So, I made this call, had this wonderful call, and the transcript proves it was, as I said, perfect.

It was perfect. It wasn't like, almost, it was perfect. It was totally appropriate. I made it at the behest of people to say, could you call and say hello. Now, I'm an honest person anyway, but do you think when I'm making a call to a newly elected President of a country that I would say something improper?

When I know there are so many people listening on the line, and many people. All of these people, you had the Secretary of State Pompeo, a great guy. He's listening. You had transcribers, fortunately. You had policy experts, junior age, low-level staffers, probably . Whoever wants to listen, they listen, and they have me making some kind of a deal with all these people.

And remember, the new President of Ukraine is speaking to the United States of America. The President, I guarantee he's got a lot of people listening too. These people are sick. So, corrupt politician, shifty Adam Schiff, actually stood before Congress and stood before the American people, and made up a conversation that he said I had with the Ukrainian President, unfortunately.

Now, think of it. And many people saw that and it was a terrible -- he said terrible things. The President of Ukraine said it was a very good conversation. There was no pressure, his foreign minister said the same thing, no pressure. They must think we're nuts, to be honest. It's all a phony deal.

This whole impeachment scam to try to undermine the 2020 election and to delegitimatize one of the greatest elections. Maybe the greatest -- I mean, let's give George Washington credit, but everybody expected he was going to win, that we've ever had. So, my phone call, which was totally perfect and appropriate, and if you want to read the transcript, you see how perfect it was, but they don't quit.

But what you should do is take a look at the behavior of sleepy Joe. So, I quote, I said -- let me act like him. I've got to speak really slow, though, and I said you're not getting a billion. I looked at them and I said, I'm leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor isn't fired, you're, not getting the money, you understand?

You're not getting the money. Then, he goes at the end, I didn't know he had this kind of energy. He goes, well, son of a bitch, he got fired. You know in a certain way, I was impressed because I mean, I didn't think he had the energy, the brainpower. It's turned out he doesn't. By the way, he's dropping like a rock.

You know, when you're at 1% there's always a reason. He should be there fairly, sir. As you know, the Ukrainian prosecutor that Biden got fired after threatening to withhold -- I think it was $1 billion or something -- and it was the prosecutor investigating his son's company that was paying Hunter Biden, a guy that just got thrown out of the Navy.

He was paying them millions of dollars, even though, working for an energy company, he had no experience with energy. He knew less about it than this young -- how old are you? Six, this young beautiful person in front of me. Six and this young 6-year old is smarter.

So, I think I'd basically go with her. So, what is it all about? It's called a payoff. But you know what? The fake news they apologized. I watched this horrible guy who gets lousy ratings, Anderson Cooper  Well, the hatred. I mean between him and Fredo, you get Fredo. That's Cuomo -- Fredo.

I call him Fredo like from the movie. Now, I watched Anderson Cooper and I watched him apologize for even asking the question to Biden. The good news is Biden didn't know too much about what the hell he was talking about. Remember Biden said I don't know these people. I don't know him. I don't know him. He never spoke to his son about getting millions of dollars.

No, he never spoke to him. He didn't happen to speak to him. Think of this. We're dealing with life, right? He never spoke to him. Unfortunately, the next day, you know in the world of the Internet, in the world of smart people. That's why I like Beto, he wasn't smart, couldn't handle it. I told my wife, I said see, it's not so easy.

I told our great First Lady tonight, who people love, they love her. When Beto quit like -- he quit like a dog. When he quit, I said see, people think this is easy. This isn't easy. But -- you know, it worked out that way. But Biden said I never met the people, never met the gentleman. Unfortunately, in about 10 seconds, a picture came out where they're playing golf together, but he never met him.

So now, you'll ask him he said, no, we played a round of golf. We were together for three hours. I never mentioned the fact that they're paying my son millions, no, no, no, but the press protects them. Watch this crazy Anderson Cooper, third rate, lousy ratings, third-rate person. But listen, CNN, the worst.

I mean the worst, the worst.  Oh, their light just went off, see? What -- the light was on, they just -- they don't like it. You know it's tough. Your fake CNN --  No, it's tough. I tried not to do that because I see their light on. You know, when that light goes on that means you're live.

No, that means you're live, and every time -- it's tough. Look, in all fairness, they're putting it on, it's a broadcast, very few people are -- well, they might be watching us, I guess they do watch us. But here's the thing, and then, you have the guy up there saying that they're fake. That they're no good, that they're liars and cheaters, that they're phonies.

It's hard to be broadcasting that when you're talking about the network that has you on, right? So, we understand. The lights off. And then remember this, Anderson Cooper, what a beauty. He used to interview me. He was so nice. Prior to running for politics, he was so nice to me. It was like they were love fests, but I don't want anything to do with him.

They were love fests, so what a thought. He's weak. He's a weak person but they're all weak. But let me just -- let me just tell you something. We need honesty with our media. We need honesty. Because the New York Times, The Washington Post, and by the way, I don't know you probably read it -- we throw him out of the White House, we don't show him anymore.

If somebody wants to go and buy, we throw him out. And they came into my office, and then, I get -- I got to get back to this guy. Where's Hunter? Where's Hunter? You know we had a T-shirt made where's Hunter? Where's Hunter? Poor Hunter. He then came out, he did the morning show. That was the last we've seen of Hunter.

That wasn't good. The morning of his father's very bad debate, but it's where is Hunter? But before I say the final thing on Hunter, and then, we put him to rest for a while. We got rid of the Washington Post and the failing New York Times. We got rid of them, right? We don't have them in the White House.

Now, you people can go out and buy it but we don't. We just have them stacked up -- and I go in and I'd see a meeting with my people, and they're dealing with China, South Korea or somebody, and I'd go in and go into these offices, and see like 10 or 15 of them packed up all over the place. The Washington Post, the New York Times, I keep trying to figure out who's worse, and you know, one day it's the Times and it's the Post.

It's like they top each other. They're so bad. It's so phony. It's so -- in my opinion, it's virtually corrupt. I've never seen -- you never have a good story. I mean, even with -- when we got Al Baghdadi, the Washington Post had a story that he was like a great religious cleric. Where did that come from?

The other thing, if Obama would have done it because look, this guy built ISIS, the caliphate. It was the size physically of Ohio, the state of Ohio, the great state of Ohio. That's a big lot of land, 7 million people and they were the ones, the orange jumpsuits. I called a lot of the parents after we did this and I talked to them and they were, how can you be happy?

But they were so thrilled that we got this animal. They were so thrilled, but you know what, and you know what, we don't do it -- we do it because it's right. That story was a massive story. That was the biggest, maybe the biggest, one of the biggest ever, bigger than anything. That story disappeared so fast, gone, and that's OK. I didn't do it for the story.

I did it because it's the right thing to do, but if that were, if I were a Democrat, if I were a Democrat they'd be talking about that story for weeks. With me, they don't even want to -- you know, they actually played it down, and actually -- and I'm happy about this, Conan the dog, got more publicity than me, and I'm very happy about that.

I'm very -- Conan's incredible and Conan's coming to the White House in a few weeks. But it is -- you know -- did you ever see a story disappear so fast? I mean here -- if -- if Obama had that story, that thing would be going on for another seven months. They'd be talking about his bravery, oh, he's so brave, but again, 142 judges he gave us, remember that.

How can you be a great -- you know, they always say the most important thing a President can do is federal judges. We got two Supreme Courts, great works, great job, Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, great judges. By the way, did you ever see any human being treated worse than now Justice Kavanaugh? Did anybody ever?

Was anybody -- was any human being by these people, these horrible, horrible people that we have to deal with? Anyway, just to finish. So, Hunter then goes to China and I'm dealing with China right now. They don't like me too much. They dream about the day when somebody else -- and would they like to have -- how about this.

You give this son, who has zero experience with investing, you give him $1.5 billion to invest, meaning he makes millions and millions of dollars, and the biggest guys on Wall Street can't get it. He walks out with $1.5 billion, and then there are other places also, I understand. Folks, it's disgraceful that the press doesn't cover it for what it is. It's a payoff.

It's a payoff. And how would you like to have sleepy Joe with the son getting all of this money from China to become President, and take over the China deal? I -- they are not like me. They had the worst year that they've had in 57 years. Their supply chain is broken up like scrambled eggs, and they want to make a deal because those tariffs have given us millions of dollars and billions now, billions and billions of dollars.

We're talking billions and billions of dollars. And you know what we're doing with some of it? Just a small portion but 100% they're taken care of. Our farmers got $16 billion last year and $12 billion a year before because they targeted our farmers. Because they know the farmers love Trump and Trump loves the farmers.

So, they targeted them and they brought the $16 billion down to practically nothing and they thought our farmers would say, oh, we don't like Trump. They did just the opposite. They said we know he's doing the right thing because we've been ripped off for so many years. But I said to them, I said to Secretary of Agriculture, Sonny Perdue, a great guy, I said Sonny, how much did they spend buying our corn and soybeans and all of our agricultural product?

He said sir, $16 billion. I said good I'll make it up and we're going to have a lot leftover. So, we will have pretty soon, over $100 billion in money paid into the United States Treasury by a country that never gave us $0.10, they only took, one they only took. So, when I said to the farmers we're going to send you $16 billion that's already been sent that has been split in the $12 billion the year before.

I mean think of that, $28 billion, I said compliments of China, and we had a lot leftover. Not bad, right? Not bad. Do you think Obama would do that? I don't think so. Do you think Hillary would do that? I don't think so. Do you think sleepy Joe would do that? I don't think so. He wouldn't know what you're talking about.

On Tuesday, the proud people of Mississippi will send Democrats a clear message. It's very important, for this reason, as well as, the fact that you have a great gentleman in your midst. But you have to reject their extremism and their socialism and their corruption. They're corrupt -- Adam Schiff is a corrupt politician.

You know, when he made that phony speech where he made up a really horrible speech and said that I said it. I said, oh, I'm going to sue him. They said sir, I'm sorry, you can't. He's got total immunity because he made it in Congress. Can you believe this? But you know, here's the good news. At least we have a forum, we have a place we can talk so everyone knows what's going on. A bunch of phony people.

But this is why we have to send a signal, and why you have to make Tate Reeves your great new republic -- right? Republican Governor, right? Tate, he's a great guy too. And all I know is he's loved and respected by your current Governor because Phil is some piece of work. You know Phil is so confident. I wanted Phil to run for a certain office then I wanted him to do something -- I've tried to get him, but you know, some guys are confident.

Phil said, no, sir, I've been doing this all my life. I love the people. He built the most beautiful African-American museum, Phil. He's the greatest. But he built the most beautiful-- but he's got confidence. And he said, no, sir, I've been doing it. I don't really want to do that. In other words, he said that's enough.

Most people are so insecure, they keep going and going and going. It's not good. I like Phil's attitude, but Phil is great, but I'm going to introduce Phil in a second. But Tate Reeves who Phil endorses and views as a champion for your state, and really a champion for Mississippi values. And Tate helped cut your taxes over 50 times, including the largest tax cut in Mississippi history.

Tate is pro-worker, he's pro-jobs, he's pro-family, he's pro-life. Tate is a true leader in the fight to protect the unborn, which the other side is not. Tate Reeves will support our police, oppose sanctuaries -- oh, we love our police, right? I love -- we love our police. He'll oppose sanctuary cities, which is just terrible, they're terrible, and Tate will always defend your Second Amendment.

So, Tate's running against a Liberal Democrat named Jim Hood.  Now what I know about Jim Hood is he fought very hard to elect crooked Hillary Clinton and Barack-Hussein-Obama. Isn't that nice?  He wanted Obama to win so badly, and then, he wanted Hillary to win, and that's not the kind of guy we need here, not in Mississippi.

He's supported by extreme lefties, like Stacey Abrams, who by the way, went down to defeat in front of a terrific gentleman from the great state of Georgia, Brian Kemp. And they came in with -- oh, they brought them all. They had President Obama, they had Michelle Obama, they had Oprah Winfrey, they came in, and all he had was Donald Trump, and we won.

We won. Fairly easily. But Stacey Abrams wants to give illegal aliens the right to vote. Do you believe this?  I mean, some of these people, they want to give them education, they want to give them this, they want to give them free healthcare. They want to give these people that come into our country illegally, more advantages than our own citizens have, more advantages than our own military has.

Jim Hood wants to raise your taxes. He supports taxpayer funding for abortion providers.  He supports illegal immigration and all benefits, and he opposed our travel ban, which is so important that we won in the United States Supreme Court to keep terrorists the hell out of our country.

And Jim Hood went to the United Nations and opposed your right to self-defense. If you don't want a far-left Democrat running Mississippi -- wait a minute. How's this guy, you know, I can't believe this is a competitive race. It's like embarrassing. I'm talking to Mississippi you know. I'm talking to Mississippi.

I can't believe it. I don't think that he's going to be the right guy. I think the guy that you want is Tate Reeves. He's going to be fantastic. He will be a great, great Governor. Tate, come on up, Tate.

Thank you, Tate. Tuesday, go out and vote for Tate. He'll never let you down and don't kid yourself, your Second Amendment is under attack, not with him. It's under attack. So, we're also joined tonight by a man who is truly -- and I sort of said it a lot, but he's been a great Governor and he loves your state.

He loves the people of this great state. Governor Phil Bryant. Where's Phil? Come up, Phil. Come on. Oh, he's central casting, look at him. Come here, Phil.

Thank you, Phil. Thank you. Thank you, my Phil. What a job, what a great job. You have to continue that whole thing going forward. So, another man is a warrior. He's a friend of mine. Whenever there's a problem he's there, he's always there, he'll be right at the front. He is tough, he's smart, he's brilliant actually -- and he loves this state and he loves you, people.

Senator Roger Wicker. Roger. Thanks, Roger. Thank you, Roger. And somebody I'll call her up because believe it or not she's running with me. She just ran. I said Senator you just ran, you just won. She said no, I have to do it again. She's running in 2020. I thought she'd have like six years. I said Cindy, it's only like a year.

Cindy Hyde-Smith, she's incredible, she's tough and smart, and strong, and she's with us all the way, Cindy Hyde-Smith.

Great job, fantastic woman, so also with us, two terrific friends of mine, that like Roger and like Cindy Hyde-Smith and like all of them, and Tate. He's going to be right there. He'll be right up there with us all fighting together. Two incredible people, Trent Kelly, Michael Guest. Incredible people. And your next Lieutenant Governor, Delbert Hosemann.

Your next Attorney General, Lynn Fitch. Your next Secretary of State, Michael Watson. Great people. Your next State Treasurer, David McRae; State Auditor, Shad White; Agriculture Commissioner, Andy Gibson; Insurance Commissioner, Mike Chaney; and former Governor, a man that nobody's ever heard of in this room, I'm sure.

But the truth is he's a legend in politics and a great guy. He's a great guy, Haley Barbour. Thank you, Haley. Great guy. So with the help of everyone here, we're the hottest economy in the world. We've created over 6.7 million new jobs since the election. If I would have said during the campaign that I would create 6.7 million new jobs since the election, these people would have gone crazy.

They would have said horrible things. They would have said it's impossible. Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in over 51 years, soon to be historic. African-American unemployment just dropped to the lowest rate ever recorded historic. Really an important to me, the African-American youth unemployment rate is the lowest ever recorded in the history of our country.

We lifted 55,000 Mississippi residents out of poverty, 55,000. Hourly earnings are up 9% in Mississippi since the election. Under the previous two administrations, we lost 60,000 factories in our country. Under my administration, we've already added nearly 10,000 new factories and many more are coming in as we speak.

To get relief to working families, we passed massive tax cuts on average, $2000 to $2500 per family, bringing almost $1 trillion back home to our shores. What's happening, you couldn't get the money, the big companies, they couldn't get their money back, both bureaucratically and from a tax standpoint. They brought back almost $1 trillion now because of us, all put to work.

We slashed the largest number in history of job-killing regulations, and we ended the war on American energy. We are now the number one producer of energy by far, anywhere in the world. For decades, you saw corrupt politicians take money from lobbyists to impose catastrophic trade deals. Mississippi lost 40% of all manufacturing jobs after the twin disasters of NAFTA and China's entrance into the World Trade Organization, two of the worst deals ever made by our country, 100,000 Mississippi jobs were wiped away just like that.

And that's awful and a big price to pay for Washington's disloyalty to the American worker. That's what it was. It was disloyalty, stupidity, corruption, lots of reasons. But now, you finally have a President who is loyal to you, and I am. I'm a fighter for your jobs, for your wages, your factories, your families, and your dignity.

We're stopping China from ripping us off. We're stopping all of these other countries from taking advantage of the United States, where we lose our money, we lose our wealth, we lose our jobs, we close our factories. That's not happening anymore, it's reversed. We were the sucker country for years and years, but we are not the sucker country anymore and they all know it. We're replacing NAFTA and that was a disaster, NAFTA.

With the brand new U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement of Nancy Pelosi will ever put it up to a vote, which is questionable. Nervous Nancy, she doesn't want to give the people of our country a victory. She's very busy doing other things, having fun. The USMCA will be a massive victory for Mississippi's farmers, and also includes, powerful protections for Mississippi auto workers, manufacturers, and everybody else.

A great agreement, about time we got rid of NAFTA. The do-nothing Democrats need to stop their madness and pass the USMCA right now. The last administration's horrendous Trans-Pacific Partnership would have destroyed the U.S auto industry, but I proudly -- first thing, withdrew from that job-killing calamity.

Under our policies, Toyota has just announced a $170 million investment in Mississippi and 400 new jobs at its facility. Did you ever hear of this place? Blue Springs, Blue Springs. Before my election, our leaders used the great American middle class as a piggy bank to fund their delusional global projects all over the world.

We take care of other people, we take care of other countries, but we don't take care of our own. They knowingly decimated American manufacturing to promote economic growth in foreign countries. They deployed our military to protect, think of this, immensely wealthy nations subsidizing their welfare states with your money.

I ask those wealthy nations now -- I respectfully, the other day said to the King of Saudi Arabia, King, we're going to help you, but you've got to pay. And he was great. No, he was great. He was great, he said, but nobody has ever asked before. I said, but I'm asking and billions of dollars will come in, and we're protecting a great ally.

We have a -- we have a country that spends billions and billions of dollars in our country, buying military and other things. But we said, you're very wealthy you have to pay, and they're going to pay. And that's true with many countries, by the way, that's true with many countries. They never respected us. They could never believe it. I said to one country, I have great respect for the Prime Minister of Japan.

I said to Prime Minister, I said how did you get away with this for so long? And he looked at me and he couldn't really answer it because how the hell did this happen? We're protecting, like 94 countries, ask China. How many countries are you protecting, President Xi? And they look at me like, what a stupid question.

We protect one, China. If you ask President Putin, how many countries are you protecting, President Putin? And he looks and he goes, Russia. You ask other countries, we're protecting at least 94, that's so many they don't even -- they can't even tell me. I've been trying to get an answer for months. So many they can't even tell -- it's crazy, but it's all beautiful the way it's happening, a lot of good things are happening.

But these same politicians poured precious American blood and treasure into the sands of the Middle East while allowing our cities to fall into disrepair and decay. Our failed ruling class believed it was their right to rule over you to take your money to take your jobs, to redistribute your wealth, all over the globe, wherever they wanted it. But I don't like that.

I don't like it. The great sellout out has ended and it ended the day I took the oath of office. That was quite a . After years of building up foreign nations, we are finally building up our nation. We are finally putting America first. Our policy of never-ending war, regime change, and nation-building is being replaced by the clear-eyed pursuit of American interests.

It is the job of our military to protect our security, not to be the policeman of the world. Proving the wisdom of this approach, we recently secured a permanent ceasefire in Northern Syria without spilling one drop of American blood, not one drop. Actually, I have to be honest, one soldier stepped on a nail.

It's true. I said don't tell the press that because They'll say -- but one soldier stepped on a nail. I said how bad was it? It's OK. I said don't mention it, please. They always like to mention exactly what happened. You could take it a little bit low key, stepped on a nail. [Audience member calls out "Go, Donald.

Audience BoosNot not a drop of blood. And we don't have to defend the borders between Turkey and Syria. They've been fighting for a thousand years, but what we do is we did keep the oil if you don't mind. We kept the oil. We kept the oil. And we'll distribute that oil, we'll help out the Kurds, and we'll help out other people, we'll also help out ourselves if that's OK. Past leaders, foolish military adventures turned faraway nations into very, very dangerous war zones.

Then, they demanded that American citizens accept unlimited migration from those terror-afflicted nations and regions. I don't think so. I don't think so. We did not fight them over there only to invite them over here. We don't want to do that. To protect our communities, my administration restricted migration from terror-prone nations and implemented the toughest ever vetting procedures, toughest ever that we've ever had.

No issue has ever been so horribly discarded by a party, as that issue by the Democrats. They want open borders which means crime. They want sanctuary cities which means crime and drugs and death. After bleeding the middle-class dry, Democrats threw open our borders to the world, flooding our communities with poisonous drugs, and criminal cartels.

Republicans believe in strong borders and safe communities. We are now building a wall.  We're building it. We're building it. And you think that was easy? The Democrats, they didn't want that wall. I got money for everything but when it came to the wall, not ten cents, not ten cents, but we gave the military a lot of money and we took it from the military, and we took it from here, and we took it from there, and we had to go to court.

And all of a sudden, we start winning cases. We're winning cases now, winning a lot of cases. But the wall is going up rapidly. It's going up rapidly, and this is a very serious wall. This is the exact -- everything they wanted. They went to the Border Patrol, incredible people, and ICE, incredible people, tough people, they love our country.

And I said give me the specifications for the wall. They said, well, sir, we'd like steel but we'd also like concrete and would also like rebar -- I said what do you want? Which one? So, I did all three because it's a different form of cutting. You can get through steel, but you can't through the concrete, and then, you can't through the hardened rebar.

We got it all and we also need to see through, sir. You've got to see who's on the other side. That makes sense, right? It's not just concrete. It's more expensive what we're doing, but we're giving and we're building -- we should have anywhere from 400 to almost 500 miles of wall built by the end of next year.

It's going in all the right areas, in all the right areas. That was a tough one, and the Army Corps of Engineers is building their hearts out. They're great. They're great people. We believe in keeping terrorists and criminals and drug dealers the hell out of our country. And thanks to our tireless efforts on the Southern border, tough place.

Illegal crossings have dropped 60% since May and we are faster than ever securing the Southern border, and soon, it will be when the wall is completed, secure, like it's never been before. And I want to thank the country of Mexico. They right now have 27,000 soldiers on our borders; 27,000; do you know that is? And they are keeping people out -- and I want to thank the President of Mexico.

He's an excellent person, great man, and we appreciate it, and the reason is that our Democrats won't even approve things called loopholes. They're loopholes. That's a horrible name, right? That means it's a loophole. That means you can come in illegally and lots of things, catch and release. You catch him then you got to release them.

By law, you've got to release them. They'll arrest the Border Patrol agent if they -- it's crazy, but we could end this in 15 minutes. But they don't want to do it. They don't want to do it. Their obstructionists, they're colluders, and we can't let it happen. That's why you have to go with Tate Reeves. You know, Tate's going to send -- Tate's going to send a big signal, by the way.

It's great for you. He's going to be a great Governor. It also sends a big signal to these radical left crazy Democrats. It's very important that Tate wins, very important. We're also fighting deadly sanctuary cities with the help of states like Mississippi, which has banned sanctuary cities because Phil Bryant said we're not going to have them and Roger Wicker said we're not going to have them, and Cindy said we're not going to have them.

Democrat sanctuary cities forced the release of dangerous criminal aliens onto our streets. If you want a Governor who will stand proudly with the heroes of ICE, and they are heroes, I wouldn't want their job. MS-13, they walk right into those nest, they call them a nest. And they start swinging -- you've never seen anything like it. I'll say, you know what, better you than me. Let's see, who would do good?

He'd do good, that guy, that guy would do that. Mostly you wouldn't do good. No, I mean, these guys are tough guys and they love our country. Who would do it? They're moving thousands of people from MS-13. These gangs are the worst people. These people -- these are not human beings. You know, I said that once before, and this crazy Nancy Pelosi said how dare you say, they're not human.

Have you ever see these people? And they slice people up with a knife because it's more painful than using a gun. And then, I have to defend myself when I say they're animals. But you know what, I never changed. I didn't say, oh, I'd like to apologize. I'd like to apologize crazy Nancy. And you got to look at her district in San Francisco.

She's spending all her time on this crap, all this impeachment stuff. Take a look at what's happening to the great city, once, of San Francisco. It's thousands and thousands of tents and drugs and needles, and everything you can imagine floating in the streets in the best neighborhoods. Nancy Pelosi, go home and fix your district, Nancy.

Go home and fix your district. Go home and fix your district. If you want a Governor who will stand proudly with the heroes of ICE and Border Patrol, vote for Tate Reeves, Tuesday, got to get out. You've got to get out. You've got to send the signal. Let it be a big victory too. The Democrat Party has never been more extreme, you know that than it is today.

The Democrats' healthcare agenda would obliterate Medicare. I will always protect Medicare for our seniors, and we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions, always. We will always take care of them. Virtually every Democrat, also now supports, late-term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother's womb, right up until the moment of birth.

Well, the Governor of Virginia executed a baby, remember that whole thing? After birth, after birth, some people never heard of it. He said the baby is born, and then, he starts talking to the mother. Nobody ever heard that. That is why I've asked Congress to prohibit extreme late-term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God.

Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion, socialism, and blatant corruption. The Republican Party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream. Nobody has done more for the African-American community than the Republican Party, and we're also the Party of Abraham Lincoln.

We can't forget that, people forget. Abraham Lincoln, honest Abe. To lift up distressed communities, we created opportunity zones. So incredible, so successful, including 100 new opportunity zones right now in Mississippi, where money is now flowing in to build and to fix, and Tim Scott. I give him so much credit from the great state of South Carolina.

We passed VA choice and VA accountability on behalf of our great veterans. People said it couldn't be done, VA choice. Our veterans were waiting in line for days and weeks sometimes. Now, they can go out choice, they can go out, get a doctor, we pay the bill, and they don't have to wait six weeks, four weeks, two weeks.

We have people waiting in line, they weren't very sick, by the time they saw the doctor, they were terminally ill. Now, they go on and they go and they go outside and they find a doctor and we take care of our great veterans. The great rebuilding of the American Armed Forces has included massive investments in the military and facilities in Biloxi and Gulfport and Jackson and Starkville and Roger has been fantastic and Cindy Hyde-Smith has been fantastic.

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. To protect America's security, I withdrew the United States from the horrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal. It's not the same country anymore. Nothing's easy but it's not the same, and I recognize Israel's true capital and open the American embassy in Jerusalem. For years you watched as your politicians apologize for America.

Now, you have a President who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the people of Mississippi. The next step to victory begins on Tuesday, right here in your great state. With your support, we will show the corrupt Democrats that the American people are not ever going to back down from, perhaps the greatest victory in political history, and you know today with the new stock market at an all-time high.

It's -- I will tell you something if we didn't win this election, that stock market would be in one half. It was heading in the wrong direction and it was going to fail. And if they ever did anything bad, if they ever do anything bad to us, if they ever succeed in their wildest dream, which will never let them happen.

That stock market will crash like you've never seen a crash before, and you will not be happy with your 401(k)s like you're happy right now, because they don't know what they're doing. They don't know what they're doing. And I'd like to speak well, but the leadership they have no clue. They're just very vicious people, actually, they're sort of mentally violent people, but we've got it under control.

It always helps when you didn't do anything wrong. I always say, how do you impeach a President who didn't do anything wrong? So, we're going to send a signal by sending a terrific new Republican Governor to Jackson. On Tuesday, you're going to get out and you're going to vote and you're going to give up whatever you have to give up. You're going to leave work maybe a little earlier or maybe get there a little late.

Tell your boss I said it was OK. I will give you a pardon if I have to. I'll give you one hour pardon. But with your help, we will lift millions more of our great citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. Together, we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration, and you have great Congressmen here.

And I'll tell you what, I appreciate it. You're warriors, you're warriors, you are warriors. What was it 196 for and nothing against, right? That doesn't happen with Republicans. It doesn't happen. I always complain. I would say the Democrats are lousy politicians. They have lousy policies, open borders, sanctuary cities, but they have one thing, they stick together and they're vicious.

The Republicans have great policy, in many ways, they're better politicians but they're not as vicious. Thank you, darling. I appreciate it. They're not as vicious but they have a tendency to split apart. The Democrats don't seem to have any Mitt Romney's, we do, we do. I don't know. Maybe he'll get better, maybe he'll get better.

We'll see. We'll see what happens. Maybe I'll get better. Just let it be fair, but they don't have that. We will enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with those beautiful, beautiful words made in the USA, made in America. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine.

Finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic in America. Can you believe that? Within 10 years it will be over. When they told me that I said that's incredible. We're going to end the AIDS epidemic within 10 years. It's funded. Nobody else thought we could do that but we're doing it. We'll have it ended in America in 10 years, the AIDS epidemic, who would've thought.

We will defend privacy, free speech, free assembly, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America. We support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement.

We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. And we live by the words of our national motto and we always will, you'll never see it disappear, In God we Trust.

We stand on the shoulders of American patriots who cross the oceans, settle the continent, tame the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, revolutionized industry, pioneered technology, won two World Wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America the single-greatest nation in the history of the world, and today, it's greater than ever before.

Proud citizens, like you, helped build this country, and together, we are taking back our country. That's what we're doing, that's what happened in 2016. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning, we get so tired of winning.

I don't know Mississippi. You know you're winning. You had the best year you've ever had. You know you have the best Mississippi, the best year you've ever had in the history of our country. Mississippi, your statistic, and Mississippi, aren't you getting tired of winning?  I guess not.

So, Phil doesn't come to me and say, sir, please, we're winning too much. The people of Mississippi can't take it anymore. I don't think you'll ever have to make that trip. I don't think he's ever going to have to, and I don't think Tate will ever have to make that trip. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God.

America is thriving like never before, and ladies and gentlemen of Mississippi, the best is yet to come. Because together, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will Make America Great Again. Thank you, Mississippi. Thank you.
