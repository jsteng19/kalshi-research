it is a distinct honor and a great privilege to present to you the next

president of the United States Donald Trump

back here was that a great introduction I mean an offer and he's known me for a

long time i used to have to get those zoning approvals from in New York they

were tough he is a great guy what a great introduction

it's always nice thank you you know we had one day to set this up look at this

place

we had one day one day we're gonna do great in North Carolina we just left

we just left you know where we were and the crowds were getting here amazing

know the enthusiasm is so incredible

but you know what is nice when you have people like Rudy that really know you

and they speak from the heart as opposed to every once in awhile and they're very

nice to get up and they have endorsed you were there with you but they don't

know you fact you've only known her for about 12 minutes right and they say

Donald Trump button this and that and doesn't mean the same I've known ready

for I guess close to 30 years I hate to admit that long because it's like a long

time but I've known for a long time and he was a great mayor did a great job and

everything he's ever done and a special guy and I hope that if I win we're going

to be taking him and chris Christie and general Flynn migrate sheriff out there

we have a so many different so many different people that are on this

campaign we have we're loaded up with great sheriffs and great people you know

we have just amazing people we're gonna be bringing fantastic people on board

and I've gotten to know so many people doing this and one but somebody said

before you know you should mention some of the people ben Carson such an

incredible guy

great

he's a great person great human being and some of the people that in all

fairness you know we had 17 people some of the people i ran against they got to

know him and they're good i didn't treat him very nicely but that's ok you know

that's all but we're gonna bring a lot of the people that you know a lot of

people that you respect and we're going to do it based on talent based on all of

the things that we need for the different positions we have such talent

in this country we're not using it

we're just not using it such incredible talent and speaking of talent

so what's with this voter ID in north carolina right

what's with this

you know I keep talking about rigged system i watch Bernie Sanders work work

work for old burning he's working working working and i said i think the

system's rigged you know the super-delegates what happened to Bernie

where is you what happened but we're gonna get a lot of Bernie voters I think

we really well because I talk about trade and I've been talking about it for

years many years before i was doing this have been doing this for like what 15

months now

before long before I was doing this I was talking about trade and what a

disgusting situation it is for our country you know that two days ago I met

a supporter and he's in the tile business great guy but he said his

business is being decimated by foreign countries with a make tile and the

towels not nearly as good and he can't send his tile to those countries because

there's a 27-percent tax and it's very tough but they can send their stuff in

here and there stuff by the way is not as good as what this man makes and you

know the trade thing it's all like we talked about free trade and I want trade

and i'm not in isolation is by the way i want free trade but i wanted to be great

trade for our country

it's got to be a two-way street it's got to be a to waste and it will be a

two-way street again it will be a two-way street but he was telling me how

impossible it was for him in this case it was China but it's really almost

everybody how impossible it was for him to do business in China and not for long

and will do business in China we're going to do business in China but we're

going to do it on an equal footing right now they can dump their product and you

know what i'm talking about the steel they dump and I think they dumped it to

put our steel companies out of business so that we have to go to China to buy

the stuff and you know what

not gonna happen anymore folks it's not going to happen anyway

and if you think Hillary Clinton knows anything about it number one I know

about it but even if she did it wouldn't matter because she's controlled by her

donors and her special interests

totally controlled by her donors and special interest so if she knew it

wouldn't make any difference wouldn't make any difference whatsoever so we're

going to bring back our trade you know somebody said to me what's the most

important well there's so many things we got a repeal Obamacare replace it we

gotta have strong borders at me there's so many things you can go on and on and

on he could stand here for three days we can tell you what's wrong and so many of

these things are so easy to fix one of the things that amazes me when I talk

about trade I want to trade i think it's good

the concept of trip it's got to be fair but here's the thing i say i'm going to

renegotiate NAFTA which is a disaster right by the way in North Carolina and

virtually every other place in all fairness but they have ripped businesses

from your guts

they've taken businesses out of this state out of Ohio out of michigan

michigan has just been decimated by after the auto plans you've got to see

what they're building in Mexico they are building some of the greatest biggest

most modern plants in the world for cars for computers for everything and you

know what folks I think that's fine but we're not going to help them

we're going to fight for ourselves we're gonna have a policy very simple America

first remember that America

so we have essentially two people running and Hillary made it through a

small field I made it through a large field and she got through I got through

we're stuck with each other just fine and I'll tell you what if you knew where

she stood on the 2nd amendment on the raising which you basically wants to

take your safety way she wants to take your guns away and by the way if she

appoints Supreme Court justices meeting if she gets the option to a point

meaning a very sad day in this country because if she became president should

do a terrible job this would be four more years of obama and we don't want

four more years of Obama we don't want Isis we don't want regulations we don't

want high taxes all of these things would would be an extension this would

be an extension a four-year extension of obama and i think in many ways it maybe

end up being worse so if she gets to a point Supreme Court justices you know

the next president will appoint probably three but it could even be four or five

that's the way the cards for will be a record setting number possibly and we

had judge Kelly as an example that was supposed to be Justice Scalia was

supposed to be there for a lot longer and that he was taken from us and he was

a great guy and we are going to appoint justices you know I named 11 people that

are highly highly vented highly vented heritage and different people and gone

through different people that I respect conservative people smart people and

very importantly and the wheel standard if we could find as close to Justice

Scalia because he was a terrific United States

Supreme Court change now if on the other hand if Hillary points if Hillary points

justices of the Supreme Court you can have a lot of problems folks you can

have a lot of problems because you know if they're on the court for 20 or 25

years and you have four of them let's say or three of them or five of them

I mean we've gone for like what 75 years meaning we're gone as a country because

we will be a large scale version of Venezuela that's what's gonna happen and

you see what's happening in vent as well so we can't let it happen

we can't let it happen now just a couple of things and I wrote these down a week

ago and I've said it and I mean it but I said unstable Hillary Clinton lacks the

judgment remember when Bernie Sanders talked about judgment he said she has

bad judgment

now what he said it nobody picked it up and when I say it nobody picks it up

either because you can't say a bad because the press will never pick up

anything that's correct or accurate or bad about it now it's such it is such a

double standard but Bernie Sanders said that Hillary Clinton had bad judgment

and he said it many times and he said it over and over and then I think he was

really asked not to say that anymore and he stopped because they were perhaps

more civil that we were in our site we would never stop but she's bad judgment

her temperament a word she uses all the time is terrible

it's a loser's temperament she's got the temperament of a loser i have the

temperament of a winner and we have to win again

we have to win

she said about me not so long ago my tone she said I don't like two tone t.o

n.e I don't like the tone of Donald Trump now in the Middle East they're

chopping off heads they're drowning people in steel cages they're burying

people in the sand and she doesn't like my tone I think it's time maybe for a

little tougher tone folks you know no time for

so the bad judgment alone you can't pick a hill look whether you look at Libya

you look at Syria you take a look at the migration take a look at this

she wants to put and I said five hundred percent and the press that I was wrong

it wasn't the right number five hundred percent more people coming in from Syria

we don't know who they are where they come from

she wants and I said five hundred percent more than President Obama and

he's got a pouring in right and the press that I was wrong you know what the

real number was 550 percent i couldn't believe it i was on the low side that

was on the low side 550 percent more than we have coming in right now and you

know what this is going to be in my opinion and I've been pretty right of

these things I said don't go into Iraq was right about it i said and by the way

once we were in Iraq getting out the way Obama got out cause problems that are

going to be very hard to solve

i said 'i reparable what they have done what they have done in terms of getting

out of Iraq Isis comes about you know i said before also in North Carolina I

said that if they gave a trophy for the most valuable player you call it in

sports most pack valuable player award the winner of the trophy for Isis would

probably have to be Hillary click right Hilary clone

and now she's gonna tell you how to get rid of Isis she's gonna tell you how

cause her and Obama and I guarantee you that if Obama had the choice to do again

now you have to go and play the game but if he had the choice to do again for

Secretary of State and if he knew what took place in the Middle East and other

places i guarantee you he would never have picked Hillary Clinton he would

never picked her he would not have gone that way now you're not going to hear

that i'm sure he tells that to his wife but it's about it because he can't but

that's the way it is

Shoshi she is just a person that if she's president we're gonna have

problems like you've never had before she talks about toughness with Russia

wouldn't it be nice if we actually got along with people will not be a nice

thing

ok you know Russia is a nuclear nation has nuclear weapons you know she's tough

they talk about Crimea i answered a question perfectly they were talking

about Russian what I would do with Ukraine and Russia but you know by the

time this is now taking place

Crimea is already a part of Russia essentially right and this happened on

Obama's watch so they put out a thing about me I didn't know foreign policy i

didn't know foreign policy

why did you let Crimea go to Russia they don't want to mention this they don't

want to mention the fact that when i was asked about NATO that I said look NATO's

obsolete now i'm not an expert on NATO but I have a lot of common sense i have

great business sense i made a lot of money and I had great success

but but you know what built a great great company far greater than anybody

even understands but but you know what I said

NATO's absolutely and they all smiled and laughed Oh Donald Trump he said it's

obsolete

don't forget this was done for the Soviet Union many many many years ago

now let's say Russia tough so it's ok for Russia to right let's say it's fine

but this was done originally for the Soviet Union it morphs into Russia

that's fine but we have a new threat it's called terrorism and then not

equipped for terrorism they don't even have the right countries for terrorism

and i said this actually to Wolf Blitzer CNN but I said this and people smiled

how that that funny isn't that funny

three days later they start saying Trump is right it's really obsolete you know

you ever hear the expression you can't see the forest for the trees right right

you can't see the forest for the trees you guys good people they study need to

this so close they're so close that they can't see what's going on

so all of a sudden 34 days later somebody came out that your truck's got

a point and then a couple of months ago on the wall street journal of the front

page I read because I said terrorism it's absolutely because it's not

covering terrorism the way it should be and then all of a sudden i read a big

story from picture of the wall street journal Nate out to develop terrorism

division

and I was only mentioned like 18 of one sense that I essentially wasn't happy

they could give me a little more credit but that saturday the credit I want our

country to be great again that's what i really want that's what

but then I said a second thing with them i said a second thing thank you thank

you very much i said a second thing within I said we have too many countries

that are paying their way because i had heard it and I don't study it i mean

that NATO was aight i'll tell you what when I was asked a question about NATO I

give you my word it's not I you know I'm a business guy in in my whole life I was

never asked about NATO right but I gave a great answer and they've actually

changed NATO because of what i said ok now it's not because of what i said

because of what we said you know folks just so you know something we have a

movement going on here

this is a movement this is

this is a real great movement this is a beautiful thing to watch no matter where

we go the crowds the enthusiasm I mean this thing we started today

here I said let's stop there it's great i have a friend that lives in the area I

said alright i'll come up

I mean it's amazing and by the way I love the military is this military or

why i love the world and and we're gonna take care of the military

we're going to take care of the military you know I have to say I'm in a lot of

businesses but i'm in the real estate business primarily and i get so many

listings of military bases this one's for sale that one's and at one point few

years ago I said wow how many bases can we sell you know they're getting rid of

so many places in so many bases and you know the one thing i'm a big believer in

cutting and we can do a lot of cutting and a lot of pruning and have things be

better look at the VA as an example how badly run is the VA how badly run is the

VA and yet it's like a corrupt enterprise but how badly run is that and

that's not just a question of money

it's a question of management it's a question of style our veterans are not

being treated as well as a lot of people that come into our country illegally

yeah

on by the way they said my wife Melania might have come in illegally can you

believe that one

no no they said headlines maybe she came in illegally maybe let me tell you one

thing she has got its are documented so she's gonna have a little news

conference over the next couple weeks s good that's good i love it I love it

they said a lot of Trump may have come into our country illegally and how would

that be for Donald Trump to be tucked is the only problem she came in totally

legally i may get outside so I was like all right but you'll see it a little

well I said to her no no let it simmer for a little while let them go while let

it simmer and then let's have a little news conference and absolutely but they

have to come in and by the way we want people to come in to our country but

they have to come in Legally they have to come in

wriggle

yeah

now

Hillary Clinton I just have to go because these facts are pretty obvious

but we have to go from like one last time because we're dealing with a person

that doesn't know how to tell the truth

we're dealing with a very dishonest human being you know remember the word

you remember the word short-circuit can you imagine if i said i had a

short-circuit headlines all over the world right with hurts a little story

fact i watch that interview with chris wallace at Fox I watched it and I saw

her say lots of bad things you know I mean like lots of bad things

the lie on the lie on the lime it got to be like multiples right so many things

how did you get away with it her greatest achievement in life will be

getting away with what she got away with that's in my opinion

I see this guy Blagojevich and I know him because he was on the apprentice

right

the guy's got in jail for 14 years and he just I guess lost an appeal today or

something

he's in jail for 14 years and Hillary Clinton is allowed to delete 33,000

emails think of that think of that

what's going on what's going on

yeah

haha

Sen said anonymously folks it's a very said situation our country has been set

back the world watch that whole situation that world has been watching

and it's very very bad and I'll tell you what it's big so badly so badly of our

country because everybody knows that she should not be running for the Presidency

right now she should not be running everybody knows that go over a couple of

the go over a couple of the statements will do it quickly because you know it

looks and now they say the foundation the foundation well then I get together

of that they're not going to do anything with the foundation right now look at

the foundation give me a break

Hillary Clinton claim the reason for her illegal use of private insecure email

totally insecure was that it was more convenient to use just one device

ok fact the FBI director said Hillary use several devices and numerous mobile

devices

therefore it was a lie false statement number two I mean we go we could go fall

second number 30

hey what you love to see what some of those 33,000

when you love to say that I tell you it's very it's very very honestly it's a

very sad situation very sad situation but have you get away with it you say by

the way we won't be giving in thirty-three thousand emails but we

subpoenaed the emails i assumed they subpoenaed them right

we want the emails oh well we delete 33,000 oh well that's okay that's fine

no problem

can you imagine if somebody else do that here till tell Petraeus submitted false

statement number two in her testimony to congress Hillary Clinton said she turned

over all of her work-related emails all of the FBI director said Hillary failed

to turn over several thousand work-related emails including some

emails that were classified what's going on and what's going on

false statement number three in her testimony to congress Hillary Clinton

said there was nothing marked classified on my email either spent received app

you not that's false and that's been proven and I could go all h2 page after

page and won't ever change folks we have a person that's very dishonest we have a

person that shouldn't be able to run we have a person that how she escaped this

unbelievable situation is considered one of the great wonders of the world

I'll tell you right now said it's very said so look a few things Hillary

comparison wants to raise taxes tremendously Trump Trump that's me

Trump wants to lower them very substantially you saw that

Hillary crooked Hillary she is crooked as a three-dollar bill crooked Hillary

wants to expand regulations and by the way regulations my opinion and I go

around i'm all over the country meet unbelievable people if they had a choice

of having their taxes reduced or their regulations pretty much wiped out to a

large extent i mean we need certain regulations environmental we need and

you know we need certain but we have it so excessive you can start businesses

you can't keep is going to find out that people would rather have his reaches

substantially then have their taxes reduced and we're just about the highest

tax nation in the world that tells you what's going on

alright Hillary Clinton wants to shut down energy production she wants to fire

get rid of all the miners he doesn't want any minus any minors in here by the

way now we're going to expand energy we're going to expend all forms of

energy but we're going to expand energy right are right Hilary think of this

Hillary once our look at that she wants to . far-left judges who will destroy

back and stripped I want judges who will support and defend our Constitution

right Hilary wants to open our borders and I want to have strong borders and

we're going to have the wall and Mexico's gonna pay for the wall right

yeah

yeah

yeah

yeah

I have to say it's very interesting because a lot of the people the

politicians that idea what they come to me and they say Donald you don't really

mean bill to work you know they're not in the construction business like I am

and like some of the people they really mean it too i mean they made it they

wouldn't have any any chance of building because they wouldn't know where to

begin but they come up and they say you don't really mean you're gonna build a

wall do you you're kidding right you know you can I said not now it's easy

precast blank being boom see the ceiling that stealing is a little low compared

to this wall not a low ceiling too little out compared to our wall but

think of it so they come up to me and they really made it they're good people

they come up some are good people actually but they come see really build

a convincing me really easy goes fast

by the way over 12 version up but never see these highways where they put up the

walls along the highways it always amazed me somebody buys a house along

the highway so they know what they're buying right they do you know what I'm

about to say the money that we waste so they buy a house and it's along a

highway and highways a little noisy little everything but that's why they

brought the acid wait for a low price because they don't want to be along a

highway they don't want the the whatever it is that they don't want the noise so

they buy this house and they happen and they're fine and then they get the

government to build a wall and make the house more valuable in the government

spends a fortune in the world but take those walls and they go up like magic

now make it much much bigger

okay i don't mean a little bit bigger I mean like if you get up there man you

don't wanna you want to be very careful getting down and walls to work just ask

Israel how to walzwerk Israel they work

right right all you have to do is ask ask is real about what I ask is really

about what

so we're gonna build a wall and I also tell these folks when they come up and

they talk about it's impossible to build a wall right you know and I really made

it look at the highways they build these things all over the place I don't even

know why I don't know what they built so many of them they're putting them all

over the place I want somebody that's you know what's gonna help us

ok it's going to help us but we're going to build a wall then they come up and

they say you can't do it nicely away take a look at China they have a thing

called the Great Wall of China I don't know if anybody's ever little wall that

goes 13,000 miles right 13,000 miles the Great Wall of China 13,000 you know what

13,000 miles is i mean we're talking about a serious wall we're talking about

a wall like there is no wall

what's canada like five or six thousand right so we're talking about really much

more than twice canada along canada so here we have a situation with

politicians are telling me about the 1i refer them back 2,000 years

this wall was built 2,000 years ago this by the way if anyone has ever seen the

grip of China's a serious wall

this is not a wall built with hydraulic equipment this was built with hydraulic

muscles so it's 13,000 miles and was built 2,000 years ago so we have 2,000

miles of which we really need only 1000 because we have a lot of natural borders

right we have a lot of natural barriers and so we have thousands of US China had

13,000 we have and we can use caterpillar tractors i'm not using

komatsu by the way

or will use John Deere tractors right you like John what will use Jacobson you

know Jacobson good company i use Jacobson to i use a lot you know how

much john deere & Jacobson equipment i bought over the years and Jacobson's

here to you know that right there I have it I have a very big property right have

a very very big property in North Carolina and I have John Deere and I

have Jacobson i have all but I bought millions and millions and millions of

dollars of equipment millions of dollars worth of equipment and I try when i can

divide made in the USA i try sometimes you can't because sometimes they devalue

the dollar or the their currency so much they devalue like China is the Grand

Master of devaluation and so now other countries I'm it doesn't take so much to

figure it out what takes a lot is to get away with it because what they do is

cheating and i want to buy when we can made-in-the-usa remember the old days we

have to send we had science made in the USA made in America was like us have you

seen and what happened to it I think if i win we're gonna sort of go back to

made in the USA or made in America

it's true we don't see that anymore right you don't see that used to be a

sign of quality when you had a car when you had something made in the USA made

in America both up and you don't see him anymore

we're gonna go back is we're gonna make so many things again folks we're not

making product anymore

our plants i tell the story all the time because to me it's a great story

I have a friend who's probably in the world the biggest builder of plants he

built the plants that's what he does great guy and he does plans master plans

for cars for computers for like anything if it's a plant he builds it and I said

how are you doing he said I'm doing good business is good really has the United

States doing not so great i said well how's business good he said Donald

you've got to see what's happening in Mexico what's happening in Mexico is the

eighth wonder of the world

we're building some of the biggest most beautiful plants you've ever seen

he'd rather build them here ok he'd much rather building here but that's not the

way our government works because we allow this to happen and they're taking

our businesses from North Carolina and from all these other states Ohio big

lake michigan tremendous what they're doing they're taken all of them they're

taking tremendous auto business you look at Ford you look at these other car

companies and they're going there and we're like sort of left holding the bag

that's not going to happen anymore folks okay not gonna happen now so they say

and I've been watching I've been watching for years I've been watching

for years and I've been seeing our country our government officials who

don't know what they're doing all sorts of tax abatements and low-interest loans

and zero interest loans and they'll give us zero interest loan and somebody will

move anyway they'll say that

let's get ready they forgot to put a restrictive covenant but I've been

watching them fight moving companies for so long and all you have to do is use

the example of carrier they build air conditions they announced to

indianapolis indiana a place that I love because we had such a big victory and

Bobby Knight really helped i will tell you Lou Holtz and so many others but

Bobby Knight

was in there campaigning with me but we had a big victory we want to miss a

victory there and one of the reasons was carrier fired their employees the moving

to Mexico and here's how you stop the folks you say i'm going to charge a

35-percent tax and every air conditioner that you make and sell into the United

States and go through a very strong border by the way and here's what

happens number one of you say it soon enough

nobody leaves now let's say somebody called me ten years ago and they put me

in charge of companies not leaving the United States ok that's my official i am

secretary of companies not leaving the United States I don't think one company

would have left the United States ok i really don't i might not have been nice

who cares it's like some of the people that I have negotiated i will have we

have some of the greatest business leaders in the world that have endorsed

me and they want me to win because they know i know what i'm talking about and

we will use these people some of them are not nice people do we care we have

very nice people right now we have such nice people that they don't put America

first they put American night they don't care about America many of our political

hacks many are diplomats that have no understanding of business or anything

else so here's the story folks we are going to stop this barage of companies

leave you have people right now in this room think they have a good job and

their companies negotiating to move to Mexico or another place or their company

is being taken over by China or and then it would be closed and they'll take the

product but China's even do that they just sell things into the country and

you want to try doing business in China it's almost impossible because they make

it so difficult to get your product and i have friends and manufacturers they

cannot get their product in and if they do get into have to pay a massive tax

and your China comes in so we have a 500 billion dollar trade deficit with china

we have a tremendous trade deficit like around 60 billion with Mexico that's why

when I say Mexico will pay for the wall everyone so you have to be well the

trade deficit is massive compared to the cost of the wall and we're talking about

we lose so much money on trade with Mexico and that's not including the

drugs that poor across the border we're not including that that's a separate

category and we're going to stop that

and by the way border patrol the border patrol ages of our country 16,500 have

endorsed me they've never endorse the presidential because we're not going to

play games and sheriff joe arpaio of Arizona sheriff joe endorsement that's

pretty so we can have strong borders will have strong borders

we're gonna have great radius we're going to renegotiate after and we're

gonna make deals instead of taking our company's we're gonna make the deal

stare and if they don't think i'll tell you honestly very simple if they don't

want to renegotiate you know what's gonna happen bye-bye

we're finished we're finished that was the deal signed by bill clinton and he

never had suffered the ravages because he left that to others but I looked at

new england when I was campaigning I got to know so much about this country much

more than I ever thought I could even fathom I got to know the people of

states even upstate New York I know New York but i got to know the people

upstate New York and a different parts of Long Island that were absolutely it's

ravaged what's happened is horrible

you see factories use but beautiful and they're literally falling apart this

what app music that I what factories by the thousands and tens of thousands and

now they're all either unemployed or having jobs that aren't as good as an

example many people in this room made more money eighteen years ago

ok and they didn't work as hard as they're working out and now they have in

many cases two jobs and that's why we have the crowds and that's why we have

the movement and that's why we're going to win in November II i really believe

now for the military people in the room

we're doing great with the military i think we're going to win the military

like is anyone not gonna vote for is any military people in the room ratio who is

going to vote for Trump of the military people in the room i think it looks like

a very similar I think and you know who else likes from the police

we have so many endorsements from the police the police are not treated
