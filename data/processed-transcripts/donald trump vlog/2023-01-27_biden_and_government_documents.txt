Tiana Lowe from the Washington Examiner said it best. "It's very disturbing that this goes back to time in the Senate because unlike President Trump, Vice President Biden didn't have the right to declassify these documents. No ability whatsoever to do so. We're talking about a span of two decades minimum.

The timeline there were 68 days elapsed between Biden finding the documents and them becoming public news. They did this to avoid, not only the midterm election, but the crucial Georgia election, a DOJ cover up." Why did they do that? I wonder. According to the great Maria Bartiromo -- she is great -- on "Mornings with Maria," the Justice Department has shown us that this has been a double standard, a totally double standard.

If you're a Republican or especially if you're a Trump Republican, they go after you. If you're a Democrat, you can do anything you want, including murder. Just take a look at Antifa and BLM. But Maria Bartiromo gets it, and there's no doubt about that. Also election interference was in effect given the fact that they sat on this information, and we didn't know until January, long after the election was over.

This is a disgrace to our country. It's a disgrace to free and fair elections, which they weren't. Thank you.
