Our farmers are brilliant. What they do is incredible.

If you look at the technology, and the kind of things that have taken place over the last 10 years on farms -- not only the operating of tractors, which are like operating airplanes nowadays, they're so complex -- but the kind of planting you do, and what's happened with respect to farming, it's one of the industries, I think, that not only has become very complex, but has grown in so many ways.

So I just want to thank our farmers. I want to thank you for the support. You're brilliant, in every way. Few people could do what you do.
