The Democrats are absolute hypocrites. All along, they've been supporting walls and supporting fences and supporting all sorts of border security.

The fact is they've always supported fences and walls and partitions, but you know what? They only don't want to do it because of me. They have to put the people ahead of politics.

We need to have the wall. We need border security. Whatever it takes to get border security, I will do it. I pledged that a long time ago, and I will pledge it always.

We've done a really fantastic job with what we have. We can do an almost perfect job, if we have the wall and proper border security, and that is what we're going to do for the American people. Thank you.
