Patriotic Americans are being prosecuted for peacefully protesting a stolen election. Let them go. They were convicted or are awaiting trial based on a giant lie, a radical-left con job. Thank you to Tucker Carlson and Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy, for what you both have done. New video footage is irrefutable, absolutely irrefutable.

Thank you very much. We have to fight for our country, and we have to fight like we've never fought before. Our country is great, but it's in tremendous trouble. We're a nation in decline. We have to stop being called a nation in decline. They're laughing at us all over the world. We're not going to let that happen any longer.

Thank you.
