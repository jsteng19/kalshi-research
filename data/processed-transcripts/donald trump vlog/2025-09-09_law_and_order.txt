For far too long, Americans have been forced to put up with Democrat-run cities that set loose savage, bloodthirsty criminals to prey on innocent people. Really, very, very innocent people. In every place, they control radical left judges, politicians, and activists. And they've adopted a policy of catch and release for thugs and killers.

In Charlotte, North Carolina, we saw the results of these policies when a 23-year-old woman, who came here from Ukraine, met her bloody end on a public train. And here is a picture of it. This is the picture of it. And this is a picture of the woman, a beautiful young girl that never had problems in life, with a magnificent future in this country. And now she's dead.

She was slaughtered by a deranged monster who was roaming free after 14 prior arrests. We cannot allow a depraved criminal element of violent repeat offenders to continue spreading destruction and death throughout our country. We have to respond with force and strength. We have to be vicious, just like they are. It's the only thing they understand.

Twenty four of the top 25 most dangerous cities in America are run by Democrat mayors. Fifty people were murdered in Chicago in recent weeks, with hundreds being shot. And it's time to stop this madness. The people of our country need to insist on protection, safety, law, and order.

We have proven that it can be done, because we did it right here in DC, in District of Columbia. The capital of America was a bloodthirsty, horrible, dangerous place. One of the worst. And now it's a crime-free city, and we're going to keep it that way. It can be done. It can happen fast. All we want is -- please, Mr. President, we need help.

Chicago needs help. Other cities needs help. We'll do what has to be done because we're going to make America safe again, and that includes our big cities. We're going to make those cities safe. Thank you.
