Next week, I'm going to be at the United Nations in New York, and I've always said the United Nations has tremendous potential. But it has not lived up to that potential.

It's always been surprising to me that more things aren't resolved, because you have all of these countries getting together in one location, but it doesn't seem to get there. I think it will.

Again, I look forward to being at the United Nations next week. We're going to make a speech. We're going to have many meetings. A lot of good things can happen. Thank you.
