Drain the swamp -- and that's what we're doing. Now when I said it, it sounded very easy, and it was going to happen real fast. I didn't know the swamp was this dirty and this deep. I didn't know about the swamp creatures being as bad as they are.

They're bad, but nobody can believe what we've been able to do, and I don't really believe anybody else could have done it. Drain the swamp. We're not finished yet, but we're getting really close. Give us four more years.

Go out and vote. The most important election of a lifetime may be the most important election ever in our country. Go out and vote. Thank you very much. Go to the voting booth, and vote early and in-person. Don't let them take your vote away. The most important election we've ever had. Thank you.
