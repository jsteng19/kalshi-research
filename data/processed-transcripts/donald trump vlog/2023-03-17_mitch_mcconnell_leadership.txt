The Republicans in Congress ought to demand the $6 trillion that Mitch McConnell gave to the Democrats and demand that it get back. Put it back. Put it back in our Treasury. It's all Green New deal and things that nobody wants, causes massive inflation. But demand it back before they even think about the debt ceiling vote.

A great way to cut spending, much of it wasted on so many things that we don't want.
