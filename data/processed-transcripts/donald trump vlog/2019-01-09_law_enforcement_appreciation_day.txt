This is Law Enforcement Appreciation Day, and nobody appreciates you more than the President of the United States. Everybody knows what you do, and everybody cares.

Without you, it just couldn't be the same. It would be really bad. So, again, thank you and have a great Law Enforcement Appreciation Day.
