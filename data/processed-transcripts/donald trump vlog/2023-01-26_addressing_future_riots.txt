The violent and vicious riots in Atlanta carried out by the anti-police radical-left anarchists are an abomination, and it has to stop. These extremists smashed windows, set fire to a police cruiser, destroyed businesses, laid waste to downtown Atlanta, and were even found carrying explosives. They wanted to kill people.

They didn't quite have that opportunity, but they would have and they wouldn't have lost any sleep over it. Unfortunately, nothing will happen to most of these rioters because of the Marxist prosecutors who have seized control of the justice system in Atlanta, just like they are in New York, just like they have in other places.

As always, it's hardworking, law-abiding citizens of all backgrounds who pay the price for this radical-left extremism sponsored by George Soros it seems. The rioters who attack our wonderful police officers and destroy so many lives must be punished to the fullest extent of the law. And when I'm president again, if Marxist prosecutors betray their oaths and refuse to protect our citizens, I will not hesitate to send in federal law enforcement to restore peace and public safety.

We will restore law and order in America. We've never seen anything like is happening right now. Crime is up by 50, 60, 70, and 100 percent in these radical-left Democrat-run cities. We can't let it happen. Our country is going to hell. We're going to make America great again. Thank you.
