We've been fighting for a long time in Syria. I've been President for almost two years, and we've really stepped it up, and we have won against ISIS. We've beaten them, and we've beaten them badly. We've taken back the land, and now it's time for our troops to come back home.

I get very saddened when I have to write letters, or call parents, or wives, or husbands of soldiers who have been killed fighting for our country. It's a great honor. We cherish them, but it's heartbreaking. There's no question about it. It's heartbreaking.

Now, we've won. It's time to come back. They're getting ready, you're gonna see them soon. These are great American heroes. These are great heroes of the world, because, they fought for us, but they've killed ISIS, who hurts the world, and we're proud to have done it.

And I'll tell you, they're up there looking down on us and there is nobody happier, or more proud of their families, to put them in a position where they've done such good, for so many people. So our boys, our young women, our men, they're all coming back and they're coming back now. We won, and that's the way we want it, and that's the way they want it.
