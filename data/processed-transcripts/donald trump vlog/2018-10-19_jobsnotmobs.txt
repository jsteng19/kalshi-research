The Democrats don't like being called an angry mob, but really that's what they become. They've gone so far left, they can't even believe that they're over there, they don't know what's going on when you listen to Eric Holder, talking about kicking...

...or Hillary Clinton, saying what she said, which was so horrible...

They just don't see it. Maxine Waters constantly --  day in and day out -- ranting and raving...

They're losing it, and they shouldn't be. We should be a unified country. It'll happen some day.
