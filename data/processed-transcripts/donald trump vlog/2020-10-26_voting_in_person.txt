So important for you to go out and vote in person. This is the most important election of our lifetime. Maybe, it's the most important election in the history of our country, because you see what they're doing with the radical left. These are radical left people. They want to turn our country into a socialist state.

They want to, as an example, in Texas, or Pennsylvania, or Oklahoma, or North Dakota, or Ohio, they want to take away your fracking. They want to take away your energy. Frankly, no oil, no guns, no God. Very simple: no oil, no guns, no God. They want to spend the money -- all of this money -- they want to raise it -- raise your taxes to a level that's never been done before, and they want to spend it on this ridiculous Green New Deal, which makes no sense whatsoever.

You've got to go out and vote. Go out to the polling booth. Vote in person. Most important election we've ever had. Go out and vote in person. Thank you. Go to the voting booth and vote early and in-person. Don't let them take your vote away. The most important election we've ever had. Thank you.
