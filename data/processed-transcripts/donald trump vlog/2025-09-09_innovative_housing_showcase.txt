Hello to everyone attending the Innovative Housing Showcase on our National Mall. Very exciting. Under the Trump administration, we believe that affordable home ownership is a fundamental part of the American dream, and we're working every day to make that dream a reality for millions and millions of Americans.

I've been a builder all my life. I built things. I was a real estate developer. I know what it is, and I'm thrilled to see some of our nation's greatest architects, engineers, and innovators coming together to highlight cutting-edge technologies and new ideas for housing construction.

With Secretary Turner at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, who's a great guy, we're slashing permitting delays and eliminating a record number of costly regulations.

We're also defeating inflation. Uh, we took over the worst inflation in the history of our country, and we beat it, bringing down mortgage rates, reducing energy costs, and unleashing incredible economic growth like this country has never seen before. Together, we can put millions more American families in a home of their very own. I just want to thank you, and have a great showcase.
