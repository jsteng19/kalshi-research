Remember, the DOJ is running the local Manhattan DA's prosecution. They just don't want to have their fingerprints on it. They placed a top person in the office of the district attorney. Nobody knows that, but that's the way it is. They don't want to be known for doing it, but that's what they're doing. And you know what?

The American people aren't going to take it. Thank you.
