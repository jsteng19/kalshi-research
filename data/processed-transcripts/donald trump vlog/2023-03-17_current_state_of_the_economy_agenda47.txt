Joe Biden has been a disaster for the economy. Between his massive tax hikes, his anti-energy crusade, and his trillions of dollars in wasteful spending, Biden caused the highest inflation in almost half a century. As a result, interest rates soared to crushing levels. And now, we are seeing bank failures that nobody believed even possible just two years ago.

Joe Biden is leading us toward a Great Depression. I've been saying it for a long time. There should be no bailouts. But we need to get this economy straightened out as fast as possible. We're headed down a very dangerous path. When I'm back in the White House, I will immediately unleash energy production, slash regulations like I did just three years ago, and repeal Biden's tax hikes to get inflation down as fast as possible, and it will go quickly, so that interest rates can get back under control.

I built the greatest economy in the history of the world. In fact, I did it twice when you think about it. And now, we will have to do it again. Thank you very much.
