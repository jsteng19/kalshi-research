The destruction caused by Hurricane Michael is incredible, far greater than we've seen in a long, long time. When you look at Florida, when you look at Georgia, and all the other places that were affected, what's happened is really incredible. We just haven't seen this.

But we're working hard. FEMA, first responders, law enforcement, they're all really on it. Food is being supplied, water is being supplied, electric companies are all over. A lot of the electricity is already back, but much of it is going to be happening in the next short while.

So I know how tough it's been, but we're with you 100%. It's all getting done, and it's getting done rapidly and correctly. Thank you very much.
