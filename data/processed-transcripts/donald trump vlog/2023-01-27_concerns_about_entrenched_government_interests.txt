One of the very same FBI officials who were centrally involved in the launch of the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax has now been charged for himself colluding with a Russian oligarch, in other words colluding with Russia. Charles McGonigal was allegedly paid a quarter of $1 million by a former Russian intelligence official even while he was still working for the FBI trying to frame the president of the United States, your favorite president, me, as a Russian spy.

I said, "I'm not a Russian spy. Where does this all come from?" This was a setup. This was a hoax. This was a total international disgrace to our country. This latest example of galling corruption and hypocrisy is one more reason why we need a president to clean house in Washington, D.C. and restore a government that is honest, transparent, and accountable to the American people.
