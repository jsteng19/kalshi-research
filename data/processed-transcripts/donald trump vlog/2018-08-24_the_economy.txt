It's said now that our economy is the strongest it's ever been in the history of our country, and you just have to take a look at the numbers. Unemployment: all-time historic lows. Black unemployment, Hispanic unemployment, Asian unemployment, Women unemployment. These are records that are being set on a weekly basis.

Our country is doing phenomenally well. We're going all the way. You look at what's happening outside of the United States, it's not a pretty picture. Inside of our country, we are just setting records and I'm going to keep it that way.

We have a lot of potential. We have a long way to go. Great trade deals are being negotiated right now. We're doing some great great trade deals. When that happens, your 4.1 is going to go even higher. We're having a lot of fun.
