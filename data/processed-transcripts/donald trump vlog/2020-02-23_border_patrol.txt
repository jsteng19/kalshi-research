I just want to thank and congratulate our incredible United States Border Patrol. Unbelievable heroes. Unbelievable job. A part of law enforcement. Very very special. As you know, eight months in a row, our numbers are down, way down. That's down in a positive way, not in a negative way.

It's incredible what you've been able to accomplish, and you do it with a lot of fake news and a lot of nasty statements. But let me tell you: this country respects you. They admire you, they admire the work you do, and you have a friend in the Oval Office, and always will as long as I'm here with our great Vice President, who's standing right alongside of me -- you have a friend in the Oval Office.

So, I want to thank you for the great job you've done. I appreciate, on behalf of Mike Pence and myself, thank you very much.
