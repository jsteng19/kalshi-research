Passover is truly the story of strength of the Jewish people, and for the Jewish people. I want to wish everybody a very happy Passover. But this year is going to be different. You won't be sitting tightly knit together in temple. You'll be at your homes. You'll be helping our country, frankly.

We want to get together really soon. We want to be together. But one thing we have seen: we've seen tremendous unity as a nation, and everybody has really helped.

So, to all of my Jewish friends, I just want to wish you a very, very happy Passover.
