With what is happening to our economy and with the proposals being made on the largest and dumbest tax increase in the history of the U.S.A., times five -- I figure times five, maybe more than that, Joe Biden will go down as the Herbert Hoover of the modern age. You know who Herbert Hoover is, right? We may have a Great Depression, far bigger and more powerful than even that of 1929. As proof, the banks are already starting to collapse.

We cannot allow a depression to happen. There is no reason for this. We cannot allow it to happen. Thank you.
