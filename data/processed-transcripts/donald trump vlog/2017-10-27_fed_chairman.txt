People are anxiously awaiting my decision as to who the next head of the Fed will be. I'll be announcing it sometime next week. It will be a person who hopefully will do a fantastic job. And, I have somebody very specific in mind.

I think everybody will be very impressed. But most importantly I think at the end of eight years you really will be impressed, because things are looking good. They're looking good for our country, and they're looking good for our country's economy.

So work hard. You've got a lot of jobs coming into our country. Go out and get a good one. Wages are going up. Economy is strong. Have fun. God bless America.
