A really big factor in this election is the fact that Joe Biden and Kamala want to raise your taxes, and raise them like nobody's ever been raised before. It will be the biggest increase in the history of our country, and we can't let that happen, because it'll drive our country into a depression. Your 401(k)s will crash, your stocks will crash, your home values, will crash.

Everything will come down. You can't have it. We can't let it happen. The Wall Street Journal just estimated that if you do this crazy Biden plan, you'll lose $6,500 of your wealth every year over a short period of time. So, bottom line: we can't have an increase in taxes. I'm going to substantially reduce your taxes.

They're going to substantially increase your taxes. Get out and vote. You must get out and vote. This is the most important election in the history of our country. There's never been an election so important. Taxes is big, but we have a lot of other big points. But I have to point out: they want to raise your taxes more than anybody has ever raised them before.

We can't let that happen. I'm cutting your taxes. Thank you. Go to the voting booth, and vote early and in-person. Don't let them take your vote away. The most important election we've ever had. Thank you.
