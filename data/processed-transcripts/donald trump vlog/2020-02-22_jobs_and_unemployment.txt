Look at what's happening with jobs. Look at what's happening with unemployment right now in our country. We have more people working by far than ever before, almost 160 million people.

Regulations have been cut, taxes have been cut and, of course, the biggest con job that I've ever heard and that's exactly -- I hate to use certain terms, but that's exactly what it is, it's a con job -- is that this really happened because of the Obama administration. Just the opposite. The Obama administration had the worst recovery in history since the Great Depression.

If that concept continued -- meaning, increase in taxes, instead of lowering in taxes, and also many more regulations -- and we were already stuffed with regulations -- people couldn't move, they couldn't build, they couldn't do anything -- you would have had an economy that would have been a disaster. I think it would have gone down by 50 percent, and maybe even more than that.

Instead, the stock market is up 80 percent -- in some cases, much higher than that. 401(k)s are at record levels. People are up 60, 70, 80, 90 and 100 percent, and even more than that.

So I just want to tell you: this has been truly the great American comeback, and I'm very proud to be associated with it. We've never had anything like this before in the history of our country. Thank you.
