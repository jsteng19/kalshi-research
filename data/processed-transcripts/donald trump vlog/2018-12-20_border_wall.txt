I'm fighting very hard for border security. So important. I've already started building the wall. We've built large sections, and we're fixing up a lot of other sections that are a mess.

But the fact is: we need the wall. The Democrats know it. Everybody knows it. It's only a game when they say you don't need the wall. You can look at their eyes and you can say, well they're not telling the truth.

They want to try and do anything possible to hurt us, because of the fact it's politics. I understand that. I don't even hold it against them, except you should always put your country first, and they're not doing that. They're putting politics first.

We have to build the wall. It will get built. We're going to complete it. A lot of progress has been made. Watch what happens.
