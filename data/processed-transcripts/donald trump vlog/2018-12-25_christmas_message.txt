Melania and I are truly thrilled to wish every American a very Merry Christmas.

At this time of year, Christians celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ. This wonderful season brings out the best in the American spirit, and we see neighbors helping neighbors, and communities lifting up those who need a helping hand. We see citizens laying wreaths at the graves of our fallen heroes. We see children bringing joy to our senior citizens, and we see Americans of all ages caring for people in need. We reflect on the splendor of God's creation, and the sacred ties that bind us all together.

On behalf of the entire Trump family, we wish everyone a Merry Christmas, and a very, very Happy New Year.
