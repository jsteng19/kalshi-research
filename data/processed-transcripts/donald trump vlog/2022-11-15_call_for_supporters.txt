Hello, everybody. I'm pleased to announce that I'm running for president of the United States. And together, we are going to make our country safe, prosperous, great, and glorious again. Under Joe Biden, we're a nation in decline, but our movement has the power to save America, and we must do that. We can, once again, build the greatest economy in the history of the world.

We can bring back strong borders. We can give our police the support they need and the respect they deserve. And we can restore hope to communities all across our land. This campaign will decide the fate of our entire nation, and we must win. I'm asking each of you to join us in this great national effort.

Get online, sign up, donate, take action, volunteer, get organized, talk to your neighbors. Together, we will save our country, and we will make America great again.
