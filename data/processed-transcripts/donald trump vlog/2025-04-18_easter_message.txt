On Easter Sunday, we celebrate his glorious resurrection and proclaim, as Christians have done for nearly two thousand years: He has risen. Through the pain and sacrifice of Jesus on the cross, we saw God's boundless love and devotion to all humanity. And in that moment of his resurrection, history was forever changed with the promise of everlasting life.

As we approach this joyous Easter Sunday, I want to wish Christians everywhere a happy, and beautiful, and blessed holiday. America is a nation of believers. We need God. We want God. And with his help, we will make our nation stronger, safer, greater, and more prosperous, and much more united than ever before.

Thank you to everyone, and have a really happy Easter.
