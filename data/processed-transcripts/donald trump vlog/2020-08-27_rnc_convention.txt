We've had a really great convention so far. It's all about glory, and success, and making America great again. We want success. We want to bring our country to a point that it was at, and even beyond, because before the China virus came in, we had set every single record in the book, and now we're doing it again.

If you look at employment numbers, if you look at jobs, if you look at so many different things, we're doing it again, and I think next year, we'll be even more successful than we were before the virus came in. So I just want to thank everybody. It's been an incredible week. This is an incredible party. This is a party of optimism and strength.

It's an honor to be representing the Republican party, the party of Abraham Lincoln, and if you want to help, text vote to 88022. My team will send you everything that you're going to need to vote and secure your ballot, so we can make america great again. It's happening faster than we even thought. We did it once, and now we're going to do it again. Thank you very much.
