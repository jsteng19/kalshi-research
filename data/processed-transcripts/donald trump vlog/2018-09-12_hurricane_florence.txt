Hurricane Florence is fast approaching. It's going to be here over the next 48 hours, and they say it's about as big as they've seen coming to this country, and certainly to the East Coast, as they've ever seen.

We'll handle it. We're ready. We're able. We've got the finest people, I think, anywhere in the world. FEMA and first responders are out there. They're going to stand through the danger of this storm.

Get out of its way. Don't play games with it. It's a big one, maybe as big as they've seen, and tremendous amounts of water. The storm will come. It will go. We want everybody to be safe. We're fully prepared: food, medical, everything you can imagine, we are ready.

But despite that, bad things can happen when you're talking about a storm this size. It's called Mother Nature. You never know, but we know.

We love you all. We want you safe. Get out of the storm's way. Listen to your local representatives. South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia: it's heading your way. It's probably not going to change paths. It's going to be hitting pretty soon. Be ready, and God be with you.
