It's September 11, and as I stand on the really beautiful lawn of the Rose Garden at the White House, I think of the 3,000 lives lost with the horrible attack on New York City, the World Trade Center, and, indeed the attack on our nation.

And when I speak of the World Trade Center, I speak as a New Yorker, but I also think as not only in New Yorker, but as an American, of the Pentagon and all the lives lost.

And also I just left Shanksville Pennsylvania. Incredible place, and these were really great great heroes that fought so hard, that the plane didn't do damage to either the White House, or the Capitol, or wherever it was headed.

So, whether it's Shanksville or the Pentagon or the World Trade Center: these were 3,000 incredible people. We never will let this happen again.
