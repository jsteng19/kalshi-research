To the great people of Jordan. You're a spectacular group. I have to tell you, you are very, very fantastic people with tremendous brilliance and energy. I want to just say that you have a King who is a tremendous man.

He's a leader. He's got a wonderful heart. He loves you so much. He loves his country.

He's done amazingly. King Abdullah II is one of the true great leaders of the world. And I just want to tell you, you're lucky to have him.

And I say that from my heart: you are very, very lucky to have him, and God bless you all. You have a great life. You have a great King.
