Crooked Joe Biden, the worst president in the history of our country by far, has totally surrendered our southern border. His weakness and extremism have resulted in a border invasion like we have never seen before. Other countries have emptied out their prisons, insane asylums, and mental institutions and sent us drug dealers, human traffickers, and terrorists.

Millions of people have poured into our country. And now, after nearly four years of his failed weak leadership, pathetic leadership, Crooked Joe Biden is pretending to finally do something about the border. But in fact, it's all about show because he knows we have a debate coming up in three weeks. The truth is that Joe Biden's executive order won't stop the invasion.

It's weak, and it's pathetic. It will actually make the invasion worse. Millions of people a year will continue to pour across our border and be released into our country. And we recently learned Biden is secretly granting mass amnesty to hundreds of thousands of these illegal aliens, along with welfare, government benefits, work permits, and jobs.

He's not doing that, however, for our veterans. He's not doing that for our homeless. He's giving illegal aliens far more than our veterans get, far more than our homeless get. Many of the left are even pushing for illegal aliens to vote in our elections, which is what this is all about. That's why they're allowing up to 20 million people since he took office.

When I was president, we built over 500 miles of border wall, stopped the flood of criminals, and we had the safest border in the history of our country. We need to secure our border once again. We need to secure our border once and for all. Crooked Joe will never get the job done. He doesn't want to get the job done.

It's just words and misinformation because he could have done it very easily. All he had to do is say, "Close the border." That's the power of the presidency. But when I'm elected, it will be my top priority. On day one, I will seal the border, stop the invasion, and send Joe Biden's illegal aliens back home.

They have to be sent back home because no country can sustain the damage that our country is sustaining. All over the world. Crime rates are going down because all over the world, not just South America, they're sending criminals into the United States of America. They're taking their drug dealers and their people in jail, lots of people in jail, they're taking their murderers, their killers, they're taking them all, and they're sending them into the United States.

In Venezuela, crime is down a staggering 67%. Because if you go to Caracas, if you go to the different places, they're sending their criminals into the United States. It's a horrible thing. And that's happening all over the world, many, many places, many countries. We're not going to let it continue. We're going to get them out.

We're going to bring our country back to safety. We're going to make America great again, greater than ever before. Thank you very much.
