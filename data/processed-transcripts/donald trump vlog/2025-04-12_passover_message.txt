I want to wish the Jewish people in America and Israel, and all around the world, a very happy Passover. Every year at this time, Jewish families celebrate Godâ€™s liberation of the ancient Israelites from slavery in Egypt, guiding them through the prophet Moses on a forty-year journey to a very, very promised land.

The story of Exodus, which is retold around the globe and all over the world at every Passover Seder, is a reminder not only of the enduring strength of the Jewish people, but of the importance of putting our faith in Almighty God no matter what the circumstance.

To all the Jewish families gathering with friends and loved ones this week, have a blessed Passover, and may God continue to watch over the Jewish people, the State of Israel, and the United States of America. Thank you very much.
