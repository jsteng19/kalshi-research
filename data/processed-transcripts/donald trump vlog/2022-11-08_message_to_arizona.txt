To the great people of Arizona, Maricopa County in particular, don't leave your line. Stay where you are. They say that the machines aren't working. They say that they're running out of paper in different locations throughout different states. There's a lot of bad things going on. Stay on line. Do not leave.

I know you don't want to be there as long as they're going to try and force you. They want to delay you out of voting, and you cannot let them delay you out of voting. So, to the people of Arizona in particular because that's the one that's come up right now, stay on line. Don't leave. Already, a lot of people have left, and it's very, very unfair what's going on Maricopa County.

Don't leave. Stay there.
