I can't believe it. I just heard that the worst mayor in the history of New York City, And without question the worst mayor in the United States, is now running for President. It will never happen. I'm pretty good at predicting things like that. I would be very surprised to see him in there for a long period.

But, it's just not going to happen. If you like high taxes, and if you like crime, you could vote for him. But most people aren't into that.

So, I wish him luck. But really, it'd be better off if you got back to New York City and did your job for the little time you have left. Good luck. Do well.
