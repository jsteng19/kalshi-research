The radical-left democrats are using their prosecutors to try and steal another election. There's never been a time like this in the history of our country. Presidential elections are sacred. We cannot let them be stolen. We can't let any elections be stolen. The only candidate they don't want to run against is Trump, me, despite their disinformation campaign to the contrary.

What they do is they pick out the one that they think is going to be the toughest, and they say, "That's the one we want to run against." They always say it. They say it for governorships, for the Senate, and for the president. But they don't mean it. They're all about misinformation and disinformation. I beat them twice, did much better the second time, and they don't want to do it again.

It will be a lot tougher for them to cheat and rig the election like they did in 2020. And that's why they're using their city, state, and federal prosecutors. They are using them like has never happened before in our country. Republicans in Congress are watching closely. The DOJ should stop. We have to get our country back.

The DOJ, the FBI, the local prosecutors should all stop.
