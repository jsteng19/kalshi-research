We have two standards of justice in our country, one for people like you and me and one for the corrupt political class, of which there are many. At the very same moment, when my ultra-secure Mar-a-Lago home was raided by the FBI, Joe Biden was harboring classified documents in his China-funded Penn Center and his unsecured garage, right on the floor, piles of paper.

The floor was probably very wet and damp, as many garages are. Yet, while I'm being persecuted by Trump-hating special counsel -- I call them special prosecutors, but this one, in particular, is a prosecutor and a Trump-deranged person. They prosecute all sorts of things. He prosecuted war crimes and war criminals -- Joe Biden, in the meantime, is being given white-glove treatment by a establishment hack who tried to cover up the Russia hoax.

He actually tried to cover it up. It's a travesty. Biden lied to the American people and weaponized the Justice Department, or as I call it the Injustice Department, to go after me for the very crime he actually committed. And he wasn't president, so he didn't have the right to declassify as I did. The difference is that while I did everything right, I did nothing wrong, Biden did everything wrong.

The boxes hoax should be dropped immediately against President Trump. When I return to the White House, we will end the era of partisan witch hunts, restore equal justice under the law, and get back to a government that delivers for the American people. And I mean securing our borders, creating millions and millions of jobs just like before, growing wages, stopping violent crime, and making our country great again.

That's what we want to do, make America great again. Thank you.
