Nobody in history did more for the farmers of our country than I did. I got them 28 billion with a B, $28 billion from China based on how they were unfairly treated before me by the Chinese government. They were treated very, very badly. People couldn't believe it. Nobody's going to win with the farmers.

But Donald J. Trump, I got them $28 billion. I saved ethanol, and I made farmers happy and rich again. And they're doing a fantastic job. And you know what? Someday, it'll become time for them to leave this beautiful Earth, and they'll be able to leave their farm without taxes to their children. I got rid of the death tax on farms so that when you do pass away, on the assumption that you love your children, you can leave it to them and they won't have to pay tax.

But if you don't love your children so much, and there are some people that don't and maybe deservedly so, it won't matter because frankly you don't have to leave them anything. Thank you very much. Have fun.
