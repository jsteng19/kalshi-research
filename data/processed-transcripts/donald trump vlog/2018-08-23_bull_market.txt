When I got elected, you had some people that said, this is going to be the greatest thing to ever happen to our country. I guess that's why I won. We had a lot of people.

But you had others that say, oh the market will collapse. Lots of bad things will happen. And take a look at what's happened. We have the greatest, longest, bull market in the history of our country.

They turned out to be wrong. Some have actually apologized, but very, very few. I think the rest will soon be apologizing, because, honestly, the American public demands an apology.

We are doing better financially as a country than we've ever done before.
