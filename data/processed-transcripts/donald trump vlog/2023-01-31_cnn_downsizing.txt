After many years, CNN is closing their Atlanta headquarters. It's very simple. No ratings equal no money. They got no money because they have no ratings. That's what fake news gets you. People are wise to it. Likewise, speaking of fake news, MSDNC, sometimes referred to as MSNBC, is in very big ratings trouble.

And be careful, Fox News, don't go that way. They've got failed politician, Paul Ryan and RINO Karl Rove, a total loser, running things. Please be careful, Fox News.
