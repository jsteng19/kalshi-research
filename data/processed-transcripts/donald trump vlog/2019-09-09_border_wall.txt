The media won't tell you this, but we're building the wall, and we're building it on an expedited basis. It's going up fast, and we're putting it where the Border Patrol most wants it. We'll have, by the end of next year, close to 500 miles of wall.

We're taking money from all over, because, as you know, the Democrats don't want us to build the wall. They're fighting us in every step, but our military has stepped up and they've done a fantastic job.

All of the renovated wall, and then the new wall that's going up -- 30 feet high. It's having a tremendous impact. It makes it so much easier for Border Patrol.

We've taken out thousands of gang members. We're taking them out. We don't want them in our country. We let them know it really strongly.

But I want to thank Border Patrol. I want to thank ICE. I want to thank all of the law enforcement. You're doing a fantastic job. Thank you very much. The wall is going up. It's going up fast.
