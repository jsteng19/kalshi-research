I'm able to put it aside and to think about other things. I can -- I'm very ambidextrous, so to speak. I can do a lot of things at one time. And I'm willing to do and able to do things and lots of different things. I run a business right now. But now, I'm starting to get full back into the campaign mode.

And we're really, I mean, doing amazingly well. It's the best numbers we've ever had. It's been incredible.

It's going very well. I don't think I'll be announcing before the convention. I mean, it just seems the convention is not too far off.

Well, to me, that's very cute because he's a very young guy and he's graduating from high school this year. He's a very good student, very smart, and I think that's great. I think it's very interesting, too. But he's pretty young, I will say. He's 17. But if they can do that, I'm all for it. I think I'm all for it. And he probably would be -- knowing him, he would probably be for it, too.

Sure, I am. I think, so far, it's showing we're totally innocent, and we did nothing wrong. This is not even a charge. The DA didn't even want to bring the case. He didn't want to bring it. And then, he brought it for political reasons. But this went through many agencies, many law enforcement agencies, and everybody dropped it. It went through the Federal Elections Commission.

They said, it's ridiculous. We're not going to do it. And that's the way it is. It's dirty politics, but I've gotten used to that.
