It's never an easy process. I think it's been very smooth considering there's tremendous hostility on the other side. I think it's been pretty smooth.

I do.

They do. They admit that.

Elijah Cummings was in my office and he said, "You will go down as one of the great presidents in the history of our country."

And then he went out and I watched him on television yesterday and I said, "Was that the same man?"

But I said, and I liked him, but I said that was really nice. He said, in a group of people, "You will go down as one of the great presidents in the history of our country." And then I watched him on television and I said, "Is that the same man that said that to me?"

Well, I think that some of it had to do with the election. They thought they were going to win. You know, winning the Electoral College is, for a Republican, is close to impossible and I won it quite easily. And I think they are still recovering from that, but they are recovering now. I think the Susan Rice thing is a massive story. I think it's a massive, massive story. All over the world, I mean other than The New York Times.

Huh?

Yeah, it's a bigger story than you know. I think --

I think that it's going to be the biggest story.

Take a look at what's happening. I mean, first of all her performance was horrible yesterday on television even though she was interviewed by Hillary Clinton's P.R. person, Andrea Mitchell. Course you've been accused of that also.

No, no, no. Mostly by a lot of people. So you know, we'll see what happens, but it looks like it's breaking into a massive story.

I think you're going to see a lot. I think you'll see a lot.

I think in terms of what other people have done also.

I think it's one of the biggest stories. The Russia story is a total hoax. There has been absolutely nothing coming out of that. But what, you know, what various things led into it was the story that we're talking about, the Susan Rice. What's happened is terrible. I've never seen people so indignant, including many Democrats who are friends of mine. I've never seen them acting this way. Because that's really an affront on them, you know, they are talking about civil liberties. It's such an affront, what took place.

I think from the previous administration.

I don't want to say, but --

I don't want to say, but you know who. You know what was going on. You probably know better than anybody. I mean, I frankly think The Times is missing a big thing by not writing it because you're missing out on the biggest story there is.

I think he's a person I know well. He's a good person. I think he may, you know, I think he shouldn't have settled, personally, I think he shouldn't have settled.

Because you -- should have taken it all the way. No, I know Bill. Bill's a good person.

I don't think Bill would do anything wrong.

You certainly covered O'Reilly big. Not Susan Rice, boy, O'Reilly . He's taking my place. He's taking my place.

No, you have a lot of information. No, you have so much information.

I don't want to talk about that.

No. I just don't want to talk about that. It's such an important story for our country, for the world. What took place.

At the right time, I will be.

I don't want to comment on anything about -- other than to say I think it's a -- I think it's truly one of the big stories of our time.

Do I think?

Yes, I think.

We want to do a great infrastructure plan, and on that side I will say that we're going to have, I believe, tremendous Democrat support. We are also going to have some good Republican support, and I think it's going to be one of the very bipartisan bills and it's going to happen. I may put it in with health care.

Yeah. I may put it in with something else because it's a very popular thing. We've spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, as of two months ago. Uh, $6 trillion. And yet we can't fix our own roads and our own highways. And our bridges, which are, in many cases, in very bad shape. And we're going to have a very big infrastructure plan. And bill. And it's going to come soon. And I think we'll have support from Democrats and Republicans.

I am. I'm thinking about accelerating it. I'm thinking about putting it with another bill. Could be health care, could be something else.  Could be tax reform.

Well, we're working -- you know when people said, when you guys, because you know we have a very solid administration. We have some very, very good people. This man was the president of Goldman Sachs. I mean, he was, like, the president of Goldman Sachs.

And believe me, they wanted him. But he wanted to do something more important. As he said, as big as Goldman Sachs are, it was --

-- and is. The numbers here are staggering. He did the biggest deals in the world. They were, like, tiny deals. They were like peanut deals. But, but we just have a great group of people.

We may go public/private on some deals. We're going to do a very big -- you know, the money that was squandered by the past administrations. Squandered on airplane routing systems that don't work. That, you know -- what would you call the actual system itself? What would you say just so they know?

It is so bad. It's so out of whack. They had all of these different companies hired. Tremendous amounts of money was spent. And they don't hook up. They didn't hire one company. They don't hook up.

No. More than that. Much more than that.

We're talking about a trillion-dollar infrastructure.

We may take that trillion, and we may also in addition use public/private. But we're talking about an investment of a trillion dollars.

On roads, on bridges, on many different things. And it's also going to be -- we have to refurbish to a large extent. You know, we can build new highways, which are much more expensive. And sometimes they're the highways to hell. You know they're called, like the Second Avenue subway, the tunnel to nowhere. Which, after spending 12 trillion, 12 billion dollars, they realize it now. But you know when they built the Second Avenue subway, you know they never knew where it was going. Did you know this? This was one of the great of all time. And then they ended up finishing it.

Nothing is accurate now because we haven't made a final determination. We haven't made a determination as to public/private. There are some things that work very nicely public/private. There are some things that don't. The federal government, we're doing very well you saw, a lot of good numbers coming out. You saw our imports. You saw what happened with China. And various other people that this country has been dealing with over the years. You saw the numbers come out today, they're very promising. Lot of good numbers are coming out. We are borrowing very inexpensively. When you can borrow so inexpensively, you don't have to do the public/private thing. Because public/private can be very expensive. When you go equity, when you give equity to people who own your highways essentially for a 30-year period, who own your tollbooths for a period of time -- come on in, Mike! You know Mike and Reince?

Uh, we're working on health care. Can I just say, so when you called the health care bill, you know, that was just a negotiation. You didn't hear me say it's over. That was a negotiation. You understand? A continuing negotiation. It may go on for a long time or it may go on until this afternoon. I don't know. It's a continuing negotiation.

No, because they are desperate for infrastructure. That's the thing that they want second to -- that would be their second number -- that would be their second request.

I know it, but I can't tell you it.

The tunnel to nowhere, I call it.

For much of my life.

We don't want money being thrown out the window, as it has been for many years. Not just in Obama's years. I mean for many years.

Well, I may support them, I'm going to look at them. So what I'm doing -- is you know -- I did great in real estate in New York. I know all the developers. I know all of the folks. I know the good ones and the bad ones. And I'm setting up a commission of very smart people that know how to spend money properly. That know how to build on time, on budget. And ideally, under time and under budget. I'm setting up a commission. It's going to be headed by Richard LeFrak and it's going to be headed -- they're going to be co- -- Steve Roth. R-O-T-H of Vornado. Two very talented, smart, tough people. And they are going to, along with me, put on a group of 20 people, 20 to25 people on a commission. We're going to run projects through them. And they will have great expertise in that room. We'll have it from both coasts, and right down the middle. We're going to have representatives from various parts of the country that are all are very, very successful in terms of infrastructure. From different fields, but always infrastructure. But everything is going to be run by them. One of the things -- you probably saw what I said yesterday -- did you see where I held up the deal?

That's a highway. That's a highway. What is that, 17 agencies, Gary? Hundreds and hundreds of approvals. Some of which, statutorily, you have to wait six months before you ask for the next one. If we do the -- when we do the infrastructure, it's going to be very important to me that if we give billions of dollars to a state, like New York, California or any other state, that they're going to have to start spending that money, they're going to have to have approval within 120 days.

And if they don't -- well, otherwise, you'll give them money and they won't start the highway till -- which is something that no one has ever done.

It's been a long time. It's been a long time. It has been. I know the subway system very well. I used to take it to Kew-Forest School, in Forest Hills, when I lived in Queens. And I'd take the subway to school. Seems a long time ago --

I'd take it from Jamaica, 179th Street. Jamaica, right? To Forest Hills. I understand the subway very well. I used to ride between the cars.

They weren't thrilled when they heard that.

That could be the best statement --

No, they were not happy. I used to love to do that. Those were the old days.

I think it's in poor shape. The highways are in poor shape.

I think the airports are a horror show. I've traveled the world, I know the world.

When you look at the infrastructure in places like Iowa, in places like Tennessee and Alabama and places I won by massive --

God bless you. You O.K., Gary? That was a pretty tough one. I've got to make sure my man is all right.

When you look at the infrastructure of some parts of our country, it's really remarkably good. But you come back to New York and you look at the infrastructure of New York, you look at Van Wyck Expressway, you look at the medians, which, I would, you know, I've already got an order out -- the aluminum medians -- you've heard me talk about it.

Whoever the person is that owns that company is a genius salesman. That is the worst garbage. I think it bends by the heat, because not that many cars could possibly hit it. It's the worst garbage. And I also think it's dangerous because it's a spear. And if you hit those things, they come flying apart. And if you're driving, you've got yourself a problem.

Well, I used to.

It's a very important element.

I would say 10 percent more. Right now I'm focused on China. Focused on the Middle East. We're doing very, very well against ISIS, as you know. We just had a horrible thing happen yesterday.

I think it's a disgrace. I think it's an affront to humanity. Inconceivable that somebody could do that. Those kids were so beautiful. To look at those scenes of those beautiful children being carried out.

I was here. I saw it on television, I saw it on --

Well, I think it's a very sad day for Russia because they're aligned, and in this case, all information points to Syria that they did this. Why they did this, who knows? That's a level -- first of all, they weren't supposed to have this. Obama said, "It's all cleared away." Well, that's another thing he didn't do. This was a big moment, a big moment in the Middle East was when Obama drew the red line in the sand, and it was immediately violated, and did nothing. That was a big moment in the Middle East. I know you're not going to report it, but -- that was a big, bad moment in the Middle East.

If that were violated, you would not have had this happened. It couldn't have been any worse in the Middle East, because you have five million people, now they're all over the place, including millions of deaths, in my opinion --

I never talk about what I do militarily. I've been complaining about that for years. In terms of Syria. I just don't talk about it. People say, "Will you do something with Syria?" I just don't talk about it.

Well, I think it's very disappointing. I think it's very disappointing. Now this was done by -- the information is, this was done by Syria purely. But anybody aligned with Syria -- this is very disappointing.

And the trade is starting now, big league. It's a good point, Gary. The trade is starting. I mean, its started. You see it already. You see it in the numbers.

Yes.

Well, we're very much -- I don't want to announce it yet -- but we're very much set, my team and others -- uh, Steve Mnuchin, lot of other people -- we're very much set on the concept of the tax.

We want to see what happens with health care first. Because health care will affect taxes. Because, if we get the health care that we want, we're going to end up with great health care and were going to end up actually with a saving. And the saving will go toward a tax reduction.

Well, they're all friends of mine, Maggie. And you see that. They go out there and say, "We love our president." You know, I mean, they're all friends of mine. I won their districts, some of them, by 48 percent, 42 percent, 45 percent. They're all friends of mine. They've been great. Uh, I think you're going to see it coming together. You're already seeing it. I think you saw it yesterday.

Yeah. I do.

No.

No. I didn't surrender leverage. I'm not looking to gain leverage. I'm looking to get great health care. And the easiest thing for me to do would be to not do health care. Just relax. Don't do it. If I don't do that, other things happen. And I think it's time that we have -- because, look -- what's going to happen is Obamacare is not sustainable. It's over. It will be anywhere from six months to a year. It's over. It's over.

Now, if I want to deal with Democrats, Glenn, if I want to deal with Democrats, all I have to do is let it go a little further. You know, you have many states now, you have many states coming up where they're going to have no insurance company. O.K.? It's already happened in Tennessee. It's happening in Kentucky. Tennessee only has half coverage. Half the state is gone. They left. But I'd rather solve it in a much better way for the country.

And I think we have a good chance.

I am.

Me.

Because infrastructure is so popular that I might want to use it for another bill.

Very simple.

Because infrastructure is so popular with the Democrats, and pretty popular with the Republicans. A lot of Republicans want infrastructure, too. Number one, we need it as a country. We need it. We have to fix our roads and our bridges and we need it. And our airports, by the way, which are Third World airports. You look at these airports. They're horrible. I mean, you go to Kennedy. You go to L.A.X. These airports are horrible. I'm a person that, before I was doing this, I was in Qatar and I was all over the world and I was in different places in China, and you see airports, it's like we're -- we are Third World.

The point, the point is that infrastructure is in my opinion very popular. It's going to be bipartisan. And I'm going to use it in another bill. That's an important bill.

We're looking at that, and we're going to announce something very soon.

Yes.

We're going to make an announcement in two weeks --

-- on Davis-Bacon.

No.

It's an important question, actually.

It's going to be good.
