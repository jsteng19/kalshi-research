Well, they had a thing called the Paris Accords. I said, "No, I want the Pittsburgh Accords. I'm not interested in that." And that was an environmental deal that they were putting out in Europe. And, you know, they, I'm sure they meant well, but it was very unfair to America, and I terminated it. I got out paying a trillion dollars or some ridiculous number to be involved, and other countries are paying nothing, like always.

So, uh, yeah, it was the Paris Accords. And I said, "No, I want the Pittsburgh Accords." It's so interesting, and here we are in Pittsburgh.

Well, it does. Would you like to say something?

There's never been a group assembled like this. And now, you'd only know that, 'cause these are people that you've never heard of. Most people have never heard of them. But a person like me that's in the world of finance --

-- or David --

-- uh, we, you know, are there, because they're the biggest people in the world actually. And they came from all over the world and they're in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania investing, you heard 20 billion, 25 billion, 15 billion. The poor ones are gone for five billion.

And five billion is a lot of money.

There's no, no such thing as five billion for most people. And it's really great. Uh, but you know, and I can say it, I can come up with some, uh, good, really good ideas, common sense ideas, but it takes people like David and some of his friends in the Senate and the House --

-- to get it done. And you've done a fantastic job.
