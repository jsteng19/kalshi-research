I'm good. I'm watching these results. So far, so good, right? So far, so good.

Well, we seem to be doing really well. Wisconsin's been amazing. You know, every time I went -- I went there a lot, and we had these really big crowds. And -- and I've been to Wisconsin. As you know, I won it and -- but -- and I never had crowds the way we've had them, I would say, over the last month.

It was incredible. I went -- I've been there three or four times. And it was great. We -- we won, and now, I think we're -- I think they like me better. I like Wisconsin. I gave them the big shipyard contract, so I guess they like me for that, if nothing else. But I think they like me for a lot of reasons.

We helped the farmers. We helped a lot of -- a lot of different groups in Wisconsin. It's a great place.

Well, I hope so. I don't know. I'm watching it, and I guess we're up in six states and tied in one or down in one maybe. But we're -- we're leading in your state. We're up -- I'm just looking as we're talking. We're up in five or six states. So, that's good. A couple we're up pretty good, too. So, I don't know.

You know, it's very early. I mean, we'll have to see. I just -- there's been such a response, such a great response, as you can imagine, like closing the borders and not letting murderers into our country. You know, things like that which, you know, typically people would want. And we want people to come in, but we want them to come in, you know, through a legal process.

So, I think we're doing pretty well -- I -- you know, pretty much as expected right now.

Right.

Right.

Yeah. Well, the 2020 was, you know, really affected by COVID because you couldn't -- people didn't want to go out. People couldn't get -- you couldn't get security. Not us, everybody -- that people didn't want to go out and catch it and die potentially, right? So, it was a weird -- it was a very weird election.

The whole thing was weird. We did -- you know, we got almost 75 million votes and -- more than any sitting president in history, but it was very tough. We -- we have great people now. You know, we have people all over the place, whereas you couldn't really do that in 2020 because of COVID. People didn't want to leave their house actually.

Well, we're going to secure the borders. Yeah. We're going to secure the borders. We're going to let your farmers do -- big farms. And nobody's been better to the farmers than I have. And to -- just -- I love the farmers, and I've taken care of the farmers with the USMCA and the -- really with the deal I made with China where they have to buy $50 billion worth of our farm products.

The only problem is Biden hasn't pressed them on that. They can get a little bit tardy, but we've taken good care. We give the biggest ship contract. You know, we gave the big ship contract to Wisconsin and every state wanted it -- every state that does it -- about 12 states. And I felt it was very important to give it to Wisconsin.

I just had a great relationship with Wisconsin, and we're going to take good care of them. We're going to take great care of them.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Well, the Milwaukee thing is a big thing, and I think there's -- fortunately, we caught it. And hopefully, they'll do something about it. That's a lot of votes. And with respect to Detroit and, you know, frankly, Philadelphia, I guess is what we're talking about. It's just -- that's the rumor that's going around.

People are talking about it, and we can't let that happen. We just can't let that happen. If we -- if we let that happen, you know, we lose faith in our elections any more than we already have lost faith. It's terrible. So, people are talking about it, and they're -- they're talking about, in particular, Philadelphia and Detroit.

And then I heard that in Milwaukee, there was some kind of a miscount or there was a problem with 30,000 votes. That's a lot of votes and -- so, hopefully, they'll get that. I assume they're working on straightening that out, fellas.

OK.

Wow.

Right.

Well, I'm very happy about it. I know I'm doing very well with the Hispanics. They're great people, entrepreneurial energy and fantastic -- just very energetic, fantastic people. And I have a very special relationship with them, and I didn't know that I was doing well -- you know, well in those areas because those are tough areas.

But if you're winning those areas, that says something very good for the night. And you're right. It has a lot to do with certain sections of Georgia. And that would be indeed really terrific. Well, that's great information. Thank you.

Wow.

Right.

Well, it does. I heard we're doing well. Maybe you could give me the numbers in New York and New Jersey, but I heard we're doing well in New York and New Jersey. It's great. You know, they're not at all swing because they haven't been won in decades frankly but -- by a Republican, but I'm hearing very, very good things.

And how am I doing? Do you have any numbers in New York and New Jersey?  I'll turn it around

Yeah.

Well, I think it does. New York is a tough one. And it's a great one, but it's a tough one, as you know. And I do really well in certain parts of New York and in other parts of New York. It -- basically, it's not me. It's a -- it's a Republican  and -- but there is that rumor that I'm doing really well in New York and New Jersey. That's great.

Yeah.

Well, I think it's great. Joe Rogan is a fantastic guy and has a lot of power with his voice. And he -- we had -- we just had a great time. You know, we did -- we did really well together. We spoke for three hours, made me a little late for a meeting for a rally, but they understood. But we did -- we did really, really well together, and people liked it.

And it had like 150 million hits or something -- some crazy thing like that. He's very popular. He's a great guy. And then he endorsed me. So, that was -- that was something very special.

Yeah.

Well, I think, really, just that we want to have a great country. We want to have a safe country. We want to have borders. And we want to have low taxes. And we want to have a -- you know, a good economy. Right now, we don't have a good economy because inflation has absolutely just destroyed it. And we want to have a good economy.

And I think that's going to happen. I believe that's going to happen. It's going to happen very, very fast. I'm watching, as I'm talking to you, some of these states coming in like Florida. We're way up in Florida, way up in so many states. It's a beautiful thing to watch, but we'll see how it comes out.

And we want to have, you know -- what we want to have is an honest race. That's all we're asking for. You know that. And your -- your state has been fantastic. It really has. It's been great, and I really appreciate it, fellas.

Thank you very much, and I'll speak to you guys soon. I look forward to it.

Thank you very much.

Bye.

Bye.
