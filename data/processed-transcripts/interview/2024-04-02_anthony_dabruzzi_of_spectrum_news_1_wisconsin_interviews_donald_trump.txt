Yeah.

No, I think it's very important. It's a great state. I did well here twice, as you know, did very well in the primaries, and I did well in the elections, and won it handily the first time. And I think I did much better the second time.

Well, I think they want -- what they really want is safety. They want security. And they get that with me on the border, with law enforcement.

Right.

Well, you know, I've spoken about that. And what I'm going to do is make a statement on it next week. I'm going to have a formal statement, I'm going to make it in next week. And that's an issue that we should win. The Roe v. Wade issue is an issue that we should win. It was sent back to the states. The states are going to really dominate, and I think that's what you're seeing.

But I'm going to make it -- a statement on that next week, and it'll be a very concise statement.

No, not a change in position. It's going to be something that is very important. You know, you have to go with your heart, you have to go with your spirit. And it's going to be something that I don't think people would be overly surprised. But we also have to -- remember, we have to win elections. It's very important.

You have to win elections. Otherwise, you go back to the way you were. And I believe that the statement next week will be a very good one.

We have a great list of people, potential people. They all want to do it, that I can tell you. They all want it. And we'll announce that probably sometime around convention, maybe a little before.
