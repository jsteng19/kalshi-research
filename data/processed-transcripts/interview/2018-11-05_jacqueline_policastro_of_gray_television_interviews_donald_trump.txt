Nice to see you.

How are you?

Very good.

It's really not personal at all. We've done a great job. We have the best economy the country has ever had. People are running individual races. I'll take all the blame, and I'll take all the credit if they want. But it's really not about me. It's about -- we have great people, great Republicans, running.

It feels very much like '16. The Election Day, and just previous to Election Day of '16, there was a spirit that nobody has ever seen in politics. And, it really feels very much like that. I -- I just think we're going to do very well. I think Republicans are going to do very well. We'll see.

Well, we'll just have to fight it out, and we'll see, and maybe they'll come their senses. And, you know, one of the reasons I think they're not doing very well is the fact that they've become very angry. We say they've become mob-like, but the truth is, that's really what's happening.

Well, it's just the opposite. We're the ones that are really going to protect it. And if you remember, we -- we got rid of the individual mandate, which was the most unpopular part of Obamacare. We have premiums down to a very low level. The lowest level they've been in a long time...

And I agree, the Democrats seem to have the edge, PR-wise -- public relations-wise -- but we've actually done a much better job with health care than they have, and we're the ones that are fixing it.

Well, I think success is bringing us together. I think it's much more together than people would understand. We have an election coming up, and after the election, you'll see a difference in tone, I believe.

You certainly will from our standpoint. We have the greatest economy -- literally on Friday -- the greatest economy in the history of our country. It's being run by the Republicans and myself. Nobody's done what we've done in less than two years.

Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Thank you.
