It really is the great American race, and I look at this as almost a patriotism kind of thing. It's incredible. The people are incredible. We love the area. We love the state, and it's a very exciting. You know, I've been here four times before, as a civilian, and now I'm in a different capacity. We love NASCAR and we love the people of NASCAR.

I think it's really the bravery of these people. I mean, these are very -- you know -- they do all the safety things, and everything, but it's -- it takes great courage. It's the speed. It's really the technology. You look at what's happened just over the last 10 years with the cars. I love to see it. I love to watch it.

Well, you know, I'm not. But I think I've gonna reall -- right now. If I can, I'm going to hop into one of these cars and I'm going to get into this race if possible.

I love the idea. Yeah, I love the idea.

Thank you. Great honor.

Thank you.
