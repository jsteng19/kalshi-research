We think we have a really good shot at Minnesota.

Well, I never said I'd never come back. I never even thought of that. I thought I won in 2020 easily.

If I lose Minnesota, I'm never coming back. I don't care. I'm never coming back.

We think we have a really good shot at Minnesota, where we have great friendships up there. We've done a lot for industry. We've done a lot for everything in Minnesota, worked hard on Minnesota. Tom Emmer is very much involved.

The economy is killing everybody.

Minnesota is a great example of that. Minnesota is getting just absolutely killed by inflation.

Well, it's certainly something that has never been done before in this country. It's the witch hunts. It's the weaponization of government. You know, we have people from the Justice Department that are helping out the DA in New York.

Well, I hear that question a lot because the Democrats put it up. They say we have two unpopular people running, but I'm not unpopular. I'm at 95% of the Republican Party, which is higher than Ronald Reagan, who was at 86%.
