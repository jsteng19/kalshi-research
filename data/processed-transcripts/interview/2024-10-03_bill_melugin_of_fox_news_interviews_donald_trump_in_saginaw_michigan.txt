Well, they're doing a very bad job. They've given over $1 billion to illegal migrants that came in, and now, they have no money for North Carolina, for Georgia, for South Carolina, and Alabama, Tennessee, and Florida. I think that's a disgrace. This is a country that's being run by fools.

I mean, that's the craziest thing I've ever heard. That's the biggest risk we have. The biggest risk we have is nuclear.

There's no country in the world that would allow this to happen.
