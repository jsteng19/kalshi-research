Well, we haven't talked about that yet, Ali, but we'll find out and we'll see. I have a lot of respect for him, and I think he has a lot of respect for me. I've just heard this as news flashes. And, you know, we've had a good relationship for a long period of time. If he endorses, that would be an honor for me, but we're doing very well.

We're leading now, as you know, in the election, and we're leading in all of the major categories like border, like economy, like all of that. It's -- it's really good. It's really good. Things are happening that are very good. He may also see that. But it would be my great honor if he wants to endorse me. I have good respect for him.

Smart guy. A little different but very smart, and we will take his endorsement.

Well, I don't know. I know we're in the same state, but we're still pretty far away. But we'll see what happens. If something happens, you'd be the first to know, OK?

Thank you very much.

Yeah.

Yeah.

But you know what, can I tell you something?

We're in danger standing here talking, so let's not talk any longer. No, I know about it, but they don't want me standing here. They don't want you standing here either. Have a good time. Thank you very much.
