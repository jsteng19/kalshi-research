Thank you very much.

Thank you.

Right.

Right, we're sending a lot of money to Charlotte. We're sending a lot of money to North Carolina. It's been a great state. I love it. I love the people. That's why I'm here. That's why it's the first stop, really, in a true sense, and it's a happy day. We have a tremendous crowd. Great people.

No, I don't. I mean, I did nothing wrong. Most people acknowledge that, and most of the senators acknowledge that. The ones that said, well I guess maybe you shouldn't have made the call -- you got to make calls. You have to. Are we supposed to hide, we're supposed to not talk to people? It was a hoax. It was a total hoax perpetrated by Pelosi and the Democrats, and it didn't work, and our poll numbers, as you know, have gone through the roof and everything has, and it's been fine.

But it's something they shouldn't be doing, and no the president should have to do it.

I know. I think success does that, really. We're having tremendous success, the greatest success we've ever had in our country. Farmers, manufacturers. Look at your state. Your state is the number one state in terms of you having the best year you've ever had in North Carolina. And I think success does that more than anything else.

That's something that really shows, and we are setting records all over. In North Carolina, we've set every record.

Yes. It's a big deal.

Well very, very important and I'll be here a lot. You're going to see so much of me, you're going to say please don't come anymore. But I'll be here a lot. It's a very special place, and, you know, in North Carolina, as you know, I own property, I own, right on Lake Norman. A big club, a big golf club, and it's been tremendous.

And, you know, I've always liked the state.

No, I don't think so. I mean, there might be, because there are always protests, but we handle them. No, we chose the state for a reason. We like it. We like the people, and that's why we're here.

Thank you very much.

Good job.
