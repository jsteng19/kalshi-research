Well, I didn't do it for that reason. But, you know, a lot of groups are under siege in our country and they have been for a long time before I got here. You know, what was happening is things are changing too rapidly and not good. And so I saw them, they wanted me to make a tape that they play. And I've done it for three years now.

And I said, you know, I'm in Washington. Maybe I'll just instead of making a tape, I'll go over. Now, I didn't know it's was gonna be this big of a deal, but they have a lot of people out there and it turned out to be very successful, the most successful one by far.

I think we have a group of people that are just amazing and they've been with us and we've been with them. And we want to do what's right. We want to do what we feel is right.

Nicholas is a great young man and the Covington High School students were-- they weren't causing any trouble. And you could see it was building and building and building -- I hope he got a good settlement. Very unfair.
