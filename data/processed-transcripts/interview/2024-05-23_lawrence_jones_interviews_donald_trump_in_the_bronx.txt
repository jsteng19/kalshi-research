Yeah.

Well, because I've done very well with the vote. I love the people. They're incredible, they're energetic, they're entrepreneurial, and they're going to save New York. And we're going to win New York. And if we win New York, the election is over. We take over the country, and we take over the country --

I think we have a chance to win New York. It hasn't been done in, you know, many, many decades as a Republican. I think we have a very good chance. When you see the crowd nobody's ever seen.

Well, you have to ask the other Republicans.

Yeah.

Well --

Because I did things in office that nobody else has done. Criminal justice reform, I did criminal justice reform at a level that nobody thought was possible to get, and I did that largely for the Black and Hispanic community. They're the ones that wanted it. Opportunity Zones with Tim Scott, and he was so much in favor of it. And it's probably maybe the best economic development package ever for African Americans, for Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans.

We did a lot of things that people couldn't believe we were able to get done.

Yeah, I think it is coming together. I think it's come together for a long time. You have to understand, we did the nomination process the fastest in history. You know, if somebody else were running, they'd still be running for another month in order to get the nomination. We did it two months ago. The party is together.

I appreciate what she said. The party is together, and I think we're going to have a tremendous victory.

Yeah.

That's right. You were very funny.

Yeah.

Well, I won't forget you at the diner because when somebody else would blurt out, "Well, Nikki's doing well or Ron's doing well, or somebody," and you'd say, "That's not what I'm seeing out here." And then you'd go, "And it was all Trump."
