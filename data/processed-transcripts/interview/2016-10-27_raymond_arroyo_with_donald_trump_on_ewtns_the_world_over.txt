Thank you.

Maybe that... she was a... she was a terrific woman -- beautiful woman. She was born in Scotland, came here at 19 years of age; met my father; they got married.

They were married for 63 years or something, and they had a great marriage. It was very beautiful, but she was a very, very smart woman. And she was a very religious woman, actually.

Well, that never happened -- those were artificial. They were made up, just like at the rallies, where they made up, you know, they brought the protesters in. They paid them. They were thugs, and they, you know, they paid them, I guess, $1,500 or something and an iPhone.

That was artificial, and, actually, criminal, what they did. And nobody understood it at the time, and it was put in there by the Clinton campaign. This stuff was all made up. And so, I protested it.

And, actually, witnesses have come forward, and much of it's already been debunked, but it was all made up.

Well, it was locker-room talk; it was locker-room talk. The microphones, I mean, to be honest, should, you know, should never have been on, but that was locker-room talk. And it's just one of those things. I have it.

I've said it. I've made my apologies, but again, just one of those things.

Well, you know, I started with 17 people, and it was a very, very nasty primary, and they were nasty to me. You know, people think I was nasty, but they were nasty to me, and I ended up winning, you know; one in 17 -- and it was actually 18, if you want to be exact. And then, I have the final now with Hillary Clinton, and I hear we're doing very well in the polls, and we're doing very well in Florida, which is up now. The reaction has been amazing.

So we'll have to see what happens. But, no, look -- you can't go back. You have to look forward. This was a nasty campaign, and, you know, people don't mention, but they were nasty to me.

I think, in many cases, they were nastier to me than I was to them.

No, I don't think so. It depends; you react a different way for different people. These were 17 people coming at me from every angle, and, you know, I hit them hard. Most of them are now endorsing me.

Some of them dishonored the pledge: They signed a pledge, and they dishonored the pledge, and they'll have to live with that. But most of them have endorsed me.

Okay.

Yes, I am pro-life.

Right.

Well, there are a number of moments, but one was a couple that I know very, very well -- and you had a strong pro-life  and you had a strong pro-choice , and they argued over .... The mother was pregnant. They argued over the child.

One, I won't get into specifics.

But one wanted to abort. And the other said, "We can't do that. We're not going to do that."" Anyway

And the baby is such a magnificent person, who I know, a magnificent person. And the person that was actually pro-choice is now pro-life because of it, and it had a big effect on me. But I've seen other examples similar to that; but I've seen other examples, so...

It is a personal change. And, you know, Ronald Reagan made that personal change, too. Many people have made the personal change. I mean, some make the personal change the other way, also.

But I made the personal change, and I'm very happy with it.

Right.

Right.

Right.

...is intrusive.

Right.

Well, let me tell you: Religious Liberty itself, taken in the biggest picture, is in tremendous trouble. Okay? I mean, religious liberty in this country is in tremendous trouble.

I'm talking expression, and I'm talking anything else you want to talk about. People that are faith-based are not having, you know, they're just not having, they're not being accepted. It's almost like they're not being accepted in our country anymore. Obama has been a disaster, in terms of religious liberty.

And, one of the things I'm very proud of: I was with pastors, ministers, priests, rabbis, on numerous occasions, large numbers; and at the first meeting, I could see I had tremendous support like, beyond.... And I said, "When are you going to endorse me?"" And they said

And I said, "Why is that?"" And they told me about the Johnson Amendment

So we're getting rid... and I think it's one of the most important things that I'll be doing for the evangelicals and for religion. So, I think it's very, very important. So, we're going to get rid of the Johnson Amendment.

Right. Right.

Obamacare is killing our country. It's killing our jobs. It's a disaster. I've been saying it for a long time.

I've been talking about it for a long time, before it was even approved.

Whether it's health care savings accounts -- by the way, there are many things, but health care savings accounts are phenomenal. You have to break up the lines between the states so that we have competition. Once you create competition, those numbers will go so low, but you have to repeal and replace Obamacare. It's a disaster.

And the number of 25%: Washington came out?

Say, I'm sorry to say your numbers  gone up 25%. It's wrong. It's going up 50%, 60%, 70%, and next year it's going to go up again. It's going to get worse.

And Hillary Clinton wants to keep Obamacare going. And people are going to be paying hundreds; I mean, when you really look at it, they'll be paying 150%. It doesn't work. It's no good on its face.

It doesn't work. Never would have worked, should have never been approved. It was approved by a lie. I mean, let's face it.

Well, you know, who had said the same thing, and I won the last debate; according to everybody, I won it easily. But, you know, who really said it pretty well was Obama: When he was running in his first election, they asked him the same question. And he talked about rigged elections and rigged everything else. Our system is rigged.

Whether it's through the media...

Well, you know, Obama said it was. I mean, he said the electoral process is rigged. I mean, all you have to do is go back and look what he ran, when he first ran.

Well, if you look at research, certainly there's some of that going on. We can be babies and say it doesn't happen; but certainly, if you look at Philadelphia, if you look at Chicago, if you look at St. Louis, if you look at Obama's statements from eight years ago: Take a look at his statements, what he said about it. I saw it last night.

It was, like, incredible; he was far more outgoing, as far as that's concerned, than I am; but, overall, what I'm really concerned about is the system is rigged -- whether it's the media rigging the system, there are so many things wrong. Look: Hillary Clinton shouldn't be allowed to run. She lied. What she did with her emails, where she deleted 33,000 emails, she shouldn't even be allowed to run for the presidency.

She gets a subpoena from the United States Congress, and she deletes her emails. Now, James Cartwright, Gen. James Cartwright, may go to jail for five years because he lied to the FBI. She lied to the FBI probably hundreds of times, and she's allowed to do it, but a four-star general is going to go to jail? She shouldn't even be allowed to run for the office of president.

Right.

Terrible. Sure.

It's her.

It's her. It's her. She should apologize. I think she has to do more than apologize.

You know, that's her thinking. That's her staff. Frankly, if any Catholic votes for Hillary Clinton, you know, I would say, if I were a Catholic, I wouldn't be talking to them anymore. She's been terrible in what she said and her thoughts towards Catholics and to evangelicals.

She was mocking evangelicals, also. So, you'd say, why would an evangelical or a Catholic -- and almost, you could say, anybody of faith, but in particular, because they were mentioned, evangelicals and Catholics -- why would they vote for Hillary Clinton? And how could they vote for Hillary Clinton? But that's her speaking, believe me.

Well, it's her staff, but I think it's her.

Yeah, sure; I mean, this is the top person in her campaign. I think it reveals her, yes.

I, I don't want to talk to you about that. I mean, I pray. It's very personal to me. I'm a person of belief, but I certainly, you know, I pray for my family.

I pray for our country, but I don't want to talk to you about that. I think that's very personal.

It is between me and God, yes.

Well, I think that if you look, Mother Teresa, who's probably our newest, is great, and John Paul... Pope John Paul, I thought, was terrific.

Because he had something special. He had a special something. There was a warmth. There was a toughness, but there was a warmth that was incredible.

So, I certainly think, Pope John Paul.

Well, No. 1, I don't believe there's a five-point deficit.

It was done by CNN. And it was, you know, heavily skewed toward Democrats. I don't believe there's a five-point deficit; and if you look at the polling booths in Florida right now, if you look at where they're voting, the voting booths, I think you're going to see record crowds. That's what you're seeing.

It's only two days, but that's what you're seeing. And, I think, we're going to do really well.

There are many issues. The biggest issue right now is the judges, Supreme Court judges, but Obamacare is a massive issue. The Republicans have to get rid of it. They've been unsuccessful in doing it.

I will get rid of it. And I'll replace it with something much better and much less expensive for the people. Jobs have to stop leaving our country. Our military has to be rebuilt, and we need, you know, it's been very depleted.

The military has to be rebuilt. We have to take care of our vets. We have to protect our Second Amendment, which is under siege. And we have to have strong borders.

Right now, people are pouring into our country. Drugs are pouring into our country. We have to stop the people and the drugs.

I would say: She's crazy. I would say that it's one of the dumbest things I've ever heard. We have no idea. We're not vetting them properly.

We have no idea -- are they ISIS? Are they not ISIS? Where are they coming from? Who they are? We're taking them in by the tens of thousands right now, and Hillary Clinton wants to upgrade that by 550%. I would say to you it's crazy to be doing this, and I will stop it immediately. We will not have radical Islamic terrorists coming into our country, and some of them will be radical Islamic terrorists.

Well...

Now, let me ask you: Are you talking about for me?

I, I use, "big league."""

Good. Okay, good.

Okay. Thank you.
