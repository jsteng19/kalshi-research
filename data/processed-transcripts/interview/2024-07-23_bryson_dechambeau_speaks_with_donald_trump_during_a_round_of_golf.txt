Yeah. Yeah.

I mean, look at that.

Oh, never a doubt. This is going to be one of the greatest rounds of golf ever played.

I feel great, I feel great. I feel like I have the best player in the world right now, and he's a winner. He knows how to do it. I hear it's a very hard thing to do. It sounds easy, but it's not.

Because you need I think five eagles and --

So, that's not easy.

It's not easy.

But we're going to have fun.

We're going to have fun trying, right?

And you've had seven, and they haven't done it, huh?

That was something with Sergio, huh?

Come on, let's see him rip it.

Longest hitter by far, by far. I know them all.

Man, is that over the net? That's long.

It's very long, folks. It's very long. Yeah, yeah. We don't see it around --

We don't see that around here.

Come on, partner, let's go. That's so -- look at that shot, how good is that?

It's crazy. It's crazy. Would you rather be here or Doral? That's the only question. What is --

You know, you understand that, right?

This is a little more serene.

So, here's a hole. So, this is 500 yards from the back.

And these are the whites, blues.

It's just a great hole. I love the idea. So, you're playing from the reds?

Let's go.

We should be able to just close.

We should be close.

I think you can drive this sucker. I think you can drive most of them.

That's the big --

That's a big factor. See that hole?

You want me to lead off? OK.

That's pretty good.

That's perfect.

That's perfect.

Nobody's going to believe it. Believe me, it happened.

And that's a 3-wood, isn't it?

Oh, that's so great. So it's 299, 3-wood. That's pretty good.

Oh, it's very tough. It's just tough starting off. You're going to love it.

You're going to love this course.

Well, Aberdeen is so incredible.

Turnberry is rated No. 1 in the world. He went right by the hole, right?

We could use an eagle here, right?

Because you've got to get those five eagles. That's the hard part.

Getting the eagles.

Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah, that's right.

Mine was in normal good shape. His is crazy. Might be a little bit straight. So it goes both ways.

It's very quick.

Downhill. I'll always go first, and you'll see the line. What do you like there, Neville?

Yeah, I think so. Could be.

It almost is straight and then goes a little bit to the right at the end, but inches.

An inch.

Go.

He had the hard part.

That was right in the hole.

Yup. There's something nice about that.

So, this is normally 230 from the back.

It's the back corner.

I think you got to go with the A.

You think Biden can do this? I don't know. We had an argument about golf. Can you believe it?

Come on, partner.

Could be good. Oh, little much.

A good hit.

I think so. It's a good hit. Mine's right uphill.

Flat or downhill?

Right.

I think it's easier to make it downhill.

Probably it's an easier putt, too. What do you see there, Neville?

You'll go a little right?

Pretty straight, you know?

I think that was pretty straight, actually.

Oh, never a doubt. What a good putt.

They go in for you. They don't go in for other people.

So, it's -- that was a true 360.

Yeah.

Right. Oh, you know, you're right.

Yeah.

Pretty substantially uphill.

It's OK.

That's OK, pretty good.

Right at it, partner.

No trouble.

A little bit.

Yeah.

Well, oh, I have, I have -- yeah. I have a great playlist. I mean --

I have a playlist that's --

So, this is stuff that wouldn't have happened years ago. This is all good stuff.

It's too old for you, but I will tell you.

Oh, I have a lot of Frank Sinatra. We'll play this when we're finished breaking this record, if that ever happens.

Classic.

Nice and soothing, right?

That's some 5-iron. That is some 5-iron.

There aren't many people in the world can hit a 5-iron.

All right, partner, good shot.

What do you see there, Neville?

Right?

It shows a little more break than you thought, right?

Thank you.

That's great.

That's a great putt.

Bryson, you hit down -- you hit down on a putt, don't you, huh?

You mean sweep it.

You sweep. But you hit down on it?

Yeah.

Then you have to, yeah.

Yeah. Oh, that's terrible.

But on a normal putt, you're hitting it even pretty much, right?

Good.

We're getting a lot of birdies.

So, that's what you do. You get your eagles, right?

Then, if you get a little lucky with a couple of holes.

That's what you need.

Yup, that works. You're right. The par 3s are the rough ones.

Even if you're fairly close.

Right.

Wow.

And why -- with Sergio, how good he is, right?

Why didn't it -- it just didn't work, huh?

It's better. It's better.

There's an old landmark bridge that we moved.

From a different part.

Part of the property.

Great stuff, right?

Absolutely. This is a great part of the country.

So, I love Scotland because it's Turnberry. Turnberry got rated No. 1 in the world, as you know, which is very hard when I own something --

And it gets rated No. 1 in the world.

Some people don't like it.

Do you understand?

For me to get No. 1 in the world. And in Ireland, we have a place, Doonbeg, which is from --

It's phenomenal, right?

Don't you love it?

So, we go right down in the middle, partner.

Thank you.

Go right over the caddy's side.

Yeah.

Perfect.

It's fine. It's fine.

You won't be much --

You can't drive it.

We can get this close.

Yeah.

It's a little wet.

Yeah, don't hurt it because it's a museum piece.

Get up.

Good shot.

Still a good

It's a little wet.

You like that about 8 inches left there, Neville?

Do you like it straighter?

You putt with your shoulders?

Chest.

That could do it, partner.

Oh.

That's a beauty.

So, you putt with your chest essentially.

No hands?

Right.

Right.

You don't want to say the word.

But you are cool. That's great.

OK, I'm --

That's a great hole for --

OK, I'll put you out there.

Thank you.

Put it out now, as you go right at it.

There it is.

There it is.

A lot of movement.

You're not going to believe that green.

Every course has one of those greens. Great drive.

That's a great drive.

We'll chip it. But I think you're on the surface, somehow.

That's a lot. 300 yards uphill with a 3-wood.

Yeah.

That's it.

That's good. That's beautiful.

It's very -- it's very wet.

That's a nice one, partner.

That's a nice one.

That was a much tougher situation.

Yeah. It's a much tougher situation.

So, how nervous were you with the four-footer you had?

And how did you feel about that?

Rory had just missed it.

When you hit that, it was perfect.

Dead center.

Yeah.

You knew that you hit that well?

You know when you hit one a little bit off, right?

Right.

So, when you hit that ball, it was phenomenal. If you would have missed that putt, it would have been tragic.

You would have been branded.

They would have branded you.

Because that's the way -- they're cruel. Some guy that's 150-pounds overweight, he would have said, "He's a choker."

He's a choker, he can't play. So --

So, you got up and just had a good solid -- you didn't even think about it.

Dead center.

You know, I never heard this before. Gary Player told me this. And he won 168 tournaments and 18 majors in time, you know, 99. He said, "President, president," you know, he was very intense, "What are you doing?" Because I always teed it level with the ground.

He said the reason for a tee on a par 3 is you have to lift it up --

A little bit off the ground.

And I never heard that. I always thought bad players did that, you know, when I see guys lifting it up.

Can you imagine all the years I played golf?

He said --

He said the reason for a tee is because --

I always had it level. He said, what's the purpose of using it?

All right, partner.

Well hit.

Well hit. Thank you. I like that.

Sure.

Oh, that's good. Little left. Kick right.

I was just saying I guess you were --

I wouldn't have thought that. I thought you had almost a better shot than that, partner. What do you like there?

You think?

It's not that bad.

It goes both ways.

It's a tricky -- it's not an easy putt. Oh, did you see that?

We played six.

We have a par 4 coming up.

Very reachable par 4.

This is three, from this tee, 315 yards. So, I'll get it close, and he'll put it on the green, I predict. It's perfect for him. I think it might be -- yeah, he'll probably use a driver. Hard to believe he can hit a three with 315, too, but he doesn't want to swing too hard. So, yeah.

That's where you want it.

Thank you.

All right, partner, you could put that sucker in 315, right?

Might be too much.

It's pretty nice when you say 315, driver's too much. That's a good problem, is that right?

It grows -- it kicks right, partner, so --

Go left of the pin a little bit.

Great hole.

Yup, we can.

That's a three-wood, Mickey.

I thought I had a nice drive, but it was meaningless. They're meaningless.

Yeah, pretty much, huh?

You see how high that was?

Yeah.

Yeah, it's much bigger of a break than you think.

Maybe. Oh man.

I got to tell you this.

That's beautiful.

You were 7 feet left.

Did you see that?

It broke.

That was a great putt.

So, that was 10 times harder than the last one.

Yup. That's golf. You don't understand?

That was incredible.

Well, did you notice it straightens out at the very end? Probably -- you know, I like to make -- when I do two courses, I like to make them equal. I like to make them equal. So, we had -- we opened the other one 10 years before --

And was success from day one.

And then, I said, let's make this one links because, you know, they have two parklands, like  it's two parklands, right?

Might as well, you can do what you want, you know? So, we make it a links. And there's something nice about it. Look at that stuff. See that just grow --

See the trees in there?

They grow naturally.

They grow naturally. You can take them, put them out here. You have the nicest trees in the country.

Look at that. That's a maple right there.

Just grows. You know why? It's a very vibrant part of the world. This man can putt, let me tell you. He's driving the ball, but I may be more impressed with this putting.

Yup.

That's good. Right in that area is good.

If you go just a little left of the caddy --

You are perfect because it sort of kicks left.

And you can rip it.

Par 5. That's really good. I don't think you can hit it much better than that, Bryce. That's just a little short of the green.

That's a good drive.

So, you play a little hook then, right?

So, you don't like the stuff with the cutting, huh?

You know what's funny?

Because on the tour, 75 percent now are cutting it, right?

I'll say this, the little hook is prettier. I don't care what.

And I do a little cut. But the little hook is still pretty.

You're right up here.

Oh, lookie, lookie.

Oh, that's fantastic.

OK.

Very, very good step. Pretty damn good, partner.

You never thought about a putter. OK.

What do you see there right?

That was --

I always -- I thought I pulled it. I did pull it, actually.

That's all right.

Bryson, would you ever putt from where you were?

More and more people are doing it, right?

Now, in the Open Championship, formerly known as the British Open, which a lot of people don't understand, right, putting is like routine from there, right?

You will mostly putt.

Yeah.

Why is that, the grass is different?

It's like

Here's a nice hard hole for you, partner.

The water is on the right side of the green. It's -- if he'll show you, yeah.

You have to say --

The water's on this side.

That was an important hole, that last one, partner, huh?

That's a perfect drive, Neville. It was 50 yards further.

It would be on the hole.

Boy, that's really hit. It may be left.

You hit that grade, right?

Well, you stayed away from the water.

Right.

You see what happens, you can hit the green and go in the water.

Being left to the first is fine.

He's in great shape.

Is he OK?

What do you think?

It's a good call.

Good shot. Very good. I think -- is that up there?

I don't know.

I think this one is straight uphill.

Whereas this one is like the other one that you sank before, right?

So, this is a little closer. I'll let you call it, but --

What do you like better?

Let's go. You just sank this one.

This would be a nice birdie. This would be a very nice birdie.

Well, I hit three good ones.

Honestly, that wasn't --

You didn't -- you didn't do anything there, huh?

For a change. So, where was your ball? Your ball was right in here.

You probably, I mean --

In real life, you would have played that.

Yeah.

You were very nice. He said it's about time we used one of his drives. That's all. I think I liked his better. OK, what is this, Nev?

Perfect.

Yeah, I think that's fine, the A. You like the A? I think you hit it. Yup.

So, partner, we're on course so far.

But we played pretty good.

Thank you. That was a Gary Player.

Gary said when you're walking after it, it's always good.

Good old Gary. That's a piece of work, I'll tell you.

Whoa.

I think maybe 8 inches left?

I thought we had it.

I thought we had that.

That was pretty straight, I thought.

Yup. I didn't --

What a perfect stroke.

What a stroke. What a putter this guy is.

I've had a lot of guys tell me you're the best putter, your friends. That's a big one.

That was an important one.

Water dead left. See the reach?

You can't go -- yeah.

You have to go -- I mean, honestly.

You can't reach it. So, the best is you go way over that bunker.

Keep it right.

The water goes all the way down to the green.

See the white snake?

That's water.

So I mean the ideal thing would be those carts, but I don't know if you want to come that close.

That's a good shot over there.

It's fine because you just --

You just don't want to go left.

See the trap? Go right over it.

Perfect. Mickey, kids, that's the way I want you to hit a ball.

Well, it's dangerous because if you go a little left, you go in the water.

Which is the way it should be.

I just find it very relaxing. I play it well. You know, for a guy that plays as little as I do, I won so many club championships.

I play against guys that play all the time, but I'm straight. I hit it straight. I hit it onto the green, I putt well.

And a lot of guys don't -- and you know what it does? It takes everything off your brain. See, normally they say, "Nice layup."

All right, 108?

Thank you.

Yeah.

A little bit, right?

It might be mine.

One of them. What do you see there, Nev? This guy reads them good. He reads those greens good. He's a genius. He's a genius at reading greens, right?

I do.

If anything, who knows?

When in doubt, just go straight.

Right?

Goes a little right.

I think -- yeah, I think right here.

Right on the edge.

Oh, that one --

That's a tough putt, though.

How far is that?

Uphill.

OK.

Man, is that good.

Wow.

7-iron, Neville. I'll tell you, when you're uphill, it's much longer.

You know, it --

215

Yeah. Yeah.

I don't know. This couldn't be, but --

I don't know.

Those are two good ones. It was more at the pin, but --

That's great.

Yeah.

That was a big one, huh?

Well, I know, I guess, all celebrities in terms of a certain age --

But I knew them all, Sinatra. The only one I didn't know was Elvis. I never met Elvis. Elvis was one of the greats, right? But Michael Jackson, very well, lived in one of my buildings. Had his honeymoon in Mar-a-Lago. All very different people.

That was a big one we had there, huh? Let's see, where's my driver?

That's right there.

That's good.

That's really good, partner.

Neville, he's got good eyes. This would be a nice one for us to make, partner.

Nope, not much.

It goes that way.

Good shot.

Boy, that thing went right by it.

How many hole in ones have you had?

What do you see there, partner?

It was almost dead straight. I just didn't hit mine.

Good. Good. Good. Good. Good.

That's a hard hole, actually.

So, this is a par 5. This is our eagle.

This is our eagle right here.

No, but I've made eight.

Yeah.

I've had eight.

The last one I made with Ernie Els.

Yeah.

It was a five yard. It was 188 yards in Palm Beach. And I hit a per -- it's sort of into a little wind. I mean, I hit it perfectly. And Ernie was there, and we had some actually great players, Gene Sauers. He was a senior tour player. He won the Senior US Open a few years ago.

Ken Duke.

was there, we had -- they're all -- except for me. And I got a hole in one, and it was quite good.

Come on, partner.

So, where you're aiming -- the problem is if you go left, you'll never even find the ball again because that stuff goes for a long time. You basically have to go over the trap.

All right.

Should be OK. There's a lot over there. All right, partner.

I think go right over that trap, right?

The one in the middle. Don't go -- I wouldn't go left of it.

It gets nasty.

Yep.

That's perfect.

Yeah, it's perfect.

What a straight driver, huh? Well, you're known for that, in all fairness, long and straight. Is that 88? Looks shorter than that.

You know, Neville, that wind is in our face. You're short. You come all the way down to the bottom. I'm thinking about it, right?

I tried to swing too easy.

That's great. That's really good.

That's all you can do. Because you go short, you come all the way --

I don't know, it feels like right corner.

Part of that broke a little bit.

So, I guess maybe figure a cup. That was a perfect putt.

Yes, put whatever you want.

Just press it.

OK. I'll share something.

Let me show you something. You want to see some real holes, right?

But look at this.

That's US Open.

It's not these sitting things like in Oklahoma where, could you please move off the green, right?

But they're all -- and they're all like this. It's got the whole thing.

A little bit left.

That's the right club.

I think it's perfect, 296 into the wind --

3-wood.

Did it go down?

No.

No, because I could never compete with what I have, with Turnberry and with Aberdeen and all this.

Well, I can't -- you can't get the land anymore.

You could never get a piece of land like this next to New York.

Where did you go?

Yup.

OK, that's all right.

Yup.

Yup.

Yeah.

It's not easy. That was --

That was not easy. You hit the hole.

Yeah, we're playing pretty good.

Yup. These are great holes, too. See this one?

Look at that.

Now, this is the real deal.

Now, this is great. This is the real deal. Fazio did this. And I mean, like I'd leave trees, in theory, look at these trees.

Some of these trees are phenomenal trees.

I like some trees. I mean, I know it links and all that stuff.

You have beautiful oaks and this and that. I like them.

Anyway. Come on, partner, we can do this.

This is a drivable hole. Well, it kept us in it, Mickey.

That thing broke a lot, did you see that?

All right, partner, let's go.

Where is that, trap?

Oh, you might be in good shape. Well, this will be your lowest score, I think, right?

Oh, who'd you do 50 with?

Pretty good.

Yeah.

It's very  like I love it, you know.

I guess you have to go 2 feet, right?

Could happen.

Boy, that didn't -- that didn't break at all.

I hit that so good, that didn't break at all. Hey, partner, that broke a lot less than we thought, huh?

Why don't you figure a foot?

A little deceiving.

I got to tell you, come here, come here.

You are too much.

Fantastic.

So, now we need --

Now, we need one more.

That's US Open stuff, right? That's it right there. That's what you have to do for US Open. Are you very impressed with tour players? I mean, are they like --

Amazing?

You know whose game I like, Patrick Reed. He just looks like a golfing machine, right?

And, you know --

I don't know, to me he's just --

He's a solid guy.

And he's tough, nasty, right?

And he's a great chipper right here.

One of the best chippers, yeah.

Say hello to all those guys.

Every one of them.

All right, so now, we're nice and safe, partner. Now, you can go for it.

Is he in the bunker?

We like that bunker shot.

Unless you want a fairway shot because I have a good fairway shot.

It could be what we did in that other hole.

But let's see. I don't mind bunker shots. I like bunker shots.

You play the shot that you can get down the best.

So, this is pretty easy.

Let's go -- yeah, let's do that.

I think that's the mark, isn't it?

I think that's your mark right there. See it?

Check right behind it.

Look, I know that's it --

I'm pretty sure that's your mark.

They tend to go in.

Let's go hit it.

Yup. You have a wedge.

How far is that, Neville?

40?

All right, let me -- is that what you like? How's the wind?

Well, that's right next to it.

What was it, a wedge? A wedge?

That was beautiful.

I think the problem is it was moving pretty good.

I have a feeling we're not going to be as happy. Yeah, this.

Doesn't that look easier?

Yeah.

So, it has to -- you have to break 50, you can't just get to 50. But we'll do it again.

We'll do it again.
