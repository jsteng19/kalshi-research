Well, you do the best you can. I have a judge who's taken away my First Amendment rights. I'm not allowed to speak, essentially. If you say anything slightly off, he wants to put you in jail. He's a partisan, biased judge, a terrible judge who's totally conflicted. He shouldn't be a judge.

Probably so. I would like to. I mean, I think so.

Peaceful protests are fine, but these aren't peaceful. These are very, very much the opposite of peaceful when you look at what's happening, and they're all over the place. There's a tremendous upheaval taking place in our country. And it's a shame. And we have a president, he can't speak. He -- he just doesn't make any statements.

Nobody knows where he stands.

Well, the most important thing is always going to be will they be a good president because if something should happen, you know, it's such an important -- it's such an important position. But if something should happen to me, we -- when something happens to me, which can happen, you have to make sure that somebody really good is in there to take your place.

So, that's always got to be the No. 1 criteria. And number two is helping to get elected, getting some votes. Traditionally, however, and you know this probably better than I do, VPs have never really helped in the election process.

I like her a lot. So, you know, I don't want to comment on anybody on the list, but she had a rough couple of days, I will say that.
