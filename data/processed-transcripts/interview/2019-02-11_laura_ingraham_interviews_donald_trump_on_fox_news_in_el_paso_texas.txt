Well, I can tell you that a lot of things have changed and we'll see what happens. I can't go into the exact deal. I just heard it very quickly coming over to see you. It was between the -- the deal and you and I had to choose you because I had no choice. Right? And I'm very happy I did. But, yes, they're talking and we'll see what happens.

Well to that I say, number one very few people showed up to his rally and this place is packed with thousands and thousands outside and I guess he challenged us to an event. So maybe this means he's going to have to drop out of the race because this was not a good situation for him. I don't know why he did it and it has nothing to do with anything other than safety for the Americans, safety for our people, safety for our country and a wall is a very good thing not a bad thing.

It's a moral thing to put it in the opposite terms and we have tremendous support. We're building it right now. We don't even say build the wall anymore. We say finish the wall because we've built a lot and we're renovating a tremendous amount of old stuff that was really in bad shape but it had good structure.

So we're saying finish the wall. No, walls are very important. If you don't have it, all the technology Laura, all of the drones that they have flying around so nicely up in the air, they don't mean a thing.

Well first of all, Juarez is like the murders are tremendous and here they're very few. They are not correct. They know they're not correct.

Their crime was -- was very high and then the wall got built and, you know, really you should talk about the sheriffs that agree with me which are like 98 percent of the sheriffs in the country maybe all of them.

Well when you do that and the Democrats came up with that because that means that you don't detain people that are very dangerous. That means you have to put them out into our society because our laws are so bad. And if you look at what happened and what's been passed over the years in Congress, it's a shame.

It's a disgrace. That means we can't just put them back into Mexico or where they came. We have to put them back into our society. In some cases they're stone cold criminals. We can't do that.

Yes.

Well I think they're, number one, they're young. They're idealistic if you call it idealistic. I think that capitalism is more of an ideal. But if you look at the poll numbers, you look at the kind of numbers that we have it's been great. I hit my all time high today, 52 percent and that's with only bad strories because the press only gives me bad stories.

You treat me fairly.

No.

Because that's where they're coming from. When I see some of the responses, when I see some of the statements made by Congressmen and women I -- I say am -- are we living in the United States of America. Look, we have a country that's doing the best it's ever done. We are just lapping the world, you compare, you know, it used to be like we were a second sister to China.

Now China's looking up to us. We are doing so well and other countries are not doing well and that makes it tougher for us in a certain way because we do business with other countries. But we're setting records in so many ways including record unemployment meaning in a positive way. Meaning --

If I would have stayed with what President Obama did, you look at his last month. You look at what happened the first months coming into my term they were very low, the numbers, the GDP and everything else. If I would have stayed with those numbers Laura, we would have had an economy that would have been going way in reverse right now.

We opened it up. We got rid of regulations that were unnecessary. We did the biggest tax cuts we've ever done in our country. We opened up the oil. We opened -- you know we're the largest oil exporter now. We're the largest oil and gas in the world right now. Nobody thought that was possible this quickly.

No, we opened up our country. We're letting people work again. We have more people working today, almost 160 million people, we have more people working today than have ever worked in the United States. It's great.

Well --

Yes.

What's happening to me --

Yes. What's happened to me should never be allowed to happen to another president. With investigations on things that never took place, like Russia. You know, the Russia collusion, delusion we call it. I call it a hoax and in fact it was very nice Richard Burr came out after almost two years of investigation.

They found absolutely no collusion between Trump and the Russia which I could have told a lot of people and which I have been saying to a lot of people. This has never happened to -- it's -- the Democrats know it's a hoax. This is a political game. So now the Russia thing is dead and now they say, well we're going to look at every company that Donald Trump was ever -- they don't have any information on anything.

We're going to look at every company that Donald Trump was ever involved in. I did great. I made a lot of money. Now they want to go back and investigate every company. We want to go -- and we have, I think 79 different letters from different committees --

Well for the most part they've conflicted. I got one from --

-- I got one from Pocahontas today where it said that Donald Trump, we want to investigate some company that -- it's so disgraceful. I said, just write her back and say she's got a conflict of interest. OK? And she should focus more on her heritage and not being ashamed of what she is. She should really focus on herself.

But we've gotten letters Laura from so many committees.

I didn't know we had so many committees. I think it's up to 79 letters. This is based on no information of any wrongdoing because I'm a very straight person.

So we went through this whole Russian hoax, nobody's ever done what I did where I was hit with this. Now, think of this. Hit with it and we probably had the greatest first two years of any president in our history in terms of what we've accomplished with employment, with GDP, with everything. And companies are moving back into our country which is one of the great steps.

Yes. Terrible situation. I think that the Republicans are going to do very well in Virginia. I think a lot of things are happening in Virginia. I didn't campaign in Virginia because I was said -- I was told that a Republican can't --

Virtually not but, yeah I started looking at numbers I said why aren't I there? But -- but I didn't, you know, they -- they sort of assumed that's a Democrat state and as you know I did very well there without having gone. I think Virginia's ready to flip over to something. I tell you African-Americans are coming to the Republican party like nobody can believe.

A lot of things are happening, a lot of very positive things.

Well I watched his news conference, it was pretty sad. It was a sad -- look, let them figure out what to do. But I -- I felt actually -- I felt sorry for his wife and his wife saved him from doing, as you know, Michael Jackson. He was going to try and imitate Michael Jackson with the moonwalk. Nobody can imitate Michael with the moonwalk and this would not have been a pretty -- you add that little couple of seconds of footage onto what he did.

But it was -- it was a pretty bad situation.

Thank you very much.

Thank you very much. Appreciate it.
