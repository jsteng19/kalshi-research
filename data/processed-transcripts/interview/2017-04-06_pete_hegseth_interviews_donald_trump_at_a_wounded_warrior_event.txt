It's a Great honor.

Well, it's very special, these are very special people. And I wanted to be here. And, as you know we have big meetings today with China, and others, but this was a very special, really a very special point in the day for me. You look back here, you look at the enthusiasm, these are incredible people.

Well, I love them, and we wouldn't be here if it weren't for them, and I said we're going to take care of them. You know, they have not been taken care of properly, and it was a big, a big thing, and David, who, as you know, is the new Secretary, is going to do a fantastic job. And he has a group of people with him, the enthusiasm's incredible, and you see it already. I mean, the results already have been incredible.

He wants to get good people, that I can tell you. He wants to get good people. More so than firing, he wants to bring in great people. And it's time, it's time, because the VA has not done so well. But we have the best people in the world. We're going to take care of them.

Well, it's going to be interesting. Nobody really knows. We have not been treated fairly on trade for many, many years. No president's taken care of that the way they should have, and we have a big problem with North Korea. We're going to see what happens.

Well, we're going to see what happens, Pete. But I will to tell you, we'll be in there pitching, and I think we're going to do very well.

Well, I thought it was a terrible thing. When you see little babies that are dead from gas, and a very, very heinous form of gas, which very few people have access to, it's bad stuff. That's bad stuff. Really bad.

Thank you. Well, we love Fox and Friends. Thank you very much.
