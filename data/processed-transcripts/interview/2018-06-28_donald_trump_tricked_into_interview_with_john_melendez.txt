Hi Bob.

How are you? Congratulations on everything. We're proud of you. Congratulations, great job. You went through a tough, tough situation and not I think a very fair situation. But congratulations.

Well Bob, let me just tell you, I want to be able to take care of the situation every bit as much as anybody else. At the top level, I'd like to do the larger solution rather than the smaller solution. You know... they're doing it step-by-step. I think we can do the whole thing.

I have a good relationship with the party. You have a good relationship with the party, and I think we can do a real immigration bill. We have to have security at the border. We have to have it. I mean, look, you have... 60% of the country says we have to have security at the border. And that's because  you Bob. It's not like it's good for you or good for me. It's good for both of us.  you know, of the problem.

I agree. I agree. So Bob, here's what... let me do this. I'm on Air Force One. I'm just coming back from an amazing rally in North Dakota actually.

, you know it's a tough, it's a tough road. Say it again.

Well, I haven't looked... I mean I have a list of people. I have a big list of people Bob, and we'll take a look at it, and we're going to make a decision, I'll probably make it over the next couple of weeks.

Yeah. Well we will talk to you about it. We're gonna probably make a decision, Bob, over the next two weeks. We'll have, I think we're gonna have... we have some really great choices, and be done over the next 12 to 14 days.

You take care. I will speak to you soon, Bob. Take care of yourself.

Thank you Bob. I'll talk to you soon. Bye.
