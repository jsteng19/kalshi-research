Eric is fantastic, by the way.

Eric is -- is he with you now?

-- Fantastic. You, your whole show and your whole deal is great. So just keep it up. We're making a lot of progress, actually.

Well, only that we won the election. We won it by a lot. You saw the big dumps they had in the middle of the night and all the things.

If you go back to 10:00 in the evening on November 3rd, that was the win. And then all of a sudden, just miraculously these numbers started pouring in. This is the greatest scam in the history of our country, probably even beyond their spying on my campaign. Not, not probably, even beyond.

Incredible.

Let me tell you. So, I'll give you just a little example. The Supreme Court ruling you had the other day on churches, you're allowed to go to church, actually.

That was all because of me. That was my three people voted.

Voted.

Um, if we don't, if we don't win this thing in every -- We're never going to be able to bring our country back. We'll never be able to bring it back. And just to finish, there's more spirit now, Eric, than I think they had at any time that I've ever seen it. People are angry. They're angry in Georgia and they're really angry in Pennsylvania, but they happen to love Doug.

Doug is the hero. And your group that they came, they came up to the office, but Doug is the absolute hero. So Eric, we'll get together. I think you do a fantastic job and keep it going. Just keep it going.

Yep, they stole an election, but we're not going to -- We're just not going to let it happen.

Thank you, Eric. We're fighting hard. I just want you to know that. We're fighting very hard. Keep it going. I'll talk to you later.
