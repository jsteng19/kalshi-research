While we're there, and we have the right to do it, and we have plenty of time, actually, and would like to do it before the election, and I think we'd have a great success. I'll probably put in the nominee on Saturday, Friday or Saturday. Uh, we're looking at five different people, women, in all cases, in this case, and I think we're gonna have somebody who's great, really great.

Yes.

That's right.

Well, there's a very good chance. We're looking at it very strongly, and I happen to, I happen to love this state. You know that, and we've done very well. Uh, I think we have a really, uh, good chance. Space Force is developing rapidly. It's -- I think it's gonna go down as one of the more important things we've done.

You know, it's the sixth branch of the military. So, uh, we'll be informing probably pretty soon. I guess they're looking to make that decision fairly soon. I'll be involved in it.

Right.

And by the way, they were great police officers. They, They were so professional. That was the way it should be done. They really were incredible people. Say hello if you see 'em. But say hello. Well, we're about law and order. These are all Democrat red areas that, that red areas are, are -- If you look, the red areas are all 100%, the Republican areas.

The blue areas, the Democrats, whether it's Portland or Chicago or New York or so many other pl -- Oakland, Baltimore, they're a, a crime mess, what's going on. And we've offered to help. We will help. We'll send in the National Guard, or we'll send in whatever we have to do. But all of these Democrat-run areas are a disaster, and the Republican -- If you take a look, I guess, top 10, top 25, it's all Democrat.

The Republican cities are doing very well, law and order-wise and also economically.

Thank you very much. Great honor.

Say hello to those officers. Will you do that? Okay.
