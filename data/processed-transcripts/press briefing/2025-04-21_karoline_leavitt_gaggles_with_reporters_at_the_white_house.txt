Hi Connie.

Good to see you all at the Easter Egg roll.

No travel plans at this time. Doesn't mean it's not happening. I just don't have anything to share. But the President, of course, is aware of the passing of the Pope, and did put out a statement this -- this morning, and we're praying for the millions of -- of Christians around the world who love the Pope and admired him this morning.

The President absolutely has confidence in Secretary Hegseth I spoke to him about it this morning, and he stands firmly behind him.
