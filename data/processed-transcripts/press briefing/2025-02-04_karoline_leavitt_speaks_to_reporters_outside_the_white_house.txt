Hey, Elena, how are you?

Yes, sure.

OK.

I have not heard that report nor have I been made aware if the president has seen that or not, but I can check. And as for Mr. Witkoff, I think you'll be hearing from him out here today. We're going to try to make him available to talk to the press.

I don't have any updates on when that call will take place. As you heard from the president yesterday, it is being scheduled and will happen very soon. But the president made it very clear with the 10 percent tariff on China that he is not going to allow China to continue to source and distribute deadly fentanyl into our country.

That was the reason for this tariff. It was a retaliatory tariff on China for the last four years of their unprecedented distribution of fentanyl into our nation's borders. So, when that call happens, we will provide a readout like we always do.

Well, I think you'll hear more from both President Trump and the prime minister later this afternoon. And I think the fact that this is the first working visit from a foreign leader here at the White House shows that President Trump will continue to stand strongly with Israel. And he is wholeheartedly committed to ensuring all of the hostages return home and standing with our Israeli allies.

Thank you, guys.

Yes.

I feel great.  a very popular slogan  country. And there's tens of millions of Americans who are hopeful that RFK Jr will be the next HHS secretary and we expect all Senate Republicans to stand tough and strong and vote for him.
