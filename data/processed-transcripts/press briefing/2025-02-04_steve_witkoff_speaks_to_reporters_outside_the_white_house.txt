OK, hello everybody. Good afternoon. As you know, Prime Minister Netanyahu is on his way to the white House. He will be here shortly and so, we wanted to make available to you today the Special Envoy to President Trump for the Middle East, who has done a lot of great work on this front, obviously, Steve Witkoff and, of course, our National Security advisor, Mike Waltz.

We just ask that you keep the questions to the topic of the day, foreign policy and the ongoing situation in Israel and Gaza. I make myself available, as you know, to answer questions on other subjects going on in this building. So, please be respectful of their time and they're happy to answer your questions.

Let's act like adults here. They are generously offering their time to answer your questions. You don't need to scream at them like a bunch of schoolchildren. Weijia, go ahead.

Go ahead.

You guys will hear from the president directly later this afternoon, so we'll see you there.
