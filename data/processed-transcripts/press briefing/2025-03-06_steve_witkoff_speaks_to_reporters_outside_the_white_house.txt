How are we?

I brought the great Mr. Witkoff out here today. Obviously there's a lot of foreign policy news. The president put out a very strong statement to Hamas directly last night. And Mr. Witkoff brought the hostages to the white -- the White House, to the Oval Office yesterday. The president met with them and Mr. Witkoff did as well.

So, I wanted to give Steve an opportunity to take some of your questions. Obviously, we ask you reserve questions about nonforeign policy topics for him. That's his wheelhouse. Um, and we'll let you guys take some questions, but I think he has some words to share with you as well.

One more. Jackie? Last question, go ahead.

Thank you, guys. Thank you.

Mr. Witkoff has been very generous with his time today. I know everybody's very interested. We have to go inside.

Thank you.
