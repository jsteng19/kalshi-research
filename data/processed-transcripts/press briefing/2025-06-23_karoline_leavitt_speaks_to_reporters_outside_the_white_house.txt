The president's posture and our military posture has not changed. The president was just simply raising a question that I think many people around the world are asking. If the Iranian regime refuses to give up their nuclear program or engage in talks -- we just took out their nuclear program on Saturday night, as you all know.

But if they refuse to engage in diplomacy moving forward, why shouldn't the Iranian people rise up against this brutal terrorist regime? That's a question the president raised last night. But as far as our military posture, it hasn't changed.

Uh, he has made his message to Iran quite clear.

I'm not going to get ahead of the president. I just explained his trip to you last night.

The secretary of Defense said yesterday, there has been both public and private messages sent to the Iranians since the very successful operation on Saturday night and that remains the truth.

I can assure you the administration is actively and closely monitoring the situation in the Strait of Hormuz. And the Iranian regime would be foolish to make that decision.
