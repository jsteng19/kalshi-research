Thank you to Melania for the incredible job she's done. We really appreciate you being here. This certainly was an unusual year. We won an election, but they don't like that, and a lot of things happened, including a rigged election, and I know , and whether people like to hear it or not, that's what it was.

But we won the election. We did a great job, everybody did a really great job, and you look at the economy today, and you look at what's happening and you look at the vaccine that are coming, and they're coming rapidly.

Nobody's ever -- I will say, it's been said by many, a medical miracle. They would have had it out five, six years before they got a vaccine, and we did it in a year. . Fantastic.

But it's been an amazing four years. We're trying for another four years, otherwise I'll see you in four years.
