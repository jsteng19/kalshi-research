Hello everybody.

Hello, Doug. Hello, everybody.

How are you? We had a big day in Pittsburgh. Uh, $92 billion, but it's gonna be closer to $100 billion is gonna be invested by the biggest financial people in the world where we had everybody there from Larry Fink to everybody else you could imagine. And it was a really great day, and a very productive day.

Uh, I think we're over now, as a country, we're over $15 trillion of investment and there's never been anything like that. In the history of our country, there has not been anything like it --

-- or even close. So, uh, okay, do you have any questions?

We're working on probably five or six. Of the five or six, I'm not sure I really wanna do them, you know. You want somebody that knows how to negotiate, but, uh, we'll probably have two or three. You know, we insist on opening up the country, which is a big deal. Uh, Indonesia was great. He's a great president.

Uh, we made a, a terrific deal where they opened up the entire country to trade with the United States. We weren't allowed to go in and trade. Uh, I think something similar will happen with i- with, I would say India, and we have a couple of others. But I, I have to tell you, for the most part, I'm very happy with the letters, you know.

The letters are a deal, you know. I, I can't explain it any better. The letters are a deal. The press doesn't wanna pick that up, but I will veer from those deals on occasion when somebody is willing. Like if Japan would open up their country, they don't do that. They just don't do that. And I don't either, uh, I don't subscribe to it one way or the other, but they won't do that.

So, we might just stick with a letter. But South Korea is inclined to maybe do that, so we'll, we'll let you know, but we have letters out. Every time I send out a letter, essentially that's a deal.

Right.

You know, payments, payments start on August 1st.

The only thing about that's really sacred about August 1st is that's when payments start. So, they have to start paying billions of dollars to you and people. Are you a citizen of the country?

All right, good. You'll be very happy 'cause you're gonna be getting a lot of money. Just like they found a budget surplus, we have a budget surplus of $25 billion. Everyone said, "How did that happen? It hasn't happened in many years." It happened because of good management and tariffs.

Well, I, I might. I don't think it matters how much you release of the deal. Uh, we have a Vietnam deal.

And I would say that that deal is being pretty well set --

-- pretty well set. Again, that's an opening of their country. They've opened it up. Just so you know, these were closed countries. They were wonderful people, wonderful leaders, very strong, smart leaders, but their countries were closed to us, but our country wasn't closed to them. And so, I said, "You gotta open up your country." So, we're gonna see.

But the Vietnam deal, we may open it. I mean, I don't know. I can't tell you. Is it necessary?

Yeah, I don't think so.

I don't think it's, I don't think it's a long time. I think really the question should be asked, why did Biden get us into that ridiculous war? Why did Biden bring us there? That should never, ever have happened that war. This is Biden's war. I'm just trying to end it --

-- because we're saving a lot of lives.

A lot of opinions change very rapidly. Might not be 50 days, might be much sooner than 50 days.

They're gonna, uh, they're already being shipped.

They're coming in from Germany, and then replaced by Germany. And in all cases, the United States gets paid back in full.

So, what, what's happening is, you know, is the European Union, if you look, mostly European Union stuff, but let's put it in, in the form of NATO.

It's very similar, but NATO is gonna pay us back for everything. In some cases, we're gonna be paid back by countries of the European Union directly.

But we're always getting our money back in full, so we're not gonna have any more investment to make. We're getting our money back in full. And if we can make a deal, that'd be great. We're saving 5 or 6,000 soldiers a week. They're Russian and they're Ukrainian soldiers. They're not American soldiers. And we won't have boots on the ground, but, uh, it's a shame, 5,000. Last week they say 7,100 soldiers, both Russian and Ukraine were killed.

Well, they wanna talk. I'm in no rush to talk. Uh, they would like to talk. I'm in no rush to talk because we obliterated their site. They'd have to start all over. In fact, it's so obliterated to the point that it's not usable anymore. They'd have to pick a different mountain.

That mountain is so blown up inside and so unstable that they would have to pick a different mountain.

Ours, our people really did the job. Yes, please.

Well, he spent two and a half million dollars building this place. I- I have to say this, I think he's terrible. I think he's a total stiff. But the one thing I didn't see him is a guy that needed a palace to live in. You talk to the guy, it's like talking to a nothing. It's like talking to a chair. No personality, no high intelligence, no nothing.

But the one thing I would've never guessed is that he would be spending two and a half billion dollars to build a little extension onto the Fed.

Nobody's ever seen that. I think it sort of is because if you look at his testimony to the House, to the Senate, you take a look at the testimony, it's under  That whole thing is, and he's not, you know, he's not talking about the problem. It's a big problem. Two and a half billion and that's two and a half billion now.

That's gonna be a lot more money than two and a half billion to expand and with all of that to house thousands of people to give him information. And yet, out of the 71 economists, and they included me, me and one other person got it right. I got it right. And one other genius got it right. They had everybody else was wrong, 69 were wrong, and two were right.

I was one of them. And I don't have a lot of people. I have our -- I have, uh, Doug, I have a few people. He has thousands of people and he got it wrong. No, I think when you spend two and a half billion dollars on really a renovation, I think it's pretty disgraceful.

No, I have not.

Yeah, he does.

He says he wants peace. He does. No  all talk and no act.

But you know, if you think about it, India, Pakistan, we did so many. The Congo, and I mean look at- look at the deals we've made. We made all these peace deals. Look at Rwanda, it was an impossible deal to make with the Congo. I made that. I made all of these deals, Serbia, Kosovo, and here's the one deal and actually Vladimir called me up. He said, "I'd love to help you with respect to making a deal with a couple of them." Like Iran. "I'd love to help you." I say, "Vladimir, I only wanna help with one deal, Russia, because you're the only deal that we're not doing too well on." He oftentimes, oftentimes he said, no, he wants peace.

And I think he does. I hope he does. We're gonna find out soon. And it could be before the 50 days.

She's very smart. She's very neutral. She's very neutral in a sense. She's sort of like me. She'd like to see people stop dying. You know, people said, "Are you for one side or another?" I'm for the side of people stopping dying. We have 5,000, 6,000 and 7,000 people a week at least and that doesn't include people from the cities and towns that are having rockets lobbed in there.

I mean, people are dying in the cities and towns too. But we're talking about 7,100 in the last eight days died. And I'm for- I'm for stopping that

Well, he is an option.

Well, he is not because I like the job he is doing. That's why he's not --

I like the job. I don't know if he was on the plane. Was he on the plane?  Maybe he wasn't, but I do like the job he's done.

So in that sense, probably he's not that much of an option.

Scott's been great. He's been terrific. He did a good job today. He's a very soothing part -- you know? It's soothing. All right.

The pharmaceuticals will be tariffed probably at the end of the month. And we're gonna start off with a low tariff and give the pharmaceutical company a year or so to build. And then we're gonna make it a very high tariff because -- We gotta move 'em and look, there's two ways you do it. You make money and- or- and/or you have them move here so they don't have to pay the tariff.

Those are the two ways. The pharmaceutical companies are moving back to America where they should be.

Uh, similar, uh, actually less complicated, but similar, semiconductors and chip.

I don't understand --

I don't understand it. Uh, why they would be so interested in -- He's dead for a long time. Uh, he was never a big factor in terms of life. Uh, I don't understand what the interest or what the fascination is. I really don't. And the credible information's been given. Don't forget, we went through years of the Mueller witch hunt and all of the different things.

The Steele dossier, which was all fake, all that information was fake. But I don't understand why the Jeffrey Epstein case would be of interest to anybody. It's pretty boring stuff. It's sordid, but it's boring. And I don't understand why it keeps going. Uh, I, I think well, really, only pretty bad people, including fake news, wanna keep something like, like that going.

But credible information, let 'em give it. Anything that's credible. I would say let them have it.

No.

What's interesting, because we need jobs. We need a lot of people to work. You know, we're building, we're gonna be building very shortly hundreds of factories, including AI. We're building a lot of car factories. They're all coming in from other countries now in order to avoid paying the tariffs. And we need people working.

So if AI can help us with that, that's a positive. 'Cause we're not gonna have enough workers to take care of it if we don't create something. So whether it's robots or whether it's AI, we need somebody to take care of. Do you agree with that?

What do you  That, what would you say --

-- about this job?

We need people. We really need, 'cause we're building so many factories in the country. And so AI can help with that. But what also is gonna help are gonna be robots. You know, the robots I think are gonna be a big deal and that's gonna help also.

Yeah.

I don't think so. I think that whole thing is gonna go away eventually. It should have gone away. And Putin does say, "Oh, I want peace. I want peace," but so far he hasn't lived up to that. So I think it's gonna go away. But we're gonna find out soon. We're gonna find out soon.

No, I don't wanna do that. But they're very biting, they're very significant and they're gonna be very bad for the countries involved. I mean, they'll be very, very powerful and, uh, very bad for the countries involved. And I hope we don't have to pull that string and maybe we won't. We'll see. Gotta end.

Gotta stop the killing.

No. You know, the interesting thing is that 12 votes were votes where they wanted it to be stronger in terms of crypto people. I figured. Oh, wow. That's sort of interesting. 'cause I was focused really on today's meeting, not that, but the interesting is the votes, so negative votes were because they wanted it to be, and the safeguards, they wanted it to be stronger for people with Bitcoin or crypto.

They wanted more strength, which is interest.

We have, uh, a little bit discussed, but the deal is really very well done. But I'll meet with the Prime Minister, we have a good relationship, and I think it's gonna be, uh -- And it'll be very shortly, and it'll be probably in Aberdeen, Scotland.

Yeah.

Say it again.

Well, there's about four of 'em. I'll let you figure that one out. (laughs) But we have about four of them. Uh, in three cases it's one, and in, uh, one case it's two or three.

And Texas would be five.

Well, we'll fight them. You know, they're so corrupt in California, (laughs) you never know what's gonna happen. But we've done pretty well in the courts in California, as you see. Uh, we're batting about a thousand, ultimately. We start off a little slow (laughs) and then we get a lot of hits.

No, I think they would like to make deals more than me. I'm satisfied with --

But they would like to make deals more than me.

I'm not saying i- they're wrong, I'll put it nice. I in my opinion, he and Scott, and maybe even Doug to a certain extent. You're more like me, (laughs) I think. But --

But, they would like to make deals more than me. I'm very happy with the deals the way they are.

Those are very -- Right? Those are very simple deals that -- Whatever the percentage is. And we base that in a lot of things, including the deficit and, you know, various things. And we, you know, I think it's a much faster way. Don't forget --

-- we'll be releasing a letter soon, talking about many countries that are much smaller, where you're not gonna do letters per se. You might do an individual letter, but it's gonna go very quickly. And the number will also be less.

These are countries that are, uh, many of them, you know, like 200 countries.

You understand --

We'll, we'll, probably set one tariff for all of them.

Uh, um, probably a little over 10%, yeah.

We don't do a lot of business, but we do, you know, it's still significant.

No, I think Israel's gonna be, uh -- Israel's gonna be fine. We had a great victory with Israel. That was a great, great victory. What we did with, uh, the B-2 bombers and all of that. And, you know, I never thought of it, but so many people are thanking me. They say, "No president had the guts to do it." Because, you know, this has been going on for 25 years.

In fact, when the pilots came to the Oval Office, they said, "Sir, we and our predecessors have been working on this attack for 25 years." Uh, have a good time everybody.

Thank you.
