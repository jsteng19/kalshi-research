We're going to a bodega. But you know about that, right? Thank you very much. I just want to say that --

I just want to thank you very much, and we are going to continue our fight against this judge. We think he's totally conflicted. He's a conflicted judge. As you know, we're in an appeal --

There's never been a judge more conflicted than this one, so we'll see how that all works out.

We're having a hard time -- we're having a hard time with the New York State system. It's under watch by the whole world, and it's not looking very good. So, we think we have a very conflicted, highly conflicted judge who shouldn't be on the case. And he's rushing this trial, and he's doing as much as he can for the Democrats.

This is a Biden-inspired witch hunt. And it should end, and it should end very quickly. Thank you very much.
