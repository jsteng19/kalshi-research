It has been a great honor. The honor of a lifetime. The greatest people in the world, the greatest home in the world, they call it a home. We've had an amazing four years. We've accomplished a lot.

We love the American people and again, it has been something very special, and I just want to say goodbye, but hopefully it's not a long-term goodbye.

We'll see each other again. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you.
