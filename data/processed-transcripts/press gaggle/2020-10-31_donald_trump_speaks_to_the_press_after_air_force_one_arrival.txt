This is the great coach. Lou Holtz, a friend of mine, and it's so nice to be here. I wasn't even sure if he'd be here. He's getting the Presidential Medal of Freedom. He's a very inspiring guy, and people love him. Lou Holtz.

So we're going over and I'll see you in a little while. I hope -- are you enjoying it? You are. I don't know about them, but you are. Thank you. Thank you everybody.  And we're doing well -- I hear we're doing great in Florida, doing great in Ohio.

Doing really well in Georgia, doing really well in Texas, and I think we're doing terrific in North Carolina. I hear --  now, these aren't polls. These are what's happening. But I think we're doing very well. I'll see you over there.

We think Iowa's doing really great. Really good. I'm going tomorrow but it's doing really well.
