You know Governor Ducey -- a very successful governor.  He's loved by the people of a very great state -- a state that we're doing very well in, I hear.  And maybe, Doug, you would like to say a few words?

Well, you know, Doug, did a great job in Arizona, where the number went high quickly, and then you just, boom, you went down. You were tough. He was strong, and he did the right thing, and the numbers went down.

We had a big victory just now in Pennsylvania. I don't know if you heard about it. They were ordered to open it up -- a federal judge -- open it up and let the people get back to work. And that's what you've done. And you've done a great job.

Thank you very much.

And we're going to see you over at the --

-- the Spanish -- the Spanish heritage, really, I guess, is what the name is. There's nothing better.

We just had some great polls with Hispanic -- with the Hispanic vote. And I'm very honored by it. We were very honored by those polls.

So we'll see you over there. Thank you.

We are working with your governor. He's a great governor. And we're, I think, doing a really good job for Hispanics, the Latinos. We're doing a fantastic job. And I think it really is represented very well in the polling numbers that we're getting, because they haven't really seen numbers like that for a long time. So we're very, very honored by it. Thank you.
