Since we're here, I just wanted to let you know that the recruitment numbers are getting to be records â€” they're at levels that we haven't seen in many, many years.

For the Army, the Navy, Air Force, the Marines, the whole thing, the recruitment numbers you're probably hearing, they're at record.

So, we're really happy about that. Thank you. Thank you.
