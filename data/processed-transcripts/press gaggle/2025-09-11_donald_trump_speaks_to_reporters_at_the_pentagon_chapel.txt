I can't believe Charlie. What a great guy he was.

Uh, yeah, I have it set for this afternoon.

A wonderful woman, too.

Well, we're going to be talking about it very soon.

We will -- we will be discussing it. You don't replace a Charlie Kirk. He was unique, as you all know. You know as well as I do. He was a unique man. But, uh, we'll do the best we can.

No, they've -- they've reported to me so far. Pretty much what you're seeing in the news is what it is. They have a virtual manhunt out there, so, we'll see what happens. We hope they get him. Thank you

Thank you.
