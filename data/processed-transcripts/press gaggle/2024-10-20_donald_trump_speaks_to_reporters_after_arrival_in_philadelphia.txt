And he'll call me on occasion. I haven't called him. No.

He did. He told me that he was attacked, and his village where he lives, a vacation area, and he was attacked. But he was fine.

Well, we'll see what happens. He was asking -- he was asking what I thought. And I just said you do what you have to do. So, I said you do what you have to do.

I think she is going to be. She's supported me. And you know, we had a great primary. It was an unbelievable primary. I did -- it was the fastest anyone's ever gone and it was by the most votes that anyone's ever had. And she wanted to join me. And I said absolutely, I'd love to have -- I want everybody's support.

Well, you know, it's interesting. When I was at the Catholic dinner, the Al Smith dinner the other night, it was very interesting. People from Lebanon came to see me, very religious people. And they said, "Please tell Israel not to stop." I was surprised. These were people that lived in Lebanon. They have had a lot of problems with the people that were being killed.

So, I thought it would be the opposite, "Please tell them to stop." They said, "Please let them continue." They actually -- these are people that lived in Lebanon, very important people. So, look, here's the story. Ready? I'm going for a job right now at McDonald's. I've had -- I really wanted to do this all my life.

And now, I'm going to do it because she didn't do it.

Thank you very much. I'll see you at McDonald's.
