Well, we have a big night. I think it'll be very interesting. I assume most of you will be there for the official swearing-in of Judge Kavanaugh. And I think it will be something very, very special.

I've always been told it's the biggest thing a President can do, and I can understand that. So it will be very special.

We just had a very nice talk. We actually get along. And -- a really good talk.

Yeah, I'm not doing anything. I'm good. So I'm not -- I don't want to do anything about that. I think we'll be treated very fairly. Everybody understands there was no collusion. There's no Russia. It was all made up by the Democrats. They're the ones that colluded with Russia. The Democrats colluded with Russia. And, frankly, the previous administration didn't do anything about Russia when they knew that they should have.

Yeah.

You got to speak up. Look.

I said that I was going -- I'm not making any changes. You'd be the first to know. I'm not making any changes, though.

I am concerned about it. I don't like hearing about it. And hopefully that will sort itself out. Right now, nobody knows anything about it, but there are some pretty bad stories going around. I do not like it.

Thank you. I'll see you at 7 o'clock.

And what did she say?

You know, well, Marsha Blackburn is doing a very good job in Tennessee. She's leading now substantially, which she should. She's a tremendous woman. I'm sure Taylor Swift has nothing -- or doesn't know anything about her. And let's say that I like Taylor's music about 25 percent less now. Okay? Thank you.
