Thank you very much, everybody. Appreciate it. I want to start by wishing my wife, Melania, a very happy birthday. It'd be nice to be with her, but I'm at a courthouse for a rigged trial. It's a rigged trial. Terrible. But we're doing very well in this rigged trial, and everybody knows it. Yesterday was a big day, but I do have to begin by wishing Melania happy birthday.

She's in Florida. I'll be going there this evening after this case finishes up, this horrible, unconstitutional case, when it finishes up. We have a report that was just put out by House Judiciary on the district attorney's office. This was done by Congress. And so, I guess it just came out a little while ago, a few moments ago.

I have to say that, yet, I haven't read it, but it should be interesting. I think yesterday went very well in this courthouse. It was -- it should be over. The case is over. You heard what was said, and that the case should be over. But you'll have to make that determination. I think we have a judge that will never allow this case to be over in a positive way.

It's highly conflicted. The most highly conflicted judge I've ever seen. And yesterday, I think the Supreme Court, having to do with immunity, I heard the argument was brilliant. I listened to it last night. I thought it was really great. I thought the judge's questions were great. And all presidents have to have immunity.

This has nothing to do with me. Absolutely nothing. All presidents have to have immunity. You don't have a president, certainly not a president that the founders wanted. So, we have another day of court in a freezing courthouse. It's very cold in there for -- on purpose, I believe. They don't seem to be able to get the temperature up. It shouldn't be that complicated.

But we have a freezing courthouse, and that's fine. That's just fine. And let them keep handing it out. It is a rigged trial. Thank you very much, everybody.
