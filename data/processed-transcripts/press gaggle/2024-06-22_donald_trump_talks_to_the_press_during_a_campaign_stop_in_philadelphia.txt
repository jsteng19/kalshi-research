How are you?

Oh, I love that.

I love that. Thank you.

You'll be happy today. Being here -- being here is prepping. Thank you again. Thank you, everybody. Thank you, man.

Thank you, man.

Hello, everybody. How are the ladies, handsome dude? How are you?

This guy

You got it.

If we don't have it, we don't have a country.

Thank you.

Your place is going to do good.

It's going to do good.

You take me where I'm supposed to go. We're going to get sandwiches for everyone, right?

That's great. That's great.

Most likely, yeah. You'll be there. Yeah. I think we have a lot of people coming. There's a lot of interest, tremendous interest in the debate. And, you know, when you say prep, I think this is prepping. These people know better than anybody what they want, right?

In my mind, yeah.

No, nobody knows.

Who do you like as VP?

Who do you like?

You like J.D.

Who do you like?

Who?

That's interesting. Who do you guys like as VP?

A lot of -- there's a lot of variance.

I think Biden has been the worst president in the history of our country.

I think Biden is the worst president in the history of our country. I think he's destroying our country.

I don't know. I don't know. All I can tell you, he struggles with being president, right? He's a terrible president. That's where he struggles.

I don't care about the debate. I don't care if he struggles at the debate. You know where he struggles? At being president, right?

Pretty soon. Not too -- not too

Stick around. I'll buy you a sandwich.

Thank you very much.

Who is with this guy?

Yeah, we did. We won big.

I think so. There's even more of a feeling this because they see how bad he is.

Go ahead, darling.

You got to get a sandwich. I'm buying everybody a sandwich.

OK. Thank you, man. Thank you. You look good.

Yeah, go ahead.

OK. Let's go. Ready? Give me the receipt and I'll sign.

Give me a pen. Ready?

Who do you like?

Oh, Mark Robinson. He's doing good. He's got his own race out.

He's fantastic.

That's a -- that's an interesting one.

Ready? No tax --

On tip.

Look at this. Now, if you think it's all right.

No tax on tips.

Who are you with?

You're so friendly, though. NBC News. You're too friendly to be with NBC. You're really -- you're good reporters.

Because NBC doesn't have too many.

I will tell you very soon. You may be first to know. No, you're so nice to be with NBC. I can't believe it.

This. If I can handle guys like this, they're easy. OK?

Right around the convention. Maybe a little before, but could be at the convention. But we'll have some great people. We have some great people. Who do you like as VP? Go ahead.

Let me have that outside.

Brian is good. Brian is good.

Who is he? Let me see.

Oh, that's nice.

Let me have it. Wow. Who did this picture?

That's a good picture.

Who did it?

A starving artist in the  mall.

He's -- this starving artist is better than the artists that aren't starving. Look at this. No, he's good.

I see artists that get paid a lot of money like Hunter. Hunter.

Do you think Hunter could do this painting? I don't think so. What do you think? TikTok --

This man is with TikTok. We love TikTok. I'm going to save TikTok. Biden wants to get rid of TikTok. You know why?

Because he has no idea. He has no idea what the hell he's doing. I'm going to sign this for your friend, all right?

That's a beauty.

Who?

No, I'm not concerned. I did nothing wrong.

See, now, we made it valuable.

I give it -- give it -- give it to his -- give it to him.

So --

Yeah, we did absolutely nothing wrong. This -- this country is corrupt. And what they're doing with the weaponization, they're going to be ashamed of themselves.

No, I'm not worried at all. I'm not worried at all. You know what, it doesn't bother me. Nothing bothers me. We have a corrupt group of people. And you know what?

And it's really working out the other way. We just got the highest poll numbers we've ever had.

Rasmussen -- Rasmussen just gave us -- we have a 10-point lead, 10 points. But you know what?

They cheat so much that 10 points isn't enough. We have to get more. Because if we don't win, our country is finished. I'm telling you. OK. That's going to be good. I want to leave a tip for you guys.

I'll leave a tip.

How much did I leave them? How much of a tip?

Let me see here.

He wouldn't have had to add it up. OK. Are you ready?

I'm going to give you 500 bucks. You guys all split it up. Is that OK?

Well, you split that up.

Thank you all very much. This is a great crowd. Hello back there. How are you? I saw you from the car. I notice those things.

Yeah. Go ahead. Let's go. Shoot.

The strategy is to make America great again. My strategy is very simple, make America great again. That's all. Because our country is going to hell.

And we're going to turn it around fast. There's no strategy. We're going to turn it around fast. And I look forward to Thursday. I know he's locked up in a log cabin someplace. You can imagine what he's doing.

I like this group of people.

These are my people. These are good. Let me tell you, these people built America. You know that? These people built America.

You know what, Biden should have been a better president. He wouldn't be in this position. He's the worst president in the history of our country. Biden should have been a better president. He's let this country go to hell. We've become a third-world nation. We're a nation in total distress. And we got to turn this country around, and we're going to turn it around fast.

And we're going to drill, baby, drill, right?

Drill, baby drill. Get your energy prices down.

You know, it all started with energy when you think about it.

Where's your baseball? It's OK.

I trust him. It's all right.

I'll throw it at him. He won't

I'll do fine.

Well, we had a great debate four years ago. We had two of them. They were both good. But I think -- you know, I think what happened is the country has gone to hell. In the last three and a half years, the country has gone down badly, and he's got to explain why is he allowing 18 million people in here, many from prisons, many from jails, many from mental institutions, insane asylum.

Why has he done that?

Why? No, he's somebody that hates our country. I don't -- honestly, I don't think he knows what he is.

He's not -- he's not calling the shots. Other people.

Say it.

Well, he certainly can't run a country. He's done a horrible job. We're a laugh -- this country is a laughingstock all over the world, and these people know it better than anybody.

Thank you all very much. Thank you.

Give me that book.

Come on, give me that book. Pass that book.

Yeah. Give me your bag. Make sure you don't have a bomb. Do you have a bomb in it? It's all right. I trust her. If it blows up, you're going first.

That's a nice bag.

Let's go. Do you have a camera? Where's your camera? Come on, take it. Come on over here. Is this -- oh, this is the boss.

I took good care of your people.

Hey, listen, take care of these people, OK? Let's go. Go ahead. Take a picture. You got to get one.

Who's the owner? Right there.

He makes good money. You're an associate. That's  Let's go.

Come on. Everybody know Margot? Margot is famous. Let's go.

OK. Let's get -- let's get -- you pass it on. Go ahead.

Make sure he gets one.

Do another one. He --

He's going to put it -- oh, is that yours? Let me see what it looks like.

Oh, that's a nice one.

Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. Let's go fast.

Oh, that's great.

Let me have that.

Have a good time. Whose book?

You know what? They don't want me to go back.

Can you bring it here? Bring them up here. So, they have a --

They got to have a police scanner. Come here. You've been fantastic. I'm going to have your sandwich later. If I don't like it, I'll call you, OK?

Thank you, everybody. Thank you back there.

Hey, good to see you. Oh, she's so beautiful.

Yeah.

Watch your -- watch on Thursday night.

Watch on Thursday night.

This guy. OK. What a good-looking guy. He's good with it over there.

Oh, what a night. Come on over here. Come over here. Oh, he's a sweetheart. Look at that. He's -- he's --

You know what?

You like Trump, don't you, huh? Do you have some good pictures of me?

Come on, NBC, take -- even NBC has to be -- right? You can't do better than this kid. That's beautiful.

You take care, OK? We love you, man. All right? Hold on. Hold on. I got to give him some. Make sure he gets a special sandwich for himself. Yeah, I'm going to do something. Come here. You're going to hit pay dirt. You know why?

Look at him, huh?

You know that is?

We got to add some -- we're going to add some value, OK?

Look at this guy now. Come here. OK.

We just added a little value. OK. We love this kid. I like that kid.

So, if your parents don't want to, I'll take you. He's a good boy. Have a good time, everybody.

Is that kid --

I think he's great. Thank you. That's OK.

So, you're going to take care of our friends over here. Thank you, all. Thank you.

He's going to get a tattoo tonight.

That's good.

Hey, that's great.

November 5th or sooner, get out and vote.

We can't lose this thing. We lose this

We lose it, we're all getting out of here. Yeah, yeah.

You'll be OK.

You'll be happy.

Thank you. Nice to see you. You're doing a great job. That's all right. Come on over.

You've done a good job covering the riots and everything. Really good. No, really.

Well, this is really the best strategy right here. We have all these people screaming questions, and I look forward to the debate. We just did Faith and Freedom, as you know, in D.C. And now, we're here for a big rally, about 10 minutes away at the Temple Arena. And we have it packed. We have lines that are going a mile long.

And it's an honor. And you've done a very good job. I've been watching. She's done a very good job.

I hope you get a pay increase now, right?

It's no game plan. It's just there's a lot of love. You know, they want hope. There's no hope with this guy, Biden. He's the worst president we've ever had. There's no hope. And I say it all the time now. I started like a week ago. I didn't even realize it. I'm saying, the people need hope. I go out, I see the greatest people.

So, we're in the middle of a pretty rough area and it's a love fest. You see that. It's incredible. They want hope. They want to have --

They want to have a future. Listen to this.

And these are not people that would normally be -- going  It's been amazing.

Well, I could be in a lot of other places, but I choose to be here, and the rally is phenomenal. It's going to be, you know, an hour or something. I think it starts at 7 o'clock, and it's being carried on Fox. Come to think of it.

And by the way, Tammy Bruce is fantastic, and she's the one that's sort of semi-responsible. So, say hello to everybody.

Well, if you knew that, you would probably be up for a major pay. We have a lot of -- you know, she says, "Who do you like? Who do you like?" And there were so many different answers. We have a lot of good ones. I'll be announcing it right around the time of the convention.

Well, we're getting -- we're actually two points up in Virginia. Virginia is not a state that a Republican generally wins, hasn't won it for decades. And we -- you know, we're leading in Virginia. We're leading in Minnesota. That one hasn't been won since 1972. And we have a very good chance of -- I think we're going to win a lot of places that people never even thought about because our country is in a dire shape, to put it mildly.

It's doing badly. I say we're a country -- we're really a country that is -- we're a failing nation. If you look at our country, we are now a failing nation, and that should never happen. We're going to turn it around fast. I look forward to the debate, but the debate is not the big deal. The big deal is what have you done?

And we had four great years and he's had three and a half years of destruction of our country.

Well, I think if he prepares, he'll be fine, and then he'll forget it within about an hour after preparing. So, we'll see what happens. We'll see what happens.

We wish him well.

Have a good day. Thank you.

I love -- no tax on tips. By the way, no tax on tips.
