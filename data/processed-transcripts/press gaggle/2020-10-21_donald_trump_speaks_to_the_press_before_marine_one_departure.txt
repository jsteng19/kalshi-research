Hello, everybody. So we're going to North Carolina. Big crowd. Really big crowd. And we're going to have a good time.

We're doing very well in the polls. I guess you noticed it's going up rapidly, and we look forward to it.

The who?

Well, I think the mute is very unfair, and I think it's very bad that they're not talking about foreign affairs. They're supposed to be talking about foreign affairs. And I think that the anchor is a very biased person. Her parents are very biased. But that's my life.

In the meantime, that's the White House standing behind me. Right?

Yeah, I do prep. I do prep.

Thank you very much, everybody.
