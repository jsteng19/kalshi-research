So, thank you very much. We just heard that we have a great Secretary of Defense. We're very happy about that, and we appreciate everybody's vote. And very importantly, I think we had two fantastic meetings in North Carolina and also in Los Angeles, and we made a lot of progress. It's â€“ they're tragic events, really tragic.

And we appreciate your being here, and we're going home.

No, no, we just had a good talk. We're on the same team. We want to get it fixed. So, we had a very good talk. With the governor, I had a very, very good talk.

I didn't know that. I just know we won. I didn't know that.

I hope the mayor got the message. Yeah. I don't know.  I'm not sure, but I hope so. Now, look, I think she means well, but these people want to get about building their house. They're not going to wait around 18 months, and they're not going to wait around a long time.

So, we're going to give an immediate permit.

No. No, I'm honored to have Pete. I think Pete is going to be a great Secretary of Defense -- Pete Hegseth -- and we're honored to have him.

No, I did speak to Pete -- yeah -- in the plane, in the helicopter. I think Pete is going to be a great Secretary of Defense.

No, I didn't even know that. No, I don't know that. I just heard that we won. Winning is what matters, right? So, thank you very much everybody. Are you going on the plane?

Good. Maybe I'll see you on the plane.

We'll see you on the plane.

I will.
