No, not much. It was a very secure vote, much more secure than when you send in a ballot, I can tell you that. Everything was perfect, very strict, right by the rules. When you send in your ballot, it could never be like that. It could never be secure like that. They've done a fantastic job over here. Great people inside.

So, uh, but it's an honor to be voting. It's an honor to be in this great area, which I know so well, and we're going to make three stops today. Big ones, big rallies. Three big ones. Uh -- crowds have never been -- I don't think there's ever been anything like this, this tremendous spirit. I hear we're doing very well in Florida, and we're doing very well, I hear, every every place else.

So thank you very much, and you're going to be very busy today, because we're going to work you hard.

Today, I voted for a guy named Trump. Thank you very much everybody.
