We have thousands of people lined up, so we wanted to make this stop.  It would be very unfair. You have thousands of people who started coming last night, so we're going to do that and, we got a lot of happy people. In the meantime, we have it very well covered in Florida, from the White House, from here, from what's on the plane, and we'll be back very shortly. But it would have been very very unfair to thousands of people who we'll see over there. How are you?

Nice to see you. So I'll see you over at the place. You all going over there?

No, I think the Fed is, making a mistake. They are so tight. I think the Fed has gone crazy. So you could say that, well, that's a lot of safety. Well, that is a lot of safety, and it gives you a lot of margin. But I think the Fed has gone crazy. Okay?

No, I think it's good. Actually, it's a correction that we've been waiting for for a long time. But I really disagree with what the Fed is doing. Okay?

Who?

Well, she's certainly being considered. She's done a great job. She was with us, as you know, for a long time. Been with me from the beginning. She's certainly excellent, but she's one of four or five . It'll be good. Nikki did a great job. We have four or five really great candidates. I'll see you all, are you going over?
