I think Jim will be the speaker of the House. He's a fantastic young man. He's pretty young still, and he's very strong, very -- he has very proper opinions about our country. He loves our country. He wants to see it do well. And I think he's going to be confirmed sometime soon. As you know, many people have now supported him when 24 hours ago, they were supporting somebody else.

There seems to be great unification. I think Jim Jordan will be a great speaker. I think he'll be -- I think he's going to have the votes soon. If not today, over the next day or two. And I think he'll end up being a great speaker.

I think everything he does is political. And unfortunately, everything he does doesn't work out very well. Thank you very much.
