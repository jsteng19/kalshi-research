It's such an honor for our country. It's such a great honor for our country to have an American pope. I mean, what greater honor could there be? That we were a little bit surprised, very happy. But just a great, absolutely great honor.

Say it again.

So we'll do others. We're working on three of them right now, trade agreements. We're doing three and we just left Tiger. You saw Tiger, who's fantastic, great champion, great guy. But we'll be doing a lot of the signings. They would like to do them in the Oval Office.

What is that?

Well, we're changing all of that, but we have it both ways. We have it both ways.

We'll have somebody great. We'll have somebody great. I really thought he was terrific, but we are doing so many different things right now that we couldn't be really focused on -- he's a wonderful guy. He's going to have a great future, maybe with us.

What's next?

I do. Yes. They've already called.

They've already called.

They have already spoken to us and we'll see what happens. But again, to have the Pope from the United States of America, that's a great honor. That's a great honor.  they said -- I'm watching and they said, he's from America. I said, that's great.

I don't think so, but we're having very good conversations, very, very good. Thank you, everybody.
