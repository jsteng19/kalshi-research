So we're doing very well. I guess the poll numbers are looking very, very good in many of the states, and once people hear what we've done, and it's all clarified, I think they have to go with us. We're in a great state right now, and we look forward to doing something that's going to be exciting. The crowd is very big.

All of the crowds have been incredible, and they've been incredible. Size too. I don't think there's, uh, anybody that's covered that properly, because the kind of size that we have, I don't think has ever been done before, and the enthusiasm that we have,  I don't think anybody's ever had more enthusiasm. So, it's a real honor. We will see you in a little while. I assume you're all going, and we'll see you over in Carson City

Yeah, we're talking about it. I think Nancy Pelosi, maybe, she's coming along. We'll find out. We want to do it. I want to do it at a bigger number than she wants. That doesn't mean all the Republicans agree with me, but I think they will in the end.

If she would go along, I think they would too on stimulus. So, uh, let's see what happens. Thank you very much. See you over there.
