Well, thank you very much. The stock market is doing very well. The economy is doing very well. I think we're going to have some tremendous numbers over the next number of months. A lot of things are happening.

I just had a meeting on vaccines and therapeutics, and it was a great meeting. We had a lot of our wonderful doctors and researchers with me. I think the meeting went really well. We're doing well on vaccines. We're doing well on therapeutics. And now I'm heading to North Carolina to look exactly at that.

No, I haven't seen him lately. I heard he --

No, I won't be going. No.

I can't hear you. Go ahead.

We have a great thing happening with lowering of the drug prices. The drug prices in our country will be coming down very substantially. I was given that right because of the DACA decision. The DACA decision allowed me to do things that some people thought the President didn't have the right to do. I was given that right. Drug prices will be coming down very, very substantially. No other President has been allowed to do that. No other President has been able to do that. No President has ever done what I've done for prescription drug prices -- and, by the way, for many other things too.

Thank you.
