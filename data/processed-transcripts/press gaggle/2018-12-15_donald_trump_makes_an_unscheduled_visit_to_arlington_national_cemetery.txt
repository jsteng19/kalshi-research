We're looking to expand Arlington National Cemetery by acquiring land around it, and it's working out pretty well. We're working very hard on it. We'll get it done. They need it.

They need it.

Well, it was a big ruling. It's a great ruling for our country. We'll be able to get great healthcare. We'll sit down with the Democrats if the Supreme Court upholds. We'll be sitting down with the Democrats and we'll get great healthcare for our people. Let's say repeal and replace, handled a little bit differently.

But it was a big, big victory by a highly-respected judge, highly, highly respected in Texas, and on the assumption that the Supreme Court upholds, we will get great, great healthcare for our people. We'll have to sit down with the Democrats to do it, but I'm sure they want to do it also. Thank you very much.
