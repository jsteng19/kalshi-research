Yeah, this is off the record.

Well, we have both -- you know, both candidates are coming.

I've always said I'd love to be able to do that deal. They say that's the hardest of all deals. I love doing deals.

Well, that would be maybe harder.  Because I always say -- I mean, it's -- you guys cover it well. They say peace between Israel and the Palestinians is the toughest -- the toughest of any deal. In fact, if you're in business, and you're doing just a business deal that's impossible, you say, "Israel and the Palestinians would be easier" -- you know, meaning it's the toughest deal.

So we have both candidates coming. That's unheard of.

You know, what really got in our way is the election has taken forever. You know, there was somebody supposed to win the election, and it was essentially tied, and then tied again, and then tied -- you know, that's where they are right now. So we've been sitting, waiting for a candidate. But both candidates want to do it. So, they're both coming.

On the Middle East? Fairly soon. But they'll be coming -- what -- what's the date? When are they coming? The --

Twenty-eighth? Yeah. Sometime prior to that.

I think so. We're going to probably release it a little bit prior to them coming.

It's a great plan. Honestly, it's a great plan. It's a plan that really would work.

We've spoken to them briefly. But we will speak to them in a period of time. And they have a lot of incentive to do it. I'm sure they maybe will act negatively at first, but it's actually very positive for them. But they have a lot of incentive to do it.   It'd be a great thing to do, on a humanitarian basis.

I mean, the whole thing is crazy -- and for so many years. And so we're going to give it a good shot. We have both of them coming in. I was surprised. I was impressed. But both came off the campaign trail. They had been campaigning for a long time. This is their third election, right?

So they've been campaigning for a long time. And they both would like to do the deal. They want to see peace. Look, Israel wants peace. The Palestinians want peace. They all want peace. Not everybody wants to say it though, you know? It's a little bit -- it's difficult for people to say, politically.

But they all want peace. So anyway, so I'll see you in a little while.

Yeah. I think so. Sure.

The Middle East stuff, yeah.
