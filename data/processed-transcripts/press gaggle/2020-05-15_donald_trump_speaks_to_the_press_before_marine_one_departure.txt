So we'll be going to Camp David. We have a lot of meetings scheduled. I think they'll be very successful meetings. We're getting a lot of gear out. We're getting a lot of gowns out -- protective equipment. And the governors have all been very thankful. We received a lot of calls today from governors. They're very thankful for the job we're doing. And that's good.

Do you have any questions? Please.

Go ahead.

So we have a lot of discussions going on at Camp David, some military and some other than military. We'll probably report back on it on Monday.

I just don't want to talk to him right now. We'll -- we'll see what happens over the next little while. They're buying a lot of our material. They're spending a lot on the trade deal, but the trade deal -- I don't know, somehow I lost a little flavor for it. You can understand. Go ahead.

We're sending a lot of ventilators to India. I spoke to Prime Minister Modi, and we're sending quite a few ventilators to India. We have a tremendous supply of ventilators . So --

Go ahead. Go ahead.

Say it?

I haven't seen it.

You'll have to -- you'll have to tell me.

Yeah, go ahead.

We're looking at that, actually. But we're making a lot of progress on vaccines. But we'll be speaking to you very soon, and I think we're going to have a very good couple of meetings at Camp David.

Thank you.
