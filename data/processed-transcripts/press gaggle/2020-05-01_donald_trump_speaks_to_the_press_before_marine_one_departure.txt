Hi everybody.

So I'll be going to Camp David for a working weekend. We're going to be spending a lot of time with meetings and phone calls and some foreign leaders. So we look forward to that, and we'll be back very soon. I guess we're doing something pretty big on Sunday night at the Lincoln Memorial. That'll be very nice.

But we'll be back soon and I think some of you will be traveling out around the area where I'm going. But we'll be at Camp David for a working weekend.

Yeah, I rather not comment on it yet -- Kim Jong Un. We'll have something to say about it at the appropriate time.

I think he's doing a very good job. He's a great friend of mine. And the President is doing really well in Brazil. We're very proud of him.

Well, they have -- they've been hit hard. Brazil has been hit very hard. But you have a President that's doing a very good job.

I don't want to talk about it.

I may.

So we're going to see what happens. A lot of things are happening with respect to China. We're not happy, obviously, with what happened. This is a bad situation. All over the world -- 182 countries. But we'll be having a lot to say about that. We -- it's certainly an option. It's certainly an option, John.

It's certainly an option.

Yeah, I will.

I didn't say that, John. I said I didn't like the particular place -- a spa, a tattoo parlor.

No, no, I think it's wonderful. I want to see us open safely, but I didn't like spas and tattoo parlors, and I wasn't thrilled about that. But I did -- I said nothing about Georgia, other than that.

I like the states opening. They will be opening. They're going to open safely and quickly, I hope, because we have to get our country back. Thank you. Thank you.
