I'll button up here. Hello everyone.

We just had a great flight. Our fantastic ambassador, we appreciate the job he's doing. He's doing --

-- really well. Really well. The relationships are great. And he's been outstanding. So I want to thank him for welcoming us. We had a good flight. A lot of people came with us, and tomorrow is going to be a very big day, Mr. Ambassador.

Well, I love it. I love Turnberry. I love Aberdeen. I have a lot of -- a lot of things here that, uh, they warm my heart. I want to tell you. They're very special. Great.

Well, uh, we're going to see him tomorrow, and he's been a friend of mine for a long time, and everybody respects him. And they love him. Thank you very much.
