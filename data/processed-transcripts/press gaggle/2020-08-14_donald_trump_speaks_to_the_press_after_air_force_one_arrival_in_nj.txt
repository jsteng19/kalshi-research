So, I'm going to New York now. I'm going into Manhattan, into the -- a certain area that's a little bit private, to put it mildly. And we'll see you there. I don't know who's going, but we'll see you there. We'll then be coming out here.

We're being honored by the police, by New York City's Finest, tonight. And they'll be doing an endorsement, so we're very honored by that. And we will see you probably later. Do you have any questions?

Well, that's where I'm going. I'll be going to the hospital, so I'll see my brother.

I hope he's okay. He has a tough time. He's having a tough time.

What about it?

We're doing very well on our trade deal, but I feel differently about China than I've ever felt. I'll see you later.
