No, I think that James Comey was [unfair to the people of this country. I think what he did was a disgrace. I think he goes down as the worst FBI Director in history, by far. There's nobody close. And I think I did the country a tremendous favor by firing him.

No, I think -- actually, if you take a look, when he totally exonerated her -- because I call it "Comey Three." You had one, two, and then you had Comey three. He totally exonerated her. And if anything he's saying is correct, what she did is they tried to pretend it didn't happen. I would have gone out there and I would have had the greatest news conference in history. They tried to pretend the exoneration didn't happen.

Now, the exoneration was incorrect because there's no way they could have checked that number of emails in just a few days. But if you remember, just before the election, he went out and he exonerated her and they didn't even talk about it. That was the greatest political mistake.

With all of that being said, I won Wisconsin, I won Michigan, I won states that a Republican hasn't won in many, many decades, years. She didn't do a good job and you never gave me credit for doing a great job. But the fact is, I did a great job.

Well, I hope that's not so. And I know they're getting documents. And I purposely -- look, if you see what I've done with North Korea and with the State Department, Mike Pompeo, it's running so well. It's -- I have this running so well. I have purposefully, because of this ridiculous witch hunt, I have said I'm going to stay away from the Justice Department until it's completed. So I wanted to stay away. Now, that doesn't mean I have to, because I don't have to. I can get involved. But I don't want you people to say that I'm interfering, that I'm doing anything.

I think that the report yesterday, maybe more importantly than anything, it totally exonerates me. There was no collusion. There was no obstruction. And if you read the report, you'll see that. What you'll really --

Excuse me. Wait, wait, wait. What you'll really see is you'll see bias against me and millions and tens of millions of my followers. That is really a disgrace. And yet, if you go -- and yet, if you look at the FBI, and you went in and you called the FBI -- the real FBI -- those guys love me, and I love them.

No, but I think that whole investigation now is -- look, the problem with the Mueller investigation is everybody has got massive conflicts. You have Weissmann who was at Hillary Clinton's funeral, meaning, her party that turned into a funeral. And they were screaming and crying and they were going crazy. How can you have people like this? So you have -- I call them the "13 Angry Democrats." You have a tremendous animosity.

Now, here's the good news: I did nothing wrong. There was no collusion. There was no obstruction. The IG report yesterday went a long way to show that. And I think that the Mueller investigation has been totally discredited.

Yeah.

You know why? Because I don't want to see a nuclear weapon destroy you or your family. I don't want to see --

Excuse me. Because I don't want to see a nuclear weapon destroy you and your family. I want to have a good relationship with North Korea. I want to have a good relationship with many other countries. And what I've done, if you remember, if you're fair, which most of you aren't -- but if you're fair, when I came in, people thought we were probably going to war with North Korea. If we did --

Quiet. Quiet. Quiet. If we did, millions of people would have been killed. I don't mean like -- you know, people are saying 100,000. Seoul has 28 million people 30 miles off the border. You would have had 30, 40, 50 million people killed. Who knows what would have happened?

I came in; that was what I inherited. I should have never inherited. That should have been solved long before I got there. I did a great job this week. The fake news said, "Oh, you met." But the only thing they saw that I gave up -- one broadcast said, "He gave up so much." You know what I gave up? I met. I met.

We had great chemistry. He gave us a lot. You haven't had a missile test in seven months. You haven't had a firing. You haven't had a nuclear test in eight and a half months. You haven't had missiles flying over Japan. He gave us the remains of our great heroes. I have had so many people begging me -- parents, and fathers, mothers, daughters, sons -- wherever I went, "Could you please get the remains of my boy back?" They're giving them back. Nobody thought that was possible.

Wait, wait. They're doing so much. And now we're well on our way to denuclearization. And the agreement says there will be total denuclearization. Nobody wants to report that. So the only thing I did was I met. I got along with him great. He is great. We have a great chemistry together. That's a good thing, not a bad thing.

I can't speak to that. I can only speak to the fact that we signed an incredible agreement. It's great. And it's going to be great for them, too. Because now North Korea can develop and North Korea can become a great country economically. It can become whatever they want. But there won't be nuclear weapons and they won't be aimed at you and your families.

That was my offer. Just so you understand. Military --

Okay, you want to hear?

Okay? Military -- I call them "war games." I hated them from the day I came in. I said, why aren't we being reimbursed?

That's my term.

They might use it. We pay for it. We pay millions and millions of dollars for planes, and all of this. It's my term. I said, I'd like to halt it because it's bad to be negotiating and doing it. It costs us a lot of money. I saved lot of money. That's a good thing for us. Okay, go ahead.

I'm kidding. You don't understand sarcasm. Who are you with? Wait, wait, who are you with? Who are you with?

You're with CNN! Hey, you are the worst.

Wait, wait, we have time.

Well, I feel badly about a lot of them, because I think a lot of it is very unfair. I mean, I look at some of them where they go back 12 years. Like Manafort has nothing to do with our campaign. But I feel so -- I tell you, I feel a little badly about it. They went back 12 years to get things that he did 12 years ago?

You know, Paul Manafort worked for me for a very short period of time. He worked for Ronald Reagan. He worked for Bob Dole. He worked for John McCain, or his firm did. He worked for many other Republicans. He worked for me, what, for 49 days or something? A very short period of time.

I feel badly for some people, because they've gone back 12 years to find things about somebody, and I don't think it's right. I don't think it's right that they burst into a lawyer's office on a weekend and early in the morning. I never heard of that before. I mean, could you imagine if they burst into Barack Obama's lawyer's office? It would not be acceptable. It would not be acceptable. I mean, that's really a terrible thing.

Now, I feel badly for a lot of those people. I feel badly for General Flynn. He's lost his house. He's lost his life. And some people say he lied, and some people say he didn't lie. I mean, really, it turned out maybe he didn't lie. So how can you do that? How can you do that -- because who has lied more than Comey? I mean, Comey lied a tremendous amount.

I don't want to talk about that. No, I don't want to talk about that. They'll . But look, I do want to see people treated fairly. That's what it's all about.

I mentioned the other day -- you saw what I did with the woman -- she's in jail for 23 years on charges where other people are out after three months. I thought it was a very unfair. It was brought to -- and she had another 20 years left, okay? She was 63 years old.

What?

Well, I'm looking at them too, if you don't mind. I'm looking at them too.

One second.

Look, I did nothing wrong. You have to understand, this stuff would have come out a long time ago. I did nothing wrong. I don't do anything wrong.

It's really nice.

I always liked Michael Cohen. I haven't spoken to Michael in a long time.

No, he's not my lawyer anymore. But I always liked Michael, and he's a good person. And I think he's been --

Excuse me, do you mind if I talk?

You're asking me a question; I'm trying to ask it.

No, I'm not worried because I did nothing wrong.

Nothing wrong.

Let's not talk about it. You know what that is?

It's irrelevant. It's a statement to the New York Times -- the phony, failing New York Times.

Just wait a minute. Wait a minute. That's not a statement to a high tribunal of judges.

That's a statement to the phony New York Times. In fact, frankly, he shouldn't even speak to the New York Times because they only write phony stories anyway, although yesterday they wrote a nice story about what a .

Look, if you read the IG report, I've been totally exonerated. As far as I'm concerned --

Take a little at it. Take -- no, take a look at the investigation. Take a look at how it started. Take a look at the horrible statements that Peter Strzok, the chief investigator, said. And take a look at what he did with Hillary Clinton. Take a look at --

I'll tell you what -- you're asking me about Peter Strzok being fired. I am amazed that Peter Strzok is still at the FBI, and so is everybody else that read that report. And I'm not even talking about the report; I'm talking about long before the report. Peter Strzok should have been fired a long time ago, and others should have been fired.

I'm looking at Scott, and Scott has done a fantastic job at EPA, but -- you know, we'll -- we'll make --

I'm not happy about certain things, I'll be honest.

Excuse me. Excuse me. I'm not happy about certain things. But he's done a fantastic job running the EPA, which is very overriding. But I am not happy about it.

I hope not.

No, I hate it. I hate the children being taken away. The Democrats have to change their law. That's their law. They will force --

Quiet. Quiet. That's the Democrats' law. We can change it tonight. We can change it right now. I will leave here --

I will leave here -- no, no. You need their votes. You need their votes. The Democrats, all they have to do --

Excuse me. By one vote? We don't need it. You need 60 votes.

Excuse me. We have the one vote -- excuse me. We need a one-vote -- we have a one-vote edge. We need 60. So we need 10 votes. We can't get them from the Democrats.

Now, wait. Wait. You can't do it through an executive order.

Can we do one question at a time? Wait. One question at a time.

The children can be taken care of quickly, beautifully, and immediately. The Democrats forced that law upon our nation. I hate it. I hate to see separation of parents and children. The Democrats can come to us as they actually are -- in all fairness, we are talking to them -- and they can change the whole border security.

We need a wall. We need border security. We got to get rid of catch-and-release. You catch a criminal, you take his name, you release him, and he never shows up again. He goes into our society, and then we end up getting him in a different way, oftentimes after he's killed somebody. We've got to change our laws. The Democrats have control because we don't have the votes. The Republicans need -- we need more Republicans, frankly. And that's why I think we're going to do so well in the midterms. That and because --

Wait. That and because we have the strongest economy in the history of our nation. We have the best jobs numbers in the last 44 years. Top of Drudge: "The best job numbers in 44 years."

Because he's following the law.

No.

No. He's following laws. He following a law that --

Can I answer your question, please?

Okay? You're just asking me the same question over and over. He's following laws, very simply, that were given to us and forced upon us by the Democrats.

The Democrats gave us the laws. Now, I want the laws to be beautiful, humane, but strong. I don't want bad people coming in. I don't want drugs coming in. And we can solve that problem in one meeting. Tell the Democrats, your friends, to call me.

Well, I'm going to speak to people in North Korea, and I'm going to speak to my people who are over in North Korea. A lot of things are happening.

And I will tell you this: We now have a very good relationship with North Korea. When I came into this job, it looked like war -- not because of me, but because -- if you remember the sit-down with Barack Obama, I think you will admit this, he said the biggest problem that the United States has, and by far the most dangerous problem -- and he said to me -- that we've ever had, because of nuclear, is North Korea.

Now, that was shortly before I entered office. I have solved that problem. Now, we're getting it memorialized and all, but that problem is largely solved, and part of the reason is we signed, number one, a very good document. But you know what? More importantly than the document -- more importantly than the document, I have a good relationship with Kim Jong Un. That's a very important thing.

Donald Trump

People are shocked that this is the kind of -- you know, they thought Trump was going to get in and he was going to start throwing bombs all over the place. It's actually the opposite.

But we're building a military so strong -- $716 billion next year; $700  this year. We're building a military so strong, nobody is going to mess with us. But you know what? I never want to have to use it.

Quiet.

We're going to have a very strong verification process.

Now, if you read the agreement, which most of you didn't, point after point after point he gave, including getting back our -- the remains of our great heroes, okay? Of our great, great heroes. Which made -- some people are crying in the streets they're so happy. Nobody thought we were going to get that. Point after point.

All they said about me is, "You met. He met. It's terrible you met." Of course I met. Meeting is a good thing, not a bad thing. By the way, it was good for the United States; it was good for them.

I spoke with China. They are very happy. Actually, they were much happier. Now, they may not be as happy today because of what I'm doing with trade. You probably heard that. I assume it's been announced by now. But we're putting tariffs on 50 billion dollars' worth of technology and other things because we have to, because we've been treated very unfairly.

But China has been terrific. President Xi has been terrific. President Moon, everybody -- we're all working together because of me.

Well, we're working it as fast as possible.

We're working it as fast as possible.

We're working that. We're working denuclearization as fast as possible.

It's possible that we'll meet, yeah. And I thought -- you know, this all started because somebody -- one of you -- asked, "Should Putin be in the G7?" I said, no, he should be in the G8.

A few years ago, Putin was in what was called the G8. I think it's better to have Russia in than to have Russia out, because just like North Korea, just like somebody else, it's much better if we get along with them than if we don't. So it's possible. Just so you understand --

No, no. President Obama lost Crimea, just so you understand. This was long before I got there. Just -- I want to make it so the fake news prints it properly. President Obama lost Crimea.

Wait, wait. That's his fault. Yeah, yeah, it's his fault. Yeah, it's his fault.

The President -- just so you understand --

Because -- because Putin didn't respect President Obama. President Obama lost Crimea because President Putin didn't respect President Obama, didn't respect our country, and didn't respect Ukraine.

But President Obama, not Trump -- when it's my fault, I'll tell you. But President Obama gave away that. Now, President Obama, by not going across the red line in the sand that he drew -- I went across it with the 59 missile hits.

But President Obama, when he didn't go across the red line, what he gave away, nobody even knows. But just to put it -- one more time, President Obama gave away Crimea. That should have never happened. Goodbye everybody.
