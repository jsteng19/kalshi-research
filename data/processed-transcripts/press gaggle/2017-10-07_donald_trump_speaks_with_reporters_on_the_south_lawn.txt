We're going to block grant back to the states. But if we made a temporary dea,l I think would be a great thing for people. But it's really up to them. Obamacare is a disaster. The numbers are out. It's exploding like I said it would.

So basically, if we could do a one-year deal or a two-year deal as a temporary measure, you'll have block granting ultimately to the states, which is what the Republicans want, that really is a repeal and replace.

He's a military man, but he loves doing this -- which is chief of staff -- more than anything he's ever done. He's doing a great job. He will be here, in my opinion, for the entire seven remaining years.

No, no. He likes me like Secretary Tillerson. So do I. We have a very good relationship. We disagree in a couple of things. Sometimes I'd like him to be a little bit tougher, but other than that we have a very good relationship.

Well, he says they were inappropriate.

That's locker room. That's locker room. Yeah, go ahead.

Well, we're gonna see what happens. We're gonna see what happens. So now I am going to the really great state, a state that I love, of North Carolina, and I'll see you later Go home and rest. What?
