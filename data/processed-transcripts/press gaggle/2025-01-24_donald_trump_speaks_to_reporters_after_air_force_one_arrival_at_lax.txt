Hello, everybody. So, we just left North Carolina a little while ago. We have that in very good shape. We have the congressman in charge and Michael Whatley, and we're going to do a lot of work. We have the -- the Army Corps of Engineers working, as they are here, and I think you're going to see some very big progress.

They left them high and dry. And now, we're going to be taking a little tour with some of the people from the area. I appreciate the governor coming out and meeting me, Gavin, very much. And we'll be talking a little bit. We want to get it fixed. We want to get the problem fixed. And there'll be some ways, but it's like you got hit by a bomb, right?

Like you got hit by a bomb. Would you like to say something?

Yeah.

Very well. We got to get it done. Tremendous numbers of lives have been affected. A lot of real estate has been affected. Nobody's ever probably seen anything like this.

You could almost say since the Second World War. What do you think of it? I mean --

Nothing like this has happened. And we're going to get it fixed, and we'll get it permanently fixed so it can't happen again.

And again, we'll be talking a little bit later, and we'll get it worked out, OK?

Thank you, Gavin.

Thank you.

We got to get it finished. We're looking to get something completed, and the way you get it completed is to work together. He's the governor of this state. And we're going to get it completed. They're going to need a lot of federal help. Unless you don't need any, which would be OK.

So, we're going to take care of things, OK?

OK? Thank you, folks. Thank you. I guess some of you are coming with us and some of you not. Thank you very much. Thank you. I'll see you --
