So we have a big event. We have three of them today, but this will be a group of people that we know very well from this area. Amazing -- amazing attendance and amazing poll numbers. We have poll numbers that I'll be talking about up there that have been very extraordinary.

I don't know. I think we are leading in Pennsylvania. I think we'll win Pennsylvania, so I don't have to worry about that.

I think we're going to win Pennsylvania by more than we did last time.

I don't understand you.

I'm not -- go ahead.

No, no. He has. He's waved the white flag on life. He doesn't leave his basement. This guy doesn't leave his basement. He is -- he's a pathetic candidate, I will tell you that.

What's happening to Europe is -- nobody's seen anything like it, and you used to be all about Europe. Now, we're doing a great job. We are absolutely rounding the corner, other than the fake news wants to scare everybody.

We are absolutely rounding the corner. Go ahead.

Yeah. We're going to see probably at the White House later on this evening, see how it all works out. The vote is taking place, and we'll see how that works out.

No, not a large event, just a very nice event.

Say it?

It's holding. The cease fire is holding. Okay? We'll see you over at the event.

Was I offered?

No, but we'll have the vaccines very soon. The vaccines are in full development. And we're going to have 'em very soon.

We don't have them yet. They haven't been approved yet.  But they're going to be -- they're going to be approved very soon. Thank you. The vaccines.
