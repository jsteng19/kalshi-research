So we're going to Canada. Last night was a tremendous success, with a fantastic audience. It was supposed to rain. They gave it a 100% chance of rain, and it didn't rain at all. It was beautiful. And so I asked, if they gave it 100% chance -- right? -- 100%, it was going to rain like crazy, and it didn't rain at all, how do they predict 100 years out and 50 years out or 200 years out?

They didn't do too well, the weather people last night. But it was beautiful.

Well, we get along very well, and, uh, I will tell you that I think I have great respect for each other.

Go ahead, what?

Well, I hope there's going to be a deal. I think it's time for a deal, and we'll see what happens. But, sometimes they have to fight it out, but we're going to see what happens. I think there's a good chance there'll be a deal.

What?

So the protesters, if we didn't have the National Guard on call and ready, they would rip Los Angeles apart. They come, and they check, and they say, "Is the National Guard going to be there?" And if the National Guard's being there, they don't even show up.

Well, I don't want to say that.

Look, we have our trade deals. All we have to do is send a letter, this is what you're going to have to pay. But I think we'll have a few new trade deals, yeah.

We do, yeah. Thank you very much, everybody.
