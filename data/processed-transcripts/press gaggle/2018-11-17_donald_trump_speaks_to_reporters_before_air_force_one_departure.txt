So we just met with the families of the victims and the first responders, and we met with the police, law enforcement, incredible people. And, the families., what can you say other than it's so... it's so sad to see. These are great people. Great families. They're torn apart. It's tragic... it was a tragic event.

We met with some police officers, as you know, these are very brave people to do what they did, and we just hugged them and we kissed them and everybody, and... it was very warm. It was very warm. It's a safe community. It's supposed to be one of the safest communities, and yet, something like that happened. Very sad. But it was tragic, and yet in one way it was a very beautiful moment.

I was with the parents of a young, very young supporter, a young supporter, wearing a Trump shirt and just a terrific young man. So it was a tough thing to do. This has been a tough day, when you look at all of the the death from one place to the next, and then we leave from here.

That was a tragic event that took place. I want to thank you. You stayed with us. This is a long day for you also. I just felt this is something we had to do, and I'm very glad we did it. Thank you. Thank you.

It is a very tough situation. We're working on a lots of different things. It's been going on for a long time. It's been going on, I guess, in many respects, far longer than people want to talk about. But it's a -- a very sad thing to see. Thank you all very much. I'll see you up here.
