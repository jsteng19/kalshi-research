Hello everybody.

So we're going to Texas. Some of you are coming with us. How are you? And it's a horrible thing, a horrible thing. Nobody can even believe it, such a thing, that much water that fast without a dam break, you'd think a dam would have to break to have to it. So it's a terrible thing, but we're going to be there with some of the great families and others, the governor, everybody is going to be there.

Maybe at some point I'll talk to him. Right now, I'm not. They're treating President Bolsonaro very unfairly. He's a good man. You know, I know him well. I negotiated with him. He was a very tough negotiator and I can tell you, he was a very honest man and he loved the people of Brazil. He was a very tough guy to negotiate with.

I shouldn't like him because he was very tough in negotiation, but he was also very honest. And I know the honest ones and I know the crooked ones.

We're going to see. It was sent yesterday. They called. I think it was fairly well received, but it's what we need, so we'll see what happens.

I know. You'll be seeing things happen.

I think we've done very well on immigration. We were given a very bad hand by Biden. He allowed 25 million people to come in totally unchecked, unvetted. We're getting the criminals out and we're getting them out fast. The courts have ultimately done the right thing. Amazingly, they've really done the right thing.

And they understand it's really the survival of our country. It's a very important thing. We can't have, like, 11,888 murderers and, you know, something that you should have that you haven't reported, as you know, 300,000 children are missing, right, 300,000 under Biden. We've already gotten back 10,000 of those children and we have a lot more planned to come back.

We're getting them back by the thousands, but 300,000 and as of this morning, over 10,000, we've gotten back.

Oh, I think just keep working hard. We've been taken advantage of for many, many years by countries, both friend and foe. And frankly, the friends have been worse than the foes, in many cases. So I would say just keep working. It's all going to work out.

No. I think he's doing a terrible job. I think we should be -- no, I think we should be three points lower interest rate. He's costing our country a lot of money. We should be number one and we're not. And that's because of Jerome Powell, in terms of interest. We are number one in the world. Look, I'll tell you a little simple language.

One year ago, our country was a dead country. We were going nowhere except down. We were the laughing stock all over the world and now we're the hottest country anywhere in the world. We're number one everywhere, anywhere in the world and that's all they're talking about is our country. One year ago it was a dead country, now it's the hottest country anywhere in the world. Thank you.
