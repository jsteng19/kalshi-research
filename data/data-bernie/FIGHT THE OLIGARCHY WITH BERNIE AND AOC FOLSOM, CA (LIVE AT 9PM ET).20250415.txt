Bome. Thank
you. You
know, Alexandria and I a few days ago
were in LA.
LA is a city of some 4 million people
and we had some 36,000 people out. A
great turnout.
Folultum is a city of
85,000 and we have almost as many people
here as we had in LA.
I'm told we have close to 30,000 people
here.
Unbelievable. Let me thank Bolson Lake
College, Aisha
Shaw, Dog Patch, the Filmonic, Jane Kim,
Lorena Gonzalez, and Everett Kelly.
And let me thank Congresswoman
Alexandria
Kaziocortez for not only being a great
member of Congress, but for being an
inspiration to millions of young people
throughout this country.
We are here this
evening to say very loudly and
clearly to Mr. Trump and people all over
this
country, we as Americans will not accept
oligarchy.
We will not accept
authoritarianism. And we will not accept
a rigged economy where working people
struggle while billionaires become
richer.
We will not accept a situation where if
you can believe it, one man, Elon Musk,
you have heard of
Elon. Elon owns more wealth than the
bottom
50% of households in America.
That, brothers and sisters, is insane.
We have got to
together create an economy that works
for working people, not just Mr. Musk
and the billionaire class.
And to make a bad situation even worse,
at a time of
unprecedented income and wealth
inequality, never had more inequality
ever in America than we have today. Mr.
Musk and the Republicans in Congress are
working on a reconciliation
bill. And this is
legislation that would give
$1.1 trillion in tax breaks to the top
1%. And they pay for that by cutting
Medicaid by
880 billion dollars.
cutting nutrition programs for hungry
kids and cutting affordable housing.
Now, you've got a congressman here whose
name is Kevin Kylie.
So, I don't know if Mr. Kylie is
watching the live stream or not.
Well, Mr. Kylie, I think some of your
constituents have a message for you.
Don't vote to give tax breaks to
billionaires and cut programs that the
working class of this country
desperately
needs. And by the way, Mr. Kylie, I have
a feeling that some of your constituents
would love to sit down and chat with you
on that
issue. Now, Alexandria comes from New
York City. I come from Vermont. We've
come a long way here. The least you
could do is sit down with your
constituents right here.
You know, as I observe what's going on
in
DC, I think a little bit about American
history and I think about Abraham
Lincoln at Gettysburg in 1863. And I
think you all know this. Lincoln was
there a few days after that horrific
battle where 20,000 Union soldiers were
killed or wounded in the fight to end
the nightmare of
slavery. And Lincoln looked out on the
field just a few days after that
carnage and he said, "You know
what? Our vision of
America is a government of the
people, by the
people, for the
people. And that's why Alexandria and I
are here this
evening. We believe in a government of
the people, by the people, and for the
people. not a government of the
billionaires, by the billionaires, and
for the
billionaires. And when we talk about
oligarchy, it's not just the incredible
economic power that the billionaires
have, which is
unprecedented. And it's not just about
the massive income and wealth
inequality, which is also
unprecedented. Today in America, as a
result of that disastrous Supreme Court
decision on Citizens
United, billionaires like Musk can put
unlimited amounts of money into both
political parties.
So, Mr. Busk himself put
$270
million to elect Donald Trump as
president. And that for Musk was a
pretty good investment. Not a lot of
money when you're worth three 400
billion. So, it's a modest investment.
and his reward was to become the most
powerful person in the United States
government. But I must tell you, it is
not only Musk and the
Republicans who are putting huge amounts
of money to make sure they elect the
candidates of their choice. It is
Democrats as well.
And there is a reason
why Democrats for so many of years have
not had the courage to stand up to the
ruling class and represent working
people and that is because that party is
dominated by corporate interests.
So today we say loudly and clearly and I
think in saying this I speak for
conservatives and progressives and
moderates moderates. The time is now to
get rid of this disastrous Citizen
United Supreme Court
decision and move to public funding of
elections. But brothers and sisters, it
is not just oligarchy that we are
fighting. We are fighting a president
who undermines our constitution every
single day and threatens our freedom of
speech and freedom of assembly.
We are fighting a president whose agents
are rounding up innocent people off the
streets, throwing them into unmarked
vans and sending them to detention
centers here in the United States in El
Salvador and elsewhere.
That is not what happens in a democracy.
That's what happens in a
dictatorship. And together, we are not
going to allow Donald Trump to create an
authoritarian society.
You know, the founding
fathers of our country were not
dummies. They had just fought a war
against the British Empire and defeated
the most powerful person on earth at
that time, the king of
England. And they sat around and they
said, "You know what? as we develop our
new country. This is in the 1790s. What
they were saying is we do not want to
give one person unlimited power. And
they developed a separation of powers.
We got an executive, a legislative
branch, and a
judiciary to keep check on each
other. And every single day you got a
president who wants more and more power
for
himself. He is usurping the power of the
Congress. He is now challenging in an
unprecedented way the role of the
judiciary in America.
Supreme Court recently ruled in a nine
to nothing decision that a man who was
illegally picked off the street and sent
El Salvador has got to be
returned. A nine to nothing decision of
the Supreme Court. Mr. President, obey
the law.
But it is not just Congress and the
judiciary whose power he is trying to
assume. It is the media as well.
Apparently he does not understand that
in America we have freedom of speech.
He has sued
ABC,
CBS, Meta, the De Moine Register. His
FCC is now
investigating NPR and
PBS. Just the other day, he said that
CBS should lose its license. You know
what they did? They ran a program which
was critical of some of his policies.
How
terrible. And this is from a guy who has
spent his entire political career
attacking people, lying about people in
the most vicious
ways. So we say to Trump, if you can't
take criticism, get out of politics.
This is a democracy and criticism and
freedom of speech is what it's all
about.
Brothers and sisters, our
job is not just right now to defeat the
very dangerous situation inherent in
Trumpism. We've got to fight him every
single day.
But we have got to do more than
that. We have got to create a vision of
what a new America is about.
where we have a government and an
economy that works for all of us, not
just a few.
This is the wealthiest country in the
history of the world. We should not have
the highest rate of childhood poverty of
almost any major country on earth.
Zero through four are the most important
years of human development. We should
have the best child care system in the
world, not a dysfunctional
system. We should have the strongest
public education system on earth.
Do we have any teachers here?
Thank you teachers.
And we want to make sure that our
teachers are well- paid and are
respected. No teacher in America should
start off at less than
$60,000 a year.
Unlike Trump, we understand the
importance of education.
Learning and growing intellectually is
part of what being human is about.
And in a competitive global economy, we
need the best educated workforce in the
world.
We need more doctors. We need more
nurses. We need more
dentists. We need more electricians,
plumbers, sheet metal
workers. Young people should not have to
go deeply in debt to get the education
they need.
You know, back in
1944, President Franklin Delano
Roosevelt, one of the great presidents
in our
history, he said something that was
enormously profound. It kind of got
passed over because we're in the middle
of World War II. But what he said at
that point is said, "Look, we have a
great Constitution, freedom of speech,
freedom of assembly, freedom of
religion, etc., But we're lacking
something. And what we're lacking is the
understanding that economic rights are
human
rights. Now, the
establishment the establishment doesn't
want us to understand what that means.
But what it means is that living in this
country, the richest country on earth, a
country where today we're seeing an
explosion of technology, which is going
to make us even wealthier. What we want
is that technology to work for working
people, not just the owners of the
corporations.
Brothers and sisters, it is not a
radical idea. It really isn't. You know,
the establishment and the moneyed
interests will tell you, "Oh, this is a
terrible idea." But in this country,
every man, woman, and child can and
should have a decent standard of living.
We should not have what a
disgrace in LA here in Burlington,
Vermont. We got together as a nation,
800,000 people sleeping out on the
streets of
America. We've got 20 million people who
are spending half of their limited
incomes on housing.
Maybe instead of spending a trillion
dollars a year on the military, what
about building 5 million units of
low-income and affordable
housing? If you can believe it, if you
can believe it, and it's true. Over the
last 52
years, the average American worker today
in inflation accounted for dollars is
earning less than he or she did back
then. You got that? Think about all of
the increase in worker productivity.
They didn't have computers back there.
They didn't have cell phones. Workers
are producing much more today than they
did 52 years ago. And yet in real
dollars they're earning less.
It is time to raise the minimum wage to
a living
wage. And brothers and
sisters, it is the trade union movement
in America that has developed and
created the middle class.
And millions of workers all over
America want to join unions. We got some
trade unionists here tonight.
Thank
you. They want to join unions, but
they're unable to do so because
employers use illegal tactics to prevent
them from organizing.
And that is why we're going to pass
what's called the PRO Act to make sure
that every worker in America will be
able to join a union.
You may or may not
know that in America today, we remain
the only major country on earth not to
guarantee health care to all people as a
human right.
We have a health care system which is
broken, which is
dysfunctional, which is
cruel. As a nation, we are spending
almost twice as much. We spend over
$14,000 for every man, woman, and child
for healthcare. 14,000 bucks. And yet,
despite spending so much, 85 million
Americans are uninsured or
underinsured. 60
60,000 Americans die each year because
they cannot afford to go to a doctor
when they should.
I have talked to doctors in Vermont and
all over this country who treat patients
who walk in the door and they say, "Why
didn't you come in here when you first
felt your symptoms?" And the patient
said, "I'm uninsured or my deductible is
too high. I just didn't have the money."
That is outrageous. It is unacceptable.
We must pass Medicare for all.
and guarantee healthc care to every man,
woman, and
child. And when we talk about what
oligarchy is about and when we talk
about what corporate greed is about, I
want you to hear one fact that you won't
see in the corporate media or hear in
the halls of Congress right now. As a
nation, our life expectancy, how long we
live, is about four years less than
other major countries. That's pretty
bad. Do you know what's even worse? If
you are working class in America, on
average, you will live 7 years shorter
lives than if you are wealthy.
And you know why that is? Why is that?
You got it. Everybody knows the word is
stress.
I grew up in a working class family and
I've been all over this country talking
to workingass people. Do you know what
it's like to wake up in the morning and
wonder about whether you're going to be
able to feed your kids or not? You know
what it's like to know what when you get
sick or your mother is ill, you may not
have the money to get the medical care
you need. You know what it's like that
when your car breaks down, you don't
have the thousand bucks you need to
repair it. You can't get to work. All
over this country, people are
struggling. Every single day just to
survive. Brothers and sisters, in the
richest country in the history of the
world, we can do a hell of a lot better
than that.
Thank you.
but in truth it is not Bernie.
It is
you. And that does that's not rhetoric.
If we are going to defeat Trumpism, if
we're going to create the kind of nation
that we know we can
become, it's going to take millions and
millions of working people standing up
together, educating, organizing,
knocking on doors, forming unions.
We can do it. Now, what the ruling class
of this country does, and they do it
brilliantly. I must confess what they do
is essentially tell you, you are
powerless. Ain't nothing you can do cuz
we the oligarchs, we got all the money,
we got all the power, we own the media,
we own the Congress. Ain't nothing you
can do about it.
Well, we are here this evening to tell
them, "Hey guys, you got it wrong."
Because when we stand
together and not let Trump and his
friends divide us up by the color of our
skin or where we were born or our sexual
orientation or our
religion, when we stand together, there
is nothing we cannot accomplish.
So in
this pivotal moment in American history,
what I have discovered as Alexandria and
I go all over this country, we are
seeing unbelievable turnouts. We were in
Idaho.
Idaho. We had 12,000 people coming out
in Idaho, most conservative state in the
country.
We have 20,000 people in Salt Lake City,
a Republican
state. And I think what the American
people, Republicans, independents,
Democrats are saying, "Sorry, Mr. Trump.
We don't want your
oligarchy. Sorry, Mr. Trump. Too many
men and women have fought and died to
defend democracy. You're not going to
take us into
authoritarianism. And sorry, Mr. Musk,
we're going to create an economy that
works for us, not just for
you. So, brothers and sisters, I
recognize that the oligarchs have
enormous power. They have unlimited
amounts of
money and they are extraordinarily
greedy. They want it all. But the last
that I have
heard, I'm not a mathematician, but I do
know that 99% is a hell of a lot bigger
number than 1%.
So, let us stand together. Let us defeat
Trumpism. Let us kind create the kind of
America we know we can become. Thank you
very much.
