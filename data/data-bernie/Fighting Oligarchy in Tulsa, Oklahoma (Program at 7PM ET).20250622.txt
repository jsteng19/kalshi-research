Thank you Tulsa
There are a lot of people here
maybe not as exciting as the NBA finals
but maybe more important
let me thank Luke Harris Parker Milsap and I very much appreciate you know I am
a big big Woody Guthrie fan
and you should be very proud of the enormous contribution that Guthrie has
made on American culture Want to thank the Get Up Kids Stacey
Woolly Sha Wright Susan Cole Young and Jimmy Curry with the Oklahoma AFL CIO
Thanks very much
So why was I in Macallen Texas last night
shreveport Louisiana this afternoon Amarillo Texas tomorrow and Fort Worth
tomorrow night [Applause]
There are a couple of reasons First of all in a nation where people try to divide
us up in every which way I do not accept the concept of blue state red state
Our country today faces enormous problems and we have got to come
together as Americans And I believe from the bottom of my
heart as somebody who has had the privilege of visiting every state in
this nation that the vast majority of the American people believe in economic
justice social justice environmental justice racial justice
And that's true in red states It's true in blue states as well And the other
reason more political is that for the love of me I cannot
understand how the Democratic Party has turned its back on states like Oklahoma
Louisiana and Texas
[Applause] I don't understand how you can be a
national party and in states all over this country the
Democratic Party has not played the role it should in standing up for the working
class of this country
[Applause]
I'm going to talk a little bit about bad news and I'm going to talk about good news And the bad news is as I think
almost all Americans understand is that right now we are facing
enormous problems And I think there is little debate that the crisis we are
facing are the worst in the modern history of America
And what is more frightening and I think troubling to many Americans is that we have a
president of the United States who is making these problems even worse
[Applause] That's the bad news But the good news is
that all over this country the American people are fighting back right here in
Tulsa and all over Our
[Applause] fighting oligarchy tour has now brought out more than 260,000
[Music] people in 15 states
and maybe even more significantly last Saturday just the week ago we had no
king rallies in every state in America
Millions and millions millions of people all across this
country came out and they were loud and they were clear in saying that in our
great country no we do not accept oligarchy
[Applause] and a government of the billionaires
We will not accept authoritarianism
And a president who obviously has never read or understood the Constitution of
the United States
We will not accept kleptocracy A president who is using his office to
enrich himself and his family in a way we have never seen
[Applause] And we will not see we will not accept
horrific attacks on the working class of this country
[Applause] or legislation
that gives massive tax breaks to billionaires and cuts back on the most
basic needs that working families depend upon
So let me cut to the chase and tell you what I think most of you already know
Sadly tragically we are living right now in an oligarchic form of society
Some of you may remember from elementary school the speech that Abraham Lincoln gave at
Gettysburg He was there at Gettysburg a few days
after the terrible battle of Gettysburg Thousands and thousands of soldiers died
fighting against the abomination of slavery
And Lincoln looked out at the crowd and he said that these
soldiers who gave their lives shall not have died in vain because we will be a
government of the people [Applause]
That's what we believe And we're not going to let Trump or anybody else take that away from us
[Applause]
Now I talk about oligarchy but I think Donald Trump has made the point more clearly than I
ever could If some of you recall his inauguration
sitting right and I was there I got pushed into the front row for whatever reason
A surreal experience I will tell you And right behind Trump as you recall
were the three wealthiest people in America Mr Musk Mr Bezos Mr Zuckerberg
You are familiar with those gentlemen And right behind them
seated in the section for the VIPs were 13 other billionaires who Trump had
nominated to head up major government agencies
[Applause] So that's what it is You got a
government today of the billionaire class by the billionaire class and for the
billionaire class And we say no way
We are going to fight for a government that represents working families and not
just the 1%
And when we talk about oligarchy it's not just Trump and his cabinet and his agency
heads understand that today in America we have more income and wealth
inequality than we have ever had in the history of
our nation [Music] today in America And this is really
unbelievable and you don't see it much in the media corporate media You don't hear it much in the halls of a corporate
Congress But today one man Mr Musk owns more
wealth than the bottom 52% of American households
[Applause] Does anybody in America I don't care if
you're a conservative Republican a progressive whatever you may be does anybody think it is vaguely sane and
right that one person has so much wealth
today in America the top 1% owns more wealth than the bottom 93%
Today in America the CEOs of these large corporations
now make 350 times more than their average worker
[Music] [Applause] But when we talk about oligarchy it is
not just income and wealth inequality Today we have more concentration of
ownership than we've ever had in our nation's history in sector after sector of our
economy Whether it is agriculture transportation financial services health
care big tech media whatever it is you have a small number of giant
corporations who control what is produced and the prices that you pay in
the store
But here is maybe the most important point that I want to get across this evening
The oligarchs not only have enormous economic power
they have unprecedented political power over both political
parties [Applause] [Music]
If a Republican tomorrow were to jump up and say "You know I kind
of think it's a bad idea to give tax breaks to the rich and cut health care
for working families." Do you know what would happen to that Republican the next day elon Musk or some other billionaire
would say you are finished politically We are going to primary you We own the
system and you do not as your constituents want you to do but what we
the billionaire class tells you to do
Our campaign finance system is so corrupt
that it enables Mr Musk to spend $270
million getting Trump elected
And when you spend $270 million you get something in return And
what Musk got in return was the right to be the most powerful person in
government to go around throwing workers off of the Social Security Administration
and to propose firing 83,000
employees at the Veterans Administration [Applause]
These are the men and women who put their lives on the line to defend us
Musk and his friends do not have the right to break the bond we have
established We're not going to let them fire thousands of workers at the
Veterans Administration
But it's not just Republicans although nobody has ever seen a
situation where ordinary Republican members of Congress are scared to death to defy
Trump because they will get politically punished Not just the Republicans So let me tell you and some of you may agree
with me when I tell you this and some of you may not but I want to say it
In my view what is going on in Gaza right now is
unspeakable
in a way in a way that is
almost painful to think about Right now as we speak right here children in Gaza
are starving to death and people innocent men women and children are being shot down 52,000 have already been
killed And as some of you may know a couple of months ago I introduced a
resolution to end all military aid to the extremist Netanyahu government
Now the point that I want to make the point that I want to make is that on
that resolution there were two separate resolutions One got 15 votes to the Senate One got 16 votes
Now if anybody here for one moment thinks that a lot more than 16 members
of the Senate didn't understand what was going on in Gaza and weren't repelled
and disgusted by what's going on in Gaza you would be mistaken They do know
what's going on But if they stood up and said no to aid to Netanyahu they would
be punished by Apac and other super PACs [Applause]
So what you have right now is a political system that is corrupt that is
dominated by billionaire super PACs And the most important political thing that
we can do is get rid of that terrible Citizens United Supreme Court decision
We are we are supposed to be a democracy
and that means we have differences of opinion and we cherish that
People should be able to run for office without having to beg billionaires for
campaign contributions
But it is not just Gaza Right now as I think all of you are
aware Israel recently attacked Iran
[Applause] And there are a number of members of
Congress who know better but are afraid to stand up and say what
I believe needs to be said We will not go to war against Iran
Now I remember 20 plus years ago I remember as a member
of the House of Representatives from Vermont I remember all of the rhetoric
about how we had to go to war against Iraq how Saddam Hussein had
weapons of mass destruction there was going to be a mushroom cloud over Manhattan etc etc And I'm hearing
that same rhetoric now Well it turned out that those people who
got us into the war in Iraq were terribly horrifically wrong We lost some
4500 wonderful young men and I will never forget going to funeral after funeral
for young men in Vermont who died in that war I visited the hospital Walter
Reed Hospital in Washington where people came back without arms or legs 32,000
were wounded War is not the answer
[Applause]
And I get sick and tired of seeing billionaires
and their political friends sending our young people off to their death We have enough problems in this country to
invest in rather than spending billions more putting our young people's lives at risk in Iran
But I say all of that not just to talk about foreign policy as important as that is but to make the point that if
you think there is a rational discussion in Washington hearings what should we do
they are not These policies are dictated by
billionaires and wealthy campaign countries And we talk about what's going
on domestically While the top 1% in America have never
ever had it so good all of you know that there is another reality
taking place that many of you right here tonight are experiencing And that is
that there are millions and millions of families in our country struggling to
put food on the table struggling to pay for rent struggling to pay for a visit
to the doctor's office and other basic needs
We are and this is I want everybody to think about this What the establishment
and the moneyed people tell you is that we just can't afford to do a lot of things Yeah it's too bad people don't
have health care Too bad kids can't get an education Too bad kids in America go
hungry But you know we're a really poor country We just cannot afford it We
could spend a trillion dollars on the military We could give massive tax breaks to the
rich [Applause] But somehow we cannot take care of our
own And what I want everybody here to know that you are living not only in the
richest country on earth but the richest country in the history of the world There is no reason no reason why every
man woman and child in this country is not enjoying a decent standard of living
I want to tell you something else that you're not going to see on TV or here in the
halls of Congress At a time when 60%
of our people live paycheck to paycheck You all know what paycheck to paycheck is about
Yeah I grew up in a family that lived paycheck to paycheck And I will never
It's part of my DNA Will never forget the stresses on my family the arguments
that took place My mother's dream was to own her own house We lived in a rent control
apartment She died young and never achieved that goal But that's what's happening all over America today People
are waking up and they're saying "What happens if my landlord raises the rent
my kid is sick but I can't afford to take her to the doctor What happens if
my car breaks down and the mechanic tells me it's a,000 bucks to get it
fixed i don't have a,000 bucks And if I don't get my go get to work I get fired
If I get fired all hell breaks loose Millions and millions of Americans are
living under that stress every single day We don't talk about it but that is
the reality And you know what happens
and you know what happens when you wake up in the morning and go to bed at night
living with that kind of stress what doctors will tell you it impacts your
mind It impacts your body Stress kills
Stress makes us sick And one of the outrageous facts that we
don't talk about you know our despite all the money we spend on healthcare in America we live about four years shorter
lives than people in other wealthy countries That's bad What's even worse
is if you are workingass in America you will live on average 7 years shorter
life than the 1% In other words
the economics of workingclass people in America is such that it really amounts
to a death sense And we have got to address that And our job together is to
create an economy that works for all of us not just the 1%
But it is not just workingass workers today who are under assault who are
struggling In America today if you can believe it half of older workers people in their 55
60 years of age have nothing in the bank as they face retirement
Talk about stress You're 60 years old You're going to be out of a job in a few years You got nothing in the bank
In America today a lot of people don't know this I learned this when I was chairman of a committee that studied
this stuff 22% of senior citizens in America are
living or trying to live on $15,000 or less How disgraceful is that
[Applause] in America today 85 million of us are
uninsured no health insurance or underinsured
Anybody here have a large deductible what's your deductible
5,000 Other deductibles how much
12,000 How much 15,000
So you know when you hear statistics and it's true in my state we have a very low rate of uninsured people but it
doesn't mean anything because people are having 5 10 $15,000 deductible And in
the real world that means you can't go to a doctor You know you get hit by a bus it kicks
in But for most people those deductibles if you don't have money prevent you from
going to the doctor In America today again I want everybody to hear it
because we have got to deal with this stuff We have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major
nation on Earth
We have 800,000 Americans who are homeless
and 20 million households who are spending 50% of their limited
incomes on housing
Now if you're spending 50% of your income on housing how do you
have money to do anything else but that is the reality for tens of millions of
families And there's something else And again we don't What really bothers me is
that in the media for obvious reasons and in Congress for obvious reasons we
don't talk about these issues Let me tell you something else Everybody here knows
that over the last 50 years there has been an explosion in technology
And that means that every worker here is far more productive than he or she was
People doing the same job 50 years ago One would think
that with all of that increase in worker productivity workers would be doing
better and better Right wrong
Because what's happened is that today in inflation accounted for weekly wages
workers are worse off than they were 52
years ago
And during that same time there has been a 79
trillion transfer of wealth from the bottom 90% to the top 1%
[Music] So you want to know why the average
American is angry why the average American thinks quite correctly that the system is broken they're working hard
sometimes 40 50 60 hours They've been working for years They go nowhere in a
hurry And they're worried that their kids may be even worse off economically
than they are This is a system which is rigged on
behalf of the big money interests against working families And again
we have got to demand that with all of this wealth with all of this increased
productivity workers gain the benefits not just the 1%
And let me tell you that this issue is going to come to a head very soon
because we are looking as much as we have seen increases in technology in
recent years You ain't seen nothing yet because right now CEOs of major
corporations are unveiling artificial intelligence and robotics in a way that we have never
ever seen And what that means is that the job that you have and you have is
not going to be there in 10 years Will there be new jobs created yeah But in my
view the amount of job loss will be far greater than the amount of jobs gained
And when we look at technology it seems to me that technology is not good or bad
It is who benefits from it If there is a dangerous job
or a job of drudgery that a robot can do good
If there is artificial intelligence that can help us great
But once again the benefits have got to acrue to working people not just the
owners of that technology
And what does that mean some of you some of the union folks here may know that
last year the UAW we got any union people here
uaw when they had their negotiations with the big three automakers they
proposed a 32hour work week
And what they are saying and what we should be thinking of is with all of
this new technology what it should mean is that we have more time to spend with
our friends with our family to pursue the joys of life that we want We want to
benefit from that technology
On Monday night I will be back in Washington DC
and the Senate will begin deliberations on one of the worst pieces of
legislation produced in many many years [Applause]
This is the reconciliation bill or to quote Mr Trump the big beautiful bill
[Applause] So I want to tell you what is in this
big beautiful bill At a time of unprecedented income and wealth
inequality this bill would provide 650
billion dollar in tax breaks to the top 1%
It would provide over $200 billion
in tax breaks to the top two ten of 1%
[Applause] It would provide a tax break of more
than 400 billion to large corporations that are stashing their profits in
offshore tax havens like the Cayman Islands [Applause]
So if you're going to give away 650 billion in tax breaks to the 1%
and you give away 400 billion to large profitable corporations how you going to pay for it and this is what is really
quite disgusting and outrageous about this bill
This bill would cut Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act by over $1 trillion
And what does that mean what does that mean how does it impact you well it impacts Americans because the
Congressional Budget Office which is a nonpartisan uh organization in Congress they
estimated that if this bill were to go through 16
million Americans would lose their health insurance
This bill for the first time forces millions of Medicaid recipients
who make as little as $16,000 a year to pay a co-pay of $35 every time
they go to the doctor Now what happens when you throw
16 million low-income and workingclass people off of their health insurance
well last week Yale University and the
University of Pennsylvania released a study and they said if you throw these
16 million people off of healthcare and you have $35 co-ayments
over 50,000 Americans will die unnecessarily
each and every year
I mean it is hard to imagine that anybody with half a conscience
would vote for a piece of legislation that would result in the unnecessary deaths of 50,000 fellow Americans
But it is not just individuals who are going to be impacted
by these cuts in Medicaid If you know somebody who is in a nursing
home understand the majority of the money that goes to nursing homes comes
from Medicaid If you go to community health centers and I've worked really hard to expand community health centers
all over America 32 million people utilize them They depend on Medicaid
Their quality of service will decline rural hospitals will literally go out of
business because they depend upon Medicaid In other words at a time when
our health care system is broken right now anyone doubt that the health care
system in America is broken this would make it far far worse
But it's not just healthcare that they're going after in order to
give tax breaks to billionaires This legislation would cut $290
billion from nutrition programs
[Applause] Sadly in America again in the richest
country on earth we have kids who go hungry and we have elderly people who
are not getting the nutrition that they need This bill would cut back on lunch
programs for kids breakfast programs you know programs like Meals on Wheels for seniors cut back on those very important
programs [Applause] This bill would slash funding for
education by $350 billion
[Applause] In every state in this country there are
young people who dream of getting a higher education going to college maybe going to a trade school this bill this
bill would make it much harder Now a few weeks ago
uh Mike Johnson the Republican Speaker of the House [Applause]
who said that there was a moral component to this legislation
Well I don't believe that there is any religion
on earth who thinks it is moral to give tax breaks to billionaires and cut back
on feeding hungry [Applause]
There is nothing moral about passing a law which will result in the unnecessary
deaths of 50,000 people
But it's not only this very bad piece of legislation that we're dealing with They're going after
Social Security
As I mentioned they're going after the Veterans Administration
[Applause]
All [Applause]
right let me conclude Just in case you're wondering what they're going about
[Applause]
this is a statement statement from Donald Trump Quote we have completed our
very successful attack on the three nuclear sites in Iran etc
Heat
[Applause] Heat [Applause]
I agree And I want to tell you something
Not only is this news that I've just heard this second alarming that all of
you have just heard but it is so grossly unconstitutional
All of you know that the only entity that can take this
country to war is the US Congress The president does not have the right
[Music] And I was talking a moment ago
about the fact that we are living in one of the most difficult moments in
the modern history of this country And Trump Trump just made it that much more
difficult That's just another burden we're going to have to carry And that's just another message we're going to have
to get out all over this country The American people do not want more war
more death
You know it might be a good idea if we concentrated on the problems that exist
in Oklahoma and Vermont
rather than getting involved in another war that the American people
do not want Let me let me just say this that in the
midst of all of what is going on what is enormously important is that we
do not give up on a vision of where this
country must go [Applause]
What the establishment what the establishment wants you to
believe is that you have no power that you can't
accomplish anything They have it all Nothing you could do
And in this moment in American history what we have got to do in Vermont and
Oklahoma in Texas all over this country is stand up and fight back and tell them
this is our country
And I don't care I don't care if you are a progressive a
moderate or a conservative This country belongs to all of us not just a handful
of billionaires
And when we look out into the future the kind of America we want let's understand
a few things Number one instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires we
should demand they start paying their fair share of taxes
No we should not be throwing 16 million Americans off the
health care they have We should be doing what every other major country does
Guarantee healthcare to all as a human right
This is this is not a radical idea
It exists in virtually every other wealthy country The function of a
rational health care system is not to make hundreds of billions for the drug
companies and the insurance companies It's to provide quality care to all
When we look into the future we must demand that every worker in America
earns a decent wage Raise the minimum wage to at least 17 bucks an hour
We can create millions of goodaying jobs by union jobs by building
5 million units of lowincome and affordable housing
Not a radical idea Not a radical idea to say that in a competitive global economy
every young person in this country regardless of income should have the right to get a higher education
We can and must make public colleges and universities community colleges trade
schools tuitionfree
And when we talk about freedom and many of my colleagues talk about freedom
every day Well what freedom means among other things is that every woman in this
country has a right to control her own body
And let me just say this these are tough times and you
just heard five minutes ago going to be even tougher But in the midst of all of
that not just for our lives but more importantly for our kids and our
grandchildren we have got to understand that despair is not an option
That's what they want us to believe
None of us have the privilege of hiding under the covers The stakes are just too
high And I would like to remind all of you short history lesson that throughout
the history of this country what we have always seen is that real change
fundamental change never takes place from the top on down It is always from
the bottom on up
[Music]
Never forget the bravery you know we take it for granted now of the people back in 1776
who had the courage to take on the most powerful empire in the world and they
beat him
Never forget in the 1840s the abolitionist movement stood up and said
slavery is an abomination We will end slavery
Never forget that workers in the 1920s 1930s stood up and said "We are tired
of being oppressed by our bosses We're going to form a strong trade union
movement
Never forget the civil rights movement of the 1960s and Dr King
the women's movement the environmental movement the gay rights movement
Yes Yes The oligarchs are enormously powerful I deal with them
every day They have endless amounts of money They control our economy They own
much of the media They have enormous influence over both political parties
But from the bottom of my heart and I would not be here this evening if I did
not believe this I believe that if we do not allow them to divide us up by the
color of our skin or where we were born or our religion
or our sexual orientation
If we stand together we can defeat them and create the kind
of nation that working people in America deserve Thank you all very much
[Applause]
Power to the people Power to the people
