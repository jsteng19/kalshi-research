Donald Trump: Hello, this is your President. The opioid and drug crisis has affected almost every family in our country. It's devastating, and we've made a lot of progress, a lot of tremendous progress. But we have Take Back Day. It's called Take Back.

Donald Trump: We want you to go out and collect all of those drugs and opioids and everything you have that you know what's good and you know what's bad, and bring it into a location near you -- there are lists available everywhere -- get rid of them. We want to clean out the United States of all of this excess bad product that people can grab onto, they can do things with, and when they do things, that's not good.

Donald Trump: We want to celebrate our country, and one of the ways we're going to celebrate our country is Take Back day. So go in, do the best you can, get rid of it. It's no good, not going to do you good, and certainly not going to do anybody else any good.

Donald Trump: Take Back Day is this Saturday, October 26th. And I want to just thank everybody, because our drug crisis is always going to be a crisis, but the numbers are way down. We're very, very proud of it.
