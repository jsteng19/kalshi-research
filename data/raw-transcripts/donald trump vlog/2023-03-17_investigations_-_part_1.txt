Donald Trump: These four horrible, radical-left Democrat investigations of your all-time favorite president, me, is just a continuation of the most disgusting witch hunt in the history of our country. It's gone on forever with Russia, Russia, Russia and Ukraine, Ukraine, Ukraine and the Mueller hoax. It's an absolute disgrace what's going on. They even spied on my campaign.

Donald Trump: And remember this: with all of the work that they did on Mueller, no collusion, that's what the answer was. It was all no collusion. Whether it's the Mar-a-Lago raid or the unselect committee hoax, the perfect Georgia phone call -- it was absolutely perfect -- or the Stormy Horseface Daniels extortion plot, they were all sick, and it's fake news.

Donald Trump: Our enemies are desperate to stop us because they know that we are the only ones who can stop them. And they know it very strongly. And they're looking at the polls where not me but we are up by so much, they can't even believe it. We won twice, and now, we've got to win a third time. They know that we can defeat them.

Donald Trump: They know that we will defeat them. But they're not coming after me. They're coming after you. I'm just standing in their way. And I always will stand in their way. Thank you very much.
