Donald Trump: The Democrats don't like being called an angry mob, but really that's what they become. They've gone so far left, they can't even believe that they're over there, they don't know what's going on when you listen to Eric Holder, talking about kicking...

Eric Holder: [Video clip] When they go low, we kick them.

Donald Trump: ...or Hillary Clinton, saying what she said, which was so horrible...

Hillary Clinton: [Video clip] ...you cannot be civil.

Donald Trump: They just don't see it. Maxine Waters constantly --  day in and day out -- ranting and raving...

Maxine Waters: [Video Clip] ...and you push back on them, and you tell them, "you're not welcome."

Donald Trump: They're losing it, and they shouldn't be. We should be a unified country. It'll happen some day.
