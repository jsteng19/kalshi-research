Donald Trump: Mollie Tibbetts -- an incredible young woman, is now permanently separated from her family. A person came in, from Mexico, illegally, and killed her.

Donald Trump: We need the wall. We need our immigration laws changed. We need our border laws changed. We need Republicans to do it, because the Democrats aren't going to do it.

Donald Trump: This is one instance of many. We have tremendous crime trying to come through the borders. We have the worst laws anywhere in the world. Nobody has laws like the United States. They are strictly pathetic.

Donald Trump: We need new immigration laws. We need new border laws. The Democrats will never give them, and the wall is being built. We've started it, but we also need the funding for this year's building of the wall.

Donald Trump: So, to the family of Mollie Tibbets. All I can say, is: God bless, you. God bless you.
