Donald Trump: I want to wish the Jewish people in America and Israel, and all around the world, a very happy Passover. Every year at this time, Jewish families celebrate Godâ€™s liberation of the ancient Israelites from slavery in Egypt, guiding them through the prophet Moses on a forty-year journey to a very, very promised land.

Donald Trump: The story of Exodus, which is retold around the globe and all over the world at every Passover Seder, is a reminder not only of the enduring strength of the Jewish people, but of the importance of putting our faith in Almighty God no matter what the circumstance.

Donald Trump: To all the Jewish families gathering with friends and loved ones this week, have a blessed Passover, and may God continue to watch over the Jewish people, the State of Israel, and the United States of America. Thank you very much.
