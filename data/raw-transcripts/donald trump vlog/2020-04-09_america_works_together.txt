Donald Trump: So remember something: #AmericaWorksTogether. That's for small businesses. Send whatever it is in about how great this experience has been, from the standpoint of us bringing you back. We're bringing small businesses back, bigger and better than ever. There'll be big businesses, by the time we finish.

Donald Trump: A lot of good things are gonna happen. I just left a meeting at the White House, right behind me is the Oval Office -- just left a meeting with our lenders. They want to bring this country back stronger than ever before, and they're lending money, and you know what you have to do. It's one of the best loans I've ever seen.

Donald Trump: The loan expires if you do a few things that are pretty easy to do, like hire people, keep your employees, keep them going. So, great meetings. It's going to be a great success.

Donald Trump: Billions and billions of dollars has already been sold, and when we open, we're going to be opening with a bang, and small businesses will be leading the charge. Thank you very much.
