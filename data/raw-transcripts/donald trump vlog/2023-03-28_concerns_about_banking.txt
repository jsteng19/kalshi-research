Donald Trump: Just a few years ago, I handed Joe Biden the fastest economic recovery in recorded history. But as soon as he came into office, he quickly blew it all up. It was a shame. So sad to watch. I knew what was happening. I could see it and so could others. Biden and the radical Democrat Congress single handedly created the highest inflation in decades.

Donald Trump: They spent trillions of dollars, wage war on American energy, and pursued the socialist joke known as the Green New Deal, an absolute disaster for our country. Now, the inflation and high interest rates that Joe Biden caused have resulted in the Biden banking crisis, a disaster of historic proportions. We are seeing bank failures left and right.

Donald Trump: Biden and his enablers in Congress are directly responsible for creating this economic catastrophe. And with Joe Biden at the wheel, it will only get worse. That's what's happening in almost every single sector. America needs a president who knows how to handle the economy. Under my leadership, we built the greatest economy in the history of the world.

Donald Trump: In fact, we really did it twice. Now, we will do it a third time, and this time, it will stay. I will unleash American energy to get prices down immediately. I will stop the Biden inflation nightmare, and that will go very quickly. I will reverse the Biden tax hikes and regulation hikes and return to a pro-jobs, pro-growth, pro-worker policy that puts America first.

Donald Trump: Together, we will save our economy from destruction. November 5th, 2024 cannot come fast enough. Thank you.
