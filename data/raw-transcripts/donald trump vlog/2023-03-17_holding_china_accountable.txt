Donald Trump: Three years ago, I declared that the China virus almost certainly came from the Wuhan lab. Now, the world is finally admitting the truth, and they're saying I was right. The cover-up of COVID-19's origins is one of the greatest scandals in the history of the world. The greatest scandal is COVID itself, however.

Donald Trump: Millions of people all over the planet have died from the China virus. Now, it's time to hold China and the corrupt forces who have facilitated this colossal suppression of facts accountable for the damage they have inflicted upon the world and all humanity. We have to do something about it. There has to be some form of retribution, and there will be some form of retribution.

Donald Trump: China cannot pay for the damage they've caused. It's more than $50 trillion, and they don't have anything even close to that. But something has to be done, and it will be done.
