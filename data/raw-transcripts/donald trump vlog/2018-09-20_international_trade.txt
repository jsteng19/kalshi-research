Donald Trump: For many years, countries have been taking total advantage of the United States on trade. Whether they are allies or not, they looked at us really as a bunch of very soft touches. And that's not what's happening anymore.

Donald Trump: We've made a deal with Mexico, which is a fair deal, not the deal that we lived with where we were losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year. We're working on other trade deals. But the big one is China, because for a long period of time, China has taken advantage of our country.

Donald Trump: And I don't blame China. I blame the people that represented our nation to allow that to happen, where $375 billion in trade deficits came about year after year. We don't want that. Not fair. Not right.

Donald Trump: So we've placed massive tariffs on China, and the tariffs have really had a positive impact. Number one: our countries take it in a lot of money. Number two: we're creating jobs like never before.

Donald Trump: So it's very important that China open its markets to our farmers and everybody else, because right now they're closed, largely. And yet our markets are open to them.

Donald Trump: But let me give you an example that you've heard. China produces a car and they sell it into the United States, and they have a very small 2.5% tax, which, to a large extent they don't even pay. On the other hand we make a car and sell it into China and they charge 25 percent. So it's 25 percent versus 2.5%, and that's the way the deal is: no good, and no good for us. So we're changing things, and we're changing them fast.
