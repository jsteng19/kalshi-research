Donald Trump: I want to give my warmest, best wishes to the people of the Bahamas. I know what you're going through. I spoke to your Prime Minister yesterday, and he's absolutely devastated. It looks like the numbers are going to be far worse than anyone ever thought.

Donald Trump: At the request of your government, the United States has come in. We have the Coast Guard, we have tremendous numbers of people working there.

Donald Trump: We're bringing food, we're bringing water. As you know, in the United States, we weren't hit nearly as hard as was thought, but the Bahamas, you got hit very, very hard.

Donald Trump: I just want to say this: on behalf of the United States, and the people of the United States, we're working hard, we're with you, and God bless you.
