Donald Trump: It was just announced that we had a record-setting jobs report for the month of August, and African-American jobs were the lowest unemployment rate in the history of our country. Likewise, Hispanic job report just came out -- lowest unemployment rate in the history of our country. The women are doing great, Asians, also, lowest in the history of our country.

Donald Trump: It's incredible what's happening. Our economy is strong. Our country is great. We've never been at a better position. More people are working today in the United States than at any time in the history of our country, almost 160 million people.

Donald Trump: So to all fellow American citizens. I say one simple word: congratulations!
