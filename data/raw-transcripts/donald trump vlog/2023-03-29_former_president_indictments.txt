Donald Trump: Can you imagine, I'm leading the opposition within the Republican Party by 30-plus points, and Biden by six-plus points. And everyone is waiting to hear from a local George Soros-backed district attorney, who has watched violent crime in Manhattan soar to record highs as to whether or not he is going to criminally indict me, me for no crime.

Donald Trump: There was no crime. I did nothing wrong. Every prosecutor and the FEC, every single one of them who looked at it, they took a pass. They said "Nothing wrong here." One year ago, he, Alvin Bragg, said there's no way, there's nothing wrong. Now, he's looking at it again. He should prosecute Mark Pomerantz who was a district attorney, and he wrote a book about it during the investigation to make a lot of money.

Donald Trump: And Michael Cohen, who's a sleazebag lawyer, those people should be investigated. It shouldn't be a candidate running for office, especially a leading candidate, but any candidate running for office. They should have done this a long time ago. This has been going on for many, many years. They wait till I go and take a big lead on Biden and a big lead in the Republican Party.

Donald Trump: And then they say, "Let's go and get Trump." The people of our country are not going to take it. Thank you very much.
