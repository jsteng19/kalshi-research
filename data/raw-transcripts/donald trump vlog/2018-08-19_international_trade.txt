Donald Trump: For many years, I've been complaining about the horrible trade deals that our country was making. Our presidents and their representatives were just not treating our workers fairly. They weren't, frankly, treating our companies fairly.

Donald Trump: Those days are over. Right now, we have companies pouring back into our country. We have fair deals. We have really fair deals, and we have many deals in the works. Other countries that took advantage of us are no longer taking advantage of us.

Donald Trump: Our jobs were lost, our taxes were lost, our businesses were lost. Those days are over. We're making great trade deals. We're charging tariffs on certain countries that haven't treated us fairly. They can't believe what's happening. They've never seen anything like it.

Donald Trump: It's all happening for us, and you look at what's going on with our market. Our stock market is way up. Our country is doing well. Other countries are not doing well at all. Now I wish them the best, but they've taken advantage of us long enough.
