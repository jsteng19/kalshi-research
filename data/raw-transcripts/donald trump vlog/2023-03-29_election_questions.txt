Donald Trump: District Attorney Bragg is a danger to our country and should be removed immediately along with radical lunatic bomb-thrower Jack Smith, who is harassing and intimidating innocent people at levels never seen before in our country. "Get Trump" Letitia James, that's her nickname. "Get Trump," the worst attorney general in the United States, and Atlanta DA Fani Willis, who is trying to make a perfect phone call into a plot to destroy America -- no, no, it was a perfect call, absolutely perfect -- but reigns over the most violent crime scene in America.

Donald Trump: Right now, she's reigning over the, per capita, most violent place in America, Atlanta, and she does nothing about it. They're all focused on Trump. They ought to focus on their real job, which is putting criminals in jail and especially violent criminals. Put them in jail, make our country safe again because our country has become a dangerous hellhole.

Donald Trump: Thank you.
