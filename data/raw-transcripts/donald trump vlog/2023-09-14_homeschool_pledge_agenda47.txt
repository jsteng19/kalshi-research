Donald Trump: As president, it was my honor to support America's homeschool families and to protect the God-given right of every parent to be the steward of their children's education. Since the China virus, America has seen an estimated 30 percent increase in homeschool enrollment. When I am reelected, I will do everything I can to support parents who make the courageous choice of homeschool.

Donald Trump: Under the Trump tax cuts, we allowed families to use 529 education savings accounts to spend up to $10,000 a year tax free on tuition for grades K through 12. This was a tremendous win for school choice. Very important, school choice. Remember that term. And yet, that benefit did not apply to homeschoolers.

Donald Trump: So, to support the growing homeschool movement, in my next term, I will immediately fight to allow homeschool parents the same incredible benefit, $10,000 a year per child, completely tax free to spend on costs associated with homeschool education. I will also work to ensure that every homeschool family is entitled to full access to the benefits available to non-homeschool students, including participating in athletic programs, clubs, after-school activities, educational trips, and more.

Donald Trump: To every homeschool family, I will be your champion. Do not vote Democrat. They are looking to destroy you. If you don't mind my saying that, Joe Biden can't put two sentences together, and yet, he's looking to destroy you. Do not vote Democrat. Do not vote for Crooked Joe. Vote for Honest Donald. Thank you very much.
