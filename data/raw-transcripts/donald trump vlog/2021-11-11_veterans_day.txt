Donald Trump: On this Veterans Day, I'd like to pay tribute to all of those incredible people. And you are indeed incredible people who serve so well and so strong and so powerfully in the United States Armed Forces. We love you. Our nation respects you. The world respects you. And we will come back. Our country has gone through a lot.

Donald Trump: The last period of time has been very, very tough watching what you had to watch, but our country will be back. And we'll be back stronger than ever. Happy Veterans Day.
