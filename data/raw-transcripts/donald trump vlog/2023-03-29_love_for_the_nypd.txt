Donald Trump: District Attorney Bragg is a danger to our country and should be removed immediately, along with radical lunatic bomb thrower Jack Smith, who is harassing and intimidating innocent people at levels never seen before in our country; Get Trump, Letitia James -- that's her nickname, Get Trump -- the worst attorney general in the United States; and Atlanta DA Fani Willis, who is trying to make a perfect phone call into a plot to destroy America.

Donald Trump: No, no, it was a perfect call, absolutely perfect. But reigns over the most violent crime scene in America. Right now, she's reigning over the per capita most violent place in America, Atlanta, and she does nothing about it. They're all focused on Trump. They ought to focus on their real job, which is putting criminals in jail and especially violent criminals.

Donald Trump: Put them in jail. Make our country safe again because our country has become a dangerous hellhole. Thank you. Can you imagine the great New York City Police Department, correctly referred to as New York City's Finest, and they are, who for the first and only time in history endorsed a president, me, and honored me as the Man of the Year, having to defend and protect the defunders of police and the cop haters -- these are cop haters -- of the radical left that want to put their greatest champion and friend in prison for a crime that doesn't exist, all the while the Soros-backed DA allows murderers and other violent criminals to freely roam the sidewalks of New York?

Donald Trump: It's not going to happen. We're going to have a safe city. We're going to have a safe country. And these radical left maniacs will have to be dealt with. Thank you.
