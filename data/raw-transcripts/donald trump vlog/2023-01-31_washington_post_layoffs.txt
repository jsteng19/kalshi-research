Donald Trump: I recently read an interesting headline in the paper that said, "The Washington Compost," which is the Washington Post, "Hit with Biden-era layoffs as subscriptions plummet." If they'd cover the news fairly, accurately with a passion for our country, this wouldn't be happening to the Washington Post. People don't want fake news.

Donald Trump: Thank you very much.
