Donald Trump: The fake news media like CNN; "MSDNC," which is sometimes referred to as MSNBC; the "Washington Com-Post," which is sometimes referred to as The Washington Post; and the failing New York Times are doing really, really badly and closing up shop all over the place. CNN is shuttering its longtime headquarters building, and the money-losing Washington Post is being peddled all over to see whether or not somebody wants to buy it. In the meantime, they're firing massive numbers of people.

Donald Trump: Not reporting with credibility has its consequences. The future of the fake news looks bleak, and that's a positive thing. But beware, the Marxists and communists, which are well-represented in our government, many of them got there by fake news, so we have to stop it. We have to get back to normal. Thank you.
