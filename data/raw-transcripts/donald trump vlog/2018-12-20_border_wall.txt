Donald Trump: I'm fighting very hard for border security. So important. I've already started building the wall. We've built large sections, and we're fixing up a lot of other sections that are a mess.

Donald Trump: But the fact is: we need the wall. The Democrats know it. Everybody knows it. It's only a game when they say you don't need the wall. You can look at their eyes and you can say, well they're not telling the truth.

Donald Trump: They want to try and do anything possible to hurt us, because of the fact it's politics. I understand that. I don't even hold it against them, except you should always put your country first, and they're not doing that. They're putting politics first.

Donald Trump: We have to build the wall. It will get built. We're going to complete it. A lot of progress has been made. Watch what happens.
