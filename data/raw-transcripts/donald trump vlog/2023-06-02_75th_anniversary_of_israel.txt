Donald Trump: I want to extend my heartfelt congratulations to all the people of Israel on the 75th anniversary year of your country's founding. The State of Israel is the fulfillment of a dream that endured through generations of hardship and through the bottomless evils of the Holocaust, the dream of a Jewish state in the Jewish homeland.

Donald Trump: Against all odds, the State of Israel was born, and now, more than seven decades later, Israel has not just survived. It has prospered as a blessing of Almighty God to the entire world. As president, it was my honor to be the best friend the people of Israel have ever had in the White House. I withdrew from the horrendous Iran nuclear deal.

Donald Trump: I kept my promise and officially recognized the eternal capital of Israel and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, something that nobody thought was even possible to get. I did more for Israel than any other president probably times 10. And that's OK. We did a great job, and I'm very proud of it. Great people, incredible people, brave people.

Donald Trump: And with the historic Abraham Accords, we even created peace in the Middle East, the most important diplomatic breakthrough in many generations. Once again, to our Israeli friends, congratulations on this joyous occasion. The American people will stand with you always, and so will I. Thank you.
