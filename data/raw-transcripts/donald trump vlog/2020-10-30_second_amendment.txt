Donald Trump: A few issues that I'm always talking about is rebuilding our military. I've done that. $2.5 trillion. But I always mention the Second Amendment, because the Second Amendment -- they want to obliterate it, our opponents. They want to get rid of guns. They want to take away your freedoms, whether it's recreational or safety.

Donald Trump: It's recreational for some, it's safety for some, or it's both. They want to obliterate -- get rid of your Second Amendment. That will never happen with me. To me, it's one of the biggest things. I mentioned it very early. Raising taxes I think is terrible. So many different things -- they don't take care of our vets -- I'm always fighting for our vets, and now what we've done is absolutely amazing for our vets.

Donald Trump: I'm fighting for our military. But they always want to knock out your Second Amendment. Look at Virginia. Look at some of these states where they -- it's constantly under siege. With me as your president, your Second Amendment will not be tampered with. It will not be touched. Go out and vote, and vote early if you can.

Donald Trump: But get out and vote. Thank you. Go to the voting booth, and vote early and in-person. Don't let them take your vote away. The most important election we've ever had. Thank you.
