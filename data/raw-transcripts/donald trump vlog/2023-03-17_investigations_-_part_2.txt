Donald Trump: Our enemies are desperate to stop us because they know that we are the only ones who can stop them, and they know it very strongly. And they're looking at the polls where not me but we are up by so much, they can't even believe it. We won twice, and now, we've got to win a third time. They know that we can defeat them.

Donald Trump: They know that we will defeat them, but they're not coming after me. They're coming after you. I'm just standing in their way, and I always will stand in their way. Thank you very much.
