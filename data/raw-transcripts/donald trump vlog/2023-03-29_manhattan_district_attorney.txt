Donald Trump: Joe Biden wants to pretend he has nothing to do with the Manhattan DA's assault on democracy, when in fact he has stuffed the DA's office with department of injustice people, including one top DOJ operative from D.C., who is actually running the horseface witch hunt. Bragg is a Soros racist in reverse, who is taking his orders from D.C. I beat them twice, doing much better the second time.

Donald Trump: Remember, the DOJ is running the local Manhattan DA's prosecution. They just don't want to have their fingerprints on it. They placed a top person in the office of the district attorney. Nobody knows that, but that's the way it is. They don't want to be known for doing it, but that's what they're doing. And you know what?

Donald Trump: And despite their disinformation campaign, they don't want to run against Trump or against our great record. That's why we're leading in the polls by so much. People are longing for the past where we had a great nation. We had a successful nation. We had a nation and an economy like no one has ever seen before.

Donald Trump: The American people aren't going to take it. Thank you.

Donald Trump: That's what they want again, and that's what they're going to get. 2024 will be the most important election in our history. Thank you very much.
