Donald Trump: The Manhattan DA witch hunt against me is dead, no evidence at all. And it has been conclusively proven, I did absolutely nothing wrong. The evidence against their star witness, however, is overwhelming, an already-disbarred lawyer and convicted felon. The only question left is, will the DA's office sue him for lying and for fraud?

Donald Trump: They should. The SDNY already found him guilty on charges unrelated to Trump and wrote a scathing report. He's responsible for time taken away by the DA and the office of the district attorney on violent crime. That's what they should focus on. We have more violent crime. We have record violent crime, murder, rape, drug dealers all over the place.

Donald Trump: That's what the district attorney of New York should be focused on, not on Donald Trump, who did absolutely nothing wrong. Thank you.
