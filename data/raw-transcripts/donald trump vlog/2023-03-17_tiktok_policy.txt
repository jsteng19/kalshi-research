Donald Trump: Has anybody noticed that everyone wants to go after and destroy TikTok due to China influence and national security? When I wanted to disable TikTok three years ago, I was met with opposition from RINOs, Democrats, and everyone else. They actually went to court in an effort to stop me. Now, they realized I was right and have changed their tune.

Donald Trump: Sadly, I've been right about everything. And you know what? The Democrats know it. The radical left knows it. The communists and the Marxists within our own country know it. They want to turn our country into a communist country, Marxist country. They want to turn our country into something that we're not going to let them have.

Donald Trump: We're not going to let them do it. But we were right on so many fronts, and we're going to be right again because we're going to make America great again.
