Donald Trump: Drain the swamp -- and that's what we're doing. Now when I said it, it sounded very easy, and it was going to happen real fast. I didn't know the swamp was this dirty and this deep. I didn't know about the swamp creatures being as bad as they are.

Donald Trump: They're bad, but nobody can believe what we've been able to do, and I don't really believe anybody else could have done it. Drain the swamp. We're not finished yet, but we're getting really close. Give us four more years.

Donald Trump: Go out and vote. The most important election of a lifetime may be the most important election ever in our country. Go out and vote. Thank you very much. Go to the voting booth, and vote early and in-person. Don't let them take your vote away. The most important election we've ever had. Thank you.
