Donald Trump: Does Joe Biden understand that the reason NATO currently exists loaded up with cash is because President Donald J. Trump insisted that delinquent nations, of which there were many, carry their own weight and pay their fair share? If not, I insisted we will not protect them from the evil empire. We will not do it. The money came pouring in after decades of nonpayment and abuse.

Donald Trump: I haven't heard Joe say "Thank you, President Trump, for the great job you did." Perhaps, I'm just not listening. But the fact is when I was president, I got NATO nations to pay hundreds of billions of dollars into NATO. They were all delinquent, most of them, and it was a disaster. They had no money. The United States was paying for NATO at a level that they have never paid before.

Donald Trump: Now, NATO is stuffed up with cash. Thank you very much, President Trump. Thank you very much.
