Donald Trump: World War III has never been closer than it is right now. We need to clean house of all of the warmongers and America-last globalists in the deep state, the Pentagon, the State Department, and the national security industrial complex. One of the reasons I was the only president in generations who didn't start a war is that I was the only president who rejected the catastrophic advice of many of Washington's generals, bureaucrats, and the so-called diplomats, who only know how to get us into conflict, but they don't know how to get us out.

Donald Trump: For decades, we've had the very same people such as Victoria Nuland and many others just like her obsessed with pushing Ukraine toward NATO, not to mention the State Department support for uprisings in Ukraine. These people have been seeking confrontation for a long time, much like the case in Iraq and other parts of the world that, now, we're teetering on the brink of World War III. And a lot of people don't see it, but I see it, and I've been right about a lot of things.

Donald Trump: They all say, "Trump's been right about everything." None of this excuses in any way the outrageous and horrible invasion of Ukraine one year ago, which would have never happened if I was your president, not even a little chance. But it does mean that, here in America, we need to get rid of the corrupt globalist establishment that has botched every major foreign policy decision for decades.

Donald Trump: And that includes President Biden, whose own people said he's never made a good decision when it comes to looking at other countries and looking at wars. We have to replace them with people who support American interests. Over our four years in the White House, we made incredible progress in putting the America-last contingent aside and bringing the world to peace.

Donald Trump: And now, we're going to complete the mission, the State Department, Pentagon, and national security establishment will be a very different place by the end of my administration. In fact, just into my administration, it'll be a very different place, and it'll get things done just like I did four years ago.

Donald Trump: We never had it so good. We'll also stop the lobbyists and the big defense contractors from going in and pushing our senior military and national security officials toward conflict, only to reward them when they retire with lucrative jobs, getting paid millions and millions of dollars. Take a look at the globalist warmonger donors backing our opponents.

Donald Trump: That's because they're candidates of war. I am the president who delivers peace, and it's peace through strength. There was a reason we had no conflict. There was a reason we didn't get into wars because other countries respected us. I entirely built all right from the beginning, rebuilt our military. It's a big reason for that.

Donald Trump: They didn't want to mess around with the United States. And now, they're laughing at us. We could end the Ukraine conflict in 24 hours with the right leadership. At the end of my next four years, the warmongers and frauds and failures of the senior ranks of our government will all be gone. And we will have a new group of competent national security officials who believe in defending America's vital interests above all else.

Donald Trump: Thank you very much.
