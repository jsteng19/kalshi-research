Donald Trump: When I got elected, you had some people that said, this is going to be the greatest thing to ever happen to our country. I guess that's why I won. We had a lot of people.

Donald Trump: But you had others that say, oh the market will collapse. Lots of bad things will happen. And take a look at what's happened. We have the greatest, longest, bull market in the history of our country.

Donald Trump: They turned out to be wrong. Some have actually apologized, but very, very few. I think the rest will soon be apologizing, because, honestly, the American public demands an apology.

Donald Trump: We are doing better financially as a country than we've ever done before.
