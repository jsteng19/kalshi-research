Donald Trump: This is a big moment in our history, because we're opening up our country again. People are coming out. They're starting to go around and see what's happening. They've been sort of shut down, as the expression goes.

Donald Trump: But we're opening up our country. People want our country to open up. Now, we want to do it in a safe way. We want to make sure safety -- you know all about social, distancing and washing your hands and all of the things that we're supposed to do -- and something I think that's important to say, because I've been OK at this kind of thing -- our economy. It's going to come back very, very strong.

Donald Trump: You know, we built the greatest economy anywhere in the world. Nobody even close. Greater than China by far, greater than anybody. Nobody was even close. I did it once. We're gonna do it again, and it's gonna be just as strong, by the time we have it done, and it's gonna be a lot sooner than anybody would understand. We're gonna have an incredible next year, and I look forward to it.
