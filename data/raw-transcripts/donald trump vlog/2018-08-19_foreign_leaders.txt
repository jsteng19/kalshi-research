Donald Trump: Many people have asked me: why do I meet with foreign leaders? Why do I even waste my time? The fact is, it's very important. I've said for a long time, if you're President, you should meet with foreign leaders. You have nothing to lose, and you have a lot to gain.

Donald Trump: You look at what happened in Singapore. You look at what happened with Chairman Kim and all that's taken place. We have the remains back of our great heroes that were lost so many years ago. We have nobody shooting out missiles and nuclear testing and other things that were going on that were terrible.

Donald Trump: We had a tremendous meeting with President Putin. A lot of things were accomplished. Meeting with foreign leaders is a good thing, not a bad thing. Nothing bad can happen. It's only going to be positive, especially if your President knows what he's doing.
