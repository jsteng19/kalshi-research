Donald Trump: Polls show me doing substantially better against Hopeless Joe Biden than Ron Desanctimonious would do. In fact, he doesn't even come close to winning. An early forerunner would be the 2020 election, where I did much better than in 2016, getting more votes than any sitting president in the history of our country.

Donald Trump: That election, however, was rigged. They used the China virus, the FBI Twitter, and ballot stuffing in order to cheat. Good Republicans won't let that happen again. We cannot let it happen again.
