Donald Trump: All Republican governors should immediately pull out of ERIC, the terrible voter registration system that pumps up the rolls for Democrats and does absolutely nothing to clean up those rolls. It's a fool's game for Republicans. It cannot be overstated just how bad ERIC truly is. Republican governors who keep participating should be ashamed of themselves.

Donald Trump: You can't win with this system. And while these governors are at it, go to same-day voting, all paper ballots, and voter ID, that's voter identification. Our problems on elections have just been solved. Thank you.
