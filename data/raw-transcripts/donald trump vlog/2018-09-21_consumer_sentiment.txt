Donald Trump: Consumer sentiment hit its highest level in 17 years. That's something very important to me. Consumer sentiment is like the spirit that people have for investing, and for the country, and for what they're going to buy. It means a lot about jobs. It means a lot about everything.

Donald Trump: During the past administration, it went down very substantially in 2015. So we're happy about it. We're on our way to a very, very special period in our country's life. When consumer sentiment goes up, that means people are feeling really good.
