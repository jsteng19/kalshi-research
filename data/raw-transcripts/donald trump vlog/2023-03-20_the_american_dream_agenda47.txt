Donald Trump: Joe Biden recently announced that he will require every state, county, city, and town to submit so-called equity plans to impose the left's Marxist housing agenda on your communities. This is not what we need. The Biden power grab will put radical and racist left wing bureaucrats in charge of micromanaging the housing where you live, and nobody can be happy about that.

Donald Trump: I talked about it during my last campaign, and people understood it very well. They will use the power of the federal government to abolish zoning for single-family homes, destroy your property values by building giant multifamily apartment complexes in the suburbs and even next to your house, and force your community to pay for low-income housing developments right next door.

Donald Trump: The woke left is waging full scale war on the suburbs, and their Marxist crusade is coming for your neighborhood, your tax dollars, your public safety, and your home. When I get back into the Oval Office, one of my first acts will be to repeal Joe Biden's radical-left attack on the suburban lifestyle, just as I blew up Barack Obama's leftist housing monstrosity just a few years ago.

Donald Trump: And I blew it up. The Biden war on the suburbs will be over, and it will never happen again. That whole mess will never ever happen again. We pray for our country. Thank you.
