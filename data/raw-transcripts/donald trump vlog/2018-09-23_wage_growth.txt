Donald Trump: On the campaign trail, I used to always talk about the fact that wages weren't going up for people. They were down from 20 years ago, and people had one job. Now they were working two and three jobs, and they were making less money.

Donald Trump: Well, I have good news for you. It was just announced that wages, for the first time in many years, for people in the United States, have gone up. I'm so happy about that. That means you're working hard, but you're, making more money, and that's going to continue. So, congratulations. Spend your money well.
