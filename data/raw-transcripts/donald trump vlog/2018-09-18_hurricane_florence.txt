Donald Trump: I just want to thank all of the incredible men and women who have done such a great job in helping with Florence. This is a tough hurricane. One of the wettest we've ever seen, from the standpoint of water. Rarely have we had an experience like it. And it certainly is not good.

Donald Trump: But the people of North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia -- all of the areas affected -- you've been incredible. There's been a loss of life, and may God be with them and their families. That's a tough one. It's tough to understand.

Donald Trump: But this has been a really difficult period of time for a lot of people. FEMA, the job you've done, the military, Coast Guard, what you've done in saving so many lives has been really something special. Law enforcement always -- again, I just want to thank everybody for doing such a great job with a very difficult situation.

Donald Trump: Florence has been a nasty one, a big one like that area certainly has never seen before. So the waters are still rising. Listen to your state and local authorities. Be patient, be alert, and God bless you.
