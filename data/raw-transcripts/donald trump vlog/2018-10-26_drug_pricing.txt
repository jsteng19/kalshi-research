Donald Trump: Very important for our great people to find out what prescription drugs are costing. I ended the gag rule where people were not allowed to discuss price, meaning pharmacies, they couldn't discuss price with people and tell them they had better alternatives at a lower price. We just ended that practice. It's ridiculous.

Donald Trump: We're driving down drug prices, the first time in many years. As you know, I called up a number of big drug companies: Novartis, Pfizer, others. They raised their prices. I talked to them. They all brought them back down, and now they're going to go lower than that.

Donald Trump: We're getting our prices for drugs way down. Lots of different things we're doing. A little bit of controversy. I wouldn't say the drug companies will love me in the end. But our prescription drugs are coming down. Everybody sees it. It's happening fast.
