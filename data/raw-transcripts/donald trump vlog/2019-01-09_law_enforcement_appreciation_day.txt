Donald Trump: This is Law Enforcement Appreciation Day, and nobody appreciates you more than the President of the United States. Everybody knows what you do, and everybody cares.

Donald Trump: Without you, it just couldn't be the same. It would be really bad. So, again, thank you and have a great Law Enforcement Appreciation Day.
