Donald Trump: For a long time, I've been hearing about how powerful big tech is. Whether it's Facebook, or Twitter, or Google, or any of 'em -- big tech --  and I heard about it for a long time -- and then I ran, and I won, and they were totally against me, and I said, "Why are they powerful?" But now they've taken it to a new level. What they're doing now is incredible.

Donald Trump: As an example, they're suppressing the corruption of Joe Biden. They -- suppressing it. They won't let the stories out. Whether you like it or don't like it, they won't even let the stories go out, and the evidence is very strong. Very, very powerful. Big tech has to be spoken to, and probably in some form, has to be stopped, because they're taking away your rights.

Donald Trump: They're taking away things that nobody would have believed possible. So one of the things we're doing -- you saw what happened with Google, with the lawsuit -- one of the things we're doing is looking very powerfully and strongly at big tech.

Donald Trump: Go out and vote. Go to the voting booth and vote early, and in-person. Don't let them take your vote away. The most important election we've ever had. Thank you.
