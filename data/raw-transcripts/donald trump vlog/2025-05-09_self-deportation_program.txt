Donald Trump: Today, I signed an executive order to launch the first-ever self-deportation program for illegal aliens. We are making it as easy as possible for illegal aliens to leave America. Any illegal alien can simply show up at an airport and receive a free flight out of our country. We have also launched a phone app called CBP Home -- that's CBP Home -- where illegals can book a free flight to any foreign country. As long as it's not here, you can go anywhere you want.

Donald Trump: We're also adding a very important exit bonus for illegals to further incentivize their self-deportation. This deportation bonus will save American taxpayers billions and billions of dollars. What Biden did to this country can never be explained, will never, ever be accepted.

Donald Trump: Eventually, when the illegals are gone, it will save us trillions of dollars. However, if illegal aliens choose to remain in America, they're remaining illegally, and they will face severe consequences. Illegal aliens who stay in America face punishments including significant jail time, enormous financial penalties, confiscation of all property, garnishment of all wages, imprisonment and incarceration, and sudden deportation in a place and manner solely of our discretion.

Donald Trump: So to all illegal aliens: book your free flight right now. We want you out of America. But if you're really good, we're going to try and help you get back in. Thank you.
