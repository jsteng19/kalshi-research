Alina Habba: Good morning. I'm sure you've seen President Trump has just put out a statement that he has appointed me as the interim US attorney for the state of New Jersey, my home state. Um, as you know I've stood by President Trump, his family, the organization and many other clients in that state where I've been born and raised and I'm raising my babies now.

Alina Habba: But there is corruption, there is injustice and there is a heavy amount of crime right in Cory Booker's backyard and right under Governor Murphy and that will stop. I look forward to working with Pam Bondi, with the Department of Justice and making sure that we further the president's agenda of putting America first, cleaning up the mess and going after the people that we should be going after, not the people that are falsely accused.

Alina Habba: That will stop in the great state of New Jersey starting now. Thank you so much.

Question: Who are the people you want to go after?

Alina Habba: We'll see when I get in there, we got to see what's going in.

Question: [Inaudible].

Alina Habba: I didn't actually.

Question: You mentioned politicians ?

Alina Habba: I didn?t actually.

Question: You said Cory Booker and Governor Murphy.

Alina Habba: Correct, because I think Cory Booker and Governor Murphy have failed the state of New Jersey. Did you look at what happened in crime, what's going on in Newark, what's going on in Camden? This has been a neglected state. It is one of the most populated states for its size and it needs to stop. We're going to do a bang up job.

Alina Habba: I cannot wait, it's a great honor.

Question: How long is your appointment?

Alina Habba: Thank you very much.

Note: [Crosstalk]

Question: Alina, do you have any more information on this US attorney who died? And if she died of natural causes?

Alina Habba: No, I do not at this time, but I do pray for her family and I hope she rest in peace. That was tragic.
