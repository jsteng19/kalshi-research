Question: Mr. Homan and Secretary Noem, can we ask you a few questions here, please? Would you guys gaggle with reporters for a few moments? Thank you. Thank you.

Kristi Noem: You are both the top immigration advisors to President Trump in addition to Stephen Miller. He just announced that he's signing an executive order to -- to put 30,000 detention beds at Guantanamo Bay. I know, Mr. Homan, you've talked about needing more beds, but how exactly would that work, and when do you expect it to open?

Kristi Noem: You know that is something that the White House is working on to use resources that we currently have there at Guantanamo Bay. So, we'll go through the process. The worst of the worst is where that could be utilized. So, that potential is there. We know we need the infrastructure. Um, we're going after these guys.

Question: But who would run that, DHS? DHS or the Pentagon.

Tom Homan: Wait, wait, wait. What you probably don't know, there's already a migrant center there. It's been there for decades. So, we're just going to expand upon the existing migrant center.

Question: How would logistics work for that? How would you get migrants down to Guantanamo Bay?

Tom Homan: We fly them. We fly them to Guantanamo. Coast Guard, they encounter people in maritime. They can take them straight to Guantanamo Bay, the worst of the worst, the significant public safety threats we can find. We fly --

Question: Mr. Homan what kind of -- Secretary Noem, what kind of civilian oversight would there be?

Kristi Noem: Civilian oversight?

Question: Yeah.

Kristi Noem: The current civilian oversight that we have in our federal government today. We had an election in November that clearly said the American people don't want these criminals and dangerous individuals on our streets anymore. We're taking care of it at the direction of the president.

Question: What's your message for Polish Americans who voted for President Trump and may have neighbors or family members who are undocumented who are illegally here?

Kristi Noem: Listen, the law applies to everybody. It applies to American citizens. It applies to people who come into this country illegally. You will be held accountable for breaking our laws.

Question: -- relations at all --

Question: Go ahead, Mr. Homan.

Tom Homan: ICE has the highest detention standards in the industry. You can't find another state, federal or local city that has higher detention standards than ICE. So, every facility including, GTMO, will have the highest --

Question: So, ICE would be running it? That's -- that's actually really helpful. So, ICE would be running and would be staffing that.

Question: We're covering that and this.

Question: In the facility at Guantanamo Bay that the president announced?

Kristi Noem: We're working on that with reconciliation and appropriators in the House.
