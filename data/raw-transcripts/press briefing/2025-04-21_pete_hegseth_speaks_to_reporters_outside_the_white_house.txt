Question: -- [Inaudible] sir, about the signal chat controversy?

Pete Hegseth: You know, what a big surprise that a few leakers get fired and suddenly a bunch of hit pieces come out from the same media that peddled the Russia hoax. Won't get back their Pulitzers. They got Pulitzers for a bunch of lies. Pulitzers for a bunch of lies, and on hoaxes time and time and time again. And as they peddle those lies, no one ever calls them on it. See, this is what the media does.

Pete Hegseth: They take anonymous sources from disgruntled former employees and then they try to slash and burn people and ruin their reputations. Not going to work with me because we're changing the Defense Department, putting the Pentagon back in the hands of warfighters and anonymous smears from disgruntled former employees on old news doesn't matter.

Pete Hegseth: So I'm happy to be here at the Easter Egg Roll with my dad and my kids, because this is what we're doing it for, these kids right here. This is why we're fighting the fake news media. This is why we're fighting slash and burn Democrats. This is why we're fighting hoaxsters, hoaxsters. This group -- No, no, this group right here, full of hoaxsters that peddle anonymous sources from leakers with axes to grind and then you put it all together as if it's some news story, and we know it. We know exactly what it is. So I'm really proud of what we're doing for the president, fighting hard across the board and I'm going to go roll some Easter eggs with my kids.

Pete Hegseth: Thank you very much. Thank you.

Question: Sir, have you spoken with the president?

Pete Hegseth: We have spoken to the president and we are going to continue fighting on the same page all the way. Come on, guys.

Aide: All right. We're moving, everyone. Let's go.
