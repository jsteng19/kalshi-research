Stephen Miller: But before we get started, I'm only going to do five minutes because we had a whole press

Note: [Crosstalk]

Question: Stephen, can you just give us a sense of how long is this temporary pause on federal funding? How long is this pause going to last?

Stephen Miller: Well, by the terms of the executive order, it's 90 days. But it's important to understand that it's a -- it's a review process to say that there's -- for discretionary spending, it's not directed by Congress or required by law. So, this would be for example something like a contract to a non-governmental organization to teach, say, critical race theory that there has to be a politically appointed individual in the departments or agencies who simply reviews and approves the expenditure, so that we have control, Democratic control, over the operations of government.

Stephen Miller: This doesn't affect any federal programs that Americans rely on, full stop.

Note: [Crosstalk]

Question: It doesn't -- It's not going to have any impact on any Americans and what they rely on?

Stephen Miller: Any program, like a benefit program that Americans rely on --

Question: Like Meals on Wheels?

Stephen Miller: Correct. It has no, the -- the OMB guidance document, which I think you're referring to, because the executive order was issued a week ago. It just gives clarity on how to implement the original executive order, which doesn't cover any entitlement or public benefit spending at all. And that's clear by the way, if you read, as I'm sure you have, the OMB guidance document.

Stephen Miller: Hold on. Hold on, I'm getting a question --

Note: [Crosstalk]

Question: -- ask you about El Salvador? So, we know that the president spoke to President Bukele, next week, Secretary Rubio will be in El Salvador. Should we be expecting El Salvador to take the Tren de Aragua Venezuelans as an agreement between the two countries?

Stephen Miller: All I can say on this, because I don't want to get ahead of Senator Rubio, is that the President Bukele has graciously offered tremendous degrees of cooperation with the United States on all things migration. And we're hoping that will provide a framework for migration cooperation all throughout the region.

Stephen Miller: And I think it's very clear that President Bukele is going to be a very great and strong partner for this administration and for the United States.

Note: [Crosstalk]

Question: And how --

Note: [Crosstalk]

Question: -- to El Salvador, because I mean right now we don't have relationships with Venezuela.

Stephen Miller: We're -- it is our -- it is our full expectation that Maduro will accept all flights of TDA gang members back to Venezuela. Yes?

Note: [Crosstalk]

Question: Is the Trump immigration method applicable to Europe? Europe has a huge immigration problem. Is that method of deportation, repatriation, applicable to the continent of Europe?

Stephen Miller: If I understand your question correctly, you're asking should Europe consider mirroring our own policies?

Question: Absolutely.

Stephen Miller: Yes, absolutely. Yes.

Question: How?

Stephen Miller: Well, I mean it's simple. I mean, you have to establish a policy that says that anyone who crosses the border is going to be immediately repatriated, that anyone in the country legally is subject to removal, of course, prioritizing public safety and national security as well as, as we've done, is a general matter, suspending refugee resettlement, which of course poses enormous burdens on local communities and populations.

Note: [Crosstalk]

Question: Just on the tariffs --

Note: [Crosstalk]

Question: -- administration needs with countries from South America, as Brazil for example, in this -- in this -- in this deportation flights?

Stephen Miller: Oh, deeply engaged. So, look, it's the president's expectation that countries all across the world participate fully in the enforcement of immigration laws and in particular in the repatriation of their own citizens. This is a basic international obligation. The United States abides by, all developed nations abide by, and we expect all of the partner nations all throughout the region to abide by as well.

Stephen Miller: And we've had incredibly productive conversations with, frankly, nations all across Latin America, led by Secretary of State Rubio, who, if I may say, has done an absolutely fabulous job.

Note: [Crosstalk]

Question: You know -- will take TDA members.

Note: [Crosstalk]

Question: -- that are supposed to take effect on, or to be announced on February 1. Can you just walk us through how you expect that to happen? The president has talked about 25 percent on Mexico.

Stephen Miller: I don't want to get ahead of the president. I will let him speak for himself on any tariff announcements. The bottom line is that the United States is going to have a trade policy that brings our manufacturing jobs back and that doesn't allow any other countries to exploit us.

Note: [Crosstalk]

Question: Can you tell us about Canada please?

Note: [Crosstalk]

Question: Can you just -- can you give us a --

Stephen Miller: I just want to be clear, because I don't want -- I don't want to step on up on Karoline's briefing. So I'm going to -- I'll do three more questions of this being the first of the three.

Note: [Crosstalk]

Question: Do you expect those tariffs --

Stephen Miller: Hold on -- let me -- Yes?

Question: Do you expect the tariffs to take effect immediately?

Stephen Miller: So, this --

Question: I want to defer to Andrea just because --

Stephen Miller: Well, no, I don't have anything else to add to that. So, I just wanted to go here --

Question: All right, my question is on first, can you give us a sense, an exact figure, of how many people have been brought up in the ICE raid so far? And how many are you expecting to do?

Stephen Miller: Well, ICE has published the daily numbers. I just did an interview with Jake Tapper and he talked about the new targets that have been set, which is really a floor. I mean, you know, to put this in perspective, um, I think in Biden's worst month in office, uh, there was almost 350,000 apprehensions at the southwest border.

Stephen Miller: So, it gives you a sense of the scale of work that we have to do here. So, we're going to continue to set ever more ambitious targets. But again, we're going to really focus in on public safety threats, understanding that you can't have a situation as a nation where, say in Biden's last month in office, if he releases 100,000 illegals into the country, they just all get to stay here for life, forever, because they came in, in December of 2020 and now it's a lifetime pass?

Stephen Miller: I mean, of course, you can't have a nation run that way.

Note: [Crosstalk]

Stephen Miller: We're going to focus on public safety, national security. All right, a few more questions.

Note: [Crosstalk]

Question: -- the Egyptian media -- the Egyptian media, today quoted a senior official that there was no call between President Trump and President Sisi. The president yesterday said on Air Force One that he has spoken to Sisi and asked him to take some of the population of Gaza.

Stephen Miller: Yeah, President -- President Trump is correct, but any more questions on this, I want to refer to Mike Waltz. All right, last question.

Note: [Crosstalk]

Question: Would you be willing to preview the EOs that we should expect for the rest of the week?

Stephen Miller: I would love to, but I will let the comms and press team do that. I want to thank you all for your time and I look forward to seeing you very soon.

Note: [Crosstalk]

Question: Can you tell us if WIC will be -- Thank you. Can you just tell us if WIC will be impacted? WIC, yes or no? Will it be --

Note: [Crosstalk]

Stephen Miller: No, no public benefit programs.

Question: OK, thank you.
