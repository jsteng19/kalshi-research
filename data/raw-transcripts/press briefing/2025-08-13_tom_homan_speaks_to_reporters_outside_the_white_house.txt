Question: We've got a microphone ready for you.

Tom Homan: Of course, you do.

Question: Yes. What are the odds? Yeah.

Tom Homan: What's up?

Question: Can we ask about the crime crackdown so far, how you've seen it go in the first 48 hours, if you will? And also, what are we looking at in terms of next steps?

Tom Homan: Look, I know they've taken some bad people off the street, but in addition to that, I think it sends a strong message of consequences -- I mean deterrence. I mean, a lot of the criminals are staying off the street because they know there's an increased presence of law enforcement that are going to take zero tolerance.

Tom Homan: Zero tolerance on criminal activity in DC, as the president said. So, I think it works both ways. Number one, taking bad guys off the street, actually arresting some folks. Second of all, the deterrence message is keeping people off the street from doing violent things because they know there's an uptick in law enforcement.

Question: Do you fear though that if the time frame is set that, after 30 days, hey, our authority's over, that then these criminals that took themselves off the streets might come right back?

Tom Homan: The president's authority is never over. The president's going to do what he has to do to make this country safe again in every city in this nation. Anything else? That was easy. Thanks, folks.
