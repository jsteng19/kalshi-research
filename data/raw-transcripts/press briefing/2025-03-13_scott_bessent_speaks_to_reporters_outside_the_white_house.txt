Question: Do you have time for one question?

Note: [Crosstalk]

Question: Ed O'Keefe. Mr. Secretary, uh thank you for stopping by. Given, uh, the volatility of the markets, given the threatened back and forth, how are these tariffs good for the economy?

Scott Bessent: Well, look, the -- uh, I'm less concerned about the short term, I think we've had a big unwind and the tariffs -- we've got strategic industries we've got to have. We want to protect the American worker that a lot of these trade deals haven't been fair. But I can tell you, what's not good for the economy is this government shutdown.

Scott Bessent: I don't know what Democrats are thinking here because they're going to own it and to the extent that it hurts confidence, hurts the American people, uh, we have had incredible Republican unity this since January 20 and the fact that the Democrats are in disarray, they're flailing, and this is the best they can do that I think this is the economic story for the next few days.

Question: Not the tariffs?

Scott Bessent: Not the tariffs. Not for the next few days. If they want to take us into a shutdown, they're going to own it.
