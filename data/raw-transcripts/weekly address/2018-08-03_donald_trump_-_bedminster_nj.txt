Donald Trump: My Administration is committed to giving every American the opportunity to find a great job and have a rewarding career -- there's nothing like it.

Donald Trump: Whether you are a high school student -- or a late-career worker -- there has never been a better time to learn a trade, hone a skill, and pursue your dreams.

Donald Trump: Last quarter, the United States economy grew by 4.1 percent. We've created 3.7 million new jobs since the election. Unemployment recently fell to its lowest rate in almost 50 years. Unemployment for Americans with disabilities has reached the lowest level ever recorded.  In the month of June alone, 600,000 workers entered or reentered the workforce. Pretty good numbers.

Donald Trump: To continue this incredible momentum, we launched the Pledge to America's Workers. More than 100 companies, associations and others have pledged to train or retrain over 4 million American students.

Donald Trump: We are encouraging companies across the country to join our historic initiative, and pledge to invest in training Americans for the jobs of today and the careers of tomorrow.

Donald Trump: In the last two weeks, I established the National Council for the American Worker, which will develop a national workforce strategy, and signed the modernized -- and long-awaited -- Perkins Career and Technical Education Act, which will deliver jobs and training to more than 11 million students and workers. We are very proud of that.

Donald Trump: When we invest in our workers, we are investing in our people -- we are investing in our communities-- and we are investing in the American Dream. And every single day, we are making new American Dreams come true.

Donald Trump: Thank you. And God bless America.
