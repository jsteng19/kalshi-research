Donald Trump: My fellow Americans. This Sunday is one of the most important days of the year: Mother's Day. It's a special opportunity to thank all of the mothers and grandmothers in our lives.

Donald Trump: Since the earliest days of our republic, America's strength has come from the love and courage and devotion of our mothers. They helped us gain our independence. Through their grit, determination, and incredible spirit, they pioneered the West and settled the frontier.

Donald Trump: During World War II, America's mothers helped build the greatest arsenal for democracy.

Donald Trump: My mother was a great person. Her name was Mary MacLeod. She came from Scotland, and she met my father when she was very young.

Donald Trump: They were married for many, many years. I learned so much from my mother. She was just incredible. Warm, loving, really smart, could be tough if she had to be, but basically she was a really nice person.

Donald Trump: So much of what I've done, and so much of what I've become, is because of my mother. I miss her a lot. So I say this to you as I think about my mother. Happy Mother's Day, and God bless the United States of America.
