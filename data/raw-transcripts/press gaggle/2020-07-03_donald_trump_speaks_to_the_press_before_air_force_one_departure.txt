Donald Trump: Okay, thank you very much. We're going to Mount Rushmore. Mount Rushmore is in great shape, and it's going to be in great shape for centuries to come. We are looking forward to it. I'll be making a speech there. I'll be seeing a lot of people, a lot of different people, and I think it'll be a fantastic evening.

Donald Trump: The economy is doing very well. Our job numbers was the biggest number in history, in the history of our country, bigger even than last month, by almost double. So a lot of good things are happening. A lot of very powerful things are happening, and our country is doing very well.

Donald Trump: I think we will have a v-shape, if you look at what's going on. If you look at the numbers all over, I think we're going to have a very strong v-shape, and I will see you on the airplane. Thank you. I'll see you in the airplane. Thank you.
