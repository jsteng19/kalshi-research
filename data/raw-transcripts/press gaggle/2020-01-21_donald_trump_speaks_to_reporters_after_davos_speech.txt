Question: With the impeachment hearings under way, why is it better to be here in Davos than in Washington D.C.?

Donald Trump: Well, we're here meeting were the world leaders. The biggest, most important people in the world, and we're bringing back tremendous business to the United States, and they're all here to see -- I'll, be making a speech, and then we'll be leaving in shortly. But I think it's very important. The other is just a hoax.

Donald Trump: It's the witch hunt that's been going on for years, and it's -- frankly, it's disgraceful. But we look forward to being here. Klaus has done a fantastic job, and again, we're meeting with the big -- biggest companies in the world, the biggest businesses in the world and world leaders, all for the benefit of the United States. We look forward to the meetings.

Question: [Inaudible] climate change, Mr. President?

Donald Trump: Oh, I'm a big believer in the environment. The environment to me is very important. Thank you.
