Question: [Inaudible, about the shooting at a synagogue in San Diego]

Donald Trump: I do. My deepest sympathies go to the people that were affected -- the families, their loved ones -- by the, obviously -- looks right now, based on my last conversations -- looks like a hate crime. Hard to believe. Hard to believe, with respect to the synagogue in California near San Diego, and we're doing some very heavy research.

Donald Trump: We'll see what happens, what comes up. At this moment, it looks like a hate crime. But my deepest sympathies to all of those affected. And we'll get to the bottom of it. It looks like the person was apprehended. No more danger, and law enforcement has done a fantastic job. Fantastic job. I'm headed out to Wisconsin right now.

Donald Trump: We have a lot of people, and they've been lined up for a day already, and I look forward to that. I just left, as you probably know, I just left with Prime Minister Abe of Japan. We had great talks. This morning, we played a very fast round of golf, we had a meeting afterwards, and it looks like it's doing well Our trade deal, our relationship, our military ties -- Japan has agreed to buy a tremendous amount of military equipment, I mean they're buying the best you can buy.

Donald Trump: We make the best, and they're buying the best. Our trade relationship with Japan is very good. There's been some weaknesses there, for many years, and we're getting those weaknesses straightened out. And again, my deepest sympathies to the people, the families, everybody affected by the shooting at the synagogue in California. Thank you very much.
