Donald Trump: [Inaudible] So we're going over and I'll see you in a little while. I hope -- are you enjoying it? You are. I don't know about them, but you are. Thank you. Thank you everybody.  And we're doing well -- I hear we're doing great in Florida, doing great in Ohio.

Donald Trump: Doing really well in Georgia, doing really well in Texas, and I think we're doing terrific in North Carolina. I hear -- [Inaudible] now, these aren't polls. These are what's happening. But I think we're doing very well. I'll see you over there.
