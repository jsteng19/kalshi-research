Donald Trump: Well, we had 25,000 people coming. We tried to get them not to come, and we have a group over there that we're going to take care of. But these were -- there are thousands of people -- look over there -- thousands of people, all because the governor wants to play games. The governor wants to play games.

Donald Trump: He's a weak governor who's done a terrible job. He doesn't know what the hell he's doing. You've got thousands of people that are injured by this. They spent hours and hours, maybe even days, a couple of days -- you got 25,000 people. It's a disgrace. So we're going to go back and speak to 250 people, but I wanted to say hello to some of the people that came.

Donald Trump: You have cars that are three miles long. It's a shame what the governor did, and that's why they're going to lose Minnesota, just like he did with Minneapolis, where they didn't know what they were doing. They're going to lose Minnesota. We're going to win Minnesota, but this should be a lesson. He wants to silence people. This should be a lesson. The governor doesn't know what he's doing.
