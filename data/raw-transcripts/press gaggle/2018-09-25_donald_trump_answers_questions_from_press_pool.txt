Question: [Inaudible, about Iran]

Donald Trump: Iran has acted very badly. We are doing many things right now, including sanctions at a very massive level. One of the highest levels we've ever done. Iran has to change its tune before I meet with them.

Donald Trump: They want to meet. I'm not meeting with them until they change their tune. It will happen. I believe they have no choice. We look forward to having a great relationship with Iran. But it won't happen now.

Question: [Inaudible, about North Korea]

Donald Trump: We're in the process of setting up a meeting with North Korea, Chairman Kim has been dealing with us, and we have made tremendous progress -- far greater than the media would understand or know. It has been, really, a very good relationship.

Donald Trump: As you know, there have been no tests, no nuclear tests, no rockets, no missile launches, and we got our hostages back. We're getting the remains of our great heroes back, and that's already started, that process and many more are coming in the very short future.

Donald Trump: So we're doing very well with North Korea. Again, far greater than anybody would know. I have much personal correspondence with Chairman Kim, and we will, I think, we'll do something that's good for Chairman Kim, and good for North Korea, and also good for the rest of the world.

Question: [Inaudible, about Rod Rosenstein]

Donald Trump: I'm meeting with Rod Rosenstein on Thursday. Today, I'm doing other things, as you probably agree.

Question: [Inaudible, about Venezuela]

Donald Trump: Venezuela is a very sad case, and we want to see it fixed. What's happening there is a human tragedy, okay?
