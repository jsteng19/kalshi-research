Donald Trump: This was a disgrace. This was a rigged trial by a conflicted judge who was corrupt. It was a rigged trial, a disgrace. They wouldn't give us a venue change. We were at 5% or 6% in this district, in this area. This was a rigged, disgraceful trial. But the real verdict is going to be November 5th by the people.

Donald Trump: And they know what happened here, and everybody knows what happened here. You have a Soros-backed DA. And the whole thing -- we didn't do a thing wrong. I'm a very innocent man. And it's OK. I'm fighting for our country. I'm fighting for our constitution. Our whole country is being rigged right now. This was done by the Biden administration in order to wound or hurt an opponent, a political opponent.

Donald Trump: And I think it's just a disgrace, and we'll keep fighting. We'll fight till the end, and we'll win because our country has gone to hell. We don't have the same country anymore. We have a divided mess. Where a nation in decline, serious decline. Millions and millions of people pouring into our country right now from prisons and from mental institutions, terrorists, and they're taking over our country.

Donald Trump: We have a country that's in big trouble. But this was a rigged decision right from day one with a conflicted judge who should have never been allowed to try this case, never. And we will fight for our constitution. This is long from over. Thank you very much.
