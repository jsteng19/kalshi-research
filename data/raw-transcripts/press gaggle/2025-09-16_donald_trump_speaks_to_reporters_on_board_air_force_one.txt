Note: [Begins in progress. Audio missed the initial question.]

Donald Trump: He said a few words -- [Inaudible] --

Note: [A reporter nods affirmatively]

Donald Trump: That -- I think it's going to be a very big thing [Inaudible] -- hello, Brian -- I told him yesterday, we took down the tent. That tent's been up for three years. I didn't know that.

Question: [Inaudible] since 1978.

Donald Trump: Since nineteen seventy -- ? You should have told me sooner. I would have taken it down. But we got it down, after you said -- 24 hours it was down. And they had a lot of permits, but they weren't current. So we got it down.

Donald Trump: Enjoy yourselves, right? You're gonna have some great pictures today. You're gonna -- you're gonna have the best pictures, Doug. It's going to be a beautiful event. Everyone's looking forward to it. I would just relax and have a good time. Country's doing well. Stock market's setting all sorts of records.

Donald Trump: And I think, uh, there's never been a time like this. We had a horrible tragedy, but, we're gonna have to do something about that. We can't let that happen. So I'll be going to the service on Sunday, coming back, and then that we're going -- and I guess a lot of you coming out with us.

Donald Trump: So enjoy yourselves, okay? It's great to have you. Thank you.

Question: Thank you.

Donald Trump: Thank you.
