Note: [Donald Trump spoke with the press aboard Air Force One on the return flight from Kennedy Space Center to Joint Base Andrews. The discussion was off-the-record, which is not uncommon.]

Note: [Some of the comments were retroactively put on the record, which also is not uncommon. However, the White House has not released a recording or a transcript of these comments. Only select quotes were made available via the pool. It is not the pool's responsibility to transcribe, but is normally the responsibility of the White House Press Office.]

Note: [We are capturing that these on-the-record comments took place, but as of now, do not have a transcript to provide.]
