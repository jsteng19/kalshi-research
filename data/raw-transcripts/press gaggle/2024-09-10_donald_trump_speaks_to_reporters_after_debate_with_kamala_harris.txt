Question: Would you do another debate? Would you do another debate? Mr. President, [Inaudible] the Vice President Kamala Harris. What do you respond?

Donald Trump: [Inaudible] my best debate ever I think. And we had a -- it was very interesting. It showed how weak they are, how pathetic they are, and what they're doing to destroy our country and the border with foreign trade, with everything. And I think it was the best debate I've ever personally that I've had.

Donald Trump: We're getting polls that show 92 to six, 88 to 11. So, we're having a lot of great polls that just came out there. Polls, I guess, phone calls and lots of other polls, but you see the polls, a very important debate. Now, she wants to do another one because she got beaten tonight, but I don't know.

Question: Why wouldn't you look at her? Why won't you look at her? Mr. President --

Donald Trump: The polls are indicating that we got 90%, 60%, 72%, 71%, and 89%.

Question: Where are you getting these numbers?

Donald Trump: So, the polls are very good. Beyond the polls, I felt very good. I had a good time doing it. I hate to speak about our country so negatively, but that's what happened. They've ruined our country. They've destroyed our country. So, I hope you're all having a good time, but it was a very interesting -- yes?

Question: Did she get under your [Crosstalk] [Inaudible] that you won tonight, why are you here? Why not let the performance speak for itself?

Donald Trump: Well, I think it did, but people said, would I come here? And I made an obligation to a couple of people, I'm going to do their show. But it was a --

Question: What about the moderators?

Donald Trump: I thought it was a great night. [Crosstalk]

Question: What is your reaction to Taylor Swift's endorsement?

Donald Trump: Go ahead.

Question: What is your reaction to Taylor Swift's endorsement of Kamala Harris?

Donald Trump: I have no idea.

Question: Mr. President, why didn't you look at her? Will you debate Harris again? Mr. President, when Republicans are complaining about moderators, does that mean that it wasn't a good night, that you were not prepared?

Donald Trump: No, I think the moderators were very unfair, but basically, it was three on one. And -- but I thought they were very unfair, the moderators. Everybody did. But despite that, they're saying that the debate was [Inaudible]. [Crosstalk] Yeah. I assume the moderators would be bad because that right there is the worst of all the news networks in my opinion. And it always has been. Yeah.

Question: Will you debate her again, Mr. President? [Crosstalk]

Donald Trump: Well, she wants a second debate because she lost tonight very badly, so they want -- they immediately called for a second debate because they lost. So, we'll, you know, think about that, but she immediately called for a second. Look, we're looking at polls. We're looking at polls. The worst -- the worst poll that we've had was 71 that I see, 71% to like 24 or 25. [Crosstalk]

Donald Trump: They won't look at it. But they want a second debate because they lost. Every poll shows they lost. And when you look at that, it was obviously three on one. [Inaudible] Thank you. What do you -- I love this guy.

Question: Lebanon, Lebanon, Lebanon [Inaudible] How would you rate your performance?

Donald Trump: I thought [Inaudible] I had a great debate. I thought this was [Inaudible]. [Crosstalk]

Question: [Inaudible] what Kamala Harris did.

Donald Trump: Well, I thought she was not very good tonight. She didn't protect the vice president. He's -- you know the office of the vice president. Certainly --

Question: Mr. President, we can't hear you over here.

Donald Trump: If you take a look at it, she was terrible with respect to the president. She's trying to get herself away from Biden, and she wasn't able to do that tonight. I think it was a big thing. They wanted to disassociate with Biden, and they weren't able to do it. [Crosstalk]

Question: [Inaudible] multiple times [Inaudible] Project 2025.

Donald Trump: I have nothing to do with it. [Crosstalk] I actually thought they were just [Inaudible]

Question: Will you apologize [Inaudible]? [Crosstalk] [Inaudible] their pets, the dogs, the migrants? President Trump, I'm Yusef Salaam. [Crosstalk] Sir, how you doing? [Crosstalk] Mr. President, Mr. President --

Donald Trump: I thought it was a great debate. I thought it was my best performance. I don't even view it as a performance. Our country is in decline. We're a nation in decline, and I thought that we got that out. She was unable to defend it. She was certainly bad on foreign policy. She was very bad on the border.

Donald Trump: And the polls are showing what I have. One poll is 92% to six, and all of the polls are 60, 70, and 80 in our direction. So, I thought it was a great debate from my standpoint. [Crosstalk]

Question: What about Black voters? What about Black voters, Mr. President? What do you think Black voters saw?

Donald Trump: I love -- I love Black voters. I love them, and they love me, too. [Crosstalk]

Question: The Black [Inaudible], Mr. President, what are the numbers for Black [Crosstalk]

Donald Trump: It's true. You take a look at it [Inaudible] well, you can check it out.

Question: Do you think you're going to lose? [Crosstalk] Mr. President, do you think you're going to lose the Haitian vote with these claims about eating cats?

Donald Trump: I really don't know. I mean, I really don't know. I just say -- all I do is say the truth. I say the truth. If I lose votes or gain votes, I don't care, but this was my best debate. I thought it was very good. I thought she was very weak on foreign policy. She was very weak on the border, and I'm very happy with [Crosstalk]

Question: [Inaudible] by the moderators. Kamala Harris was [Inaudible] once. [Crosstalk]

Unidentified: Take one step back. Everybody, one step back. Step back, everybody. Everybody got to step back. Don't want to step [Inaudible] be careful. Be careful. [Crosstalk]
