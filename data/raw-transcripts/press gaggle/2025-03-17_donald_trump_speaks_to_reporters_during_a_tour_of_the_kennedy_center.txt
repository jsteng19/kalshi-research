Question: [Inaudible] Mr. President?

Donald Trump: Well, it needs a lot of work, but we'll be -- we're going to make it great, just like we're going to make the country great and DC great. And this is a big part of DC. I hear the acoustics are fantastic in the center, so that's -- that's a big thing. They usually aren't in places, so that's good. I'll tell you what, why don't you stay [Inaudible] if you -- if you're ready, go ahead.

Question: What are the changes are you looking to make to the Kennedy Center?

Donald Trump: We'll make a lot of changes, including the seats, the decor, pretty much everything needs a lot of work.

Question: Somebody sent me -- Mr. President, are you surprised by the reaction that the vice president got here at the Kennedy Center the other day?

Donald Trump: I don't know about that. He's the most popular vice president we've had in years. He's doing a great job. I don't know anything about it. I figured you'd ask the question.

Question: Mr. President, what are we talking about price-wise to renovate to bring it up to, you know --

Donald Trump: We're looking at that whatever it is. I think -- you know, it's such an important part of the fabric of the country and of DC, so we -- look, we want to do it right. We'll do it right, and we'll do it once.
