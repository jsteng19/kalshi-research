Question: Mr. President, a group of New York senators has now supported elections to keep you off [Inaudible] ballot in New York. What is your response to that?

Donald Trump: So, today was a very good day. Today, we proved yet again, every day, we do, that this was a -- an amazing company. It has more cash than the loans. We have bigger -- much bigger cash than any of the loans. The loans were paid back in full. There was no problem with the loans. The bank was very happy. They testified.

Donald Trump: Everything was perfect. And it's a disgrace that this case goes forward, and it shouldn't go forward. The other thing we're asking is that -- and we're asking actually the media to look at. We won, as you know, in the Court of Appeals, and the judge refuses to honor that victory. This is the first that anybody can find.

Donald Trump: When you win in the Court of Appeals, the judge has no choice but to honor it. This judge, did he? This was like something happened a number of years ago where a developer had zoning and the zoning was done and completed, and this judge didn't like the zoning, so he vetoed it and he said he's not going to allow the building to be built.

Donald Trump: And then the Court of Appeals overturned him. But this is a case that should have never been brought. This is a witch hunt. This is election interference at a level that has never seen before, comes out of the DOJ and the White House in order to hurt a political opponent. And actually, it's driving up my polls because the people of our country get it. Our poll numbers are the highest they've ever had, and the people of our country get it. It's a disgrace to America.

Donald Trump: Thank you very much.
