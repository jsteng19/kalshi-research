Question: Mr. President --

Donald Trump: Thank you very much. We're gonna see the big golf tournament at Doral, I'm speaking tonight for charity. And, uh, then we'll be coming back here pretty quickly. But, uh, they're having a big, uh, event, a lot of charitable causes are involved, so we look forward to that. It's in Miami, at Doral.

Question: President Trump, the markets, the markets today are way down. The worst day in years because of the tariffs, so how's it going?

Donald Trump: I think it's going very well. It was an operation, like when a patient gets operated on, and, uh, it's a big thing. I said this would exactly be the way it is. Uh, we have six or seven trillion dollars coming into our country and, uh, we've never seen anything like it. Uh, the markets are gonna boom, the stock is gonna boom, the country's gonna boom, and the rest of the world wants to see, is there any way they can make a deal?

Donald Trump: Uh, they've taken a way -- advantage of us for many, many years. For many years, we've been at the wrong side of the ball. And I'll tell you what, that, I think it's gonna be unbelievable. The thing that people have to talk about, we're up almost to $7 trillion of investment coming into our country. And, uh, you'll see how it's gonna turn out. Our country's gonna boom.
