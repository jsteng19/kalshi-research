Question: [Inaudible, about Hurricane Michael]

Donald Trump: We have thousands of people lined up, so we wanted to make this stop. [Inaudible] It would be very unfair. You have thousands of people who started coming last night, so we're going to do that and, we got a lot of happy people. In the meantime, we have it very well covered in Florida, from the White House, from here, from what's on the plane, and we'll be back very shortly. But it would have been very very unfair to thousands of people who we'll see over there. How are you?

Question: Good to see you.

Donald Trump: Nice to see you. So I'll see you over at the place. You all going over there?
