Donald Trump: Thank you very much. This is a trial that should have never been brought. I'd say trial that is being looked upon and looked at all over the world. They're calling -- they're looking at it and analyzing it. Every legal pundit, every legal scholar said this trial is a disgrace. We have a Trump-hating judge.

Donald Trump: We have a judge who shouldn't be on this case. He's totally conflicted. But this is a trial that should never happen. It should have been thrown out a long time ago. If you look at Jonathan Turley, Andy McCarthy, all great legal scholars, there's not one that we've been able to find that said this should be a trial.

Donald Trump: I called a -- I was -- I was paying a lawyer and marked it down as a legal expense. Some accountant, and I didn't know, marked it down as a legal expense. That's exactly what it was. And you get indicted over that? I should be right now in Pennsylvania, in Florida, in many other states, North Carolina, Georgia campaigning.

Donald Trump: This is all coming from the Biden White House because the guy can't put two sentences together. He can't campaign. He's using this in order to try and win an election. And it's not working that way. It's working the opposite way. So check it out, legal expense. It's called legal expense. That's what you're supposed to call it.

Question: Mr. Trump, why --

Donald Trump: Nobody's ever seen -- nobody has ever seen anything like it. So, thank you very much for coming.

Question: [Inaudible]

Donald Trump: I'm now going to sit down for many hours -- I am now going to sit down -- the voters understand that all you have to do is look at the polls. This is a sham trial, and the judge should recuse himself --

Question: [Inaudible]

Donald Trump: Because he's totally conflicted. Thank you very much.
