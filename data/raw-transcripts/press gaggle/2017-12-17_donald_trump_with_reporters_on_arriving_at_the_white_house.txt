Question: [Inaudible, question about emails being taken improperly by the special counsel]

Donald Trump: Not looking good. It's not looking good. It's quite sad to see that, so my people are very upset about it. I can't imagine there's anything on him frankly because, as we said, there's no collusion. There's no collusion whatsoever. But a lot of lawyers thought that was pretty sad. Go ahead.

Question: [Inaudible]

Donald Trump: A little louder. Helicopter. A lot of noise.

Question: [Inaudible, question about relations with Cuba]

Donald Trump: Yeah. Yeah, that's right. It is the anniversary, and hopefully everything will normalize with Cuba. But right now, they're not doing the right thing, and when they don't do the right thing, we're not going to do the right thing. That's all there is to it.

Donald Trump: We have to be strong with Cuba. The Cuban people are incredible people. They support me very strongly, but we'll get Cuba straightened out.

Question: [Inaudible, question about planning to fire Robert Mueller]

Donald Trump: No, I'm not. No. What else? What are you, surprised? What?

Question: [Inaudible, question about John McCain]

Donald Trump: I did speak to Cindy McCain, and I wished her well. I wished John well. They've headed back, but I understand he'll come if we ever needed his vote, which hopefully we won't.

Donald Trump: But the word is John will come back if we need his vote, and it's too bad. It's tough. He's going through a very he's going through a very tough time. There's no question about it, but he will come back if we need his vote. Thank you very much. Everybody. Thank you.
