Donald Trump: It's a lot of people. [Laughs]

Question: Hello, Mr. President.

Donald Trump: So we visited the military course just to see if we could fix it up and make it nice. Uh, the budgetary situation, takes them years to get something approved, so we're gonna take a look at that. It's two courses, very nice, but they need a lot of work. A lot of work, and if we can fix them up, they're military.

Donald Trump: They're for the military, if we could fix them up, we're gonna do that.

Question: Mr. President, did you speak with Bukele directly to facilitate the return of Abrego Garcia?

Donald Trump: I don't wanna say that, but, uh, he's returned.

Question: Did you have any conversations with --

Donald Trump: And he shouldn't have been returned. He should have never, he should have never had to be returned. I mean, you take a look at what's happened with him, you take a look at what they found in the grand jury and everywhere else. I thought Pam Bondi did a great job today.

Question: Was this your call to bring him back to the United States?

Donald Trump: I don't wanna say that.

Question: Mis- -- Mr. President, um, you posted yester- --

Donald Trump: And by the way, either way, it's a disaster. He's a whole disaster. Look at him with his, uh, with his antics. Not good. And for the Democrats who have backed him, uh, this was not the man from Maryland, this wonderful father from Maryland. This is a pretty, uh, a pretty bad guy.

Question: Mr. President, um, you posted yesterday that, um, and a good way to save money be to cancel some of Musk's contracts. How seriously are you considering that?

Donald Trump: Oh, I'll take a look at everything. I look at everything. He's got a lot of money. Uh, he gets a lot of subsidy, so we'll take a look at that. Only if it's fair. Only if it's fair for him and for the country, I would certainly think about it. Yeah. But it has to be fair.

Question: Mr. President, why do --

Question: And Mr. President, would you consider opening -- reopening investigations into his companies? There are a bunch of investigations.

Donald Trump: I didn't know that they had any, but, you know, they had them -- I would, uh, just let them speak for themselves. I had no idea. Excuse me. I have no idea whether or not they had investigations.

Question: But, but --

Question: And Mister -- what's your view on Elon Musk as of today? I mean, are, have you heard from him at all? Has your team --

Donald Trump: Honestly, I've been so busy working on China, working on Russia, working on Iran, working on so many d- -- I'm, I'm not thinking about Elon.

Question: On his -- On, on the China --

Donald Trump: You know, I just wish him well. It's, uh, you know --

Question: Yeah, on the, on the China talks, Sir, you had --

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Question: -- we had, there's a meeting coming up with --

Donald Trump: Right.

Question: -- Secretary Bessent --

Donald Trump: Here on Monday.

Question: -- and Secretary Lutnick, what do you hope to s --

Donald Trump: Monday in London.

Question: -- what do you hope to see from those talks in London, Sir, with China?

Donald Trump: No, we're very far advanced on the China deal. We wanted clarification. We had to have clarification -- Little bumpy up here. We had to have, we had to have clarification. And that's what we're really having the meeting about. We had a very good talk. I talked to President Xi for, I guess, more than two hours.

Donald Trump: Uh, we had a very good talk. It's a complicated deal, but it's a deal that's, uh, you know, gonna bring, bring us a lot of money and a lot of, uh, everything else. And we get along very well with President Xi and with China.

Note: [Crosstalk]

Question: -- on Mr. Musk's contracts do you feel like the U.S can survive without them? Obviously, [Inaudible] to you a lot when it comes to the Feds and space, and that relationship has been important for quite some time.

Donald Trump: The U.S could survive without almost anybody.

Question: Good luck.

Question: And do you --

Donald Trump: Except me. [Laughs] I'm just --

Question: Did you have any concerns about his drug use when he was working for you?

Donald Trump: Uh, I don't want to comment on his drug use. I, I don't know. I don't know what his status is. I read an article in the New York Times. I thought it was, frankly, it sounded very unfair to me.

Question: You said earlier today -- that Mr. Musk had a problem. What did you mean by that? And did, did you misjudge him by bringing hi --

Donald Trump: I don't wanna talk about problems. I think that, uh, my, uh, I think the United States had problems that, if you look at the numbers today, the numbers were unbelievable. The numbers were incredible. The numbers that came up today, the stock market went way up. Uh, the country's doing really well. Almost, I think in a very short period of time, you're gonna be saying doing better than it's ever done before.

Donald Trump: We have hundreds of plants coming in. Plants, uh -- A lot of jobs are being created. That's what, that's what happened this morning. You saw the jobs. And the nice part, they're not government jobs. They're jobs of people coming in and doing other things, including the leisure, hotel and leisure, so good stuff.

Donald Trump: A lot of good things are happening with our country. Uh, we're taking in billions of dollars of tariff money. The money is pouring in. And, uh, it hasn't even started yet really, rele- -- It's, uh, we're gonna have a very successful country very soon. And the stock market is seeing that. Uh, we have, and I've been saying it, we have the hottest country anywhere in the world, the hottest country.

Donald Trump: And if you think about it, six months ago we had the coldest country. We had a country that was a disaster. And we've done it very quickly. Okay, go ahead.

Question: Mr. President on the One Big Beautiful Bill, um, so your, your critics, um, uh, it, uh, o -- o -- often your critics, um --

Donald Trump: I don't have too many critics because, you know, honestly --

Question: Oh --

Donald Trump: -- I, I, I don't know of anybody that's gonna vote against it. Maybe Rand Paul or somebody. But, uh, you know, they always vote against --

Question: The --

Donald Trump: But I, I actually think that over the last 24 hours, it's even solidified. We have tremendous support.

Question: So wait, just to --

Donald Trump: [Inaudible]

Question: -- that up, step one to talk about the bill. They fail to, often fail to mention that your tariffs are actually offsetting a lot, y -- you know, the debt in itself.

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Question: I believe, uh, the CBO said, "2.8 trillion over the next 10 years."

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Question: Um, so what, what, what do you have to say to that?

Donald Trump: Well, we've got tremendous, uh, reviews and CBO, who never gives good -- Uh, basically it's a Democrat group. And, uh, we're getting tremendous reviews on the bill. Uh, we cut 1.6 trillion, trillion, not billion, trillion out of the budget. And yet, uh, we haven't affected anybody. We're gonna save and, and totally, uh, cherish Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid.

Donald Trump: Uh, the Democrats are gonna destroy it. They'll destroy it. We're gonna save it and make it stronger than it ever before. So, Medicare, Medicaid, they just make statements, "Oh, he is gonna talk." We're not, we're not touching it other than waste, fraud, and abuse.

Question: That was my next question, Mister-

Question: Mr. President, um, on Russia, Ukraine. Um, did, did the Ukraine drone strikes against the n- -- the bombers inside Russia, the airfields, did that change your view at all of what Zelenskyy, the cards he has -- [Inaudible]

Donald Trump: Well, they gave, they gave, uh, Putin a reason to go in and bomb the hell out of 'em last night. That's the thing I didn't like about it. When I saw it, I said, "Here we go. Now it's gonna be a strike." You know, I did something that people don't talk about and I don't talk about very much, but we solved a big problem, a nuclear problem, potentially, with India and with Pakistan.

Donald Trump: And I spoke to Pakistan, and I spoke to India. They have really great leaders. And, but they were going at it, and they could've gone at it, nuclear, both nuclear countries, strong nuclear countries. And I talked about trade, and I said, "We're not doing trade if you guys are gonna be throwing bombs at each other." And they both stopped.

Donald Trump: And I stopped that war immediately. That was going, as you know, that was going much further. And hopefully not to nuclear, but it might've gone to nuclear. In fact, it might've gone to nuclear in the next round, but we stopped it. And I event- I'd like to comment the leaders of both country, Pakistan and India,

Question: Are you worried that there might be a nuclear breakout with Russia, Ukraine? Are you worried that that could get --

Donald Trump: I don't. I hope not. I hope not. I think it's a war that would've never happened. If I were president, that wouldn't have happened. I certainly hope not.

Question: Mr. President, Senator Hawley said, um, he had spoken with you about --

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Question: -- potentially removing, um, uh, cuts that were in the House passed bill to, to Medicaid that would hurt, uh, Trump voters in rural areas. Uh, what are your thoughts about that?

Donald Trump: Well, I did speak about that. We're really talking about waste, fraud, and abuse. And, uh, Senator Hawley's a great senator. He's good guy. And I did speak to him, and we wanna make sure that doesn't hurt anybody, you know, because it is, uh, it is about waste, fraud, and abuse. That's the only thing. And everybody wants to --

Question: Mr. Trump, on Russia, Ukraine, uh, where are you at with the Senate sanctioned bills? There's been some reporting that the White House is, you know -- [Inaudible]

Donald Trump: Well, I know the bill.

Question: -- water down.

Donald Trump: I started the bill. We're gonna see. I mean, if we're -- if I think there's -- Uh, if I think Russia will not be making a deal or stopping the bloodshed, uh, five and six, even I've been saying five and six, and now it's more, uh, thousand a week, soldiers being killed, and people being killed, not just soldiers, people being killed, but largely soldiers being killed.

Donald Trump: Uh, yeah, I'd use it if it's necessary.

Question: But are you trying to --

Donald Trump: And they really give me that option.

Question: Are you trying to get the Senate to water it down, though --

Donald Trump: No. No, I haven't.

Question: -- from its current version?

Donald Trump: I haven't spoken to them about it. Uh, they have a bill, that's gonna be up to me. Uh, it's my option. They've made it that way. And it would save a lotta time if that --

Question: Do you-

Donald Trump: -- happens. So I'm okay with it.

Question: -- do you think we've had a -- [Inaudible]

Donald Trump: I haven't decided to use it.

Question: Mr. President --

Question: But --

Donald Trump: It's a very, it's a very strong bill.

Question: Mr. President, you gave Elon Musk when he left White House, a key, uh, symbolically to the White House, to the administration at large. I think that's what --

Donald Trump: Yeah?

Question: -- what was it. Would you like him to give that back at this point?

Donald Trump: No, I don't take things back, no. I --

Question: What about the Tesla?

Donald Trump: I gave him a key. He tried very hard. The Tesla --

Question: Yeah, how, what's --

Donald Trump: -- I ha- I haven't thought about it.

Question: -- your [Inaudible] on his work, then, as if this point for the, for the administration? How do you think his DOGE did at the end of the day with the savings that he --

Donald Trump: Oh, I think it helped us a lot. I think it helped our thinking, and it's not finished at all. We, we are taking, we've basically taken it over, and we're doing a job. Many of those people remain with us, and they're going to remain with us. They're very good. Uh, it's, uh, it's terrific. We saved, you know, hundreds of billions of dollars.

Donald Trump: It's terrific. And it's going further. I mean, I, I'd give you the answer actually at the end of two years, because a lot of it is out into the future.

Question: Sure.

Donald Trump: But it was a big saving and a good mindset.

Question: Do --

Question: And what are you gonna do about the Tesla? Are you gonna keep it or are you gonna --

Donald Trump: I haven't thought about, you know.

Question: Do you have any plans to contact --

Donald Trump: I mean, I hope he does well with Tesla.

Question: Mr. President --

Question: Do you have any plans to speak with Mr. Musk? This was one of your closest advisors for months.

Donald Trump: Yeah, no. I don't have any plans. Uh, somebody made a mistake. I -- A lot of reporters have been calling me. I, I didn't call any reporter. A lot of reporters, they asked me the same question.

Question: And there were apparently-

Donald Trump: No, I don't. I'm not even thinking about that.

Question: There apparently were these efforts, uh, this is what I read, to bring you guys, you and Elon back together. So those, those efforts are -- Where are they? They're --

Donald Trump: No, no, there are outbreaks. I mean, I've been asked about it, but, uh, I'm not really interested in that. I'm really interested in the country, in solving problems, including war problems in, uh, very far away lands. A lot of people being killed. You know, when I left, we had no problem. We didn't have wars.

Donald Trump: We defeated ISIS a 100%. Iran was broke. There was no Hamas problem. There was no Hezbollah problem. Israel wouldn't have happened in other words. Uh, Russia-Ukraine wouldn't have happened. We had no inflation. And by the way, we have no inflation now. And if we had a good Fed Chairman, you would lower rates.

Donald Trump: And you know what? If inflation happened in a year from now or two years, let him raise rates. But we're going out for long-term debt or short-term debt. We have a lot of debt coming due because Biden had all short-term debt mostly. And, uh, we would get a lower rate and a lower interest rate if this guy would lower rates, we get a lower interest rate.

Donald Trump: It's unbelievable. And he's worried about inflation. If he worries about inflation any longer, all he has to do is get the lower rate. Let us go out, borrow at a much lower rate, much lower. You could go down a point or two, we'll go out, borrow but -- And if in two years inflation comes back, he raises rates, but he keeps him the same.

Question: Yeah, are --

Donald Trump: It's just, it's insane.

Question: Are you already thinking about your next Fed chair?

Donald Trump: What did you say? Say it.

Question: Are you already thinking about who your next Fed chair would be? I know it's 2026 when his term expires.

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Question: Who? So you're already thinking about it?

Donald Trump: Oh, yes. Sure. It's coming out very soon.

Question: Who are you thinking about that?

Donald Trump: Uh, I could tell you, but, uh, I don't think I will.

Question: What do you make --

Donald Trump: I have a pretty good idea who it is.

Question: What's the latest on trade?

Donald Trump: He's very highly thought of.

Question: What do you make of the Ayatollah saying that they, they have to enrich, they have to be able to enrich.

Donald Trump: No, they won't be enriching. If, uh, they enrich, then we're going to have to do it the other way. And I don't really want to do it the other way, but we're gonna have no choice.

Question: What's the latest with --

Donald Trump: There's not going to be enrichment.

Question: Um, just one more on Abrego Garcia, sir, because this is a big news for today.

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Question: Uh, just months ago, it seemed like from El Salvador to even your administration, that there was no chances that he would be returned. So can you just explain to the American people what sort of happened to facilitate his return in the last few --

Donald Trump: Well, DOJ made a decision. I think their decisions have been very, very good. Uh, and maybe they just said, "Look, all of these people, these judges, they want to, uh, try and run the country. The judges are trying to -- " A local judge trying to run the country. Uh, the, uh, man has a horrible past and I could see a decision being made, bring him back, show everybody how horrible this guy is. And frankly, we have to do something because the judges are trying to take the place of a president that, uh, won in a landslide.

Donald Trump: And that's not supposed to be the way it is. And, uh, so I could see bringing him back. I could see it either way, bringing him back or not bringing him back. But by bringing him back, you show how bad he is. He's a bad guy.

Question: Mr. President, we're backing in. On China, sir, did President Xi agree to restart the flow of rare earth minerals --

Donald Trump: We're landing right now, I'm sorry.

Question: And magnets?

Donald Trump: Say it, what?

Question: Did President Xi agree to restart the flow of rare of minerals and magnets?

Donald Trump: Yes he did. Thank you very much everybody.

Question: Thank you, Mr. President.

Question: Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you for coming back.
