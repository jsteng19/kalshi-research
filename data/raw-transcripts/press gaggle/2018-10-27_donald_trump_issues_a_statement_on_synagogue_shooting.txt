Donald Trump: So we're with the Future Farmers of America, a tremendous group of people. A tremendous gathering. It's the future. And we look very much forward to that.

Donald Trump: And what happened today is a horrible, horrible thing. We're learning a lot about it. It looks definitely like it's an anti-Semitic crime. And that is something you wouldn't believe could still be going on. But it would seem to be an anti-Semitic crime.

Donald Trump: We'll have a lot of information over the next hour. The FBI is involved. Everybody is involved. And I spoke with the Governor, Governor Wolf. I spoke with the Mayor of Pittsburgh, who is a terrific guy, and he is devastated. So we'll have a lot of information over the next hour.

Donald Trump: But a lot of people killed. A lot of people very badly wounded. And they say as a crime scene, it's one of the worst that some professionals, that have seen many, many crimes scenes, they say it's one of the worst that they've seen. So, we'll be back with you in a little while.

Donald Trump: I'm going to, in my remarks, open with a statement about what took place. Thank you all very much.
