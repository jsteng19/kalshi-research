Donald Trump: I don't know if you can hear me because they don't allow mics. But this is a political witch hunt, the likes of which nobody's ever seen before. They owe me damages for what they've done. We have a great company. We're a very innocent company. We did everything right. They have no witness against us other than Michael Cohen, who's a discredited felon.

Donald Trump: They have no witnesses against us whatsoever. They don't have one piece of paper. What we've run is a great company, and that's been proven. Very highly successful company. This was a political witch hunt for election interference, but also for getting somebody elected because he wanted to get the publicity.

Donald Trump: It's a disgrace. And they should pay me damages. That's the way it should be. They should be paying me damages. This is a disgraceful situation. This is why businesses are fleeing New York like Exxon. Millions and millions of dollars a year in taxes, and I pay millions and millions of dollars a year. We paid approximately $300 million over a fairly short period of time.

Donald Trump: And they don't want me to pay it anymore. This is a very serious problem because companies are fleeing New York. They ought to focus on the crime, violent crime in the city, one of the reasons they're fleeing. The other reason they flee is because of attorney generals like this that just want to get elected.

Donald Trump: Thank you very much. It's been a very successful trial. I don't know that we're going to get a fair -- a fair ruling. But everybody knows -- everybody knows what I just said. This is a sham, and it's a shame. Thank you.
