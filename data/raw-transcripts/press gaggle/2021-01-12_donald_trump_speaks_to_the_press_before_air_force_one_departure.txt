Donald Trump: I think that big tech is doing a horrible thing for our country and to our country. And I believe it's going to be a catastrophic mistake for them. They're dividing and divisive, and they're showing something that I've been predicting for a long time. I've been predicting it for a long time, and people didn't act on it.

Donald Trump: But I think big tech has made a terrible mistake, and very, very bad for our country. And that's leading others to do the same thing, and it causes a lot of problems and a lot of danger. Big mistake. They shouldn't be doing it. But there's always a counter move when they do that. I've never seen such anger as I see right now, and that's a terrible thing. Terrible thing.

Donald Trump: And you have to always avoid violence. And we have -- we have tremendous support.

Question: What is your role, sir?

Donald Trump: We have support probably like nobody has ever seen before. Always have to avoid violence.

Question: Mr. President, what is your role in what happened at the Capitol? What is your personal responsibility?

Donald Trump: So if you read my speech -- and many people have done it, and I've seen it both in the papers and in the media, on television -- it's been analyzed, and people thought that what I said was totally appropriate.

Donald Trump: And if you look at what other people have said -- politicians at a high level -- about the riots during the summer, the horrible riots in Portland and Seattle, in various other -- other places, that was a real problem -- what they said.

Donald Trump: But they've analyzed my speech and words and my final paragraph, my final sentence, and everybody, to the T, thought it was totally appropriate.

Donald Trump: Okay, thank you. Thank you.
