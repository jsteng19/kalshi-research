Donald Trump: Thank you very much. Everybody saw what happened today. I don't think we have to do any extra explaining. I'm not allowed to, anyway, because this judge is corrupt. He's a corrupt judge. This judge, what he did and what his ruling was is a disgrace. Everybody saw what happened today. He's a corrupt judge, and he's totally conflicted.

Donald Trump: And I got to get back on the campaign trail. I'm not supposed to be here. We are so innocent. There's never been anything like it. We have every single analyst, legal analyst, I'm innocent and I'm being held in this court with a corrupt judge who's totally conflicted. Take a look at his conflict. It's a disgrace to the city of New York, to the state of New York, and to the country.

Donald Trump: Thank you very much.
