Donald Trump: So we're going to the game. It'll be a great game. It'll be something that a lot of people want to see. And we'll be in New Orleans, and we look forward to it. The stock market way up. The country is doing really well. And we'll see you at the game.

Question: Mr. President, what did the intelligence show about the threat to the four embassies? What did the intelligence show?

Donald Trump: Well, first of all, I think it's been totally consistent. But here's what's been consistent: We killed Soleimani, the number-one terrorist in the world by every account. Bad person. Killed a lot of Americans, killed a lot of people. We killed him. And when the Democrats try and defend him, it's a disgrace to our country.
