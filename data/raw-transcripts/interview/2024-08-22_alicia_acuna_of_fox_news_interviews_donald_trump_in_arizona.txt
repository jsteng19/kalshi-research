Alicia Acuna: As you know, a manhunt is currently underway in Cochise County, where we are standing. And it's for a man who the sheriff's department says was threatening to kill you. Does that make you want to change the way you do events or anything? How do you respond to that?

Donald Trump: It makes me want to get away from this interview because you and I are standing out here. And I was told, "Do you think you could do it someplace else?" But I said I can't keep you waiting. You are Fox after all. But, no, I've heard about that. But I have to do my job. It's a job. It's a dangerous job, but I have to do my job.

Donald Trump: This is so sad, and you've seen the whole thing today. And I hope you're going to report on it fairly. But this border is so dangerous. It's so bad and so horrible to people. They're losing children and wives and husbands, and it's just a horrible thing. And we can stop it. And Kamala is a disaster. She's a radical-left Marxist, and she wants an open border.

Donald Trump: She wants all the people -- the man you're talking about, she wants him to just flow right through. No, we can't do that.
