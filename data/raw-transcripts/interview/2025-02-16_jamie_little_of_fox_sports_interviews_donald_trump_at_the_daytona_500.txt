Jamie Little: I'm joined now by the president of the United States. Mr. President, five years ago, we were standing in this very spot.

Donald Trump: That's right.

Jamie Little: What brings you back to the "Great American Race"?

Donald Trump: Well, I think it's fantastic. It's great for the country. Our country is doing well again. And we have spirit -- all over the world, there's spirit again. We brought it back, and it's been less than four weeks. So, you'll see what we do in -- in a little period of time, it's going to only get better. But this is very exciting.

Jamie Little: You brought your granddaughter.

Donald Trump: That's right. Carolina.

Jamie Little: I know some of your other family members are here. You get to take a ride around in the Beast.

Donald Trump: I'm going to do that.

Jamie Little: What is that like?

Donald Trump: Well, I'll let you know in about two minutes, because it's going to be -- they're going to be going quite quickly, I understand.

Jamie Little: And you just got to meet some of the drivers.

Donald Trump: I did.

Jamie Little: Are you going to get on the radio again and talk to them before the start of this?

Donald Trump: I'm going to talk to them. And I say they have a lot of courage doing this. I see it, and I've been here, and they have a lot of guts, as they would say.

Jamie Little: Mr. President, enjoy your time.

Donald Trump: Thank you very much. Great.
