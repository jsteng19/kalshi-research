Rob Schmitt: President-elect Trump joins us now on the phone. And, sir, it's good to have you back on tonight.

Donald Trump: Well, thank you very much, Rob.

Rob Schmitt: And I want to start, if I can. I just want to play just a quick few seconds from Joe Biden just a few hours ago. Let's take a listen.

Note: [Begin video clip]

Joe Biden: [Video clip] I put together one of the most competent foreign policy teams, I would argue, in American history sitting in this room and before my eyes.

Note: [End video clip]

Rob Schmitt: The State Department speech there. Your thoughts, sir?

Donald Trump: Well, look, I don't want to insult people, and they're on their way out finally. You thought this day would never arrive. And it's -- what we've -- what we've suffered at the border, you know, people talked about their foreign policy. They talked about the inflation. They talked about all the things that happened.

Donald Trump: We wouldn't have had inflation. We wouldn't have had any wars. We wouldn't have had Russia, Ukraine. We shouldn't have ever had the Israel -- Israel would not have been attacked by Iran, which because, ultimately, it was Iran that did it. But when you look at what happened during this last four-year period, I think it was the lowest point in the history of our country.

Donald Trump: It's been so bad. And I watched what he said. And he's trying to make good of everything like he talks about Afghanistan. Well, I was -- we were moving out, too, but it would have been with dignity and grace and strength and all of those things. And, you know, what -- what he -- what he did with the airplane and the people falling off the plane and the craziness and 13 dead soldiers and leaving billions and billions of dollars worth of equipment in the hands of the Taliban, it's just -- you know, it just couldn't have been -- couldn't have been any worse than that.

Donald Trump: And I think, probably, that's why Putin invaded. When he saw the incompetence of Milley and these people, he said, "Wow, these people are not so good. We're going to go and do the invasion of Ukraine." I really think that was a big -- a big factor. No, it's been a -- it's been a terrible four years. And I think, frankly, the worst thing of all is allowing 21 million people or more, you know, the gotaways.

Donald Trump: I don't even include them, but 21 million people, of which many of them are criminals, many of them are murderers. Many of them are murderers of more than one person. And I think that's the single biggest thing. It's -- it's going to destroy our country.

Rob Schmitt: And --

Donald Trump: You look at -- if we don't get this taken care of -- and we have great people, Tom Homan, who you know well. But if we don't get this taken care of, our country will be destroyed by that.

Rob Schmitt: Yeah. You're preparing a number of executive orders that are going to -- next Monday, next Monday afternoon. Immigration is -- is the big one, and that's where I wanted to go to next. How fast do you think Americans are going to see results? We're going to start seeing deportations. How fast will we feel what you're about to do?

Donald Trump: Immediately. It's going to be immediate. We have the safest border in history when -- during my presidency. When I turned around and looked at that beautiful chart that came down from a crane or wherever it came from, that was a chart on immigration with the best immigration numbers we ever had. And we're going to have them again.

Donald Trump: We're going to have them maybe even better. But we have -- we have to get a lot of people out. We have criminals at a level that nobody can believe, terrorists. And as I said, murderers, people that murdered people, many people, murdered more than one. They came from prisons, and they came from -- they came from mental institutions, insane asylums.

Donald Trump: They are street gangs from Venezuela and many other countries. Not only -- not only South America, they are from all over the world.

Rob Schmitt: Yeah.

Donald Trump: The Congo is well-represented. What they did to us, I just cannot understand how this could be good. They had an open-border policy. As soon as I heard open border, I said, "Wow, you know, we're going to get all the prisoners from -- from these countries." And I know many of the leaders of these countries.

Donald Trump: They're smart, they're savvy, you know, street-wise, very street-wise.

Rob Schmitt: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And they're giving -- I said, "They're going to empty their jails out into our country." That's exactly what happened.

Rob Schmitt: Well, Biden, I mean, I'm not -- I'm not going to play the sound bite. It's a ridiculous one. But Biden today actually claimed that illegal entry went way down when he became the president of the United States, which just, I think, shows you their inherent capacity to lie. Imagine saying that?

Donald Trump: Well, they lied about Russia, Russia, Russia. They lied about the son. He lied about his son won't get a pardon and many other aspects of his son, many, many other aspects. And they lie about everything. They lie about everything. Not only him, everybody, that party. They -- they're going to try and blame the fires in Los Angeles --

Rob Schmitt: Yeah.

Donald Trump: They'll probably try and blame us for that. You know, I was -- when I was president, I demanded that this guy, the governor, accept the water coming from the north --

Rob Schmitt: Yeah.

Donald Trump: From way up in Canada. And, you know, the north, it flows down through --

Rob Schmitt: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Right through Los Angeles. I mean, massive, millions and millions of gallons of water a week, probably, I think, even a day. Massive amounts coming out from the mountains, from the melts --

Rob Schmitt: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And even without it, even during the summer, it's a natural flow of water. They would have had so much water.

Rob Schmitt: It's --

Donald Trump: They wouldn't have known what to do with it. You would have never had the fires. People would have been able to sprinkle their lawns and everything else. You know, the problem is it's so dry. It was always so dry there. And it's just a -- it's just a mess. They could have -- they could have, you know, maintained their forests and, as I said, they have to do. I said, "You're going to have a real problem here someday."

Rob Schmitt: I remember when --

Donald Trump: Unfortunately, I was right.

Rob Schmitt: When you -- when you went to Paradise in 2018, and you scolded Newsom about clearance --

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Rob Schmitt: And brush clearance.

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Rob Schmitt: But there's, obviously, so much -- there's so much incompetence at every level with these fires in Los Angeles. Obviously, they have 100 mile an hour winds, and it's extremely dry. It hadn't rained in eight months, and I can understand that. But there's a lot of incompetence, too. But as far as -- I mean, it's amazing to me that -- that this state, they send more than 200 billion every year to that state government, and they still can't figure out water.

Rob Schmitt: You still can't water your lawn in the fall when you live in Los Angeles. I lived out there for a few years. They're telling people to take short showers. They can't -- they have an ocean right there, and they can't figure out the most basic things that people need with $200 billion a year.

Donald Trump: Yeah, it's not -- it's not believable. They spend money like you've never seen, like -- I've never seen anything like it. We're going to -- we're going to do things with Los Angeles. You know, I'm already putting my developer cap on because it looks -- literally, I just saw some very guarded pictures of it, and it's far worse than you even see on television, if that's believable.

Rob Schmitt: Yeah.

Donald Trump: It literally -- I believe it's greater damage than if they got hit by a nuclear weapon. I've never seen anything like it.

Rob Schmitt: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Vast miles and miles of houses just burned to a crisp. There's nothing standing.

Rob Schmitt: It's a size of Paris.

Donald Trump: And they're going to find many bodies.

Rob Schmitt: Yeah.

Donald Trump: You know, only the dogs will find them, right? You know, German Shepherds will. They can -- they can pick out the ashes immediately. It's amazing. But we're going to find many bodies.

Rob Schmitt: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And many more, many more dead.

Rob Schmitt: Newsom -- Newsom -- Newsom says you're lying, you're putting out disinformation about this. He's also invited you to go see him there. You think he should resign? I think a lot of people in that state believe he should resign. Are you going to go -- are you going to go tour this damage with Gavin Newsom like you did in 2018?

Donald Trump: Well, this is different than 2018. 2018 was more of a -- you know, it was -- it was caused by the exact same factor. It was all the underbrush. You know, when I was visited by the presidents of places like Finland and Austria and others, they would -- I talk about it because we used to have to give so much money mostly to California for the fires.

Donald Trump: And they said, "We have a much more flammable tree, very good wood, but very flammable," in Austria. And they said, "We don't have forest fires." And they raked their floor. You know, they rake the leaves off every -- I think, twice every year. And they rake the leaves. And they have it nice and spick and span.

Donald Trump: If you look at the trees -- even now, I'm watching. I become like an all-time expert at this, but -- and when you say Paradise, I looked at Paradise, you know, the place was burned to a crisp. Steel from houses. I mean, they'd have steel beams going across, you know, on some of these houses. And -- and it was melted, it was just melted.

Donald Trump: And yet, the trees were all standing. It was amazing. And the trees stand because they're loaded up with water. You know, they suck the water out of the ground. And they're wet, they're very wet. And those trees, many of those trees just remain standing. What happens is when the tree falls down, it's got 18 months before it becomes a matchstick.

Donald Trump: And you have to remove those trees because they're -- literally, it's like lighting a match. And it's -- they don't do that. And I said, You have to maintain your forest." I learned from Austria, from some of the -- the countries, they said, "We are a forest nation."

Rob Schmitt: Right.

Donald Trump: They live in a forest, they don't have oceans. They don't have -- they live in a forest. Beautiful forest, by the way. You know, it's beautiful, it's actually immaculate. But they live in a forest. He said -- I remember the one said that -- I think it was Finland. He said, "We're a forest nation." And we don't have, you know, anything like what they have there.

Donald Trump: And we have a much more flammable tree. And I told this to him. I said, "You got to clean this thing because they've never done any of it." When trees fall down, they've been down for 30 years. They're like -- literally, you can -- you could -- you could take a match --

Rob Schmitt: It's firewood.

Donald Trump: And it would catch on fire in two seconds.

Rob Schmitt: Yeah.

Donald Trump: It's terrible. It's firewood.

Rob Schmitt: Yeah.

Donald Trump: It's great firewood, I guess.

Rob Schmitt: Yeah.

Donald Trump: I assume it is good firewood, and therefore, it has a value. And you know, they --

Rob Schmitt: So --

Donald Trump: But they never -- they never did anything to prevent this from happening.

Rob Schmitt: Do you --

Donald Trump: And it always bothered me sending them so much money.

Rob Schmitt: Do you think that'll -- will that change -- will that change now? I mean, are -- are they going to learn a lesson? I mean, we -- we just saw, Trudeau's out. Do you think Gavin Newsom is next? I mean, is this going to cost him anything politically? Or will California continue to go on at this very, you know, mind-boggling, stupid pace that they're at?

Donald Trump: Well, in terms of the forest, there's not that much to change. There's nothing left. You know, it's -- I've never seen anything like it.

Rob Schmitt: That's amazing.

Donald Trump: The place is just desolate. It literally looks like a bomb --

Rob Schmitt: Yeah.

Donald Trump: A massive bomb was dropped on top of them. It is -- the only thing standing are a couple of chimneys. Most of the chimneys were wiped out, too, by the way. But, you know, every once in a while, you see like a chimney standing.

Rob Schmitt: Yeah.

Donald Trump: The place is literally it was bombed.

Rob Schmitt: Let me --

Donald Trump: I can't even imagine.

Rob Schmitt: Yeah, it's terrifying. I want to move on because I got a lot of stuff I want to talk about. I want to talk about Israel here for a second. It's been reported that a hostage deal is very close to being done. Even Reuters today is admitting that this is because you're coming into power, and obviously, Hamas is terrified of that.

Rob Schmitt: You've had Steve Witkoff working on this.

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Rob Schmitt: Is there anything that you can share with us that we don't know about this potential deal?

Donald Trump: Only that we are very close to getting it done, and they have to get it done. If they don't get it done, there's going to be a lot of trouble out there, a lot of trouble like they have never seen before. And they will get it done. And I understand it's -- it's been -- there's been a handshake, and they're getting it finished and maybe by the end of the week.

Donald Trump: But it has to take place. It has to --

Rob Schmitt: It's unbelievable that for 500, 600 days, these hostages have been waiting. And it was all because we just couldn't flex hard enough on this group. It's -- it's -- that's so sad, you know.

Donald Trump: Well, it's a horrible thing.

Rob Schmitt: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And a lot of people have died, and the numbers are -- you know, part of the deal is we're going to bring bodies out. You're going to bring bodies out.

Rob Schmitt: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Bodies from what? Why would they have died? But they lived in tunnels that were three-feet high in some cases. In some cases, less than that with closed ends. Can you imagine that?

Rob Schmitt: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And they've been like this so long. This would have never happened if I was president, I'll tell you. It never would have happened.

Rob Schmitt: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And Iran didn't have the money to give them. Iran was broke --

Rob Schmitt: Broke, yeah.

Donald Trump: Essentially. And now, you know, they have a lot of money, although they have been -- they have been hurt over the last few months certainly.

Rob Schmitt: Yeah, we've been funding this war in Ukraine for three years now. You've said you want this war ended in six months. What is the strategy to do that? Can you give us any insight?

Donald Trump: Well, there's only one strategy, and it's up to Putin. And I can't imagine he's too thrilled with the way it's gone because it hasn't gone exactly well for him either. And I know he wants to meet, and I'm going to meet very quickly. I'd like to -- I would have done it sooner. But, frankly, you know, you sort of need a little bit of -- like, you have to get into the office.

Rob Schmitt: Yeah.

Donald Trump: It's some of the things you do have to be there.

Rob Schmitt: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And it was -- it's a horrible war. If you would look at the things that I see with the soldiers that are being killed, soldiers are being wiped out at levels that haven't been seen certainly since the Second World War -- you know, they're very flat fields, and -- and that includes the Russian soldiers, too.

Rob Schmitt: Yeah.

Donald Trump: But Ukraine is -- is being decimated, and Russian soldiers are being killed in large numbers and -- and so are Ukrainian soldiers, Ukrainian soldiers.

Rob Schmitt: Yeah.

Donald Trump: So, it's a very sad thing. Young -- young guys are just being shot. The field is flat, and the bullet basically stops when it hits somebody, and it's hitting a lot of people. And hundreds of thousands of young soldiers are being killed, and that doesn't even talk about the cities. You know, the cities are -- they're literally knocked to the ground.

Donald Trump: It looks like a demolition. Every city looks like a demolition site.

Rob Schmitt: Yeah. Yeah.

Donald Trump: When I demolish buildings -- like in New York, I demolish a building. This is what it looks like. It's a big demolition site. Many of the cities are gone. They'll never be rebuilt. Certainly, never be rebuilt with those great golden domes and all the things that they had standing. Such history has been killed.

Donald Trump: And this is something that should have never happened.

Rob Schmitt: Yeah.

Donald Trump: This would never have happened. I would have gotten him into a room. Zelenskyy and Putin, we would have worked out a deal. Or even if you didn't work out a deal, it wouldn't have happened. This wouldn't have happened if no deal was worked out. And this was gross incompetence. That's the only reason this -- this war is taking place.

Rob Schmitt: Yeah.

Donald Trump: But we're going to do everything we can to get it stopped for both countries.

Rob Schmitt: Yeah. I want to ask you one final question, and it's about social media. It's about TikTok, which is facing this -- has to be sold by January 19th to, I guess, an American entity, or else it's going to be shut down. Is that going to happen? Is TikTok going to be sold? If it -- if it isn't sold, what are -- what are you going to do? Are you going to have an influence on this?

Donald Trump: Well, they're waiting to see what happens in the Supreme Court, Rob, as you know.

Rob Schmitt: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And so, we'll see what happens there. That's going to have a big influence on whatever is going to happen. But we'll see. Nobody really knows what that's going to be. And I will make a decision. I must say, I was on TikTok for the election, and I won the young people by 36 points. No Republicans ever won the young people.

Donald Trump: And I won by -- you saw that --

Rob Schmitt: Yeah.

Donald Trump: One of the best groups --

Rob Schmitt: Yeah.

Donald Trump: I won by 36 points. I was on TikTok. I had TikTok Jack working for me. He was a young guy, 21-years old. He was great. And we won young people. We won just about everything. But we won young people. And I think that's a big -- you know, a big credit to TikTok. So, I'm not opposed to TikTok. I think -- you know, let's see what happens.

Donald Trump: I -- I really have to wait to see what happens at the Supreme Court because nobody -- nobody knows what they can do and who's going to do it until they hear from the Supreme Court.

Rob Schmitt: Yeah.

Donald Trump: They're going to be making a ruling pretty soon.

Rob Schmitt: OK, interesting stuff.

Donald Trump: But I had a very good experience with TikTok, I would say.

Rob Schmitt: I know. But I --

Donald Trump: You know --

Rob Schmitt: The app's great. It's just -- it's who owns it and what they do with the information, I guess, is the scary part, right?

Donald Trump: There's a little truth to that, yes.

Rob Schmitt: Yeah. Yeah. Well, Mr. President, I appreciate you calling in, and it's great to hear from you. I'm excited for this weekend. Obviously, you've got a big rally on Sunday. You've got the inauguration on Monday. What a moment.

Donald Trump: Right. Well, it's going to be great, and we're going to turn it around. You know, we have a little expression that I'm sure you haven't heard of, MAGA, make America great again. You probably haven't heard that, but that expression has gone around. And I think it's going to be -- that's what we want to do. Very simple, make America great again.

Donald Trump: Because right now, we're a laughing stock --

Rob Schmitt: Yeah.

Donald Trump: All over the world, and that's not going to happen.

Rob Schmitt: Yeah, one week to go. Mr. President. Thank you so much. Good to talk to you.

Donald Trump: Thanks, Rob. Thank you very much.

Rob Schmitt: All right.

Donald Trump: Great show.
