Glenn Beck: Mr. President.

Donald Trump: Yes. Hi, Glenn.

Glenn Beck: How are you?

Donald Trump: I'm good. I'm good.

Glenn Beck: I -- I hear you just got off the phone with Elon Musk. How did that go?

Donald Trump: I did. Oh, he's great. He's -- this guy, he's in a -- he's in a world all by himself. He's a fantastic guy.

Glenn Beck: I -- we were --

Donald Trump: When I saw that -- when I saw that rocket ship come down yesterday --

Glenn Beck: Yeah.

Donald Trump: I said, "You got to be kidding," the way it landed right in --

Glenn Beck: I know.

Donald Trump: Right where it left, right? No, he's fantastic.

Glenn Beck: We were -- we were talking -- I think he is one of the great -- I mean, Steve Jobs maybe is in his category. I -- I don't think that -- I think he's the greatest mind and -- and not theoretical, actually doing stuff, in my lifetime.

Donald Trump: Absolutely. He gets it done. There's nobody like him.

Glenn Beck: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And he's a big supporter, which really --

Glenn Beck: I know.

Donald Trump: Makes me feel good. He knows what's going on. He thinks it's the most important election ever -- ever.

Glenn Beck: So, are -- are you -- have you been serious about allowing him to go in and look for cuts and everything?

Donald Trump: Oh, sure. No, you know, he's also a great businessman. I'm trying to figure out, is he a better businessman or essentially scientist, and he is [Inaudible] he feels that there's tremendous fraud --

Glenn Beck: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Waste and abuse.

Glenn Beck: There is.

Donald Trump: You know the expression fraud, waste, and abuse --

Glenn Beck: Yeah.

Donald Trump: He feels it's there. And, you know, he could save -- he could save a lot of money and --

Glenn Beck: Oh, yeah.

Donald Trump: And make lives better, OK?

Glenn Beck: Yeah.

Donald Trump: You get -- you get more for the buck. But he feels so strong -- he doesn't want to be in the cabinet or anything. He just can't do that. He's -- he's --

Glenn Beck: Yeah.

Donald Trump: You know, he's got so many things going. He wouldn't want to do that.

Glenn Beck: Right.

Donald Trump: But he would like to do something having to do with the budget and -- because there's tremendous waste.

Glenn Beck: Oh, yeah.

Donald Trump: And so [Inaudible]

Glenn Beck: And he's good at finding that.

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Glenn Beck: I mean, the way he runs his companies, I mean, it's tremendous.

Donald Trump: He's maybe the best at finding that. Oh, people love it when they hear that. Without making any dent to, you know -- and make people's lives better, actually.

Glenn Beck: Yeah.

Donald Trump: You know, make them -- make them better.

Glenn Beck: I know. It --

Donald Trump: Not worse, make them better.

Glenn Beck: It -- it really is -- is such a statement that he's probably the -- the most effective person on the planet of looking over the horizon and then bringing tomorrow into today.

Donald Trump: Right.

Glenn Beck: And the -- and the left, because he likes you, he is -- I mean, they just -- they will shut him down.

Donald Trump: Yup, they will. They'll try, but he's hard to shut down because he's --

Glenn Beck: Yeah, I know.

Donald Trump: So advanced.

Glenn Beck: Yeah.

Donald Trump: He's on a different playing field. He's so advanced. You shut him down, you shut the country down, essentially, when you look at -- look at Starlink. So, he had Starlink. And in North Carolina, they called.

Glenn Beck: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Is there any way you could call --

Glenn Beck: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And -- and some great people in North Carolina are suffering. And, you know, they have no communications, whatsoever.

Glenn Beck: I know.

Donald Trump: And I got -- I called him, and he was -- I didn't know much about Starlink other than it's supposed to be good. And I called him, and he added to them immediately. Now --

Glenn Beck: I know.

Donald Trump: They delayed him. You know, they delayed him.

Glenn Beck: We were --

Donald Trump: Actually, they put a -- they put a hold on --

Glenn Beck: I know.

Donald Trump: What he did.

Glenn Beck: We were on the ground. My -- my charity, Mercury One, was on the ground.

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Glenn Beck: We were one of the first people on the ground. We were running at -- at the height, I think we were running 50 helicopters. And we had it all, you know --

Donald Trump: Wow.

Glenn Beck: I mean, we had everything. We were there with Elon's guy when they started jerking his chain. They even came and tried to shut us down. And -- and our guy looked and said, "You know you don't have a single helicopter here. We're saving people in the mountains. If you were here maybe a week ago, sure. But we're not shutting down."

Glenn Beck: I mean, it's -- it was really tragic, what they did.

Donald Trump: It's one of the worst rescues ever and I think in league with Katrina, which was pretty bad.

Glenn Beck: Oh, yeah.

Donald Trump: Some people say it's worse. And they actually stopped people --

Glenn Beck: I think it is.

Donald Trump: Private people like you. You go in with helicopters. You want to save people.

Glenn Beck: Right.

Donald Trump: It's -- and they're not -- they didn't let them do it [Inaudible]

Glenn Beck: I know. I know.

Donald Trump: You're a little different. You know, you can do things, but --

Glenn Beck: They don't get --

Donald Trump: They don't let them do it. No, it's a terrible thing, Glenn.

Glenn Beck: I think that's --

Donald Trump: A terrible, terrible thing.

Glenn Beck: I think that's one of the biggest things that -- you know, when you say we're going to take our country back, one of the biggest things that I miss is the -- the ability to just do things that you feel are right, that are legal, but to just take control of your own life. The -- the government has grown so far out of control.

Donald Trump: Yes.

Glenn Beck: It's in every aspect of our life. And it is the problem.

Donald Trump: And it's a nasty government. It's a mean government. They weaponized government. They've done things that -- and, you know, it's interesting because the people aren't very smart, you know, the people on top.

Glenn Beck: I know.

Donald Trump: But it's the group of people that are not on top, it's the people that surround them, they are smart and they're vicious and they're fascists and everything else you can be.

Glenn Beck: So --

Donald Trump: It's a nasty group of people. Nasty.

Glenn Beck: So, somebody is -- is quite smart. I mean, sometime, historians will look back and say this was a genius. It was the biggest heist in human history.

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Glenn Beck: It was horrible, but it was genius. Who's actually the president, Mr. President?

Donald Trump: Well, I think it's a -- it's a committee of people, and they might not even know who the committee is. They may not even know themselves. Does that make sense? It's a group of people at -- that are in different levels of DC and they surround a man that was not the most capable person.

Glenn Beck: Yeah.

Donald Trump: By the way, never was.

Glenn Beck: Right.

Donald Trump: But certainly not anymore.

Glenn Beck: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And she's worse than he is. She's worse than he is. And the difference is she was a believer. You know, she was a believer for a long time.

Glenn Beck: Yeah.

Donald Trump: She was a Marxist --

Glenn Beck: Right.

Donald Trump: For a long time. She's further left than Bernie. You've heard that many times.

Glenn Beck: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Donald Trump: We talk about it. But she's further left than Pocahontas, OK? Pocahontas is probably further left than Bernie, I think. I don't know. How you -- how you rate them, might have to go by your scale. I -- I believe in your scale maybe more than mine. You know better. But -- but if you think about it, you know, we have some people -- and she is considered the most left in -- in the entire Senate and not the smartest, and not, by any means, the smartest.

Glenn Beck: But she --

Donald Trump: In fact, maybe the opposite.

Glenn Beck: But she is -- I mean, when you say she's worse -- I mean, we were talking yesterday to Mike Lee about, you know, her centerpiece legislation when she was in the Senate, which I think was called Do No Harm, and it just dismantles religious freedom, just entirely dismantles it.

Donald Trump: Right.

Glenn Beck: They are --

Donald Trump: You know, when -- when we -- we were at that group together, for the audience to know, we were -- we spent a lot of time yesterday with the Latter Day Saints and some incredible people and people of religion, too, just people of religion. And she's against religion, and it's in her -- but it's in her bones.

Donald Trump: She's against religion. And I don't know how people can vote for her. Like, we were talking about -- not so much Utah because we have such a big lead there. But we were talking about Arizona, and, you know, you take a look at Arizona. And I would certainly say Nevada. And you have a lot of Latter Day Saints, Mormons --

Glenn Beck: Yeah.

Donald Trump: In those areas. And if we got -- I think we're at 88 percent. I mean, if we got 1 percent more or 2 percent more, this whole country would turn around because if we won those two, we would be in awfully good shape to win the whole thing, as -- as you know. So, we spent time together, and it was -- it was great.

Donald Trump: And when I mentioned your name -- I will say, I mentioned Glenn's name, everyone in the place went crazy. So, that's good. They like you.

Glenn Beck: Yeah.

Donald Trump: They like you a lot. That was the big audience.

Glenn Beck: I -- it was amazing. They were electric. I mean, I --

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Glenn Beck: You know, you, at one point, leaned over to me and said, "What's your gut say?" And you know the -- you know the figures better than I do. My gut says you're accelerating at exactly the right time. And as I said to you, but for cheating. But --

Donald Trump: That's the biggest risk.

Glenn Beck: You told me that we've made a lot of good headroom -- or headway on that.

Donald Trump: Well, I think just by nature of that we don't have COVID. They used COVID to cheat. And they did so many things, so many different things. But just the fact that they didn't get legislative approval. I mean, that's -- you don't have to go any further than that. They'd actually go for legislative approval, not get it.

Donald Trump: You know, like, let's say it's a Republican legislature, right? Not get it and then do it anyway. It was just terrible. They used -- they used COVID to cheat. Now, that -- number one, that in itself makes it better now. But they're a very devious group, and you know it better than maybe anybody.

Glenn Beck: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And you talk about it more openly. A lot of people, they're afraid to talk about it. You're not afraid to talk about it. No, it's [Inaudible]

Glenn Beck: Well, once you've been threatened by George Soros -- once you've been threatened by George Soros, it kind of just everything else is kind of meh.

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Glenn Beck: You know.

Donald Trump: Have you seen his man? Gascon is down by 30 points in a poll [Inaudible]

Glenn Beck: Amen. Which is so crazy -- it's so crazy. Kamala Harris is cut from that exact same cloth.

Donald Trump: Yeah. Oh, that's -- that's a way of talking about it. You know, I had a tremendous rally the night before -- night before yesterday, and it was unbelievable. And we -- and you heard about it, 101,000 people.

Glenn Beck: Oh, yeah. Coachella.

Donald Trump: And I say if we had a honest election, if we had God coming down to be our vote counter -- wouldn't that be great if we could --

Glenn Beck: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Ask God to do it? That would be the ultimate vote counter, right, because you'd -- you'd have honesty.

Glenn Beck: Yeah.

Donald Trump: But if we had God come down, I -- I think I'd do great. I think we'd do great in California.

Glenn Beck: Oh, yeah.

Donald Trump: I think we'd win it. I think we'd win it.

Glenn Beck: Wow.

Donald Trump: You know, they send out like 38 million ballots or 36 million ballots. They go all over the place. And then they come pouring back. And it's -- you know, when you go and vote into a really good solid state where you have a real -- and they look at you and they want your ID. Even if you're Trump --

Glenn Beck: Yeah.

Donald Trump: They say, "Sir, please, could I see your license? Could I see it?"

Glenn Beck: Yeah.

Donald Trump: You know, they know it's me. They -- there's no games. You really can't get away with anything.

Glenn Beck: I know. I --

Donald Trump: There's nothing that you can get away with. They don't have computerized machines. They have paper ballots and they have voter ID and everything else, right?

Glenn Beck: Have you -- have you talked to Elon Musk about this because I think with -- I mean, you know this. We can transfer billions of dollars and not a penny is lost. We do it all day long, and it's fine. How come we can't get the technology to lock this into place, especially with blockchain?

Donald Trump: So, Elon is the No. 1 person for mechanical devices, including computers.

Glenn Beck: Yeah.

Donald Trump: There's nobody more.

Glenn Beck: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And yet, he says the only way to do it really safely is with paper ballots. You know, it's like --

Glenn Beck: Wow.

Donald Trump: Something, right? He said, "I -- I consider myself to be the world's greatest expert on all such things as this type of equipment," right?

Glenn Beck: Right.

Donald Trump: I would say I'd put him in No. 1 place. When you look at that rocket, the way it landed, that certainly put him in No. 1 place. And --

Glenn Beck: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And he's -- you know, he's --

Glenn Beck: Paper.

Donald Trump: He's concerned because those -- "You can make things swing and you can make things do a lot of bad things," he said, "but you can't do it with paper ballots when you --" you know, they have -- believe it or not, they have paper now that's actually very highly sophisticated.

Glenn Beck: Yeah, yeah. I mean --

Donald Trump: You know, very highly -- amazing --

Glenn Beck: Yeah.

Donald Trump: You know, when you hear paper, but it's very sophisticated stuff.

Glenn Beck: Yeah.

Donald Trump: But voter ID is very important, and they are now in California, as you know better than I do because you talk about it a lot. But the California thing is amazing with Gavin Newsom, where you're not even allowed to ask somebody whether or not they have voter ID.

Glenn Beck: That's crazy.

Donald Trump: If you do, I think it's like a criminal act or something. It shows our country has gone totally crazy.

Glenn Beck: So --

Donald Trump: It's gone crazy.

Glenn Beck: You and I were talking the other day about the -- the hidden Trump vote, and I -- I want to ask you your thoughts on something. I think there's actually a hidden Trump vote that is going to come from Democrats because they didn't convince people of these policies. They scared them into it. They taught them shut your mouth and just go along with it.

Glenn Beck: And I think reasonable Democrats are going "This doesn't work. I don't want my kids being talked to by, you know, a teacher in secret."

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Glenn Beck: That's -- that's -- that's the sign of a predator. I am paying more for my groceries. I can't do it anymore. And I think there's a slice of the Democrats that might tell everybody they're for Kamala but will go in and vote for you. What do you think of that?

Donald Trump: Right. So, I think the biggest thing -- you know, you see the polls, and the polls have the economy No. 1 and inflation -- I -- I view them as the same thing in a sense. I think the inflation and the economy, you could wrap them up into one. I actually think -- and I may be wrong, but, you know, I'm not wrong by much.

Glenn Beck: No.

Donald Trump: I think the biggest -- the biggest thing that people are going to be looking at and voting on is what's happening at our border, where -- where murderers are allowed to come in --

Glenn Beck: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And where drug dealers are allowed to come in and just destroy our country, literally destroy it. And inflation is a destroyer of a country, too --

Glenn Beck: Yeah.

Donald Trump: But it's a different kind of a -- it's a different kind of a destroyer. It's not as mean -- it's not as mean as having guys coming in with machine guns.

Glenn Beck: I have to --

Donald Trump: And if you look at --

Glenn Beck: Go ahead.

Donald Trump: Yes, go ahead.

Glenn Beck: Well, I was going to say, I don't know if you've heard this yet. I want to play some audio. This is Bill Clinton today talking about Laken Riley. Listen to this.

Donald Trump: Oh, wow. [Begin videotape]

Note: [Begin video clip]

Bill Clinton: [Video clip] You had a case in Georgia not very long ago, didn't you? They made an ad about it, about a young woman who'd been killed by an immigrant. [Audience member calls out "That's right"] Yeah, well, if they'd all been properly vetted, that probably wouldn't have happened. But if they're all properly vetted and that doesn't happen and America is not having enough babies to keep our populations up. [Audience member calls out "OK"]

Bill Clinton: [Video clip] So, we need immigrants that have been vetted to do work. [Audience member calls out "Right"] There wouldn't be a problem. [End videotape]

Note: [End video clip]

Glenn Beck: I mean, he sounds like he's campaigning for you.

Donald Trump: Yup. That's -- that's come a long way. You see, that's probably where they're going because they were for open borders, no talk, anybody comes in, just walk right into our country, which is insane. And now, all of a sudden, you're hearing people talking about, well, you know, we need people to come in, come in.

Donald Trump: But the damage has been done. You -- you have to understand that we have 21 million people came in. Hundreds of thousands of those people are from prisons and from gangs and drug lords and human traffickers and murderers, and they're here. So, we have a problem before -- he's a little late in saying it --

Glenn Beck: I know.

Donald Trump: Because we have a big problem. We have people in our country that are going to be murdering a lot of people. Laken Riley is a beautiful young lady. I -- I know the parents. I know everything about her. What happened to her is just horrible. But you have many, many, many cases like that, some you don't hear about but they're there.

Donald Trump: Aurora is really bad when you look at what these Venezuelan street gangs have done. They've formed and they've taken over buildings --

Glenn Beck: I know.

Donald Trump: Beautiful buildings in -- in a very good place. And they're basically in the real estate business. You know, they've taken them over with machine guns instead of with finance.

Glenn Beck: Right.

Donald Trump: It's a little different.

Glenn Beck: JD Vance was talking to Martha Raddatz. By the way --

Donald Trump: Yup. He was [Inaudible]

Glenn Beck: Brilliant pick.

Donald Trump: Yup.

Glenn Beck: And she -- he says, "Martha, are you listening to yourself? You think this little problem is -- is -- is little?" There are Venezuelan gangs --

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Glenn Beck: That are running apartment buildings in America. It's amazing what these people will try to excuse.

Donald Trump: Not believable, when you see it. JD has been great, by the way.

Glenn Beck: Oh, I love him.

Donald Trump: I have to say, he's been great. And as good as he's been, Walz, on the other side, I mean, is this man even a little intelligent? I mean, it's just -- it's just incredible. That's --

Glenn Beck: I know your -- I know your son --

Donald Trump: The combination of those two.

Glenn Beck: I know. I know your son is a hunter. You have to ask him.

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Glenn Beck: Play that video of him trying to load the shotgun. I swear to you -- I mean, I'm -- I'm fairly decent with guns. I would not hunt with that guy. He --

Donald Trump: Oh, that's right.

Glenn Beck: He looks like he's dangerous with a gun. He's never done that. It's crazy.

Donald Trump: I think he was -- I think he was a horrible pick. Now, we'll see how it works out on November 5th because one way or the other, if they -- if they won, I guess he wasn't a horrible pick. But when I heard that they picked him, I couldn't believe it. And he's only gotten worse. And she's gotten worse. So --

Glenn Beck: Yeah.

Donald Trump: You know, she's worse than Biden. I -- I really believe that she's worse than Biden. Biden was -- is superior. And they're fighting like cats and dogs, the two of them.

Glenn Beck: So, you think that's --

Donald Trump: They're fighting like cats --

Glenn Beck: You think that's true?

Donald Trump: Oh, yeah. No, well, he's angry because he got 14 million votes and he was thrown out. He -- this -- this was an overthrow of a president.

Glenn Beck: I know.

Donald Trump: This was an overthrow of an American president. There's never been anything like that before. He won the primaries.

Glenn Beck: I know.

Donald Trump: And they came to see him, and they said, "We want you out." I'm amazed he agreed to it, actually. And you know the truth is he looks better than he ever did. He looks better than he did for --

Glenn Beck: Yeah.

Donald Trump: For five years. I don't know. Somehow, he didn't play well as president, but he does play well the way he's playing against like with Ron. Ron DeSantis in Florida has done a good job.

Glenn Beck: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Very good on the hurricane. You know, it's a tough job, but he's done a very good job. But the way she went at him and just got creamed and Biden was on Ron's side.

Glenn Beck: I know. That's crazy. It's --

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Glenn Beck: And I -- you know, that's -- you know, with that Bill Clinton clip, I'm just wondering, are they just like cutting her loose?

Donald Trump: I think they're -- I -- no, I think they're trying to steer a different path now. I think they're seeing it's not working, and we've had a very good run for three weeks. And I think they're seeing it's not working. She's changed 15 major policies. You probably -- you're the all-time pro. I would say, if you've seen any -- any candidate for high office change two, it would be a lot, OK?

Glenn Beck: Oh, yeah. Well, remember, John Kerry, I think, changed one or two things --

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Glenn Beck: And he became, you know, the waffle man.

Donald Trump: That's right. No, he -- he did, but it didn't work.

Glenn Beck: No.

Donald Trump: But she's changed 15. I mean, from fracking to crime, to this, to that, to borders, which she, all of a sudden, now wants to have a strong border. And she acts like nothing happened. You know, where was she for four years, right? But -- but I've never seen anything like it. If you go back two years, just go back into -- or just go back into their primaries and listen to what she said and what she voted for, and now, every one of those things have -- have been thrown out.

Donald Trump: So, I don't know. You know, I mean, let's see what happens. I can't imagine you could get away with it. But there's another thing, it's called competence. And, you know, she -- they tried the threat to democracy with me. They tried it all. They tried everything. But let's look at now their competence.

Donald Trump: The woman is not a competent person, and I think far less competent than Biden, and I would never thought -- I never thought I'd be saying it. But there's something going on. I mean, I watched her with a teleprompter. Her teleprompter broke and she kept going 32, 32.

Glenn Beck: That was amazing.

Donald Trump: And I said -- no, I said, "What's going on with her?"

Glenn Beck: I know.

Donald Trump: And --

Glenn Beck: You -- you've been in television. I've been in television.

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Glenn Beck: We know teleprompters.

Donald Trump: Yup.

Glenn Beck: She had no idea what the next sentence was. She was saying 32 as if, hey, prompter person, I'm at the bottom of the page. It was crazy.

Donald Trump: If that -- and -- and you know what, she could even say, "My teleprompter went off."

Glenn Beck: Yes.

Donald Trump: And sometimes, I do that, and then you go on to make your speech.

Glenn Beck: Right.

Donald Trump: You know, you can't sit there. You can't walk off the stage, right?

Glenn Beck: No.

Donald Trump: But -- but a teleprompter is one of the most unreliable pieces of equipment. I can tell you.

Glenn Beck: Yeah, I know.

Donald Trump: You know, sometimes -- like the crowd we had -- we had. That was a big crowd. The night before, I had 101,000 people. And you can lose those -- I figure teleprompters go out 5 percent of the time and 2 or 3 percent of the time where they're just gone. I mean, I've had them blow off the stage. You know, if it's windy, they're not very good because they move like a sail.

Donald Trump: You can't -- they're very hard to hold back. They move. If a teleprompter is moving, you can't -- I don't use a teleprompter that much, anyway. But if a teleprompter is moving, it's a problem. But you've got to be -- if you're going to be in politics, you have to be able to -- if and when, because it's when, but if and when the teleprompter goes, you know this, you've got to be able to speak, and she was frozen.

Donald Trump: And she's lucky that thing came back because, you know, it snapped back. It's called a snapback.

Glenn Beck: Yeah.

Donald Trump: It snapped back for her, and she then started continuing to read.

Glenn Beck: I -- I wish it wouldn't have. I would have loved to see how she would have ended that.

Donald Trump: Well, I think it would have been a bad thing.

Glenn Beck: Yeah.

Donald Trump: She was -- she was at -- she couldn't have done the 32 one more time. I don't know. It would have been bad.

Glenn Beck: So --

Donald Trump: She had exhausted the number 32, I can tell you, right?

Glenn Beck: So -- so what -- what frightens, at least me, is she's not in control --

Donald Trump: No.

Glenn Beck: Biden is not in control, and they're talking about changing our nuclear strategy with Russia.

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Glenn Beck: And I don't know who's making those decisions. And I have to tell you, Mr. President -- I mean -- you know, have you read "Nuclear War" by Annie Jacobsen?

Donald Trump: Yes, I have.

Glenn Beck: OK.

Donald Trump: Yes.

Glenn Beck: That's terrifying. I don't know how you would make the decision as president of the United States that quickly.

Donald Trump: It's the -- it's the biggest single threat -- when these people talk about global warming and they worry about the oceans going to rise in 300 years by an eighth of an inch, it's like -- it just infuriates. Now, at the same time, I don't even like talking about nuclear.

Glenn Beck: Right.

Donald Trump: That's how bad it is, OK? So, you know, during my administration, you probably never heard the word nuclear. I don't --

Glenn Beck: No.

Donald Trump: I purposely -- and now you're hearing it every single day. You're hearing it all the time. And you know who issues it a lot? It's Putin now, he's issuing that word.

Glenn Beck: I know. I know.

Donald Trump: And that will be -- there will never have been anything like that, the -- the level of power. I'm the one that rebuilt it. I rebuilt all of our military. I rebuilt it at the highest level. I hated -- in many ways, I hated to have to do the nuclear, but I did because we have no choice.

Glenn Beck: Right.

Donald Trump: We have other countries -- we have five other countries now that are, as they say, nuclear-capable, and that's too many. That's actually five too many. The -- the truth is I think I would have had a deal with Russia and with China to denuclearize their stock. I really think we would have had that. All three of us agreed on it conceptually, and I think we would have done that.

Donald Trump: But COVID came along and we had to fight that battle. And we fought it well. Never got credit for it, really, but we fought it well. I got credit for the economy. I got credit for the military. We knocked out ISIS and got the biggest tax cuts and regulation cuts and all that. But I never got -- you know -- and nobody knew what this was. COVID came in. It was a gift from China.

Glenn Beck: I -- I got to --

Donald Trump: [Inaudible]

Glenn Beck: I got to tell you, the way they -- the way they say that you didn't do enough when they were the ones bitching when you said, "I got to close to China. We can't have this happening." And they -- they called you a bigot and everything. And now, they're saying, "You didn't close it fast enough." I mean --

Donald Trump: Yup.

Glenn Beck: Are we -- do they really believe the American people are goldfish? I mean --

Donald Trump: Well, the same people -- Nancy Pelosi -- crazy Nancy, she was going crazy when I said, "If I didn't close it from China then --" And you know what, there were 11 people in the room, and I was the only one that said I want it closed, and you had to close it. We would have lost probably a couple of million people more, and -- and we really -- I mean, we would have lost millions of people more had I not done that.

Donald Trump: That was a great move. But, you know, nobody knew what this thing was, and everybody got hurt. You know, proportionately, a lot of -- there was a lot of equals, OK? They all got hurt. China ended up getting hurt very late in the process. You know, it looked like China almost skirted the issue. It has really hurt China.

Donald Trump: It's -- it's hurting it right now because what they -- you know, they went through it very, very -- now, they were different. They locked them in and they welded the doors closed.

Glenn Beck: I know.

Donald Trump: And they forgot --

Glenn Beck: I know.

Donald Trump: Or something happened.

Glenn Beck: Yeah.

Donald Trump: You know, people died of starvation. Can you believe that?

Glenn Beck: It's China.

Donald Trump: They welded them in their apartments.

Glenn Beck: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And then they either forgot or something happened, but they didn't un-weld them until it was too late. It's unbelievable. It's unbelievable. But that was a terrible thing.

Glenn Beck: I have been bitching and complaining about the Secret Service for -- well, since Obama. We have -- we have not been protecting our presidents rightly. I mean, my -- my people have gotten around the Secret Service. However, I will tell you this. This weekend, I have never seen anything like the security that you have around you now.

Glenn Beck: It is top shelf. And they said that you asked the president for rocket launchers or something to protect your plane in case somebody shoots a rocket at the plane. Is that true?

Donald Trump: Well, I -- I better not get into it --

Glenn Beck: OK.

Donald Trump: But -- but they have very strong security around the plane.

Glenn Beck: Yeah, I know. I saw it.

Donald Trump: They have very strong security. And -- and they really -- I mean, they have to. The one thing that we don't have is we haven't had a president saying if some country and Iran, where there is actually a threat, that if they do anything to -- not -- it's not me, it's the president.

Glenn Beck: Yeah. I know.

Donald Trump: You know, former presidents and, now, in leading in both parties to -- to be president. If they do anything that -- we're going to obliterate the country because when you say that, that's the end of that. They won't do anything. But we haven't heard that. And other presidents have issued, you know, like --

Glenn Beck: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Proclamations, as you probably have heard. There were two or three issued that way where -- even rivals, rivals were being threatened and --

Glenn Beck: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Certain presidents were able to get up and say, "If you do this, we're going to hit you --"

Glenn Beck: Right.

Donald Trump: So hard that you won't have a country left.

Glenn Beck: Right.

Donald Trump: And when you do that, they tend to say, "Well, let's take a pass," right?

Glenn Beck: Yeah. Yeah.

Donald Trump: That's the way it works. But Biden is not -- is not -- I guess he's not willing to do that, and that's pretty, pretty sad. I would do it for him. I will tell you, if he were -- if it were reversed and I was where he was and it was, you know, him, I would issue such a proclamation against them.

Glenn Beck: You have to. You have to.

Donald Trump: Otherwise, we don't have a country. You don't have a country.

Glenn Beck: Yeah, you don't.

Donald Trump: We're not going to have a country. So --

Glenn Beck: You don't. The Coachella guy who was -- he says he was a big fan, but they found guns in his car. I don't even know if this reached you. The campaign says it really wasn't anything. Local sheriffs said they felt that they had stopped a third assassination attempt. Any -- anything on that?

Donald Trump: No, I don't know. He said he was a big fan, and I know that, and -- but he had some pretty nasty weapons in his car.

Glenn Beck: Yeah. Right.

Donald Trump: But he was away from the car, and the car was parked a long ways away. Everybody who was at the place was -- I mean, we had 101 -- I guess more than that, but over 101,000 people there. So, it was a big crowd. He was very far away. But -- but, you know, it's -- when you have that kind of weapons in the car, it's a little -- it's not your -- these were not your standard weapons. Let's put it that way, right?

Glenn Beck: Yeah, yeah.

Donald Trump: They were not the greatest. So, you know, it's -- we're living in a dangerous world. This is a world that's very dangerous. This is a world that's closer to World War III than we've ever been. There's never been anything like it. And the problem is, like we said, the weaponry is at a level -- I always say it's not two Army tanks running around a field shooting at each other.

Glenn Beck: Yeah.

Donald Trump: This is -- this is weaponry that I -- that I know better than anybody because I see it. I rebuilt it. And this is weapons and weaponry that nobody's -- no -- it's not even imaginable. And we really need smart people in government now. We just can't go through another four years like we did with Biden.

Donald Trump: You know, I had Iran wanting to make a deal. They were going to make a deal. I would have had a deal done within one week of the election. They were -- they didn't have money. They were -- there was no Hezbollah. There was no Hamas. Because there was no fighting, you know, they couldn't give them money.

Donald Trump: They were there, but they didn't have any money. And we had a -- the best situation. He could have made a deal in one week, and a big part of the deal was no nuclear weapons, right? That was 90 percent of the deal. No, I want them to do great. I wanted Iran to do great. But no -- they're great people. The -- you know, Iran, they're great people.

Glenn Beck: Yeah.

Donald Trump: I know so many Iranian -- Iranians that are now living in America. They're like really great people.

Glenn Beck: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Smart as can be.

Glenn Beck: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And wonderful and warm. So, we don't want to have a problem. But they -- they were broke. They had no money. I said, "Nope. Can't do that." And you know why. It's -- they had no money because of my policy. And --

Glenn Beck: Right.

Donald Trump: And -- and they would have made a deal. They would have made a deal. I would have made that deal within a week after the election. And -- and I want -- I want them to be really successful as a country. It's all good. But the -- one thing, they can't have nuclear weapons.

Glenn Beck: So --

Donald Trump: And now, they're like a month away from having a nuclear weapon. That's a real big -- that's a big problem. Now, we'll see what's going on with Israel, who I think their stock has gone up very high --

Glenn Beck: Oh, yeah.

Donald Trump: In the last month or so.

Glenn Beck: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Their stock has gone up very high as fighters. But it's very, very sad to see what's happened, that -- that they would allow this to happen. Look, if I were president, Ukraine would not have been attacked by Russia, 100 percent.

Glenn Beck: I know. Boris Johnson just said that.

Donald Trump: He wouldn't have had [Inaudible]

Glenn Beck: Did you see the Boris Johnson interview?

Donald Trump: I did.

Glenn Beck: Yeah.

Donald Trump: I did. He said that.

Glenn Beck: Yeah.

Donald Trump: He said, "If Trump were there, it would have never happened."

Glenn Beck: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And it wouldn't have.

Glenn Beck: It wouldn't have.

Donald Trump: And I got along well with Putin. But it would just would have never happened. What a shame. What a different world. You know what else wouldn't have happened? Inflation. The most embarrassing day in the history of our country wouldn't have happened --

Glenn Beck: Oh, my gosh.

Donald Trump: With Afghanistan.

Glenn Beck: Yeah.

Donald Trump: It wouldn't have happened.

Glenn Beck: You know, you were -- you were talking about that the other day, and I -- I have to correct one thing that you said.

Donald Trump: Go ahead.

Glenn Beck: In Afghanistan, again, my charity was over. We had the -- we -- we ran the airport over -- over there, and we had all of the commercial airplanes ready to go. And the State Department kept screwing us. And I mean, we -- in the end, we got 22,000 people out.

Donald Trump: Oh, wow.

Glenn Beck: And none of them came to America because we didn't even trust our vetting --

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Glenn Beck: But we knew who we were bringing out. The -- the State Department screwed us around, screwed us around. They actually mocked us at one point and said, "Well, you need one more form," and they came up with a new form. We said, "We don't even know -- we've never heard of that form. Where do we get it?" And they said, "At the embassy in Kabul."

Glenn Beck: And we're like, "You closed the embassy." They actually laughed and said, "I guess you're just going to have to figure that out," and hung up on us. So, we finally made a deal with them. You said yesterday, they -- they got all of the soldiers out. No, sir. To get the -- the survivors that we tried to get out, the 22,000 --

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Glenn Beck: Our first plane had to be full of American soldiers that they left behind. That is -- that is crazy.

Donald Trump: Well, I meant was that they took the soldiers out early.

Glenn Beck: Yeah.

Donald Trump: The American soldiers, they left.

Glenn Beck: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And we were left without soldiers. And they should have taken the soldiers out last.

Glenn Beck: Right.

Donald Trump: They should have been the last to go.

Glenn Beck: Right. But they --

Donald Trump: You know, when I spoke to Abdul, I said, "No, you're not going to do any more." You know, they were shooting a lot -- they were killing a lot of our soldiers --

Glenn Beck: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And other people. And I had a very tough conversation with him. And I -- from that point on, 18 months and we didn't have one -- you know that.

Glenn Beck: No, no, no. Wait, you can't -- you can't -- you have to tell the story about the picture. You cannot just gloss over this. This is one of the greatest -- this is one of the greatest negotiating things I've ever heard. Tell the whole story.

Donald Trump: Well, I had a -- I had a conversation, and it was important to have it and -- because the Taliban, that's where the killing is. Like, I always say, Jesse James, they -- he liked banks. And they say, "Jesse, Jesse, why do you always go after a bank?" He said, "Because that's where the money is," right? And in this case, the Taliban, because that's who was doing all the killing in Afghanistan.

Donald Trump: You know that was the killing arm, right? So, I spoke to the head, he's still there, Abdul. We had a good conversation, tough conversation because they were killing a lot of American soldiers. And they were with Obama and Biden, but they were really killing a lot of them. And I got there, and it got lighter, but they were killing them and a lot of snipers.

Donald Trump: And I had a conversation -- a couple of conversations, but I had a conversation. And I don't want to go graphically, the conversation. It was a tough conversation. But I -- you can't really repeat it. It's not appropriate. But -- but I had a conversation and I essentially told them don't do it, don't do it. And --

Glenn Beck: Can I tell --

Donald Trump: I did have -- I did have -- I -- yeah, you could tell it, but I did send him something that was interesting. Go ahead.

Glenn Beck: Yeah. So, you had -- you had a picture of his house and you said, "If any of our soldiers die, I will kill you." And you put the picture down and slid it across the table and then you walked out. I think that's brilliant, just brilliant.

Donald Trump: Well, it was a phone conversation --

Glenn Beck: Oh, OK.

Donald Trump: But it was a phone conversation, and it was -- it was sent to him. And he said, "But why, but why do you send me a picture of my house," during the phone conversation. And -- and I said, "That you'll have to figure out." But we had --

Glenn Beck: That's great.

Donald Trump: Regardless, we had no problem at all. So, we went 18 months, not one American soldier was killed or even shot at. And after 18 months, they did this horrible --

Glenn Beck: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Move. And it was so bad. And, you know, we also gave up Bagram. So, Bagram is one of the biggest bases in the world. We gave it up, and China is now occupying it. Can you imagine?

Glenn Beck: Yeah.

Donald Trump: The reason I wanted it -- I would never have left that. I was planning on --

Glenn Beck: No.

Donald Trump: Making, you know, upgrades. What happened with Bagram is it's one hour where they make -- from where China makes its nuclear weapons. What an asset. And now, China is occupying it. Can you believe it? They gave it up. They left at the dark of night. They left the lights on, and they left this massive thing that cost us billions and billions of dollars, the longest runways in the world, very powerful runway.

Donald Trump: It's thick, like eight feet thick of concrete. You can land anything on it. And we -- we left -- we -- we -- we just walked away from it. And what a great thing. I would never have done that. I was -- we were having it staffed up and everything. We would have left with strength and dignity. It wouldn't have been people falling off airplanes. Yeah, very sad, very, very sad, what happened.

Glenn Beck: They're the -- they're the --

Donald Trump: I think it was the most embarrassing day in the history of our country.

Glenn Beck: It was, at least in my lifetime.

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Glenn Beck: If -- if -- we -- we left the -- a lot of our arms and everything else there. Is it true they're now one of the largest arms dealers in the world?

Donald Trump: Yes.

Glenn Beck: Selling the arms we left behind.

Donald Trump: So -- so, we left billions and billions and billions of dollars of brand-new beautiful equipment, tanks, trucks, thousands of trucks, many of them armor-plated. They're million-dollar trucks, you know.

Glenn Beck: Why wouldn't we at least blow them up before we left?

Donald Trump: Because Milley was stupid. Milley said the same thing to me. I said, "Now, we're going to take --" "Sir, I think it's stupid. We'll leave it behind." I said, "Wait a minute. If you have an airplane and it's new and it costs $150 million to build it, you're not going to put a tank of jet fuel in there and fly it out to Pakistan or directly home?" "Sir, I think it's stupid. We'll leave it."

Donald Trump: He was such a stupid guy. He was so stupid. It was so -- he had no common sense. You know the expression I say? The Republican Party is the party of common sense. Milley was a stupid guy. And I could just see him telling that to Biden and Biden believing it because we left all of that equipment behind.

Donald Trump: Now, if you look, three weeks ago, they had a parade.

Glenn Beck: Yeah.

Donald Trump: They have a parade every year.

Glenn Beck: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Running the equipment right down the middle of their boulevard and all beautiful, you know, American trucks and all -- mostly armor-plated stuff, very, very expensive to build and very expensive equipment, riding it down like in a parade, talking about the dumb Americans. No, he -- what he -- what he has done to the country is such a shame, between the borders and Afghanistan and allowing the war.

Donald Trump: Putin never would have done that war. And now, you look at Ukraine. I mean, it's like a demolition site. The cities are knocked to the ground. Those beautiful golden towers are crushed and laying on their sides. They were beautiful. I mean, what -- you can never rebuild it. You can never rebuild -- it's -- you know, a whole civilization has been lost.

Glenn Beck: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Because don't forget, those cities have been obliterated.

Glenn Beck: Gone.

Donald Trump: So many of them.

Glenn Beck: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And, you know, it's one thing, peace. What does -- what does it mean? So many of the people have left. So many of the people have died. Many more people have died in Ukraine than they talk about. You know, they'll -- they'll have missiles hitting buildings, and they'll say two people were hurt. You know, the building will collapse.

Donald Trump: And those are big buildings. Those are buildings that are like two or three city blocks, normal New York City blocks. They are big buildings. I was amazed at the size of the apartment. That's what I did for a living, right? And they -- these were big apartment houses, fairly tall, but really long, and they had a lot of people.

Donald Trump: And they were hitting them with missiles, the buildings would collapse, just collapse right down to the ground, and they'd say two people were hurt. No, no, many, many people were killed.

Glenn Beck: So --

Donald Trump: When the -- when the death toll is really said in Ukraine, the numbers are going to be much higher than people think.

Glenn Beck: You just said something that made me think of, and I know you got to go, so we'll -- we'll keep this short. But the -- you just said, "You know, what I do is I -- you know, I build buildings," and -- and it made me think of the hotels in New York that are now trashing their hotels with illegals. What's the game here? What -- what is the --

Donald Trump: Well, the owners of the hotels are now operating a different product. So, they used to operate luxury hotels. And now, they operate them to get government money. And they're making more money than they -- they have 100 percent occupancy at room rates that are higher than they ever got and they have illegal migrants living in the buildings.

Donald Trump: And you don't want to walk in there, Glenn, because you will probably not have a good chance of getting out. It's rough stuff going on. I have friends that own these things. And they used to be luxury. And now, what they are is their hotels and -- you know, a lot of people won't go back into those hotels, too, you know, in terms of your luxury guests, if that ever comes back.

Glenn Beck: Oh, yeah.

Donald Trump: But these people are making a fortune. All they do is keep sending the government bills. And here's the saddest part. Outside of those hotels, as the migrants walk into these buildings that were luxury but are being beat up and destroyed -- you know there are fights in there all the time.

Glenn Beck: Oh, yeah.

Donald Trump: Rough stuff. Rough, rough stuff. It's -- these are tough people. These are not -- these are rough, rough people. They make our criminals look like babies. But if you ever -- look, we have our veterans living on the sidewalk right outside the main entrance and you have migrants going into the hotels. How about that? And so, the military should never vote for her.

Donald Trump: And frankly, I don't think anybody should. People of religion shouldn't. The Latter Day Saints should not. That's why we were there.

Glenn Beck: Yeah.

Donald Trump: We want to get that vote. Will you please get me that vote, Glenn?

Glenn Beck: I don't know I can. OK.

Donald Trump: You can't let them -- I'll tell you, you cannot let them -- who could vote? Any religion.

Glenn Beck: I know.

Donald Trump: I don't know what it is with the Catholics, but they're really after the Catholics.

Glenn Beck: I know.

Donald Trump: How could a Catholic vote for them, you know?

Glenn Beck: I don't know. I don't know.

Donald Trump: It's -- it's a very sad time. But we will have more conversations anytime.

Glenn Beck: Yup.

Donald Trump: You've been a great guy and you've really been --

Glenn Beck: I -- I --

Donald Trump: Just terrific.

Glenn Beck: I mean this, Mr. President. I -- I do this for my children. I will door knock for you. You just tell me how I can help. I will be there. Thank you for everything.

Donald Trump: Well, you can keep that voice -- you keep your voice going. That's the most important thing. You have a very powerful voice and good voice, and it's for good.

Glenn Beck: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And I appreciate it very much.

Glenn Beck: You bet. We'll talk again.

Donald Trump: Thank you very much.

Glenn Beck: Thank you.

Donald Trump: Thank you, Glenn.

Glenn Beck: You bet. Bye-bye.

Donald Trump: OK. Bye.
