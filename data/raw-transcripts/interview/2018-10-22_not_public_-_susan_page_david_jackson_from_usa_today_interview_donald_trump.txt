Note: [Susan Page and David Jackson interview Donald Trump aboard Air Force One on October 22, 2018. Quotes from the interview were published, but neither a recording or transcript of the interview were published.]

Note: [We did not receive a response from Page, but Jackson indicated he would look into the transcript, but we have not heard back since that contact. As the record for the interview is not complete, as a policy, we do not index the edited pieces.]
