Note: [David Boyer and S.A. Miller conducted an interview with Donald Trump on November 1, 2018 at The White House. The Washington Times published quotes, but did not publish a transcript of the interview or make a recording available.]

Note: [We did not hear back from either Boyer or Miller in regard to the availability of the full transcript. As the record for the interview is not complete, as a policy, we do not index the edited pieces.]
