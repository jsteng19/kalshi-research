Rachel Campos-Duffy: Why did you want to be the first sitting president to address the March?

Donald Trump: Well, I didn't do it for that reason. But, you know, a lot of groups are under siege in our country and they have been for a long time before I got here. You know, what was happening is things are changing too rapidly and not good. And so I saw them, they wanted me to make a tape that they play. And I've done it for three years now.

Donald Trump: And I said, you know, I'm in Washington. Maybe I'll just instead of making a tape, I'll go over. Now, I didn't know it's was gonna be this big of a deal, but they have a lot of people out there and it turned out to be very successful, the most successful one by far.

Rachel Campos-Duffy: Your administration just announced that they're going to challenge California over their abortion requirements and their insurance. Why did you make such a bold move? That's going to make a lot of people angry and, you know, Planned Parenthood is spend $45 million [Inaudible]?

Donald Trump: I think we have a group of people that are just amazing and they've been with us and we've been with them. And we want to do what's right. We want to do what we feel is right.

Rachel Campos-Duffy: [Not on video. On Covington High School student Nicholas Sandmann returning to the March for Life on the anniversary of the confrontation at last year's rally]

Donald Trump: Nicholas is a great young man and the Covington High School students were-- they weren't causing any trouble. And you could see it was building and building and building -- I hope he got a good settlement. Very unfair.
