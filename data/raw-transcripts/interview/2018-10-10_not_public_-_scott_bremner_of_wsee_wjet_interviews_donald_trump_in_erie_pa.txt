Note: [Scott Bremner of WSEE / WJET in Erie interviewed Donald Trump prior to a rally in Erie, Pennsylvania on October 10, 2018.]

Note: [WSEE / WJET has elected to only release a handful of highly edited snippets of the interview, where the original question cannot be heard and Trump's answers are cut.]

Note: [Because WSEE/WJET has the entire audio, but has elected to not make the full interview or recordings available, nor respond to inquiries, our editorial policy is to exclude it from the index. This is a  reflection of our focus to be able to present interviews in their full context.]

Note: [The snippets of the Interview can be found online here: https://www.yourerie.com/news/local-news/exclusive-one-on-one-interview-with-president-trump/1515024679]
