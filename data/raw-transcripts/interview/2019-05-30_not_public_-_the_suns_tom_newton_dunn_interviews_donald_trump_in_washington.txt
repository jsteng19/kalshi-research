Note: [The Sun (UK) published excerpts of its interview with Donald Trump at The White House prior to his trip to the United Kingdom and France. These excerpts are available online.]

Note: [Tom Newtown Dunn emailed to state all pertinent material is available in his stories. He did not respond to further requests to publish the full interview.]

Note: [Because The Sun (UK) has the entire interview, but has elected not to publish it in full, our editorial policy is to exclude it from the index. This is not a reflection on The Sun but rather a reflection of our focus to be able to present interviews in their full context.]
