Travis Miller: He has 15-plus luxury properties all around the world, and we've hosted many of our charity events at these properties. And so, we're excited to meet up with the man and talk about, you know, his rise in the golf world but also his game.

Donald Trump: Look at that. Who would believe that? You think Joe Biden -- you think Joe Biden can do that?

Travis Miller: I don't think so.

Donald Trump: I don't think so.

Travis Miller: All right, we're excited and honored to be here with the 45th president of the United States and soon to be 47th.

Donald Trump: Could happen.

Travis Miller: Yeah, absolutely.

Donald Trump: Stranger things have happened.

Travis Miller: Well, you're a -- you're busy man, you've been traveling all over the country campaigning. And just this week, you've been in tons of states. You went down and visited our southern border.

Donald Trump: Right.

Travis Miller: So, you're very, very busy. So, we appreciate your time.

Donald Trump: And the southern border is a dangerous place.

Travis Miller: Yeah.

Donald Trump: It wouldn't be a good place for a golf club. I can tell you.

Travis Miller: I don't think so. Yeah, I would want to --

Donald Trump: You wouldn't last long. You wouldn't last long.

Travis Miller: Well, I know you do a lot of interviews with the media, fake news, and talk about politics, policy today. I wanted to kind of do something fun and talk about something that you love and you're very passionate about, which is the game of golf.

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Travis Miller: So, does that sound good to you?

Donald Trump: Sure.

Travis Miller: So, I've read somewhere that you've started picking up the game around your college years. Is that correct?

Donald Trump: Around college. I went to the Wharton School of Finance at Penn. And around college, yeah, I started picking it up and enjoyed it, pretty much learned it learned how to play on some public courses in Philadelphia today. I don't think you could go there today. It would be a little bit tougher.

Travis Miller: Yeah.

Donald Trump: But in those days, it was so safe, it was so perfect. It was like life is supposed to be, right?

Travis Miller: Yeah, absolutely.

Donald Trump: And Cobbs Creek and Karakung, two courses that are right next to each other. And they were -- they were sort of cool. And they had a lot of good players, a lot of hustling players from the area. And I had a lot of fun with that. It was good.

Travis Miller: Was there anybody in your family or friends that influenced you or pushed you into the sport?

Donald Trump: Not for golf, my father, I played with him once. He didn't play golf. But he had an unbelievably good swing. I mean, if he played golf, he would have been phenomenal.

Travis Miller: Yeah.

Donald Trump: He had a great swing. I never forgot. I said you, "You never played? Are you kidding me? You never played?" And he was really good. He could have been really good.

Travis Miller: Yeah.

Donald Trump: You know, one of the people that if he -- but he was a worker and not a golfer. But if he played golf -- I will never forget, when I played with him, how good a swing he had.

Travis Miller: So fast forward through your college years, I mean, the world knows Donald Trump as a real estate mogul, entrepreneur, TV personality, and, obviously, the president of the United States.

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Travis Miller: But you are a powerhouse in the golf industry, too. You guys have nearly 20, you know, luxury properties --

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Travis Miller: All around the world, and we've had the pleasure to go shoot a lot of those. And the world-class, you know, white-glove service, red carpet experience that you expect.

Donald Trump: Yeah, we hope.

Travis Miller: In 1999, you broke ground and started with your properties in West Palm Beach.

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Travis Miller: What made you want to get into golf course design and, you know, the golf operations?

Donald Trump: Well, it just was an opportunity. Actually, the first one was Westchester.

Travis Miller: OK.

Donald Trump: And I got Westchester and then I got Palm Beach. And Westchester was a course in a great location, Briarcliff manor, considered one of the best locations in Westchester. And it was an existing course. And it was public and always was successful because the location is so good.

Travis Miller: Yeah.

Donald Trump: You know, if you have a good location, you don't even have to have a good course. And this was just a simple course, but it had a lot of land. And I said, "Boy, would that be good for a really luxury course?" And I got it approved, got it zoned. It was not easy. I will tell you, it was tough, actually tough community to get things done.

Donald Trump: But I got it done and built it. But pretty much, simultaneously, I did the Palm Beach course, which has been a success. Both of them have been a success from the day I built them.

Travis Miller: Yeah, I mean, you guys have hosted tons of tournaments, major championships --

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Travis Miller: At a variety of courses. I mean, it's fun to hear the stories from all the GMs and the superintendents about your involvement and your eye for detail. You truly are a visionary. And, you know, what makes you feel -- what -- what has helped you get to that point where -- when you see a course, the creativity that you have to put these designs together?

Donald Trump: Well, I've always had that, and I have that with buildings and I've had that with other things. I am -- you know, I like to think of myself as a very creative person. A lot of people wouldn't understand that. They would say, "Really? I didn't know that." But I am. I mean, this range was almost nonexistent.

Donald Trump: And it sounds simple, a range, but it's really not simple. It's complex, especially when you have a lot of things to go through with cities and towns and, you know, zoning and environmental and all the things you have to do.

Travis Miller: Yeah.

Donald Trump: But, yeah, we've had -- we've had tremendous reviews on properties. We're building one right now in Scotland, the second one to Trump International in Aberdeen.

Travis Miller: I've heard it's going to be great.

Donald Trump: It is unbelievable. It's just -- I was given the land. I was -- I bought the land years ago and got it zoned, took years to get it zoned. Sean Connery was the one that got it zoned for me because we were five years the biggest dunes, I think the biggest dunes probably in the world. And they're in Scotland.

Travis Miller: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And Scotland's known for dunes, but not necessarily the biggest ones. It should have the biggest.

Travis Miller: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And these are the great dunes of Scotland. And everyone told me, "You couldn't get it zoned. It would be impossible." You couldn't even walk on them. They wouldn't let you walk on them. And I got it zoned. I got it zoned for two courses, and I built the one. It was very successful. And then, the other one.

Donald Trump: The zoning was running out. I had like two months to start it a year ago. I said, "Well, you'll never get it zoned again, that I can tell you." And so, if I start it, we'll be fine. And if I don't start it, well, you know, you'll lose it. So, we actually started it for that reason. Very complicated deal.

Donald Trump: And I'll never forget, after five years, it looked like we weren't going to get it. And Sean Connery, the great actor --

Travis Miller: That's amazing.

Donald Trump: James Bond, the original James Bond --

Travis Miller: James Bond.

Donald Trump: Who's from Scotland, very much -- he's the king of -- I call him the king of Scotland. But he came along. And I met him a couple of times. I liked him and he liked me, and he was watching this whole process for years, go a long, long -- it was, you know, big environmental mess. And he said, "Let the bloody bloke build his golf club, let him build. He wants to invest money in Scotland. Let him build his bloody golf course."

Donald Trump: I'll never forget it. And as soon as he said that, everything -- I got everything.

Travis Miller: Started moving.

Donald Trump: I called him, I said you're the most -- you're the greatest zoning lawyer I've ever had. As soon as he said that, they held a special session, they approved everything. So, anyway, so they gave me a long period of time to do the second. And a few months ago, we started it, and it's going to be incredible.

Donald Trump: It'll be equal -- I said, "Let's make them." You can't -- you cannot do better --

Travis Miller: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Than that course. It's incredible. But I said, "Let's make it as good as opposed to making a, you know, a poor brother."

Travis Miller: Yeah, no, I can't wait to see it. I mean a lot of the properties we visited the stories --

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Travis Miller: Behind the start of it --

Donald Trump: A lot of great stories.

Travis Miller: And what you've done for the lands and --

Donald Trump: Well, I have great locations. In Los Angeles, you know I have 600 acres on the ocean.

Travis Miller: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And I don't need it because we never advertise because it's always full. I think it gets the most per round. It's a daily fee or a public course.

Travis Miller: Yeah.

Donald Trump: You can't take them actually private along the ocean over there. That's why Pebble Beach is, you know, basically --

Travis Miller: It's public as well.

Donald Trump: It's a public course.

Travis Miller: Yeah.

Donald Trump: But -- and I think I'd rather not. Actually, I like it the way it is, but it does tremendous business. But that course is unbelievable. And we have a little ad that we would have used. I have the ocean, Pebble Beach has the bay, OK, which is true.

Travis Miller: Yeah.

Donald Trump: I have the ocean.

Travis Miller: At least you've got the ocean view on all 18.

Donald Trump: No, no, I'm on the ocean. I mean, this is on the ocean --

Travis Miller: Yeah.

Donald Trump: For tremendous spans. I mean, every hole -- every hole is on the ocean.

Travis Miller: Yeah.

Donald Trump: But I say I have the ocean, Pebble Beach has the bay. But so far, I've never advertised because, you know --

Travis Miller: You don't need to.

Donald Trump: You don't need to.

Travis Miller: You are getting high tee times there.

Donald Trump: We are getting --

Travis Miller: People and the demand is there, so --

Donald Trump: That's true.

Travis Miller: Yeah, so changing gears to you personally playing, you know, on the internet, you know, as well as anybody, there's a lot of haters. I call them keyboard warriors.

Donald Trump: Right, right.

Travis Miller: And a lot of people have things to say about your game. Well, recently, you kind of put it on full display playing with Bryson DeChambeau in the Break 50.

Donald Trump: Yeah, we did good, we got 50. From the women's tees.

Travis Miller: Yeah.

Donald Trump: It's nice when you have a guy who can drive greens, you know.

Travis Miller: Well, he's not -- he's -- I think someone shot 50 with him one other time, so --

Donald Trump: Yeah, I know it's -- it's the best score they've had, 50. We shot a 50. I mean Sergio shot 56. I think Sergio is such a good guy.

Travis Miller: He is --

Donald Trump: I said, Sergio, come on, give me a break, right? But, you know, it's hard to do. You need 15 birdies and five eagles --

Travis Miller: Yeah.

Donald Trump: to break it.

Travis Miller: Par 3 is what's tough.

Donald Trump: And the hard ones are par 3s --

Travis Miller: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Because even if you're -- you know, you're playing for the women's here. But even if you're 150, 160 yards, you got to put it --

Travis Miller: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And you got to make a birdie, and it's not that easy.

Travis Miller: I mean, you're hitting every fairway. You're chipping --

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Travis Miller: Making putts left and right. So, a couple holes, Bryson didn't even need to do anything, so --

Donald Trump: Yeah, no, I had a couple. And I mean, look, let's never underestimate Bryson. He played -- he played great. He's a great putter, too. You know people don't know about Bryson, he's -- number one, he's a fantastic guy, but he can really putt --

Travis Miller: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And a lot of people talk about his distance, and he's the longest on the tour.

Travis Miller: Yeah.

Donald Trump: I know him all. I mean, I know the guys. He's actually the longest. And -- and he's very straight, hits it great, but he is a fantastic putter.

Travis Miller: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And he's a great player. I mean, if it weren't for the LIV Golf stuff with the world ranking points, I mean, he'd be right there near the top. Oh, he should be -- yeah, he should be there, but he made the right deal. They're all happy on LIV --

Travis Miller: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Well, they've -- they've got unlimited funding.

Travis Miller: They do.

Donald Trump: That I can tell you. Even the guys that want to play with a tour, they come to Saudi for the money, you know.

Travis Miller: They do. And they've definitely shaken stuff up for sure.

Donald Trump: And they've done some really great things. You know, like music. You never had music. Today, like 70 percent of the people, they're playing music on the course.

Travis Miller: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And once you get used to that, it's hard to play without it.

Travis Miller: Yeah.

Donald Trump: You know, It gives it a little life and excitement. They've done a lot of good things, and they're fantastic people.

Travis Miller: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And they're very happy. The LIV golfers are very, very happy.

Travis Miller: Yeah, well, it's fun to go to those events. We had a good time down at Doral --

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Travis Miller: During the tournament this last year and the team championship, so --

Donald Trump: And, you know, you had the Bryson win --

Travis Miller: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Recently, the US Open, with a great shot and a great putt.

Travis Miller: Yeah.

Donald Trump: People don't talk about the four-foot putt that he hit.

Travis Miller: Yeah, that would have been nerve wracking.

Donald Trump: That would have been -- he just walked up and hit it. Let me tell you, that was a -- that was a great shot, though.

Travis Miller: Yeah.

Donald Trump: I said if he makes that putt, which he will --

Travis Miller: Yeah.

Donald Trump: But if he makes that putt, that'll go down as one of the top five shots ever hit.

Travis Miller: Yeah.

Donald Trump: He have to. He won the US Open --

Travis Miller: Yeah.

Donald Trump: With a 60-yard sand shot. That's a hard shot.

Travis Miller: I think most people say that's the shot they fear the most, is those long sand shots.

Donald Trump: Well, that's the thing, they don't even practice them very much --

Travis Miller: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Because it's a very hard shot to figure, so --

Travis Miller: Yeah.

Donald Trump: But he hit a knuckle ball out of there, and that thing just was perfect.

Travis Miller: Yeah, ice in the veins, so --

Donald Trump: He does, he does. He does have that.

Travis Miller: So, you have quite a few hole-in-ones, what's that number at now?

Donald Trump: Eight.

Travis Miller: Eight.

Donald Trump: I have eight.

Travis Miller: That's -- most people go their whole life without making one, so it is impressive.

Donald Trump: Well, it's strange, yeah, but I've had people with more. They say Art Wall has 48 --

Travis Miller: Oh, my God.

Donald Trump: But they say Ben Hogan had none. Can you believe that?

Travis Miller: Yeah, that's --

Donald Trump: That's because he hit it so good, it just wouldn't stop. It didn't move. But they say he had none. I don't know. It's hard to believe, actually.

Travis Miller: Is there one of those eight that stand out to you as your favorite.

Donald Trump: Well, one, the last one I made was with Ernie Els --

Travis Miller: OK.

Donald Trump: And I had Gene Sauers and Ernie Els and Ken Duke and --

Travis Miller: That's good company to be in to do that.

Donald Trump: We had some really good golfers in the group. I think we were playing a fivesome actually and Ernie on the sixth hole. I had a par 5 that's a par 3.

Travis Miller: Yeah.

Donald Trump: That was 188 yards. There was a little wind in the face, a little bit. And I hit a 5-iron. And it took one bounce and one in the hole. And Ernie said, "Nice shot." He was my partner, it was we -- we had a good -- a good partnership going. And that was great. I mean, it was -- you know, you're playing with old tour players --

Travis Miller: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And you make a hole-in-one. That's pretty cool.

Travis Miller: That's pretty cool.

Donald Trump: And Ernie is so good. Gene Sauers won the US Open a few years ago --

Travis Miller: Yeah.

Donald Trump: You know, senior.

Travis Miller: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Ken Duke is --

Travis Miller: Great guy, too.

Donald Trump: Fantastic.

Travis Miller: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And we had -- we had another guy in that group who's a friend of mine, who's a fantastic player, too, a pro. And we had a good time. But that was one of the nice --

Travis Miller: Yeah.

Donald Trump: You know, it's nice to make a hole-in-one when you're playing with some guys where it matters, where they --

Travis Miller: Absolutely.

Donald Trump: Where they can actually say, "Oh, good shot," because they don't say it too often. And they said a lot of good shots.

Travis Miller: I've made one, and it was at West Palm.

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Travis Miller: I hosted a tournament there.

Donald Trump: Good.

Travis Miller: And it was a hole 4, I think. Is it 4?

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Travis Miller: Yeah. And it was on my birthday week, and I was hosting the tournament, and it went in, I didn't see it, but my caddie was up on the cooler and saw it go in and --

Donald Trump: Wow.

Travis Miller: I was in disbelief, but --

Donald Trump: So, what's your handicap?

Travis Miller: I'm 5.

Donald Trump: That's good.

Travis Miller: Yeah, so I'm getting there.

Donald Trump: Let me hit some shots, I got to play. So, do you want to do some more someplace else?

Travis Miller: Absolutely, yeah.

Donald Trump: OK.

Travis Miller: We'll talk a little bit more with the --

Donald Trump: Yeah, let's do a little bit.

Travis Miller: Absolutely.

Donald Trump: Thanks, fellas. All right, watch this. You wouldn't believe this. Look at that. Who would believe that? You think Joe Biden -- you think Joe Biden can do that?

Travis Miller: Oh, I don't think so.

Donald Trump: I don't think so. Joe, remember he challenged me?

Travis Miller: Well, that's what we were hoping for was the second debate would be a golf match and --

Donald Trump: Well, I said, I'll do it. I offered him $1 million. He said he's a 6.

Travis Miller: Yeah.

Donald Trump: I said you're not a 60, He's not a 60.

Travis Miller: Yeah.

Donald Trump: So, I said I'll give you $1 million if you can break a hundred. I said, "Here." Yeah. I said, "A million -- a million if you can break a hundred." Now, a 6 can break a hundred easy, right?

Travis Miller: You'd think so, right?

Donald Trump: But he can't.

Travis Miller: Do you remember the match with Stephen Ames and Tiger Woods?

Donald Trump: Oh, that was terrible.

Travis Miller: I think that's pretty much how it would go down, 10 and 8, Trump.

Donald Trump: That was not -- Stephen Ames was a good player. It was not --

Travis Miller: He was a good player, yeah.

Donald Trump: We got a little sassy, that's all. That was --

Travis Miller: Yeah, you talk to Tiger like that it's --

Donald Trump: Can't do it.

Travis Miller: He went in a different mode.

Donald Trump: That was a bad match. OK. Do you think they're impressed now? I don't have to show anymore, right?

Unidentified: [inaudible]

Donald Trump: How's this swing look? Pretty good?

Travis Miller: It looks good. You looked dialed.

Donald Trump: Pretty good, right?

Travis Miller: You looked dialed.

Donald Trump: Pretty good. People say --

Travis Miller: That's a handicap down to --

Donald Trump: Well, mostly --

Travis Miller: Your short game has tightened up a lot.

Donald Trump: Really, my short game is good. I mean it's so low -- honestly, I don't like saying because people wouldn't believe it because I'm at an age where I should be losing it. And I haven't. I've been able to play. I believe I'm a better player now than I was 25 years ago.

Travis Miller: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Isn't it crazy? You've heard that?

Travis Miller: That is crazy.

Donald Trump: And I mean, I just won the club championship at -- in Palm Beach --

Travis Miller: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Where we have 21 scratch players.

Travis Miller: Bunch of great players.

Donald Trump: I won the seniors, and I played so well in the seniors. I said, I might as well play in the regular. And I beat kids at -- that are, you know, very good players.

Travis Miller: Yeah.

Donald Trump: We have 21 scratch players, scratch or better. And I won. So, you know, you can't do that easily.

Travis Miller: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And a lot of people can't play in club championships. I know guys in club championships, they can't play. You play with them, they're scratch players. I say, "Are you going to play in the club championships?" "No, I'll be away." "What do you mean you'll be away?" "I'll be away, sir. I'm making a trip. I can't change it." Because they can't play.

Travis Miller: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Do you understand that?

Travis Miller: Pressure, yeah.

Donald Trump: The club championship is our major.

Travis Miller: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And they can't handle the pressure. He said, "I stand over a three-foot putt, I can't even see the hole."

Travis Miller: Yeah.

Donald Trump: The guy about himself. And I said, "That's too bad." But he -- but they're like scratch players, pretty close to scratch players.

Travis Miller: Yeah.

Donald Trump: I have one guy he's better than a scratch player, but he can't -- he can never even qualify.

Travis Miller: Yeah. We got Jack Nicklaus with 18 majors, you're at 30-plus club championships there.

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Travis Miller: So, you're right there on that level.

Donald Trump: Jack is great.

Travis Miller: He's amazing.

Donald Trump: Jack is great. Gary Player, Lee Trevino, those old guys. You know the pictures of the older guys from my clubhouses, they like it the best. Ben Hogan, they love Ben Hogan.

Travis Miller: Yeah.

Donald Trump: They love Sam Snead, the great Sam Snead.

Travis Miller: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Jack is fantastic. He was such a killer.

Travis Miller: Yeah.

Donald Trump: I mean he was just brutal.

Travis Miller: That was unbelievable.

Donald Trump: He would -- he would win. And you know, when the pressure goes, you see people choking coming down the line. He got better. You know, he's one of the few, you get better. Some of them -- Gary Player --

Travis Miller: Yeah.

Donald Trump: He won 168 tournaments. He won, I guess, 18 something, like nine and nine, right?

Travis Miller: That guy, Scott, unlimited energy still at his age today.

Donald Trump: That's unbelievable.

Travis Miller: It's unbelievable.

Donald Trump: So, I've been playing with him since he's 70. And now he's like 88.

Travis Miller: Yeah.

Donald Trump: I don't think I've ever seen him miss a shot.

Travis Miller: No, he's --

Donald Trump: Gary is unbelievable. Those guys are just great, and they're -- they're a lot of fun to be with.

Travis Miller: So, with all the trophies you've accumulated over the years, is there like a man cave at Mar-a-Lago where they're all on display?

Donald Trump: Well, my wife hates it when I come home because I come home with so many trophies, and she says, "Not another one." So, usually, I'm forced to take some out, and I put them around the clubhouses. But we have a lot of trophies, a lot of -- a lot of club championships and member guests. You know, you play, but that's not pressure.

Travis Miller: Yeah.

Donald Trump: A member guest isn't pressure. You know, you play with four or five people and a pro.

Travis Miller: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And there's no pressure there. You're all hitting a best ball. That's -- that's not what I mean. The club championships are pressure.

Travis Miller: Yeah.

Donald Trump: It's a whole -- I mean, I'm not talking about with strokes either. You know, you have some of these things where they have A flight, B flight. I don't even really do that with --

Travis Miller: Yeah.

Donald Trump: With my clubs because it doesn't mean anything. You got a guy who has too many strokes, and, you know, you can't do it. But the -- the club championship, the real club championship is big pressure for a lot of people. Really good golfers don't play in them because they don't want to be embarrassed.

Travis Miller: Yeah.

Donald Trump: You know, your name is up, and they don't want to, you know --

Travis Miller: They got --

Donald Trump: Ride along then you shot 91.

Travis Miller: They've got what I call a vanity handicap --

Donald Trump: Well --

Travis Miller: Sometimes [inaudible]

Donald Trump: They're -- they're the right -- I mean, I've played with many guys that are scratch, but they'll never win a club championship.

Travis Miller: Yeah.

Donald Trump: It's just funny. It's just -- it's like -- it's our major, and they can't play under that. And then, you have some that can. I have guys that aren't that good that do well in club championships. You know, it's a different --

Travis Miller: Yeah.

Donald Trump: It's a mentality, it's in -- right there --

Travis Miller: Yeah.

Donald Trump: That's a big part of golf, right?

Travis Miller: Yeah, between the ears.

Donald Trump: So, thank you very much. Good luck with your projects.

Travis Miller: Absolutely. Yeah, we've been -- we teamed up with sendthevote.com to get awareness leading up to the big day.

Donald Trump: Oh, that's good.

Travis Miller: So, I know the Nelk Boys are doing the same thing, too.

Donald Trump: Oh, they're great. I'll tell you that.

Travis Miller: I know you love those boys.

Donald Trump: Oh, they're great. Those guys are great. Well, good luck with that.

Travis Miller: Yeah, just trying to get people to register, pledge their vote.

Donald Trump: You look like you're better than a 5.

Travis Miller: I need to get there, so --
