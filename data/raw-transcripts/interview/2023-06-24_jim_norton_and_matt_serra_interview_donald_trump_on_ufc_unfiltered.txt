Jim Norton: Welcome to UFC Unfiltered. Matt and I, in typical fashion, are here in Las Vegas interviewing the 45th president of the United States, Donald Trump. Thank you, sir, for being here.

Donald Trump: Thank you very much. It's an honor and I've seen plenty of fights.

Matt Serra: Oh, please.

Donald Trump: Tough cookie, we're not going to mess around with.

Matt Serra: Oh, thank you so much. And I know that you're a genuine fight fan.

Donald Trump: I am, of course.

Matt Serra: My very first fight was in 2001 at the UFC -- I'm sorry, the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City.

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Matt Serra: I got knocked out by a spinning backfist. We're not going to bring that up. Is this thing rolling? No. OK. But back then in 2001, people weren't that excited to be attached to the UFC. And you were, which I'd like to know about how you learned about the UFC.

Donald Trump: So, somehow I got to know Dana.

Matt Serra: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And a whole group of people that were into it and really liking it. And I respected them, and I respected Dana a lot. And, you know, that family is a great family.

Matt Serra: Yes.

Donald Trump: That helped Dana out. OK. We don't have to mention names, but that family is fantastic. And they've been with me right from the beginning. Incredible people, smart people, too, and good people. And they couldn't get a venue because of the danger. You know, people thought it was so dangerous, and they happened to be right about that.

Donald Trump: But they couldn't get a venue. And I supplied them with a venue, and I think it was for a few of the fights, maybe even five early fights. And in those days, the danger was, you know, perceived as being -- look, there's great danger. But it was perceived as being just like death. And so, a lot of the athletic commissions wouldn't do it and owners wouldn't do it, and they couldn't get venues.

Donald Trump: And I gave them venues early on. And it's an incredible thing because both Dana and that great group of investors, particular our friends.

Matt Serra: Yes.

Donald Trump: They appreciated it. And Dana, to this day, I can say that I watched an interview a year ago where they went in and they were saying -- they were trying to get some bad stuff on Trump. And he said, "No, wait a minute, you're a smart guy." He said, "Wait a minute. I'll never say bad about Trump. You want me to say bad about Trump?

Donald Trump: I'm never saying bad about Trump. He helped me a lot when nobody else would." And you know, those early years for UFC were very tough.

Matt Serra: Yes.

Donald Trump: They were very tough. I got the inside scoop from a lot of people. They were close to closing it down a few times, and they kept it going. And --

Jim Norton: I think it was $2 million, I think. It was something like 2 million --

Donald Trump: Well, they were -- you know, they were losing money and it was it was a tough deal. And they pulled it through. And now, it's a phenomenal juggernaut. It's incredible what's happened. And, you know, I give tremendous respect for the initial group and for also for Dana. I don't think anybody could have done what Dana did.

Donald Trump: I really don't -- you know, usually they say everybody is replaceable no matter what, everybody's replaceable. I don't think this guy is replaceable. Now, you know, I hope I'm not hurting here their investment because, I don't know, where do you find somebody like this? The job he does, and he truly loves it. You know, when I talk to people about success, you have to love what you do. He truly loves it.

Jim Norton: And he also will tell the truth about a card. Like if he doesn't like a card, he'll come out and go, that fight sucked, it wasn't good. And I think people trust you when you come out and say something good about your product or something bad about it if you're not happy with it.

Donald Trump: Well, you heard the name matchmaker for years in boxing and other things, and he's a great matchmaker. He understands the fighters, he understands the good fight. And, you know, you can have a great fighter against a not very good fighter. And it's not very exciting usually. I mean, sometimes, you have an upset, but not that often.

Donald Trump: He's a great matchmaker. He understands it. But he loves it, and he's really good at what he does. And I get to watch as much as I can. It's, you know, highly competitive stuff. You know that better than --

Matt Serra: Yeah, like, even back then in 2001, you hosted it. But I knew you were a fan because the very next event, UFC 32, was at the Meadowlands, and you showed up as just a fan.

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Matt Serra: You were in -- yeah.

Donald Trump: Well, I did. And we had a really rough card. That first one was rough. In fact, I'm not even sure it was so rough, it was great. But I don't know if that helped him or not because anybody that saw that would say that is a dangerous world.

Matt Serra: Yeah.

Donald Trump: But it was incredible. And, yeah, I've gone to numerous fights, and I'll be going tonight. And tonight, you have a very good card.

Matt Serra: Yes.

Donald Trump: but I've been to some great UFC fights.

Jim Norton: Are you good at making picks? No matter how many fights I watch, I'm terrible at making picks. I'm always wrong.

Donald Trump: Well, this sport is interesting. Like I watched Usman. I think he's a terrific guy, by the way.

Matt Serra: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Terrific person. And I only say that because when people say nice about me, I say nice about them. But he is. He's a terrific and a fantastic fighter. And I watched that fight, and he was essentially undefeated and pretty much unbeatable. And he goes into the fight, and he was winning that fight by so much.

Jim Norton: Yeah.

Donald Trump: It was over. And then, the one kick and it was indeed over. [Inaudible] so, you never really know. You never really know. And I was a little surprised. And I give credit to his opponent because in the next fight, he was, you know, pretty fairly dominant.

Jim Norton: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And I was a little surprised to see that. But Usman is a great fighter. And then, all of a sudden, that ended. So, it was -- it's you never know what's going to happen. And if you look at the kicks and the punches, right, the kicks and the punches.

Jim Norton: Matt pointed this out, too. In his corner, Leon was losing that fight badly.

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Jim Norton: And his corner said, "Stop feeling sorry for yourself." Like his corner woke him up, and he came back and he knocked out Usman in the fifth round. It's one of the most amazing comebacks.

Donald Trump: I've never seen -- and it was really close to the end. It was almost.

Jim Norton: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And I sort of -- it was not an exciting fight but a very dominant fight --

Jim Norton: Yes.

Donald Trump: Because Usman was dominating with the grappling or the wrestling, just dominating. And the last round, he decided to just sort of take it a little bit easy and box, and that didn't work out too well.

Matt Serra: No, it's such a game of inches.

Donald Trump: Yeah it is.

Matt Serra: You zig when you should have zagged.

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Matt Serra: The fight's over. I think that's one of the main differences between that and boxing, obviously. Boxing, you got the right and the left, you know. This one, you got the right, the left, also the right, left elbow, the knees, the submissions, the takedowns. Do you prefer one or the other with the combat sports, the boxing or the MMA?

Donald Trump: I always like boxing. I've held a lot of fights.

Matt Serra: Yeah.

Donald Trump: I held a lot of Mike Tyson fights, and he was a fierce guy. And I think even mentally in a sense, a lot of people were they looked like they were defeated. Big guys, they were bigger than him in many cases, and they were defeated. I held the Tyson-Spinks fight.

Jim Norton: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And that landed lasted 92 seconds.

Matt Serra: Yes.

Donald Trump: And people were coming from all over the world to watch it. And it was a big deal. You know, Spinks was undefeated and a really good fighter, but he was sort of a light heavyweight. But he won his light heavyweight fights, but he won all his heavyweight fights, and he had never been knocked down. And you could see he was not thrilled about that fight.

Jim Norton: He looked scared going into it.

Donald Trump: Yeah, a little bit.

Jim Norton: He looked a little scared.

Donald Trump: But people came from Europe. They came from all over the world to watch it, and they're being seated, and the fight was over. I had a little hard time because I had a lot of pretty unhappy people. But that was exciting. And we had so many, so many great fights. Larry Holmes was a great fighter. I thought he never got that much credit.

Jim Norton: Can I ask you about that? Because Larry Holmes, 48-0, and then Spinks beat him. Was it because he followed Ali? Why do you think he never got the respect and love that he should have gotten?

Donald Trump: It was really an incredible because he followed Ali. At the same time, he fought Ali. And I think that was the worst beating that Ali ever took. He didn't get knocked out. I guess they threw in -- his head was twice the size. I think if there was a problem caused by boxing, that might have been it. That was the worst -- and Larry Holmes was screaming to stop the fight.

Donald Trump: He was actually screaming --

Jim Norton: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Because he admired Ali. But following Ali, that was a tremendous punishment, if you remember that --

Jim Norton: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Because Larry Holmes had the best left jab. But if you take a look at Ali, there was something so magic. And following him was, I think, probably very hard for anybody to do. Larry Holmes is a, you know, great champion. But following Ali was very hard to do.

Jim Norton: And you got to know Ali. I know you knew him pretty well.

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Jim Norton: And you've credited Frazier-Ali with kind of getting you interested in boxing. What was it about that fight that kind of got you on that?

Donald Trump: Well, I knew him all. I mean, I really knew him all. Ali was great, and Joe Frazier was great.

Jim Norton: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And it just, uh, sort of like different folks because Joe Frazier was so bad for George Foreman. But Ali was so good for George Foreman, right? You know, that was one of the greatest fights, because everybody thought George Foreman was invincible at the time. And he did the rope-a-dope stuff.

Matt Serra: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And everybody thought it was over, and -- but he saw something, you know, he saw the stamina thing. Ali saw that. And he was a genius at fighting.

Jim Norton: Yeah.

Donald Trump: He was a genius. But he had a hard time with Frazier. He had a hard time with Kenny Norton, right? He had a hard time with Kenny Norton.

Jim Norton: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And yet, Kenny Norton had a hard time with other people.

Jim Norton: Yeah.

Donald Trump: So, you never know really how it goes. Joe Frazier was an incredible fighter.

Jim Norton: Did you think he got a fair rap, too? I don't think Joe Frazier got a fair rap. People loved Ali and they hated Frazier. And Frazier was a really good guy.

Donald Trump: He was a great guy, and he was a great fighter. And their fights were among the best you'll ever see.

Jim Norton: Oh, yeah.

Donald Trump: I was talking the other day, Tommy "The Hitman" Hearns, right?

Matt Serra: Yes.

Donald Trump: Against Marvin Hagler.

Matt Serra: Marvin Hagler. Yes.

Donald Trump: So, that was less than four rounds. I said -- they said, "What's the greatest fight you've ever seen?" I said, "Well, one of them only lasted three rounds." So, you can't have a great fight for three rounds. But I thought that was among the greatest three rounds ever, right.

Matt Serra: Yeah, throwing caution to the wind.

Donald Trump: Well, he almost knocked Hagler out --

Matt Serra: Oh yeah.

Donald Trump: In the first round. And then, in the third round, you know you could see it. But that was -- people watched that, and that's one of the greatest fights.

Matt Serra: Speaking of Marvelous Marvin Hagler, his fight versus Sugar Ray Leonard.

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Matt Serra: What's your thoughts on that?

Donald Trump: Well, hey, Sugar Ray is another one. I'll tell you, I thought you're going to ask a different one. His fight on Roberto Duran.

Jim Norton: Oh.

Donald Trump: So Roberto Duran was incredible.

Matt Serra: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And beat him badly up in Canada. I was at that fight.

Jim Norton: You were.

Donald Trump: And then, if you remember, Sugar Ray came back.

Matt Serra: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And he beat him on the No Mas, No Mas fight, right Sugar Ray was great. Look, you have a lot of great champions. It's hard to say. Some people say, "Who's the best? Who's the greatest?" I don't know if you can really say it, but Sugar Ray was great. Hagler was great. Hagler was so great. Tommy "The Hitman" Hearns was good.

Jim Norton: Were you happy to see Roberto Duran? He was in the cage with Masvidal after that fight with Nate Diaz.

Donald Trump: Yeah, well, Jorge Masvidal was -- you know why I love him? I love people that like me. He likes me. And, you know, he's a guy from Cuba --

Matt Serra: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Who got left alone in life at, like, 9-years-old and, you know, really went through a lot. And he had the quickest knockout. And I remember Dana saying, "Oh, the young man that he's fighting is really good. He's really good. But he got knocked out in like three seconds or something."

Matt Serra: Ben Askren. Ben Askren is a --

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Matt Serra: World-class wrestler.

Donald Trump: Right.

Matt Serra: So, everybody thought -- and he was -- he did so well overseas. So, everybody thought that he was going to have his way with Jorge Masvidal. And then a flying knee later --

Jim Norton: Yeah.

Donald Trump: So, what happened to Ben after that fight?

Matt Serra: You know what, I believe he fought Demian Maia, who was a jiu-jitsu expert --

Donald Trump: Right.

Matt Serra: Which was a very fun match because that was basically like jiu-jitsu versus wrestling. He ended up getting strangled. He didn't have the best showing in the UFC, Ben Askren.

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Jim Norton: He did well against Lawler. Lawler was beating him, and he wound up beating Lawler in his first fight, yeah.

Matt Serra: He ended up beating Lawler.

Matt Serra: And then after that he had the fight with Jorge Masvidal.

Jim Norton: Yeah.

Matt Serra: And then, it was downhill after that.

Donald Trump: But Jorge is a great guy, and he was campaigning for me. You know, he said --

Jim Norton: Yeah

Donald Trump: Somehow, I'm making a speech and there's thousands of people. And I look and I say, I think that guy is a fighter. And then, I saw it was Jorge, and he had done some good stuff. You know, he had a -- I don't know if he's retired or not retired, but he had a hell of a career when you think of it.

Matt Serra: They said he just --

Jim Norton: He just retired.

Donald Trump: I think he might have retired. But he was a big fan of mine politically. And I'll tell you, it had a difference. I did phenomenally well in Miami and in all of Florida with the Hispanic population, and I credit a lot of that to Jorge. So, we love Jorge. And he's a tough cookie. He's a tough cookie. And they had a fight with Colby, who I really like, too.

Donald Trump: You know Colby, those two don't like each other.

Matt Serra: That's a good one for you.

Donald Trump: But Colby is a MAGA guy. He's -- he walks into the ring sometimes wearing a Make America Great Again.

Jim Norton: Yup.

Donald Trump: And he's got a great fight coming up. I think his fight coming up is going to be fantastic.

Jim Norton: Yeah, he's fighting Leon, I think.

Matt Serra: He's fighting for the title --

Jim Norton: The belt, yeah.

Matt Serra: With Leon Edwards.

Jim Norton: No. Is it hard when two guys you like so much are kind of fighting with each other? Because everybody asks you to weigh in and, you know, who would you pick.

Donald Trump: I don't love it. Yeah, I don't love it. I hate to give that kind of an answer.

Jim Norton: Sure.

Donald Trump: Like, you know, I don't like to do that. But I've had a couple where -- because I know so many of the fighters. I've held a lot of fights for --

Matt Serra: Yeah.

Donald Trump: For my own reasons. I mean, we have -- it brings people, it brings success, it brings money, it brings a lot of good things, and it's an interesting business. I think you've heard -- I think UFC has hurt boxing a lot.

Jim Norton: Yeah.

Donald Trump: But when you have a big boxing match, it still does great, a big one.

Matt Serra: They could co-exist.

Donald Trump: But the media matches, the smaller matches, I don't think they're very exciting anymore. I don't think they do very well anymore. But I notice, when there is a good match, when you have a big match and a good match, they do pretty well.

Jim Norton: It seems like Dana, too, the UFC has been so good about getting you the fight you want to see as a fan.

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Jim Norton: Whereas what do you think it is that's slowed boxing down where they'll make you wait years to get a match up and Dana will put it together in six months?

Donald Trump: Dana, look, there's nobody like this guy. I know him. All I know -- forget about fighting. I know him all in business. Dana White is an incredible person, and he's a loyal person. He's a very loyal person, but he understands it. He loves it. And you're right. You know, you hear so much about, like, a boxing match where they're going to meet.

Donald Trump: They're going to meet six years later, they haven't. Then, by the time they meet the one guy they say is over the hill and it no longer means anything, Dana, if -- when you have those situations, it always happens. I think Khabib was great, and it looks like --

Matt Serra: Yeah.

Donald Trump: He probably doesn't come back. But I asked Dana last night, when is Khabib -- are you going to get him to come back?

Matt Serra: He tried.

Jim Norton: He tried.

Donald Trump: So but I thought he was -- he was a seriously good fighter, right?

Jim Norton: I thin he promised his mom or something that he wouldn't fight anymore. There was some type of a --

Donald Trump: When his father died --

Jim Norton: Yes.

Matt Serra: Yes.

Donald Trump: He had something -- but I thought he was a fantastic fighter.

Jim Norton: And when you put together Spinks and Tyson, was that kind of like to break Vegas back in a way? Like, wasn't that the first big win for Atlantic City?

Donald Trump: Well, I had a lot of Mike Tyson fights. I had more Tyson fights than anybody else, and I got along great with him. In fact, I saw him recently and he could not have been nicer.

Jim Norton: Yeah.

Donald Trump: You know, he was always very nice to me and very good, but I had a lot of fights. And he was a draw. He could draw anything. And he had a great career. And then, I was at the fight in Japan, which was sort of a -- I was sitting next to Don King, and I was a little bit surprised because Mike was expected to win that.

Donald Trump: And he was fighting a good fighter, but somebody that wasn't always in shape, and he put himself into great shape. And his left jab was like a Larry Holmes left jab. You remember that?

Matt Serra: Buster Douglas was in amazing shape that day

Donald Trump: After two rounds, I looked at Don King. I said, listen, "Don, we're watching -- is this right? Because, you know, nobody thought that. And it was a weird scene because it was at seven in the morning.

Matt Serra: Yeah.

Jim Norton: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Because it was in Japan. So, it was broadcast. It's a huge time difference. It's broadcast in the evening here.

Matt Serra: Yeah.

Donald Trump: So, I'm watching a fight at seven in the morning. And the people were just sort of clapping very politely. It wasn't like a fight crowd, but that was a strange fight. But Mike was a, you know, incredible, just an incredible draw. And really, he's really -- when you know him, he's really a good guy.

Jim Norton: What do you think it is about Tyson, too? Because people love him in a way. Like there's so many great fighters like Lennox, Lewis, Holyfield, Holmes. What is it about Mike that still resonates with people? Because they really love Mike Tyson.

Donald Trump: So, he started so strong and he was like invincible. And he went that way for a long time. I mean, you know, eventually, you're going to lose a fight. It just happens to be like Usman. You know, Usman didn't look like he was going to lose at all. And then, he's at a fight where he's so dominant. I mean, frankly, it was a boring fight.

Donald Trump: And then, he decided to change styles a little bit, which I guess probably, if he'll look back, he'll say --

Matt Serra: Yeah.

Donald Trump: We should have grappled for one more round.

Matt Serra: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And he wouldn't have had that problem. But Mike was a very dominant force and a very. I mean, he had the whole thing with Robin, and the whole thing with this and that. It was always -- and ultimately it built a very big character. And, you know, he did a Broadway play.

Matt Serra: Yes.

Donald Trump: And nobody understands this when I say it, he was great in it.

Jim Norton: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And I went as a favor really to him. I went to the Broadway play. It was an opening, and it was actually a great show. And I told him a couple of months ago I was with him. I said, "You ought to do another one or do it in Vegas or something." But Mike Tyson did sort of a one-man show.

Jim Norton: Yeah.

Matt Serra: I remember that.

Donald Trump: And it was actually really good. And I just -- you know, I have to speak highly about him because he was a great fighter.

Jim Norton: Yeah.

Donald Trump: But I guess you reach a certain level, a certain age, and it doesn't work quite as well. But you can come back. You know, it's interesting when they say the great ones and especially the ones with the big punch, like George Foreman. So, George Foreman, who's a terrific guy, but boy, is he different than he was because he was a very sullen guy.

Jim Norton: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And then he turned out to be a big personality. But he fought a young fighter who was very good, considered very good. And George was getting beaten up for six or seven rounds pretty badly.

Jim Norton: Michael Moorer.

Donald Trump: Michael Moorer was the fighter.

Matt Serra: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And then he fought Michael Moorer. And it was not even -- I mean, George was taking tremendous punishment. This guy was dancing around. And then, George hit him. It was actually a double hit.

Jim Norton: Yeah.

Donald Trump: It was a boom-boom. And man that was over.

Jim Norton: He didn't even move when he threw the punch. It was like a really -- it was like the 10th round, and Foreman was just kind of standing there, and he just threw it.

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Jim Norton: You see how strong he was to drop him with just kind of a half punch.

Donald Trump: But he was just getting beaten up.

Matt Serra: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And, you know, it was an age thing. He wasn't moving fast. But they say when you have the punch, you never really lose the punch. Maybe you do it a certain age.

Jim Norton: Yeah.

Donald Trump: But you don't lose it for a long time. But that was an amazing event.

Jim Norton: Yeah.

Donald Trump: But the UFC has taken so much of the glamor. I think if Dana went into the world of boxing, which he might do, but if he ever did that, he'd probably bring it back, because it's also very good. What surprises me, if you look at the casualties and I mean literally casualties, boxing has many more.

Jim Norton: Yeah.

Donald Trump: I don't know if UFC has ever had a death, but boxing has had numerous.

Jim Norton: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And you would say that it would be the opposite, but it's not the opposite. And I think somebody said it's the shots to the head. Everything's -- but you would -- you know, it's always been a surprising statistic to me because, to me, UFC is more dangerous. It's certainly more dangerous looking. But you're spending a lot of time wrestling, and you're spending a lot of time --

Matt Serra: You know, I think that's if I'm personally if I'm in there, and I'm getting tuned up a little bit, at least I have the -- I don't -- if it's just boxing, you know, what are you going to do, quit?

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Matt Serra: You can't quit.

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Matt Serra: That's a No Mas. That's still -- you know, but you could look to change it up by initiating a takedown or switching up some strategies, which you couldn't do in a striking.

Donald Trump: Yeah. It's just a surprising stat to me. I've seen it --

Matt Serra: Because it's so blunt, I think, because, you know, it's very -- it looks more violent because of the blood and the cuts, and this and that, because of the skin on skin. But I think it's just your brain getting jarred around with the boxing.

Donald Trump: It's very surprising. But it's -- look, there's not this is not a safe sport that you guys are in. But it's safer than boxing, which is shocking.

Jim Norton: Yeah. Well, you see, you guys, I don't train. I mean, I know it's tough.

Donald Trump: It's very tough.

Jim Norton: Thank you. Foreman, by the way, the amazing thing about him, too, you talk about, like, Robbie Lawler's fighting his last fight tonight --

Donald Trump: Right.

Jim Norton: Fighting Niko Price. He's 41. Isn't it crazy that when Ali lost to Holmes, he was 38, and he looked like he was very old?

Donald Trump: Right.

Jim Norton: And then Foreman comes in at 38 and starts his career over again.

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Jim Norton: Forty-five when he wins the title. It's kind of amazing to watch older guys do what these guys have done.

Donald Trump: Yeah, and you're seeing it. They're doing better. Tom Brady, If you look at Tom Brady came in at a certain age, and everyone said, "Well, that's not going to work." You're seeing in your sport a lot where fighters are older, and they're doing very well. You know, I think a lot of it has to do with incentive.

Donald Trump: This doesn't seem to be a reason that somebody 36, 37, 38 wouldn't be able to do well, but a lot of them say they just can't -- they don't -- mentally, more than physically, they just don't want to work out like they used to when they were 24-years-old.

Jim Norton: Right.

Donald Trump: And they're looking to, you know, take on the world. So, I don't know, that seems to be a reason. But it seems that athletes are lasting for a longer period of time, which always made sense to me. It always made sense.

Matt Serra: I think the fight itself wouldn't -- is not the hardest thing, which sounds odd. I think as myself, as I get older, the training camps, getting through those training camps kind of --

Donald Trump: And that's what they say. As you get older, it's not that you can't do it. I think you're physically the same. Maybe in some ways you're stronger and better, but you don't have that same motivation to do it. You know, you've become successful. In your case, you become successful. And now, it's 10 years later, 15 years later, you just don't want to do that anymore.

Matt Serra: Exactly.

Donald Trump: You want the success, but you don't want to work quite as hard. But I think a lot of people now are lasting a lot longer. The Jets have a quarterback right now. It'll be very interesting. I think he'll do well.

Jim Norton: Oh, Aaron Rodgers, right?

Donald Trump: Aaron Rodgers, yeah, it's going to be very interesting to see how he does I think he'll do well. He's a great guy. But --

Jim Norton: Sports medicine I think, too, plays a big role, right?

Donald Trump: I think so. Well, even fixing the bones, you know, things that where you were out for your life, now, they fix them fairly routinely.

Jim Norton: Yeah.

Donald Trump: What's happened in -- in what you take now, some people take a lot of bad stuff. But what they do in terms of fixing broken bones and broken joints, it's incredible, the difference. Tommy John surgery is an example. I mean, I've seen people where the pitchers actually got better after Tommy. They were actually better.

Donald Trump: This is the only surgery I've ever seen where you get better.

Jim Norton: Yeah.

Donald Trump: But in some cases, the pitcher becomes better.

Matt Serra: Now, let me ask you, because I heard you're really into music. This is what I heard.

Donald Trump: I like music.

Matt Serra: That's the rumor. Now, if you were to fight, let's say in a different universe, you were to fight, what song would you come out to? What song would pump you up to go fight in the cage?

Donald Trump: I think that, well, "We are the Champions." But that's played so much.

Matt Serra: Yeah.

Donald Trump: I mean, every time you see a World Series or anything, they play it. But it's good. But there are a lot of songs. I mean inspirational songs, songs that make you want to do it.

Jim Norton: Didn't Tyson just come out to it like a -- wouldn't he have a weird like a sound? It wasn't even a song.

Donald Trump: Yeah. He came out -- but he came out and it was exciting. I don't know if you ever saw -- Vince McMahon is another one. He's fantastic. He's a fantastic guy, and one of the best ever.

Jim Norton: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And he would have the Undertaker and he had a song for The Undertaker. Now, this was an inspiring [Inaudible] but it was one of the greatest entries into a ring ever when The Undertaker comes in to a ring. I did a I did a fight with Vince, the battle of the billionaires. It's still supposedly the No. 1 ranked pay per view fight that they've ever had, which makes me feel happy.

Matt Serra: Was that fun?

Donald Trump: And -- but just before me was The undertaker fighting somebody, and it was incredible, the song. I said, "Vince, how are we going to beat this? This is not good to follow that fight." But Vince is another one. He's done a great job.

Jim Norton: It's amazing how many MMA fighters love WWE, too.

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Jim Norton: A lot of guys like Randleman over there, Cain Velasquez, like --

Donald Trump: Right.

Jim Norton: They -- Cormier loves it. Like, there's just something about the showmanship of WWE that even UFC guys --

Donald Trump: Well, Cormier is another fighter. I mean, you look at him, he's a -- he was he was a great fighter, and he was shorter.

Jim Norton: Yeah.

Donald Trump: But he had a tremendous heart and he had tremendous strength, right. But he was a -- he's a terrific -- he's a terrific guy, but he's a terrific fighter.

Jim Norton: Double champ, too, light heavyweight.

Donald Trump: Yeah. He was tough. You knew you were in a fight. You know, a fighter that I found was incredible was Evander "The Real Deal" Holyfield, right? And I watched him because he was really a light heavyweight. And the most he ever weighed was like 218. And he's fighting guys 260. And the one thing I'd always tell everybody, no matter what, no matter how big they were, they were in for a hell of a fight.

Matt Serra: Yeah.

Donald Trump: But he was he was really a great fighter.

Matt Serra: Yeah, you had that -- I was going to say his fights with Riddick Bowe were classic.

Donald Trump: The Riddick Bowe fights, I mean, they were unbelievable. So, one of the greatest rounds in history was the 12th round. Evander was, you would think, knocked out. Most guys would have stopped it.

Jim Norton: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And, you know, he really didn't get knocked out. But he was just -- it looked like he was dead on the ropes. By the end of the round, it looked like Riddick was dead. There was one of the I think it was the 12th round, but you have to take a look at that. That was like -- so, maybe it was the 10th round.

Donald Trump: But you have to look at that. That was an incredible fight. But he was a great fighter.

Jim Norton: Didn't -- was it in AC where they had to -- wasn't Foreman's last fight with Shannon Briggs, wasn't that in Atlantic City?

Donald Trump: Yes, I believe it was.

Jim Norton: Yeah. They booed the decision, I think --

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Jim Norton: I think Foreman won that fight, and everybody felt that he kind of got robbed.

Donald Trump: Yeah, I don't know. I think you're right about that. I think it was a bad decision.

Jim Norton: Do you think bad judging has hurt boxing? Like you get that in all combat sports. But when you look, it's like I saw you at a Golovkin fight. I sat behind you at a Golovkin fight. And then you see him and Alvarez fight and some of the judging. And it's like it makes me not want to watch boxing anymore.

Donald Trump: Well, is that Triple G you're talking about?

Jim Norton: Yes.

Donald Trump: So, I watched him. It was very interesting. I was at Mar-a-Lago, where you have very elegant people and people that aren't into the muscles.

Jim Norton: OK.

Donald Trump: And people that you'll never see fighting. I can tell you physically, they fight mentally. But I was there. And beautiful people are having dinner. And I looked and there was this guy who was Triple G. I didn't know him. I never heard of him. But I looked at him. I said, "I bet he's a fighter." You know, you could look -- if I look at you, I say, "I bet he's a fighter." But I looked at him and he came up to me, and he said yeah, "My name is Golovkin, Triple G." He said, "I'm fighting at Madison Square Garden." So, I -- and it was sort of he was a young version, and he was great.

Jim Norton: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And then, and he was so much better than anybody else. And then, I watched him as he became a champ. I guess he became champion, right? But they had a couple of fights with him. It doesn't matter who. I don't want to say who, he got screwed.

Matt Serra: Yeah.

Donald Trump: He dominated --

Jim Norton: Yeah.

Donald Trump: He dominated a certain fight, and they didn't give him the decision. And that takes your heart out.

Matt Serra: Yeah.

Donald Trump: You know, that really -- I think it took his heart out. But he was a great -- that guy was a great fighter.

Jim Norton: And it makes it hard as a fan to watch it, too, because if you like, I have no faith in the decision-making. It makes you not want to watch.

Donald Trump: You know, the decision making in UFC, I never thought about it, it's rare that you really disagree with a decision. It's very rare -- in boxing, you would see -- I've seen some fights that were so bad where a guy was pummeled for whatever number of rounds. Now, boxing was better when they had 15 rounds, to be honest with you.

Donald Trump: You know, those last three rounds. But that's easy for me to say. I don't have to go in there and, you know, do that. But it was better. Those three rounds. Sometimes, they call them -- the real -- those were the real champion rounds. But they changed it to 12. I actually think that hurt boxing.

Matt Serra: Why did they do that? To make it safer?

Donald Trump: Safer.

Jim Norton: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And they said a lot of damage was done in those last three rounds. But boxing was better. I mean, if they brought back 15-round championship fights, I think it would be, you know, helpful to boxing. But there must be a safety reason they did it. I don't know what the reason was, but I think it was safety.

Jim Norton: Yeah, I think guys were taking damage. And do you remember the fight Meldrick Taylor against Julio Cesar Chavez? Chavez was undefeated, and I think it was Richard Steele stopped it with maybe 10 seconds left --

Donald Trump: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Jim Norton: In the final round and gave it to Chavez.

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Jim Norton: Maybe that was just a coincidence. But you look at that, you're like, it's kind of hard to get back on board with boxing.

Donald Trump: It takes you hard out. I mean, it does that. But that's life, right?

Matt Serra: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Life can be that. You know, I look at like UFC or boxing or any of these things, even sports generally, it's sort of a microcosm of life. But it's quicker. It doesn't take years to determine. You know, it's over in 12 rounds, or it's over in five rounds or three rounds.

Matt Serra: Yes.

Jim Norton: Yeah.

Donald Trump: But it's really a microcosm of life. And you see it right in front of you. You have a great champion go in, he gets his ass kicked. You have another guy who's no good, and he has a great night. You know, it's so interesting. But the nice part, it's over in a period of a half an hour or 45 minutes.

Matt Serra: Yes.

Donald Trump: It's all over and you sort of see a decision. But it's a little bit like life when you think about it.

Matt Serra: Jimmy, I was going to say tonight, speaking of great fighters, Alexander Volkanovski.

Donald Trump: Yeah, he's a great fighter.

Matt Serra: Yeah, an amazing fighter --

Jim Norton: Yair Rodriguez?

Matt Serra: Yair Rodriguez, who's a very dynamic fighter, any thoughts on that fight? That's going to be exciting.

Donald Trump: Well, Rodriguez from Mexico --

Matt Serra: Yes.

Donald Trump: Said such nice things about me --

Matt Serra: Yeah.

Donald Trump: That I would never say anything bad.

Matt Serra: It's hard to, right? When they like you, it's hard --

Donald Trump: No, no, he's great. Now, at the same time, Alexander is tough although he lost the fight previous. But --

Matt Serra: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Lot of people think he didn't lose that fight.

Matt Serra: Very close, yeah.

Donald Trump: There are a lot of people, talking about UFC now because I'm just saying how good UFC is, but there were a lot of people thought that he did not lose that fight. How do you feel about that, Matt?

Matt Serra: The Volkanovski fight with --

Donald Trump: Yeah, yeah.

Matt Serra: Makhachev --

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Matt Serra: Islam? I thought the way it ended, if they scored it like they did in Pride, like as a whole fight --

Donald Trump: Right.

Matt Serra: It ended with him having -- he had the bigger moments, I'd say. He had the bigger moments in the fight.

Donald Trump: So could that have gone either way?

Matt Serra: It could have.

Donald Trump: So, who did you think won?

Matt Serra: I thought Islam won.

Donald Trump: OK.

Matt Serra: I thought it was a just decision because he dominated more of the rounds. If you go round the round, he had more time clocked in just controlling it.

Donald Trump: That wasn't a bad decision. But that is a decision could have been -- you know, Alexander did very well.

Matt Serra: If it went the other way, it would --

Donald Trump: But I've seen fights where it's --

Matt Serra: Oh, yeah.

Donald Trump: And these are boxing matches where it's horrible, honestly.

Matt Serra: Yeah.

Donald Trump: It's horrible.

Jim Norton: You're like something has to be --

Donald Trump: And that hurt -- that hurt the sport.

Jim Norton: It hurt it a lot I think, yeah. And it also you invest more in these -- Dana is so good, like you said, at building these undercards and building the lesser-than-the-giant fights. They're fights that people are invested in as well.

Donald Trump: Well, I knew Don King very well, OK? When you knew Don King, you really knew somebody, and he was great. And I have a lot of respect for Bob Arum. I mean, look, he's still doing it. He's doing great. He's been doing it for 250 years, I think since the founding. And he's still doing it great. You know, he's at the top of his game.

Matt Serra: Yeah.

Donald Trump: But I knew Don King and I always used to say signing a contract with Don didn't mean much because you'd sign, and then an hour before the fight, he'd come to you and say, "My fighter's not feeling well. He's not going to make it." You have a full house.

Jim Norton: Yeah.

Donald Trump: You say, "What are you telling us, Don?"

Jim Norton: Yeah.

Donald Trump: He said, well, he needs a little more money. I mean, this is -- but I knew him very well. And a true piece of work.

Jim Norton: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Not to be imitated, but I liked him. I liked him. But sometimes, a deal wasn't so secure when you --

Jim Norton: Yes.

Donald Trump: Whether it was in writing or not.

Jim Norton: It's more of a suggestion.

Donald Trump: But Don King was an amazing guy. He couldn't be -- he couldn't be imitated.

Jim Norton: Would you -- did you ever have to back off on that at the end? Like, was there ever a moment you're like, "All right, I'll do it." Or were you able usually to push back?

Donald Trump: I refuse to say, but the answer is we got the fight on.

Jim Norton: The fight happened.

Donald Trump: But, no, Don was -- he was tough. He was -- look, there was probably nobody ever like him, right? I saw him take over from the original two guys. You remember? I saw him take over Mike and took over Mike Tyson.

Jim Norton: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And I watched it happen. And there was nobody better at that stuff than Don King. What he could do was magic. And he was, you know, just a big personality. They imitated him. They had somebody trying to imitate Don King in the last Rocky fight. And those Rocky fights were great. And they had -- the fighters, they had everybody, but they had a person that was actually an imitation of Don King.

Donald Trump: But the size wasn't right, the face wasn't right, the hair wasn't right, it was not a good imitation. Because you can't really -- you can't really imitate a guy like that.

Jim Norton: Because he's not menacing, Don King. Don King smiles, like he's a very charismatic guy.

Donald Trump: He'll grab people at Mar-a-Lago. He'll walk into a party, he'll grab two beautiful people and he'll scream, "Only in America." And he gets away with it, right?

Jim Norton: He does get away with it. He said it to me, and I was like, "Yeah, you're absolutely right, Don." I wasn't going to argue with him.

Donald Trump: He was good -- a very good guy.

Jim Norton: Is it the ability to say this is going to happen like he did with in Zaire with Ali and Foreman? Is it the ability just to say, "I'm going to make this happen," and not be afraid that it doesn't happen that makes him so great?

Donald Trump: Well, it is. But, you know, if you look at that fight, that was an incredible fight because that was when Foreman was invincible. He was knocking out everybody in the first round, and Ali was going over to Africa to fight.

Jim Norton: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And that was one of the most genius fights ever, because all Ali did was this. And he just kept the arms up and --

Jim Norton: Yeah.

Donald Trump: They wanted to throw in the towel. Ali knew exactly what he was doing. That was one of the greatest fights. That was a genius fight. Remember, they want to throw in the towel.

Jim Norton: Yeah.

Donald Trump: No, no. His arms were twice the size. It was so swollen.

Jim Norton: Yeah.

Donald Trump: But -- and then all of a sudden, it happened where left or right or left or right. And that fight was over. That was a genius fight.

Jim Norton: Yeah.

Matt Serra: It was.

Donald Trump: In terms of strategy.

Jim Norton: Rope-a-dope, yeah.

Matt Serra: Rope-a-dope wasn't a thing before that.

Jim Norton: Right.

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Matt Serra: And it is wild you said with George Foreman. He used to be a quiet guy looking, frightening German --

Donald Trump: Sullen.

Matt Serra: Yah, German shepherds. And then, years later, when he came back, talk about personality, George Foreman grills and this and that.

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Matt Serra: Where did that come from?

Donald Trump: Oh, he's a great guy. And he's got a great -- I don't know, it was -- I don't know what it was. But in the initial, he was a very -- the word is sullen, right?

Matt Serra: Yeah, I believe so, yeah.

Donald Trump: Nobody really liked him. He was unbelievable because he was knocking everybody out. And, you know, he only started fighting like a year before --

Jim Norton: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Which tells you that talent is more important than work.

Jim Norton: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Work is very important. But talent, you know, that was an extreme talent. But he only was boxing a very short period of time before the Olympics. And then, he ends up winning the Olympics pretty easily, right?

Jim Norton: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And then he ends up having a great career. But he didn't box, you know, from for very much more than a year or two before he won the Olympics. But he was very talented. And, you know, he was born with the big punch, right? Probably nobody had a bigger punch than George Foreman.

Jim Norton: And his persona. He was such a terrifying guy.

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Jim Norton: And he said he admitted that he was scared of Joe Frazier. He said he was shaking before that fight, and that's why he pummeled him so mad. Because he was frightened.

Donald Trump: But he was meant for Joe Frazier. When Joe Frazier would charge him and he hit him with the uppercut, remember that was the weirdest because it took like three seconds. And then Joe went up in the air. It was almost like a like a spring.

Jim Norton: Yeah.

Donald Trump: He hit him and then Joe went up. It showed great bravery in Joe, but he was not meant for -- you know, Joe was not meant to fight him.

Matt Serra: It's wild. I heard in an interview that George Foreman said if he was younger and this was sport, was around mixed martial arts, he would like to try his hand, which would have been funny with him in those with those little gloves punching. Not funny but --

Donald Trump: I mean the truth is you never know. Like, you know, you have somebody fighting Bo Nickal tonight.

Jim Norton: Oh, yeah.

Matt Serra: Oh, yes.

Donald Trump: So, he was at the White House, and he was with Jim Jordan. Jim Jordan -- you know, Jim Jordan, the congressman, was a great wrestler. He was an all-American wrestler. I guess he was the NCAA champion --

Matt Serra: OK.

Donald Trump: For a number of times, but a great wrestler. But he was an all-American. His son's an all-American wrestler. You didn't know that about the great Jim Jordan?

Matt Serra: I did not know that.

Donald Trump: Jim Jordan's great, but he brought all of the championship wrestlers in their divisions to the White House. And he said, that guy is going to be a UFC fighter, and that guy is going to do great.

Matt Serra: How long ago was that?

Donald Trump: Three years ago.

Matt Serra: Oh, wow.

Donald Trump: Three, four years ago.

Matt Serra: And now look at him now.

Jim Norton: Yeah.

Donald Trump: He's doing well.

Jim Norton: And they're telling us we have to wrap up with you. I can't believe this happened. I'm so happy you came on. I know you're starting to do podcasts, so I hope you had a good time on this --

Donald Trump: I'm doing a podcast if this is what it is.

Jim Norton: Yeah.

Donald Trump: This is a podcast, but they have a lot of cameras.

Jim Norton: There's a lot of people.

Donald Trump: But I will say this. I do it for Dana. And I do it for the Fertitta brothers, and they're so fantastic. And they've been so good, so good. And actually one of the daughters worked at the White House. And I can only tell you, she was so respected. She did such a great job at the White House. She worked as a -- doing various things at the White House and prime time, and everybody respected her.

Donald Trump: So, you know, it's good genes. When you have good genes, you have good genes. That's very important, right?

Matt Serra: Amen. Well, thanks so much.

Jim Norton: Thank you so much for coming on. This was really fun, and I'm happy you came.

Donald Trump: Thank you very much. Thank you very much. And say hello to everybody and have a good night.

Jim Norton: We will. Thank you.

Matt Serra: Thank you so much.

Donald Trump: Thank you very much.
