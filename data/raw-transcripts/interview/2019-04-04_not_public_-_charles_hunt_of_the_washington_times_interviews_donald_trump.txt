Note: [Charles Hunt of The Washington Times published parts of his interview with Donald Trump. These excerpts are available online.]

Note: [Hunt did not respond to multiple emails in regard to making a transcript available online. As such, our editorial policy is to exclude it from the index. This is not a reflection on Hunt's reporting or The Washington Times, but rather a reflection of our focus to be able to present interviews in their full context.]

Note: [We encourage The Washington Times to publish the transcript in full in order to contribute to the public record.]
