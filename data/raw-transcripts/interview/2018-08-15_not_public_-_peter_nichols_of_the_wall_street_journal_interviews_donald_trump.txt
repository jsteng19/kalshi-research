Note: [The Wall Street Journal's Peter Nicholas published articles using material from its 20-minute interview with Donald Trump.]

Note: [Because The Wall Street Journal has the entire interview, but has elected not to publish it in full, or to respond to requests for a transcript, our editorial policy is to exclude it from the index. This is not a reflection on The Wall Street Journal, but rather a reflection of our focus to be able to present interviews in their full context.]

Note: [We encourage The Wall Street Journal to reconsider its decision in order to contribute to the public record.]
