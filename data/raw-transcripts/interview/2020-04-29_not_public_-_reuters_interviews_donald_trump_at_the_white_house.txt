Note: [Reuters published articles and excerpts of its interview with Donald Trump. These excerpts are available online.]

Note: [Because Reuters has the entire interview, but has elected not to publish it in full as a stated policy, our editorial policy is to exclude it from the index. This is not a reflection on Reuters but rather a reflection of our focus to be able to present interviews in their full context.]

Note: [We encourage Reuters to reconsider its decision in order to contribute to the public record.]
