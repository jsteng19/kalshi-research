Andrew Schulz: Who do you think tried to take you out?

Donald Trump: So, I'm going to give you some big breaking news, all right?

Andrew Schulz: Barron is 18.

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Andrew Schulz: He's handsome.

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Andrew Schulz: He's tall. He's rich.

Donald Trump: He's got the whole ball game, that kid.

Andrew Schulz: He's unleashed in New York City.

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Andrew Schulz: Are you sure you want to reverse Roe v. Wade now?

Donald Trump: I'm going to make this country great again. It's not a great country right now.

Andrew Schulz: It's always a great country. It's always a great country.

Donald Trump: OK, well -- I'm good with names, you know.

Andrew Schulz: You are. Tampon Tim was good. Is that --

Donald Trump: With tampon Tim, it's hard to say. There are some like comrade Kamala.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: It's a little hard to say. She's not bad. But when you put the names together, it's a little -- like got to be able to --

Andrew Schulz: So, who do you think did it? Who do you think did it? That was the best dodge of the question ever. You almost charmed us out there.

Donald Trump: I'm trying to get out of it. How are we doing so far?

Akaash Singh: You're doing amazing. So, they're making us wrap up. We want you for longer.

Donald Trump: Give them a little more time, what the hell? These are great questions. What the hell? But they lie, and they know it's a lie. She lied about many things, and she's a liar. I have a hard time doing it to them. You know, I'm basically a truthful person --

Andrew Schulz: What does that mean?

Donald Trump: No, but practically --

Andrew Schulz: What does that mean?

Akaash Singh: What's basically?

Donald Trump: No, but --

Andrew Schulz: Hello, everybody. Welcome to Flagrant. And today, this is the first time that we've been able to say, we are sitting down with Mr. President. Mr. President, thank you so much --

Donald Trump: Thank you.

Andrew Schulz: For being here.

Donald Trump: Thank you very much. Thank you, fellas.

Andrew Schulz: Thank you, sir. Appreciate it.

Akaash Singh: Yeah

Andrew Schulz: This -- this is awesome. We have a bunch of questions. We're very, very grateful for your time.

Donald Trump: OK.

Andrew Schulz: I just -- I just became a dad. My buddy over there just became a dad, Mark.

Mark Gagnon: Yeah.

Andrew Schulz: And OK, so here's -- here's the first question.

Donald Trump: Go ahead.

Andrew Schulz: You have -- you have these children that are seemingly well-adjusted, successful. And I think, most importantly, they appear to like you.

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Andrew Schulz: OK.

Donald Trump: They better.

Andrew Schulz: I grew up in the city. I grew up in the city, and there's a lot of people who had like very wealthy parents. And like the kids kind of resent them --

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Andrew Schulz: Almost like waiting for them to like die. And they end up in like rehabs.

Akaash Singh: Doing drugs, God knows what, yeah.

Andrew Schulz: How do you raise them in the public eye, where they, you know, still --

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Andrew Schulz: Become ambitious and successful.

Donald Trump: So, I do have good kids and five really wonderful children, and different, very different. They are so different. But, you know, one thing that was in common that I did, I always used to say when I was with them or when they were leaving a room, I would drive them crazy, "No drugs, no alcohol, no cigarettes." I would say that.

Andrew Schulz: You say that to Donald Jr.?

Donald Trump: Yeah, Don's pretty little wild. He's a wild -- he's -- you know, he can be a little tough.

Andrew Schulz: He told me a funny story.

Donald Trump: Go ahead.

Andrew Schulz: OK, because I talked to a bunch of people. I was trying to you know, prepare for this interview. He told me a funny story. And he said to me, he goes once he asked if he could have a couple of friends over for New Years -- was it New Years -- no, no, it was July 4th --

Donald Trump: Right.

Andrew Schulz: On top of Trump Tower.

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Akaash Singh: Five friends.

Andrew Schulz: And you said yes. He's like, "I want five friends." You're like, "OK, I'm out of town go for it." He brings 200 people over to Trump Tower. OK?

Donald Trump: That's right.

Andrew Schulz: OK. He says that you weren't supposed to be there. You end up showing up. You hear some noise upstairs. You come up. You go, "What the fuck is everybody doing here? Get the hell out of my house." He said he cleaned for the next 36 hours. And he said, to this day, you have never brought up that it even happened.

Andrew Schulz: And he said I'm starting to believe it might not have happened. So --

Donald Trump: Yeah. It happened.

Andrew Schulz: Can you give him closure?

Donald Trump: No, it happened. No, I can never give closure. Yeah, you can -- you can never forget. A lot of people like to forget things. You can't -- no. He's a good guy. You know, he's taken a lot because he was always a good student. He went to the Wharton School of Finance, which is great, and he did well. But he -- he went into the world of politics, not because he wanted to, but because I was there.

Donald Trump: And I sort of automatically -- you drag -- you drag the family in. And this guy what he had to go through with Russia, Russia, Russia.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: He goes, "Dad, they're asking me questions about Russia. I don't know anything about Russia. What's going on?" And all of a sudden, he's in front of grand juries. He's in front of Congress.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: It was a hoax.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: It was a total hoax.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: This was a made-up hoax by crazy Nancy Pelosi and these, you know, the maniacs.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Hillary Clinton, who's totally nuts.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And this went on for two years. And, you know, he said "Dad, I know nothing about this." And you go before the grand jury. And, you know, Comey -- you have Comey who's the worst, just a bad guy. But he went through a lot. And it actually made him tougher. I don't know if that's good or bad, but he's a tough cookie that one.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And it made -- in his case, it made him tougher. Ivanka did a great job. She didn't want anything -- all she wanted to do was get people jobs. I would have made her the ambassador to the UN. I wanted to do that. I think she would have been incredible, the whole aura. She would have been great. But she didn't want that.

Donald Trump: She didn't -- and that would have been a very glamorous position.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: She would have been great there. All she did is go to see companies and hire people she wanted.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And she hired -- I think it was like 10 million people, some --

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Incredible amount of people. She'd go to Walmart, she'd go to Exxon, she'd go to these big companies and see if she could get groups of people hired.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And she loved doing it. It was great -- and she -- there was no glamor, there was no anything --

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: But she got people jobs that made her --

Andrew Schulz: So, how do you instill the ambition in the kids? I think a lot of kids that grow up with wealth --

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Andrew Schulz: They kind of are lazy, and they feel like they have no direction in life. and a lot of times they turn to drugs and other shit. How do you instill the ambition?

Donald Trump: Well, you know, I've seen a lot of wealthy families where the kids are mostly don't work out too well. Some don't turn out to be bad kids, but they end up hating the father, or the father maybe wanted him in business. I mean, I have one father that's very competitive with his son. He's -- if the son were more successful than him --

Andrew Schulz: He would hate it.

Donald Trump: He would be unhappy. I said, "Are you crazy? It's supposed to be the other way around."

Andrew Schulz: It's awesome.

Donald Trump: My father was so proud of me. He was -- he was a successful guy.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: But my father wanted me to be more successful. I mean, he was so proud of all the things. I wish he could have seen what happened --

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Because we did things. But he was, you know, he's just a proud father.

Andrew Schulz: What do you think --

Donald Trump: And I think most fathers are that way, I hope. But I've known many fathers that are very successful that didn't want their -- that broke up over their son's success. If you know -- in the few cases where the son was more successful, which was very seldom actually, you know, it was -- it's very seldom.

Donald Trump: You take people like in sports. Because in sports, you see it because it's a microcosm of life. But it's quicker. And you'll take like the greatest golfers, and they'll have a son, and he'll be really good as a young. But you -- they never supersede almost -- I can't think of any. They never supersede the father in terms of success.

Donald Trump: And in sports, generally. Baseball, you can go to a lot of different sports. And it really is a sort of a microcosm of life. But with life, it takes a lot longer to find out the --

Andrew Schulz: Come to fruition, yeah.

Akaash Singh: I'm sorry to interrupt you, but you said -- we said you're a great father up top. First thing you say is I've got great kids. You didn't take credit. And then, your entire answer -- I thought this was really cool, your entire answer is about how great your kids are. That was a very cool thing.

Donald Trump: Thank you. That's very nice. I think I like this interview. I think --

Akaash Singh: That's genuine.

Donald Trump: I think he's right.

Akaash Singh: I think --

Donald Trump: By the way, congratulations, I hear your show is like is crazy monster success.

Andrew Schulz: We're doing -- we're doing pretty good. We're very -- yeah, yeah, we're interviewing, you know, presidents, so --

Akaash Singh: Yeah.

Donald Trump: No, it's -- it's really good. And right in the middle of a campaign with only 29 days to go.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And you're taking up time.

Andrew Schulz: Yes, we are, just to talk about your family.

Akaash Singh: Yeah, we're just complimenting you.

Donald Trump: You know what it is? It's a different world out there. You guys and some others --

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: You know, you -- we had the standard television for many years. And that's still, I think -- you know, I think it's underrated now. I think it's still very important.

Andrew Schulz: Sure.

Donald Trump: But there's a whole new thing. Elon interviewed me on something.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And I think they said 275 million --

Akaash Singh: Wow.

Donald Trump: Hits are listed.

Andrew Schulz: That's a lot -- that's a lot of people.

Donald Trump: That was a record.

Akaash Singh: That's a nation. Yeah.

Donald Trump: But it's a whole new different way of getting the word out, right?

Andrew Schulz: Can I ask you question about Elon specifically? Is he your favorite African American?

Donald Trump: He's a piece of work, I tell you. You know he's a great guy.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: With -- I mean, he's obviously a brilliant guy.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: I mean, when I saw the rocket engines come back, I said, "What is that?" Like a couple of years ago, you know, I've seen rockets go up and then they crash into the water.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And I see the engines are coming back, and they're landing.

Andrew Schulz: It's unbelievable.

Donald Trump: They're landing, and they land on a raft in the middle of the ocean someplace --

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: With a little dot, and they land right on the top of the spot.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah. And my wife can't parallel park.

Donald Trump: I know. It's -- most people can't. But -- but no, he's great. But he's got a great heart. He was with me, as you know, on the other night.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And we were honoring a man who got killed at a rally, Corey, firefighter, great guy. And it was a beautiful evening. But Elon went out, and he loved the crowd.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: He loves the country.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And he's picked a side. A lot of people don't want to pick a side. I have a lot of people that are big supporters of me.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: But they -- they won't go all out. You know, they can't --

Andrew Schulz: They're scared. There's a cost.

Akaash Singh: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Yeah, there's a cost.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: There is a cost, but there's also a liability. I mean, you know, some people -- I respect it a lot when this guy was up there doing jumping jacks.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: You got to vote for Trump. You got to vote for Trump.

Andrew Schulz: He was jumping high.

Akaash Singh: Yeah.

Donald Trump: He was jumping high, you know --

Andrew Schulz: Looked quite African.

Donald Trump: When he jumped, he's in good shape. I looked -- I'm looking at his waist. I'm saying, "Wait a minute, does he work out or something?" But he is -- he really -- and he had a -- he had a great time. And, you know, he's -- he's not out that much. He's probably --

Andrew Schulz: No.

Donald Trump: Maybe a little. Would you say he's a little reclusive possibly?

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Akaash Singh: It seems.

Andrew Schulz: He's also busy. He's got like five different companies.

Donald Trump: He had -- he's very busy and maybe a little reclusive.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: But he -- he had the greatest time. He would say, "Look at these people." We had 100,000 -- more than 100,000 people.

Andrew Schulz: Yes, I saw.

Donald Trump: It was a record. It was nobody's ever seen.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And it was really -- it was a celebration of a life, and it was really a MAGA -- it was a MAGA deal.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: He was a big MAGA person. His family was there. And two other people that were very badly hurt were also celebrated.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: They were very badly hurt. They weren't actually expected to live.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And they lived, and they had incredible doctors. Some of those country doctors are better than the big doctors that we spend a lot of money on, and they don't do as good, I will tell you right now. I don't want to knock anybody, but those country doctors saved two people because I was told that three would --

Andrew Schulz: Country doctors.

Donald Trump: No, think of that. Three would be in trouble.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And three were going to -- now, Corey, immediately. But the other two were so bad --

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: That they thought they wouldn't make it.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And those country doctors, they pulled them -- they pulled them together. They did a great job.

Andrew Schulz: OK, so you're going back into this place where, you know, there was this assassination attempt.

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Andrew Schulz: They hit you headshot.

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Andrew Schulz: You survived.

Donald Trump: Yeah. It was not a good feeling.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah. Are you -- are you scared?

Akaash Singh: Yeah. You look -- by the way.

Donald Trump: No, I'm not scared. You know, I sort of -- I have an attitude, it's interesting. It sort of it is what it is.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Does that make any sense to you, guys? You know, you do what you have to do. I felt it was important to go back. A lot of people, I guess, agreed with me because it was over a hundred -- I think they said 108,000 people in the end. That's a lot of people.

Akaash Singh: It's terrible.

Donald Trump: And -- and I had no guitar. You know, if you have a guitar, it's easy. If you don't have a guitar --

Andrew Schulz: I thought you said Qatar.

Akaash Singh: Yeah.

Donald Trump: I have Qatar. I do have that. They like me very much. But -- but I don't have a guitar.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah, yeah, guitar. Yeah.

Donald Trump: Yeah. So, anyway -- but -- but that was an amazing -- it was amazing. I mean, no, I like it when somebody like Elon, who has a lot to lose --

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Is willing to do what's right.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Some people know it's right to do, and I'm not just talking about endorsements and all, but they don't want to do things --

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Because they're --

Andrew Schulz: They don't want it to cost them opportunities in the future.

Donald Trump: The word is political. They want to be politically correct.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And actually, they're doing a bad -- you know, a bad thing, I think, for themselves and for a lot of people they may represent.

Andrew Schulz: OK. Opening line when you walk out there.

Donald Trump: Right.

Andrew Schulz: I mean, I was -- I was wondering what you were going to say. And as a comedian, there's -- you can seize the moment.

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Andrew Schulz: And --

Donald Trump: He's a hell of a comedian, by the way.

Andrew Schulz: I appreciate that.

Donald Trump: That's what the word is.

Andrew Schulz: So, I hear you go -- I hear -- you know, I see the video, and you go up there. And you go, "As I was saying."

Donald Trump: Right.

Andrew Schulz: Crowd goes fucking berserk or what?

Donald Trump: They went, I would say, crazy.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah, yeah.

Donald Trump: I wasn't sure --

Andrew Schulz: [Inaudible] experience.

Donald Trump: I'll tell you how -- you know, you have this as a comedian or even as a -- not as a comedian, just when you make a speech or you make some very serious statement.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: So, we're at a very serious and somber thing --

Andrew Schulz: Event, yeah.

Donald Trump: Because we're celebrating a life that is no longer with us. And I wasn't sure whether or not that thing -- I had it in my mind for a long time. Once I said I'm going back, which I wanted to go back immediately, I wanted to actually finish my speech, OK? When I got up, I said, "Let me finish my speech."

Donald Trump: But I'm surrounded by like eight very large strong men --

Andrew Schulz: Yeah, yeah.

Donald Trump: And a very wonderful woman. You saw that.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Donald Trump: But I'm surrounded by guys. They said, "Sir, no way you're going." And I had blood pouring down. But I wanted to -- I really wanted to finish my speech. I said, I think I had like 50,000. I had a lot of people there.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah, yeah.

Donald Trump: And, you know, when I went down, it was sort of like embarrassed. I said, "I went down in front of all these people." You know, that was my first thing. I said, "I don't want to be embarrassed."

Andrew Schulz: You were embarrassed --

Donald Trump: I wanted to -- yeah.

Andrew Schulz: You went down after being shot, you were --

Donald Trump: Well, you weren't exactly sure what the hell was happening at first, you know.

Akaash Singh: But also, you came back up with a fist raised. That's one of the hardest pictures.

Donald Trump: No, I did. But I was also, you know --

Andrew Schulz: Did you hear them say he's down? Or were you just like I'm going --

Donald Trump: So, when I got hit, I assume that -- it's funny.

Andrew Schulz: Is it?

Donald Trump: When I was -- it is sort of strange. I guess, now, it's a little bit -- we can smile a little bit, but not really because three guys, one killed one, two very badly.

Andrew Schulz: Of course, of course, yeah.

Donald Trump: But when I went down, I had total realization. It wasn't a surreal -- you know, they talked about a surreal -- that could be a surreal experience. Like, when somebody -- something happens -- some traumatic thing happens, people are -- they lose focus, they have no idea where they are. They -- you know, I've heard many people where that happens, something really terrible happens like that.

Andrew Schulz: Of course, yeah.

Donald Trump: It was just the opposite. I knew exactly what had happened. I got shot in the ear, and Secret Service thought I may have been shot -- actually, they were pretty sure that I was shot all over because there was a lot of blood. Just a little fact, if you get shot in the ear, it's the bloodiest place. It bleeds more than anything else.

Andrew Schulz: Oh, wow.

Donald Trump: Now, it's good to be shot this way, not that way.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah, yeah.

Akaash Singh: Yeah, yeah.

Donald Trump: That way --

Andrew Schulz: Yeah, that's when it's bad.

Donald Trump: So, if I don't -- if I -- if I don't turn, I -- I wouldn't be doing this right now. I guarantee you.

Andrew Schulz: [Inaudible] guys, I got some stand-up shows coming up for The Life Tour. These are the remaining shows of The Life Tour. This weekend, we'll be in Minneapolis and Milwaukee. We are going to Denver the following week. We have added a third show there. We're also going to Cincinnati that weekend. We had a second show there, Rama, Ontario as well.

Andrew Schulz: We're also going to be going to Salt Lake City. We added a second show there. Reno, we have two shows. San Jose, we added a second show. Portland, and then we are wrapping up the tour, December 21st, at Honolulu, Hawaii at the Blaisdell Arena. I'm probably pronouncing that wrong. Anyway, thank you guys so much for coming out to this tour.

Andrew Schulz: It's been absolutely incredible. Theandrewschulz.com for tickets, don't get and try the resellers. Go grab those. I will see you out there. Thank you so much. Peace.

Akaash Singh: Also, show dates, October 10th. We got a show tomorrow is sold out. You can't come. October 17th through 19th, I'm at the Stress Factory. We already sold out six shows. We're adding a seventh. Hurry up, and buy those tickets. I keep telling you, it will sell out. I am in India, essentially. It's new Jersey.

Akaash Singh: These tickets are selling out like hotcakes, hot jalebi, if you will. October 17th, we added a 4:30 p.m. show. That's how crazy it is. Buy those fucking tickets. I said the 17th, I meant the 19th. Also, 25th, 26th, I'm in Richmond, Virginia. Hurry up, and buy those tickets. November 1st and 2nd, buy those tickets.

Akaash Singh: I'm in Lexington, Kentucky. All those dates are at akaashsingh.com. Also, I'm still at FanBasis doing the damn thing. If you want to place your bets with stake, I'm going to get picks from betting experts. You suck at gambling, be honest with yourself for once in your life. You ain't won shit in your life.

Akaash Singh: And I know this because I probably know sports more than most of y'all, and I still be losing. So, I just steal these guys' picks because they're professional cappers, they call them. That means they're professional gamblers. This is a little euphemism. Anyway, I'm also going to talk some sports on there.

Akaash Singh: We're going to live stream this Thursday, do a little live stream during the Thursday night football game. We're just going to have some fun talk, some sports. If you missed that, come see me, FanBasis. let's get back to the show.

Donald Trump: My son, Don, told me -- actually, he's a great shooter. So is Eric, they're great shooters. They're like better than scratch, OK, if you --

Akaash Singh: Yeah, yeah.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And they say it's amazing because it was 130 yards. To me that sounds like far away --

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: But it's not for shooting. It's not -- he said that would be like sinking a one-foot putt for just a decent shooter.

Akaash Singh: Wow.

Donald Trump: And I don't know if you guys are shooters, but they said if you're a shooter, it's almost impossible to miss. It's that close.

Akaash Singh: Wow.

Donald Trump: It's really considered that close. I mean 300, 400, 500 yards is very doable. But this is supposed to be very close. And so, he said -- I think Don became more religious, actually, you want to know the truth. It had a big impact. He said it's impossible. It's just -- the doctor, actually, when I got to the hospital, they were fantastic, Butler Hospital.

Donald Trump: I get there and the doctor greeted me, and he looked at me and looked it over. He said, "You are the luckiest man I've ever met.

Akaash Singh: Wow.

Donald Trump: He said you should immediately go out and buy a lotto ticket. Can you imagine telling me to buy a lotto ticket? There's blood all over the place.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And he said, I've never -- he said, "I've been doing this for 25 years." I said -- he said, "I've never seen a thing like this.

Akaash Singh: Wow.

Donald Trump: Because it's just whacked, whacked it.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: But it was something that was, you know, relatively -- relatively not so bad compared to what could have happened. So, I feel very lucky. It was an amazing experience, a horrible experience in most ways. In some ways, it was beautiful because I was somehow -- somehow I -- hopefully, Corey's protected, too, who's the firefighter.

Donald Trump: And he's in a good place, maybe a better place than we're in.

Akaash Singh: Hopefully, yeah.

Donald Trump: Because this world is a little bit on the tough side.

Akaash Singh: Right.

Donald Trump: But it was a -- it was an amazing experience.

Akaash Singh: Is there any --

Andrew Schulz: Do you feel like an increase in your spirituality after something like that?

Donald Trump: Well, maybe, especially when I'm hearing from people that do shoot and are good at it that it was almost impossible to miss from -- you know, like a one-foot putt --

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: It's very hard. You got to miss it. It's a bad putt, right?

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Akaash Singh: Yeah.

Donald Trump: He equated it to a one-foot putt. When they say that, I say, "Wow, that's -- so you're saying --" they said, "A bad shooter would hit you from that distance 100 percent of the time."

Akaash Singh: Wow, yeah.

Donald Trump: That's pretty -- that's pretty bad.

Akaash Singh: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And here I am, I'm -- we're doing this wonderful interview with four geniuses that are hot as pistols, right? Look at the hair in this guy.

Mark Gagnon: Right.

Alexx Media: Yeah.

Mark Gagnon: Likewise, sir.

Donald Trump: It's pretty -- pretty good stuff you got there. So, anyway, so -- but here we are.

Andrew Schulz: Who do you think tried to take you out?

Donald Trump: So -- So I'm going to give you some big breaking news, right.

Akaash Singh: I love that.

Donald Trump: Because you're -- I know the kind of show and it's entertainment, but it's also very serious. I mean I get the whole picture. And you know what, if it was just funny stuff, you wouldn't have the success you've got, to be honest with you, right?

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: It's nice to intersperse it, but I'll give you something. So, first of all, I have great respect for the Secret Service. And the guys that were with me, I went down and I did a good job going down because those bullets were winging over my head. If I would have been up for another couple of seconds, I also wouldn't have been there.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: But I didn't consider that as lucky as turning to the right at that one -- it was like one-sixteenth of a second.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Akaash Singh: Yeah.

Donald Trump: It was the only time that I was safe, essentially.

Akaash Singh: Right.

Donald Trump: if I would have gone a little further, I would have been hit. If I would have gone not as far, I would have been hit. I mean I had like this little tiny moment. And the amazing thing is the slide is always on my left, and it's always at the end, and I only use it 20 percent of the time, maybe even less than that. This was a chart --

Andrew Schulz: This time it's on the right.

Donald Trump: This was a chart on immigration.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Because I have the record. I did a great job in immigration. They are not doing too well right now.

Andrew Schulz: Stay on the breaking news. Stay on the breaking news.

Donald Trump: So, here's the thing. So -- so you have this shooter, and you have another shooter, right? So, this shooter had three or so cell phones. The FBI's never gotten them opened.

Akaash Singh: Wow.

Donald Trump: The other shooter, three apps, they call them, and I believe they were foreign-based apps from what I understand.

Akaash Singh: Oh, wow.

Donald Trump: They haven't opened them, and they're foreign-based. And you know you hear all about Iran because I was rough with Iran, but I want to see Iran do great. I want to see Iran do great.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: But I want to stop all the killing, and all this.

Andrew Schulz: Right.

Donald Trump: And -- and I was rough on Iran. And they supposedly have a hit on me. In fact, I think it takes great courage for you people to be interviewing me because it could be now, you know.

Akaash Singh: Well, we didn't know that before we got in here.

Donald Trump: Because if you would have known that you might not have done this.

Akaash Singh: Yeah, exactly, exactly.

Alexx Media: The Secret Service [Inaudible]

Donald Trump: This is a good way of me getting the interview to be shorter.

Andrew Schulz: Exactly.

Donald Trump: All of a sudden, he's going to say, "You know, OK, that's it. Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.

Andrew Schulz: I'm going to go see my daughter.

Akaash Singh: Yeah.

Donald Trump: They have three apps and foreign-based. Two of them, maybe three of them are foreign-based.

Akaash Singh: Wow.

Donald Trump: They haven't opened them yet. Why wouldn't you open them when you hear about Iran or when you hear about, you know, foreign -- and the other one had six cell phones, and they haven't open -- now, you know, it's very hard to open a cell phone. Only Apple can do it in theory unless you have somebody. But they had no problem getting the J6 people's cell phones open.

Donald Trump: They opened their cell phones very quickly. You know, we have two countries in a way. What's happening here is very bad. It's very dangerous. We almost had one because I had the greatest economy in the history of our country, and people were coming together. We almost had one. But we really do have two right now, and it's a shame because I think we'll get them together.

Donald Trump: Success will bring us together. But they should get those phones opened. And, you know, when there's an assassination attempt on a former president who's now, I'm proud to say, leading in all the polls against the Democrat, I don't know which one is running. You know, you don't know what the hell's going on.

Donald Trump: I'm the only one that had to run against two. I run against two Democrats. But this is the first. We do -- we create a lot of firsts. Usually, you run against somebody. Here, I run -- I had the debate, I was way up on him --

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And then, they say, oh, let's put -- this is like with Dana White, a fighter. So, you're fighting, and the one guy is getting killed. And they say, "Oh, that's OK. Let's put in another fighter --"

Andrew Schulz: Tug him in.

Donald Trump: To finish it off. And you're fighting, you say, "Hey, wait a minute. I have a brand-new fighter in here."

Akaash Singh: WWE.

Donald Trump: I spent $150 million on beating Biden. And then, all of a sudden, I hear that they're going to overthrow him. It was a -- it was a coup.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: I mean, it really was. But I would like them to -- to open up these apps and find out what's in there. And so, he had six -- six cell phones. Who has six cell phones? Having six cell phones is weird. I have cell phones. If I ever have two, it's like a lot.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: He had six cell phones. Why does he have them? and why haven't they opened up those cell phones.

Akaash Singh: So, if you had to guess --

Donald Trump: And it's different. You know, if you're a drug dealer, I think it's terrible in many ways. But I guess from another standpoint, Apple, the primary group, people buy those phones because they will never open them for any reason.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: But they got them open on J6. You know, they opened up their phones, but they don't open -- and this is big stuff. This is an assassination attempt. And it could involve other countries.

Andrew Schulz: There was that San Bernardino shooter that they hacked -- the FBI was able to hack into the phone. Apple didn't give it up, but they were --

Donald Trump: There are some people in the world, very few, that can -- that have an ability to sometimes be able to hack in.

Andrew Schulz: Got it.

Donald Trump: Very rarely. Actually.

Akaash Singh: Yeah.

Donald Trump: it's an amazing thing. When you think that with all the genius, you almost can't do it. But Apple has a key. And the key is -- I mean it just -- they can do it immediately.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: But they don't do it, and they don't do it. And that's one of the reasons that, like, I hate to say it, drug lords feel very confident that they'll never be exposed. And they use their cell phones --

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Their Apple phones. And maybe it's that way with other companies. I don't know, they have Samsung, they have other companies. But it's very hard -- Apple is very strong on that. But when it comes to the assassination of a president, leading candidate --

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Former president, all that, I think the rules have to go out, and they have to open those things and they have to find out. And, you know --

Andrew Schulz: And in terms of national security --

Donald Trump: Some people would say you have to either punish Apple, or you have to get somebody that can do it. But in terms of national security -- so the one guy has six phones, lots of messages to people, who are those people he's calling when he's hiding behind the bush.

Akaash Singh: So, if you had to guess, I'm sure you've thought -- obviously, you've thought about this a lot. It's an assassination attempt. If you had to guess, who do you think is responsible?

Donald Trump: These are great questions. What the hell? I don't get these questions from the fake news.

Akaash Singh: Yeah, Rosie O'Donnell is not asking this.

Donald Trump: Like "Deface the Nation," they have the woman, Brennan, she's on "Deface the Nation." She was terrible with, you know, the way she handled JD Vance, who did a great job the other night.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Akaash Singh: He did a great job.

Donald Trump: But I don't get questions like that. Did you ever hear of the show "Deface" -- ladies and gentlemen, it's Donald Trump on "Deface the Nation." It's called "Face the Nation." They hate me. They spend -- they spend millions of dollars --

Andrew Schulz: No, I've -- I was like they would name a show that?

Donald Trump: Oh, I see. They spend -- oh, you didn't hear it. That's good. They spend millions of dollars on the name, CBS.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And then, I come along, and I say "Deface" -- it's "Face the Nation," it's a well-known show.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Or "Meet the Fake Press," you know, "Meet the Press."

Andrew Schulz: You're good at this.

Donald Trump: I say "Meet the Fake Press."

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And they spend all this money, and then I say it once and it goes to millions of people.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: But, no, they are fake. But some of these questions -- some of these questions are much better.

Akaash Singh: Well, thank you. I appreciate that. I'm honored.

Donald Trump: Much better.

Akaash Singh: You still haven't answered, though.

Andrew Schulz: That was the best part of the question.

Akaash Singh: That was almost -- that's your second best dodge in your life.

Andrew Schulz: You almost charmed us out of it.

Donald Trump: I'm trying to get out of it.

Akaash Singh: All right, fair enough.

Donald Trump: Well, look, if you look at assassinations or attempts, first of all, you realize I'm in a very dangerous business.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Because one -- one-tenth -- think of this, one-tenth of 1 percent of auto racers die.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Bull riders, I think that's pretty dangerous, right?

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: I don't know much about it, but I think it's -- I wouldn't want to be on one of those suckers.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: I see them flying off in the hoof just like an inch from the eye. And when it hits the eye, you're gone, right?

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: They are very -- well, it's about the same, one-tenth of 1 percent.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And other things. It's never much more than that, that's sort of maxed out. I think. You know --

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Race car drivers, bull riders, I think that's pretty much tough.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: UFC fighters, it's none. You know, I don't think anyone's ever actually --

Andrew Schulz: Not in UFC. In MMA or boxing, unfortunately, those tragic events, yeah.

Donald Trump: Amazingly, boxers die a lot. But UFC, Dana tells me it's a safe sport. I say to me it's much rougher. But you know, it's pretty amazing. They've never -- in UFC, they've never lost.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And they run a great operation. They've never -- nobody's died. But with presidents, it's like a substantial percentage --

Akaash Singh: Way higher than we realize, yeah.

Donald Trump: When you look at Lincoln and Kennedy and this and that --

Akaash Singh: Attempts, Reagan --

Donald Trump: McKinley.

Mark Gagnon: Yeah. Garfield.

Donald Trump: You look at a lot of people.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: I'm in a very dangerous

Andrew Schulz: Dangerous business.

Donald Trump: Profession.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Akaash Singh: Yeah.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: I call it a profession.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Dangerous profession.

Andrew Schulz: I like that.

Donald Trump: I'm sitting with you guys, you have a very nice safe life.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Me? So, no, if you said 5 percent --

Andrew Schulz: I think he called a soft.

Donald Trump: No, but think about that. Yeah, but think of it, 5 percent.

Akaash Singh: Yeah.

Donald Trump: That's a lot.

Akaash Singh: That's high.

Donald Trump: That's a lot I think. Yeah.

Andrew Schulz: I think --

Donald Trump: And --

Andrew Schulz: I think even the attempts is something like --

Donald Trump: Attempts.

Andrew Schulz: Twenty-five percent of presidents have had attempts --

Donald Trump: Attempts is getting into a really --

Andrew Schulz: It's crazy.

Donald Trump: So, people don't think of that. You know, you run and you see and then you win, and you're down Pennsylvania. You're looking at everything. So, you got to -- you're in a dangerous --

Andrew Schulz: Dangerous, yeah.

Donald Trump: And so it's one of those things. I was saying before, though, that you know I do a thing called the weave. And there are those that are fair that say this guy is so genius. And then, others would say, "Oh, he rambled." I don't ramble.

Andrew Schulz: A weave, yeah.

Donald Trump: If I start a story, what you do is you weave things in -- you do it. You have to have certain things you need -- you need an extraordinary memory because you have to come back to where you started.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: You always -- a weave is only good if you come back.

Andrew Schulz: They're giving you credit for that.

Akaash Singh: That's true.

Andrew Schulz: If you could go all the way over here, and then get back.

Donald Trump: I can go so far here or there, and I can come back to exactly where I started. Now, someday when you don't come back to where you started --

Andrew Schulz: You're Biden.

Donald Trump: And you say -- no, but the weave is the way. When you're telling like a story, I was telling a story at a rally the other day in front of thousands of people, and I started off --

Andrew Schulz: You will weave them up.

Donald Trump: And then, something in the story, I actually mentioned Air Force One. It was Air Force One mistake. So, I mentioned Air Force One. And then, I said how I got $1.6 billion off the price of Air Force One. So, but then you have to come back to the story, where was Air Force One taken?

Andrew Schulz: [Inaudible] yeah.

Donald Trump: So, anyway, I do a weave, I call it the weave. And some people think it's so genius. But the bad people, what they say is, "You know, he was rambling."

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: There's no rambling.

Andrew Schulz: It's a weave.

Donald Trump: This is a weave. I call it the weave. Good name. I'm not sure. That's another name. We had fake news.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: We came up with lots of names.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: But the weave is -- I think we should make the weave a part of that stable.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah. I think you --

Donald Trump: Yeah, you're really weaving without answering my question twice.

Andrew Schulz: [Inaudible] I don't even want to know the answer anymore.

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Alexx Media: Yeah.

Akaash Singh: Yeah.

Andrew Schulz: [Inaudible] keep weaving.

Akaash Singh: I lost -- I lost --

Donald Trump: We'll weave back.

Alexx Media: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Let's weave back to his question. This is where -- this is where it started. We'll weave back to his question, So, I sort of hate answering it because --

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Akaash Singh: Yeah.

Donald Trump: I don't want to give any false identities. I don't want to do anything having to do with creating something that isn't there. You would look at Iran. Iran has an open threat out for me.

Andrew Schulz: Right.

Donald Trump: And that's bad. And Biden, if he were a real president, if he were the kind of guy he should be --

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Should say, "If anybody shoots a former president, who's now the leading candidate, even though he's leading against Democrats, we will bomb that country into oblivion." And it would stop. And that's been said before with some people. You know, there have been people. I won't go into it. But there have been people that have been threatened in another party even.

Donald Trump: In the same party, it makes sense and probably happens pretty quickly.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: But in another party, you know, it's hard for them to --

Andrew Schulz: To cross the line.

Donald Trump: To want to protect me.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: But it shouldn't be hard. Other people have protected other people. And what you have to inform those people is if they do it, the country will be blown to smithereens. The entire country will be blown to smithereens. And those threats go away because that's a really bad threat for a country.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Forget about me, I'm an individual. But I represent something very important.

Akaash Singh: That's true.

Donald Trump: That's a really terrible threat.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: So, I mean, there are others that could be in that category. Look, I took in hundreds of billions of dollars from China at a level that no president -- no president took in anything. I had tariffs on China, took in hundreds of billions of dollars. They're still there that, without me, they wouldn't have those tariffs.

Donald Trump: So, you could say. But, no, I think Iran would be the one.

Andrew Schulz: All right, guys. Let's take a break for a second because we got to shout out the greatest law firm in America, Morgan and Morgan, America's largest personal injury law firm. For over 35 years, they've been fighting and winning for the people just like you and me. They've won so much that they've racked up more than $20 billion in recoveries for their clients.

Andrew Schulz: That's right, billion with a B. So, when life tries to slam you with an injury, it might be time to tap in to Morgan and Morgan. And because they've got your back, I'm excited to announce that they are offering one lucky listener $2,000 and two tickets to WWE's Royal Rumble. Now, entering to win is easy.

Andrew Schulz: Let me tell you. All you have to do right now is text FLAGRANT to 4-THE-PEOPLE and follow the text prompts. Good luck. Maybe we'll see you there at WrestleMania. Now, let's get back to the show.

Akaash Singh: All right, guys. I'm going to do this and read again because Myles really doesn't want me to and I want to add to his workload. You got to know about CookieUnity, man. It's a meal delivery service where meals are actually prepared by award-winning professional chefs. Every meal is prepared in small batches to ensure the highest level of quality and culinary craft.

Akaash Singh: How do I know this? I don't know, maybe there's a little collaboration coming, front to back. There are hundreds of weekly menu items you can choose from dozens of global cuisines, and they got an app that offers a seamless experience to make ordering and planning as easy, pain-free as possible. This is the only meal delivery service that offers you cooking without compromise.

Akaash Singh: You don't got to cook. Professional chefs do the cooking. But you get top-tier quality, variety, convenience. And it's as little as $6 per meal. And if you visit cookunity.com for Flagrant listeners, you get 50 percent off your first order and 10 percent off your next three weeks. All you got to do is sign up at cookunity.

Akaash Singh: com/flagrant. Guys, that's all you got to do. cookunity.com/flagrant. And again, keep an eye out, your boy might have a little something cooking. Let's get back to the show.

Donald Trump: I was tough with other countries, but I got along very well with them. But, you know, we were like -- we were like a pussycat. We were ripped off by every nation in the world. And some of the worst rippers were our so-called allies, people that -- countries that we supposedly get along with us with -- but they're the ones that took advantage of us on trade at a level like -- you know, I mean, I ended some of the dumbest trade deals I've ever seen and made them much better for the country.

Donald Trump: I mean, what difference does it make? I made -- I made -- I took a terrible trade deal, we'd make it a good trade deal. But like Japan, I redid the trade deal. South Korea, I did the trade deal. The deals, I went to Abe of Japan, I said -- Shinzo, he was assassinated.

Andrew Schulz: He was -- he was --

Donald Trump: As you probably know, he was incredible. Great man. He was a great leader for the people. They loved him. I said, "Shinzo, look. We can't do this. The trade deal is so bad. We're friends, but I have to renegotiate the trade deal." And he said to me, "I knew that would happen." I said, "Why did you know?" "Because you're right, it's so one-sided."

Akaash Singh: Wow.

Donald Trump: it's like he said, "I knew you'd catch us." But they went through many presidents where Japan was -- as an example, they'll send us millions of cars. We're not allowed to send them any. They send us their farm product, we were sending them practically nothing. It was like a one-way -- everything was one way.

Donald Trump: And by the way, virtually every -- China was the worst, but there were many countries almost as bad. The European Union was almost as bad, in my opinion. It sounds nice. "Oh, the European Union is so nice." They were ruthless in their trading. And I said to Angela Merkel, "How many Chevrolets do we have in the middle of Berlin?" "Why? I don't believe any."

Donald Trump: I said, "You're right." And yet we take in the, you know, all of that. We take in Mercedes-Benz, Mercedes, BMW, and we take in all of this --

Andrew Schulz: Volkswagen.

Donald Trump: We're taking in all of these millions and millions of cars. I say, "How many American cars are in the middle of Munich or Berlin?" And the answer is none. And I had things changed around. So, you know, you could say -- I think that the answer would be, at this moment, Iran. And I think they could catch him.

Donald Trump: And if we had a real president, which we don't -- we don't have a real president. We have a man that is grossly inept. And it's very dangerous because these guys are all at the top of their game. When you talk about President Xi and you talk about any one of the leaders in the world. Macron, he's a smart guy. He's all for France. I mean, he would --

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: He would take the shirt off your back if you didn't know what you were doing.

Andrew Schulz: So, when you're with these guys, are these guys all sharks?

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Andrew Schulz: And you can sense the energy immediately?

Donald Trump: Yeah. Not all of them, but some of them aren't sharks in terms --

Andrew Schulz: How are you assessing personality when you meet them?

Donald Trump: Well, I can tell you like --

Akaash Singh: Great.

Donald Trump: Modi, India.

Akaash Singh: Yeah.

Donald Trump: He's a friend of mine. He's great. He's the nicest --

Andrew Schulz: India.

Akaash Singh: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Oh, good. Well, I'll tell you -- do you like him or not?

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Do you like him?

Akaash Singh: I have family on both sides of it. I have family that loves everything and family that does not.

Donald Trump: I'll just tell you. Well, they had -- you know, before him, they had -- they were replacing them every year. It was very unstable. He came along.

Akaash Singh: He's an [Inaudible]

Donald Trump: He's -- he's great. He's a friend of mine. But on the outside, he looks like he's your father. He's the nicest total killer because I asked him --

Akaash Singh: Yeah.

Donald Trump: We're talking -- I did -- they did a thing called Howdy Modi in Houston, Texas.

Akaash Singh: Oh, yeah, yeah.

Donald Trump: And they filled up the stadium. It was me and him.

Akaash Singh: Yeah.

Donald Trump: We -- we filled up the stadium. It was beautiful. Like 80,000 people was going crazy. And we're walking around. Today, maybe I wouldn't be as -- maybe you wouldn't do that.

Akaash Singh: Yeah.

Donald Trump: But we're walking -- walking in the middle waving to everybody. Anyway, but we have a very good relationship. He's the nicest human being. But we had a couple of occasions where somebody was threatening India.

Akaash Singh: Yeah.

Donald Trump: I said, "Let me help. I'm very good with those people. Let me help." "I will do it. I will do it, then I will do anything necessary. We've defeated them for hundreds of years."

Akaash Singh: Wow.

Donald Trump: He was talking about a certain country. Yeah, you can probably guess the country.

Akaash Singh: Yeah.

Andrew Schulz: I can't fathom which.

Donald Trump: You know the country.

Akaash Singh: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Donald Trump: But I said, "Whoa, what happened there? What happened?" So, no, they're all tough and they're all smart. And some are very good people. He's a good person.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: There's some good people and some aren't good people.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: But they're all at the top of their game

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And we have her who is now more important than him, I guess. Although he's still a president of this country --

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And we're talking about nuclear war.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And he's not capable. He doesn't even know what it is.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: He said yesterday when they talked about should they hit Iran's nuclear. "No, no, you shouldn't do that." I said, "It's just the opposite." Because the nuclear is the biggest threat we have in the world today. It's not global warming where the oceans are rising one-eighth of an inch in the next 500 years.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: The threat that we have, the biggest threat is nuclear war.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah. You seem concerned about that --

Donald Trump: I am because -- because it only takes one

Andrew Schulz: True.

Akaash Singh: Very true.

Donald Trump: They have five countries now that have capability. And soon, they'll have more. And we shouldn't let there be more. And I was at a point very good, despite the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax, it was a total hoax. And we were totally exonerated and everything else could have told them that the first day.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: But -- but that poses, you know, a lot of problems

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: A lot of problems. And they're a big nuclear power. We were close to a deal for getting rid of nuclear weapons. It would be so good.

Andrew Schulz: For all countries or just Russia?

Donald Trump: We were talking about Russia, ourselves, and China.

Andrew Schulz: Oh, wow.

Donald Trump: And we would then bring everyone else into it strongly.

Andrew Schulz: You all would get rid of your nuclear capabilities?

Donald Trump: Denuclearize, yes. We were going to get rid of --

Andrew Schulz: Wow.

Akaash Singh: Totally denuclearize.

Donald Trump: Nuclear. Because it's too powerful.

Akaash Singh: Yeah.

Donald Trump: It's too much.

Akaash Singh: Yeah.

Donald Trump: You know, my uncle, Dr. John Trump was the --

Andrew Schulz: Country doctor.

Donald Trump: Yeah. Dr. John Trump. Well, he was a nuclear doctor, actually.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: He was -- he was at MIT. He's the longest-serving professor at MIT. He passed away. Great guy. He was a brilliant guy, a brilliant scientist. And he used to tell me, he said -- a long time ago, he'd say, "Donald, someday, it's very dangerous. Somebody will be able to carry a small briefcase into a building in New York and blow up the entire city."

Akaash Singh: Oh, wow.

Donald Trump: I said, "You got to be kidding me, Uncle John. That will never happen." He was like a really brilliant guy. He was there for, I think, 41 years. He's the longest serving professor in the history of MIT.

Akaash Singh: Oh, wow.

Donald Trump: So, when I understand physics and when I understand things well, they say how come you -- I have, there's good genetics. You know, I'm a believer. Are you guys believers in that? Were your parents funny?

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Were they comedians?

Andrew Schulz: Yeah. My mom's side was -- is Scottish.

Akaash Singh: Fellow Scottish here.

Donald Trump: Oh.

Andrew Schulz: Scottish women tend to be --

Donald Trump: You know, my mom --

Andrew Schulz: Yeah, I was going to ask you about that. Yeah.

Donald Trump: And she was great.

Andrew Schulz: Well, is that where you get your humor from?

Donald Trump: Yeah. Well, I tell you what, England at the time they --

Andrew Schulz: Yeah, they call it.

Donald Trump: Fought them for a thousand years trying to get them under tow, they couldn't do it.

Andrew Schulz: They couldn't do it.

Donald Trump: They're very tough.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: That reminds me of my mother, come to think of it. My mother was -- my mother was great. She was a Stornoway.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: The Hebrides. Right? That's -- you know, that's really serious Scottish.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: But she was great. But it is true, when you see "Braveheart," that was one of many times. You know for hundreds --

Andrew Schulz: Did you watch that with your mom by any chance?

Donald Trump: No, I didn't. I didn't get to. I'll tell you, I saw "Braveheart." I think Mel Gibson is a very good guy. I've met him --

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: A number of times. Good guy. But I'll tell you, that was super Mel Gibson in his prime.

Akaash Singh: Oh, yeah, yeah.

Donald Trump: So -- and I was on a plane and there was absolutely nothing to do. It was one of these planes that you couldn't make calls you couldn't do and they had tapes.

Andrew Schulz: That's all planes for us.

Donald Trump: And they showed me like -- they showed -- no, but they showed me -- they showed me, "Sir, we have 20 tapes." And I looked at the tapes, and they were all there. And this was like 20 years after it was made. This was probably six years ago. I never saw "Braveheart."

Andrew Schulz: OK.

Akaash Singh: Oh, wow.

Donald Trump: And they showed me a tape. And I said, "All right, let's put that one on." And within about four minutes, I said, "This may be the greatest movie I've ever seen."

Akaash Singh: That's incredible.

Alexx Media: Within four minutes.

Donald Trump: Now, I'm a "Braveheart" fan, but you -- you've seen it.

Akaash Singh: Yeah.

Andrew Schulz: Oh, dude, I saw it with my mom. She was emotional for like a week.

Donald Trump: I mean, how good -- oh, I wish I saw it with my mother.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: But it was great --

Andrew Schulz: Was that your "Braveheart" moment, like after getting shot when you stood up?

Donald Trump: No, no, no.

Andrew Schulz: Freedom.

Donald Trump: You don't think of that in those moments. You do what you do.

Andrew Schulz: Thank God you weren't thinking about Mel Gibson.

Donald Trump: No, but he's -- he's good. But he was -- when he -- in prime time, he was unbelievable.

Akaash Singh: Oh, wow, unbelievable. Quite a run.

Donald Trump: I mean, at that -- you know his look, his way, his -- you couldn't have had a better guy playing it.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: But it was -- that was a great movie. So --

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: But it is true. England and, you know --

Andrew Schulz: Scotland for a few years.

Donald Trump: At the time, they -- for a thousand years.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah, yeah.

Donald Trump: I mean, they'd have -- and they'd have the battles with thousands or once a thousand --

Akaash Singh: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And they run at each other. Tell me that. You think --

Andrew Schulz: Yeah. I mean -- yeah.

Donald Trump: You think that takes guts?

Mark Gagnon: Yeah.

Donald Trump: They run at each other.

Alexx Media: I think so.

Donald Trump: Knowing they're going to pretty much die, right?

Andrew Schulz: The Roman army built walls to keep out the Scottish --

Donald Trump: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Andrew Schulz: When they were up in England.

Donald Trump: Yeah, they were afraid of the Scottish.

Andrew Schulz: They were afraid.

Donald Trump: The Scottish people, they're tough people, they're good people. Actually, they're very great people, but they're good fighters.

Andrew Schulz: But your mom was funny?

Donald Trump: She was funny, yes.

Andrew Schulz: That's what I hear.

Donald Trump: She was --

Andrew Schulz: I hear she --

Donald Trump: She had a great sense of humor. And my father loved my mother. You know, they were married for

Andrew Schulz: Yeah. Polar opposites, though?

Donald Trump: Yeah, my father was a German --

Andrew Schulz: Serious.

Donald Trump: Serious but good. He was a tough guy, but he had a good heart. When he walked down the street, and they'd say we could walk down the street, he would always give something to -- if there was somebody that had problems. They used to have the can and a pencil --you know the can. My father would always put $100 in that thing.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Akaash Singh: Oh, wow.

Donald Trump: He'd always do it. He had a tremendous heart, but he was a tough guy. He was tough. He was -- he was just like no nonsense. It was firm. My mother was a woman -- and I don't know how your mother felt, but she loved the queen. Don't forget the queen was, you know, the queen was great. Oh, would she have liked -- because the queen honored me before she died.

Akaash Singh: Really?

Donald Trump: She honored me as the president in Buckingham Palace. And there's nobody that does it like the English. There's nobody that has that, you know, the pomp and ceremony. But -- but my mother would have loved that. Your mother, so did she feel strongly about like the royalty or --

Andrew Schulz: I think they're obsessed with the royal family out there like in general.

Donald Trump: Your mother -- your mother would love that.

Andrew Schulz: She was really into all the pageantry for sure.

Donald Trump: My mother was.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah. I saw --

Donald Trump: My mother thought the queen was great.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: She thought the queen was so wonderful --

Andrew Schulz: Some of my family hates the English, though.

Donald Trump: No, I know.

Andrew Schulz: I won't lie. There's some history there.

Donald Trump: I know, I know, I know but -- but a lot of the -- it's a hard breakup.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: You know, they tried to break up Scotland from --

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: From the rest of the Empire, so to speak.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah. Because they got some oil.

Donald Trump: And it made it by about like a half a point.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: They kept it together. So, I hope it stays together.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: I hope it always stays together. But England, as they say, because it used to be England --

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: But England never could -- they just -- and they were bigger.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And they had more people.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: They could never finish it off by capturing Scotland.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: So it's really sort of --

Andrew Schulz: They ended up having to marry together.

Donald Trump: They -- they married.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: They -- they became sort of subsidiaries, right?

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: But it was great. That's interesting with your mother.

Andrew Schulz: Guys, that little chunk of this scintillating conversation with President Trump has been brought to you by the great company, Stake, partnered with us here on Flagrant. You know, Stake is -- is where you're going to do your gambling. It's where you're going to go do your gambling.

Akaash Singh: You can even gamble on the election. Who do you think is going to win?

Andrew Schulz: You can do that. You can do -- which we would not try to influence in any way, shape, or form, OK? So, you make those judgments on your own. But you can also gamble on sports. Gamble on lots of different things. You can do it over there with Stake. And when you use our promo code, FLAGRANT, you are going to get your signup bonus when you do that.

Andrew Schulz: So, you can go do that right now. We appreciate you tapping in, locking in. And when you do your gamble, you're doing it with our partner, Stake. Thank you so much. Let's get back to the show. OK, so the humor -- so the humor comes from there, maybe some other things, because I think that's one thing that there's bipartisan support for you is even the people that are like, "I don't like that guy. We'll go. Hey, he's funny, though. He says funny things." Have you heard this before about you?

Donald Trump: Yeah, I've heard it.

Andrew Schulz: It's very disarming humor.

Donald Trump: Yeah, but in my business in what I do, if you don't have humor, you won't even survive.

Andrew Schulz: Wait. Why is that? Because I think you have to have -- you have to have a light side. I see a lot of dark things. I see horrible things. I see things that are bad. I see political things that are hard. I mean, we have a lot of corrupt people in this country, and I see it. And horrible corrupt people.

Andrew Schulz: We have people that, you know, I really do. We have -- from the inside, we have really bad people. And outside, we do. But I think the outside is -- I think it's easier to handle China. If you have a smart president who knows, you know, some things, if you had a -- who knows how to deal, let's say -- Yeah.

Donald Trump: You're not going to have a problem with Russia. You're not -- Russia would have never attacked Ukraine if I were president. I used to talk to Putin about it. I got along great with him. They would have never ever done it. I ended his pipeline. You know, I ended the pipeline called Nord Stream 2. Nobody ever heard of Nord Stream 2.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah, yeah. [Inaudible]

Donald Trump: I said -- I said, "Are you building a pipeline going to Europe?" "Yeah." I said, "I don't think so." And I told -- I -- you know, I got them together. I said, "You mean, we're defending you from Russia and you're paying them billions of dollars a month for oil? It's not going to work that way." And I ended it.

Donald Trump: And then, when Biden came in, he gave it back, the biggest project they ever had, right? He gave it back. And then, everyone said, "Trump is friends with Putin." And so, Putin would say, "If you're my friend, I'd hate like hell to see you as my enemy." Think of it. Then, I put a lot of sanctions on -- but I got along with Russia.

Donald Trump: I got along with pretty much everybody. Actually, the tougher they were, the better I did with them. That's a good thing, not a bad thing. Because the other ones are easy to handle. But the ones that I got along with. And they're also the bigger threats. I got along very well with President Xi of China. But when COVID came, I was not happy with him --

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Because it came out of the labs. I mean they released it from -- accidentally, I believe. You know, a lot of people would say it wasn't an accident. But they got hit very hard. They got hit as hard as anybody in the world. It was late, it was belated. It was a late hit.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: But when COVID came, I had -- you know, I made an unbelievable trade deal with China. They have to buy $50 billion of our product every year. It was unbelievable. Nobody could believe I got that deal done. I don't even talk about it because of COVID. I don't even talk about it. That deal is unbelievable.

Donald Trump: And what's happened now, our farmers have been hit because Biden hasn't pressed them to honor the deal.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: You know, I used to -- every day I'd get up, "How much of China buy today?" "Sir, they bought --" I'd call them up, I'd say, "You're behind. You have to buy 50 billion." Do you think Biden does that? Biden's sleeping.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: But I -- the last week, I have -- when we talk about funny or sad, I think it's more sad than funny.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: He has one ability I don't have.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: He sleeps. He can sleep. This guy goes on a beach, and he lays down on one of those, you know, six ounce -- they weigh six ounces, and he can't lift it. They're meant -- they're meant -- they're meant for -- they're meant for children.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Young people.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And old people to lift.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: They're aluminum. You know, hollow aluminum.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Donald Trump: They weigh very little, and he can't lift. And somebody convinced him he looks good in a bathing suit. And when you're 82, typically, bathing suits aren't going to make you look great.

Andrew Schulz: Right. Right.

Donald Trump: You're not going to be enhanced. All right? It's just one of those things. I can't be sure about that. But, yeah, typically, you know --

Andrew Schulz: It depends what he's packing. He could --

Donald Trump: I don't know what the hell he's packing, but I don't want to -- and I don't want to know either. I don't know. But -- but he has an ability to fall asleep while on camera. He can lie down on one of those things --

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And in minutes, he's stone cold out.

Andrew Schulz: How does he do it? How does he --

Donald Trump: And he's got cameras because he's the president so they have cameras on him.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah, yeah.

Donald Trump: And then, they show him sleeping on the beach.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: You'll never see me sleeping in front of the camera.

Andrew Schulz: How do we get you better at that? Like what can we do? How do we work on that as a country?

Donald Trump: As a country?

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: We got to save our country. Look, we are -- we are -- we are a nation in decline, whether you like it or not.

Andrew Schulz: I hate hearing that.

Donald Trump: I know, I hate it.

Andrew Schulz: That hurts me. That hurts me. As a proud American, I --

Donald Trump: Well, what you'll like, though, is -- but we're going to be greater than ever before.

Andrew Schulz: So, that's I think the messaging that I think --

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Andrew Schulz: I think that's really nice to hear.

Donald Trump: Well, that's my ultimate message.

Andrew Schulz: Yes.

Donald Trump: But you can't avoid the fact that we've allowed 21 million people into our country in the last three and a half years. And I don't know your persuasion, I don't know if you guys are liberal or what, but nobody can be happy with 21 million people openly walking into a place we don't know. And it was released last week --

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: That 13,000 of those people are murderers, 13,099. Thirteen thousand of those people are in prison. They're incarcerated for murder, and they let them out.

Andrew Schulz: I think you have support on this, though. I think everybody --

Donald Trump: Tremendous support.

Andrew Schulz: Regardless of their political affiliation.

Donald Trump: I think -- I'll let you know -- I'll let you know on November 6th if I have support, the day after the election.

Andrew Schulz: I don't think -- I don't think there's pushback.

Donald Trump: November 5th, the most important day.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah. I think people are agreeing they want a strong border. And I think --

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Andrew Schulz: I don't think that's an issue that's like tearing the country apart. But I do think that there is something that --

Donald Trump: There are some people that want open, and they're either --

Andrew Schulz: But they're like politicians that are getting some sort of reinforcement through this.

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Andrew Schulz: The average American, I don't think, is going "We need an open border."

Donald Trump: Or they hate our country.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: I think only a person that hates our country, actually, maybe it's a down deep hatred, can want open borders. So, we took in 20 -- more than 21 million people in the last three and a half years. And we have no idea where they even come from. They're terrorists, they're drug dealers, you know, in Venezuela -- and it's not just South America.

Donald Trump: But take Venezuela. They've taken their criminals off the streets of Caracas, which was a very dangerous city. You couldn't walk across the street in Caracas and get a loaf of bread. Right now, it's a -- it's a safe city. Their crime is down 72 percent. They've taken all of their criminals, almost all of them, and they brought them into the United States and dumped them.

Andrew Schulz: Right. Yeah.

Donald Trump: That's not ending well. You know where some of them went? To Aurora, in Colorado, and they took over the town. They took it over.

Andrew Schulz: The whole town?

Donald Trump: Oh, pretty much, yeah. You know how they took it over? With guns. They went into the real estate business. Like me, I had to go to a bank and borrow.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: They went in with --

Andrew Schulz: With guns.

Donald Trump: MK-47. So, they went in with -- they went in with --

Andrew Schulz: Would have been so much easier, yeah.

Donald Trump: Weapons like nobody's ever seen before.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah. But I think most people are on board --

Donald Trump: They went in with military-style weapons, they've taken it over.

Andrew Schulz: But I think most people are on board with -- with deporting any illegal that has committed a crime like --

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Andrew Schulz: I think there's bipartisan support for that. I think the tricky thing comes. And honestly, I have empathy like you're a business owner --

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Andrew Schulz: There's been people -- I'm not trying to out you. But like there's some people I'm sure that might not have had like legal citizenship that have maybe worked in various businesses.

Donald Trump: Yeah, that's true.

Andrew Schulz: And it's like -- you know, I definitely have been taken care of as a kid by people that weren't legal, babysitters and stuff. So, there -- there are people that maybe would like a path to citizenship that I have a lot of empathy for.

Donald Trump: You have to start with the criminals.

Andrew Schulz: I agree.

Donald Trump: OK, look, I have --

Andrew Schulz: But maybe -- but maybe we can --

Donald Trump: It's very tough.

Andrew Schulz: Maybe we can open our hearts a little bit to the people --

Donald Trump: I agree.

Andrew Schulz: Who are trying to be good, hardworking Americans

Donald Trump: And you know what's going to happen? You're going to be in the midst of this. Now, you know Dwight Eisenhower was sort of a moderate, General Eisenhower. Did you know that they had 8 percent generals, president of the United States. Eight percent were generals, 92 percent were politicians, and then you had Trump.

Donald Trump: See, that's a weave. You know, we go off in just [Inaudible]

Andrew Schulz: I like that. Because now, I'm like where are we weaving to. I'm into this.

Donald Trump: No, no, think of it because we're talking about generals, and then you get back onto the general.

Andrew Schulz: There you go.

Donald Trump: Because what I was going to say is that Eisenhower is a moderate.

Andrew Schulz: I like the play by play for the week.

Donald Trump: No, it's good, though. Isn't it great?

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: We're going to -- we mentioned Eisenhower, and then I say he was a general. Eight percent generals, 92 percent. And now, you go back. OK? It's part of the weave.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Then, you go back.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah, yeah.

Donald Trump: You got to keep it all together. You got to be sharp. If you're not sharp, you're dead. Think of it, think of it. No, but think of it. So, we have 92 percent and 8 percent. Nobody -- no admirals.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And no business people until me.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: So, now, we have me. I'm one. Yeah, so I'm --

Andrew Schulz: And then, maybe things change after that. OK, here's --

Donald Trump: No, I think it will change.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: There'll never be another business person that ever does this.

Andrew Schulz: OK, here's a question --

Donald Trump: Because I've been treated so badly that I think that no person of success -- don't forget my whole life was deals, deals, deals, deals, deals, deals.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Most guys are stiffs.

Andrew Schulz: Yes.

Donald Trump: Like they'll run for office.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: There's no deal. There's no -- nothing.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: You can't get yourself in trouble much.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: You can be a crooked politician --

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Which some are.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: But basically, I do so many deals. I do hundreds of thousands of pages of documents a year.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: You know, as I'm -- when I'm really in the mood, right?

Andrew Schulz: Yeah. What about mood?

Donald Trump: And if they find one page, I got myself a problem politically.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Akaash Singh: Yeah.

Donald Trump: OK? Look at it. They went after me for years on taxes.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Years.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: They went to the United States Supreme Court. I gave them tens of thousands of pages, and you never heard about it again.

Andrew Schulz: Well that is what often happens, which is probably incredibly frustrating, which is lobbying an allegation --

Donald Trump: Well, that's the problem.

Andrew Schulz: And then, when it's proven to be false, they just move on [Inaudible]

Donald Trump: Oh, they don't even write about it. I called the New York Times on something, I was right. And the --

Andrew Schulz: The Russian thing was -- was wild.

Donald Trump: Are you going to do -- yeah, the Russian hoax.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Akaash Singh: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Well, I'm suing Pulitzer. You don't know this. They got a Pulitzer Prize for their -- New York --

Andrew Schulz: The hoax?

Donald Trump: Washington Post.

Akaash Singh: Oh, wow. Wow.

Donald Trump: Yeah, for the hoax. They got the Pulitzer Prize, so the writers got Pulitzer Prizes for their brilliant coverage of the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax.

Andrew Schulz: Interesting.

Donald Trump: But it turned out to be right. So --

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: We wrote a letter to the Pulitzer Prize, right?

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: You know, the committee, it's a big foundation.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And we said -- it's a lawsuit that's going on right now.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And we said, "We demand that you take back the Pulitzer Prizes. We demand an apology."

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Because you're actually -- by leaving them, you're -- you know, you're sort of saying it happened, and it didn't happen. Everybody now is giving them --

Andrew Schulz: Yeah, you're rewarding the lie.

Donald Trump: Yeah. So, I sued them. They said, "Well, we did what we did, we're not --"

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: OK. That's OK. That's all right. So, I sued them. And they've got themselves a big problem now.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And this suit is moving along. And I think we're going to win that suit easily.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Because they gave people Pulitzer Prizes that were wrong.

Akaash Singh: Yeah.

Donald Trump: You know who should get the Pulitzer Prizes equivalent, if you could? Guys like Sean Hannity --

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Guys like, you know, that -- there were numerous of them that -- I mean not as many as the fake news as the very liberal media. But we had tremendous, John Solomon, he's a great writer. So many people knew that that was a hoax. They should get prizes. I don't know. Pulitzer Prize, you don't give Pulitzer Prizes to a guy on television.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: You can't get, in theory, a Pulitzer Prize.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: But you had a lot of people that got that right. They got nothing. So, we sued Pulitzer on the basis that they should absolutely take that prize back. And I said, "By not taking it back, you're trying to say that it actually happened," you know, in a way.

Akaash Singh: Yeah.

Donald Trump: I'm saying you're defaming me because by you not taking those prizes back --

Andrew Schulz: I think there's justification.

Donald Trump: You're actually saying it happened.

Andrew Schulz: Let's take a break for a second because some of y'all need to upgrade your wallet. Some of y'all don't. Because last year, you scooped up the Flagrant Ekster wallet, OK? We collab with the best wallet in the business. Why is it the best? Well, not only because they could do that cool thing with all your cards, one, nobody's carrying around cash anymore.

Andrew Schulz: So, what are we even thinking about? You need something to keep your cards, and you need to make sure that you're not going to lose it. How are you going to make sure you're not going to lose it? This thing right here, GPS. If somebody steals it from you, follow that motherfucker back to his house. Call the cops, don't do anything about it, I don't want that liability.

Andrew Schulz: But follow that ass. Also, if you're a thief and you're watching this, don't steal these wallets. You could steal it, but then give it back to them. Like, "Yo, I don't want these problems because you could follow me to my house." We have a new thing. They got the BlueChew pouch, OK? You could put whatever you want in there.

Andrew Schulz: We put hard dick. We put hard dick in your wallet. Don't forget to leave your hard dick at home. The BlueChew pouch inside the new extra wallet is crazy. The last batch sold out immediately. Shout out to every one of the asshole armies that see me in the street and they pulled out that extra wallet. We appreciate you, OK? With that, BlueChew pouch, again, you can put whatever you want in there, OK? Percocets, you can make that dick soft or hard, OK? Xanax, you could put whatever you want in there, OK? But this is the BlueChew pouch.

Andrew Schulz: Right now, the No. 1 rated smart wallet in the world. With the BlueChew pouch, you get to try risk-free for 100 days. For a limited time, you can get 30 percent off your extra Flagrant collab wallet at partner.ekster.com/flagrant with the code FLAGRANT. That is partner.ekster.com/flagrant. Go do it. Let's get back to the show.

Andrew Schulz: All right guys, let's take a break for a second. Hard dicks season is upon us, and you got to make sure that you're stiffed up with the boys or with the girls with whomever you want to be stiffed up with. BlueChew has got your back, OK?

Donald Trump: How are we doing so far? Good?

Andrew Schulz: You're doing great.

Akaash Singh: You're doing amazing. They're making us wrap up. We want you for longer.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah, no, this is great.

Donald Trump: I bet it's my -- I bet it's my people. You know, I do have other things, but --

Andrew Schulz: I know you're busy, but --

Donald Trump: How interesting is this, though?

Andrew Schulz: See this is the fun stuff.

Akaash Singh: Yeah.

Andrew Schulz: Alexx is a good kid.

Donald Trump: He's an influencer.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah, he's a good kid.

Donald Trump: You know, I asked him. I said, "Alexx, let me ask you a question."

Alexx Media: Sure.

Donald Trump: And I didn't -- I wasn't thinking of myself.

Akaash Singh: Oh, you're not, you're not telling him. He's got time now.

Donald Trump: I said, "Who is giving --" give them a little more time, what the hell? Can I override Alexx? I don't know.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Unlike Biden, he can't. I can't -- I can't do it. I can say, Alex, I'm doing it. He said, "Thank you, sir." No, Biden can't. They turned the cameras off with this guy. Did you ever see it? The cameras are off, the lights go off everywhere.

Andrew Schulz: He's still in the room.

Donald Trump: He just -- you'll see he's in deep -- he's in deep trouble. We're in no trouble.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: But I'll tell you what I asked, Alexx. He's an influencer. You know, he's a very --

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: He's a big name influencer. I don't know if he's in this league. I don't know who the hell knows, but I said to him, knowing nothing about influencers, I said, "Who is the biggest of all the influencers?" "Sir, that's the easiest question you've ever asked me." "Who is it?" "You, sir."

Akaash Singh: True.

Andrew Schulz: Wow.

Donald Trump: I never thought of it. He said, "You're the biggest. You have hundreds of millions of people, you have more people than anybody else by far." You know, before they took away -- I went from having 280 million on Facebook and Twitter and Instagram, the three of them combined, 280. I think I was -- I think I was No.

Donald Trump: 1 because Zuckerberg told me that. He came to the White House. He said, "Congratulations. You're No. 1 on Facebook." You know, so I went from that to having nobody. I went -- that was like cold turkey, right? You'd call that cold turkey --

Akaash Singh: Yeah, yeah.

Donald Trump: Like that would be like if we didn't do business with China, one day, I said, "No more business with China," you go cold turkey, right?

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And I went -- and I said, "Boy, but I had a lot to say." This was after the presidency, of course. You know they do it after the presidency --

Akaash Singh: Yeah.

Donald Trump: During the presidency, they're a little bit --

Andrew Schulz: Very nice, yeah.

Donald Trump: But anyway, but they -- I went totally -- totally off. I had nobody. And I had all these ideas. And I couldn't get the word out. And I had some good thoughts. And people wanted to hear my thoughts. And I did a thing called Save America, just to -- and essentially, it was like the old-fashioned -- you guys are far too young.

Donald Trump: In the old days, what we did, we didn't have tweeting and we didn't have Truth. Truth is doing great, by the way. Would you please use Truth? I love Truth. Use Truth, everybody. It's my voice. But I also use X. I also use X. But I went from -- I went from having all these people, and I did an old-fashioned press release.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: It's called -- we used to go to press release.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah, yeah.

Donald Trump: And somebody would write up something --

Andrew Schulz: And send it to all -- yeah.

Donald Trump: I started doing it, Save America. And they get -- they got longer and better and longer, and I started doing it.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And, man, I had millions of people. Now, nobody else could do that because, you know, if somebody puts out a press release --

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: It just doesn't work out too well. But I did it. And it did well. And then, I did Truth. And -- and I'm very good friends with Elon. And we owe Elon a lot for what he's done with X.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And I use X, too. I use X, too. But my voice is on Truth, and it's done really well. I mean, if I want to get something out, I put it on Truth, and everybody picks it up, you know.

Andrew Schulz: That's the thing. You put it there and then you see other people --

Donald Trump: It's picked up all over the place. It's picked up --

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: I mean, I could be on anything I want. But I put it out on Truth, and it just gets picked up all over the place.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: So, it's been very good. But he said I was the No. 1 influencer. See, the weave.

Andrew Schulz: The weave. OK.

Akaash Singh: Yeah, I got you.

Andrew Schulz: Question, question. OK, you've got your son, Barron.

Donald Trump: Do you think I'm the No. 1 influencer?

Akaash Singh: [Inaudible]

Andrew Schulz: I think it's --

Donald Trump: So, who else?

Andrew Schulz: I think it's Rogan -- I think it's Rogan, you, and Kim Kardashian. Like, Kim Kardashian influences the shape of women's bodies and faces. Like you see so many -- they're literal,

Donald Trump: Do they want to look like --

Andrew Schulz: Shape of human beings?

Donald Trump: Do they want to look like her?

Andrew Schulz: They want to look like her. So, once we start seeing dudes want to look like you.

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Andrew Schulz: And I see young Jack over there, I think he's trying to do it. Yeah, you're TikTok guy.

Donald Trump: TikTok Jack.

Andrew Schulz: TikTok Jack. TikTok Jack.

Donald Trump: TikTok -- tell me. You know, this is a little new world. I call him -- his name is Jack. I call him TikTok Jack. I'm good with names, you know.

Andrew Schulz: You are. You are.

Akaash Singh: You're very good with names.

Donald Trump: Pocahontas.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: We have names.

Andrew Schulz: What about -- and there was tampon Tim was good. What about -- does that --

Donald Trump: With tampon Tim, it's hard to say.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: In other words --

Andrew Schulz: It's a mouthful.

Akaash Singh: Yeah.

Donald Trump: It's a lot.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And you can't stutter it through when you call it.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: It's really a lousy word to say.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: But it's quite accurate, right?

Andrew Schulz: OK.

Donald Trump: There are some like comrade Kamala.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: It's a little hard to say.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: She's comrade because she's obviously a communist.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah, OK.

Donald Trump: Yeah, she's horrible.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah, yeah.

Donald Trump: So, I call her comrade.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah, yeah.

Donald Trump: And it's not bad, but when you put the names together --

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: It's a little -- you got to be able to -- you know, you got to be able to put it out there. But we have a lot of good ones. A lot of them I can't go into with you because some of my best ones.

Andrew Schulz: Give me some. Give me some.

Donald Trump: Some of my best ones are from the Republican primaries.

Andrew Schulz: Oh, yeah.

Akaash Singh: Yeah.

Donald Trump: They're all friends of mine now.

Andrew Schulz: You got to be nice.

Donald Trump: So, I've taken --

Andrew Schulz: What about Mike Pence? You got anything for Mike Pence?

Donald Trump: Well, it's a shame because he and I had a very good relationship.

Andrew Schulz: What happened to him?

Akaash Singh: Hanging out somewhere?

Donald Trump: He couldn't cross the line of doing what was right, in my opinion.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Some people would disagree with that. But he had the right to go and put him before the legislatures and have them reassess because they found out a lot of bad things. And he had a lawyer that said he didn't have that right, but he did have that right. And you know why we found out that that was true? Because they changed the law after the election so that he couldn't do what I said he could do.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: OK? They changed the law so that a vice president could no longer do what I said he could do. So, in other words, I turned out to be right. But it's a shame. We had a very good relationship for 99.9 percent of the thing.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And, you know, I think he's a good man. I think he's a good man.

Andrew Schulz: That's good.

Donald Trump: Unfortunately, I wish he would have had the stamina, maybe courage, or maybe both.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: To go further because we have to have honest elections in our country. And if we're afraid to challenge an election, we're in big trouble. You know, they say if you -- they've challenged elections, the Democrats. Look at Maxine Waters, how dare them, you know --

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: They've challenged -- Stacey Abrams.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Almost all of the Democrats challenged.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: But when we challenge, they say, "He's a threat to democracy."

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: These are con artists, and they're very bad for our country.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: So, I'm going to weed them out. We're going to weed them out. I'll do it in honor of you.

Andrew Schulz: OK, so -- so tell me this -- so tell me this, this situation. OK. Barron is 18.

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Andrew Schulz: He's handsome.

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Andrew Schulz: He's tall. Yeah, he's rich.

Donald Trump: He's got the whole ball game.

Andrew Schulz: He's unleashed in New York City. Are you sure you want to reverse Roe v. Wade now? I mean, maybe give him a few years, you know --

Donald Trump: You know, it's up to the states now. It's up to the states.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Because I have -- and I believe in exceptions and all of the different things.

Andrew Schulz: Yes. You've been vocal about that. Will you try to influence?

Donald Trump: I think -- I think a lot of people agree with me.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: You know, I was very, very strong, very, very tough. And Republicans were going to lose a lot of elections having to do with a lot of other things, too, because there are many issues. We have the border --

Akaash Singh: Yeah.

Donald Trump: We have this, we have wars, we have everything.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And Roe v. Wade was always about getting it back to the states.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And then, people started talking about the number of weeks and all these -- but nobody wanted -- no legal scholar, no Democrat, no Republican, liberal conservative, nobody wanted it in the federal government. It shouldn't be in the federal government. And the legal scholars, it was abhorrent. They didn't want it, and they didn't want it in the federal government.

Akaash Singh: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And it was in the federal government.

Akaash Singh: I know you so you said -- sorry.

Donald Trump: What we did is -- right, what we did is we moved it back to the states and the vote of the people. And now, they're voting. Ohio voted a very liberal -- you know, Ohio, I won Ohio by a lot. But they -- they voted, and it's up to them.

Akaash Singh: Yeah.

Donald Trump: OK. I do believe in exceptions, life of the mother and incest.

Andrew Schulz: Right.

Donald Trump: If your daughter is raped by somebody --

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Let's say he's from a prison someplace --

Akaash Singh: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And he's killed people and everything else.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Absolutely, you have to be able to do.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: There are some people -- and I think that group is smaller and smaller when they realize what's going on, but there are some people that, under no circumstances, can you do it.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: I don't happen to agree. Ronald Reagan didn't agree. But what has happened is it's now back in the states where it belongs. And the states are moving along, and they're approving things. So, some -- some conservative and some liberal.

Andrew Schulz: There's a -- there's a -- there are some places -- my wife and I had a baby through IVF.

Donald Trump: Good.

Andrew Schulz: And you've been very supportive of IVF.

Donald Trump: I was totally --

Andrew Schulz: I really loved that. You said that you guys were going to pay for it.

Donald Trump: Right from the beginning.

Andrew Schulz: And I would love to get the refund or whatever once that happens when the government --

Donald Trump: I actually said, "We want babies in our country."

Andrew Schulz: And we do.

Akaash Singh: Yeah.

Andrew Schulz: But so now, there are some people using that reversal of Roe v. Wade to kind of attack the legality of IVF. And to me, it's like that's heartbreaking.

Donald Trump: These are crooked politicians. These are politicians -- now, I'll give you an example. I came out -- when it first came up and it started in Alabama where a judge ruled that you couldn't do IVF and all clinics, all over Alabama was going to shut down, we're going to be shut down. And I wasn't an expert on IVF, but I have common sense. You know, we're the party of common sense.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And some women called me and actually Katie Britt called me, the senator from Alabama, who's really a young good politician, smart, great husband who was a football player, great family. She called me up. She said, "Sir, women have come to me and almost attacked me, and they're my best friends, that the judge shut down IVF. He was a very, you know, conservative judge and he shut down IVF."

Donald Trump: And I said, "Let's explain it. Tell me." And she told me. I said, "No, it's a great thing. It's helping women have babies." And she didn't know her friends were all going through IVF. She didn't know it.

Andrew Schulz: It's so much more common than people realize. Yeah.

Donald Trump: But they don't talk about it, you know, let's say somebody, I mean --

Andrew Schulz: [Inaudible] quite comfortable, yeah.

Donald Trump: I understand. Nobody -- I never had big discussions. I know this. If you're a woman and you're going through -- you're not going to be telling Katie Britt --

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And you're not going to be telling your friends, "Hey, I'm going through IVF."

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Some will and some won't.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: But she didn't know anything about her friends. And they were good friends of hers. She said, "They're literally attacking me."

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: I said, "Well, what is it --" after about five minutes, I'm a quick study, I said that's a great thing.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And I came out -- within 45 minutes of the decision, I came out strongly in favor on behalf of the Republican Party. And I have calls from senators saying, "Thank you, sir. You saved my political career."

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Akaash Singh: Wow.

Donald Trump: Because they might have come out --

Andrew Schulz: You saved their family, too.

Donald Trump: But here's what does happen, which is really -- we get calls that -- just the other day that this total lying politician that's running -- that ruined San Francisco, she destroyed San Francisco with her very liberal policies, and she destroyed the state of --

Andrew Schulz: Gavin Newsom.

Donald Trump: No, it's her. But Gavin Newsom, I call him Gavin New-scum. Gavin --

Andrew Schulz: That's a good one. Good.

Donald Trump: No, he's a terrible -- he's a terrible.

Andrew Schulz: That was -- that was --

Donald Trump: No. He -- Gavin Newsom, he doesn't like that name. But he is --

Andrew Schulz: Good hair, though.

Donald Trump: Gavin -- he probably does, yeah.

Mark Gagnon: Yeah, he has nice --

Donald Trump: I don't know, he is?

Mark Gagnon: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Donald Trump: I don't know.

Alexx Media: Pretty good [Inaudible]

Donald Trump: Well, don't -- don't take your hat off. You never know. Sometimes, the guy will take his hat off, he has good hair. I say, "Boy, you were right." And usually, it's bald. No, 95 percent of the time. There's always a reason -- you know, usually a reason. And that's OK, too. But -- but -- but what I do, I get a call, and they say that she, Kamala, said that I'm against IVF, OK, that I'm against it. They know it's untrue. But all of the lies --

Andrew Schulz: Positioning in a way, yeah.

Donald Trump: So many different things. The bloodbath, that was about the auto industry. But the word is a tough word. China is going to take all our auto business if we go all electric and all this stuff.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And the head of the union, I said, is a fool. He sold the union down. I'm doing great with the -- you notice the Teamsters like me, and they all like me. The workers like me.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Because I'm going to --

Andrew Schulz: It seems to be that way always. Yeah.

Donald Trump: Yeah, see the -- even -- even union -- unions that have never been with a Republican before are endorsing me.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: I mean, it's incredible. The Teamsters voted 61 percent in favor of Trump. Think of that.

Andrew Schulz: Wow.

Donald Trump: The -- I'll tell you the FBI would be in -- almost everybody. I think almost everybody would be in favor.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: But they lie, and they say -- and they know it's a lie. Charlottesville, the Charlottesville statement was perfect. If they take the next sentence that I gave -- I made a statement on it. It was a perfect statement. And if you take -- but they never take the next sentence, they cut it off.

Andrew Schulz: And then, there's no accountability.

Donald Trump: Even the other one, patriot -- peacefully and patriotically in my speech.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: I talked about peacefully and patriotically. They never showed that. They never talk about it. To show you how dishonest they are, the J6 committee -- I call it the unselect, you know, they call it the Select Committee, I call it the Unselect Committee of political hacks and thugs. They never talk about my speech --

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Because it was a good speech. It was a -- you know, patriotic speech.

Andrew Schulz: Are you numb to this now or --

Donald Trump: No, I never get numb.

Andrew Schulz: Does it still bother you?

Donald Trump: It bothers me. I'll tell you what bothers me. Kamala, the other day, said, "He is against IVF." And everybody knows that that's false.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: When I came out, people were a little surprised actually because, you know, in theory, but I came out strongly in favor of IVF. She is an add-on that I'm against IVF. She knows it's untrue. She has an add-on that bloodbath. Bloodbath means like blood, and that's not what I was talking about. The automobile industry.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: It's going to be a bloodbath in the automobile. We're going to lose all our business.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: That's what I was referring to. When they do things -- and they do a lot. But I always refer them back to the simplicity of McDonald's. She lied about McDonald's, she lied about many things, and she's a liar. There should be some kind of a rule when they know it's a lie, you can't do a commercial on it.

Donald Trump: But this is a thing that's going to end in 29 days so they can say what they want -- I have a hard time doing it to them because I'm -- you know, I'm basically a truthful person, but -- and frankly --

Andrew Schulz: What does that mean?

Donald Trump: No, but practically --

Andrew Schulz: What does that mean?

Akaash Singh: What's basically?

Donald Trump: No, but frankly -- no, but frankly, she's given me so much ammunition. I don't really have to. I mean she's a radical left lunatic who will destroy our nation other than that.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: But she will destroy our nation. So, when you take a look at it, and I think that -- you know just getting back to your original thought on the abortion, having it back in the states, the people are now voting on it. And we're going to put an end to a 52-year ordeal. This has been going on for 52 years.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: It's back with the states, and it's a vote of the people.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And that's where everybody wanted it to be. And I think that issue is largely quelled because of that.

Akaash Singh: You've said like Arizona, you think, went a little bit too far. If you feel the state goes a little bit too far, will you use a little influence and say, "Hey, maybe [Inaudible] we can make exceptions?

Donald Trump: I would. Oh, no, I won't back it. I won't back it.

Akaash Singh: OK. OK.

Donald Trump: I think you --

Akaash Singh: I think that's important for moderates to hear. That's what I want to give you the opportunity to say it.

Donald Trump: No, no, I won't back it. No, some states say, no --

Andrew Schulz: [Inaudible] here. Yeah.

Akaash Singh: Yeah.

Donald Trump: But they're all changing because the people in the state won't stand for that. There are some states that say, under no circumstances, you have a daughter, and she's raped by the worst, most violent criminal in the country, and you cannot get, you know, her --

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: She -- you cannot take her and --

Andrew Schulz: She has to live with that for the rest of her life. Yeah.

Akaash Singh: Yeah.

Donald Trump: She's got to live with this.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And you know the father is a monster. He's from an insane asylum because he killed 50 people.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And you're going to have that baby. Yeah, and I can't believe --

Andrew Schulz: You have an empathy for that?

Donald Trump: No, no, I can't believe that people are forced to do that.

Akaash Singh: Yes.

Donald Trump: And you have a tiny -- you know, right now, it was -- it used to be a much bigger segment.

Akaash Singh: Yeah.

Donald Trump: No, I think I've done a good job in a lot of ways because I've convinced people that you just can't do that.

Akaash Singh: No, that's important.

Donald Trump: It's always been complex. It's always been tough. But we've come a long way with that issue. But just in a nutshell, bringing it back to the states and giving a vote of the people is where they wanted it 30 years ago, 20 years ago, 10 years ago. And then, they got a little complex. They talked about the length and the, you know, the number of weeks.

Akaash Singh: Yeah.

Andrew Schulz: With protections -- with protections for women.

Donald Trump: To me, to Ronald Reagan a long time ago was with the same three protections.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: He said he wanted, you know, for rape, incest, and the life of the mother. And that was a long time ago

Andrew Schulz: OK. You have a very busy day. Before you go, what would you like your legacy to be and what do you think it will be?

Donald Trump: So --

Andrew Schulz: And thank you very much for taking time.

Donald Trump: Two very different questions actually, I think, but --

Andrew Schulz: What would you like it to be?

Donald Trump: I took over a country that was very troubled. This country was broken up and a tremendous dissension, and Barack Obama started it. And if you take a look, it was very, very badly broken. And I think now, with -- with Biden, you know, let's forget her for a second, but with Biden and her, part of it, big part of it -- but with Biden, there's tremendous dissension.

Donald Trump: The country is a broken-up mess, and it's broken in a lot of ways. But what I would like my legacy to be is the same as the term MAGA, Make America Great Again. I'm going to make this country great again. It's not a great country right now. It's loaded up.

Andrew Schulz: It's always a great country.

Alexx Media: It's a great country.

Donald Trump: See --

Andrew Schulz: It's always a great country.

Donald Trump: OK, but I say it has the potential, and it was a great country. I think now, there's so much hatred and there's so much dissension. I think when you have people that can't walk down Fifth Avenue, when you have people that can't walk down the street, it ceases to be --

Andrew Schulz: We can only be better. We can only be better.

Donald Trump: Yeah, but you can't blindfold yourself to say -- yeah.

Andrew Schulz: No, I'm honest about it. But to me, I'm really proud of America because I think that I don't -- I think I can be the best version of myself here. You know, I think that Donald Trump can only happen in America. Your life, what has happened to you, this is an American story.

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Andrew Schulz: My mom's life is an American story. Like, my mom's from Scotland, she comes here and has all the success. And she's so grateful of what America is. That doesn't mean that we can't make it better. I like the idea of making it better every single time, fixing these things when there's leaks in the ship.

Andrew Schulz: But the idea of America and becoming the greatest version of yourself is something I'll always be proud of. And I like -- yeah.

Donald Trump: So, I understand what you're saying. When -- when I was president, we had no wars in the whole world because of me. I stopped a lot of wars from happening.

Andrew Schulz: That makes me proud, right, But it's just not happening now. Yeah.

Donald Trump: Right now, people are dying in Ukraine --

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Because we had an incompetent president. If we had a president that knew what the hell he was doing, Ukraine would have never happened. Israel would have never happened.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: All those people that are dying on both sides --

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: That would have never happened. Afghanistan, people falling off airplanes from -- think of that --

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: From 3,500 feet above the ground, three times the height of the Empire State Building off the side of the airplane.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: All of this horrible stuff would have never happened. Inflation would have never happened because that was caused by energy --

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And the stupid energy bill. So, look, we love our country.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And it's had moments of greatness. But it's -- I think it's -- I think it's a very -- it's a -- it's a declining -- it's so sad what's happened. We're a nation in decline, and we can't let it be declined. I'll give you an example. We're going to lose our monetary base very soon because, you know, countries are going off the dollar.

Donald Trump: I'm going to get them back on the dollar. I'm going to say, "You got to go back on -- you're not going to do any business with --" you know, you got to do it. But I do think this, where I really agree with you, we have tremendous potential.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And I say it, make America great again.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And I just want to -- I would like to have it. I used to have something -- I was going to use it and I didn't use it because the country started to do badly, KAG. Not MAGA, KAG. I never liked the word KAG, but it was Keep America Great, you like that better.

Andrew Schulz: I like this.

Donald Trump: But see I couldn't use it because we had so many problems. So once --

Andrew Schulz: Yeah. Also, it sounds like that other word

Donald Trump: It doesn't work as well. Look, there's never going to be another MAGA. I don't know. I came up with a phrase that just turned out to be MAGA.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah, yeah.

Donald Trump: No, it's the greatest movement -- political movement in the history of our country.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And these are people that really love our country, and they want it to be great. And we're going to make it great again.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: That was what I would like to do is make this country so great, better than what you're even thinking. And you are --

Andrew Schulz: I love that.

Donald Trump: I mean, I love your attitude --

Andrew Schulz: I love that.

Donald Trump: Because I think that's the way you should be.

Andrew Schulz: I think that's -- yeah.

Akaash Singh: Sorry. There's one thing -- I want to give you a rumor I'd like to give you a chance to dispel. And then one question, if you have time, I'd like to ask selfishly. Rumor, the far left, I think, says this thing that, "Oh, if Donald Trump wins, he's never going to cede power." And they have some clip of you saying just vote for me one time, you won't have to vote again.

Akaash Singh: I don't believe this is true. I want to give you a chance to --

Donald Trump: You're right.

Akaash Singh: Publicly say that's nonsense, just so you can publicly speak any moderates out there.

Donald Trump: So, what I said -- yeah, Christians tend to vote at a very low percentage for some reason. And so do gun owners, would you believe that? The NRA gun owners tend not to vote?

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Maybe it's a rebellious thing. I don't know.

Akaash Singh: Maybe

Donald Trump: I said, "Look, our country is in big trouble, really big trouble with the border with all the problems. We can solve the problem. But vote this one time, after that, we're not going to need it."

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: This is the most important election in the history of our country vote for this most important election. And then, if you don't want to vote, we're going to have elections. But you don't have to vote because it's going to go along swimmingly.

Andrew Schulz: That's how I interpreted it.

Akaash Singh: OK. Yeah. Yeah. And [Inaudible] chance to --

Donald Trump: That's how they interpreted it to.

Akaash Singh: Yes. Yes.

Andrew Schulz: They know what you're saying.

Donald Trump: It's you've got to vote this time because we don't have -- we can't wait four years. Because you know what, in another four years, like we've just had with this clown that's a president, that's just a clown, a foolish man. Don't forget, he was a stupid man 25 years ago. He was never a smart man. He's run many times.

Donald Trump: He was -- isn't it amazing? He's run many times, and he gets it when he's in serious decline, OK?

Andrew Schulz: OK.

Donald Trump: But anyway, so everybody knows that, and that's what I meant by it.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: It means we got to fix it.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And then, it's going to work beautifully.

Akaash Singh: OK.

Donald Trump: It's going to run beautifully. We're going to have elections every two years and every four years it's going to be great.

Akaash Singh: I just want to give you a chance to say that to moderates.

Donald Trump: And what was your second question?

Akaash Singh: And if I could ask one question. Everybody I speak to, every race, creed, whatever, they don't just like you, they love you. And I talk to people on both sides about your policies. And a lot of people that like your policies, the China tariff that's still in place right now is an example of policy that people love.

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Akaash Singh: I think, sometimes, what we love about you as comedians is you shoot from the hip. But then, that gets twisted into this rhetoric --

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Akaash Singh: That adds gasoline onto everything. So, the one thing I would like is I think a moderate person is maybe, if you get elected, would you be a little bit more mindful of how powerful your words are for better and for worse?

Donald Trump: I will, and I'm going to think of you every time I --

Akaash Singh: Let's go. I'm going to -- I might actually vote.

Donald Trump: No, no, it's true. I mean, I understand that. Sometimes, they say, "Oh, could you be a little bit more --" But you're doing a lot of things --

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And you're solving a lot of problems.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: I stopped wars that nobody will ever know about, they won't write about countries that were fighting each other and didn't affect us much, but they did business with us. I called up two countries that have fought themselves, fought for thousands of years --

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Killing each other for years. And I said, "You guys are at it again." I heard it was going to start up. I stopped it when I first came in. And I said, "Listen, here's the story. If you go to war with each other --" I could give you the details, but I don't even want to bother because it's nice now. I said, "You're not going to do any more business with the United States. I'm going to cut you off 100 percent. And if you do get through, I'm going to charge you 200 percent tariffs. You won't be able to survive. So, work it out, work it out. You know, it was a country that split, and they've been fighting for years."

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: The two halves were, I think, like thousands -- I get a call -- and I forget about it, but I had a rough call with them. And I said, "I'm going to charge you tariffs, and I'm going to -- you're not going to do -- you're going to be cut off. No more business." And if they don't have the United States, it's a problem.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And we have to keep it that way. We have to keep our country strong so we can do this.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah. Leverage, right?

Donald Trump: I mean, if our country was weak, we don't have that.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: You know, if we keep getting weaker and weaker, which is happening, we're not going to let that happen. So, I get a call two weeks later -- two days later. "Sir, we've worked it all out." "Thank you very much." And I go about my business. I save thousands of lives, hundreds of thousands of lives.

Andrew Schulz: [Inaudible]

Donald Trump: They've been killing each other for years, for centuries, and I saved thousands of lives. And nobody writes about it. Many people don't even know that's the reason, you know, things are good. And I had it out with him. I said, "You guys are crazy. You do that, no more doing business with the United States. You cut off 100 percent, you're dead. You're not going to do 10 cents worth of business."

Donald Trump: And I even said the tariff thing. But the first was actually even more powerful. And that's it. I forget about it. I go about doing my business. Two days later, they said, "Congratulations." "What -- on what?" "So and so and so and so is not going to have a war. They made peace." I've done so many things like that, and none of them --

Andrew Schulz: Hit the news cycle. None of them are noticed. Yeah.

Donald Trump: Most of them aren't really known. You know, I've made -- I've made countries do things for us because they were treating us unfairly. And I've gotten things for our country that nobody else -- I really think nobody else could have done. But I enjoy doing it for our country. And, you know, just to get back to where you originally started, I want to make America great again.

Donald Trump: I want to make it so great that people won't question it, so that people can say what you just said --

Andrew Schulz: Yeah.

Donald Trump: That, "No, no, it's great." I don't want to have a question why should I or anybody else say no, it's not great anymore.

Andrew Schulz: Yeah, yeah.

Donald Trump: I don't want to be in that position. I think -- I want to make it so that when you ask a question like that, we can just say, "Well, it's a great, great country." We love our country, but we can do a couple of little things.

Andrew Schulz: I think we need that.

Donald Trump: I'll put that in our -- we want to put that --

Akaash Singh: I love that

Andrew Schulz: I love that. And well, first of all, thank you so much.

Akaash Singh: This is an honor.

Andrew Schulz: I would be remiss to not even bring this up. You've said that you want to have peace in these places, not just Russia and Ukraine. It's obviously in the Middle East.

Donald Trump: Yeah, I do.

Andrew Schulz: I know that is a very tough task. I don't think maybe you get enough credit for what you accomplished in your administration, accomplished with the Abraham Accords.

Donald Trump: The Abraham Accords, and they did nothing. Yeah, again, Iran was willing to do a deal. I would have had a deal with Iran. And within seven days after the election, I actually said, "Let's delay it until after the election because I was sure we were going to win the election." But things happened. You know, COVID happened.

Andrew Schulz: Of course, there was a lot of things going on.

Donald Trump: Look, it was a mess.

Andrew Schulz: But still, I think it's something that a diplomacy out in that region that hasn't existed prior is that something I would imagine --

Donald Trump: Exactly.

Andrew Schulz: That would be at the forefront of this --

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Andrew Schulz: Next administration.

Donald Trump: You know, there are great philosophers that said the world will end in the Middle East. We're not going to let that happen. You've heard that expression.

Akaash Singh: Yeah.

Donald Trump: They said the world will end someday in the Middle East. We're not going to let that happen. OK?

Akaash Singh: Yeah. Thank you. Awesome.

Andrew Schulz: Well, listen, thank you so much.

Donald Trump: Thank you.

Andrew Schulz: Thank you so much, Mr. President. I really appreciate it. Guys.

Alexx Media: Thank you.

Donald Trump: Thank you very much.

Akaash Singh: Thank you so much.

Andrew Schulz: That was awesome.
