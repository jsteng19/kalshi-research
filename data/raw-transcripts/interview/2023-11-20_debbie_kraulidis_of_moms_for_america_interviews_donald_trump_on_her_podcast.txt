Debbie Kraulidis: I'm Debbie with "Moms for America."

Donald Trump: How are you? Nice to see you.

Debbie Kraulidis: Nice to meet -- nice to see you.

Donald Trump: Hello, everybody.

Debbie Kraulidis: Thank you so much, Mr. President --

Donald Trump: Thank you.

Debbie Kraulidis: For meeting with the "Moms for America" podcast here.

Donald Trump: Right.

Debbie Kraulidis: We're just thrilled to be here. So, thanks. I know how busy you are, and you're really so special to us.

Donald Trump: Thank you very much.

Debbie Kraulidis: So, let's get into this here. You spoke at the March for Life, and you talked about how moms were heroes. And the crowd went wild. Why are moms heroes to you?

Donald Trump: Because they do everything. They are so incredible. You look at -- I hate to use the word statistics. But statistically, you have a great mom, you have a great young woman or young man. It just works out that way. And dads are very important also.

Debbie Kraulidis: Right.

Donald Trump: But that mom is so special and taking people that really would have had a rough time and made them super --

Debbie Kraulidis: Yeah.

Donald Trump: made them tremendously successful. The love, whatever it is, there's a lot of ingredients. You know, moms do a lot of things that people don't think about, and maybe it's the little things that count but very special. My mom was very special, very special people.

Debbie Kraulidis: Did your mom ever think that you would become president of the United States? I've always wanted to ask that question to you.

Donald Trump: Probably not, but, you know, every once in a while, she'd say, "Oh, you should do that." But, no, I don't think so. But she was a great mom, very loving mom, a very good person.

Debbie Kraulidis: One of our other favorite moms is Melania. How is Melania?

Donald Trump: She's great. She's doing a tremendous job with my son, who's a fantastic guy.

Debbie Kraulidis: Yes.

Donald Trump: Yeah, he's a good tall guy, too. Very tall.

Debbie Kraulidis: How tall is he now?

Donald Trump: I'd say 6-8.

Debbie Kraulidis: Oh, my goodness.

Donald Trump: So, he's up there, right?

Debbie Kraulidis: Yes.

Donald Trump: But he's a great -- he's a great young man. And he's a very good student. And I think he's doing a good job, Barron. He's -- I think he's doing a very good job.

Debbie Kraulidis: He's 17 now, Barron, right?

Donald Trump: Yes.

Debbie Kraulidis: OK. So, at 4-years-old, there's that CNN interview with him. And it was the cutest thing ever because you said to him, "Listen, no drugs." Right?

Donald Trump: Right.

Debbie Kraulidis: No alcohol, no cigarettes, straight As, no tattoos. Are those words the advice that you're still sharing with your grandchildren now?

Donald Trump: Well, I do, I do. And the tattoos, I think, are in a little different category. You know, you have people personal preferences. That's their preference.

Debbie Kraulidis: Right.

Donald Trump: But no drugs and no cigarettes. And it's just in the old days, I had a brother who was a fantastic guy. He always looked -- he'd look at me and say, "No drugs, no alcohol, no cigarettes." But actually, the drugs was much later really because if you look at drugs today, it's like, today, so much is drugs, less is alcohol.

Donald Trump: Cigarettes, I always add in. It's not a positive thing.

Debbie Kraulidis: Right.

Donald Trump: And if they can avoid it, they'll be -- that's a great thing. But I would tell my kids before, they'd -- I'd see them every day, I'd say, "No drugs, no alcohol, no cigarettes."

Debbie Kraulidis: Yeah, it's important.

Donald Trump: And Ivanka would say sometimes, "Dad, I know. I know what you're going to say, Dad. Please don't say it." And I think it had an impact.

Debbie Kraulidis: Oh, absolutely, absolutely. Look at your kids. They're stellar, amazing.

Donald Trump: When you have one of your children or your children on drugs, it just puts them at such a disadvantage.

Debbie Kraulidis: Right.

Donald Trump: So, you got to keep them away. And it's much easier to keep them away. Once they get hooked, that's a whole different ball game. But when you preach to them before they get addicted --

Debbie Kraulidis: Right.

Donald Trump: Because that's what it is. It's an unbelievable chemical addiction and mental addiction and everything else, you can -- it's just so much easier. If they don't start, it's so much easier.

Debbie Kraulidis: Right. That's it. And you're doing such a great job, and you always have -- concerned with the fentanyl and the drugs coming across the border. Thank you for what you've done to make our country great. And, unfortunately, now, it's all being reversed.

Donald Trump: Now, it's been reversed at a level that nobody's ever seen. People are flowing in, drug dealers are flowing in. I was working on a deal that would have happened very quickly with China. They were not going to make it. They were going to make it part of the death penalty if they make it in China and put it here.

Donald Trump: Once I was out, nobody ever picked that up. Most of it -- the fentanyl is made in China.

Debbie Kraulidis: Right.

Donald Trump: But you have other drugs coming in, too. And we had the border the strongest it's ever been. Now, it's the weakest it's ever been.

Debbie Kraulidis: It's terrible.

Donald Trump: In three years. It's gone from being the strongest -- we have the strongest border we've ever had, human trafficking, largely women. I mean, you talk about moms, I mean, human trafficking, what's worse? And it's mostly women. And we had that to the lowest point it was in 51 years. We had everything really in great shape in this country. And now, it's just so sad to see.

Debbie Kraulidis: Yeah. Let's talk about education, too, right? Fifty million students are in public education system.

Donald Trump: Right.

Debbie Kraulidis: They have become indoctrination centers, and they are filled with inappropriate materials. What would you help us with education?

Donald Trump: Well, we're going to end that. And these indoctrination programs are out of control.

Debbie Kraulidis: Right.

Donald Trump: And we're ending it. It's just like, you know, men in women's sports and the sexual mutilation of children. Who would think that we'd have to talk about sexual mutilation of children? If you go back 10 or 15 years, and somebody said that, you wouldn't even know what they're talking about. And now, it's actually a point in a campaign where you have to talk about it.

Donald Trump: And many people on the other side think it's OK. I mean, we're not talking for our health. People think it's OK. The sexual mutilation of children, think of it. We actually have to put that down as a talking point.

Debbie Kraulidis: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Or men will not be playing in women's sports. We have to put that down as talking point.

Debbie Kraulidis: Right.

Donald Trump: Who would ever think you'd allow men to play in women's sports?

Debbie Kraulidis: No.

Donald Trump: So, the world has gone crazy, but this country has gone crazy.

Debbie Kraulidis: It sure has. And those are two huge issues that the moms are talking about all the time.

Donald Trump: Yeah, yeah.

Debbie Kraulidis: Gender confusion, right? It's -- like you said, is at an all-time high.

Donald Trump: Right.

Debbie Kraulidis: So, thank you so much that you're going to help protect our children because it is horrific.

Donald Trump: And we'll do it fast, too. We'll sign orders left and right. We'll do it fast. It's gone totally out of control.

Debbie Kraulidis: Yes.

Donald Trump: And what I don't understand, who could -- who could think this is good?

Debbie Kraulidis: No one.

Donald Trump: Who could think -- unless you're trying to destroy our country, who could think this is good?

Debbie Kraulidis: Parental rights really go on hand in hand with this. Moms are so concerned about their parental rights, right? They go to a school board meeting, there are domestic terrorists.

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Debbie Kraulidis: If they're -- they don't agree with something, then all of a sudden their children may be taken away. How will you protect parental rights?

Donald Trump: So, that's the third category. You talk about parental rights.

Debbie Kraulidis: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Who wouldn't think that, like, you have parental rights -- we are with you for parental rights.

Debbie Kraulidis: Right.

Donald Trump: Again, 10 years ago, 15 years ago, you wouldn't have to talk about that. Of course, you have parental rights. Today, they take away your parental rights.

Debbie Kraulidis: Yeah.

Donald Trump: And I think the Republicans are going to do very well in this coming election. If we don't do -- if we don't win the election, the presidential election of 2024, it's going to be the most important election in the history of our country, I think our country is going to be essentially finished.

Debbie Kraulidis: That's what we're -- that's what we're hearing all across the country. The moms are -- I hate to say this, we're terrified.

Donald Trump: They have to vote. They have to vote for Trump. Look the Republicans talk in terms of religion. They're going after the Catholic Church. They're going after protestants, they're going after evangelicals. They're going after so many groups. It's not even possible to think this way. And then, you'll have Catholics, as an example, where they're really -- something happened.

Donald Trump: I'm saying, what did they do wrong? But they're going after Catholics at a level that nobody's seen before in this country. Now, why would a Catholic vote for a guy like Biden? It doesn't make sense. But I think we're going to win. And if we don't win, big trouble.

Debbie Kraulidis: I think you're going to win, too. Mandates and the COVID vaccine mandates --

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Debbie Kraulidis: They're back in discussion now. What would -- what would that be under your administration? You'll -- you'll protect us, I know, with those mandates.

Donald Trump: Yes, absolutely. And the mandates are gone and the mask mandates are gone. All of the mandates are gone. It's got to be a choice. You have to have choice. Some people want to do this. They want to take -- they want to take the vaccine, and other people don't.

Debbie Kraulidis: Right.

Donald Trump: And you have to have choice and feeding it to children where they don't need it anywhere near the extent, but really, essentially, they don't need it is absolutely crazy. So, the mandates are gone. There'll be no mandates. You know, we let governors make those decisions --

Debbie Kraulidis: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Which is the federalist system, which is the way it should be. And a lot of Republican governors got it right. They didn't do the big closures. And if it was closed, it was closed for a much lesser period of time. South Carolina was great, and South Dakota was great.

Debbie Kraulidis: Sure.

Donald Trump: And some of the states were absolutely great. And some didn't do as well. The ones that did really poorly though were the Democrat-run states. They were -- they shut down everything. And their numbers were the same or worse --

Debbie Kraulidis: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Which is sort of -- you would think that wouldn't be possible, actually. They would have a shutdown that was incredible, and their numbers were worse. So, no, some of our Republican governors did a fantastic job.

Debbie Kraulidis: Yeah. The economy, moms are figuring out what to do. Can they buy a gallon of milk or a gallon of gas?

Donald Trump: Yeah, yeah.

Debbie Kraulidis: I mean --

Donald Trump: Pretty bad.

Debbie Kraulidis: It is so bad.

Donald Trump: So, we're going to be --

Debbie Kraulidis: It's incredible. I'm going shopping my -- my -- my grocery bill is tripled.

Donald Trump: Yup. We're going to be drilling like you haven't seen before. We're going to get the energy down. When the energy comes down, everything else is going to -- it's such a big category.

Debbie Kraulidis: Yeah.

Donald Trump: That's what started the inflation. Inflation is a country buster. It breaks up countries, it's -- you go back 200 years, 300 years, and you take a look, inflation is a country buster. And we had the worst inflation in 72 years. And what we're doing is we'll be getting the energy prices way down. Everything else is going to follow.

Donald Trump: Interest rates are going to follow. You'll be able to buy a house again. A lot of good things are going to happen. Food prices will start coming down, too. And, you know, when they say, "Oh, gee, we only have 4 or 5 percent inflation now," first of all, they're not adding certain categories to that. But most importantly, when you take a look at what they're saying and what they're doing, everything is the opposite of what it should be. Every single thing they do is the opposite.

Debbie Kraulidis: Yeah.

Donald Trump: So, we're going to get the energy costs down. Other things are going to follow, and interest rates very importantly will follow.

Debbie Kraulidis: What about family? You talk a lot about the importance of family? How important it is to you? How can we restore our families again?

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Debbie Kraulidis: Give them hope. America is built on the family unit.

Donald Trump: Yeah, family and God.

Debbie Kraulidis: Yeah.

Donald Trump: OK, you take a look at religion where it's just not -- COVID, I think, probably hurt it badly, but it's just not --

Debbie Kraulidis: Yeah.

Donald Trump: What it was. When people have that feeling of God --

Debbie Kraulidis: Yes.

Donald Trump: They want God in their lives, it just works out a lot better.

Debbie Kraulidis: It is. It really is.

Donald Trump: It also works out better for a country.

Debbie Kraulidis: Right. Faith, family, and freedom, that's it.

Donald Trump: It's true, it's true. No, families are very important things. You people do a great job. I mean --

Debbie Kraulidis: Thank you.

Donald Trump: It's -- it's really what you've done is amazing.

Debbie Kraulidis: How do you do this? How -- where do you draw your strength from? We're talking about faith. Where do you -- how do you do this every day? How do you get up and fight for every single one of us?

Donald Trump: It's probably the biggest question I get. The second biggest would be they're not going to be allowed to do it again, OK? You know what that means, OK? That's number two. But No. 1 is how do you do it? One of the reasons is that I have the highest poll numbers people have virtually ever seen. You're beating these people by 60 points, and we're beating Biden by a lot.

Donald Trump: And that gives us hope because if we take over the country from the standpoint of winning the election of 2024, it's all going to be OK. We're going to make it not only make America great again, we're going to make it better than ever before. And we're going to get rid of the horrible people, some of these people from prisons, from mental institutions.

Donald Trump: They're coming in from prisons, mental institutions and many terrorists. We're going to get them out. It's going to be a mass deportation and get them out. And we're getting them back to their countries where they came from, many of them right out of jails and prisons.

Debbie Kraulidis: Yeah.

Donald Trump: So, if we win this election, which we have to -- I don't think we have a choice --

Debbie Kraulidis: Right.

Donald Trump: We're going to make our country great again and maybe better than ever before.

Debbie Kraulidis: And safety is another huge issue for moms.

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Debbie Kraulidis: We are -- we're just -- it's -- it's troubling times to raise a family.

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Debbie Kraulidis: Would you just share some words of encouragement to our moms, some hope? Because I know that you're talking about saving America.

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Debbie Kraulidis: And we need to hear from you, um some great encouraging words because we need it.

Donald Trump: If you're in a good system --

Debbie Kraulidis: Yeah.

Donald Trump: If we get what we're getting, where we have proper people coming into our country legally; if we get the prisoners and the people, murderers, drug dealers pouring into our country, we get them out, our system is good. The chances of a mom being successful are much greater. And it's -- it's -- it's much easier.

Donald Trump: Otherwise, it's a very difficult thing for a mom if we're in a bad system.

Debbie Kraulidis: Right.

Donald Trump: And that system is turning very bad right now with Biden and these people. It's turning Marxist and fascist and communist. It's a horrible system. They go after political opponents, all of the things they do. But when we get it going, it's going to make it a lot easier for moms. And that's what I want to do.

Debbie Kraulidis: Well, thank you, President Trump. We -- blessings to you, and thank you for taking time with the "Moms for America" podcast. We do appreciate you.

Donald Trump: Thank you very much.

Debbie Kraulidis: God bless.

Donald Trump: Great honor. Thank you.

Debbie Kraulidis: Thank you.
