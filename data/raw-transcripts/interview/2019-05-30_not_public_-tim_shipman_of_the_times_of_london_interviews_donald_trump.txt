Note: [The Times (UK) published excerpts of its interview with Donald Trump at The White House prior to his trip to the United Kingdom and France. These excerpts are available online.]

Note: [Neither Tim Shipman nor The Times' public relations department replied to repeated emails requesting that the transcript of the interview be published.]

Note: [Because The Times hgas the full interview, but has elected not to publish it in full, our editorial policy is to exclude it from the index. This is not a reflection on The Times but rather a reflection of our focus to be able to present interviews in their full context.]
