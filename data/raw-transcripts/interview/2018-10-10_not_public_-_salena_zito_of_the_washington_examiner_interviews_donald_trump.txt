Note: [Salena Zito conducted an interview with Donald Trump on October 10, 2018 in Erie, Pennsylvania. Zito has published pieces of the interview in the Washington Examiner, but did not publish the audio or a full transcript, as she has done with previous interviews with Trump.]

Note: [We did not hear back from Zito in regard to the availability of the full transcript. As the record for the interview is not complete, as a policy, we do not index the edited pieces.]
