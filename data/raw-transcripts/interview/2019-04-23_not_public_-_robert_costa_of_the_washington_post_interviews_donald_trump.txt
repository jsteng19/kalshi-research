Note: [The Washington Post's Robert Costa interviewed Donald Trump for a story he was writing on April 23, 2019.]

Note: [Costa responded to an email request stating that all material from the interview was published throughout the story linked below, other than material he was using for a longer-term story. As such, our editorial policy is to exclude it from the index.]

Note: [This is not a reflection on Costa or The Washington Post, but rather a reflection of our focus to be able to present interviews in their full context. We appreciate Costa's follow up and encourage him to release a transcript when he has used the material in his stories.]
