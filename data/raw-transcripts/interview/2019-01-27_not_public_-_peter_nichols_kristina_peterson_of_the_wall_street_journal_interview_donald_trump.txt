Note: [The Wall Street Journal's Peter Nicholas and Kristina Peterson interviewed Donald Trump on January 27, 2019.]

Note: [The Wall Street Journal has not responded to inquiries as to whether the entire interview's transcript will be published. Because the WSJ has elected not to publish it in full, or to respond to requests for a transcript, our editorial policy is to exclude it from the index. This is not a reflection on The Wall Street Journal, but rather a reflection of our focus to be able to present interviews in their full context.]

Note: [We encourage The Wall Street Journal to reconsider its decision in order to contribute to the public record.]
