Note: [Reporters from the Regional Reporters Association conducted an interview with Donald Trump after the 2019 State of the Union.]

Note: [Several reporters replied to inquiries in regard to a recording or transcript. In one case, we were told it was not editorial policy to release the full transcript. In two other cases, we were told it was understood that a transcript could not be released by any one organization.]

Note: [As such, our editorial policy is to exclude it from the index. This is not a reflection on the journalists or the Regional Reporters Association, but rather a reflection of our focus to be able to present interviews in their full context. We encourage journalists in the Regional Reporters Association to clarify this in the future and publish the transcript in full in order to contribute to the public record.]
