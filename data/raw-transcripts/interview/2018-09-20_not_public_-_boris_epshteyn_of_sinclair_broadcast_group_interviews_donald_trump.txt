Note: [Sinclair Broadcast Group's Boris Epshteyn of Breakfast with Boris published excerpts of his interview with Donald Trump in Las Vegas. These excerpts are available online.]

Note: [Because Epshteyn and Sinclair Broadcast Group has the entire interview, but has elected not to publish it in full, or confirm whether the three excerpts constitute the total of the interview, our editorial policy is to exclude it from the index. This is not a reflection on Sinclair Broadcast Group or Epshteyn, but rather a reflection of our focus to be able to present interviews in their full context.]
