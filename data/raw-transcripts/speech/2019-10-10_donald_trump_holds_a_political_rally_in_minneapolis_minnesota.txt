Donald Trump: Thank you very much. Thank you, Minnesota. This is a great state. We are going to win this state in a very short period of time. Thank you. This feels like the day before the election. So we have 20,000 plus people inside. We just set a new record and we have 25,000 people that we still love outside and close to 100,000 people wanted to come tonight.

Donald Trump: Thank you, all. This is great. This is great. Thank you. I want to thank our great Vice President, Mike Pence and Karen Pence for being here tonight. It is great to be back in the Twin Cities with the freedom-loving American patriots who make our country run. You know that. You know it. For the next 13 months, think of that, it seems like yesterday.

Donald Trump: For the next 13 months, we are going to fight with all of our heart and soul, and we are going to win the great state of Minnesota in 2020. America now has the number one economy anywhere in the world, and it's not even close. You know I'm dealing with China right now. They're in Washington, we're going to see we make a deal, but they want to make it. We're going to determine whether or not we want to make it. But they've been very nice, and today, I got a call from one of the top representatives.

Donald Trump: He said congratulations, Mr. President, on having a truly great, great economy. That's pretty nice. We picked up since the election trillions of dollars in value and China has lost trillions of dollars in value. I will say this: if our opponent had won that election, you know what would have happened? Right now China would become the night -- it would be the number one economy anywhere in the world.

Donald Trump: And right now I can tell you, they're not even close. Our country is stronger than ever before because we are proudly putting, for the first time in a long time, we are putting America first. [Audience chants "USA"] And I have to say, there are a lot of very beautiful red T-shirts in the audience. That was a record sale.

Donald Trump: They did very well and I'll tell you what, cops love Trump, Trump loves cops. Our bold pursuit of this pro-American agenda has enraged, and you know what's happened, it's enraged the failed ruling-class in Washington, not easy to get them out, but we're doing it slowly but surely. These corrupt politicians and the radical leftist got rich bleeding America dry and they knew that by-election would finally end their pillaging and looting of our country.

Donald Trump: And that's what they were doing and that's what they continue to try and do. That is why from day one the wretched Washington swamp has been trying to nullify the results of a truly great and Democratic election, the election of 2016. They're trying, they're not getting very far. They want to erase your vote like it, never existed.

Donald Trump: [Audience shouts "Boo"] They want to erase your voice and they want to erase your future, but they will fail because in America the people rule again. Do you remember that just 19 minutes after I raised my hand and took the oath of office, the Washington Post, a terrible newspaper that doesn't know how to write the truth, published a story, and in this case they might have gotten it pretty correct?

Donald Trump: They said the campaign to impeach President Trump has begun. That was the headline. [Audience shouts "Boo"] Little did we know they weren't playing. Think of that. That was 19 minutes after the oath of office, months earlier, Peter Strzok [Audience shouts "Boo"] remember he and his lover, Lisa Page. What a group.

Donald Trump: She's going to win, 10 million to one, she's going to win. I'm telling you, Peter. I'm telling you, Peter, she's going to win, Peter. Oh, I love you so much. I love you, Peter. I love you too, Lisa. Lisa, lisa, oh God, I love you, Lisa. And if she doesn't win Lisa, we've got an insurance policy Lisa. We'll get that son of a bitch out.

Donald Trump: We got an insurance -- and we're living through the insurance policy. That's what it is. The phony Russia hoax. [Audience shouts "Boo"] Lisa, I love you. Now the do-nothing Democrat con artists and scammers are getting desperate. Thirteen months, they got to move fast because they're not beating us at the polls and they know it despite the phony, despite the phony polls that you see all the time.

Donald Trump: They have phony polls, you know, polls are no different. Remember, I always used to talk about polls. I know polls very well. Polls are no different than crooked writers. They're crooked polls, crooked polls -- no different. Well, that's a lot of media. Look back there. That's a lot of media. [Audience shouts "Boo"] They are so dishonest and frankly, they are so bad for our country.

Donald Trump: They are so bad and they could be so good for our country. They could be so good, and maybe they'll change, and maybe they won't. I've been waiting for a long time. You know after I won the last election, I said you know, finally, it's OK. Finally, I get some great press. They got worse. They got worse. I said finally, we're going to get -- I said to the first lady, darling, we're going to finally get respect, we're going to finally get media and press coverage that's going to be great.

Donald Trump: Look at what we've done and I'm telling you they did. They got worse. [Audience shouts "Boo"] And they know they cannot win. You understand. Well, if you didn't understand honestly, there's no way anybody could win because you'd believe them. If you believed them there's no way anybody could win. It's just like 94%, I can do the greatest thing in history and they'll make them bad to very bad.

Donald Trump: And if I do a neutral, something neutral, it worked out OK, they're great now -- It's like give him the electric chair. That was terrible, right? No, this is the worst. [Audience member calls out "We love you, Trump"] These people and the Democrats, they are partners. It's a partnership. How about in the newscast like the word manufactured.

Donald Trump: It's manu -- and every newscaster, tonight in a manufactured deal along the border -- the word's never been used, now all of a sudden, all of the newscasters are using it. It's a talking point given to these fakers by the Democrats. So they know they can't win the 2020 election. So they're pursuing the insane impeachment which I've been going through it now.

Donald Trump: [Audience shouts "Boo"] I've been going through it now for more time than I've been in office because, you know, like Strzok with his insurance deal, this was before. Remember this, this was before -- that statement was made months before I took office. That statement was made months before the election took place.

Donald Trump: They said just in case, we're going to have an insurance policy. That only means one thing, we're going to get him out. So they're telling us. We can't let that ever happen again to another President. And Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, a lot of people, the great Mark Levin, we have a lot of great people, Lou Dobbs, great people.

Donald Trump: You know what they said? Every one of them plus many others, there's no other man that we've ever met that could have taken it. It's true, maybe I'm a little different up here. I don't know, but I enjoy it. To me, it's, I'm energized because we're draining the swamp. [Audience chants "Drain the swamp"] The Democrats' brazen attempt to overthrow our government will produce a backlash at the ballot box, the likes of which they have never ever seen before in the history of this country.

Donald Trump: These are bad people. My phone call as an example with the President of Ukraine. It was perfect, everybody that looked at it and the only reason I released it was that the Democrats put out a phony narrative. So I had no choice and I don't want to do that as President. Every time a President from a country calls me or I call them, we have to release the text.

Donald Trump: How can you do business that way? Who's going to want to speak to your President? So the President of Ukraine reiterated today at a major news conference on other subjects that he was under absolutely no pressure. He doesn't know what they're talking about and he used the word, there was no blackmail during this call.

Donald Trump: He used that term. So in theory, that should be the end of it. Think of it. A President of the United States who's made our economy with a lot of help from all of you frankly, but from Mike and from some of our great Senators and some of our great people that we have with us. We made this the strongest economy in our history.

Donald Trump: We've rebuilt our military, we're taking care of healthcare like nobody's been able to do. What we've done is incredible, and by the way, we're protecting your Second Amendment. If you don't have me, your Second Amendment is gone. So we have the greatest economy, the greatest military, we've rebuilt our military, $2.5 trillion because when I took it over, it was a mess, and what do they want to do? Let's impeach a President.

Donald Trump: Try it. I don't think so. I don't think so. I think we're going to have a turnout, the likes of which, we've never seen in the history of our country. So we were really forced, just to put it away, we were forced, I said just do it. Got the approval from Ukraine. I have to ask, I said hey, do you guys mind?

Donald Trump: They said that's a strange request, they said don't worry about it. Do you mind? And they said please, go ahead. Nothing was said wrong in that call. So we released the transcript of the call which was so good that that crooked Adam Schiff, this guy is crooked. [Audience shouts "Boo"] He had to make up a fake conversation that never happened and he delivered to the United States Congress and the American people.

Donald Trump: It was a total fraud and then Nancy Pelosi said, oh, I think the President said that. These people are sick. I'm telling you they're sick, and you know what had they waited one day longer, they would have had the transcript of the actual call, word for word, and it would have been perfect. Instead, they released it, they went early.

Donald Trump: They said all these horrible things. Do you know why? Because they never thought in a million years that I was going to release a transcript of the call. So Nancy Pelosi, upon hearing a false story from a whistleblower that had no clue what was going on in that call, or somebody gave a very bad advice, but also hearing it from shifty Schiff, Nancy Pelosi said, a day before seeing the transcript of the call with the Ukrainian President, we've got to impeach him.

Donald Trump: We've got to impeach him, right? And then she saw the call and she said to her people, what the hell? Nobody ever told me this was the call. But she keeps going anyway because the press is fake and they play right into their head. The do-nothing Democratic extremists have gone so far left that they believe it should not be crime to cross our border illegally, and it should be a crime to have a totally appropriate, casual, beautiful, accurate phone call with a foreign leader.

Donald Trump: I don't think so. As our brilliant Whitehouse counsel wrote to the Democrats yesterday, he said their highly partisan and unconstitutional effort threatens grave and lasting damage to our democratic institutions, to our system of free elections, and to the American people. That's what it is. To the American people.

Donald Trump: It's so terrible. Democrats are on a crusade to destroy our democracy. That's what's happening. We will never let it happen. We will defeat them. I mean, look at their debates. These people are crazy. They want to spend $99 trillion to redo buildings all over the United States. I said what about China? What about Russia?

Donald Trump: What about India? What about all these other countries where that stuff is just flowing out? It's all right. Let him give you the answer. Man do the cops act fast. He's already gone. Man, that's unbelievable. That's the fastest. You know I have -- look, I love law enforcement. I love the cops. I love the police, I love Minneapolis.

Donald Trump: Minneapolis. You've got a rotten Mayor. You've got to change your Mayor. You've got a bad Mayor, got a bad Mayor, but you know what? The police I've done this a lot, and every once in a while, you have -- very little disturbance. It's really -- actually is there any place where we can have more fun than at a Trump rally?

Donald Trump: And we've set every record at every place virtually that we've gone, and one of the big musicians said, and Trump does it without a guitar. Can you believe without a guitar? But this guy, so I've had it a lot where, you know, but sometimes It'll take the police like 30 seconds, 50 seconds, it's like Roger Penske, when you watch him -- who's getting the Presidential Medal of Freedom by the way very soon.

Donald Trump: Great. He won 18 Indy 500, 18, Roger Penske, but it's like the way they change those tires. It takes four seconds to change a whole damn thing. I say how the hell did they do it? That's the way these cops just reacted. That was a record. I think it was. I've had good service but I've never had anything like that.

Donald Trump: I look up, the guy is already gone. We love you with the red shirts. So now the Democrats are making a pathetic bid to save sleepy Joe, sleepy Joe Biden. [Unidentified] And you know what, I'd love to run against him to be honest. Anybody like that, if you can't beat him in a debate, you've got a big problem folks.

Donald Trump: You can't beat him in a debate, you can't be President, because what are you going to do against President Xi and Kim Jong-un? You can't beat sleepy Joe, but now we're going to meet with Kim Jong-un. I don't think so. But he's totally owned and totally controlled by the Washington swamp for many years. Two months after President Obama put Joe in charge of Ukraine policy, they put Joe Biden in charge of Ukraine policy.

Donald Trump: Listen to this, and the press won't write it. They say, in totally unsubstantiated charges, every time they talk about him. President Trump has said his son walked away with a fortune. Now you know that's a totally unsubstantiated charge, really? It's not unsubstantiated, it's fact. Joe's son, Hunter, got thrown out of the navy and then he became a genius on Wallstreet two days.

Donald Trump: By the way, whatever happened to Hunter? Where the hell is he? Where's Hunter? Hey, fellas, I have a new idea for a new T-shirt. I love the cops but let's do another T-shirt, where's Hunter? Where is he? Here's Hunter being examined by sleepy eyes Chuck Todd or some of these people. Hunter, it's so great that you're here, sir.

Donald Trump: Um, Hunter, I know they're giving you approximately $168,000 a month. I hear they paid you a big check of $3 million, I just want to speak, on behalf of NBC, who's absolutely one of the worst, I just want to tell you. Hunter, Hunter, I just want to tell you, I couldn't be happier for you and your family and I know you don't know anything about energy, and I know it's an energy company.

Donald Trump: But I think they made a great deal, Hunter. And then they fly to China and I'm dealing with people right now. They're tough as hell those Chinese negotiators. And Hunter is not too smart. He goes in, he has a meeting, he walks out in his fund with $1.5 billion, with a B, billion dollars. These aren't the same Chinese negotiators that I'm dealing with, I can tell you.

Donald Trump: These are not the same ones but we are doing very well in that negotiation. Now think of it, where's Hunter? OK get -- where is Hunter? I want to see Hunter asked this way. Hunter, you know nothing about energy, you know nothing about China, you know nothing about anything, frankly. Hunter, you're a loser.

Donald Trump: Why did you get $1.5 billion, Hunter? And your father was never considered smart, he was never considered a good Senator. He was only a good Vice President because he understood how to kiss Barack Obama's ass. [Audience chants "USA"] Thank you. Thank you. It's true. It's true and they're always saying the same thing.

Donald Trump: Yeah, he got $1.5 billion, we admit it, they admit it. There's nothing but always that same thing, President Trump made a totally unsubstantiated claim about Hunter Biden and his father. It's not unsubstantiated you crooked son of a guns. It's 100% true. Even the smart guys on Wallstreet and I know all of them, and they are smart.

Donald Trump: They've never seen anything like that one before. I'd call them, does that ever happen, never happens. Guy walks in, no experience, no nothing, walks out with a big and five G, flies in on Air Force Two with his father, the Vice President. Don't forget, that's when he was Vice President. So China gives his son $1.5 billion.

Donald Trump: How would you like to have Joe Biden take over negotiations right now with China? I don't think so. I don't think so. Meanwhile, Biden allowed China to rip off America for eight years, as Vice President and Barack Obama let him just rob us blind, and we're not doing that anymore. Those days are over. The Bidens got rich and that is substantiated while America got robbed.

Donald Trump: That's what happened. Sleepy Joe and his friends sold out America. They didn't have tough negotiations. I look at these trade deals and I'd say who the hell could have done this? If you didn't, if you had no business instinct, no business ability, if you had nothing, if you're dumb as hell, you wouldn't make these deals, They're so bad.

Donald Trump: I say who made these deals? Who made these deals? But we're ripping them all up and redoing them and they're going to be very good. Wait 'til you see what happens and now that I'm your President, you see it. America is winning again and we're respected again as a nation. [Audience chants "USA"] And in a brand new report, just came out as I'm walking on the stage, hard to believe actually.

Donald Trump: It turns out that Joe Biden was Vice President. He worked with the so-called whistleblower. This is nothing but a partisan witch hunt sabotage and I'm sure they're going to say, it's totally unsubstantiated, but one of them wrote this story. Congratulations, by the way. Congratulations, that's really good.

Donald Trump: That's the way you should do it. Good. Good. Good. In the twisted worldview of Democrats and the media, it's OK for politicians to ship our jobs to foreign countries, flood our communities with drugs and crime, and enrich themselves at America's expense. Their treachery is allowed because they go along with the rigged Washington game and it is far more rigged.

Donald Trump: When I ran, I thought it was rigged but this is crazy what's happening. But if you refuse to bow or bend to the Washington swamp, which I could do very easily, I'd be much more popular. Folks, I'd be -- it would be so much easier. You know a very smart, I got it and I got to tell you isn't it much better when I go off script?

Donald Trump: Isn't that better? So much and it's just, it's just -- hey folks, the greatest buyer of advertisements in the history of the world, Mike Lindow, my pillow. I have never seen so many ads. I think he's the greatest ad negotiator in history, and I told him, I said would you do me a favor? All the money we spend in these political campaigns, if I gave some of that money to Mike, I think we'd have ads every single minute of every single shot.

Donald Trump: I never saw so many. Anyway -- but the lawless political establishment will try to frame you, they'll persecute you, they'll swear, and just swear up and down that they're telling the truth. When Nancy Pelosi was on television the other day, I have to say, I have to say, I was very proud of George Stephanopoulos.

Donald Trump: I was very proud. It's not often, she said no, no, shifty Schiff told the truth when he said that. Stephanopoulos said no, wait a minute, no, it wasn't the truth. It was a falsehood. No, no, it's the truth. He said no and did she -- she really believes it. So she's either got one of two problems: she's either really stupid, OK, or she's really lost it, or maybe there's a certain dishonesty in this some -- but they smear you.

Donald Trump: They spy on you, and they target your friends, your family, your staff for harassment, for abuse, for destruction. I came down to Washington with incredible people. We want a great political campaign. They were bright-eyed and bushy-tailed. We know that's a nice phrase. They came down. They were happy, they wanted to turn the country around.

Donald Trump: They wanted to do great things, all of a sudden, they get summoned and they get subpoenaed by Robert Mueller. How good was he is a witness? Not too good. And by people that were, I call them, the 13 angry Democrats that turned into 18 angry Democrats. It was disgraceful. So people that were going down. Sir, what is this?

Donald Trump: I look, oh wow, that's a subpoena. What the hell is this? They took people, I really mean this, they took people that were full of life and energy and vigor. We had just won the greatest campaign in the history of American politics. It's true. It's true and they destroyed their lives. They destroyed their lives.

Donald Trump: They went home. I could name many people, one in particular, who came down, an incredible young woman. She was going to help people. She wanted to help people, she had causes that was so good, she wanted to help people, and she ended up going home. Dark, dark. Her life became hell. They ruined people. They destroyed -- they destroyed people, good people.

Donald Trump: People that ended up paying far more money in legal fees than they made than they made. They destroyed great people. They're vicious, horrible, and the media was behind every single step. [Audience shouts "Boo"] They destroyed so many lives. They destroyed so many lives and they're continuing to do it, and it's a disgrace.

Donald Trump: When all of their ludicrous hoaxes have been exposed as frauds, these sinister fakers, then tried to impeach you for daring to call out their own corruption. There's nothing like the dirty political establishment, and I have to tell you, this is you know a friend of mine, very smart, brilliant guy, he was with me about two weeks ago.

Donald Trump: We just got rid of the Russia hoax and then, a week later, the Ukraine hoax starts. I had a week of like, I can think about everything perfect, it's so beautiful and he said President, I said call me Donald, you've called me Donald for 35 years. I will, thank you, Donald. I've lost all my friends because they're all scared to talk you know -- like, you know, honestly, I'm the President.

Donald Trump: They can't talk to me anymore. It's like they're afraid. They respect the office, it's true, they say, President, I say, do me a favor Richard, you've called me Donald for 35 years. Call me Donald, please. I want somebody to call me Donald. [Audience chants "Donald"] True. He said to me, I just told him call me -- he said President, I can't do it, he said.

Donald Trump: So is this President, you've been here now for, think of it, almost three years. Can you believe we're here three years? We, we, it's we. And we have to promise them no more than 16 years, OK? No more. No more, 16 more years, I'm all he could. Now they'll go back, see he wants to run for more but he said, he said, President, can I ask you a question?

Donald Trump: It's so important to me. You deal -- he's a great businessman, very successful. He said you deal with all of these nations, these great, powerful, who is the worst to deal with is it China? Is it North Korea? Is it India? Is it Russia? Please tell me, Mr. President, who is the toughest nation to deal with?

Donald Trump: I said you're not going to believe this. It's the USA, is the toughest nation to deal with, the USA. It's true because we're dealing with some very sick and deranged people. [Audience shouts "Boo"] There's nothing that the dirty political establishment hates more than a President that they cannot intimidate, own, and control.

Donald Trump: They're, trying to stop me because they know that I don't answer to them, I answer to you. It's true. You know I never say this. I don't think I've ever said it in a speech but maybe they'll find out if I did. Then they'll give me Pinocchio's, he said it before, but I don't know if I ever said it. But you know, I make as President about $4450,000, I give it away.

Donald Trump: No, wait. I don't care, I don't care. I never hear anything. Can you imagine if I didn't? I give it away to -- you can only give it. You can't keep it. You can't actually make a gift. You can give it to your different agencies. So I can give it to health, I can give it to transportation, I can give it to military, but I give it away all the time, every -- Now and if I ever did but it's $450,000. If somebody stays from let's say a Middle East country in one of my hotels, and we charge him $392.50 for staying, and I never heard of the guy and I don't want to hear about him.

Donald Trump: They say Trump is getting rich off our nation. I lose billions being President, I don't care. It's nice to be rich, I guess. But I lose billions. If somebody rents a room someplace and they pay me two months in rent or hotel fees. I never heard of the people. I never know who they are. They say emoluments.

Donald Trump: Nobody ever heard of the word emoluments before. Emoluments, it's the craziest thing I've ever seen. I tell you, it's cost me billions of dollars to be President, it really has. And at some point, I'll probably have to prove that and I look forward to do it. It's very easy. It's very easy. And there is nothing that makes me happier than making that decision to run and win and straighten out the mess that these people have created.

Donald Trump: So in a desperate attempt to attack our movement, Nancy and Chuck, two beauties, have given control of the Democrat party entirely over to the radical left, including Minnesota's own representative, Ilhan Omar. [Audience shouts "Boo"] You know, I know you people, I know you people, I know the people of Minnesota, and I want to tell you, and I also at the same time, it's both the question and this statement, how the hell did that ever happen?

Donald Trump: How did it happen? How did it happen? Congresswoman Omar is an America-hating socialist. She minimized the September 11th attack on our homeland were far more than 3,000 people died saying some people did something, big deal, some people did something. She pleaded for compassion for ISIS recruits right here in Minnesota.

Donald Trump: Omar left that Americans speak of al-Qaida, do you remember that tape? Speak of al-Qaida but when we say, well, we say something about the United States, you just don't say America with any intensity. Remember that? Representative Omar has a history of launching virulent, anti-semitic screeds, whether you like it or not.

Donald Trump: She said the US support for Israel is all about the Benjamins. She said that pro-Israel lawmakers have an allegiance to a foreign country. Omar wrote that Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them to see the evil doings of Israel and the United States. [Audience shouts "Boo"] How do you have such a person representing you in Minnesota?

Donald Trump: I'm very angry at you people right here. She is a disgrace to our country and she is one of the big reasons that I'm going to win and the Republican Party is going to win Minnesota in 13 months. [Unidentified] Thank you very much. So we're honored to have with us today a special guest, a man that really is a terrific, talented writer.

Donald Trump: He knows a great deal about all those tangled lies of Omar, Mr. Scott Johnson of Power Line. He wrote some stuff. I can't believe it. Where's Scott? Where's Scott? Thank you, Scott. Thank you, Scott. What a job. Man, do you have her figured out. The only problem is Scott, it's incredible talent, much more talented than most of these people that you heard about.

Donald Trump: The problem is they never pick it up. They don't want to pick it up but we pick it up, Scott, and the people get it, and we thank you for your great reporting. Thank you. Thank you very much. As Scott reported, everything about Omar is a fraud, including her name. Scott reports, his sources told him that quote, Omar's legal husband was Omar's brother and that she had married him for fraudulent purposes.

Donald Trump: You mean, like, coming into the United States, maybe? And as God says, we have seen a plethora of Congressional scandals in our history. Yet we have never seen scandals like Omar's in Congress and nothing gets done about it. I hope, I hope that some of you people are looking because what AOC has gotten away with campaign financing, and what -- I call it AOC plus three, that's what it is and Omar is one of the three.

Donald Trump: What AOC has gotten away with all of that money that she used for her personal self with campaign finance is worse and nothing happens to them, but it happens to you, and it's not fair. The fact is, we're in a struggle for the survival of democracy in America. The only message these radical socialists and extremists will understand is a crushing defeat on November 3rd, 2020. With your help, we will win back the House, we will keep the Senate, and we will win the White House.

Donald Trump: And we're thrilled to be joined tonight by some incredible people that have helped me so much, one of your tremendous, talented, tough Congressman Tom Emmer, Tom. Also, a man, you don't want to fight him and you don't want to play him in hockey because he was tough. He just won, not that recently but pretty recently, and I was out here campaigning for him and working hard and it turned out to be an easy race because everyone loves him and respects him.

Donald Trump: Congressman Pete Stauber. And a man who gets in the trenches and he just doesn't care. He wants to win for the people. He loves you. He loves this state. He loves his country, Jim Hagedorn. And a great friend of mine, with his incredible family, he's a friend, he's smart, I guess, you'd say he's brilliant.

Donald Trump: His education is incredible. His military career has been incredible. Then he ran for office and now he's a United States senator from the great State of Arkansas, Senator Tom Cotton. Great guy. And Minnesota Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka. Paul, thank you, Paul. Minnesota GOP Chairwoman, Jennifer Carnahan.

Donald Trump: She's been incredible. I said Jennifer, are we going to win in 13 months? She said honestly, sir, I've never seen anything like this. It's going to be easy. Don't ever say that. Just assume we're like two points behind, OK? Two points behind. You never ever, please, you always just assume you're a little behind but we're going to win this state by so much that people are going to be shocked, and plenty of other states too.

Donald Trump: You know we had a rally three weeks ago in New Mexico and New Mexico is a hard state for Republicans, hasn't been won in a long time also, and we had receptivity that was unbelievable. The audience was 40% Hispanic where we're doing great. And you know Hispanic they understand borders better than anybody, better than we do. They understand safety, they understand their job, they don't want people taking it away, they don't want crime, they understand it better that's why we're doing so well.

Donald Trump: But we're in New Mexico, and I'm telling you that was electric. But honestly, all evenings are electric. We haven't had any bad ones. We haven't. They're all, all right. A woman who headed up the great state of Michigan for me, a state that hadn't been won in a long time by Republicans for whatever reason, but it hadn't been run.

Donald Trump: I guess we didn't have the right candidates, right? But a woman who would call me constantly. I said I don't want to talk to her, she's giving me a headache. Sir, if you make one more trip, you're going to win Michigan. I said all right, I make the trip, I go back home. I get a call the next morning, sir, we need one more.

Donald Trump: This went over and over and over, and we ended up winning the state of Michigan, and I said who the hell was that woman that kept bugging me to go back to Michigan? It's just one more time every week, one more time, sir, and her name is Ronna McDaniel, she's fantastic, and she's the head of the RNC. She's great and our campaign manager, a man who's really been -- you know they used to say that crooked Hillary had a very, very sophisticated campaign.

Donald Trump: After she lost they said, I guess, it wasn't sophisticated. We had a sophisticated campaign. Nobody knows the world of computers better than this guy, Brad Parscale. Remember when they used to say it? You know I never got credit. My father used to teach me if you can do it for less and win that's good. He wasn't talking politics.

Donald Trump: The last thing -- he's looking down. He's definitely looking down, not lookin' up. He was good, he was tough, but he was great. But my father, my father would say, if you could do it for less and win, that's a good thing, not a bad thing. If you can build a building for less money than the guy across the street, and if it's a nicer building, and you can rent for less, you really, that's a good thing.

Donald Trump: So in the campaign, we spend much less money than crooked Hillary Clinton, much and we won and we won. We won 306 to 223 that's our pretty big. Remember? Remember they said electoral college, and by the way, when you run, if you're running the electoral college is like the hundred-yard dash and the total vote -- you don't go certain places, you focus.

Donald Trump: Electoral college, we had to explain to them. It's different. So we won three or six, and you remember they used to say once the 100-yard dash, you practice, once the mile, you practice. It's a different race. Winning the total vote is much easier, in my opinion. The electoral college, I had to go to 22 different states for the total vote.

Donald Trump: I go to like four states maximum, right? Much easier, it's much easier. I'm all for it but the electoral college is better for our country because it forces you to go places that you wouldn't go. I love Maine. I went to Maine four or five times. I needed one point, Maine gave me one point, and what happened?

Donald Trump: What happened? I went there numerous times, everyone said why? Because I was told by these fraudsters, back here in the media that Trump, Trump cannot get to 270. He cannot get. They had me maximum and everything worked, right? At 269 so I kept going to Maine. And you know what? We won that one point in Maine.

Donald Trump: But I kept going. They say why? I said well, first of all, it is really a beautiful place. But we won the point but they said he cannot get to 270. I heard this for month and months and months. I had such a headache, almost as bad as listening to Mike's damn commercials about those pillows. Maybe I need one of those pillows to cure my headache.

Donald Trump: Does it cure headaches? I think so. But here's the thing, here's the thing, so they said he cannot get to 270. In other words, you can't win. If you can't get to 270 you can't win, right? He cannot do it. There's no way of doing it and they were right. I got to 306. They were right but I didn't get to 306, you got to 306. We won in incredible states.

Donald Trump: We won Wisconsin. We won Michigan. We won Pennsylvania. We won North Carolina. We won South Carolina. We won Florida. What a run. Do you remember the evening that we won? I think -- look forgetting, I think, it was one of all of us together because we all worked hard. I was the messenger but we all worked hard.

Donald Trump: That was our victory, not my victory but that was one of the greatest nights in the history of television, one of the greatest nights. And hopefully, it'll go down when we're allowed to get all of this stuff seeded. You know it's like a tree. You plant it, you plant it, it has to go but it needs a little -- that's why we need the four more additional years.

Donald Trump: It's got to grab on and catch so they can't destroy it, so they can't destroy it. But I think it'll go down and I hope it's going to go down as one of the greatest evenings in the history of this country because it's never happened anything like that before, and these guys don't even question it. They just sit back and say, I guess, he's right about that.

Donald Trump: I'll never forget the night before, I was at a tremendous arena. The place was going crazy. It was like this, going crazy, and two reporters that hate my guts, they looked at themselves, they looked at each other, a famous shot. They're looking like this and they're saying, what the hell is going on? They knew.

Donald Trump: They knew. And I didn't need Beyonce and Jay-Z, and I didn't need a little Bruce Springsteen and all of these people but they'd come in because you couldn't get a crowd. They'd come in that thing, they got Bruce Springsteen, OK? He'd do about two songs and leave. What happens is they leave and then everyone leaves with him, and she's still speaking in front of the same lousy crowd.

Donald Trump: Craziest, craziest thing I've ever seen, and then they complain, sometimes I'll use a terrible word like hell. The other day I use the word hell. I got it. I got hell from -- they said he used terrible language. I used the word hell, it was so bad but you've got to hear Jay-Z, the words he was using. He was using the F-word all over the place, and then the next day they say I use bad language.

Donald Trump: The word hell is a terrible word. These people are sick but that was an amazing evening. I'll never forget that evening. It's you know, look, outside of your family and your children and things. [Unidentified] I love you too, darling. It was one of the highest-rated evenings in the history of television.

Donald Trump: You add up all those networks. Remember the woman crying, oh, my God. No, they weren't biased at all. Now another very special man who's with us today, but he'll never be a man to me, he'll always be my boy. You know what I mean, right? He's my boy, he's my little six foot six boy, Eric Trump. And the parents understand that, right?

Donald Trump: They may be big and strong and older, and to a parent, a child is always their boy or always their little beautiful girl, and I know that's probably politically incorrect. They'll say, it was terrible what he said about women, Carol. But they're our boy and They're our girl, and it doesn't matter how old we get and how old they get.

Donald Trump: Is that a correct statement? And I'm also proud to endorse your next Republican Senator from Minnesota, a man that I've known, a man that is tough and smart, a man that's running against somebody that's never done a damn thing in the Senate, Mr. Jason Lewis, and Jason did a great job in Congress. Congressman Lewis, thank you very much, and thank you for putting up with all of this stuff because I'll tell you, it's going to be nasty.

Donald Trump: It's going to be nasty. They're going to make up stories about you. They get to say things that's going to want to make your wife say, why did I marry this guy? Just say don't worry about it. It's just another phony story. Thank you very much, Mr. and Mrs. Lewis. Jason, thank you. And Jason, they can't say that about Tom Cotton.

Donald Trump: He's too perfect this guy, he can't -- they can't say it about you, Tom. Anyway, good luck, Jason. Do well. And I don't know why but with all of the great people I just introduced for tonight, maybe this is the most important verse because I turned down a very good show in the morning, Fox and Friends. They treat us great.

Donald Trump: I just want fair. What a great group, Ainsley and Steve, and by the way, Brian has gotten a lot better, right? Brian was a seven and he's getting close to ten territories, and Steve has been so great, and Ainsley is just incredible. And sometimes Pete Hegseth gets on there for the weekend. And how good does Jesse Waters do? How good?

Donald Trump: All right. There's some really great people, and again, Tucker has been very good. I have to say he's been very good. Smart, he's been great, Tucker. And the legendary Sean Hannity, great, number one, number one show. Sean's got the number one show, and Laura Ingram does not get him out of the park, Laura.

Donald Trump: And you go over, Maria Bartiromo and the great Lou Dobbs. How good are they? Lou Dobbs and many more, many more. How about Greg? Greg used to hate me, now he's good? Oh, we can't forget, we can't forget, Judge Jeanine. I would be in such trouble if I forgot Judge Jeanine. You know he's a grinder -- anyway, I'm just, you know, look, I'm just rattling some names but they're just terrific people, they're terrific people but a man that I have to really say something very special about.

Donald Trump: So I'm watching Fox and Friends early in the morning, very early in the morning like 6:00, like slack because I'm out of there pretty good and I see a handsome young man named Bob Kroll, Cops for Trump, and he's talking about this lousy Mayor. They've gotten -- he didn't quite say that, but I say it, he's talking about this lousy Mayor that won't let the cops, the police, the law enforcement.

Donald Trump: You know my father always used to say son, he meant it too, never say cops. It's disrespectful, say, police officers, I say I keep up, but honestly, the truth is with time, I love you guys whether you're cops, police officers, law enforcement, I'll call you whatever you want, it doesn't matter. You are so great, so respected.

Donald Trump: You don't even know how much our public loves you, you don't know it. You don't know it. When I see this guy and I don't know if he's done a lot of television before but he was very effective and very good, and he was saying how the police aren't being allowed to take care of this rally. And yet with President Obama and Bush and all these people who were, you know, find -- everybody comes, they fall asleep at a rally but they weren't, they weren't allowed to do the job for us, and they went wild.

Donald Trump: So what I want to do [Unidentified] go home to mommy. Mommy says I saw you on television tonight. I love Trump. Don't you ever do that again? Yes, mom, yes. But the job he did before the election, I came right here to Minnesota, and I pledge to address this really important issue, and it's the issue of law enforcement.

Donald Trump: And when I saw this man, this great gentleman on television, pouring out his guts, pouring out his heart, I don't know. He knows I've been good to law enforcement. He knows I've been good to, as my father would say, the police. He knows I love the cops. He knows that and so does everyone else. I mean, I've had so many shirts, so many red shirts, and they're plenty people here without the red shirts, and I want to just tell you the respect that we have for law enforcement is unbound. It's unbound. Come up here. Bob come up.

Bob Kroll: What can I say after that? Tune in Fox 10:15 tonight, Shannon Bream, they asked us on. How can you thank those guys for everything he's done for law enforcement? A wonderful President. Thank you very much.

Donald Trump: Thank you, great people. Thank you. What a group, I think, you're very weak Mayor, made a mistake when he took them on. As you know, for many years leaders in Washington brought large numbers of refugees to your state from Somalia, without considering the impact on schools and communities and taxpayers.

Donald Trump: I promise you that as President, I would give local communities a greater say in refugee policy and put in place enhanced vetting and responsible immigration control and I've done that. Since coming into office, I have reduced refugee resettlement by 85%, and as you know, maybe especially in Minnesota, I kept another promise.

Donald Trump: I issued an executive action making clear that no refugees will be resettled in any city or any state without the express written consent of that city or that state. So speak to a Mayor. You should be able to decide what is best for your own cities and for your own neighborhoods, and that's what you have the right to do right now, and believe me, no other President would be doing that.

Donald Trump: If Democrats were ever to seize power, they would open the floodgates to unvetted uncontrolled migration at levels you have never seen before. Do you think gathered bad now? You would never have seen anything like what they want to do but in the Trump administration we will always protect American families first, and that has not been done in Minnesota.

Donald Trump: We've also implemented the strongest screening and vetting mechanisms ever put into place. We are keeping terrorists, criminals, and extremists the hell out of our country, and I want to thank the country of Mexico. The President of Mexico has been incredible. We have now 27,000 Mexican soldiers. They're great and they're tough, and they are now protecting our border and those numbers have gone down like -- thank you, Mr. President.

Donald Trump: We will not make the mistakes made in European countries that allow a violent ideology to take root in our country on our shores. We're not going to allow it to happen, and as you all know, to protect our citizens from those who would do harm to us. I instituted a very controversial, very hard to get travel ban on some of the world's most dangerous countries.

Donald Trump: And the other day, one of the fake news reporters in the back said, they were talking about the travel ban, and they said, well, you know, the President has lost in court, they said where? On the travel ban. And he's right I lost and I lost in the Regional Division, and then, I won in the United States Supreme Court.

Donald Trump: Right? And he knew that but he said I lost and he was right. I lost and then I lost again but then, I won. And we have the travel ban. But instead of saying he lost and then he lost at the -- and then he won at the United States Supreme Court, he said, he lost on the travel ban. These are very dishonest people.

Donald Trump: You do understand that, very dishonest people. In the Republican party, we believe that those who seek to join our society must embrace our values, honor our history, and love our people. Democrats also deadly sanctuary cities which release dangerous criminal aliens into the heart of your communities and we're not letting it happen anymore.

Donald Trump: Republicans believe American cities should be sanctuaries for Americans not for criminal aliens. My administration is taking a historic action to secure the borders. We have reduced illegal border crossings by over 60% since May and we are building the wall faster than anyone ever anticipated, it could be built.

Donald Trump: And this is a serious wall. You've all seen it. It's going up rapidly and you think that was easy? I had every Democrat in Congress fighting me, fighting me, fighting me. I had a lot of the RINOs fighting me. They say, see he's not getting it built. He not get -- let me tell you. You have every Democrat fighting you.

Donald Trump: We took it from here and we took it from there and we took it from all over the place, and we got that thing that's the biggest patchwork of financing you've ever seen, and that sucker is going up, and it is the finest, it is the strongest, it's largely 30-feet tall, which is the maximum height that they wanted.

Donald Trump: [Audience chants "Build the wall"] I went to the Border Patrol and I sat down with 15 representatives of the Border Patrol, and I said what do you want? What's your ideal? I actually said I want to give you the Rolls Royce and they killed me for that because it's not an American-made product, they happen to be right.

Donald Trump: No, they're right about that one. They're actually right there, Tom. But I said I want to give you the Rolls Royce of walls. Tell me and they told me everything and then we built some alternative walls. We built all different types. We built about seven of them and then we had climbers come in. The one that worked the best was the one we're building.

Donald Trump: It also, unfortunately, the bad news is it's also the most expensive, but we got it for the right price. We got it for the right price. It's steel, it's hardened concrete, it's deep, it's high, it's a thing of beauty, and it's going to keep bad people out of our country. That's what it's going to do and the Democrats know this.

Donald Trump: Most of the Democrats four years ago, they wanted a wall. Now, all of a sudden, they don't want a wall. You know why they don't want a wall? Because I want it. It's the only reason. And I just thought of it, you know, like a year ago, I said, man, this could have been so much easier. All I had to do is say, we don't want a wall and they would have given me all the financing I wanted for the wall.

Donald Trump: What was I thinking? We're not going to build a wall and they would have forced me to build and I would have -- Under this administration, we are also ending the endless wars. We have to do it, folks. We have to do it. We have totally defeated the ISIS caliphate and I did that in rather quick time if you remember because we have the greatest fighting machine.

Donald Trump: Now, when I came in it was totally depleted. We have great Generals, we have great warfighters, and they did it so fast. I flew to Iraq. I met with the Generals, right? I met with the Generals. I said I hear it's going to take a year to two years. Sir, we could do it in two weeks. I said what? They don't let us fight, sir.

Donald Trump: They don't let us fight. We want to fight. They don't let us fight. I said I'll let you fight. I said how come they say it's going to take anywhere from a year to two years you say you can do it so quickly? He said, sir, we're going to hit them from the front. We're going to hit them from the back. We're going to hit them from the sides, from underground, from over, we're going to hit the hell out of them, and they did, and we won very quickly.

Donald Trump: But from now on, we want to fight where it's to the benefit of the United States of America, not to the benefit of other countries, and we will only fight to win. We're only going to fight to win. We don't fight to win, we don't fight to win. The Turks have been fighting with the Kurds for two centuries and Turkey, as you know, is a NATO ally but I've been rough on them.

Donald Trump: We've defeated 100% of that ISIS caliphate and no longer have any troops in the area. We don't have any troops. The troops have been pulled out where Turkey is carrying out now a very tough campaign against the Kurds. Get them out. So Turkey is right now waging a very tough campaign against the Kurds. We get along with the Kurds and we help the Kurds.

Donald Trump: Don't forget they're also fighting for their land, you know that but they're fighting. So we have three choices, are you ready? Here are the three choices. We don't have any soldiers there because we've left. We won, we left. Take a victory United States. We left, take a victory. Take a victory, bring our troops back home.

Donald Trump: I told this story yesterday. I have to sign letters. It's the hardest thing I have to do. I signed letters, Dear Mr. and Mrs. Smith from Arkansas. Dear Mr. and Mrs. Jones from Alabama. Dear Mr. and Mrs.. somebody from some great state. I'm sorry to inform you your son has been killed in combat. I'm so sorry and every letter is individually done because sometimes the parents they're grieving and they get together with other parents and they get -- and I don't want to see that it's like the same letter.

Donald Trump: So we do different letters, it's the hardest thing I have to do, hardest thing. It's the hardest thing I have -- I was telling Tom Cotton, it's the hardest thing that I have to do and I signed those letters and it just -- it breaks your heart. And then, and by the way, there's a time to fight. Nobody fights harder than I do. But there's a time and there's not necessarily a time but I send these letters out quite a few and sometimes I send letters out.

Donald Trump: It's called Blue and green where we're teaching people how to fight, and then they turned the gun on our soldiers and shoot them in the back, and that's the hardest thing for a parent. I have all of them. I know every one. That's the hardest thing for a parent when they get notification because they learn how their child has died.

Donald Trump: When these so-called people that we're teaching how to fight turned the gun on them, and we've had a lot of that, a lot of it in Afghanistan, more than we've ever had proportionately before. It's a horrible, horrible thing but I have to sign these letters and sometimes I go out to a place, Dover Air Force base.

Donald Trump: It's a very tough experience. Mike Pence goes, I go, other people go, Tom Cotton goes, we go out there and we meet the parents and the families, the wives, the children, the sisters, the brothers, we meet them and we talk to them. And their son or daughter is being flown in from some faraway place in a Coffin and these things are just impossible.

Donald Trump: I don't know how parents can do it even, and I'll meet them, and we have a particular Colonel. That's all he does. So good, so professional, and that's what he does. He said I greet the dead, sir. I greet the dead, and what happens is, this big incredible machine flies in, this tremendous cargo plane, and it flies in, so powerful, so big, and I'll be talking to some of the parents and they'll act like they're fine.

Donald Trump: I said how are you doing? We're fine, sir. We're fine. We're really good. I say that's great and I'll tell the Colonel and say, Colonel, I think you're doing great. No, sir. They're not going to do great you'll see, and I didn't know what he was talking about. This is the first time and then we went outside to the runway and this incredible machine is flying in and it lands and it comes over and it pulls up and we have military guards.

Donald Trump: We have incredible, talented musicians that do this, that's what they do. And what happens is that door opens up and the Colonel told me, he said, sir, when that door opens, those same people that you think are OK do things that you'll never see, you'll hear sounds like you've never heard. That's what he does and I saw that door open up with a coffin with a flag over it. The door is open and these beautiful soldiers, five or six on each side, lifting the coffin and walking down the runway, the plank, they call it, off this cargo plane, and I see parents make sounds that were just 20 minutes ago.

Donald Trump: Absolutely fine, make sounds, scream and cry like you've never seen before. The Colonel was telling me that, sir, you'll see things that you've never seen before. A mother who was fine 20 minutes ago, you think, breaking the military line and jumping off and then jumping onto a coffin of her son or her daughter, jumping on, on top of the flowers on top of the American flag.

Donald Trump: I've seen this and then I have all these people that want to stay. They want to stay and I don't want to stay. We were supposed to be in Syria for 30 days. We've now been there for 10 years. We were supposed to be in Afghanistan for a short period of time, we're now going to be there for close to 19 years, it's time to bring them home.

Donald Trump: It's time to bring them home. It's true. It's time to bring them home. We've done our job. We've defeated everyone that we're supposed to defeat, and now we are, we are now policing. We are now policing. That's what we're doing we're policing and that, as I said, no more respect for the police, but these are military people and those are police.

Donald Trump: But we are now policing. We're not fighting, we're policing, and you know what, after all of these years, and one other story, and I have to tell you. I go to Walter Reed on Friday and I do it quite often. I gave out five Purple Hearts and I meet people that are so beautiful, so amazing. I met five warriors and one was so badly hurt with a loss of arms and a leg.

Donald Trump: Another one -- they're just very, very devastated but these are great, great people, and I gave out the Purple Heart. I see the parents and I have to say, Walter Reed, I wanted to say the doctors there, the job they do. You know you hear so many complaints about doctors and about the vets and the vets care and nobody's done better.

Donald Trump: We got choice for the vets. We did things for the vets that nobody thought would be possible but I saw these young men and I gave them their Purple Hearts and their parents were there crying. And one of them was so amazing, I said what's your problem, sir? My face was blown apart. My nose was absolutely just blown apart.

Donald Trump: He said, sir, it's incredible and I looked at him. I said that's the most beautiful nose I've ever seen. What do you mean? He said a doctor worked on my face for 10 hours in the field. He said there were a thousand fragments. Now I don't know if that's right but, well, a lot, he meant a lot. He said there were a thousand fragments.

Donald Trump: He rebuilt my nose with glue, he glued the bones together. He rebuilt my nose. I say you have the most beautiful nose I've ever seen and it's true. And his father came over to me, he said, sir, father was crying. He said, sir, honestly, my son looks better now. He said my son did not have a good looking nose.

Donald Trump: Now look at it, it's beautiful, it's beautiful. But these doctors at Walter Reed and these Army and Marine and medical doctors. They are unbelievably great people and they see sights that you and I hopefully will never see. They see things that nobody will ever see and there's nobody like them and I have to give a shout out to those people.

Donald Trump: There's nobody like -- So, in the case of Turkey and Syria and the Kurds, we could send in a thousand troops for a military conflict with Turkey. [Unidentified] No, you don't want to do that. We could hit Turkey very hard financially or we could mediate a deal between Turkey and the Kurds. I like that, you know, let's mediate a deal but remember, they've been fighting each other for hundreds of years, and we were artificially put there, in this case, by President Obama.

Donald Trump: So we did our job. We knocked out and I'll tell you another thing. We have to be treated fairly. We have to be treated fairly. We're not treated fairly by other nations. We captured many, many ISIS fighters, most of them came from Europe. They came from Germany, they came from France and came from all of these countries and we called them.

Donald Trump: I call them myself in many cases, I said, take your fighters, they said we don't want them, you take them. I said no, no, no, we did you a big favor. They're citizens of Germany, they're citizens of France, they're citizens of these various countries in Europe, take your fighters. We don't want them, sir.

Donald Trump: We don't want them. And I said, how unfair are we treated? We do them a great favor and they won't take the fighters. So we're doing some things that are pretty amazing and every once in a while you have to change course and do what you have to do. The United States has spent $8 trillion in the Middle East.

Donald Trump: We've lost thousands of brave soldiers and tens of thousands of terribly wounded people, great people, their lives will never be the same. These wars produced only chaos and bloodshed and all of the blood and treasure we sacrificed, made the Middle East less safe, it's really -- it's less safe. It's less stable and it's less secure, and I say it all the time.

Donald Trump: The single greatest mistake our country made in its history was going into the quicksand of the Middle East. We spent $8 trillion and lost thousands of lives, and by the way, the other side, we can talk about that lost millions of lives. What did we do? So we're going to pull them out and we're pulling people out.

Donald Trump: We're trying to make good deals and we're going to bring our soldiers back home, and we may need them for something else, and they'll be ready. Previous administration's lust for regime change and also put historic Christian communities in vastly more danger than they were before we started. They are some of the biggest victims of these power vacuums and reckless foreign adventures, the Christians, the Christians, and we work hard with the Christians.

Donald Trump: We have tremendous evangelical support. We work hard with them. So we're slowly getting out of the Middle East, doing it carefully, and we're rebuilding our military like we have never rebuilt our military before. When I came into office, a very prominent General told me because it looked like we could have a big conflict with some.

Donald Trump: He said, sir, we have no ammunition, we had all planes, we had planes that were so old, they didn't fly. We had people going to the desert, the plane graveyards, airplane graveyards, picking up parts. I'd never want to hear a President of the United States hear those words again. I never want to have a President hear the words, sir, we have no ammunition.

Donald Trump: Think of that. Think of that. Now thanks to more than $2.5 trillion worth of investment in our military, we have more ammunition, more missiles, more rockets, more tanks, more fighter jets, and more of everything else that we've ever had before. And we have no choice. When you look around the world we have no choice, unfortunately.

Donald Trump: And the Democrats wanted to dismantle our military. After years of building up other countries, we are finally building up our country. That's what we have to do. We're replacing the disaster known as NAFTA with the brand new US-Mexico-Canada Agreement. USMCA, a giant victory for our farmers, ranchers, workers in Minnesota.

Donald Trump: Congress should pass the USMCA immediately. We hope that Nancy Pelosi can start thinking about passing some legislation instead of thinking about some nonsense. And to protect our industrial backbone, I placed tariffs on foreign aluminum and foreign steel, and I'm also fighting back against years of chronic trade abuse from China and the supply chain of China, which was unbreakable, is now breaking wide open.

Donald Trump: And they understood it, and I don't blame China for what's taken place over the last 25 years, I blame the people that led our country, that let that happen, where hundreds of billions of dollars a year was taken from our country to build China. Not China's fault. In the previous administration, they put our nation's natural resources under lock and key, including thousands and thousands of acres in a place called Superior National Forest.

Donald Trump: Last year, I traveled to Duluth and announced that we would be ending this injustice, reopening Superior National Forest, and restoring mineral exploration for the iron ore mines of Minnesota, tremendous job. And now the Iron Range is back in business and the last time I was here, a man came up to me and said, sir, President Obama took our heart away, took our life away.

Donald Trump: I'll, never forget it. A man, strong guy, had tears in his eyes. He said you gave us back our life because they took it away from them. We gave it back. Best iron ore there is anywhere. My administration is also fighting the Democrats, Socialist healthcare agenda that would obliterate Medicare. Republicans will protect Medicare and we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions.

Donald Trump: And for those of you that have private healthcare, health insurance, 180 million people, they are going to end it, obliterate it, and most people are thrilled with it. We are going to leave it. You're going to have your plan the way you want it and there's no plan like those. Virtually, every top Democrat also now supports late-term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother's womb right up to the moment of birth.

Donald Trump: And that is why I've asked Congress to prohibit extreme late-term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion socialism, and blatant Washington corruption. The Republican Party is the party of the American worker, the American family, and it's the party of the American dream.

Donald Trump: For years, you watched as your politicians apologized for America. Do you remember that? Gee, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. Now you have a President who is standing up for America, we are standing up for Minneapolis, and we are standing up for the great state of Minnesota. We begin this political campaign with the best record, the best results, the press agenda, and the only positive vision for America.

Donald Trump: We begin this campaign with right now, almost three years of perhaps the most successful administration in the history of our country. Together, we will help millions more citizens from welfare to work, from the pendants to independence and from poverty to prosperity. With your help, we will re-elect and we will elect a Republican Congress to create a safe, modern, fair, and lawful system of immigration.

Donald Trump: We will enact trade deals that ensure more products are proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase Made in the USA. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer, and ending the AIDS epidemic in America within 10 years. Nobody thought that could be done.

Donald Trump: It's going to be done. We will defend privacy, free speech, free assembly, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. And above all, we will never stop fighting for the values that bind us together as one America. We support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement.

Donald Trump: We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we live by the words of our great national motto: In God we Trust. We stand on the shoulders of American patriots who built this country into the greatest nation ever to exist in history.

Donald Trump: Our ancestors crossed the oceans, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, revolutionized industry, pioneered science, won two World Wars, defeated fascism and communism, and put a man on the face of the moon. Proud citizens like the people of Minnesota helped build this country and together we are taking back our country.

Donald Trump: We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion, your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God.

Donald Trump: America is thriving like never before. And ladies and gentlemen of Minnesota, I will tell you this with great certainty. The best is yet to come. [Audience chants "Four more years"] Thank you very much. And just in concluding, together we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again.

Donald Trump: We will make America safe again. And we will Make America Great Again. Thank you, Minnesota. Thank you.
