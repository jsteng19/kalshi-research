Donald Trump: What a nice sound that is, isn't it? What a nice -- please, sit down? Hi, Scott. So I always said that if I ever became president, I would play that all the time no matter where I went in the building, but I've never really gotten to do it. I wanted it for breakfast, lunch and dinner. It's so beautiful.

Donald Trump: Pardon me for being late. We had a great meeting with NATO, the secretary general, and we're going to do something a little different for this country. We're going to supply weapons to NATO at a large amount. They're going to deliver the weapons and they're going to pay for 100 percent of the weapons, so a little different, a little different.

Donald Trump: Hi, John. So that's a big thing. And we thought we had four deals, Howard, right, with Putin. Somehow, they end and we get off the phone, oh, that was a very nice conversation and then he sends missiles into a building someplace. I say, what was that all about? So anyway, so we're going to be doing that with NATO and it's fully approved, fully done.

Donald Trump: And we'll send them a lot of weapons of all kinds, and they're going to deliver those weapons immediately to the site, to the site of the war, different sites of the war, and they're going to pay for 100 percent of them. This all was made possible by going from two to five percent a month ago when I went there.

Donald Trump: Yeah. And those countries, those European countries -- and I said, look, we have an ocean, it's not fair that we did. Because under the Biden administration, we paid about three and a half times more than they did. We were in for $350 billion, got nothing for it. We were in for $350 billion and they were in for $100 billion, which really meant one thing because you have great business leaders here.

Donald Trump: It meant very simply that there were better negotiators than our president was. So this is a very important thing and hopefully that will come to an end. At the end of 50 days, if we don't have a deal, then we're going to have to do -- we have no choice but to do secondary tariffs. You call it secondary tariffs, which are pretty tough, which we don't want to have to do, but let's see what happens.

Donald Trump: But we thought we had a deal numerous times. I'd get home, I'd say, First Lady, I had the most wonderful talk with Vladimir, I think we're finished. And then I'll turn on the television or she'll say to me one time, well, that's strange because they just bombed a nursing home. I said, what? So we don't like that.

Donald Trump: But I want to thank you all for being here and welcome to the first ever White House summit of Faith and Business Leaders. You're really some of the greatest business leaders in the country. When I looked at some of the names, I said, whoa, that's big stuff we have here today. In fact, before I was president, I would have been very intimidated.

Donald Trump: But now I'm president, so I don't have to be. But today we celebrate the core values that built this country and freedom, hard work, risk taking and above all a trust in almighty God. You're very much into God in this room and that's very nice. You're business leaders who believe strongly. We have some business leaders that don't believe strongly.

Donald Trump: And somehow you and I don't like them as much, but I want to thank Pastor Paula White, she's been my friend for a long time, and John for convening this incredible group. Her husband's one of the most talented musicians in the world. Stand up, John, stand up. I stole a couple of his songs for the rallies and he never sued me, so I was very happy.

Donald Trump: But we all come from the same place, right? So it was great and we appreciate it, John. Thanks as well to Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, who's doing a fantastic job. He goes on television and he calms the market. I go on television, I rile the market and I say, we better send him in there, Howard, right?

Donald Trump: And the markets become so calm and nice, so you're doing a good job, Scott, thank you very much. You make any deals today? We got a lot of them, boy, I tell you. We have them, but the best deal is just sending out the paper. You know, they keep saying, well, he hasn't made the deal. Well, we made a number of deals, but why isn't he doing deals?

Donald Trump: Because the paper is better than any deal we can make. Do you understand the people in this? Kevin, they asked you that question this morning. You were great this morning, but they said, well, when is he going to start making deals? The next time we could say just no, every time he sends out a document that you have to pay 35 percent, 25 percent or 50 percent or in one case, 100 percent.

Donald Trump: You can't beat those deals. But we're still willing to talk and literally every country wants to make a deal. We're in a good position, you would call it a position of strength. I don't talk that way because I'm a politician now unfortunately and I don't want to talk about strength. I just want to say we have to be treated fairly because we were treated -- We were ripped off on trade and the military for -- we protected other nations.

Donald Trump: Nobody paid us, nobody did anything for us. Nobody helped us and that's much different. You know, NATO is a much different situation now. When I got in, I believe we were paying for a 100 percent of NATO and now they're paying -- they went from two percent, but they were paying one percent to five percent that they're paying.

Donald Trump: That's a big difference. It's about a trillion, $1 trillion difference and they're wealthy, for the most part, wealthy countries. And some of them, they're among the most powerful among the wealthiest countries in the world. So they're going to start paying and they want to pay and we had a great meeting about one month ago that set the stage for what happened here.

Donald Trump: But it's very important. So I want to thank Scott for being here. I want to thank Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. You are doing a good job, Howard. Am I right when I say I really don't want deals, I just want the paper to get sent, right? It's true. I don't know if this is on television. Yeah, it's always on television.

Donald Trump: SBA administrator and a great person, cabinet member, a friend of mine for a long time, Kelly Loeffler. Kelly, you're doing great. She's small business, right? She only does small business. But when you add it all up, it's the biggest bank in the world by a factor of about 10, right? She's doing a great job.

Donald Trump: And director of the White House faith office, Jenny Corn, who's also amazing. Thanks Jenny. From the earliest days of our republic, the steady compass of faith has guided the strong hands of American workers, builders and entrepreneurs like really no other. Our country was founded by pilgrims and believers and every generation since Americans of faith have built our communities and forged new industries and enriched our country by millions and millions of people and ways.

Donald Trump: John D. Rockefeller, J.C. Penney, Charles Goodyear, Truett Cathy, and frankly, we have people I could name right in this room sitting here that their names are every bit as big as that. They were inspired by their love of God. And now the proud tradition continues with all of you. And this group reminds us as a nation that praise is a nation that prospers and you see that.

Donald Trump: I think one of the reasons we won so bad is they really wanted to take God and religion out of your lives. And there was nobody to look up to. There was just nobody. We were freewheeling and we can't freewheel now we have to bring religion back into the country and we're starting to do that, I think at a very high level, Paula, a very, very high level.

Donald Trump: You see churches are starting to fill up again. Under the Trump administration, America is prospering and America is winning like never before. Our country is back. So I was in Qatar, Saudi Arabia, UAE and then a month ago we were in Europe with all of the NATO countries, European countries and plus Canada and almost everyone said almost the exact same words.

Donald Trump: They said one year ago your country was dead, terrible term but that's what it is. Your country was dead. We thought it was finished and now you've got the hottest country anywhere in the world. It's true. It's the hottest country. Did you see they found $25 billion of essentially profits last night?They said where did it come from, came from management, but it came from tariffs and it came from, you know, good business skill.

Donald Trump: And I've always made money now. I'm now I'm making it for you people I've had good days and bad days, but in good days and bad days, I always found a way to make money and we have to do that for our country. But and we did $188 billion in -- Scott just now. $188 billion in tariffs, $188 billion and we haven't even started yet.

Donald Trump: That's only for cars and steel. We actually have a -- have barely started. The economy is roaring, business confidence is soaring, incomes are up, prices are down and inflation is dead, it's dead. We have a bad FED chairman, really bad. If he would lower the rates -- if he would lower the rates and I tried being nice to the guy, it doesn't help.

Donald Trump: He's like a knucklehead. [Laughter] He's a knucklehead, stupid guy. He really is. You know, each point -- think of this, each point costs us $360 billion, billion, 1.360 billion, two points, you got $600, $700 billion And, uh, we're way high. We're at 450 or 425? 450. And how do you go borrow money at 1 percent when the FED has you at 450 and, you know, it's not that easy.

Donald Trump: I get angry at them, why are we paying so much? You know, because he's got you up at this number and we are the -- we should always be the lowest now that we're -- we're doing great. We have no inflation. Think of it, uh, our stock market hit record highs, everything's hitting a record high. We're really running good with no inflation.

Donald Trump: And we should be -- at one point -- we should be at 1 percent. We should be less than 1 percent. I think Switzerland is the lowest at like one half of a percent. We should be lower because without us there's no world there really, I don't want to sound overly aggressive, but without us you have no world and we put our country on solid footing.

Donald Trump: We had a man as president who was the worst the worst administration, worst president in the history of our country. We've had some bad ones, but he's the worst ever. What he did at our border can never be forgotten. 25 million people allowed to pour into our country, all unchecked, unvetted, murderers, gang leaders, gangsters, people that you don't want in our country under any means.

Donald Trump: Terrorists we have many terrorists in our country and we're watching them close. Tom Homan by the way is doing a phenomenal job. Kristi Noem is doing a phenomenal job and we had last week it was reported nobody, not one even -- I don't know if I believe that number, but the numbers are done by liberals. [Laughter] So they said, did you know that they said we had nobody, zero crossed our border.

Donald Trump: It's the first time that ever happened, zero. Did you hear that? It's like crazy, but we have people from mental institutions, insane asylums, even that's a mental institution on steroids essentially. But we had people coming into our country. We can't have them and we have to get them out, but we can never forgive this administration this past.

Donald Trump: And -- and I'm okay with administrations. I mean, I can go through a Democrat administration say, look, they worked hard, they tried hard. But the things that they did to this country, we can never ever forget it, from the rigged elections to the -- to the border to the transgender from -- for everybody from men playing in women's sport.

Donald Trump: Do you ever take a look at some of these records? There was a long distance race, a marathon where they had a great female runner, a number of them, but they had one in particular and they had just an average male runner who had transitioned. He won the race at the end of the day by five hours and 14 minutes.

Donald Trump: They waited for five hours. The weightlifting records are better though the weightlifting records are better. You know, the way they -- they took a record that hasn't been broken for 18 years -- 18 years and you know they'd add a quarter of an ounce on each side of the barbell and they'd just a little tiny piece of stuff a little to go up and she couldn't get it up and this guy comes along.

Donald Trump: Have you lifted before? Yes, at a low level, he was a low level lifter for as a man but transitioned and he goes up to that thing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing could have done it all day long, broke the record by 119 pounds. [Laughter] The whole thing is crazy. The swimming records are pretty good too.

Donald Trump: You got to see that. I tell the story. You had this great group of young ladies and they grew up with each other because, you know, they sort of swam at the top level and they were swimming and the one girl was seriously injured. She looked left and she saw the same girl. She grew up with Kelly in California, same girls, you know, that young age.

Donald Trump: They sort of rise to the top, she looked to her right, she saw the same girls, but there was this giant standing right next to her and he had transitioned. You probably heard this, he had transitioned and she was never seen her before and when the race was started, he blew by her so fast that she suffered massive wind burn. [Laughter] They had to take her -- that's true and he got out of the race and he had a little lunch and then he came back and watched the rest of the young ladies finish up. The whole thing is crazy and it's so demeaning to women -- it's so demeaning to women, but it is what it is. But what they did to this country, it's -- and we ended all of that.

Donald Trump: As you probably know. We ended the woke -- the woke stuff is no longer in favor, but we're doing fantastically. Wages for blue collar workers have surged by the most in over 60 years. Gas prices have reached the lowest level in five decades. Actually it's going to be -- we're going to see some really good numbers.

Donald Trump: We're, you know, drill, baby, drill, drill, baby, drill. I got to make sure that people can afford to produce the gas, but the gas has gone to the lowest level in decades and you're seeing $1.99, $1.98. And I saw $1.95 at certain states. Not California, because every time it goes down, they add taxes onto you.

Donald Trump: You're at $6, $7, They just add taxes. All they do is they keep adding taxes, terrible governor doesn't know what he's doing. He may be -- he may be a candidate, but if you -- if you go by success, you can't have him be a candidate. And on Friday, it was announced that the United States Treasury ran a budget surplus.

Donald Trump: Is that true, Scott? In June for the first time in many, many decades? Wow, I didn't know that. That's a good one too. I'm going to have to put that in my repertoire, Scott. [Laughter] But the biggest victory of all came ten days ago when I signed the one big beautiful bill into law. All right. And just as I promised we, uh, we did something that was amazing.

Donald Trump: You know, we were -- everybody was against it. I wanted it. I know Scott and Howard like the idea of it too, but it was very risky because they've never done any thing like it in terms of the -- it's the biggest bill ever passed of its kind ever passed by far. And they were going to cut it into two or three or even as many as seven bills.

Donald Trump: And I said the problem is that in the one big bill, everybody gets something when you cut it into sevens, there are four or five of them or three of them, right, Kevin, that you get nothing. All they're going to do is fight it. You'll never get them passed. And so we went with it, I was on -- I was on a show called Deface the Nation.

Donald Trump: Have you heard of it? [Laughter] They're so bad -- they're so bad these people, they're so average. But I was on the show Deface the Nation ladies and gentlemen, President Donald J. Trump on Deface the Nation. [Laughter] No, but they're all so bad, but -- but we were on the show and she said to me a question.

Donald Trump: She said, uh, what would you call this bill? Would you want to have it called, uh, One Big Beautiful or would you rather see it? I said what I want is one great big, beautiful bill and Speaker Mike Johnson, John Thune they were watching and they said what a great name for the bill. We actually ended up calling it that.

Donald Trump: We took the great out. I actually liked it even better. One great, big beautiful. But they said, look, a little bit of a low key, but we got it passed. But we got it passed because there's something for everybody and there are things that people don't like, but you need them for the country. You know, you have to do some things that are great for the country, but they wouldn't necessarily get the votes, and we got the votes.

Donald Trump: Think of it, not one Democrat vote. All the goodies that we got, not one Democrat voted in either the Senate or the House and we're talking about tax cuts and business. I mean, so many different things that are so good, right, not one Democrat vote would want with us, not one. So we had to get almost every in the House.

Donald Trump: We got 218 to 2. Think of that, 218 to 2. Nobody could do that. It's never been done and that says -- and we have Rand Paul Junior, who's a guy from -- we call him Rand Paul Junior because he always votes no, a guy named Massie, always votes no. We had another guy who I helped, very, very strongly helped him with a very personal situation, got him through it, and he voted no. I said, thank you very much, I appreciate it. And then we went to the Senate and you had of course Rand Paul, who always votes no. And they call him just say no. I think they think it's -- no, I think they think -- And I got him elected.

Donald Trump: I had to go to Kentucky twice to do rallies to get him elected twice, but they forget. A lot of politicians forget and we had a couple of others. Susan Collins, she's another one, just say no. She was brutal, brutal. And we had some people, Tillis, I guess was a no, right? He was a no and they said he was brave, he said no to the president, but he resigned the following morning.

Donald Trump: So anyway, that was terrible, I thought, but we couldn't lose more than three. And we had three that said, no. And so we one that 50 to 3, so it's pretty close. And a senator came over to me and said, I can't believe you won the House. Great guy, this guy, this Senator Eric Schmidt, who's doing a great job.

Donald Trump: He said, I can't believe you won the House. I said actually, so remember 218 to 2. We needed three, so we could have lost three. We actually only lost two. I said, no, actually the Senate was tougher than the House of the two. That questions asked to me, who was tougher? I'd say the Senate was tougher actually, amazingly.

Donald Trump: It shouldn't have been. We had a slightly bigger margin in the Senate proportionately, but it was brutal. It was -- they said, sir, we have 12 hard nos. you know, a hard no is not recoverable, right? This was at 2:30 in the morning. Mike Johnson called up, it could be 20, but it's at least 12. So could you call them, sir?

Donald Trump: I said, what time is it, 2:30 in the morning. And we have to win, right? We can never give up. The people in this room, right? You never gave up. My supporter right from day one and her husband with a bad damn back, right? How's his back? Is he OK? Every time I see him, he's got a bad back, but he's got a lot of cash.

Donald Trump: A lot, he's got a lot of cash. But no, they're great people. Thank you very much. I do appreciate you. You were there right at the beginning, always was there. So we have a situation where we call up these people at 2:30 in the morning and I called up -- I got along with them all great. I liked them, but they're tough.

Donald Trump: You know, they're Congressmen. When you're a Congressman for 20 years or you're a senator for years, you're smart and you're a survivor because you go through all sorts of hell. But I called up Congressman and I said, Jim, hi, Jim, how are you doing? He said, fine, sir. I said, family is good, yeah. He said, sir, you have my vote.

Donald Trump: I never said what I was talking about. I said, I do, thank you very much, but how do you know what I'm calling you about? He said, sir, I've been your friend for two and a half years, you've never called me during normal hours. So I assume that if you're calling me at 2:30 in the morning, you're not calling me to ask me, how's the family doing?

Donald Trump: I said, yeah, that's true. It's pretty good. So I called up everyone. I think everyone with the exception of one, I had to speak a little bit, but I call up, sir, you have my vote. Thank you. Sir, you have my vote. Think of that. And we got 12 votes in a matter of -- I called back 20 minutes later. I said, you got all the votes.

Donald Trump: That's spirit, right, That's spirit. They wanted to maybe hear they wanted to have a little love. You know, the sad part is that some of the best people are the people that don't get any publicity because they go with something because it's good. So a guy like some of the people I'm talking about, but some of the people where you didn't even have to call, they vote yes, 100 percent.

Donald Trump: You don't have to waste any time with them. You don't have to beg them, come on, you can do it. Come on, let's have lunch, let's have dinner and then you have other guys they want you to suffer. I mean, some of these people that I just mentioned whose names I just mentioned, you got to go through hell. And the ones that are really good and they love the country and they're doing right, I mean, what's the alternative.

Donald Trump: You know, the alternative here, you're getting the biggest tax cut in history. And with the Democrats, you're going to have the biggest tax increase in history. Now we could go into 100 other details, they're equally as crazy. So I said, so what's the difference? So you're going to say no. And you're going to have the biggest tax cut in history this way and you're going to have the biggest tax increase the other way.

Donald Trump: And you'll probably end up in a depression because if you ever did that, it would be a shock to the whole world. That's what happened in 1929. I said, so you're going to vote for the other side? Well, sir, I'll do what's really appropriate. You know, the losers, but you have that. Really, they're grandstanders.

Donald Trump: You have grandstanders and you have in every business and the Democrat has far fewer. They have grandstanders. But you know, the one thing about them, they have bad policy, they're evil people in many ways, but they stick together. You don't have it where you don't have -- I don't want to use too many names, but you don't have a Mitt Romney in the midst who makes you suffer.

Donald Trump: You don't have some of the people that I mentioned who make it so hard. They make it so hard. And the alternative is one of two things. You can either get all these things and make the economy strong or you're going to literally have, perhaps, a depression where you people so rich, so beautiful so nice to look at, will be totally busted.

Donald Trump: And let's see how long your wife stays with you. You're beautiful. She'll stay with you for about three weeks and she'll say, darling, I can't take it anymore. I can't take it anymore, darling, I'm leaving you. I said to one guy, he's a very, very unattractive man but he's smart and he's rich and I said, you better hope we get this thing passed because your wife will be gone within about two minutes.

Donald Trump: He said, you're right. So we had a tremendous success and it gives you the biggest tax cut in American history, the largest spending cut in American history and the largest border security investment of all time. And again, we're doing great on the border. I almost say why do we need it? We have such good numbers, but you need it. Ultimately, you're going to need it. I built hundreds of miles of border wall.

Donald Trump: Without that, you could have never had the results that we had. But to lift up the American family, we increased the child tax credit and made school permanent. We made it all permanent, the school choice and we expanded school choice. And for every newborn child, we created what's called the Trump accounts.

Donald Trump: And this was Michael Dell. I don't know if Michael Dell is here, but Michael Dell -- well, you tell him, I mentioned his name because he would call me for three or four years. I didn't know Michael, I just know he's a great success story and a great guy. That's all he talked about, was the account where you put $1,000 in as a baby is born $1,000 into an account and you let it be invested by, I guess you pick out some good money, determinant or fund or index.

Donald Trump: And I guess, at a certain age like when they're 30, goes earlier than that, but when they're 30, they're supposed to have like $75,000. That would have a huge impact on their lives, and it could even be more than that. So that passed and you know it's funny that was one of the easiest things we had to get passed.

Donald Trump: Can you believe it? I thought so many people loved it, they actually call it the Trump accounts and I didn't fight for that name, right? I didn't fight for that. I said, that's a very great honor. But Michael Dell was amazing, that's what he -- and he's going to put -- he said he's going to invest billions of dollars doing it for children.

Donald Trump: He's going to put a lot of his money into it. But even more importantly than the economic success we're restoring the spirit of our country. America is once again an optimistic nation. We were so down, it was depressing. We were so down. That's why I ran again. I got cheated and they rigged the election. But I said, if I didn't think I won, I would have never run because that's like a poll, right?

Donald Trump: You lose, you lose. It's worse than a poll. But I saw the lack of spirit in this country. For four years, it was a dark horrible place. And for people of religion, they were arresting your pastors, they were arresting if you went to church and you had a service outside and the reason outside because you had the COVID and you could go outside to arrest everybody for even having the service.

Donald Trump: I'll tell you, religion took a big hit because of the way they treated all of us and, uh, we now have a confident nation, an optimistic nation and we have one nation under God and we'll always keep that term. And we're bringing back very importantly and not just evangelicals or Protestants or this all religions.

Donald Trump: We're bringing them back into our country. As president, I've ended the radical left war on faith and we're once again protecting religious freedom like never before in our country. We're protecting it like never before. We're getting rid of the Johnson Amendment that didn't let the pastors and ministers and everybody speak about politics.

Donald Trump: Now you're able to speak about politics, Paula, you can speak about it. You can say, I don't like that guy and they don't take away your tax exempt status. You know, they take away tax exempt and I'll tell you remember when that started? It was at the meeting room before I ran 2015 a year before the election and I was with 50 faith leaders.

Donald Trump: They were great, very well known people, mostly Protestant, but you had rabbis, you had an imam, two imams and we were talking and I said, I'd love to have your endorsement and they looked at me like what I'd love to have your endorsement. We have such respect for you and you're, you know, you control a really very powerful.

Donald Trump: And they looked at me, they didn't say anything. Do you remember that? And I said what's wrong with these people, I didn't know about the Johnson Amendment. Don't forget I never did this stuff before. You know it wasn't like I ran. I was on the other side. I was on the same side as you -- you're right, contributions to people that you like.

Donald Trump: But I never ran, so I didn't know about the Johnson Amendment and I called Paula and Jenny aside, I said, could I ask you when I said I'd want your, you know, support, your political support and endorsement. They looked at me like -- they looked at me very weird, what's going on? Well, sir, there's a thing called the Johnson Amendment.

Donald Trump: And if they even speak about anything having to do with politics, they will immediately take away their tax exempt status and if they lose their tax exempt status in your world, that means you might as well close up your church. I said you got to be kidding. So I can't really -- and I told them we had another meeting a couple of months later and I said, you know, you people in theory are the most powerful people.

Donald Trump: You're more powerful than man or woman because we have more than 50, Let's assume men and women are 5050, but you have 80 percent between all the different religions I said you have more power than anybody, but you're not allowed to use your power. I said we're going to get rid of that because people want to hear what you have to say more than anybody else.

Donald Trump: Pretty much and we did get rid of it and we launched something that's great. And now you see people, if they like somebody, they're able to talk about that. Somebody for office. Right, Jenny? We're able to talk about a certain politician that has your values and likes your religion, it's okay and we got rid -- that was Lyndon Johnson, a very powerful guy and he had a problem with a pastor I think in Houston and the pastor was not a fan of his and he -- he put the clamps on the guy.

Donald Trump: He really did amazing actually and, uh, we opened it up. I looked at him and we were up at 68 stories in the air at Trump Tower. And this beautiful conference room, I look down, I see people walking up and down the street. I said that means that that person walking up and down the street, any one of them have more power than you do because you're not allowed to even talk about it. You're even afraid to talk about it, but they're not afraid any longer and I think they appreciate it. As president.

Donald Trump: I've ended the radical left war on faith and we're once again protecting religious freedom instead of destroying it and God is once again welcomed back into our public square. It's very important. And I stopped the Biden administration's persecutions of Christians and pro-life activists. They would put people in jail if they even uttered the word and well look at me. I mean, look what happened to me, I was under investigation more than the late great Alphonse Capone.

Donald Trump: Think of it. Al Capone would kill people for dinner. If he left the room and he didn't like them, he'd have them shot killed, buried under a building someplace as part of the foundation of a building. They're all over the place. And I said I had more time under investigation than the legendary Alphonse Capone or probably anybody else I had -- but I had a lot of good people with me and most importantly, I had the base with me at a level that it actually became stronger.

Donald Trump: The one thing I did that was very helpful. I was indicted five times. Think of that. Indicted. That wasn't a word that was in my father's looking down, my mother's looking down that my son's not supposed to be indicted, is he? I got indicted five times impeached. Two times, all bullshit, right, all bull. Terrible stuff and I got impeached for making a perfect phone call.

Donald Trump: A congratulatory -- good luck. Congratulations. I had a guy come up to me, a secretary, a secretary of Energy from before. Sir, could you call up, of all people, President Zelenskyy. And I called him. I actually held off, he must have come ten times. Please, sir, it's because they wanted to do business or something, oil and gas who the hell knows what they wanted, You can imagine what they wanted, but they wanted would you call President Zelenskyy And I did when I finally got him, I said congratulations on your win.

Donald Trump: He had just one. This is early in the process. Should have never been -- that war should have never taken place by the way. If -- if the election weren't rigged, that war would never be happening right now. Millions of people being killed. That war would never be happening, but would you call up I say hello, President, how are we doing?

Donald Trump: Everything good? Good. Congratulations on your big victory, wonderful job, great, great, great. Hang up. That's it. I get indicted for making a phone call, I told that secretary who wasn't the smartest bulb, he wasn't -- uh, Rick Perry, you don't want him on your debate team let me put it that way. Rick, you're not going to be on my debate team, Rick.

Donald Trump: But he's the one that asked me to do it, Rick Perry and I said thanks, Rick. That was a wonderful suggestion. He just got indicted over your stupid call. This is what we have to put up with, right? This is what we have to do. We have to put up with things, but it's been, uh, it's been an amazing -- it's been an amazing period of time.

Donald Trump: And we've straightened out so many bad things in this country. I created a Presidential Commission on Religious Liberty and established the Department of Justice Task Force to eradicate anti-Christian bias because you have a very big anti-Christian bias that you don't think about. And you don't hear about it, I established the White House faith office to defend and represent people of all faiths and it's located in the White House.

Donald Trump: You've never had an office. You've never had that and Jenny and Paula are there all the time. But we have it in the White House so people can call up and complain or they can call up and say you're doing a great job whatever. But we have it actually in the White House with no, nobody's ever done that. We've restored the fundamental principle that God created two genders, male and female.

Donald Trump: That was a tough one. That was tough and we're defending parents rights where the parents rights have been taken away from them in schools. You look at some of these school boards, it's like they're brutal dictatorships and we brought it all back. The parents have the control now and last Monday we effectively eliminated the infamous, as I said, Johnson amendment such a big deal and various other amendments and things that really took away your free speech.

Donald Trump: That's what they've done. They've taken away free speech. I also want to recognize the incredible contribution of our great First Lady Melania. And she says hello and Melania did the Be Best initiative in supporting children in our foster care system. She visits a lot of children a lot. Yesterday, we went to the game at the soccer game.

Donald Trump: I don't know if you saw it in the Meadowlands. It was incredible and she's always thinking about the children that have a hard time and helping America's young people reach their fullest potential. And it's remarkable to think that it was only one year ago this week that my time on earth nearly ended and if you look at that, God was with me because that's something that in theory I should not -- I should not be with you today.

Donald Trump: Thank you. Well, I believe that and I do, I believe it that my life was saved by God to really make America great. Again, I really believe that. I think, uh, I have a son. He's a great shooter like a championship shooter. Don and Eric was a great shooter. Both of them. But they said that at that distance with that gun, uh, you didn't have a chance.

Donald Trump: And we, uh, turned the head at the right time, didn't we, huh? We turned the head at the right time. So I don't know. Some people say it was lucky and some people say something else. I say something else, I think God helped us. So I always believed in giving back to this nation, a nation that we love so much and I know that everyone lives by that same sacred principle.

Donald Trump: The people in this room do, I can tell you. I hate when I see complainers, people that complain and they don't do anything about it, like in many cases, the media, not all of the media. I mean, I must add something because we won in a landslide. Think of it, we won every swing state. We won by millions of votes.

Donald Trump: We won the popular vote. We won -- there's a district vote that's very interesting. It's where the whole map looks red, red for Republican, by the way. But the whole map came out, I think it was 2,750 to 505. Think of that, that's broken into little districts, little areas. We had an unbelievable election.

Donald Trump: And so I don't know. Somebody said, how do you win without the press, but we have a hidden press and the real hidden press and the hidden vote is the people and the word of mouth. Word of mouth is more important than the press and they see what we do and they see how we do it. I want to thank all of you and your great communities.

Donald Trump: And you know, just it's a blessing to our country that you're here and a blessing to our country that you become so successful. And so great and people look up to you, have no idea. You don't know. We take things for granted. You don't know. The people in this room are amazing. I even, looking at that list, I really said that's something that's something great.

Donald Trump: And you're all believers. I think, Paula, you wouldn't have invited people that -- is there an atheist in the room? Any atheists? I don't think so. I wouldn't want to raise my hand if I were you. I'd be in big trouble now. No, you invited all people that are outstanding in faith and success. And it's a very noble group, but it's because of the patriotism and goodwill of citizens like you that America remains strong and faithful and free.

Donald Trump: And together, we're going to continue the fight for Judeo-Christian values of our Founding fathers. We'll grow our economy. We'll defend our sovereignty. We'll protect our children. When you look at the job we did, I was just thinking because President Putin said it to me and other leaders said it to me, when they looked at those B-2s go in -- and think of it, they flew for 37 hours straight.

Donald Trump: We had 52 tankers, tankers, the gasoline tankers and they rode along with them at different aspects and they refueled. And not a screw was broken, not a mark was on those planes. Every engine was perfect. When they landed, they were just as good as when they took off. Think of that, 37 hours and about 40 minutes to a very rough territory, and those machines worked incredibly well and literally not a problem.

Donald Trump: And when I honored the fliers, we did it last week, I also honored the mechanics, the people that took care of those machines. And I said, it's equally important. And you compare that -- same country, you compare that with what happened with Jimmy Carter, it was a sad situation. The helicopters were coming down and they were crashing and the men were all over the place trying to get the hell out of there.

Donald Trump: And it turned out to be a hostage situation and a horrible thing and it was one of the things that cost him the election, certainly. But when you think of that and you see this was -- in terms of perfection, they think it was a perfect military. We sent the planes to Guam, everybody thought we were flying to Guam.

Donald Trump: And they said, oh, they're going to Guam. Well, Guam is out of the way. And at the same time, we had some others going in a different direction. I watched horrible, horrible CNN -- you know, you have to watch sometimes your opposition and they are opposition. And I saw that they had basically the plans of when we're going in, when we would be entering Iranian oil airspace.

Donald Trump: And I said, you know, that's weird. And I called the General Razin Caine, he's fantastic. I said, General and Pete Hegseth, I said, I'm watching newscasts where they're saying what time you're taking off tomorrow and what time we're going to be entering the very dangerous airspace, the worst air space anywhere there is, anywhere in the world.

Donald Trump: I said, what do you think? Sir, we'll be fine. We blow them away. We'll be fine, because they want those B-2s. We had seven, and they were surrounded by a lot of great planes, F-22s the most beautiful plane ever built, the fighter jet F-35s. They had a lot of different planes going with them. I said, but wouldn't a surprise be better.

Donald Trump: Yeah, it would be better. I said, well, then let me cancel it and let's make it at a different time. So the day before, I canceled it. I canceled it. I said, I'm canceling it. We'll do it sometime within the next two, maybe three weeks. But I'm canceling it and then I had a meeting and I said, I have an idea because I got slightly big coverage to put it mildly.

Donald Trump: So everyone knew it was being canceled. I said let's leave at the exact same time we were supposed to leave the following day and we took off. And that's when the planes went out to Guam and this and that and we took off. And that was the only time, and they said it, that was the only time they knew we wouldn't be coming in, was the exact same time that I -- I said, let's do something.

Donald Trump: And they flew in and they were stealth, incredible planes. They were stealth and they hit, every bomb hit their mark. Every single bomb hit the mark. It was unbelievable how they did it. And then they said, skidaddle. Skidaddle means get the hell out of there. They had to get out of that airspace, but it was an amazing thing and I think it was so great for our country in so many different ways.

Donald Trump: You know, you see so many incompetent people like the way we left Afghanistan with Milley and all these incompetent, stupid people and Biden. I mean, it was him. Leave everything behind, leave jets behind. I said to Milley, I said, so you mean to tell me -- because I was going to leave. We would have left earlier than them, but we were going to leave with dignity and strength.

Donald Trump: I said to Milley, you mean you want to leave a jet fighter behind, sir, It's cheaper if we do that. I said, wait a minute, give me a tank of gas and I'll fly it to Pakistan or I'll fly it to someplace or I'll fly it back home. Why is it cheap? Oh, it's just cheaper. That's when I realized the guy was grossly incompetent.

Donald Trump: OK? He's telling me it's cheaper to leave a plane than it is to -- the planes cost $150 million a piece. Let's leave it, sir. It's just great and they did, they left. I was taking everything but they left it behind. But when you look at what happened and compare that to what we have now, we have a real great machine.

Donald Trump: I rebuilt the military in my first term and we left some of it to Afghanistan and the Taliban and they have their parades. I hate those parades. Every year they have a parade wheeling down our equipment on some very unattractive street that's their Fifth Avenue. They show our equipment going down, just it's getting older and older.

Donald Trump: But I hate to see it. But we're going to be working together to protect our children and with the grace of God and the blessing of providence, we will lead our country to heights that it's never seen before. I think we're going to be more successful in many ways, but I think we're going to be more successful than we've ever been.

Donald Trump: And I do think this, if we didn't catch it, if we would have lost this election, our country was finished. I think it was. We were run by incompetent people. We were run by an autopen that nobody knows who used it. I think it's one of the biggest scandals in the history of our country. We were run by an auto pen.

Donald Trump: Nobody has any idea who used it, including Biden. He doesn't know. I saw that interview yesterday. He said he knew nothing. So it's a very terrible -- we're against an evil group of people and they're very smart, very smart. He's not but they are. They took over the Oval Office. They actually took over the Oval Office.

Donald Trump: We can never let a thing like that happen again. So Paul, I want to thank you very much and I want to thank Jenny. And most importantly, I want to thank the people in this room. You really are incredible people, an inspiration to our country. And I know you don't know that, you don't think it because you're too busy working, but you are.

Donald Trump: You're a great inspiration to young people that want to be just like you when they grow up. And thank you very much for being here and it's a great honor. And Paula, I think you're going to say a prayer. I'll stay with you while you say your prayer. OK? Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much.
