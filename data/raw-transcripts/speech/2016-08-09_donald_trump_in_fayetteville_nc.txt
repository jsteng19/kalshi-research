Donald Trump: and I've gotten to know so many people doing this and one but somebody said

Donald Trump: before you know you should mention some of the people ben Carson such an

Donald Trump: incredible guy

Donald Trump: great

Donald Trump: he's a great person great human being and some of the people that in all

Donald Trump: fairness you know we had 17 people some of the people i ran against they got to

Donald Trump: know him and they're good i didn't treat him very nicely but that's ok you know

Donald Trump: that's all but we're gonna bring a lot of the people that you know a lot of

Donald Trump: people that you respect and we're going to do it based on talent based on all of

Donald Trump: the things that we need for the different positions we have such talent

Donald Trump: in this country we're not using it

Donald Trump: we're just not using it such incredible talent and speaking of talent

Donald Trump: so what's with this voter ID in north carolina right

Donald Trump: what's with this

Donald Trump: you know I keep talking about rigged system i watch Bernie Sanders work work

Donald Trump: work for old burning he's working working working and i said i think the

Donald Trump: system's rigged you know the super-delegates what happened to Bernie

Donald Trump: where is you what happened but we're gonna get a lot of Bernie voters I think

Donald Trump: we really well because I talk about trade and I've been talking about it for

Donald Trump: years many years before i was doing this have been doing this for like what 15

Donald Trump: months now

Donald Trump: before long before I was doing this I was talking about trade and what a

Donald Trump: disgusting situation it is for our country you know that two days ago I met

Donald Trump: a supporter and he's in the tile business great guy but he said his

Donald Trump: business is being decimated by foreign countries with a make tile and the

Donald Trump: towels not nearly as good and he can't send his tile to those countries because

Donald Trump: there's a 27-percent tax and it's very tough but they can send their stuff in

Donald Trump: here and there stuff by the way is not as good as what this man makes and you

Donald Trump: know the trade thing it's all like we talked about free trade and I want trade

Donald Trump: and i'm not in isolation is by the way i want free trade but i wanted to be great

Donald Trump: trade for our country

Donald Trump: it's got to be a two-way street it's got to be a to waste and it will be a

Donald Trump: two-way street again it will be a two-way street but he was telling me how

Donald Trump: impossible it was for him in this case it was China but it's really almost

Donald Trump: everybody how impossible it was for him to do business in China and not for long

Donald Trump: and will do business in China we're going to do business in China but we're

Donald Trump: going to do it on an equal footing right now they can dump their product and you

Donald Trump: know what i'm talking about the steel they dump and I think they dumped it to

Donald Trump: put our steel companies out of business so that we have to go to China to buy

Donald Trump: the stuff and you know what

Donald Trump: not gonna happen anymore folks it's not going to happen anyway

Donald Trump: and if you think Hillary Clinton knows anything about it number one I know

Donald Trump: about it but even if she did it wouldn't matter because she's controlled by her

Donald Trump: donors and her special interests

Donald Trump: totally controlled by her donors and special interest so if she knew it

Donald Trump: wouldn't make any difference wouldn't make any difference whatsoever so we're

Donald Trump: going to bring back our trade you know somebody said to me what's the most

Donald Trump: important well there's so many things we got a repeal Obamacare replace it we

Donald Trump: gotta have strong borders at me there's so many things you can go on and on and

Donald Trump: on he could stand here for three days we can tell you what's wrong and so many of

Donald Trump: these things are so easy to fix one of the things that amazes me when I talk

Donald Trump: about trade I want to trade i think it's good

Donald Trump: the concept of trip it's got to be fair but here's the thing i say i'm going to

Donald Trump: renegotiate NAFTA which is a disaster right by the way in North Carolina and

Donald Trump: virtually every other place in all fairness but they have ripped businesses

Donald Trump: from your guts

Donald Trump: they've taken businesses out of this state out of Ohio out of michigan

Donald Trump: michigan has just been decimated by after the auto plans you've got to see

Donald Trump: what they're building in Mexico they are building some of the greatest biggest

Donald Trump: most modern plants in the world for cars for computers for everything and you

Donald Trump: know what folks I think that's fine but we're not going to help them

Donald Trump: we're going to fight for ourselves we're gonna have a policy very simple America

Donald Trump: first remember that America

Donald Trump: so we have essentially two people running and Hillary made it through a

Donald Trump: small field I made it through a large field and she got through I got through

Donald Trump: we're stuck with each other just fine and I'll tell you what if you knew where

Donald Trump: she stood on the 2nd amendment on the raising which you basically wants to

Donald Trump: take your safety way she wants to take your guns away and by the way if she

Donald Trump: appoints Supreme Court justices meeting if she gets the option to a point

Donald Trump: meaning a very sad day in this country because if she became president should

Donald Trump: do a terrible job this would be four more years of obama and we don't want

Donald Trump: four more years of Obama we don't want Isis we don't want regulations we don't

Donald Trump: want high taxes all of these things would would be an extension this would

Donald Trump: be an extension a four-year extension of obama and i think in many ways it maybe

Donald Trump: end up being worse so if she gets to a point Supreme Court justices you know

Donald Trump: the next president will appoint probably three but it could even be four or five

Donald Trump: that's the way the cards for will be a record setting number possibly and we

Donald Trump: had judge Kelly as an example that was supposed to be Justice Scalia was

Donald Trump: supposed to be there for a lot longer and that he was taken from us and he was

Donald Trump: a great guy and we are going to appoint justices you know I named 11 people that

Donald Trump: are highly highly vented highly vented heritage and different people and gone

Donald Trump: through different people that I respect conservative people smart people and

Donald Trump: very importantly and the wheel standard if we could find as close to Justice

Donald Trump: Scalia because he was a terrific United States

Donald Trump: Supreme Court change now if on the other hand if Hillary points if Hillary points

Donald Trump: justices of the Supreme Court you can have a lot of problems folks you can

Donald Trump: have a lot of problems because you know if they're on the court for 20 or 25

Donald Trump: years and you have four of them let's say or three of them or five of them

Donald Trump: I mean we've gone for like what 75 years meaning we're gone as a country because

Donald Trump: we will be a large scale version of Venezuela that's what's gonna happen and

Donald Trump: you see what's happening in vent as well so we can't let it happen

Donald Trump: we can't let it happen now just a couple of things and I wrote these down a week

Donald Trump: ago and I've said it and I mean it but I said unstable Hillary Clinton lacks the

Donald Trump: judgment remember when Bernie Sanders talked about judgment he said she has

Donald Trump: bad judgment

Donald Trump: now what he said it nobody picked it up and when I say it nobody picks it up

Donald Trump: either because you can't say a bad because the press will never pick up

Donald Trump: anything that's correct or accurate or bad about it now it's such it is such a

Donald Trump: double standard but Bernie Sanders said that Hillary Clinton had bad judgment

Donald Trump: and he said it many times and he said it over and over and then I think he was

Donald Trump: really asked not to say that anymore and he stopped because they were perhaps

Donald Trump: more civil that we were in our site we would never stop but she's bad judgment

Donald Trump: her temperament a word she uses all the time is terrible

Donald Trump: it's a loser's temperament she's got the temperament of a loser i have the

Donald Trump: temperament of a winner and we have to win again

Donald Trump: we have to win

Donald Trump: she said about me not so long ago my tone she said I don't like two tone t.o

Donald Trump: n.e I don't like the tone of Donald Trump now in the Middle East they're

Donald Trump: chopping off heads they're drowning people in steel cages they're burying

Donald Trump: people in the sand and she doesn't like my tone I think it's time maybe for a

Donald Trump: little tougher tone folks you know no time for

Donald Trump: so the bad judgment alone you can't pick a hill look whether you look at Libya

Donald Trump: you look at Syria you take a look at the migration take a look at this

Donald Trump: she wants to put and I said five hundred percent and the press that I was wrong

Donald Trump: it wasn't the right number five hundred percent more people coming in from Syria

Donald Trump: we don't know who they are where they come from

Donald Trump: she wants and I said five hundred percent more than President Obama and

Donald Trump: he's got a pouring in right and the press that I was wrong you know what the

Donald Trump: real number was 550 percent i couldn't believe it i was on the low side that

Donald Trump: was on the low side 550 percent more than we have coming in right now and you

Donald Trump: know what this is going to be in my opinion and I've been pretty right of

Donald Trump: these things I said don't go into Iraq was right about it i said and by the way

Donald Trump: once we were in Iraq getting out the way Obama got out cause problems that are

Donald Trump: going to be very hard to solve

Donald Trump: i said 'i reparable what they have done what they have done in terms of getting

Donald Trump: out of Iraq Isis comes about you know i said before also in North Carolina I

Donald Trump: said that if they gave a trophy for the most valuable player you call it in

Donald Trump: sports most pack valuable player award the winner of the trophy for Isis would

Donald Trump: probably have to be Hillary click right Hilary clone

Donald Trump: and now she's gonna tell you how to get rid of Isis she's gonna tell you how

Donald Trump: cause her and Obama and I guarantee you that if Obama had the choice to do again

Donald Trump: now you have to go and play the game but if he had the choice to do again for

Donald Trump: Secretary of State and if he knew what took place in the Middle East and other

Donald Trump: places i guarantee you he would never have picked Hillary Clinton he would

Donald Trump: never picked her he would not have gone that way now you're not going to hear

Donald Trump: that i'm sure he tells that to his wife but it's about it because he can't but

Donald Trump: that's the way it is

Donald Trump: Shoshi she is just a person that if she's president we're gonna have

Donald Trump: problems like you've never had before she talks about toughness with Russia

Donald Trump: wouldn't it be nice if we actually got along with people will not be a nice

Donald Trump: thing

Donald Trump: ok you know Russia is a nuclear nation has nuclear weapons you know she's tough

Donald Trump: they talk about Crimea i answered a question perfectly they were talking

Donald Trump: about Russian what I would do with Ukraine and Russia but you know by the

Donald Trump: time this is now taking place

Donald Trump: Crimea is already a part of Russia essentially right and this happened on

Donald Trump: Obama's watch so they put out a thing about me I didn't know foreign policy i

Donald Trump: didn't know foreign policy

Donald Trump: why did you let Crimea go to Russia they don't want to mention this they don't

Donald Trump: want to mention the fact that when i was asked about NATO that I said look NATO's

Donald Trump: obsolete now i'm not an expert on NATO but I have a lot of common sense i have

Donald Trump: great business sense i made a lot of money and I had great success

Donald Trump: but but you know what built a great great company far greater than anybody

Donald Trump: even understands but but you know what I said

Donald Trump: NATO's absolutely and they all smiled and laughed Oh Donald Trump he said it's

Donald Trump: obsolete

Donald Trump: don't forget this was done for the Soviet Union many many many years ago

Donald Trump: now let's say Russia tough so it's ok for Russia to right let's say it's fine

Donald Trump: but this was done originally for the Soviet Union it morphs into Russia

Donald Trump: that's fine but we have a new threat it's called terrorism and then not

Donald Trump: equipped for terrorism they don't even have the right countries for terrorism

Donald Trump: and i said this actually to Wolf Blitzer CNN but I said this and people smiled

Donald Trump: how that that funny isn't that funny

Donald Trump: three days later they start saying Trump is right it's really obsolete you know

Donald Trump: you ever hear the expression you can't see the forest for the trees right right

Donald Trump: you can't see the forest for the trees you guys good people they study need to

Donald Trump: this so close they're so close that they can't see what's going on

Donald Trump: so all of a sudden 34 days later somebody came out that your truck's got

Donald Trump: a point and then a couple of months ago on the wall street journal of the front

Donald Trump: page I read because I said terrorism it's absolutely because it's not

Donald Trump: covering terrorism the way it should be and then all of a sudden i read a big

Donald Trump: story from picture of the wall street journal Nate out to develop terrorism

Donald Trump: division

Donald Trump: and I was only mentioned like 18 of one sense that I essentially wasn't happy

Donald Trump: they could give me a little more credit but that saturday the credit I want our

Donald Trump: country to be great again that's what i really want that's what

Donald Trump: but then I said a second thing with them i said a second thing thank you thank

Donald Trump: you very much i said a second thing within I said we have too many countries

Donald Trump: that are paying their way because i had heard it and I don't study it i mean

Donald Trump: that NATO was aight i'll tell you what when I was asked a question about NATO I

Donald Trump: give you my word it's not I you know I'm a business guy in in my whole life I was

Donald Trump: never asked about NATO right but I gave a great answer and they've actually

Donald Trump: changed NATO because of what i said ok now it's not because of what i said

Donald Trump: because of what we said you know folks just so you know something we have a

Donald Trump: movement going on here

Donald Trump: this is a movement this is

Donald Trump: this is a real great movement this is a beautiful thing to watch no matter where

Donald Trump: we go the crowds the enthusiasm I mean this thing we started today

Donald Trump: here I said let's stop there it's great i have a friend that lives in the area I

Donald Trump: why i love the world and and we're gonna take care of the military

Donald Trump: we're going to take care of the military you know I have to say I'm in a lot of

Donald Trump: businesses but i'm in the real estate business primarily and i get so many

Donald Trump: listings of military bases this one's for sale that one's and at one point few

Donald Trump: years ago I said wow how many bases can we sell you know they're getting rid of

Donald Trump: so many places in so many bases and you know the one thing i'm a big believer in

Donald Trump: cutting and we can do a lot of cutting and a lot of pruning and have things be

Donald Trump: better look at the VA as an example how badly run is the VA how badly run is the

Donald Trump: VA and yet it's like a corrupt enterprise but how badly run is that and

Donald Trump: that's not just a question of money

Donald Trump: it's a question of management it's a question of style our veterans are not

Donald Trump: being treated as well as a lot of people that come into our country illegally

Donald Trump: yeah

Donald Trump: large extent i mean we need certain regulations environmental we need and

Donald Trump: you know we need certain but we have it so excessive you can start businesses

Donald Trump: we're going to have the wall and Mexico's gonna pay for the wall right

Donald Trump: yeah

Donald Trump: yeah

Donald Trump: yeah

Donald Trump: yeah

Donald Trump: I have to say it's very interesting because a lot of the people the

Donald Trump: politicians that idea what they come to me and they say Donald you don't really

Donald Trump: mean bill to work you know they're not in the construction business like I am

Donald Trump: and like some of the people they really mean it too i mean they made it they

Donald Trump: wouldn't have any any chance of building because they wouldn't know where to

Donald Trump: begin but they come up and they say you don't really mean you're gonna build a

Donald Trump: wall do you you're kidding right you know you can I said not now it's easy

Donald Trump: precast blank being boom see the ceiling that stealing is a little low compared

Donald Trump: to this wall not a low ceiling too little out compared to our wall but

Donald Trump: think of it so they come up to me and they really made it they're good people

Donald Trump: they come up some are good people actually but they come see really build

Donald Trump: a convincing me really easy goes fast

Donald Trump: by the way over 12 version up but never see these highways where they put up the

Donald Trump: walls along the highways it always amazed me somebody buys a house along

Donald Trump: the highway so they know what they're buying right they do you know what I'm

Donald Trump: about to say the money that we waste so they buy a house and it's along a

Donald Trump: highway and highways a little noisy little everything but that's why they

Donald Trump: brought the acid wait for a low price because they don't want to be along a

Donald Trump: highway they don't want the the whatever it is that they don't want the noise so

Donald Trump: they buy this house and they happen and they're fine and then they get the

Donald Trump: government to build a wall and make the house more valuable in the government

Donald Trump: spends a fortune in the world but take those walls and they go up like magic

Donald Trump: now make it much much bigger

Donald Trump: okay i don't mean a little bit bigger I mean like if you get up there man you

Donald Trump: don't wanna you want to be very careful getting down and walls to work just ask

Donald Trump: Israel how to walzwerk Israel they work

Donald Trump: right right all you have to do is ask ask is real about what I ask is really

Donald Trump: about what

Donald Trump: so we're gonna build a wall and I also tell these folks when they come up and

Donald Trump: they talk about it's impossible to build a wall right you know and I really made

Donald Trump: it look at the highways they build these things all over the place I don't even

Donald Trump: know why I don't know what they built so many of them they're putting them all

Donald Trump: over the place I want somebody that's you know what's gonna help us

Donald Trump: ok it's going to help us but we're going to build a wall then they come up and

Donald Trump: they say you can't do it nicely away take a look at China they have a thing

Donald Trump: called the Great Wall of China I don't know if anybody's ever little wall that

Donald Trump: goes 13,000 miles right 13,000 miles the Great Wall of China 13,000 you know what

Donald Trump: 13,000 miles is i mean we're talking about a serious wall we're talking about

Donald Trump: a wall like there is no wall

Donald Trump: what's canada like five or six thousand right so we're talking about really much

Donald Trump: more than twice canada along canada so here we have a situation with

Donald Trump: politicians are telling me about the 1i refer them back 2,000 years

Donald Trump: this wall was built 2,000 years ago this by the way if anyone has ever seen the

Donald Trump: grip of China's a serious wall

Donald Trump: this is not a wall built with hydraulic equipment this was built with hydraulic

Donald Trump: muscles so it's 13,000 miles and was built 2,000 years ago so we have 2,000

Donald Trump: miles of which we really need only 1000 because we have a lot of natural borders

Donald Trump: right we have a lot of natural barriers and so we have thousands of US China had

Donald Trump: have Jacobson i have all but I bought millions and millions and millions of

Donald Trump: dollars of equipment millions of dollars worth of equipment and I try when i can

Donald Trump: divide made in the USA i try sometimes you can't because sometimes they devalue

Donald Trump: the dollar or the their currency so much they devalue like China is the Grand

Donald Trump: Master of devaluation and so now other countries I'm it doesn't take so much to

Donald Trump: figure it out what takes a lot is to get away with it because what they do is

Donald Trump: you want to try doing business in China it's almost impossible because they make

Donald Trump: it so difficult to get your product and i have friends and manufacturers they
