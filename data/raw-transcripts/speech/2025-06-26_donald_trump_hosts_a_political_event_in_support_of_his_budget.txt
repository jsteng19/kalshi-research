Donald Trump: Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. That's a good-looking group behind me. This group isn't too bad either. Very nice, nice to be with you. Beautiful, right, beautiful. Thank you very much and thank you all for being here to support one of the most important pieces of legislation in the history of our country.

Donald Trump: And that's everybody saying that, virtually everybody, the One Big, Beautiful Bill to secure our borders, turbocharge our economy and bring back the American dream. That's what's happening too. It's met with tremendous approval and reception. And when we were thinking about doing it, we were going to break it down into three, four, five, six or even seven bills.

Donald Trump: And I said, let's make it One Big, Beautiful Bill, Mike, right? They actually said it would be very much harder to get this way, but it would be better. And the truth is, I think it worked out well because there's something for everybody. And I think in many ways much better. We're delighted to be joined by secretaries Marco Rubio, Scott Bessent, Pete Hegseth, Doug Burgum, Doug Collins, Sean Duffy, Howard Lutnick, Linda McMahon, Brooke Rollins, Scott Turner, Chris Wright.

Donald Trump: Wow, that's a hell of a group. I think that's the biggest -- That's the biggest group of cabinet members, huh? That's the biggest group of cabinet -- and we're not finished yet because we have our great attorney general Pam Bondi here. US Trade Representative, and he's working around 24 hours. We have one after another, countries come, everybody wants to be with us because we have the hottest country in the world.

Donald Trump: A year ago, we had a disaster on our hand. We had the coldest country, I think by far and now we have the hottest. The king of Saudi Arabia, when I was there, we brought back $5.1 trillion between Qatar, Saudi Arabia and UAE. And all three said -- great leaders, they all said to me the same thing, you know, it's amazing in four months at that time.

Donald Trump: At that time, now it's getting to be close to six. But in four months they said you have the hottest country anywhere in the world, it's not even close. And they thought we were dead a year before that. They said I thought you were dead. The country was dead, and it was pretty close to it. But we have the hottest country in the world.

Donald Trump: So, it's great. And Trade Representative Jamieson Grier is very busy because -- where are you Jamieson? Everybody -- everybody wants to make a deal and have a part of it, right? I know you and Howard and Scott are working overtime making deals with other countries. Remember, a few months ago, the press was saying, do you really have anybody of any interest?

Donald Trump: Well, we just signed with China yesterday, right? Just signed with China. We have everybody -- we're not going to make deals with everybody. Some we're just going to send them a letter, say thank you very much. You're going to pay 25, 35, 45 percent. That's the easy way to do it and my people don't want to do it that way.

Donald Trump: They want to do some of it, but they want to make more deals than I would do. But we're having some great deals. We have one coming up maybe with India, a very big one where we're going to open up India. In the China deal we're starting to open up China, things that never really could have happened. And the relationship with every country has been very good.

Donald Trump: And we also have OMB director who's very busy also, Russ Vought. Thank you. Thank you, Russ. And also, I want to give a very special thank you. This is a hell of a group we have here. This is amazing, the quality of people. But actually, I like these people and most of those people much better than the people I just named, OK? But a very special thanks as well to Speaker Mike Johnson, whose a great, legendary guy.

Donald Trump: He's going to go down as a legend. A great friend of mine, a fantastic Senator, Roger Marshall, wherever you may be, Roger. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Bernie Moreno. Great win Bernie had in Ohio. Bernie, great win. That was a tough race. They said that was not winnable anyone by about 5 points.

Donald Trump: So, that was pretty good. So much for not winnable. Mike Lee is here, Mike. Hi, Mike. Thank you, Mike. Tim Sheehy, another tremendous win. Way to go Tim. Young, handsome. That was another race that wasn't supposed to be able to be won. They said we have a very young, handsome guy. I said does that matter.

Donald Trump: Looks don't matter, do they, Mike? looks? Anyway, great, great job. You can't help it. [Laughter] You can't help it. Great. That was a great race. Along with representatives Paul Gosar, Greg Murphy, Tom Kane, Jen Kiggans, Rob Bresnahan, who's a -- where is Rob? Stand up, Rob. Let me see you. Good, he's done a fantastic job.

Donald Trump: And Ryan Mackenzie thank you, Ryan. Thank you all. That's great. It's a big group of people. We're here this afternoon to share the stories of an incredible group of patriots from across the nation whose future we are defending with the One Big, Beautiful Bill. This is the ultimate codification of our agenda to very simply a phrase that's been used pretty well by me over the last 10 years, but maybe even before that -- Make America Great Again.

Donald Trump: Very simple, Make America Great Again. When Joe Biden used to get up and say we will stop this horrible MAGA. We're going to stop MAGA. We're going to fight it. We're going to -- I said, Joe, loosen up, it's called Make America Great Again. It's OK. [Laughter] Remember, he got up so angry. He was so angry.

Donald Trump: I said Make America Great Again. But we'll deliver a record tax cut, a record spending cut, a record investment in border security. We've done so well on the border. You know, last month we had zero people that crossed the border, zero. So, Kristi and Tom Homan and some of the people, what a job you've done, what a -- but you know, people forget about that, they don't care, the border has been fixed.

Donald Trump: I wanted to talk about the border two days ago. A big group, sir, they don't want to hear about the border. Why? It's fixed, you know. [Laughter] It's the second time it happened to me. In 2016, I won on the border. I fixed it in about three months. It was beautiful. And they wouldn't let me talk about the border.

Donald Trump: Sir, nobody wants to hear about the border. But we're going to talk about it anyway. Right, Tom Homan? We're talking about it anyway. So we have a big number of dollars that's coming here. Because we want to keep it that way and we want to keep it fixed and a record number of deportations. We're bringing criminals out by the thousands.

Donald Trump: Nobody can even imagine. They let people in that were murderers. 11,888 murderers, gang members, people from mental institutions and insane asylum. You know what that is, that insane asylum, that's a mental institution on steroids. And during the campaign I talked about the late great Hannibal Lecter. Do you know who that is Hannibal Lecter? [Laughter] Silence of the Lambs.

Donald Trump: I talked about it and the fake news would go crazy. Why does he keep mentioning? Well, because we won in a landslide, that's why. [Laughter] They don't want to have -- they don't want to have Hannibal in our midst. And the day I signed this bill into law, almost every major promise made in the 2024 campaign already will have become a promise kept.

Donald Trump: And that's very important. Promises made promises kept. And according to the Council of Economic Advisors, these reforms will protect or create more than 7 million jobs, add 3.1 percent to economic growth, reduce taxes for the typical American by nearly 15 percent and increase take home pay for the normal family of Four, by at least $13,000 And that takes place immediately.

Donald Trump: That's not bad, right? Look, I'm looking at that guy back there. Right? That's pretty good. And if we had a person over at the Fed that would lower interest rates a little bit, that would be helpful, too. [Laughter] It's hard to believe this is on top of, you know, we have to fight this guy. He's not doing the job.

Donald Trump: Each point that he keeps it up is the equivalent of $300 billion, $300 billion. So if he lowered it too, we would save $600 billion. We have to work hard with cuts on that, right? That's a lot of cutting. And this guy could do it so easily. We don't have inflation. Well, we might have inflation. Yeah. And if you do, you raise the rate a little bit.

Donald Trump: That's OK. But we're going out because Biden gave us a lot of short term debt. And in giving a short term debt, he did us no favor. So I think what we'll do is we'll probably just extend the short term debt and then go out. Because I don't want to tie it up for 10 or 15 years at a high rate. But every point is three -- it's really more is $300 billion.

Donald Trump: So if we got -- got it down to one percent, we're talking about almost $1 trillion in savings just with the stroke of a pen. No work. No missing anything. Just like an accounting situation. Oh, Doug Collins. I just see Doug. Did I mention you, Doug? I don't think so. I'm glad I saw you. I'm glad that somebody is going to be in big trouble with you.

Donald Trump: They didn't write your name down, Doug. [Laughter] Somebody's in big -- somebody's -- somebody's in -- I got you. [Laughter] So we -- think of that though. We -- we save. And all you have to do is so simple. I'm explaining to this guy. And Biden extended him. That wasn't good. I'm explaining to him. You can do so much for our country.

Donald Trump: You could save $1 trillion just with a stroke of a pen. Just a little -- the utterance of a sentence that we're going to be cutting. It's a shame. It's a shame. We're one of the highest. We should be the lowest. You know, we're the United States of America. We'd have money coming in like at levels that they have never seen.

Donald Trump: I got a call the other day from the people in Congress because we're doing our bill. I didn't even tell you this, Mike. And they called -- they said something -- there's something wrong with the numbers, sir. I said what's wrong? I don't know. They're not balancing out. There's something really wrong. I said is that a good thing or a bad thing?

Donald Trump: Well, we don't know. It's just -- I said what's the problem. We're taking in much more money than we have scheduled. I said, so far, that sounds good. [Laughter] They said how much is it? About $80 billion. I said, do me a favor, check the tariff line. They called me back an hour later. Sir, we've taken an $ 88 billion in tariffs.

Donald Trump: Isn't that a beautiful thing? $88 billion. I thought I'd tell these little stories. Go off script and tell these little stories, Scott, right? Because it does make it a little more interesting. Although, my speechwriters have just gotten every award in the book. [Laughter] Vince? Where are you Vince? Good?

Donald Trump: Where are we? Where's Ross? He's gotten all these awards and I'm going off the record all the time. Where is he? He didn't show up to the speech. [Laughter] He wrote the speech. He didn't show up. Well, that means he has confidence in me. [Laughter] According to the Council of Economic Advisers, these reforms will protect or create more than 7 million jobs, add 3.1 percent to economic growth, reduce taxes for the typical American by nearly 15 percent.

Donald Trump: And increase take home pay for a normal family four by an incredible $13,000. All of these things are happening. And by the way, there's no inflation. All of the numbers I gave you, all of the money that's coming in and maybe more importantly than the billions of dollars we're taking in with tariffs is the fact that we're -- we've got hundreds of plants going up all over the United States that never would have been here.

Donald Trump: I was with Howard and Scott and Texas Instruments. The other day and the head of Texas Instruments, they're going to spend $60 billion in the United States. And he said, sir, please don't do it to me. And I looked at him. I knew exactly what he meant. I said you mean tariffs, right? He said that's right.

Donald Trump: If you ever get rid of those tariffs, you've cost me a fortune. They're all coming in because they don't want to pay the tariffs. And they're coming in at levels. And it only works for the United States because people -- it doesn't work for other countries, but it works for us. We have a record investment.

Donald Trump: We have records and everything. And when these places open up, that's bigger than the $15 trillion that I'm talking about. You know, you don't see it right away. But bigger is the fact that they're all coming in. They're building their factories. The AI factories and the auto plants. We have auto plants.

Donald Trump: They're closing up in other countries. I don't want to specifically name the countries, but you know who they are. And they're coming into the US and they're opening up and building like no -- nobody's ever seen anything like it. I don't call it a miracle. I call it -- this should have been done 40 years ago.

Donald Trump: We would have never lost our auto. We lost 50 percent of our auto industry to China, Mexico, Canada and various other countries. It should have never happened if you had a president that said we're going to charge you tariffs. You're not going to build next to us, send it in and take away our jobs. If you would have said 25, 50 or 100 percent tariff, not one company would have left.

Donald Trump: But they weren't businesspeople. They were politicians, not very good ones and some good ones, but some really not good at anything to be honest with you. [Laughter] We're going to stop the largest tax hike, and we're going to do that, in history. This would be -- if the bill doesn't pass, there'll be a 68 percent tax increase.

Donald Trump: Think of that. 68 percent, which would be the largest in history by about 40 points. And we'll make the Trump tax cuts permanent, expand the Child Tax Credit. And we will deliver no tax on tips, no tax on overtime and no tax on Social Security for our great seniors. Among the countless citizens who will benefit from these tax cuts is Malachi Kraszewski, a devoted mom and DoorDash driver from Ripon, Wisconsin, who uses her tip income to support her son to -- think of that no tax on tips.

Donald Trump: And it was a very big problem. I was at a dinner in my beautiful building in Las Vegas, and unrelated to this. And I said what's going on -- I don't -- I will never say good looking waitress because looks don't matter anymore. You know, in our modern society. [Laughter] She happened to be beautiful, but I won't say that. [Laughter] I won't mention that, but nevertheless a waitress came over. [Laughter] And I said how are you doing?

Donald Trump: She said not good, sir. Why? The government is killing me on tips. And she looked at me. She said sir, there should be no tax on tips. I said, say it again. [Laughter] There should be no tax on tips. I said that's the coolest thing I've ever heard. I walked outside, the press was there, as always, waiting for something bad to happen.

Donald Trump: Hundreds of them. [Laughter] I said ladies and gentlemen, please announce tonight there will be no tax on tips. And a legend was made. We won Nevada by so much. [Laughter] Republicans don't win Nevada. We won Nevada. So I want to thank that young, beautiful waitress. Thank you very much. [Laughter] But with no tax on tips and other cuts, this bill will save Malachi thousands of dollars per year, enabling her to achieve her goal of visiting every US state with her son.

Donald Trump: She wants to visit every state by the time he's 18 years old. So Malachi, it sounds to me like you're off to a fantastic start. And where are you Malachi? Where are you?

Malachi Kraszewski: [Inaudible] Right here.

Donald Trump: Congratulations.

Malachi Kraszewski: [Inaudible] thank you.

Donald Trump: Great. That's great. Thank you. Also with us today is Luke Wilson, a 23 year old electoral lineman, he loves -- he loves the -- he loves being an electrician, but in this case, the lineman, and these are guys that take big risks and it's hard stuff. But if you know what you're doing, it's fine. He's from Harmony, Pennsylvania as well as De Silva, a truck driver from Springfield, Missouri, where, by the way, our beautiful planes landed, our B-2s, they landed after 36 hours of flying.

Donald Trump: Great going, Pete. And they hit the target -- and they hit the target, and the target has now been proven to be obliterated, just as we said. We had little fake news from CNN. Thank you very much, CNN, for that. With 3 million miles of driving under her belt, who mentors other women in her industry. And I just want to say Luke and De spend countless hours working overtime to help make this country run.

Donald Trump: And with this bill, the typical overtime worker like them will take home nearly $1,500 extra every single year. So, you're talking about at least $1,500 and there will be no harassment -- because you were being harassed by the Democrats. So, Luke and De, congratulations to you both. Thank you very much. Congratulations wherever you may be. Thank you.

Donald Trump: Thank you very much. Also with us is James Benson, a third-generation autoworker from Belleville, Michigan who has spent 26 years at Ford Motor Company, which is doing very well. They have a lot of plants in this country. If you have plants in this country, you're going to make a lot of money. And as a member of a tremendous group of people, autoworkers -- and I'll tell you, we love these people, auto workers for Trump.

Donald Trump: And I came through for them, but they were with me long before I really thought -- a lot of people said is he going to run again? Will he run? They've always been with me, the autoworkers. James was a lifelong Democrat until 2017 when he saw the benefits of our tax law and he also liked Trump. Now sometimes they can like the law, but if they don't like the candidate, it's not going to matter, right?

Donald Trump: Is that right, Marco? Marco knows because he has been one hell of a great Secretary of State, right? Stand up, Marco. Everybody respects Marco, right? True, everybody respects him. Now we're delivering an even bigger win for the auto workers by making interest on car payments fully tax deductible. You know, that's something only rich people seem to have gotten.

Donald Trump: I said, you know -- and that was my idea. It's pretty simple. But I said, you know the rich people, they're always looking for deductions, we want deductions. Linda, did I say -- will you please stand up? Linda McMahon. So great. How much is Harvard going to be charged? How much are you asking for Harvard?

Donald Trump: Because they really have violated a lot of different caveats, haven't they? A lot, like a lot? They've been given $5 billion over the years, can you imagine? And that's over a short number of years; that's just the beginning. They have $52 billion sitting in the bank and they haven't been nice to our country.

Donald Trump: So, I want to thank Linda McMahon, who's been really fantastic. But I said -- on interest, I said why couldn't we -- if a car is made in the United States only, because otherwise we don't care if it's made someplace else, give the people that buy the car a deduction on the interest that they're paying to buy the car.

Donald Trump: And people said what a great idea, it's so simple, it's like the paperclip. Somebody came up with the idea of a paperclip many years ago, 1817, and he became a very rich person. And everybody looked at it and said why the hell didn't I think of that? But it's like the paperclip but only if the car is made in America.

Donald Trump: Remember that. James, we're going to keep those Michigan auto factories roaring. And as you know, we won Michigan by a lot, Susie, right? We won Michigan by a big margin and something that typically is not easy. But I think we won it. I actually think we won it three times in a row. So, it's been a great state, but a big factor with the auto workers.

Donald Trump: They went with us very big, and I love them. The One Big, Beautiful Bill will also be an incredible victory for American farmers. Another group that we did great with, especially family farmers like James Cullipher of Virginia Beach, our bill will provide 100 percent expensing so they can buy a new farm, new farm equipment.

Donald Trump: And by the way, the expensing is good for everybody, not just farmers. And it will virtually eliminate the so-called estate tax or the death tax. So, you have a farm, you leave it to your children. If you like the children, you leave it. If you don't, don't worry about the details. [Laughter] No, some people don't want to leave them -- they don't like their kids, you know. [Laughter] Anybody in here not liking their children?

Donald Trump: Farmers? But if you like your kids, you want to leave it. And a lot of times what was happening before I got there, because I put this in the first tax bill, as you know. But people would die, they'd leave their farm, there was no cash, but there was value to the farm, sometimes good value. It's called real estate rich and cash poor.

Donald Trump: And the kids had no money and they'd be foreclosed out by a bank. They'd borrow money to pay the estate tax. You don't have to pay estate tax anymore. That's pretty big stuff. So, for the farmers, and for others in small business, it's great. But James's family has been working the land for generations. And with this bill, we will ensure that family farms like his can stay in the family for many generations to come.

Donald Trump: Where's James? James, where's James? Well, how are you? OK, that's great. And you know what, I mean, James, right? People pass away, they love their kids or whoever they're leaving, but they love their kids especially. And you won't have the family farm anymore for a long time because they were losing them to the banks and they were losing them at record numbers, not going to happen anymore.

Donald Trump: There's no tax. We're also going to empower American parents by expanding opportunity scholarships to provide school choice. School choice is a big deal. And we just got school working -- with the governor of Texas, as you know, Greg Abbott. We just had it passed in Texas. And I know about that, somebody said, yeah, that was a big deal.

Donald Trump: They've been trying to get it for nine years and they asked me if I'd call the legislature, Republicans in the legislature and I did. And I gave them a pep talk and everybody voted for it first time -- they were shocked. But they never asked me to Call them before, this was the first time and they got it passed, right, Susie?

Donald Trump: It was amazing, and it was something that Dan and Greg and everybody, they really wanted it. And Ted Cruz wanted it badly; they all wanted it. So, we got it in Texas. But you're going to have it, more and more people are talking about school choice, good thing. This will be the godsend for mothers like Angelina Banks from Philadelphia.

Donald Trump: Where's Angelina? Where's Angelina? Oh, oh, oh, oh, you are very pretty. [Laughter] She went out for a second and she's coming back. OK. Where's Ange? Come on over here, Angelina? Oh, That's terrible. Oh, wow! How are you? I won't ask you where you've been, OK? I promise. But it's great to have you. It's great to have.

Donald Trump: I mentioned your name. I said where's Angelina. They said she'll be right back, sir. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. And Aubrey and Ava Jane, Angelina says the tax relief for childcare and education are a foundation for stability and dignity -- I think those were your words, right, stability and dignity, good words -- for her family.

Donald Trump: And with the One Big, Beautiful Bill, we're delivering both empowering hundreds of thousands of families to choose the public-private charter religious school or the home school of their choice. And Angelina, thank you very much for being with us. Beautiful, beautiful. So, this bill will also be the single most important piece of border legislation ever to cross the floor of Congress.

Donald Trump: We will hire 3,000 new Border Patrol officers and 10,000 new ICE agents. And these people are great. I tell you what, I got to know a lot of them. And we have tremendous representation -- they've been for me from day one. In fact, I shouldn't say this, but they endorsed me when I first ran, almost at the beginning.

Donald Trump: And they weren't sure if they were allowed to endorse me. And they said we don't care, we're endorsing you. But they were great, and they've been my friends ever since. But think of that -- so we're going to hire 3,000 new Border patrol officers, 10,000 new ICE agents. And you know, these ICE guys, they go into war zones and they're tough and they love our country.

Donald Trump: And if you're not going to be tough, you're not going to do well. But they are tough, and they'll break into a pack. They go in a pack, some of these packs come out of the jails of Venezuela. They come from places that you don't want to know about. They're gang members that have been all sent in here through Biden's open door, stupid policy and the dumbest policy I think -- well, we have a lot of dumb policies, but the worst I think is open borders where anybody comes into our country totally unvetted, totally unchecked.

Donald Trump: And they're drug dealers and they're people that we don't want them. And they're murderers, you know, they're murderers. I told you over 11,000 murderers, they're in here. 50 percent of those, by the way, murdered more than one person and they came in no checking, no anything. It's so sad what that man has done to this country.

Donald Trump: We should never forget it, OK? We should never ever forget it with that whole group of people. I don't even think it was him. He didn't believe in open borders. He didn't believe in men playing in women's sports or transgender for everybody. But what that group of people has done to this country will never ever -- I hope -- I don't think we can ever allow history to forget it. What they've done to us is so sad.

Donald Trump: We're going to fully fund the final sections of border wall, impose a new remittance tax on money sent back to foreign countries and dramatically increase deportations to a bare minimum of one million illegal aliens per year. And what we're doing is we're really going after the criminal aliens of which we have plenty to work with.

Donald Trump: People say, well, that's a lot, isn't it? I'd say, well, remember these countries are very smart. They're headed up by people I know. In all -- almost all cases they're very smart, smart people and they have the people of great commonsense. They're not sending their good people out. They're sending their bad people out.

Donald Trump: And they put them into caravans. I think I came up with that name, but somebody did. It's a great name, a caravan. Thousands and sometimes as many as 30,000 people walking right into our country. Again, last month we had none. Think of that. It's almost people say it's almost impossible. But they come in. And at a minimum, they're not people that work very hard.

Donald Trump: They're people that are on welfare. They don't want them. They don't want them. They give them to us. It's uh, it's incredible what's happened and it's so sad to see. It's so sad. It could make you just sick to your stomach when you think about it. I was going to say it could make you cry, but I like to pretend I never cry. [Laughter] I don't want to be -- I don't want to be a crier.

Donald Trump: But it makes you sick to think of what they did. What they did to us is just sick. And guys, if we didn't have a Tom Homan and if we didn't have some of the guys that we have working so hard and dangerously, um, the country wouldn't stand a chance. But we're getting them out, not as fast as they came in because they came in, you'd see hundreds of thousands pour into our country in a day.

Donald Trump: But we're getting them out. And here today is Angel Dad, Joe Abraham. The Angel Moms and Angel Dad -- Dads. These are incredible people. They lost their precious 20 year old daughter, Katie, in a hit and run after she was struck by an illegal alien from Guatemala. Katie was stopped at a traffic light, rear ended full force going 60-70 miles an hour right into the back of her car while she stopped.

Donald Trump: And she died immediately. And her killer, I think you could really say the killer fled the scene. And Joe, we will end this invasion once and for all. And we're always going to remember the memory of Katie that beautiful, beautiful 20 year old daughter of yours. Where's Joe? Is he around here? Joe? Come here, Joe, come here.

Joe Abraham: [Inaudible]

Donald Trump: [Inaudible] Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy. Thank you very much. Also with us is Sarah Stewart from Kerrville, Texas who lost her brother to the fentanyl epidemic that has inundated her small town. Our bill provides billions and billions of dollars to stop fentanyl and other illicit narcotics. We're also charging other countries like Mexico, Canada and China, billions of dollars in taxes that we put on because they've allowed people that are selling fentanyl to go through their countries.

Donald Trump: Or in the case of China, they send it here. And paying a lot of money at least, but would rather stop it. I think we're doing a big job of that, but we'd rather stop it. And other illicit narcotics pouring across the border and stealing more American lives. And thank you. Sarah, we'll not rest until that fight is done.

Donald Trump: We're going to get that fight done. Sarah Stewart is where? Sarah? Hi, Sarah. Beautiful. Thank you. Good guy, huh. Yeah. I can see that. I also want to thank the president of the National Border Patrol. His name is Paul Perez. He's been with me from the beginning, and Brandon before him. These are great people.

Donald Trump: I've gotten very friendly with some of these people from Border Patrol and ICE because I really, I call them once every two or three days. How are we doing? How are we doing? How are we doing? If you remember, Kamala was the border czar. And in four years she never made one call to Paul or Brandon or anybody else.

Donald Trump: And I'd like to have Paul come up say a couple of words. If you're here, Paul. Where are you, Paul? Oh, there you are. Go ahead.

Paul Perez: President Trump made promises that he's kept. Now, it's time for Congress to back him up. We need to end the chaotic and recklessness that Biden allowed into this country. The millions of people that are out there, we're going to get with this Big, Beautiful Bill. We've got the funding. We've got the technology.

Paul Perez: We need everything in that bill to get it done so that no more families are victimized. And those that are victimized families, we can go get them out with ICE. Our officers and agents are not afraid. We're ready to take this fight to them. And we've been so because of President Trump's leadership. Thank you, sir.

Donald Trump: He's been a great friend of the country. He really has. And he's worked with Tom Homan and Kristi and all the people that worked so hard. They have been incredible. And you know, I wasn't going to do this, but I see Tom Homan is sitting there. And you know, I have to call him up. Look at that. I don't call up the speaker of the House.

Donald Trump: I don't call up Marco or Peter or any of them, but I want to call this guy because this guy is keeping us very, very safe. Come on up.

Tom Homan: Well, look, I think this issue of the Big, Beautiful Bill should be nonpartisan. I don't know how -- what the hell's the matter with everybody up in Congress? People are dying every day. ICE is arresting three times as many criminals as the Biden administration did. We're taking public safety threats and national security threats off the street every single day.

Tom Homan: We got over 600,000 illegal aliens with criminal histories walking the streets of this country. We got less than 5,000 deportation officers. This should be a no brainer. The more resources we get, if we get this bill passed, we got more agents on -- on -- on the road. We buy more beds. We get more transportation flights.

Tom Homan: More agents means more bad guys arrested taken off the streets of this country every single day. Every day we arrest a public safety threat or national security threat, just makes this country much safer. Who the hell would be against that? And I -- and I get irritated. I get pissed off because I'm sick of meeting Angel Moms and Dads.

Tom Homan: You want to talk about family separation. They buried their children. So this -- I've done this since 1984. I worked for six different presidents. No one has had the success of the Trump administration. We got the most secure border in the history of this nation today. But -- but we need more border wall.

Tom Homan: Border wall saves lives. Women and children can't get over that wall, which means they go to a place where there's not a wall. And what's waiting on them? The men and women of Border Patrol who take care of this humanitarian needs and save their lives. We already got fentanyl seizures down half. Fentanyl seizures should be 100 percent.

Tom Homan: We should have zero fentanyl coming to this country. We need money to help secure that border at a higher level. Stop the fentanyl from coming in, stop the -- stop the sex trafficking women and children. Stop the known and suspected terrorists coming across that border. Right now, I was looking at the stats today, ICE has arrested a record number of known suspected terrorists in this country along with the FBI.

Tom Homan: With more money, we can arrest more of these people make this country safer. It's a nonpartisan issue. Let's make this country safe again. So to the Democrats and the Republicans and the Independents, I don't care who you're from, pass the bill so we can make this country safe, so we can stop the violence against ICE officers.

Tom Homan: Let's make this country safe again. And without that bill, it's going to be a hard road. We got a lot of people to look for, a lot of people to arrest, a lot of national security threats we know are in this country. We need to find them. We need more money to do that. We know we need more agents to do that.

Tom Homan: For God's sake, let's pass this bill and get this done.

Donald Trump: He got so angry, he didn't even shake my hand or look at me just -- just -- just -- [Laughter] But he's right. He's right. And we have no money for the border. If we don't pass this bill, we have virtually nothing. And so we're going to get it done for you, Tom. And for all of the people that have worked with you.

Donald Trump: It's been amazing the job you've done. And just in finishing, look, this is the largest tax cut in the history of our country. They want to give you -- the Democrats want to give you the biggest tax increase in the history of our country. They have things whether it's border or economic development or no tax on tips and Social Security and no tax on overtime and all these different things.

Donald Trump: There are hundreds of things here. It's so good. And we're going to also cut costs. We're cutting $1.7 trillion in this bill. And you're not going to feel any of it, and your Medicaid is left alone; it's left the same. Your Medicare and your Social Security are strengthened. We're not cutting -- the Democrats are going to destroy all three of them because it's not sustainable.

Donald Trump: They'll end up cutting your Medicare and Medicaid in half. So, we're going to do a real job. It's so important. So, if you can call your Senators, call your congressmen, we have to get the vote. I want to thank you. You have been unbelievable, Mr. Speaker, you have worked around the clock for months for months.

Donald Trump: And you know, I shouldn't say this, but we don't want to have grandstanders where one or two people raise their vote, we vote no, and they do it to grandstand. That's all, not good people. They know who I'm talking about, I call them out. But we don't need grandstanders. We have to get our country back and bring it back strong.

Donald Trump: And our country is going to be stronger, bigger, better than ever before. We're going to make it better than ever before and that's despite the bad hand that we were dealt six months ago. We were dealt a really bad hand. We were dealt a sick hand. It's unbelievable. You know, when I came back yesterday, as you know, I made a big trip to a place where we had 28 countries represented and we did something that's never been done.

Donald Trump: They've raised the number of money -- the amount of money that they [Inaudible] to $1 trillion a year and that's for world safety. But they all asked me the same question. They said how could you have allowed this to happen to your country? I said I didn't do it, but they said how could you allow people to pour in? They don't understand it. They all have borders, they have fences, they have walls, or they have just strong people standing there.

Donald Trump: You can't do it. And they said to me it's amazing that they allowed these things to happen. And it's amazing too, I agree. You know, as a business guy, I always like to understand where the other side's coming from, what do they want, what do they get. And you know, you can make good deals based on understanding the other side.

Donald Trump: I never understood the other side in this case, why would they allow people to pour into our country unchecked? You know, I can see people wanting people to come in and you let them come in. You have a vetting process; you let good people -- we're letting a lot of good people in, but they're coming in legally.

Donald Trump: But why would you allow people to come in that you can look at them and say big trouble, big trouble. Why would you do it? Nobody understands. And a lot of people say voting. But you know, we've got to strengthen up our elections because the voting is crooked as hell, got to strengthen it up. But it's not that.

Donald Trump: It's either they're stupid -- and they're not stupid -- or they hate our country. But we love our country and we're going to stop this madness and we're going to get this bill approved. And all of the things that I've been talking about now for two years on the campaign trail -- and we won. Remember, we won every single swing state.

Donald Trump: We won by millions of votes. We won everything. We won every -- it was a landslide. We won something that nobody talks about, districts, you have thousands of districts. We won 2,750 to 505. Think of that, that's why when you see a map, the whole map is red, that stands for Republican by the way, because it stands for a lot of other things too.

Donald Trump: But it stands for Republican, with a little piece of blue on each side. But that's why think of that, 2,750 districts to 505 districts, that's why this was a slaughter. But it gave us a mandate to do some great things. And I want to thank John Thune, and I want to thank the speaker, and I want to thank Marco and everybody here, everybody here.

Donald Trump: They have been so incredible. Pam, you've been unbelievable as the attorney general. We appreciate it. Not easy, not easy. And we're coming back faster than anybody ever thought possible. I told you what they said to me on just trips by very smart people, but we're going to make this -- we're going to do this very quickly.

Donald Trump: It's happening a lot faster than even I thought possible. And we're going to be celebrating very quickly and we're going to be celebrating for a long time because we're turning our country around. We're getting our country back and we're ruling with common sense, you know. Whether you're conservative or liberal or, as they like to say, progressive.

Donald Trump: They don't like the word liberal anymore. Progressive, I think it's a beautiful word too, that's why I call them liberal. It's too nice a word. [Laughter] I don't know how you can be progressive when you're turning the country backwards. But no matter what you are, it's all about common sense. And I think that's the way I've ruled.

Donald Trump: I do what's right, I want to have borders. I don't want to have transgender for anybody that happens to leave the house at a young age, the things they do. I don't want to have men playing in women's sports. That's got to be -- you know, they say it's an 80-20. I think it's a 97-3 issue, it's so ridiculous, it's so ridiculous.

Donald Trump: There was a long distance race the other day, or at least reasonably recently, and they had a top man and they had a top woman, but it was a woman's race. And the man entered, he happened to be transitioned, isn't that lovely? And he entered the race, and he beat the champion woman by five hours and 14 seconds, five hours.

Donald Trump: That's a lot. Think of it. You're waiting five hours for your beautiful daughter to come in, come on, baby, let's go, you can do it. He won by five hours and 14 seconds. It is crazy and it's so demeaning and they don't want to change. I see it the other day, guys like Schumer, our great Palestinian Senator. [Laughter] This guy, no, he's changed.

Donald Trump: He used to like Jewish people. Now, he's totally against Jewish people. It's the most incredible transformation I think I've ever seen. But who would allow this to happen? And other sports the same thing. Try the weightlifting numbers someday, you want to see some big differences. In a million years the women will never catch these numbers, it's not going to happen.

Donald Trump: And it's very demeaning to women, and I don't like it when it's demeaning to women. So, we're turning the country around fast. We love you all. Thank you very much and good luck. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
