Court Clerk: Calling People of the State of New York versus Donald J. Trump. Indictment 71543/23. Appearances, starting with the People.

Joshua Steinglass: For the People, ADAs Joshua Steinglass, Susan Hoffinger, Matthew Colangelo, Becky Mangold, Christopher Conroy and Katherine Ellis. Good morning.

Todd Blanche: Good morning. Todd Blanche. I'm joined by Emil Bove, Susan Necheles, Kendra Wharton, and President Donald Trump sitting to my right.

Juan Merchan: Good morning, everyone. Good morning, Mr. Trump. Before we get started with the first witness, is there anything you would like to bring to my attention?

Susan Hoffinger: No, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: I did receive the People's list of proposed jury charges. I glanced at them. I didn't have an opportunity to really digest them. I did want to address the Separation Agreement in general, the Release issue that came up late on Friday. I had the opportunity to review it. It would come in as a business record, but I'm not going to allow it in. It seems to me that this would be used to justify an explanation for why somebody is not here.

Juan Merchan: It doesn't prove any element of the offense. It doesn't move the ball in any way in satisfying your burden of proof. So, I'm going to deny your application. Can I hold onto this one?

Juan Merchan: If there's nothing else? Let's get the jury, please.

Court Officer: All rise. Jury entering.

Note: [Whereupon, the jurors and the alternate jurors are present and properly seated.]

Court Clerk: Do both parties stipulate that all jurors are present and properly seated?

Joshua Steinglass: Yes.

Todd Blanche: Yes.

Juan Merchan: Good morning, jurors. Welcome back. People, your next witness, please.

Susan Hoffinger: Thank you, your Honor. The People call Michael Cohen.

Court Officer: Witness entering.

Note: [M-I-C-H-A-E-L D-E-A-N C-O-H-E-N, having first been duly sworn and/or affirmed by the court clerk, was examined and testified as follows.]

Court Officer: State your full name, spelling your last name.

Michael Cohen: Michael Dean Cohen. C-O-H-E-N.

Court Officer: Your county of residence.

Michael Cohen: New York, New York.

Juan Merchan: Good morning, Mr. Cohen.

Michael Cohen: Good morning.

Juan Merchan: You may inquire.

Susan Hoffinger: Thank you, Judge.

Susan Hoffinger: Good morning.

Michael Cohen: Good morning.

Susan Hoffinger: If I might ask, how old are you, Mr. Cohen?

Michael Cohen: Fifty-seven.

Susan Hoffinger: Are you married?

Michael Cohen: I am.

Susan Hoffinger: How long have you been married?

Michael Cohen: Going on 30 years.

Susan Hoffinger: Do you have any children?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Susan Hoffinger: How old are your children?

Michael Cohen: My daughter is 28. My son is 25. Well, 24. He'll be 25.

Susan Hoffinger: Are you testifying here today pursuant to a subpoena?

Michael Cohen: I am.

Susan Hoffinger: Do you have an attorney here in court with you today?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Susan Hoffinger: Mr. Cohen, if you could tell the jury a little about where you grew up and your childhood education.

Michael Cohen: I grew up in Lawrence, Long Island. It's part of the Five Towns in Nassau County. My father is a Holocaust survivor, who ended up emigrating to Toronto, Canada, where he went to medical school, came to the United States in the mid-Sixties to teach head and neck reconstructive surgery, met my mom, who is a surgical nurse.

Michael Cohen: Four children later, here I am.

Susan Hoffinger: Where did you go to college?

Michael Cohen: I went to the American University in Washington, D.C.

Susan Hoffinger: What did you study in college?

Michael Cohen: Law and Government.

Susan Hoffinger: After college, what did you do?

Michael Cohen: I went straight to law school.

Susan Hoffinger: Tell the jury a little bit about why you wanted to be a lawyer.

Michael Cohen: Actually, I didn't want to be a lawyer. My grandmother wanted me to be a lawyer. My family is comprised of doctors and lawyers. My three siblings are lawyers. My -- obviously, my father, my uncles are either doctors or lawyers. The lawyers are married to doctors. I wanted to go to Wall Street. My grandmother was like, "That's not going to happen."

Susan Hoffinger: So, you went to law school?

Michael Cohen: [Nods yes.]

Susan Hoffinger: Did you graduate from law school?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: What year?

Michael Cohen: 1991

Susan Hoffinger: Were you admitted to practice law?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Do you remember what year that was?

Michael Cohen: 1992

Susan Hoffinger: After law school, where did you move?

Michael Cohen: I was living at my parents' home and, ultimately, moved to Manhattan.

Susan Hoffinger: Has New York City been your home since that time?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Where did you start your legal career?

Michael Cohen: I started over at 225 Broadway with a firm called Estrin and Associates. It was a personal injury, medical malpractice, tort litigation firm.

Susan Hoffinger: In addition to practicing law, at some point in the 1990s, did you also buy part of a business in taxi medallions?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: Explain why you did that.

Michael Cohen: So, one of my clients was leaving the country to move to Israel, and it gave me the opportunity to buy 50 percent interest in a company called Manhattan Maintenance. That was 1995. And so I did. I thought it was, and it turned out to be at that time, a very good investment.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you also invest in some real estate along the years?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: Tell us a little bit about that.

Michael Cohen: I started purchasing new developments, specifically in Trump properties. My very first one, in the year 2000, was at Trump World Tower. I also bought on 60th Street, 431 -- I'm sorry. It was called Bridge Tower on 60th Street. Ultimately, down the road, I ended up going into business with a friend of mine who had grown up with me, and we started purchasing buildings.

Susan Hoffinger: Did there come a time when you became a partner in a law firm called Phillips, Nizer?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: What kind of work did you do there?

Michael Cohen: I was, basically, doing business and corporate law.

Susan Hoffinger: Did there come a time when you left Phillips, Nizer?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Approximately, what year was that?

Michael Cohen: 2007

Susan Hoffinger: Why did you leave Phillips, Nizer?

Michael Cohen: I left because I was offered an opportunity by Mr. Trump to come work at The Trump Organization as his Special Counsel.

Susan Hoffinger: Do you see Mr. Trump in court today?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Susan Hoffinger: Could you just indicate an article of clothing that he's wearing, please?

Michael Cohen: [Lifts up from his seat.] He's wearing a blue and white tie. [Takes his seat.]

Juan Merchan: Indicating Mr. Trump.

Susan Hoffinger: Thank you.

Susan Hoffinger: Tell us how you came to work for Mr. Trump at The Trump Organization.

Michael Cohen: Initially, I was introduced to Mr. Trump by Don, Junior, as I was moving into one of his properties. I had purchased several units, and Don, Junior and The Trump Organization was doing the construction to put the units together. There was an issue over at Trump World Tower that Mr. Trump had asked me -- because not only did I own an apartment there, but my parents did, my in-laws, my friends.

Michael Cohen: We all bought as a block, going back, again, to the year 2000. And, there was an issue with the Board. What we did is we ended up overtaking the Board and resolving the issue, which was to Mr. Trump's satisfaction. He liked the way that that occurred, and then continued to ask me if I would assist in other issues, legal issues or other matters that he had.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you perform some additional legal work for him at that time?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: What --

Michael Cohen: Some legal. Some non-legal matters.

Susan Hoffinger: Did he pay you for that work?

Michael Cohen: No, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Did there come a time where you -- this was when you were still at Phillips, Nizer?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Did there come a time when you presented him with a bill in connection with some work you had done in connection with one of his properties?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Tell us a little bit about that.

Michael Cohen: I was asked to review a series of documents that dealt with Trump Entertainment Resorts. There was an issue --

Susan Hoffinger: Who was it who asked you to do that, first?

Michael Cohen: Mr. Trump had asked me.

Susan Hoffinger: Thank you.

Michael Cohen: Again, with Trump Entertainment Resorts. I reviewed it. It was quite lengthy. There was some issues going on there in regard to a Chapter 11 reorganization plan. We, ultimately, ended up resolving it. And the bill was, approximately, about -- approximately, about a hundred thousand dollars. I was then asked to meet Mr. Trump at the office, which I did.

Michael Cohen: And I asked about the bill. He asked me whether or not I was happy at my "sleepy old firm". I stated I was. Um, he said, Would you -- "Do you want to come work for me?" And I was honored. I was taken by surprise. And I agreed.

Susan Hoffinger: What happened -- to go back for a moment to the bill for a hundred thousand dollars that you presented from Phillip Nizer, your firm --

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Susan Hoffinger: -- what happened with that bill?

Michael Cohen: He asked me if I wanted to get fired on the first day. If I asked about the bill.

Susan Hoffinger: So, did the bill get paid?

Michael Cohen: No.

Susan Hoffinger: And, you say he offered you a position at that point?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Tell us a little bit about your discussion about the position that he was offering and the details of it.

Michael Cohen: So, he offered me the position of Executive Vice President at The Trump Organization and Special Counsel to Donald J. Trump, whereby I would only answer to him, and I would work on issues that were of concern to him.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you discuss at that point what your salary would be?

Michael Cohen: We did.

Susan Hoffinger: Tell us a little bit about that.

Michael Cohen: It was a little bit of a back and forth negotiation. He offered me an amount. I said, "It's probably not gonna work." I gave him a counter. And we ended up resolving on somewhere in the middle number.

Susan Hoffinger: Where did you end up -- what's the number that you sort of ended up at?

Michael Cohen: 375

Susan Hoffinger: Was that your base salary, bonuses?

Michael Cohen: That's base salary. Bonus, of course, was to be discussed.

Susan Hoffinger: So, did you decide at that point to leave your law firm, Phillip, Nizer, and to work for Donald Trump at The Trump Organization?

Michael Cohen: I never went back, not even that day. He sent over some employees to my office to pack up my office and gave me Ivanka Trump's old office on 26, the 26th floor.

Susan Hoffinger: Is that near his office on the 26th floor?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Are we talking about Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Where The Trump Organization offices were?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Approximately, how many years did you end up working at The Trump Organization as Mr. Trump's Special Counsel -- is that what you said?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: How long?

Michael Cohen: Ten years.

Susan Hoffinger: 2007 to approximately when?

Michael Cohen: January of 2017.

Susan Hoffinger: How old were you when you first started working at The Trump Organization for Mr. Trump?

Michael Cohen: Huh. Huh.

Susan Hoffinger: If you recall.

Michael Cohen: I don't.

Susan Hoffinger: Were you still in your thirties?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And was -- I think you mentioned before, but, when you started, what was your title?

Michael Cohen: Executive Vice President and Special Counsel to Donald J. Trump.

Susan Hoffinger: And just in terms of your salary and your bonus, approximately all in, how much were you making at The Trump Organization?

Michael Cohen: 525,000.

Susan Hoffinger: And did that change over the years or did it, largely, stay the same?

Michael Cohen: Well, it changed. Initially, after the second year, he cut my salary. Ultimately gave it back, two years after that. But it stayed the same.

Susan Hoffinger: Tell the jury a little bit about what kind of matters you handled for Donald Trump at The Trump Organization during that ten years.

Michael Cohen: It was whatever concerned him, whatever he wanted. Um, initially, when I first started working at The Trump Organization, I was presented with an opportunity, and I brought it to Mr. Trump immediately. We liked it. It was in New Jersey. It was called the EnCap Golf Redevelopment Project. It was a 1,000-acre landfill remediation project.

Michael Cohen: And this was all very exciting to me because it was all new, and I enjoyed the challenge. And, along with two other colleagues, we started to get this project up and running. It, ultimately, didn't come to fruition because the funding got pulled by Governor Corzine in New Jersey at the time. But, it was an exciting project.

Susan Hoffinger: So, this is one of the projects that you handled for him?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Who did you report to at The Trump Organization?

Michael Cohen: Mr. Trump.

Susan Hoffinger: Were you at any time part of the General Counsel's Office at The Trump Organization?

Michael Cohen: No, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: And why not?

Michael Cohen: That's not the discussion in terms of when I elected to take the position.

Susan Hoffinger: It was always reporting directly to Mr. Trump?

Michael Cohen: Just to Mr. Trump.

Susan Hoffinger: So, in the course of your work for Mr. Trump at The Trump Organization, did he ever ask you to renegotiate bills for him?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Tell the jury, give us some examples of your renegotiating bills and what you did.

Michael Cohen: Well, for example, a law firm would send an invoice. He didn't believe that the invoice was fair, reasonable, justified. And so, he would give me the task of renegotiating a specific bill.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you ever renegotiate bills from other types of vendors? For example, regarding Trump University?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Tell us a little bit about that.

Michael Cohen: So, Trump University fell into trouble, and there were approximately 50 vendors that had not been paid. There was a sum certain that was in the bank at the time. Approximately $2 million. Unfortunately, the bills far exceeded that $2 million. But, Trump was not going to fund the balance. And so, what I did is I put them onto a spreadsheet, a handwritten spreadsheet, divided it by the $2 million, and came up with basically 20 percent of everyone's invoice.

Michael Cohen: I contacted each and every one of the vendors, and all but two accepted, ultimately, the 20 percent. We had Releases drafted. And upon the receipt of the Release, within 48 hours, we had checks sent to them by FedEx.

Susan Hoffinger: So, did Mr. Trump ask you to renegotiate all those bills regarding Trump University?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And you said "all but two". What happened with the other two vendors?

Michael Cohen: They just went away.

Susan Hoffinger: You mean -- did you pay them?

Michael Cohen: No, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, once you accomplished that task for Mr. Trump of renegotiating all those bills with the Trump University, did you report back to him?

Michael Cohen: Yes. But not in its totality. Each and every Release was separate. I would go straight into Mr. Trump's office, and I would advise him of the task being accomplished.

Susan Hoffinger: Why did you do that?

Michael Cohen: For two reasons. The first was so that he knew I was on it and I was doing what he had asked. And the second was, really, to obtain credit so that he understood that, again, I was accomplishing what he wanted.

Susan Hoffinger: Do you have a memory of advising him about accomplishing that task of reducing the payments to vendors and his reaction? Do you have a memory of that?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: What do you remember him saying when you told him you accomplished that task?

Michael Cohen: "It's fantastic. It's great."

Susan Hoffinger: How did that make you feel?

Michael Cohen: Like I was on top of the world.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you renegotiate other bills for Mr. Trump at The Trump Organization, besides the ones that you just mentioned?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: From your experience over the ten years working at The Trump Organization, are you aware whether Mr. Trump directed other employees or executives to negotiate bills, not to take the first bill, but to negotiate them down?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Let me ask you a question, Mr. Cohen. During the years that you worked for Mr. Trump at The Trump Organization, did you threaten, at times, to sue people or companies during those years?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And explain why you did that.

Michael Cohen: Well, it would depend on what the issue was. We had an issue, for example, with a Miss USA Pageant contestant, who -- Mr. Trump was being defamed, the Miss Universe Organization, so he brought an arbitration against her. That matter, ultimately, got resolved. If -- with the press, as an example, that if they said something that angered him, I would reach out to the press, and I would express to them their need to either redact or take the article down or we would file an action against them.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you do that in a strong and threatening manner at times?

Michael Cohen: I would say so. Not all the time. But, often.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, you mentioned a bit about this. During your time working for Mr. Trump at The Trump Organization, did you also work on some personal matters for him?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Can you just give us a brief example of some of that?

Michael Cohen: So, one instance, his limousine was hit by a yellow cab. And, knowing that I had deep roots into the yellow cab industry, he asked me to meet with the driver, who provided me with the Police Report, and to have them pay for the repair on the vehicle.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you ever do some personal work for -- regarding his residence or his family, for example?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Tell us a little bit about that.

Michael Cohen: In his apartment, they had a flood that ended up causing damage into the main-floor bathroom. They had al fresco on top. And I handled the adjustment with the insurance company.

Susan Hoffinger: And these are all matters that Mr. Trump asked you to handle for him?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you also, as part of your work -- and I think you mentioned this -- interact frequently with the press for him?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Tell us a little bit about that.

Michael Cohen: Again, if it was in order to place a story that would be advantageous in some way, shape or form, I would speak with them. If there was an article that caused him displeasure, I would speak with them about that, as well.

Susan Hoffinger: So, did you work with the press to try to minimize negative stories and sort of enhance positive stories about Mr. Trump and his business?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Was that a good part of your work for him, interacting with the press for him?

Michael Cohen: It was a portion of it, yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, you mentioned that you worked at Trump Tower at the Offices of The Trump Organization, is that right?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Susan Hoffinger: During the time that you worked there, where, approximately, was your office in relation to Mr. Trump's office?

Michael Cohen: Well, initially, when I started, it was towards the back of the office that was Ivanka's old office, until, ultimately, I moved to a different office that was maybe 50 feet, 60 feet from his office.

Susan Hoffinger: During the time you worked there for Mr. Trump, approximately how often would you say you met with him or spoke with him?

Michael Cohen: Every single day and multiple times per day.

Susan Hoffinger: And now we're talking about in the period before he ran for President in 2016, is that right?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, at the time -- again, we're talking about pre-2016. But, in general, explain how you communicated with him.

Michael Cohen: Generally, it was either in person, on the cell phone, or on the cell phone. Those are really -- those are the two ways.

Susan Hoffinger: Understood. Did you have all of his cell phone and other telephone numbers in your contacts in your phone at the time?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: And you used all those variety of numbers as a way to contact him?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: When he called you, did he, generally, call you on your cell phone or your work phone at The Trump Organization?

Michael Cohen: Well, it was a combination of both. Most of the time, it would be on my cell phone. Unless it was in the office, he would have one of his assistants ring me and ask me just to come to Mr. Trump's office.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you ever contact Mr. Trump by contacting somebody else in order to get in contact with him?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Who did you contact at various times to reach him?

Michael Cohen: Many people. It depends, also, who he was with at the time. It could be Rhona, his Executive Assistant. Ultimately, Keith Schiller, who was his personal attach. It could be one of the Trump children. It could be Hope Hicks. It was any number of people.

Susan Hoffinger: And you had, for example, Keith Schiller's number in your contacts, as well, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And Hope Hicks' number in your contacts, as well, and you used those numbers in your contacts to make those calls, is that right?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: As far as you know, did Mr. Trump use email to do his work?

Michael Cohen: No. Mr. Trump never had an email address.

Susan Hoffinger: Did he ever comment to you about folks who time-to-time get into trouble using email?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Can you tell us about that?

Michael Cohen: Yes. During certain conversations, he would comment that emails are like written papers, it's -- he knows too many people who have gone down as a direct result of having emails that prosecutors can use in a -- in a case.

Susan Hoffinger: When you say "going down", do you mean getting in some sort of trouble?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: When you met him in person, you said -- where did you, generally, meet him?

Michael Cohen: In his office.

Susan Hoffinger: What times of day, generally, in his office?

Michael Cohen: All throughout the day.

Susan Hoffinger: Were they sometimes early in the morning?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Sometimes later, towards the end of the day or even early evening?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: When you met him at the office, did you, generally, meet in his office?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you need to make an appointment to go see him in his office?

Michael Cohen: No, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Can you explain, was there -- what kind of a policy was there at The Trump Organization about executives coming in to meet with Mr. Trump?

Michael Cohen: Mr. Trump had an open-door policy, which, if there was somebody in there, you waited, and if not, you knocked on the door, and I would say, "Boss, do you have a second?", and I would walk right in.

Susan Hoffinger: And others did the same, to your knowledge?

Michael Cohen: To my knowledge, yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, when you met with Mr. Trump at The Trump Organization, in his office, did you, generally, need -- I'm sorry. Did you, generally, record those meetings in your calendar?

Michael Cohen: No, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: As part of your work at The Trump Organization, did you feel that it was part of your job to keep him updated on matters that you were handling for him?

Michael Cohen: Yes. It was actually required.

Susan Hoffinger: Tell us what you mean by that.

Michael Cohen: When he would task you with something, he would then say, "Keep me informed. Let me know what's going on." And what he was saying, what everybody did is, as soon as you had a result, an answer, you would go straight back and tell him. Especially if it was a matter that was troubling to him.

Susan Hoffinger: So, two things, just to break that down. You said "everybody". Do you mean you're aware of other executives who --

Michael Cohen: I apologize. Yes. Other executives.

Susan Hoffinger: So, they would report back to him, as well?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: But, you felt it was part of your job, and what he wanted from you, to promptly report to him when you were handling a matter for him about the progress and whether it was resolved?

Michael Cohen: Yes.And that's what I did.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you have a sense or did you learn from your experiences with him that if you didn't keep him updated or things didn't go well that you were working on, that that would create an issue for Mr. Trump?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Can you explain that just a little bit?

Michael Cohen: If you didn't immediately provide him with the information and he learned of it in another manner, that wouldn't go over well for you.

Susan Hoffinger: To the extent that you discussed the requirement to report frequently to Mr. Trump, was it your sense, based on working with him, that he was a micromanager about the work of his organization and of which he was concerned?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you have a way of referring to Mr. Trump when you worked for him?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: What was that?

Michael Cohen: I would call him "Boss", "Mr. Trump".

Susan Hoffinger: And in working for him for ten years, all the variety of the types of work that you did for him, what was it like for you? How did you feel about working at The Trump Organization during those years?

Michael Cohen: It was fantastic. It was -- working for him, especially, during those ten years was -- [Pause] -- an amazing experience in many, many ways. There were great times. There were several less than great times. But, for the most part, I enjoyed the responsibilities that were given to me. I enjoyed working with my colleagues at The Trump Organization, the Trump children.

Michael Cohen: It was a big family.

Susan Hoffinger: During the years that you worked for him at The Trump Organization, did you at times lie for him?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: Why did you do that?

Michael Cohen: Because it's what was needed in order to accomplish a task.

Susan Hoffinger: Was there also a sense -- did you feel a sense of obligation towards him, as well?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you at times during your work for The Trump Organization -- at The Trump Organization, for Mr. Trump, bully people for him?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Why did you do that?

Michael Cohen: Again, in order to accomplish the task. The only thing that was on my mind was to accomplish the task to make him happy.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, over the years that you worked for him, did he reward you with some additional titles?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: What -- tell us just a little bit about that.

Michael Cohen: Well, he placed me on the Board of the Miss Universe Organization. There were three members: Mr. Trump, Allen Weisselberg and myself. Years later, myself and another colleague were made Co-Presidents of Trump Productions. I sat on the Board of four, five different Trump properties as Treasurer.

Susan Hoffinger: Those were some of the additional titles that he rewarded you with?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Are you aware that in connection with your work for him, some people described you as his "fixer"?

Michael Cohen: Yes. Some have described me as that.

Susan Hoffinger: From your perspective, is that in some ways an accurate title, an accurate moniker?

Michael Cohen: It's fair.

Susan Hoffinger: I just want to ask you some questions about your telephone numbers, and I'm going to ask you only about the last four digits of some of those numbers. During the period of 2015 to 2017, when you were working at The Trump Organization, did you use a cell phone number ending in 6866?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you also use a cell phone number ending in 0114?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you continue to use those two numbers for a period of time after you left The Trump Organization?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Do you still continue to this day to use the cell phone number ending 0114?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, during the time that you worked at The Trump Organization for Mr. Trump, you also had a landline work number, is that right?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Susan Hoffinger: Was that 212-836-3212?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Obviously, you no longer use that number?

Michael Cohen: No, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: After you left The Trump Organization, did you also have a number associated with a law firm in New York?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Was that 212-872-9849?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Obviously, you don't still use that number?

Michael Cohen: No, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: In connection with the investigation of this case, did our Office ask you to provide two cell phones that you had used for a period of time up until April of 2018?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you agree to provide those two cell phones to us that you had previously used with the two numbers -- cell phone numbers that I just mentioned, ending in 0114 and 6866?

Michael Cohen: Yes, I did.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you provide those phones to us in January of 2023?

Michael Cohen: Sounds correct. Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And was that pursuant to our request that you turned those over to us?

Michael Cohen: Yes. Merely the request.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you consent to do that voluntarily?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, you keep contacts on your phones, there were contacts that were kept on those phones, is that right?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Susan Hoffinger: What kind of information, just generally, was in your contacts on those phones?

Michael Cohen: Names, email addresses, potential addresses, cell phone numbers, home numbers, fax numbers.

Susan Hoffinger: Were there also, sometimes, other information associated with folks whose contacts you had in there?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you keep anybody else's contacts in your phone, as well?

Michael Cohen: Personal ones, yes.

Susan Hoffinger: In other words, however -- what I'm asking about is not just your contacts, of your contacts and the folks that you know, but, did you also, at some point, include or sync with your contacts somebody else's contacts?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: Tell the jury about that.

Michael Cohen: Actually, I didn't do it. It was done by the IT people. I was spending a significant amount of time with Mr. Trump, and we ultimately decided -- he agreed -- to have his contact numbers synced to my cell number, to my account as well. That way, if we needed to travel, if he needed to get somebody on the phone, he would just say, "Michael, get me" so and so "on the line," and I would have them in my cell phone.

Susan Hoffinger: As a result of this syncing process, did your personal contacts also end up in his phone?

Michael Cohen: I'm not certain about that.

Susan Hoffinger: You're not certain. Just his contacts in your phone?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Do you remember, approximately, when you synced or someone else synced his contacts into your phone, if you know?

Michael Cohen: I don't. I don't.

Susan Hoffinger: As a result of having both your contacts and Mr. Trump's contacts in your phone, did you have over 30,000 contacts in your phone?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: During the time you worked at The Trump Organization for Mr. Trump, was your email address mcohen@trumporg.com?

Michael Cohen: Yes, it was.

Susan Hoffinger: After you left The Trump Organization, during the years of 2017 and 2018, did you also use another email address, mcohen@mdpc.com?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: You no longer have that email address, is that right?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you also use a personal Gmail address that you still currently use?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Mr. Cohen, do you know someone named David Pecker?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Susan Hoffinger: Who is he, and how do you know him?

Michael Cohen: I knew David Pecker before I even knew Mr. Trump. We had mutual friends, and we had met at a function at -- out in Long Island. Many, many years ago. I then was re-acquainted with David Pecker, who is the President, CEO of AMI. Most people know him more from his magazines and his newspapers: National Enquirer, Star, Okay! and Men's Health, et cetera.

Susan Hoffinger: When you -- did you, from time to time, speak to Mr. Pecker even before he came -- before you started at The Trump Organization?

Michael Cohen: Not regularly, no.

Susan Hoffinger: Once you were at The Trump Organization and introduced to him again by Mr. Trump, did you speak to him from time to time?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: When you spoke to him, did you speak to him by phone?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you have his cell phone and work numbers in your phone contacts?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you use those contacts to speak with him?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: At times, did you also speak with Mr. Pecker using an encrypted application called Signal?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Why did you do that?

Michael Cohen: Well, depending upon the matter, sometimes we thought that encryption, not having the event traceable would be beneficial.

Susan Hoffinger: Was it because it was something you wanted to keep confidential and didn't want anybody to be able to trace it or look into those communications?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you also, at times, communicate with Mr. Pecker by email?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And you had his email address, as well, in your contacts, is that right?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, did you speak with Mr. Pecker at The Trump Organization about matters having to do with Mr. Trump prior to June of 2015?

Michael Cohen: Yes, but rarely.

Susan Hoffinger: And was it -- what sort of matters were the few matters that you spoke to him about, if you can remember, prior to 2015?

Michael Cohen: There was some things that had come up. For example, Mr. Trump had donated money to a charity. It was Harlem for Hoops. We had come into information that they had no funding, and I brought it to Mr. Trump's attention. He said, "Yes," we wanted to get the story out. So, it would be things like that. And --

Susan Hoffinger: To try to get a nice -- a good story out about him?

Michael Cohen: A good story, yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And -- to your knowledge, prior to 2015, when Mr. Trump announced that he was running for the Presidency, did you know whether Mr. Pecker or AMI ever paid for public stories to prevent them from becoming public?

Michael Cohen: There were stories.

Susan Hoffinger: I apologize. My question is quite wrong. Prior to Mr. Trump announcing his run for the Presidency, are you aware of AMI ever paying to suppress stories?

Michael Cohen: No, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Would you say you had a good relationship with Mr. Pecker?

Michael Cohen: I would, yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you know someone named Dylan Howard?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Susan Hoffinger: Who was Dylan Howard?

Michael Cohen: Dylan Howard was an employee over at AMI.

Susan Hoffinger: What was your understanding about what his role was at AMI, if you knew?

Michael Cohen: He worked for Mr. Pecker to the same extent that I worked for Mr. Trump.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you speak with Mr. Howard in person or, generally, by phone?

Michael Cohen: I spoke to everybody in three different manners: by phone, by email, and in person.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you have Mr. Dylan's [sic] phone numbers and contacts in your contacts in your phone?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you use those numbers to contact him?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, at times, did you also communicate with Mr. Howard using that encrypted application, Signal?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: And why did you choose to do that with your communications with Mr. Howard?

Michael Cohen: For the same reason. It was a sensitive matter that we wanted to keep private.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you also communicate by text with Mr. Howard?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And sometimes by email?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Again, using your contacts that you had in your phone?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Did there come a time, in 2011, that Mr. Trump was exploring a run for the Presidency?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Can you tell us a little bit about that?

Michael Cohen: So, in 2011, I had come across, while reading the paper, a poll that stated 6 percent of all the people who had taken the poll thought Mr. Trump should be President of the United States of America. And so, I took that article, and I brought it to Mr. Trump. And I said, "What do you think?" He said, "It's interesting.

Michael Cohen: We should look into it."

Susan Hoffinger: And did he look into it in some degree in 2011?

Michael Cohen: He did.

Susan Hoffinger: Do you recall whether he spoke publicly in 2011 about exploring a run for the Presidency?

Michael Cohen: He did. That was posts I had created for him, my own website called shouldtrumprun.com. And many people came to that website. And it was further proof that his name recognition, his popularity, especially because of the hit show The Apprentice, was so strong.

Susan Hoffinger: And just to go back to the question, do you remember giving some public speech -- him giving public speeches about his considering a run for the Presidency in 2011?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Were those, if you recall, covered in the news?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Did he, ultimately, decide to run for the Presidency in 2011?

Michael Cohen: No.

Susan Hoffinger: What was your understanding why he decided not to run?

Michael Cohen: There were several large real estate projects he acquired, as well as another season of The Apprentice. And, as Mr. Trump told me, "You don't leave Hollywood. Hollywood leaves you."

Susan Hoffinger: So, he decided to stay and do that work instead?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Did there come a time, then, in June of 2015, when Mr. Trump announced that he was running for President?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And how did he make that announcement, if you recall?

Michael Cohen: I do. It was at The Atrium at Trump Tower. He came down the stairs to the lowest level. And we had set up a podium. He made the announcement and a speech.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, at the time, in June of 2015, were you -- or any time -- an official paid member of Mr. Trump's campaign?

Michael Cohen: No.

Susan Hoffinger: Nevertheless, did you assist Mr. Trump in his campaign?

Michael Cohen: So, just some colorfulness. In 2011, when Mr. Trump decided not to run, he actually promised me that he was going to do it in the next election cycle. And for years thereafter, we would talk about him running in 2015. At the very beginning, when he ultimately said, "I'm doing it," there was a lot of back and forth about which date the announcement should be. A very small group of people were attached to the campaign when it first launched.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you have some discussions directly with Mr. Trump about what your role might be in terms of assisting with his campaign?

Michael Cohen: I wasn't going to be part of it. I was just going to be a surrogate.

Susan Hoffinger: Explain what you mean by "surrogate".

Michael Cohen: Sure. "Surrogate" was someone who speaks on behalf of the candidate and defends him in the press. Speaks to the press, provides color, but not as a member of the campaign, but, rather, as an outside person. So, again, as to give the appearance that it's unbiased.

Susan Hoffinger: And that's the role that you performed for him and for the campaign?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you make public appearances for him and for his campaign?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: Tell us a little bit about that. What kind of public appearances?

Michael Cohen: I would make public appearances on television, CNN, MSNBC, ABC, whoever, CBS. I would frequently provide comment to press regarding different matters that kept popping up.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you leverage your press contacts in that way, from Mr. Trump's campaign?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Your relationships?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you also develop some relationships with some key people on behalf of the campaign who put together some kind of committees or groups for him?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Tell the jury a little bit about that.

Michael Cohen: So, while watching the rallies, I had gone to Mr. Trump, and I said, "One of the things that I notice is that it's very white. And we really need diversity. If you're going to win, you're going to need diversity." And so, I started a group called National Diversity Coalition for Trump, along with Pastor Carol Scott, an Evangelical Pastor from Cleveland, Ohio.

Susan Hoffinger: And you did that for his campaign, is that right?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you have other important contacts in the Christian Evangelical community that you sort of worked with for Mr. Trump?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you have a campaign email address, by the way?

Michael Cohen: Yes. I was given a campaign email address.

Susan Hoffinger: Around the time that the campaign began, did Mr. Trump express to you any concern about negative stories about his personal life that might affect his candidacy?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: What -- generally, what did he say, in substance?

Michael Cohen: You know, that, "When this comes out," meaning the announcement, "just be prepared. There's going to be a lot of women coming forward."

Susan Hoffinger: Now, turning back to his announcement of running for the Presidency in June of 2015, did you invite David Pecker to attend that announcement?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you invite other people, as well?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, sometime after the announcement in June, in about August of 2015, did you and Mr. Trump meet with David Pecker at Trump Tower to discuss what AMI could do for the campaign?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Where exactly did the three of you meet?

Michael Cohen: Mr. Trump's office on the 26th floor.

Susan Hoffinger: Could you tell the jury, please, what was discussed and what was agreed to at that meeting?

Michael Cohen: What was discussed was the power of the National Enquirer in terms of being located at the cash register of so many supermarkets and bodegas, that if we can place positive stories about Mr. Trump, that would be beneficial, that if we could place negative stories about some of the other candidates, that would also be beneficial.

Susan Hoffinger: Was there anything else that Mr. Pecker said he could also do for Mr. Trump's candidacy?

Michael Cohen: Yeah.

Susan Hoffinger: What, in substance, did he say?

Michael Cohen: What he said was that he could keep an eye out for anything negative about Mr. Trump, and that he would be able to help us to know in advance what was coming out and try to stop it from coming out.

Susan Hoffinger: And who did he say he would get in touch with if his -- he was able to identify those types of stories?

Michael Cohen: The answer was: Me. Mr. Trump also. Knowing my relationship with David, "The two of you should work together. And anything negative that comes , you let Michael know, and we'll handle it."

Susan Hoffinger: Now, during -- subsequent to that meeting, during the campaign, did AMI run stories that were positive for Mr. Trump?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: And did they run stories that were negative on Mr. Trump's opponents?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: And in the course of that, did AMI preview for Mr. Trump and for you some of those stories that they were gonna run in their magazines and periodicals?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Can you describe just a few that you recall that they ran, specifically to benefit Mr. Trump, some stories that were either negative on his opponents or positive for him?

Michael Cohen: So, some of the negative ones that I would receive from David or from Dylan Howard was Hillary Clinton wearing very thick glasses and some allegations that she had some brain injury. There was Ted Cruz, a photo of his father with Lee Harvey Oswald, claiming that Ted Cruz's father was involved in the assassination of JFK.

Michael Cohen: There was an article on Marco Rubio in a swimming pool with a bunch of other men, claiming that they were having a drug binge of some sort.

Susan Hoffinger: Did AMI sometimes send over the covers of some of these stories to you before they ran them?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And what did you do with that material when they sent it over to you?

Michael Cohen: Immediately showed it to Mr. Trump.

Susan Hoffinger: And for what purpose did you show it to Mr. Trump?

Michael Cohen: So that he knew that David was loyal, was on board, was doing everything that he said he was going to do in that August meeting and was actually doing it.

Susan Hoffinger: And do you recall, from time to time, when you showed Mr. Trump some of those stories, what his -- in general, his reactions were?

Michael Cohen: "That's fantastic. That's unbelievable."

Susan Hoffinger: Now, did AMI ever actually seek your input into the types of stories or the content of some of the stories that they were gonna run?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we show, please, People's Exhibit 166, which is in evidence.

Susan Hoffinger: Are you able to read that, Mr. Cohen?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Do you recognize, generally, this email?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Susan Hoffinger: Can you just tell the jury a little bit about what this email was?

Michael Cohen: This is an email from me, Trump Org, on January 6, 2016, to Barry Levine and cc'd to Dylan Howard. Barry Levine was an employee, as well, at AMI.

Susan Hoffinger: Did Barry Levine send you something in this email?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: What did he send you?

Michael Cohen: He sent to me an email that says: "Michael: Greetings and happy new year. As our readers can't get enough of Mr. Trump, we are repackaging and repurposing past material from our files and adding additional material -- of course also of a positive nature." Then goes on. There's a series of bullet points. "Donald has quietly given away" --

Susan Hoffinger: He's describing the content of some of these articles?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we blow up the top email to Barry Levine?

Susan Hoffinger: And you copied Dylan Howard on it. Read your response.

Michael Cohen: I stated: "Yes. Take out the part of the Penthouse pet Sandra as it offers nothing. Also, I would like to reword the part about Atlantic City. Let's speak tomorrow."

Note: [Whereupon, Senior Court Reporter Lisa Kramsky relieves Senior Court Reporter Laurie Eisenberg, and the transcript continues on the following page.]

Note: [The following proceedings are continued from the preceding page.]

Note: [Continued direct examination by Susan Hoffinger.]

Susan Hoffinger: Why did you ask AMI to remove the Penthouse pet reference?

Michael Cohen: I thought it would be negative to Mr. Trump as, again, it dealt with women and Penthouse.

Susan Hoffinger: And did AMI agree to make the edits that you suggested?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: What is the title of the story?

Susan Hoffinger: Can you just scroll down just a little bit. Thank you so much.

Note: [Displayed]

Susan Hoffinger: The title of that story -- can you see what the title of that story was going to be, was it: "The Trump that Nobody Knows?"

Michael Cohen: Yes. It was going to go under the headline "The Donald Trump Nobody Knows."

Susan Hoffinger: And, I'm sorry, would you say again what the date of this email was?

Michael Cohen: January 6th of 2016.

Susan Hoffinger: Okay.

Susan Hoffinger: And can we now take that down and put up People's 152 in evidence.

Note: [Displayed]

Susan Hoffinger: And can we direct your attention to the article entitled "The Trump Nobody Knows."

Susan Hoffinger: And maybe you can just center on that.

Note: [Displayed]

Susan Hoffinger: Did this article actually come out --

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: -- that you spoke to AMI about?

Michael Cohen: I'm sorry.

Susan Hoffinger: That's all right. You said that the email that you sent was either January 6th of 2016 -- and what's the date of this article here?

Michael Cohen: It was posted on January 13th of 2016.

Susan Hoffinger: So, about a week later, AMI ran the article with your suggestions?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: And is this an example of your working with AMI to get articles out that benefitted Mr. Trump's campaign?

Michael Cohen: It is an example.

Susan Hoffinger: And this was consistent with what was discussed at the Trump Tower meeting with Mr. Pecker and Mr. Trump?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Thank you. We can take that down.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, in the Fall of 2015, did you come to learn of a negative story being circulated by a former doorman at Trump Tower?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: And how did you learn of that story?

Michael Cohen: I was told of the story by either David Pecker or Dylan Howard.

Susan Hoffinger: And, very briefly, what was the nature of the story that they indicated to you was out there circulating?

Michael Cohen: That there was a love child.

Susan Hoffinger: Actually, I think I take my question back about the circulating, that they heard about the doorman who had this story, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: After you learned of the story, did you speak to Mr. Trump about it?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: Why did you do that?

Michael Cohen: Well, I went to him immediately to advise him that there was a story, because it was a negative story for him, and to get his direction on what he wanted me to do.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you indicate to him at the time the name of the employees who were referenced in this potential story?

Michael Cohen: Yes. I provided him with all of the information.

Susan Hoffinger: And did it involve actually two employees at The Trump Organization?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Who were married to each other?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Did Mr. Trump -- can you describe your conversation that you had with Mr. Trump when you advised him of this? What did he tell you to do?

Michael Cohen: He told me to: Make sure that this story doesn't get out. You handle it.

Susan Hoffinger: Did he ask you, also, to do anything with respect to the affected employees?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: What did he say, in substance?

Michael Cohen: He asked me to speak to them and let them know it's being taken care of.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, what did you do in terms of, at that point, in terms of making sure that the story didn't get out?

Michael Cohen: I worked with David Pecker and Dylan Howard.

Susan Hoffinger: And you worked with them to do what?

Michael Cohen: In order to obtain the story, all of the life rights to the story.

Susan Hoffinger: Who did you understand was going to either purchase or try to take care of -- well, take care of purchasing the life rights to the story or otherwise making sure that the story didn't get out?

Michael Cohen: David Pecker.

Susan Hoffinger: And, along the way, did either Dylan Howard or David Pecker update you about what they were doing with respect to that story?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: And as the matter progressed and you got updates from Dylan Howard or David Pecker, did you update Mr. Trump about the matter?

Michael Cohen: Immediately.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, at some point, did you learn that AMI had entered into an Agreement with the doorman regarding this story?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: What did you learn, just briefly, about what the general terms were of the Agreement that AMI entered into with this particular doorman?

Michael Cohen: That they were going to pay $30,000. They were executing an Agreement with the doorman in order to obtain the life rights to this story.

Susan Hoffinger: And when you say "to obtain the life rights," was it to publish the story or not publish the story?

Michael Cohen: It was to not publish the story.

Susan Hoffinger: But to control the life rights so that nobody else could publish it?

Michael Cohen: Correct. Take it off the market.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, did you update -- actually, when Dylan Howard and Mr. Pecker told you they were going to do that, they were going to acquire the life rights for $30,000, did you tell them that Mr. Trump would be grateful?

Michael Cohen: Absolutely.

Susan Hoffinger: And when you spoke to Mr. Trump about it, was he grateful?

Michael Cohen: Absolutely.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, did AMI at some point send you the Agreement -- their agreement with the doorman for those life rights for $30,000?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you review it?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: Why did you review it?

Michael Cohen: Well, I reviewed it to ensure that Mr. Trump was fully protected. I also asked them to send it to me so that I could show Mr. Trump that it's being taken care of.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you -- when you reviewed that Agreement, did you provide AMI with any feedback about the terms in the Agreement?

Michael Cohen: I did.Senior Court Reporter

Susan Hoffinger: What did you tell them?

Michael Cohen: Ummm, I thought that there needed to be a clause in there, a significant penalty for a million dollars per violation of any of the terms of the Agreement to ensure that the doorman knew not to go ahead and to talk about this matter.

Susan Hoffinger: So, you suggested that there be a heavy hammer to make sure that he didn't break the terms of the Agreement?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you also suggest some other term involving perpetuity for this Agreement?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Can you explain that?

Michael Cohen: What I found was that the Agreement had what I considered to be an end date to it. And so, rather, I said why not just -- let's make this in perpetuity.

Susan Hoffinger: What does that mean, "in perpetuity?"

Michael Cohen: It means that it's forever. That he owns the document -- they own the story forever. And it can never come out.

Susan Hoffinger: And did AMI agree to include that term as well in the Agreement?

Michael Cohen: He did.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we put up, please, People's 165 in evidence.

Note: [Displayed]

Susan Hoffinger: And can you -- do you recognize that email, first of all?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Susan Hoffinger: Who is it from and who is it to?

Michael Cohen: It's from Dylan Howard on December 19th of 2015 to me at the Trump Org, with the subject headline of "Update." It reads: "Michael, it was remiss of me not to contact you yesterday. We were on deadline for the magazines. Nevertheless, I wanted to confirm that the source executed an Addendum to the Agreement with a liquidated damages clause.

Michael Cohen: He has been compensated accordingly. Cheers, Dylan."

Susan Hoffinger: Can we also put up now People's 155 in evidence.

Note: [Displayed]

Susan Hoffinger: Is it possible to blow that up just a little bit.

Note: [Displayed]

Susan Hoffinger: Do you recognize that, Mr. Cohen?

Michael Cohen: I do, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: What is that?

Michael Cohen: This is the Amendment that I was just describing.

Susan Hoffinger: And is that the Amendment that contains the million-dollar liquidation clause and the clause about it continuing in perpetuity?

Michael Cohen: Yes, that would be Sections 2 and 3 of the Amendment.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, once that was accomplished by AMI and they included the terms that you wanted to protect Mr. Trump, did you advise Mr. Trump that you had gotten that done?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Why did you tell him that?

Michael Cohen: Again, in order to ensure that he knows that David's doing exactly what he said he would. Also for credit.

Susan Hoffinger: In terms of credit, did you tell him that you got the million dollars put in and the in perpetuity clause put in?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Why did you do that?

Michael Cohen: In order to get credit for accomplishing the task.

Susan Hoffinger: And was -- what was Mr. Trump's reaction when you told him that?

Michael Cohen: It's great. "That's great."

Susan Hoffinger: Now, is it your understanding that AMI bought the life rights to the doorman's story as part of what Mr. Pecker had agreed to at the Trump Tower meeting with you and Mr. Trump in August 2015?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: You could take that down. Thank you so much.

Susan Hoffinger: Let me direct your attention now to June of 2016. And around that time, did you learn that a woman by the name of Karen McDougal was looking to sell a story regarding her relationship with Mr. Trump?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: And how did you learn that?

Michael Cohen: Again, I received a call from David Pecker or Dylan Howard.

Susan Hoffinger: And what, generally, did they tell you, just briefly, in substance, about what this story was about?

Michael Cohen: That she's a Playboy Playmate and that there is a story that is looking to be sold on the street -- to news outlets about a relationship that she had had with Mr. Trump.

Susan Hoffinger: And when you learned of the story, what, if anything, did you think about its potential impact on Mr. Trump's Presidential campaign?

Michael Cohen: Significant.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you tell Mr. Trump what you had learned from AMI about Karen McDougal?

Michael Cohen: Immediately after I got off the phone with AMI.

Susan Hoffinger: And can you tell us about the conversation you had with Mr. Trump after learning about that story?

Michael Cohen: So, I went to the office, knocked on it, I said: "Boss, I got to talk to you." He said: "Come in." I went in. I told him about what I had just learned. I asked him if he knew who Karen McDougal was, if he knows anything about the story. His response to me was: "She's really beautiful." I said: "Okay. But there is a story that's right now being shopped."

Susan Hoffinger: And did you draw on any -- based on your experience with Mr. Trump, did you draw any conclusion based on his response to you?

Todd Blanche: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Susan Hoffinger: Did Mr. Trump ask you to take any action with respect to the story?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: What did he ask you, in general, to do?

Michael Cohen: Make sure it doesn't get released.

Susan Hoffinger: What did you do as a result? What did you take that to mean you should do?

Michael Cohen: We need to -- we need to acquire the story. And so I went ahead and I reached back out to both Dylan Howard as well as to David Pecker.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, during the time period of about June of -- maybe June 16th or so of 2016 to August 5th of 2016, did you communicate frequently, regularly, with Mr. Pecker and Mr. Howard regarding Karen McDougal?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Why did you do that?

Michael Cohen: Again, ummm, the purpose is to stop the story from being sold or marketed to an outside source.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you want to make sure that AMI was doing that?

Michael Cohen: Absolutely.

Todd Blanche: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Susan Hoffinger: How did you communicate -- well, let me ask you a question: Did AMI regularly update you about what was happening with their negotiations in terms of the story?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And was that consistent with what they had -- David Pecker had agreed to do at Trump Tower, to notify you if matters like this were happening?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: How did you communicate with David Pecker and Dylan Howard during this time?

Michael Cohen: Again, it would either be by phone, text, email, app.

Susan Hoffinger: Okay. When you say "app", sometimes using the Signal app?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am, I'm sorry. The Signal app.

Susan Hoffinger: That's okay. Let me just finish the question and then you answer, because the court reporter also needs to get it down.

Michael Cohen: I'm sorry.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you use for this transaction that you were working with AMI, did you use the Signal app?

Michael Cohen: I believe so.

Susan Hoffinger: And why was that?

Michael Cohen: Again, because of the nature of the issue, to make sure that it remained private.

Susan Hoffinger: At various times when you were receiving updates from either Dylan Howard or David Pecker about the progress with Karen McDougal, did you update Mr. Trump frequently?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we put up now, please, People's Exhibit 177A, which is also in evidence.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, I'm just going to ask you: Do you recognize these texts between yourself and Dylan Howard during this time period from about June 16th of 2016 to November 1st of 2016?

Michael Cohen: I think it says here June 20th of 2016.

Susan Hoffinger: My apologies. Do you recognize these texts during the time period that's referenced in this exhibit?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Susan Hoffinger: Let's take a look at, first, please, the text with Dylan Howard on June 16th of 2016.

Note: [Displayed]

Susan Hoffinger: Can you read out for the jury all of the texts from June 16th of 2016. And along the way, you can tell the jury what they refer to and what they mean.

Michael Cohen: So, this is a June 16th of 2016 communication between Dylan Howard and myself, and it states: "Meeting will be on Monday, per their terms. Dylan."

Susan Hoffinger: And what's your response?

Michael Cohen: My response back was: "Understood. Thank you for everything."

Susan Hoffinger: What did you understand this was about in terms of the meeting on their terms?

Michael Cohen: This is about meeting with Karen McDougal and her people.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, let me direct your attention -- what is -- again, what is the date of this?

Michael Cohen: The date is June 16th of 2016.

Susan Hoffinger: And can we take that down for a moment and show People's Exhibit 262 in evidence.

Note: [Displayed]

Susan Hoffinger: I want to -- do you recognize these texts with Keith Schiller, between yourself and Keith Schiller?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, you recall that you told the jury that sometimes you spoke to or contacted Keith Schiller in order to get in touch with Mr. Trump?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we look at Page 2, please,Senior Court Reporter lines 16 to 20, dated June 16th of 2016. Can you see if we can cull those out.

Note: [Displayed]

Susan Hoffinger: Mr. Cohen, can you read those texts between yourself and Keith Schiller on that same day, June 16th of 2016?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am. So, this is from me to Keith Schiller, asking: "Can we speak? I need you."

Susan Hoffinger: And what does he respond?

Michael Cohen: He then responds -- I didn't receive --

Susan Hoffinger: His response?

Michael Cohen: I didn't receive a response back. And so, I followed it up with another that says: "You there?" He then responds to me: "On Dallas." I think he meant in Dallas. I then respond to him: "Where's The Boss?" Which, of course, referenced Mr. Trump. He then responds to me: "Next to me." And then, I then ask: "Is he free to speak?"

Susan Hoffinger: Why are you trying to reach Mr. Trump on this date of June 16, 2016?

Michael Cohen: Regarding the Karen McDougal matter.

Susan Hoffinger: Was it an update that -- in response to an update that you had just received from Dylan Howard about a meeting withSenior Court Reporter Karen McDougal's people?

Michael Cohen: Yes, that I thought was important.

Susan Hoffinger: Is this an example of you contacting Mr. Trump to give him updates about what was progressing with Karen McDougal?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: You can take that down. Can we now put up People's 349 in evidence.

Note: [Displayed]

Susan Hoffinger: And take a look at the call on 6/16 of 2016. Do you recognize these? These are calls between yourself and Mr. Trump, summary calls. Do you see a call between the two of you at 6:51 p.m. --

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: -- for 2 minutes and 31 seconds. Did you have that call with Mr. Trump right after you asked Keith Schiller if he was available -- meaning Mr. Trump -- to speak?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And what do you believe that you discussed with Mr. Trump on that call?

Michael Cohen: The updates that I received on the Karen McDougal matter.

Susan Hoffinger: Thank you.

Susan Hoffinger: You can take that down.Senior Court Reporter Can we go back now, please, to People's Exhibit 177A in evidence. And can we cull out the texts on June 20th of 2016. And blow those up for Mr. Cohen.

Michael Cohen: Thank you.

Note: [Displayed]

Susan Hoffinger: Can you start with the texts from Dylan Howard that says: "I'm about to meet her. Her name is Karen McDougal."

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: "Former Playboy Playmate."

Michael Cohen: So, I received a series of messages. This one is dated Monday, June 20th of 2016, whereby Dylan Howard sends to me: "I'm about to meet with her. Her name is Karen McDougal, former Playboy Playmate." I then respond to Mr. Howard: "Okay. We need to speak." He then responds to me: "Yes." I then -- he then responds to me again: "When we break." And I respond back: "Okay." He then sends to me a response: Spoke -- it says "spike" but it means "Spoke to DP" -- referencing David Pecker -- "We just broke.

Michael Cohen: I'm wrapping up with them. And then we will convene a three-way call between us all to sort this out. Understand I've got this locked down for you." I won't let it get out of my grasp -- "I won't let it out of my grasp."

Susan Hoffinger: Now, did you insist, at this time, on having a call with Dylan Howard right after he met with Karen McDougal?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: And why did you do that?

Michael Cohen: Because I needed to get an update so I could provide it to Mr. Trump.

Susan Hoffinger: And shortly after these updates from Mr. Howard, did you actually have a call with both Dylan Howard and David Pecker to find out about their interview with Karen McDougal?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: And what was the substance of what they told you during that three-person call about progress with Karen McDougal?

Michael Cohen: That they believed that they have this under control, as Dylan had stated to me: "I will get this locked down for you. And I won't let it out of my grasp."

Susan Hoffinger: Did Dylan Howard tell you what his opinion was about whether he believed that Karen McDougal had had a relationship with Mr. Trump?

Todd Blanche: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Susan Hoffinger: Was it important for you to have that call with Dylan Howard and David Pecker?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And that's to make sure that things were being taken care of for Mr. Trump?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you have another call later that night with Mister -- with Dylan Howard to have some further conversations about the progress of the deal?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, you said you did update Mr. Trump on the progress at that point with Karen McDougal?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: And do you know whether at that time that update was either in person or by telephone?

Michael Cohen: I don't recall.

Susan Hoffinger: I'm going to direct your attention now to a little bit later in June, a little later in June of 2016, maybe a week or so, around the same time. Did you -- were you present for a conversation that Mr. Trump had directly with David Pecker about the Karen McDougal matter?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Where were you when you were present for, and overheard, that conversation?

Michael Cohen: In Mr. Trump's office.

Susan Hoffinger: And who else was in the office besides yourself and Mr. Trump?

Michael Cohen: [No response.]

Susan Hoffinger: It was just the two of you?

Michael Cohen: I believe so, yes.Senior Court Reporter

Susan Hoffinger: And did he have a call at that point with Mr. Pecker?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: How did he make that call?

Michael Cohen: He had the call put through, and he had a speaker box on his desk, and instead of lifting up the phone, he used the speaker box so I was able to hear.

Susan Hoffinger: And can you tell the jury about what you recall from that conversation that Mr. Trump had with Mr. Pecker?

Michael Cohen: He asked him how things were going with the matter. And David said, "We have this under control. And we will -- we will take care of this."

Susan Hoffinger: Was there a discussion on that call about how much it might cost to buy this story and who might pay for it?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Just, in substance, what was that conversation?

Michael Cohen: So, David had stated that it's going to cost them $150,000 to control the story, to which Mr. Trump replied: "No problem. I will take care of it."

Susan Hoffinger: Was there an understanding about who would initially purchase that story?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And who was discussed on that call that would purchase that story?

Michael Cohen: AMI was going to lay out the funds, and as Mr. Trump had stated to David: "I will take care of it."

Susan Hoffinger: And what did you understand that to mean?

Michael Cohen: He was going to pay it back.

Susan Hoffinger: But it wasn't -- was it described at that point how that might occur?

Michael Cohen: No, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: After that call, did you then have a call or call Mr. Pecker?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And tell us a little bit about that conversation that you had with Mr. Pecker?

Michael Cohen: I just wanted to make sure that I was being updated regarding the entire matter.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you let him know on that call that you had overheard that conversation that he had with Mr. Trump?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, let's put back up, if we could, please, 177A, Mr. Cohen's texts with Dylan Howard. And now the texts on July 28th of 2016 through July 29th of 2016. And let's see if we can cull those out for Mr. Cohen to read.

Note: [Displayed]

Michael Cohen: So it's Thursday, July 28th of 2016. It's from me to Dylan Howard: "Can you call me?" Dylan Howard responds back: "I've not heard back from ourSenior Court Reporter guy yet so no update. Let me call him this a.m. and get latest. Does that work?"

Susan Hoffinger: Who did you understand his "guy" to be?

Michael Cohen: I believe it was Keith Davidson.

Susan Hoffinger: And who was Keith Davidson in relation to this matter?

Michael Cohen: Keith Davidson is an attorney that was representing Ms. McDougal in this transaction.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you understand from Dylan Howard that Mr. Davidson was doing the negotiating with AMI for Ms. McDougal?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: Objection, Judge.

Susan Hoffinger: Can you continue reading --

Juan Merchan: I'm sorry?

Todd Blanche: I'm sorry. Objection.

Juan Merchan: Overruled.

Susan Hoffinger: Okay.

Michael Cohen: Same date, Thursday, the 28th of July, 2016. I sent a text to Dylan Howard: "Yes. And thank you."

Susan Hoffinger: Again, if you could read them just as they apply to July 29th?

Michael Cohen: Sure. He then expresses to me: "They rejected the offer. Told them to come back to me." It says "my," but it's "me by EOD" -- which means end of day -- "with a realistic number." "He agreed to that. He fears she has been convinced to tell her story at ABC. And really wants to. I implored my guy to GET IT DONE." All caps. "He's getting back to me."

Susan Hoffinger: Is that the last text?

Michael Cohen: No.

Susan Hoffinger: I'm sorry. I apologize.

Michael Cohen: I then respond back to him: "Okay." To which he then responds to me: "We are having a video conference with her next week to outline the opportunities we will present to -- we will present her to sign up with us." I then ask: "Do you know what day?" And he responds to me: "Monday or Tuesday." And I respond again: "Okay.

Michael Cohen: Thank you."

Susan Hoffinger: Now, why were you pressing for this information from Dylan Howard?

Michael Cohen: So several things here. One, I wanted to know what the number was, because I would have to report that to Mr. Trump. When they stated that they are having a video conference with her next week to outline the opportunities, I needed to know what day, again, so that I could update Mr. Trump, and he could have all the necessary information.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you also speak to David Pecker around this time about how things were moving along in the negotiation with Karen McDougal and her lawyers?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Was there some particular pressure that you felt at this point that AMI should get this done?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: What was that?

Michael Cohen: There was the campaign, and we were concerned that this story was going to find its way to ABC, meaning ABC News.

Susan Hoffinger: Now --

Susan Hoffinger: We can take that down. Thank you.

Susan Hoffinger: -- let me direct your attention now to August 5th -- well, withdrawn. At some point in August now of 2016, so shortly after those texts, did you learn that indeed an Agreement had been finalized between AMI and Karen McDougal?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And how did you learn that?

Michael Cohen: I was told by David Pecker and Dylan Howard.

Susan Hoffinger: And what was your understanding from them about what the terms of that Agreement were going to be?

Michael Cohen: The terms were going to be compensation to her in the amount of $150,000, as well as they were going to provide her with 24 penned articles that would bear her name, as well as she was going to be on two covers of one of the various magazines that they owned.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you have a conversation just between yourself and David Pecker about the parameters of this Agreement with Ms. McDougal?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Did Mr. Pecker tell you that he felt that the Agreement was bulletproof?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And what did you understand that to mean?

Michael Cohen: That they got it. That this is locked down. We prevented the story from being released on ABC News, and effectively the story has now been caught.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you tell -- did you update Mr. Trump on that conversation?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you tell him that you had been told by David that the Agreement was bulletproof?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: What was Mr. Trump's reaction to hearing that an Agreement had been signed and done and that it was bulletproof?

Michael Cohen: Fantastic. Great job.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, did, at some point, Keith Davidson, the attorney for Karen McDougal, reach out to you after the Agreement had been finalized with AMI?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Were you familiar at that time with who Keith Davidson was?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And how did you know him at that time?

Michael Cohen: I had worked with Keith Davidson back in 2011 when there was a story that was out that dealt with Stormy Daniels, and in that story -- it was on a website called TheDirty.com, that Stormy actually wanted to be taken down and we had worked together to effectuate that.

Susan Hoffinger: To take the story down from The Dirty?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, let me have you take a look, please, at People's Exhibit 62 in evidence.

Note: [Displayed]

Susan Hoffinger: By the way, your communications with Keith Davidson were also by phone, also by text?

Michael Cohen: Yes. It was by phone, email, text.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you also sometimes communicate with him on an encrypted application?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Taking a look at People's 62. Do you recognize that email?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Susan Hoffinger: And what was this email about?

Michael Cohen: It's an August 5th, 2016 email sent by Keith Davidson to me and it states: "Michael, please call me at your convenience. Thanks."Senior Court Reporter

Susan Hoffinger: And was this after AMI had signed the deal with Karen McDougal?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you end up having a call with Keith Davidson about the matter?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: Could you describe, just generally, the substance of the call?

Susan Hoffinger: You can take that down. Thank you.

Susan Hoffinger: Actually, do you know what, let me just ask you, when you received this email, did you then call Keith Davidson --

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: -- as per his request?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: All right. So tell us, if you would just briefly, what the conversation was with Keith Davidson?

Michael Cohen: Great job. The Boss, I mean, obviously very happy about it. The matter is now resolved.

Susan Hoffinger: Did Keith tell you that he had resolved the matter?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And that was you telling him that The Boss would be very pleased and thank you and good job?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: What's your understanding of why Keith Davidson reached out to you after this deal was concluded?

Todd Blanche: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, after AMI finalized the deal with Karen McDougal and paid the $150,000 for the life rights and also for the other that she was going to be doing, did you have any conversations with Mr. Pecker about Mr. Trump reimbursing AMI for the money that AMI put out?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Tell us a little bit about that?

Michael Cohen: So David had asked me when he should anticipate receiving or being paid back the 150 thousand dollars. He needed to get the 150 thousand dollars, that he wanted the 150 thousand dollars back because it was too much money for him to hide from the CEO of the parent company. And he had also just laid out 30 thousand dollars previously.

Michael Cohen: So he was putting pressure on me to speak to Mr. Trump and to get the money back.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you have several conversations with Mr. Pecker where he urged you to try to move it along and get him repaid?

Michael Cohen: Yes. I -- I don't know if I would characterize it as urge as much as he insisted.

Susan Hoffinger: Was he upset about it?

Michael Cohen: Very.Senior Court Reporter

Susan Hoffinger: So directing your attention now to about September of 2016. Did you have lunch with Mr. Pecker where he pressed you further on that matter?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Can you tell us a little bit about that matter?

Michael Cohen: So he asked me if I would meet him at his favorite Italian restaurant, and I went to meet with him. And, again, he expressed his anger that: I need to get this money back. And I said: Look, Mr. Trump told you that he would pay you back, so he'll pay you back.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you -- after the lunch meeting with Mr. Pecker where he was, as you say, upset about not being repaid, did you talk to Mr. Trump about that? Did you inform him of that?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: And what did Mr. Trump say, in substance, about David Pecker's concerns about getting it paid?

Michael Cohen: Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you discuss with Mr. Trump David Pecker's request for that money back on one occasion or more than one occasion?

Michael Cohen: Several occasions.

Susan Hoffinger: Around the same time, did you have any conversations with Mr. Trump regarding other stories that AMI may have had in the past and some concerns about that?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Can you tell the jury a little bit about that?

Michael Cohen: So David had expressed to me that, obviously, the relationship with Mr. Trump goes back many, many years and there is a file drawer or a locked drawer, as he described it, where files that relate to Mr. Trump existed. And, at that point in time, David was being considered for the position of CEO at Time, Inc., Time Magazine.

Michael Cohen: And one of the concerns that I had, that I expressed to Mr. Trump, was if he goes, there is a series of papers there that relate to you.

Susan Hoffinger: And what was your concern, specifically, with respect to those stories and Mr. Pecker leaving AMI?

Michael Cohen: Well, I didn't know what those stories were, and nobody was discussing that with me, but that they would be open for use.

Susan Hoffinger: Meaning that other people might get their hands on them?

Michael Cohen: Yes. Because we didn't know who the potential CEO or replacement would be.

Susan Hoffinger: And was Mr. Trump concerned about that at that point as well?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you discuss with Mr. Pecker those concerns about whatever other stories might -- AMI might have in that locked drawer?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And what did Mr. Pecker say?

Michael Cohen: You could technically buy them. We will figure out a way for you to take control over them.

Susan Hoffinger: And around the same time, were you having some discussions with David Pecker about purchasing from AMI those life rights to Karen McDougal's story?

Michael Cohen: Yes. That was all part of the same transaction.

Susan Hoffinger: So, let me direct your attention now to September 6th of 2016. Did you record a conversation that you had with Mr. Trump about purchasing from AMI the life rights to Karen McDougal's story and these other stories that AMI might have?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, during the time, the ten years that you worked for Mr. Trump, how many conversations with him did you tape?

Michael Cohen: None other.

Susan Hoffinger: So this was the only one?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Why did you feel it was important to tape this one conversation?

Michael Cohen: It was so I could show it to David Pecker, and that way he would hear the conversation so that he would know that we are going to be paying him -- Mr. Trump is going to be paying him back because it was -- it became a regular conversation between the two of us.

Susan Hoffinger: That he needed to be paid back?

Michael Cohen: And I also wanted him to remain loyal to Mr. Trump.

Susan Hoffinger: So how did you go about recording this conversation with Mr. Trump?

Michael Cohen: I had my cell phone in my hand, and I put it on voice memo. All Apple iPhones have it. And I hit record. And I walked in.

Susan Hoffinger: Walked in where?

Michael Cohen: To Mr. Trump's office.

Susan Hoffinger: And where did you put your phone when you recorded this conversation with Mr. Trump?

Michael Cohen: It was in my hand.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you sit down to talk to him? Were you standing when you had this conversation with him or were you seated, if you can recall?

Michael Cohen: I don't recall.

Susan Hoffinger: About how far away were you from Mr. Trump when you made this recording using your phone?

Michael Cohen: On the opposite side of his desk.

Susan Hoffinger: To your knowledge, was Mr. Trump aware that you were recording this conversation?

Michael Cohen: No, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Can you hand this to the witness, please. Thank you.

Susan Hoffinger: I'm handing you a thumb drive that, among other exhibits, contains People's 246, which is a recording, and People's 248, a transcript.

Michael Cohen: Thank you. THE

Court Officer: You're welcome.

Susan Hoffinger: Have you previously reviewed that recording, People's 246, and the transcript, People's 248, on that thumb drive?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: How do you know that you reviewed those two exhibits previously?

Michael Cohen: Because it has my initials on it.

Susan Hoffinger: And you say it has -- would it be the thumb drive?

Michael Cohen: I'm sorry. The thumb drive has my initials on it.

Susan Hoffinger: Okay. And does it also have the date or just your initials?

Michael Cohen: It does.

Susan Hoffinger: You don't have to pull out the date, but it has the date and your initials. Now, People's 246, the recording of that conversation that you taped Mr. Trump on, on September 6th, 2016, is that an exact copy of the original audio recording that you made on your phone?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And whose voices are on that audio recording?

Michael Cohen: Several people.

Susan Hoffinger: Who are they?

Michael Cohen: Mr. Trump. Mine. Rhona Graff.

Susan Hoffinger: When you say "Rhona Graff," was she in and out?

Michael Cohen: Rhona Graff came in and out, but you hear -- you certainly hear her voice. She's executive assistant, again, to Mr. Trump.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, what generally, before we listen to it, is discussed that's on that taped audio recording?

Michael Cohen: That I had been working with Allen Weisselberg in terms of --

Susan Hoffinger: Well, let me stop you a second.

Michael Cohen: I'm sorry.

Susan Hoffinger: Just in terms of generalities, when you first walked in, was Mr. Trump on the phone?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Does the audio recording capture some of his conversation on the phone?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you discuss partly the purchase of materials from AMI?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you also discuss another matter with him before you got to that?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: What generally was that?

Michael Cohen: Charleston. I was referring to a piece of property in Charleston.

Susan Hoffinger: Okay. Was it also generally a discussion of some divorce papers --

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: -- that you had with Mr. Trump at the time?

Michael Cohen: Yes, that's another topic that came up.

Susan Hoffinger: Is that audio recording, People's 246, a true and accurate representation of the conversation you had with Mr. Trump on that day, on September 6th of 2016?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Okay. Now, I mentioned a transcript, People's 248, that you also reviewed on that thumb drive. Did you compare that closely with the recording of the conversation?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, is that transcript just a portion of what's on the recording?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And is it -- does it reflect the portion of the recording related to the purchase of those materials from AMI?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: And is that transcript a true and accurate representation of that portion of the conversation regarding the purchase of materials from AMI?

Michael Cohen: Yes, there was one change that was made to one word.

Susan Hoffinger: Okay. And is what is currently the transcript that you reviewed --

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: -- that you reviewed carefully against the tape, is it true and accurate in terms of the words that are spoken by both yourself and Mr. Trump?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: I would like to now play, please, one time through for the jury, People's 246. And if we can play it once in its entirety. Thank you.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, Mr. Cohen, let me ask you, the first two minutes or so of the conversation were not related to the Karen McDougal matter, is that right?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Susan Hoffinger: That's when Mr. Trump was on the phone and when you were talking to him about some other divorce papers and Charleston, is that right?

Michael Cohen: Yes, as well as Pastor Mark Burns.

Susan Hoffinger: So, I'm now going to ask for us to listen to just some portions. We are going to stop and start it. I'm going to ask you a few questions.

Susan Hoffinger: So, if we could play now the recording from minute 2 and 4 seconds to 2 and 15 seconds.

Susan Hoffinger: And then I will ask you a few questions.

Note: [Audiotape being played in open court at this time.]

Susan Hoffinger: First of all, who is "our friend David?"

Michael Cohen: It's referring to David Pecker.

Susan Hoffinger: And what did you mean by "I need to open a company regarding the transfer of all that information." What were you talking about?

Michael Cohen: Well, to open up an LLC, and the LLC would be the beneficial owner of all of the information that was contained in that drawer that David was referencing.

Susan Hoffinger: And all that information, including also the Karen McDougal matter?

Michael Cohen: As well as the Karen McDougal matter.

Susan Hoffinger: What was the reason for talking about opening up a company?

Michael Cohen: In order to have separation. Keeping it away from Mr. Trump.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, why was it important to keep it away from Mr. Trump, the purchase of that information?

Michael Cohen: For privacy purposes and for the benefit of Mr. Trump. Hmmm.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, you didn't refer to Mr. Pecker by his full name, you just said "David." Why didn't you use his full name? And was this sort of typical for this conversation?

Michael Cohen: It wasn't necessary. Mr. Trump knew who I was referring to. It was an ongoing conversation that we had been having.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we play now the recording from 2 minutes and 15 minutes to 2 minutes and 21 seconds. Thank you.

Note: [Audiotape being played in open court at this time.]

Susan Hoffinger: You mentioned within your conversation with Mr. Trump "Allen Weisselberg?"

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Who was he at the time?

Michael Cohen: Allen Weisselberg was the Chief Financial Officer of the Trump Organization.

Susan Hoffinger: And why did you tell Mr. Trump that you were setting up the LLC and discussing it with Allen Weisselberg?

Michael Cohen: Because Mr. Trump had previously directed me to speak with Allen Weisselberg about getting this matter handled.

Susan Hoffinger: And why were you letting Mr. Trump know that you had been in discussion with Mr. Weisselberg about this?

Michael Cohen: Because we are going to need money, and we are going to need to open up the LLC and to resolve this issue.

Susan Hoffinger: And Mr. Weisselberg's role at the time, you said, was --

Michael Cohen: Chief Financial Officer. He handled all of the finances. It was -- every penny that came in or out went through Allen's office.

Susan Hoffinger: And so, this was partly why Mr. Trump directed you to work with him, and this was not unusual for you to work with Mr. Weisselberg on financial matters regarding Mr. Trump, is that right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, what did you understand Mr. Trump to mean when he said "what do we have to pay for this? What do we got to pay for this?"

Michael Cohen: We were referring to the $150,000 that was advanced by AMI in order to purchase the life rights of Karen McDougal.

Susan Hoffinger: So, when Mr. Trump said: "What do we got to pay for this? One fifty?" What was your understanding about the state of Mr. Trump's knowledge at that point about how much money it was going to take to purchase this?

Todd Blanche: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Overruled.

Michael Cohen: He already knew, based upon conversations with David, which is why he mentioned the number "150."

Susan Hoffinger: Now, can we play the rest of the tape through. Just to the end. Thank you.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, what was the significance of "all that stuff" that was mentioned?

Michael Cohen: "All that stuff" is referencing the information that David Pecker had accumulated over the years of Mr. Trump that was in that alleged locked door -- or drawer.

Susan Hoffinger: And including also the Karen McDougal story?

Michael Cohen: And including Karen McDougal.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, what was the conversation about "someone may be getting hit by a truck." What was that about it?

Michael Cohen: As I had said before, Allen Weisselberg was being considered -- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. David Pecker was being considered for the CEO position of another -- of Time Inc., and the concern was the information, so "all the stuff" refers to that.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, you mentioned the word "financing," and Mr. Trump asked you about that. Can you explain that?

Michael Cohen: That was not the best usage of the word, what I really meant was funding, not financing.

Susan Hoffinger: And what did you mean by what you had -- what needed to be funded?

Michael Cohen: How much money needed to be paid.

Susan Hoffinger: Paid to who?

Michael Cohen: Paid to David Pecker, AMI.

Susan Hoffinger: Okay. And is that what you understood by, "We will have to pay him something?"

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: By "we have to pay him something?"

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: What did you understand Mr. Trump to mean by saying, "Pay with cash?"

Michael Cohen: Well, to pay in green, which would, obviously, be one way to avoid any type of a paper transaction, but that's not what I thought was the best way to do it.

Susan Hoffinger: And so, is that why you said, "No?"

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you want to take a break, your Honor?

Juan Merchan: It's up to you. Is this a good time?

Susan Hoffinger: Yes.

Juan Merchan: Okay.

Susan Hoffinger: Thank you.

Juan Merchan: All right. Jurors, let's go ahead and take our morning recess. I will see you in about 15 minutes. You may step out.

Court Officer: All rise.

Note: [Jury exits.]

Juan Merchan: You may be seated. Sir, you can step out.

Michael Cohen: Thank you.

Note: [Recess taken, after which time Principal Court Reporter Susan Pearce-Bates relieved Lisa Kramsky as the official court reporter.]

Lieutenant: All rise. Part 59 is back in session.

Juan Merchan: Mr. Blanche, in the past my practice has always been when there is a tape or something like that produced into evidence, I normally give some sort of limiting instruction along the lines of, Jurors, I just want you to know that the transcript is not evidence. The transcript is just an aid to assist you and it is the tape that is evidence.

Juan Merchan: No one has requested that instruction. Do you want to leave it like that, or would you want me to give it?

Todd Blanche: We would.

Susan Hoffinger: I believe the transcript is in evidence.

Juan Merchan: It is in evidence as an aid, and I am going to give that instruction.

Todd Blanche: If your Honor can give it even right now, since we finished that part of the testimony, that would make sense.

Juan Merchan: Sure. Let's bring the witness back, please.

Lieutenant: Witness entering.

Note: [Whereupon, the witness entered the courtroom and was properly seated.]

Juan Merchan: You are still under oath, Mr. Cohen.

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Note: [M-I-C-H-A-E-L C-O-H-E-N, herein, called as a witness, being previously sworn, was examined and testified further as follows.]

Juan Merchan: Let's get the jury, please.

Lieutenant: All rise. Jury entering.

Note: [Whereupon, the jury entered the courtroom and was properly seated.]

Juan Merchan: You may be seated.

Court Clerk: Case on trial continued. All jurors are present and properly seated.

Juan Merchan: Jurors, just one quick instruction before we continue with the testimony. You heard the tape played and you have also seen a transcript.

Note: I just want to remind you that the evidence in the case is the tape itself. The transcript has been offered to you merely as an aid to assist you in understanding what is in evidence, and that is the tape. The transcript is also in evidence, but, again, it is the tape itself that is the evidence.

Susan Hoffinger: Thank you, your Honor.

Note: [Continued direct examination by Susan Hoffinger.]

Susan Hoffinger: Now, Mr. Cohen, when we ended off before the break, I was asking you about Mr. Trump saying something about paying in cash. Why did you think it was a bad idea for Mr. Trump's suggestion that this be paid in cash?

Michael Cohen: Because we needed to acquire the information, the documents, and I believed that the proper way to do it would be by check and make it appear to be a proper transaction.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, at the end of the tape it cuts off, and there is a voice that's heard at the end of the tape before it cuts off. Whose voice is that?

Michael Cohen: It's my voice.

Susan Hoffinger: And what do you recall about why that recording cut off that way with your voice?

Michael Cohen: Because I received an incoming phone call.

Susan Hoffinger: And what do you understand you were saying in that last piece when you hear your voice?

Michael Cohen: Hello, are you there?

Susan Hoffinger: Now, why did you -- when you tried to take that call, you said the incoming call you thought was coming in, did the recording of your conversation with Mr. Trump end at that point?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And why did you try to take that call instead of continuing to tape the conversation with Mr. Trump?

Michael Cohen: I must have believed it was an important phone call.

Susan Hoffinger: Was there another reason also that you were comfortable ending the tape?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Tell us about that, please.

Michael Cohen: I didn't want to record more. I already had enough that I would have been able to show David Pecker so as to convince him that he was going to receive the $150,000 back.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, let's put up, please, for Mr. Cohen, what's in evidence, a page from People's Exhibit 400. The page that's Bates ending 2726, please.

Note: [Displayed]

Susan Hoffinger: Now, Mr. Cohen, have you had a chance to review this record, this AT&T record regarding your call history?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And do you recognize it to be an AT&T record of calls to or from your cell phone ending in 0114?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Does it appear to show an incoming call at around the time that your recording of Mr. Trump cuts off?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And does that record indicate a call at around that time that looks like it came in and perhaps went to voicemail?

Michael Cohen: It says so, yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And do you recall when you tried to pick up that call, do you recall whether it connected or went to voicemail?

Michael Cohen: I don't recall.

Susan Hoffinger: You can take that down, please. Can we take a look now at a page of what's in evidence as People's Exhibit 263, a page with a Bates ending 69559?

Note: [Displayed]

Susan Hoffinger: Does that appear to be a contact from your phone records, from your phone contacts?

Michael Cohen: It is.

Susan Hoffinger: Have you had a chance to review that against those AT&T records?

Michael Cohen: I have.

Susan Hoffinger: And does that indicate the number or the person who is attached to the number of that incoming call at around the time that the recording cut off?

Michael Cohen: It does.

Susan Hoffinger: And who does that number come back to, according to your contacts?

Michael Cohen: It comes back to Kathy Battle, who is the Branch Manager over at Capital One Bank.

Susan Hoffinger: So, it is your understanding that that was the call that came in --

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: -- based on the review of these records?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: You can take that down. Thank you.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, after the audio ended, you ended the audio recording by trying to pick up this call, did you continue some conversation with Mr. Trump?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And what was the gist of the conversation that you continued with Mr. Trump after the recording ended?

Michael Cohen: I am going to head over to Allen Weisselberg's office, and I will get back to him with more of an update.

Susan Hoffinger: So, was there a really substantial conversation after the end of that taped recording?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And when you say, yes, was it a substantially long conversation?

Michael Cohen: No, it was not substantial.

Susan Hoffinger: And at that point, as you -- withdrawn. You mentioned that the point of this recording was so that you could convince Mr. Pecker that Mr. Trump had agreed to repay the money?

Michael Cohen: To appease him that he was going to receive the money back.

Susan Hoffinger: Was there any reason to have any real further conversation with Mr. Trump about this at that time?

Michael Cohen: No.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, I am going to ask you to please put up People's 247 also in evidence.

Note: [Displayed]

Susan Hoffinger: Now, Mr. Cohen, this is metadata from your phone regarding the taped -- the audio tape of your conversation with Mr. Trump on September 6th of 2016. I want to ask you a question. After you made that audio recording using your phone, did you ever alter that recording?

Michael Cohen: No.

Susan Hoffinger: And is that recording exactly the same as the day that you made it on September 6th of 2016?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: You can take that down. Thank you.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, I want to go back to your conversation with Mr. Trump on that audio recording where you mentioned having spoken with Allen Weisselberg about setting this whole thing up. Do you remember that?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Susan Hoffinger: I just want to go back to you -- was it typical for you to discuss financial matters with Allen Weisselberg?

Michael Cohen: It was typical, too, for everybody to discuss financial matters with Allen Weisselberg.

Susan Hoffinger: And that was why?

Michael Cohen: Because he was the Chief Financial Officer of the company and was a long serving, loyal employee to Mr. Trump.

Susan Hoffinger: And so, was Mr. Weisselberg, to your knowledge, in charge of the finance and accounting functions at The Trump Organization?

Michael Cohen: Yes. One additional thing.

Susan Hoffinger: Yes, sir.

Michael Cohen: It was also because Mr. Trump would direct me to go speak to Mr. Weisselberg.

Susan Hoffinger: Was that unusual either --

Michael Cohen: No.

Susan Hoffinger: -- to direct you to speak to Mr. Weisselberg about financial transactions?

Michael Cohen: No.

Susan Hoffinger: Did -- to your understanding, did Mr. Weisselberg report directly to Mr. Trump at The Trump Organization?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And I think you said Mr. Weisselberg was a long-standing executive employee there for many years?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Where was Mr. Weisselberg's office located in relation to Mr. Trump's office?

Michael Cohen: Also on the 26th floor, towards the back.

Susan Hoffinger: Whose office was closer to Mr. Trump's, yours or Mr. Weisselberg's?

Michael Cohen: Well, initially, it would have been pretty similar, but the second office that I moved into, I was.

Susan Hoffinger: What was your relationship like with Mr. Weisselberg at the time?

Michael Cohen: It was very good.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you observe how frequently Mr. Weisselberg interacted with Mr. Trump?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And what did you observe?

Michael Cohen: It was a regular basis.

Susan Hoffinger: And from your experience working at The Trump Organization, would a deal of this magnitude, a $150,000 deal, have been done at The Trump Organization without Allen Weisselberg?

Todd Blanche: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Overruled.

Michael Cohen: No, not -- it wasn't even a deal of this magnitude. It was any deal would end up going through Allen. Allen handled all the finances coming in and out.

Susan Hoffinger: Can you describe, generally, the conversation you had with Mr. Weisselberg about the McDougal transaction?

Michael Cohen: So, I went to Allen's office. I expressed to him that we need funding of $150,000 to consummate this transaction. Allen then said to me: Well, if we do it from a Trump entity, that kind of defeats the purpose because the point is not to have the Trump name affiliated to this at all. It's really to create a barrier.

Michael Cohen: And so, he asked me to think about ways that we could raise the $150,000.

Susan Hoffinger: Before we get to that for a moment, in terms of opening up a separate LLC to handle it, did you have a conversation with Mr. Allen Weisselberg about that?

Todd Blanche: Objection.

Juan Merchan: You can answer.

Michael Cohen: No. I just told him I was going to open up a LLC.

Susan Hoffinger: Was there a discussion about doing that to make it more difficult to track directly to either Mr. Trump or The Trump Organization?

Michael Cohen: It was in order to keep it separate.

Susan Hoffinger: And, approximately, how many conversations do you think you had with Mr. Weisselberg about the McDougal transaction?

Michael Cohen: Maybe 10, 12.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, did there come a time that you had some conversations and began working with someone named Daniel Rotstein associated with AMI in terms of effectuating this transfer of the rights from AMI to an LLC?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And who was Daniel Rotstein, to your knowledge?

Michael Cohen: He is an employee over at AMI.

Susan Hoffinger: And, by the way, you had Mr. Rotstein's contact in your phone as well?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you communicate with him by phone?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: And by email?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you also on some occasions communicate with him by encrypted applications?

Michael Cohen: I believe so.

Susan Hoffinger: And why did you do that with him?

Michael Cohen: In order to keep the matter secret.

Susan Hoffinger: So, let's show now, please, just to the witness, the Court and counsel, People's Exhibit, 209 for identification.

Note: [Displayed]

Susan Hoffinger: Do you recognize that document on your screen, sir?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Susan Hoffinger: What do you recognize it to be?

Michael Cohen: This is a communication from Daniel Rotstein to me by encrypted app Signal.

Susan Hoffinger: Are those a variety of communications over a number of days with Mr. Rotstein?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: By encrypted app Signal?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Is this an exact copy of those communications between yourself and Mr. Rotstein using that encrypted app on the dates that are reflected in this record?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: I offer People's Exhibit 209 in evidence.

Todd Blanche: No objection.

Juan Merchan: Accepted into evidence.

Note: [Displayed]

Susan Hoffinger: Thank you.

Susan Hoffinger: Let me direct your attention to the first -- sorry, to September 7th of 2016. There is a text at 8:34 a.m.

Susan Hoffinger: Thank you for blowing that up for the jury to see and for Mr. Cohen to see.

Susan Hoffinger: Can you read what's in that communication and explain what it is?

Michael Cohen: This is just the communication from Daniel Rotstein to me stating, please find possible names, and he listed five different possible corporation names that he was going to use as the recipient of the Assignment Agreement.

Susan Hoffinger: And what is the date of that first communication that Mr. Rotstein had with you? What date was that?

Michael Cohen: September 7th of 2016.

Susan Hoffinger: And was that just one day after you had taped the conversation with Mr. Trump about setting up an LLC to purchase the information from AMI?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: So, you started working with Mr. Rotstein promptly the next day on that matter?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Just to clarify something, People's 209 are screenshots or photos of the communications you had with Mr. Rotstein?

Michael Cohen: It was a screenshot sent to me, yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, you mentioned an Assignment Agreement. What is the Assignment Agreement that he was referencing there?

Michael Cohen: What he was referencing was to assign the life rights of Karen McDougal to the LLC entity that was being created.

Susan Hoffinger: So, it would be an assignment from AMI to the company that you set up?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, if we can scroll down just a little bit.

Note: [Displayed]

Susan Hoffinger: Do you see some additional calls in September following that communication?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And then I will just ask you to read the communication on September 30th.

Susan Hoffinger: And if we can blow that up.

Note: [Displayed]

Michael Cohen: September 30th of 2016, approximately -- well, 1:36 p.m.: I will be at your office in a few minutes.

Susan Hoffinger: And do you know what that communication was about?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: What was it?

Michael Cohen: It was about the Assignment Agreement.

Susan Hoffinger: Was there a plan to sign it on that day?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: We can take that down. Thank you. I want to now show to the witness People's -- to the witness, counsel and the Court only, People's Exhibit 210 for identification.

Note: [Displayed]

Susan Hoffinger: Do you recognize that document?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Susan Hoffinger: What do you recognize it to be?

Michael Cohen: It is an email from Daniel Rotstein to me on September 23rd of 2016.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we scroll down to the next page of that exhibit?

Note: [Displayed]

Susan Hoffinger: What is attached to that exhibit? Do you recognize it?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Susan Hoffinger: Is it a Form Assignment of License Agreement?

Michael Cohen: It's a non-filled in Assignment of License Agreement.

Susan Hoffinger: And other than the redactions that are in the email in terms of redacting email addresses, is this an exact copy of an email from Mr. Rotstein to you on September 23rd of 2016, attaching that non-filled in Form Assignment of Licensing Agreement?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: I offer People's Exhibit 210 in evidence.

Todd Blanche: No objection.

Juan Merchan: 210 is accepted into evidence.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we display that for the jury now, please? Can we look at that second page?

Note: [Displayed]

Susan Hoffinger: Is that an assignment template agreement that Mr. Rotstein had mentioned in his messages with you earlier on the screenshot exhibit, the screenshot messages?

Michael Cohen: It is.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, did you go ahead --

Susan Hoffinger: You can take that down.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you go ahead and form the LLC, the company, that was going to handle the payment to AMI for the life rights to Karen McDougal's story?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And, at the time, what was the name of the company that you formed to handle that transfer of rights?

Michael Cohen: Resolution Consultants LLC.

Susan Hoffinger: And can we put up now, just for the witness, counsel and the Court, please, People's Exhibit 215 for identification.

Note: [Displayed]

Susan Hoffinger: Do you recognize this document?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Susan Hoffinger: What do you recognize it to be?

Michael Cohen: It is an email from Patty, who is an employee over at Delaney Corporate, an entity that incorporates for you, to me with the attachment Resolution Consultants LLC, and it states this is what I would submit for filing.

Susan Hoffinger: And does she attach a Certificate of Formation for Resolution Consultants to be filed?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Other than some of the redactions to the email, is this an exact copy of the email with the attached Certificate of Formation for Resolution Consultants that you received from Patty at Delaney Corp. on that day?

Michael Cohen: It is.

Susan Hoffinger: I offer in evidence People's Exhibit 215.

Todd Blanche: I have no objection.

Juan Merchan: Accepted into evidence.

Susan Hoffinger: Thank you, your Honor. You can show that to the jury now.

Note: [Displayed]

Susan Hoffinger: What is the date of formation of Resolution Consultants LLC?

Michael Cohen: September 30th of 2016.

Susan Hoffinger: What was your purpose on September 30, 2016 of forming Resolution Consultants?

Michael Cohen: To use this entity for the assignment of the McDougal matter, as well as the other information.

Susan Hoffinger: You can take that down now. Can we now put up People's Exhibit 162, which is in evidence?

Note: [Displayed]

Susan Hoffinger: Do you recognize that document, sir?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Susan Hoffinger: What is that?

Michael Cohen: This is an executed Assignment of Licensing Agreement between AMI as the signer to Resolution Consultants LLC dated September 30th of 2016, and executed by David Pecker and myself.

Susan Hoffinger: And that's your signature there?

Michael Cohen: It is.

Susan Hoffinger: And do you recognize David Pecker's signature?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Can you just describe for the jury, generally, what were the terms of this Assignment Agreement?

Michael Cohen: As it states in the document: For good and valuable consideration, the signer does hereby sign and transfer to the assignee, successors and assigns all of his rights, benefits and obligations to the license agreement.

Susan Hoffinger: Just, in general, without reading it for the jury, there is a lot of legal language in there, does it represent the transfer of those rights from AMI to Resolution Consultants?

Michael Cohen: Yes. The transfer of the McDougal life rights, as well as the other documents.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, why does this agreement reference $125,000 instead of $150,000, which was the payment to Karen McDougal?

Michael Cohen: So, David had expressed to me that we are going to reduce it from 150 to 125, on the basis that 125 was going to represent the life rights because they were engaged with Karen McDougal for two covers, as well as 24 penned articles, that the compensation to her for that was going to be $25,000. That's what they would have on their books claiming their contract with her was for.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, at this time, when you worked out this Assignment Agreement with AMI, between AMI and Resolution Consultants, had you and Allen Weisselberg yet worked out the logistics of where that $125,000 was going to come from?

Michael Cohen: No.

Susan Hoffinger: And who did you understand was, ultimately, going to pay the $125,000 for the life rights to that material?

Michael Cohen: Mr. Trump.

Susan Hoffinger: Were you planning on owning the life rights to that story?

Michael Cohen: No, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Why not?

Michael Cohen: I had no reason to own -- no need to own the life rights. What I was doing, I was doing at the direction and for the benefit of Mr. Trump.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, in signing that agreement, around the time that you signed that agreement with AMI, did you have a conversation with Mr. Trump about doing so?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we put up, please -- you can take that down and put up People's Exhibit 349 and reference the call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen on September 29th of 2016.

Note: [Displayed]

Susan Hoffinger: Do you see a call there, sir, for about seven minutes and fourteen seconds?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And what did you discuss -- what do you think you discussed on the phone with Mr. Trump during that call?

Michael Cohen: The Karen McDougal matter.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you discuss with him, specifically, whether you were going to be signing this agreement and finalizing the assignment rights?

Michael Cohen: Yes. I gave him a complete and total update on everything that transpired the day before.

Susan Hoffinger: Why did you speak to him the day before you signed that agreement?

Michael Cohen: Because it was when I was speaking with David Pecker regarding the transfer and the assignment.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you want to let him know that you were getting it done?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Susan Hoffinger: Why did you speak to him the day before you signed it?

Michael Cohen: In order to let him know that it was being taken care of, that the matter was going to be resolved, and this conversation, obviously, to let him know that it is being resolved.

Susan Hoffinger: You can take that down now. Can you please put up People's Exhibit 161 in evidence?

Note: [Displayed]

Susan Hoffinger: Do you recognize this document, Mr. Cohen?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Susan Hoffinger: What is it?

Michael Cohen: This is a document. It is, as stated, an invoice from Investor Advisory Services Inc., with an invoice number of 2016-203, dated September 21st of 2016.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you receive this document at some point?

Michael Cohen: Yes, I did.

Susan Hoffinger: Who did you receive it from?

Michael Cohen: I believe Daniel Rotstein.

Susan Hoffinger: What did you understand was the purpose of this document?

Michael Cohen: The purpose was to reflect $125,000 that was for the assignment.

Susan Hoffinger: Was it an invoice for the payment of that 125?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: And let me direct your attention to the description of services. It says, flat fee for advisory services for $125,000. Do you see that?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Susan Hoffinger: Was that description a truthful description about this transaction?

Michael Cohen: No, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: In truth, what was the $125,000 payment supposed to be for?

Michael Cohen: For the life rights of Karen McDougal.

Susan Hoffinger: And what's your understanding about why you got an invoice, or why this invoice was from a company called, Investment Advisory Services instead of AMI directly?

Michael Cohen: I never knew who they were. I still, to this day, don't. It was clearly just to create separation in order to mask the transaction.

Susan Hoffinger: You can take that down. Thank you.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, ultimately, you signed this Assignment Agreement and you received this invoice. Ultimately though, did the company, Resolution Consultants, end up purchasing the Karen McDougal materials and the other materials from AMI?

Michael Cohen: No.

Susan Hoffinger: What happened?

Michael Cohen: Well, David Pecker contacted me, and stated that it was no longer necessary to have Mr. Trump pay the $125,000. I asked him, why? Satisfied, because now I would report to Mr. Trump that he wouldn't have to pay that amount of money, which would make him happy. And the reason was because the Karen McDougal front cover on Men's Health magazine had sold more copies than they had not only anticipated, I think that they had ever -- the way David expressed it to me, that they had ever sold, and they had made a lot of money on that.

Michael Cohen: And that it was no longer necessary because he didn't need to bury the $125,000. He also then had a second cover to use McDougal on, as well as the 24 additional articles that she was -- that was going to be penned with her name on it. So, he felt that it was, even for the 150,000, it was an excellent business deal.

Susan Hoffinger: Did he tell you what to do with that Assignment of Rights Agreement that you had signed?

Michael Cohen: He did.

Susan Hoffinger: What did he tell you to do?

Michael Cohen: He told me to rip it up. Forget it.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you update Mr. Trump after that phone call about what David Pecker had told you about ripping up the agreement?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And what was Mr. Trump's reaction?

Michael Cohen: It was great.

Susan Hoffinger: Why did you understand, it was great?

Michael Cohen: He doesn't have to pay 125 or $150,000.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you have some understanding of what might happen to the other materials that you discussed with David Pecker in terms of the locked drawer and the other materials that were out there?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: What was your conversation or understanding about what would happen with those?

Michael Cohen: David was not being considered for Time Magazine so, he was going to stay at AMI and that there was no need to do any transfer. Plus, he also didn't believe that any of the documents that existed in that locked drawer were detrimental to Mr. Trump.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, in total, approximately, how many conversations would you estimate you had with Mr. Trump about the purchase of Karen McDougal's account and story?

Michael Cohen: Quite a few.

Susan Hoffinger: And were those conversations on the phone, in person or both?

Michael Cohen: Both.

Susan Hoffinger: And, in total, approximately, how many conversations do you think you had with AMI, with David Pecker and Dylan Howard, about the Karen McDougal deal?

Michael Cohen: Also a substantial amount.

Susan Hoffinger: By the way, did you ever play for Mr. Pecker the recorded conversation that you had with Mr. Trump where he said he understood that he would have to pay the $150,000?

Michael Cohen: No.

Susan Hoffinger: Why not?

Michael Cohen: He didn't ask me to. I had told him that I had spoken to Mr. Trump and that he is going to do it. I told him I could, but I just never played it.

Susan Hoffinger: In other words -- withdrawn. After the conversation you had with Mr. Trump, that you taped on September 6th of 2016, did you move promptly ahead the next day with Daniel Rotstein to finalize the agreements then?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Was there any need to play that recording for Mr. Pecker?

Michael Cohen: No.

Susan Hoffinger: I would like to direct your attention now to October 7th of 2016. Do you remember where you were on that day?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Where were you?

Michael Cohen: I was in London.

Susan Hoffinger: How do you remember that you were in London?

Michael Cohen: Well, I went to London for my daughter's 21st birthday, as well as for my anniversary.

Susan Hoffinger: And while you were in London, did you become aware of the release of what's known as the Access Hollywood tape?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And how did you become aware of that tape coming out or that it had come out?

Michael Cohen: I received a phone call.

Susan Hoffinger: Who did you receive a phone call from?

Michael Cohen: From Hope Hicks.

Susan Hoffinger: Who was Hope Hicks at the time?

Michael Cohen: Hope Hicks was Communication Director for the Trump campaign.

Susan Hoffinger: Do you also recall receiving, at around that time, an email from Steve Bannon about the potential release of the Access Hollywood tape?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And who was Steve Bannon at the time?

Michael Cohen: Campaign Manager for the Trump campaign.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you have Mr. Bannon's email and contact information in your phone?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we take a look now, please, just for the witness, counsels and the Court, People's Exhibit 218?

Note: [Displayed]

Susan Hoffinger: Do you recognize -- do you recognize this email?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Susan Hoffinger: And who is this an email between, between you and someone else?

Michael Cohen: This is an email between me and Steve Bannon, as well as -- Bannon, as well as Hope Hicks, Jason Miller, Kellyanne Conway, Dave Bossie.

Susan Hoffinger: Was this an email that was forwarded to you from Steve Bannon?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Does it relate to the release of the Access Hollywood tape?

Michael Cohen: It does.

Susan Hoffinger: And is it a true and accurate copy of the email and the forwarding of the information from Steve Bannon to you?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: I offer in evidence now the rest of People's 218. Part of it was previously in evidence, now the entire exhibit.

Todd Blanche: Just the same objection before.

Juan Merchan: Noted. Accepted into evidence.

Susan Hoffinger: Can you -- you can put that up on the screen. Can we start at the bottom of the email, which would be the earliest email.

Note: [Displayed]

Susan Hoffinger: And can you tell the jury what you understand this bottom email to be?

Michael Cohen: Yes. This is an email from David Fahrenthold of the Washington Post dated Friday, October 7th, 2016 at 1:29 p.m., and it's to Hope Hicks with the subject matter of, Urgent, Washington Post query.

Susan Hoffinger: And just, in general, what is he communicating to Hope Hicks, and what is he asking her for?

Michael Cohen: He is asking her for comment in regard to the leak of the tape from Access Hollywood.

Susan Hoffinger: And is there a transcript of the Access Hollywood tape attached to the email from David Fahrenthold to Hope Hicks?

Michael Cohen: There is.

Susan Hoffinger: And is David Fahrenthold in that email asking for some comments from Hope Hicks?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: And does Hope Hicks then forward that email to some other folks?

Michael Cohen: She does.

Susan Hoffinger: And who does she forward it to?

Michael Cohen: She sends it to Jason Miller, David Bossie, Kellyanne Conway and Steve Bannon.

Susan Hoffinger: What were those people's roles at the time?

Michael Cohen: All of them had roles at the Trump campaign.

Susan Hoffinger: And then, following, what does Hope Hicks say in that email that she forwards on to those folks involved in the campaign?

Michael Cohen: Need to hear the tape to be sure. Then followed by, deny, deny, deny.

Susan Hoffinger: And is that -- does that get forwarded -- now, as we scroll down, does that now get forwarded by Mr. Bannon on to you?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: And can you read --

Susan Hoffinger: Or if you can blow it up. Thank you.

Note: [Displayed]

Susan Hoffinger: -- Mr. Cohen's email to Steve Bannon saying, please call me?

Michael Cohen: Call me.

Susan Hoffinger: And why did you ask Mr. Bannon to call you?

Michael Cohen: Because I wanted to ensure that things were being properly taken care of in order to protect Mr. Trump.

Susan Hoffinger: And can we scroll up to the next email by Mr. Cohen when he asks about damage control.

Note: [Displayed]

Susan Hoffinger: Can you read your email, Mr. Cohen?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am. Again, it's from me to Steve Bannon, October 7th, Urgent, Washington Post query. And my statement to him, my text to him, it's all over the place. Who is doing damage control here?

Susan Hoffinger: Why is it that you asked that of Mr. Bannon?

Michael Cohen: In order to protect Mr. Trump.

Susan Hoffinger: Were you concerned about the impact of what this tape may have on Mr. Trump's campaign?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Thank you. You can take that down.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, on October 8th you were still in London, is that right?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Susan Hoffinger: And while you were in London, did you have several calls with Hope Hicks about this matter, the Access Hollywood tape?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: And some other matters as well?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you have her cell phone information in your contacts as well?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: And you used that to communicate with her?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: At one point, did Mr. Trump join a call with yourself and Hope Hicks?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: On that day, on October 8th?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you also have another separate call with Mr. Trump on October 8th of 2016?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Let's put up People's Exhibit 349, please, and the two calls between Michael Cohen and Mr. Trump on 10/8/16.

Note: [Displayed]

Susan Hoffinger: Does that accurately reflect the two calls that you had with Mr. Trump on the evening of October 8th of 2016?

Michael Cohen: It does.

Susan Hoffinger: And do you remember -- do you have a separate memory of where you were and what you were doing when you had these phone calls with him?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: What were you doing?

Michael Cohen: I was with my family and friends in London.

Susan Hoffinger: London. Were you having dinner?

Michael Cohen: I was.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you step out to take these calls?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: And what, if any, discussion do you remember with Mr. Trump about the Access Hollywood tape and the strategy for dealing with it?

Michael Cohen: He wanted me to reach out to all of my contacts with the media. We needed to put a spin on this. And the spin that he wanted put on it was that this is locker room talk, something that Melania had recommended, or at least he told me that that's what Melania had thought it was. And use that in order to get control over the story and to minimize its impact on him and his campaign.

Susan Hoffinger: And what, if anything, did you do at that point to try to assist the campaign with that effort?

Michael Cohen: I reached out to members of the media.

Susan Hoffinger: And, in addition -- when you say you reached out to members in the media, did you have conversations with them?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: Along the lines of the conversations of how to minimize the impact?

Todd Blanche: Objection, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Susan Hoffinger: You mentioned that you reached out to the press. Did members of the press also reach out to you?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you have conversations with the press about this matter?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: What was your understanding about why the press reached out to you about this?

Michael Cohen: Well, sum and substance of the recording is quite damaging and they wanted comment.

Susan Hoffinger: And were you somebody that they fairly frequently came to and asked for comment on matters related to Mr. Trump?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we now, please, show -- can we take that down and show People's Exhibit 257 in evidence? And can we blow up the communications, the texts, on October 8th of 2016?

Note: [Displayed]

Susan Hoffinger: First, Mr. Cohen, do you recognize these texts?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Susan Hoffinger: Who are they with?

Michael Cohen: These are text communications between myself and Chris Cuomo. At the time he was an anchor, journalist with CNN.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you have his cell phone number in your contacts?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you use that number to communicate with him by phone or text?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And do you recall these texts with Mr. Cuomo at the time?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Susan Hoffinger: Can I direct your attention, I think we have them up, actually. The five texts on October 8, 2016, could you read them, please, for the jury?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am. On October 8, 2016, I received a text message from Chris Cuomo stating, you going to defend him? I then responded back, I am in London. To which I think I also stated, I have been asked by everyone to do shows starting Tuesday. And Tuesday was when I would be back in New York. I then followed through and said, not sure what I will do. And Chris Cuomo's comment back to me, will be too late.

Michael Cohen: He is dying right now. And by, he, he meant -- he was referring to Mr. Trump.

Susan Hoffinger: What was your understanding about what that meant that, he is dying right now?

Michael Cohen: That this is a tremendously negative story in regard to the Trump campaign.

Susan Hoffinger: And about how long before the election was this at that time?

Michael Cohen: Approximately, a month.

Susan Hoffinger: And was this one example of some communications you had at the time with members of the press about the Access Hollywood tape?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: What did you understand as a result of those communications and others about the impact of the Access Hollywood tape on the campaign?

Todd Blanche: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained as to form. Please rephrase.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you have an understanding at the time, based on all of these communications, about the potential impact of the Access Hollywood tape on Mr. Trump's campaign?

Todd Blanche: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Overruled.

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: What was your understanding?

Michael Cohen: That this was going to be significantly impactful, especially with women voters.

Susan Hoffinger: Thank you. You can take that down. Can we now put up People's Exhibit 167 in evidence?

Note: [Displayed]

Susan Hoffinger: Do you recognize this email?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Susan Hoffinger: Can you explain -- first, tell us who the email is with, who it's between and what it is about?

Michael Cohen: So this is an email from Dylan Howard on October 8, 2016, to me with a CC to David Pecker. The subject line is, Link. It says, Evening. The only story was this posted in October of 2006, before AMI owned it, and he is referring to the old Radar Magazine. The tape was not part of the story that existed online.

Michael Cohen: I suggest it would have been lost during the many site changes over the years. Nevertheless, I have deleted the text story. It no longer exists. And he attaches a hyperlink of that story.

Susan Hoffinger: Tell the jury what that's about, if you can flush that out a little bit.

Michael Cohen: The title of it was Donald Trump, Playboy Man, and it talks about the audio clip, recorded phone conversation between Trump and gossip, Chaunce Hayden, stating that it provides some glimpse into just how exacting the real estate blowhard standards are regarding women.

Susan Hoffinger: So, let me ask you a question. Did you learn at some point that there was this article called, Donald Trump, Playboy Man on Radar Online?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: Who owned Radar Online?

Michael Cohen: At the time I didn't know. At the time I made the communication, it was AMI in control of David Pecker.

Susan Hoffinger: And when you found out about this article being up on Radar Online, did you ask David Pecker or Dylan Howard to do something about it?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: What did you ask them do to?

Michael Cohen: Immediately take it down.

Susan Hoffinger: Why did you ask them to take it down?

Michael Cohen: Because it was negative to Mr. Trump. It would impact the campaign.

Susan Hoffinger: Were you concerned about the release of this information, in particular, because of the release of the Access Hollywood tape?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And so, you said Dylan Howard, as referenced here, took the article down, is that right?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you update Mr. Trump to let him know that that article had been taken down?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: Do you believe that you communicated that to him in one of the phone calls you had with him on October 8th of 2016?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And why did you tell him?

Michael Cohen: I told him for, again, so he would know that the task, or the situation has been handled, to get credit for it because here I am in London with my family for two important events, my daughter's 21, my anniversary, and I wanted David Pecker to get credit as well.

Susan Hoffinger: Thank you. You can take that down.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, do you recall having several calls in the evening of October 8th with David Pecker and also with Dylan Howard?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you have a number of calls with them that night?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Do you recall what was discussed with each of them, in general, that night?

Michael Cohen: The Access Hollywood tape.

Susan Hoffinger: And was it discussed, also, the Playboy online article?

Michael Cohen: As well as the Playboy.

Susan Hoffinger: Did there also come a time that night where one of them indicated to you that a woman named Stormy Daniels was out looking to sell her story publicly?

Michael Cohen: Yes. That conversation came up as well.

Susan Hoffinger: Did that come up with Dylan Howard?

Michael Cohen: I believe it was Dylan Howard.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, did you know, at the time when he advised you about that about who Stormy Daniels was?

Michael Cohen: I am sorry?

Susan Hoffinger: That's okay. I will say it one more time. When Dylan Howard told you on the evening of October 8th of 2016, that Stormy Daniels was out looking -- well, her manager was out looking to sell her story, did you know who Stormy Daniels was at that time?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: How did you know who she was?

Michael Cohen: Because it referenced back to the 2011 scenario that I had dealt previously with David Pecker on -- I am sorry, with Keith Davidson on -- in order to have a story removed from TheDirty.com.

Susan Hoffinger: And so, hearing now after the Access Hollywood tape release that her story might come out again, what, if anything, did you think about the potential impact that might have on the campaign?

Todd Blanche: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Overruled.

Michael Cohen: Catastrophic. That this is horrible for the campaign.

Susan Hoffinger: I will take you back for a minute now to 2011, when you first learned about Ms. Daniels' account of her encounter with Mr. Trump. Had you learned at that time in 2011 about what Ms. Daniels' did for a living?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: What did you hear at that time in 2011 about what she did for work?

Michael Cohen: That she was an adult film star.

Susan Hoffinger: And this came up, again, I think you mentioned because it was an article on TheDirty.com at the time?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Susan Hoffinger: And you worked with Keith Davidson to get that article taken down?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: In 2011, when you were engaged in doing that, in getting the article taken down, did you have a conversation with Mr. Trump about Stormy Daniels?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Can you tell us, in general, the gist of that conversation?

Michael Cohen: After I received the information from Dylan Howard, I immediately went to Mr. Trump's office, knocked on the door, said, Boss, I got to speak to you. And I told him about the conversation, the sum and substance of the conversation that I just had with Dylan Howard. And I asked him if he knew who she was.

Michael Cohen: He told me that he did. And I stated about the story that existed on TheDirty.com, that they had a relationship that occurred during a golf outing going back to, like, 2006. And I told him that one of the things that, you know, we need to do is we need to, obviously, take care of it. We need to absolutely do it, take care of it.

Note: [Whereupon, Principal Court Reporter Susan Pearce-Bates was released by Senior Court Reporter Theresa Magniccari.]

Note: [Continued direct examination by Susan Hoffinger.]

Susan Hoffinger: Did he also tell you about meeting her?

Todd Blanche: Objection.

Susan Hoffinger: Did Mr. Trump also tell you anything about having met her at the golf tournament back in 2006?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: What did he tell you?

Michael Cohen: He told me that he was playing golf with Big Ben Roethlisberger, the football player, and they had met Stormy Daniels and others there. But she liked Mr. Trump, that women prefer Trump even over someone like Big Ben.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you ask him at that time in 2011 whether he had had a sexual encounter with Stormy Daniels?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: Did he answer you directly?

Michael Cohen: No, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: What did he say? Did he say anything in response to that?

Michael Cohen: No, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Did he mention anything about what she looked like?

Michael Cohen: He said she was a beautiful woman.

Susan Hoffinger: Let me go back to your conversations with Mr. Davidson about taking that article down from TheDirty.com. Did you also have some conversations with the General Counsel of Life & Style about what he might do if that article wasn't taken down?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: What was the substance of that conversation?

Michael Cohen: I would file an immediate lawsuit against him.

Susan Hoffinger: Ultimately, when you and Keith Davidson were able to get that article down and to make sure -- actually, let me withdraw and go back. The General Counsel you spoke to at Life & Style, were they involved in putting out a different -- another article at around that time, separate from TheDirty.com?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And those conversations were about that separate article, meaning In Touch magazine, and making sure that it didn't come out in that magazine?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Susan Hoffinger: Thank you. After you succeeded in making sure that the In Touch article didn't come out, and Keith Davidson was working to take down the article on TheDirty.com, did you update Mr. Trump to let him know that it had been taken care of?

Michael Cohen: I did, and gave the credit actually in that case to Keith Davidson, who was the one who filed and sent papers to TheDirty.com to have it removed.

Susan Hoffinger: As a result of your efforts and Keith Davidson's efforts, did that article -- either article in 2011, get any traction in 2011, meaning, was it out there much?

Michael Cohen: No, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: So, let me now move past 2011. Between that in 2011 and 2016, when you found out from Dylan Howard that Stormy Daniels' story had resurfaced again, in between that time, had you heard anything more about the Stormy Daniels matter?

Michael Cohen: Nothing.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, when you learned on October 8th from Dylan Howard that the Stormy Daniels story had resurfaced, did you also learn from Mr. Howard that there was an attorney who would be representing Stormy Daniels in the matter?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: What did he tell you?

Michael Cohen: Keith Davidson, he was going to be representing Stormy Daniels.

Susan Hoffinger: And was that the same lawyer who had represented her in 2011 that you worked with?

Michael Cohen: Yes. We had, obviously, a positive result.

Susan Hoffinger: So let me ask to, please, put up again 177A, Mr. Cohen's texts with Dylan Howard.

Note: [Displayed]

Susan Hoffinger: Can you take a look at the texts on October 9, 2016?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Actually, if you are able to, on these texts, could you read them to the jury, please.

Michael Cohen: I am sorry?

Susan Hoffinger: Could you read these to the jury?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Are these all dated on October 9, 2016?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: If you would read them to the jury.

Michael Cohen: This is from Dylan Howard to me, stating: Emailed you. Then he also forwarded a second one, stating: Keith will do it. Let's reconvene tomorrow.

Susan Hoffinger: Who did you understand "Keith" to be?

Michael Cohen: Keith Davidson.

Susan Hoffinger: Continue, if you would, please.

Michael Cohen: Then I responded back to him: Thank you. Followed it then by another text communication advising that Resolution Consultants LLC is the name of the entity that I formed a week ago. To which I then responded again: Whenever you wake, please call my cell. Because of the difference in the time zone.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, why did you tell Mr. Howard that you had formed Resolution Consultants, an entity, just the week before?

Michael Cohen: So that would be the name of the entity that we would use in order to purchase the life rights to the Stormy Daniels' matter.

Susan Hoffinger: Thank you. You can take that down.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you return to New York from London on approximately October 10, 2016?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you have some further text communications with Keith Davidson and Dylan Howard on that date?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Let's put up 178A, please. And, specifically, I believe there are two texts. If we can float up a little so Mr. Cohen can read them.

Note: [Displayed]

Susan Hoffinger: Now, who are these texts between or among?

Michael Cohen: So, from Dylan Howard to me, on Monday, October 10th. And it states: Keith/Michael, connecting you both in regards to that business opportunity. Spoke to the client this a.m. and they're confirmed to proceed with the opportunity. Thanks, Dylan.

Susan Hoffinger: Let me ask you: Is that a three-way text or a two-way text? In other words, yourself and Dylan Howard, is there anybody else on that text?

Michael Cohen: Yes, Keith Davidson.

Susan Hoffinger: So, is it a text from Dylan Howard to both yourself and Keith Davidson?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Okay. Can you also read Dylan Howard's next text communication to both yourself and Keith Davidson?

Michael Cohen: So, Dylan Howard sends to both myself and Keith Davidson: Over to you two. Meaning, that the two of us should just speak independent.

Susan Hoffinger: What did you understand to be the business opportunity that Mr. Howard was referring to?

Michael Cohen: The business opportunity was the acquisition of the life rights of Stormy Daniels.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, you can take that down. Thank you. Can we now show People's Exhibit 337, and highlight the call between Mr. Cohen and Keith Davidson on October 10, 2016.

Susan Hoffinger: I believe there are two calls referenced there. Now, after Dylan Howard confirmed that Keith Davidson would be representing Stormy Daniels, did you reach out and speak with Keith Davidson by phone?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: And from this point on, did you speak a great deal with Mr. Davidson about purchasing the life rights to Stormy Daniels' story?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: You can take that down. Thank you.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, after you learned from Dylan Howard and from Keith Davidson about the Stormy Daniels story, and her wanting to publish that story, and the conversations about purchasing that story, did you speak to Mr. Trump?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: Can you tell us -- first of all, why did you speak to Mr. Trump about it?

Michael Cohen: Because it was a matter that affected him and because that was what I always did, which was, to keep him abreast of everything.

Susan Hoffinger: Was this also a serious matter at that time?

Michael Cohen: A very serious matter.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you tell him what you had heard from Dylan Howard and Keith Davidson?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And what was his reaction?

Michael Cohen: He was really angry with me: I thought you had this under control. I thought you took care of this. I expressed to Mr. Trump: We did, 2011. I have no control over what she goes out and does. And he expressed to me: There is previous denial. Just take care of it. There was a lot going on at the campaign at the time.

Michael Cohen: He was like: Just take care of it.

Susan Hoffinger: Did he say anything to you at that time about how this might be viewed if it got out?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: What did he say, in substance?

Michael Cohen: He said to me: This is a disaster, total disaster. Women are going to hate me. Because this is really a disaster, women will hate me. Guys may think it's cool, but this is going to be a disaster for the campaign.

Susan Hoffinger: What, if anything, did you understand about -- withdrawn. Why did you understand -- what did you understand him to mean by "women will hate this," and what his concern was?

Todd Blanche: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Overruled.

Michael Cohen: So, at the time Mr. Trump was polling very, very low with women and --

Susan Hoffinger: You said "very well?"

Michael Cohen: No. Very poorly. I am sorry.

Susan Hoffinger: It's all right. I couldn't hear.

Michael Cohen: He was polling very poorly with women, and this, coupled with the previous Access Hollywood tape, he just stated: This is a disaster, and get control over it.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you have any conversation with him about strategy in dealing with the story?

Michael Cohen: I am sorry?

Susan Hoffinger: Did you have any conversation, additional conversation with Mr. Trump about a particular strategy about how to get control of it and how to deal with it?

Michael Cohen: He told me to work with David and get control over this, purchase the life rights, we need to stop this from getting out.

Susan Hoffinger: Was there any conversation about pushing it to a period of time?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: What was that?

Michael Cohen: So, during the negotiation to purchase and acquire the life rights, what he had said to me is: What I want you to do is just push it out as long as you can. Just get past the election, because if I win, it has no relevance, I will be President. If I lose, I don't even care.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you bring up at the time the topic of his wife, Melania, in one of those conversations with Mr. Trump?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: What did you say, in substance, to him?

Michael Cohen: I said to him: And how's things going to go with upstairs?

Susan Hoffinger: Were you concerned about that?

Michael Cohen: I was.

Susan Hoffinger: And what, if anything, did he say to you about that?

Michael Cohen: Don't worry, he goes. He goes: How long do you think I will be on the market for? Not long.

Susan Hoffinger: What did you understand that to mean?

Michael Cohen: He wasn't thinking about Melania. This was all about the campaign.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, those conversations that you had with Mr. Trump, were they in person, on the phone, or both?

Michael Cohen: Both.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, can we put up now, please, People's 63 in evidence. Can you blow up the body of the email so that Mr. Cohen can read it.

Susan Hoffinger: Do you recognize this email, Mr. Cohen?

Michael Cohen: This is from Keith Davidson to me on October 11th.

Susan Hoffinger: What year?

Michael Cohen: 2016. And it says: Michael, please find Ms. Daniels' Settlement Agreement and Side Letter Agreement attached. I have not filled in the Side Letter Agreement (SLA) which identifies the parties to this agreement. Under the terms of the Agreement, neither my client or I are entitled to possession of the SLA.

Michael Cohen: Settlement sum is $130,000. I have also attached my firm's wiring instructions for your reference. Ms. Daniels' expressed dissatisfaction with your schedule of the delay of ten days for funding. To that end, you will see that I placed this Friday, October 14 of 2016, as the funding deadline. Let me know if this is a problem.

Michael Cohen: Let me know if you have any questions or concerns about anything. Keith.

Susan Hoffinger: Let me ask you to blow up the top of the email which shows the "tos" and "froms."

Susan Hoffinger: Did you receive this email at your Trump Organization email address?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, this email that you received, which can we scroll down, does this contain an attachment? Does this contain the Settlement Agreement and the Side Letter Agreement that was referenced?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And does this Agreement at this point contain the signatures of Ms. Daniels and Mr. Davidson, but no signatures on your side yet?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Susan Hoffinger: So, the date of this email --

Susan Hoffinger: If we can go back to the email again for a moment.

Note: [Displayed]

Susan Hoffinger: -- is October 11th, is that right, of 2016?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Is that just a few days after the release of the Access Hollywood tape?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: By October 11 of 2016, had you and Keith Davidson already agreed in principal to the terms of this Agreement?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And you had some discussions about how much would need to be paid to Stormy Daniels for this Agreement by that date, had you arranged a number?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: And tell us, just in general, the terms of that Agreement on this date?

Michael Cohen: For the sum of $130,000, that Ms. Daniels would execute a Non-disclosure Agreement, that the life rights story would never come out, that she wouldn't speak of it. And --

Susan Hoffinger: Was there a breach provision, an amount, a liquid amount?

Michael Cohen: Yes. There was a very large 1-million-dollar per violation liquid punitive damages. It was a clause that we put in where she would owe at that point in time the LLC that was going to do it, she would owe them 1-million-dollars per violation.

Susan Hoffinger: Whose idea was it to have that million-dollar, as you say, punitive damage provision in the contract?

Michael Cohen: It was mine.

Susan Hoffinger: What was the point of that?

Michael Cohen: To ensure that she didn't speak. Not only that, there was also a provision in there that she disclose who she had told the story to, and they were included in the Agreement.

Susan Hoffinger: There was a list of names that were included in the Agreement?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, the email mentions a Side Letter Agreement. That is also one of the attachments here. What was the purpose of the Side Letter Agreement that is referenced here?

Michael Cohen: The Side Letter Agreement would be a one-page document that indicates pseudonym names that we were going to use in the Non-Disclosure Agreement. And the purpose of that is if somehow the Non-Disclosure Agreement got out, having the names Peggy Peterson or David Dennison would have no meaning to anyone.

Susan Hoffinger: And so, would the Side Letter Agreement be a key to who those names are really related to?

Michael Cohen: Yes. I was the only one that would have that one page.

Susan Hoffinger: And explain why you were the only one that was going to hold onto that Side Letter Agreement which indicated the true names of the people involved in the Agreement?

Michael Cohen: In that way, I was the only one, there is no way for it to be released, and the information would never get out.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, you said that, I think by this date, neither you, obviously, or Mr. Trump, had signed this agreement by that date?

Michael Cohen: No, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Why hadn't you signed it at that point?

Michael Cohen: Because during my conversations with Mr. Trump, it was again about delaying the deal and trying to push it past the election which was upcoming.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, in the email, Mr. Davidson says that Ms. Daniels had expressed some dissatisfaction with your schedule delay of ten days for funding. What was he referring to about your schedule of delay of ten days for funding?

Michael Cohen: Well, he wanted an immediate wire transfer, and I expressed to him I would need ten days in order to fund the transaction. I would have waited to the tenth day and do it again, which is what I was instructed to do, push it past the election date.

Susan Hoffinger: So, you could have funded it earlier, but you tried to push it off with the additional ten days, is that right?

Michael Cohen: I was following directions.

Susan Hoffinger: So, at this point, he is asking for a funding deadline of October 14th, is that correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And were you intending at that point to make that deadline of October 14th?

Michael Cohen: No, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: What were you going to try to do?

Michael Cohen: Delay it.

Susan Hoffinger: Your Honor, do you want me to continue?

Juan Merchan: Is this is a good time to break?

Susan Hoffinger: It's up to you. It's perfectly fine.

Juan Merchan: Jurors, I will remind you of all of my instructions, including that you not discuss this case either among yourselves or with anyone else.

Michael Cohen: Please continue to keep an open mind as to the defendant's guilt or innocence. Please do not form or express an opinion as to defendant's guilt or innocence. I will see you at 2 o'clock. Enjoy your lunch.

Juan Merchan: You may be seated. Sir, you can step down.

Juan Merchan: Is there anything that we need to go over?

Susan Hoffinger: No, your Honor.

Todd Blanche: No.

Juan Merchan: Okay. I will see you at 2.

Note: [Afternoon Session.]

Juan Merchan: Good afternoon. Can we get the witness, Mr. Cohen.

Juan Merchan: Get the jury, please.

Juan Merchan: Please be seated.

Court Clerk: Case on trial continued. All jurors are present an properly seated. Ms. Hoffinger.

Susan Hoffinger: Thank you.

Note: [Continued direct examination by Susan Hoffinger.]

Susan Hoffinger: Good afternoon, Mr. Cohen.

Michael Cohen: Good afternoon.

Susan Hoffinger: When we left off, we were talking a little bit about the funding deadline for the payoff of the Stormy Daniels' NDA. Do you remember that?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Susan Hoffinger: Let's put up now for everybody what is in evidence as People's Exhibit 64.

Note: [Displayed].

Susan Hoffinger: Do you recognize these emails with Keith Davidson?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Susan Hoffinger: Were they sent -- received and sent from your Trump Organization email address?

Michael Cohen: This is from Keith Davidson to me, dated October 12, 2016.

Susan Hoffinger: Can you read the emails for the jury, please?

Michael Cohen: Yes. Not necessary to speak today. You should have all the executed documents a few days ago. Talk to you tomorrow.

Susan Hoffinger: Is there another email below that?

Michael Cohen: Yes. This is my response to Keith Davidson: Yes. It's Yom Kippur so the office is for all purposes closed. I'm in today, but can speak for the next three hours via cell if necessary.

Susan Hoffinger: Just to orient the jury, was that the first email, the one at the bottom, and the response by Keith Davidson at the top?

Michael Cohen: Yes. Then it is followed by Keith Davidson to me: We good.

Susan Hoffinger: So, what was happening at this time?

Michael Cohen: Continue to delay. Delay the execution of the documents. Continue the delay of execution of funding. In this specific case, I used the holiday of Yom Kippur as a way of just, once again, trying to delay it, which is until after the election.

Susan Hoffinger: And the reason for that?

Michael Cohen: Because after the election it wouldn't matter.

Susan Hoffinger: And according to who?

Michael Cohen: According to Mr. Trump.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, around this time, the middle of October or so, did you have some more conversations with Mr. Trump about Keith Davidson pushing for payment around this time?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And what was his response?

Michael Cohen: I mean, I'm incredibly busy right now. There is a lot going on. I am travelling all over. I don't have time to think about this right now. Just give me a few days.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you have those conversations with him sometimes by telephone and sometimes in person?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: When you called him, did you sometimes use your cell, sometimes use your landline phone at The Trump Organization?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: You said he was travelling a lot. Was this the time when he was campaigning for the presidency?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And in terms of his schedule during October, how did he travel in terms of for the campaign?

Michael Cohen: With his own private plane.

Susan Hoffinger: Was he still sometimes in the office during that time, even when he was campaigning?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: During what time -- did you sometimes see him in the office during those times?

Michael Cohen: Sometimes.

Susan Hoffinger: Do you recall, was it at various times that he might be back in the office?

Michael Cohen: Yes. It depended upon the schedule of the rallies that were taking place all around the country.

Susan Hoffinger: So, is it fair, you spoke to him in person when you were able to see him, if not, you spoke to him by telephone?

Michael Cohen: When possible.

Susan Hoffinger: Let's show People's 363 in evidence.

Susan Hoffinger: And can you tell us what this email is and between who and who?

Michael Cohen: This is an email from me to Gary Farro, asking him to call me.

Susan Hoffinger: Who is Gary Farro?

Michael Cohen: Gary Farro was my account representative at First Republic Bank.

Susan Hoffinger: And can we scroll down and see if there is an attachment on this email. I think there may be a couple of pages. Scroll down.

Susan Hoffinger: What, if anything, did you send, according to this exhibit? What did you send him?

Michael Cohen: I sent him the corporate documents for Resolution Consultants LLC to open a bank account.

Susan Hoffinger: And now, can we go back to the email, please. And can you go to the top email, which is Gary Farro's email to someone else at First Republic Bank.

Note: [Displayed]

Susan Hoffinger: Can you read that?

Michael Cohen: This is an email from Gary Farro, dated same date, October 13 of 2016, to Oliva Cassin, who was a banker at First Republic. It states: Need an account opened for Michael Cohen immediately. He wants no address on the checks. Call me now to discuss.

Susan Hoffinger: So, mid-October, now why are you reaching out to Gary Farro to set up an account for Resolution Consultants?

Michael Cohen: In the event of the need for an account to be opened to transfer the funds.

Susan Hoffinger: Is it what you anticipated -- what you believed might need to happen soon?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we take that down. Put up People's 364 in evidence. Can we blow up the email a little bit.

Susan Hoffinger: Can you tell us what this email is?

Michael Cohen: It's an email from Oliva Cassin, again, First Republic Bank to me, and cc'd to Gary Farro, regarding account paperwork for Resolution Consultants.

Susan Hoffinger: If we can scroll down.

Susan Hoffinger: Is she sending you something?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: What is she sending you?

Michael Cohen: An attachment of the paperwork that is needed in which to establish the bank account.

Susan Hoffinger: So, are these various pages of opening account records with information filled in for you to review?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we put up -- were you familiar with the account opening paperwork at First Republic Bank?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And had you other accounts there and set up other accounts there?

Michael Cohen: Multiple.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we now put up People's 366 in evidence.

Note: [Displayed]

Susan Hoffinger: What is this email, Mr. Cohen?

Michael Cohen: It's an email from me to Olivia regarding the paperwork.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we take a look at the attachments to that email. Maybe we can scroll down a little bit. Thank you.

Susan Hoffinger: So, what are you sending back Olivia Cassin now in the email?

Michael Cohen: The documents necessary to open up the bank account.

Susan Hoffinger: Had you signed them, according to these attachments?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: Let's take a look at a few places in this paperwork. Can we go to Page 5 of the PDF entitled "Business Information Form Overview." 1A, can we blow that up.

Susan Hoffinger: Is the description of what Resolution Consultants is here in the paperwork?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Can you read that?

Michael Cohen: It states: Please include product of services provided, typical customers, suppliers, et cetera. It says: Resolution Consultants LLC is a consulting firm. Michael Cohen provides individuals and businesses financial services, law firms, technology firms, et cetera, advice on strategy, PR marketing, best practices and procedures, et cetera.

Michael Cohen: All of his clients are in the United States of America.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we also take a look at Page 9 of the PDF.

Susan Hoffinger: That is NAICS business description?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And can you read the description there of the business.

Michael Cohen: So the NAICS code is 541611. The business description is "Management consulting, including HR and marketing."

Susan Hoffinger: Can we finally look at the NAICS. Actually, we already read that.

Susan Hoffinger: Let me ask you: Mr. Cohen, did you sign these documents at Page 3?

Susan Hoffinger: Let's show Page 3 of the PDF.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you sign that?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: On what date?

Michael Cohen: October 13, 2016.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we take a look at page of the signature block.

Note: [Displayed]

Susan Hoffinger: Did you sign it there as well?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: What is the date on there?

Michael Cohen: Same date, October 13, 2016.

Susan Hoffinger: Were the descriptions in the account paperwork that we just read, were they truthful as of the date that you opened the account?

Michael Cohen: No.

Susan Hoffinger: Why didn't you give FRB the true reason for your opening the account?

Michael Cohen: Well, I'm not sure they would have opened it if it stated to pay off -- to pay off an adult film star for a Non-Disclosure Agreement.

Susan Hoffinger: You understood that, is that right?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you ever end up finalizing the account for the bank account for Resolution Consultants LLC?

Michael Cohen: No, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: What happened?

Michael Cohen: I realized that during the process, I couldn't remember why I even called it Resolution Consultants. Then it dawned on me that it's actually the name of a company of somebody who I know who happens to be out of state. I didn't think he would appreciate if I had used the same name as his company.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you end up -- when you ultimately opened the account at FRB, did you use a different name of a different company?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: And what name was that?

Michael Cohen: I transferred it, I made it to Essential Consultants LLC.

Susan Hoffinger: You filled out similar paperwork at FRB for the Essential Consultants account?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Also with false descriptions of the purpose of the account?

Michael Cohen: The same information.

Susan Hoffinger: Thank you very much. You can take that down. Can we now put up People's 281 in evidence.

Susan Hoffinger: What is the date of this emailm and who is it from and who?

Michael Cohen: It's to me from Keith Davidson. Dated Monday, October 17, 2016. And the subject is: PP, which is for Peggy Peterson, versus DD, David Dennison, slash, important.

Susan Hoffinger: Can you read the email?

Michael Cohen: It states: Michael, I have been charged by my client with forwarding the below message. We have a written Settlement Agreement which calls for settlement payment to be sent by the end of business this past Friday, October 14th, 2016. No payment was received. We spoke on Friday, October 14th, and you stated that funds would be wired today, October 17, 2016. No funds have been received as of the sending of this email.

Michael Cohen: My client informs me that she intends to cancel the settlement contract if no funds are received by 5 PST today. Please call me if you have any questions. Keith.

Susan Hoffinger: What was happening at this time with respect to the deal?

Michael Cohen: My intent was to continue to delay it as per Mr. Trump's demand, and I clearly did not send funds to Mr. Davidson at this IOLA lawyer's account on this date.

Susan Hoffinger: On this date?

Michael Cohen: On this date.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we take that down and put up People's 282 in evidence. If we can blow it up a little bit.

Susan Hoffinger: Can you tell us who this email is from and to and the date?

Michael Cohen: This is from Keith Davidson to me. Same date of October 17, 2016, 1:31 p.m. Regarding same matter: PP versus DD. Important. And it states: Please be advised that my client deems her Settlement Agreement cancelled and void Ab initio. Please further be advised that I no longer represent her in this or any matter.

Susan Hoffinger: What did you understand was happening now in terms of this email?

Michael Cohen: We were losing control over the settlement of this Agreement in order to prevent the story from coming out. That as a direct result of my failure to wire funds, that Keith Davidson was no longer going to be acting as Stormy Daniels' counsel in this matter.

Susan Hoffinger: And were you concerned?

Michael Cohen: Very much so.

Susan Hoffinger: Thank you.

Susan Hoffinger: You can take that down. Please put up People's 177A in evidence.

Susan Hoffinger: Focus on from the texts from Dylan Howard on October 17, 2016, Page 3.

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Can you read to the jury this text? This is the text you received from Dylan Howard on that same date, October 17, 2016?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Can you read that?

Michael Cohen: It's from Dylan Howard to me. It states: I'm told they're going with Daily Mail. Are you aware?

Susan Hoffinger: What did you understand the "they" were in this email?

Michael Cohen: Stormy Daniels.

Susan Hoffinger: And can we blow up the next text communication after this.

Susan Hoffinger: Can you read for the jury the rest of the text communications on October 17, 2016?

Michael Cohen: From me to Dylan Howard: Call me. Then I responded back with three question marks because I hadn't heard back. This was obviously incredibly stressful and incredibly important. I finally receive a response back from Dylan Howard: "Not taking my calls." And he was referencing there Keith Davidson. "He's not talking my calls." The goal is to figure out exactly what was going on and what else could be done.

Michael Cohen: I then respond from me to Dylan: You're kidding. Then I continue by saying: Who are you trying to reach? I wanted just to confirm that my suspicion that he was trying to reach Keith Davidson and not maybe somebody else. To which he responds thereafter: The agent. "The agent" I knew to be Keith Davidson.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, did you also speak by telephone that day with Dylan Howard?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: And why did you speak with him by telephone?

Michael Cohen: This was of grave importance.

Susan Hoffinger: What, if anything, did you understand at this point about whether Stormy Daniels might end up in the Daily Mail?

Michael Cohen: That's what we were told, and that's what I relayed to Mr. Trump.

Susan Hoffinger: And so, let's put up now People's 349 in evidence. And let's blow up the call on October 17, 2016 at 5 p.m. between Michael Cohen and Mr. Trump.

Susan Hoffinger: Do you see a call there?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Susan Hoffinger: Who called who?

Michael Cohen: I called Mr. Trump.

Susan Hoffinger: And why did you call him?

Michael Cohen: In order to advise him of this situation, that because I didn't forward the funds, she's now declared the Agreement void and that we were not going to be in a position to delay it post the election, which is what he wanted me to do, and that the matter was going to -- the story was going to go to the Daily Mail.

Susan Hoffinger: That was your intention in making the call?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Do you notice it's just about eight seconds on that call? What do you think happened with that call?

Michael Cohen: I received a voicemail.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you receive a voicemail?

Michael Cohen: I spoke to the voicemail.

Susan Hoffinger: So, you left a voicemail?

Michael Cohen: I left a voicemail.

Susan Hoffinger: For Mr. Trump. Okay. Did you believe at this time you could continue to delay the transaction?

Michael Cohen: No.

Susan Hoffinger: We can take that down. Thank you. Let's show, please, People's 369 in evidence.

Susan Hoffinger: Do you recognize that, Mr. Cohen?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Susan Hoffinger: What is it?

Michael Cohen: This is a filing receipt for the State of Delaware in the formation of Essential Consultants LLC.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you set up the Essential Consultants LLC on that date, October 17th?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: Why did you go ahead and do it on that date?

Michael Cohen: Because I wanted to make sure that, again, I had a vehicle within which to transfer funds to Keith Davidson to lock down the story.

Susan Hoffinger: Thank you very much. Can you take that down. Can we now put up People's 216 for identification. Can you take it down. Just to the witness, the Court and the parties.

Susan Hoffinger: So, it's 216 for identification. Do you recognize what is on the screen?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Susan Hoffinger: What is it?

Michael Cohen: This is from Patty over at Delaney Corp. That's the company that incorporates on October 24, 2016. It's an invoice stating: Here is the invoice to cancel the old LLC and file the new LLC. Meaning, I was closing out Resolution and incorporating Essential Consultants.

Susan Hoffinger: On what date did you close out Resolution and open up Essential Consultants?

Michael Cohen: I believe it was that day.

Susan Hoffinger: Which date was that?

Michael Cohen: The 24th.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we take a look?

Michael Cohen: I think it was the 17th.

Susan Hoffinger: I offer that in evidence, People's 216.

Todd Blanche: No objection.

Juan Merchan: Received into evidence.

Note: [Whereupon, People's Exhibit 216 was received into evidence.]

Susan Hoffinger: Can we look at Page 2 of the invoice.

Susan Hoffinger: Does the email show the date you cancelled Resolution Consultants?

Michael Cohen: The 17th of October, 2016.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we now put up People's 249 in evidence and blow it up a little bit.

Susan Hoffinger: You mentioned on October 17th you left a voicemail for Mr. Trump, do you recall that?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Do you recognize what this record is?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: What is it?

Michael Cohen: This is a text message on October 18, 2016, from Melania to me.

Susan Hoffinger: Can you read what it says?

Michael Cohen: Good morning, Michael. Can you please call DT on his cell. Thanks. And "DT," of course, references Donald Trump.

Susan Hoffinger: What time was that text?

Michael Cohen: That text is at 8:53 a.m.

Susan Hoffinger: Do you respond by text?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Susan Hoffinger: What is your response?

Michael Cohen: "Of course."

Susan Hoffinger: What time is that response?

Michael Cohen: 8:54.

Susan Hoffinger: Do you believe that you spoke to Mr. Trump after Mrs. Trump asked you to reach out to him and call him?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Is that dated October 18, 2016?

Michael Cohen: It is.

Susan Hoffinger: Was that a workday, do you know?

Michael Cohen: I believe it is.

Susan Hoffinger: And were you usually at work by that time, 8:53 a.m. in the morning?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Do you believe that you called Mr. Trump using your landline at The Trump Organization?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, I would -- so, we're now talking about October 18, 2016, and I would like to ask you: On that day, or that evening, did you make an appearance on Wolf Blitzer's show on CNN that night?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: Why did you do that?

Michael Cohen: In order to respond to a series of topics that affected Mr. Trump and the campaign.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you tell Mr. Trump that you were going on CNN?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And were you going on as a support to the campaign, to try to talk about his priorities?

Michael Cohen: Yes, as a surrogate.

Susan Hoffinger: And you said that was to deflect from some other news that was out there?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Susan Hoffinger: And without providing us with any details or elaborating, were you asked by Wolf Blitzer to respond a number of times to questions about reports of Mr. Trump's behavior with women?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you steer the conversation as best you could towards his presidential policies?

Todd Blanche: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Susan Hoffinger: What, if anything, did you do during that interview?

Michael Cohen: I advocated for Mr. Trump in the best light possible, denials, as well as exclamations, that I have never seem him act in this sort of manner before. I was doing everything that I could within which to change the direction of the comments.

Susan Hoffinger: And you had some talking points for the campaign, talking points about Mr. Trump's priorities to deliver on that show?

Michael Cohen: I received regular talking points from the campaign.

Susan Hoffinger: Do you believe you received some that night as well?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you try to emphasize those talking points as well?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: What, if any, additional pressure did you feel to close this deal with Stormy Daniels as a result?

Michael Cohen: Well, because the Daily Mail was in play and they were anxious to sell the story.

Susan Hoffinger: Did there come a time after that, again, still in October of 2016, that Mr. Trump, in substance, expressed to you that he understood he could no longer delay this transaction?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And describe that conversation that you had with him?

Michael Cohen: He stated to me that he had spoken to some friends, some individuals, very smart people, and that: It's $130,000. You're like a billionaire. Just pay it. There is no reason to keep this thing out there. So do it. And he expressed to me: Just do it. Go meet up with Allen Weisselberg and figure this whole thing out.

Susan Hoffinger: Following that conversation with Mr. Trump, did you, in fact, have some discussions with Allen Weisselberg about trying to figure out how the payment would be made?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And what, in substance, did you discuss with Weisselberg and the different options?

Michael Cohen: Well, that I had the opening of the company all set up. Now it just needed to be funded. To which Weisselberg turned and said: Can we get AMI to pay it? I said: No. They've already expressed to me they're not paying it. They said we need to come up with a way how to fund it. I said: We need to do it immediately.

Susan Hoffinger: What options did Mr. Weisselberg discuss with you?

Michael Cohen: One option was to see whether I knew anybody who wanted to purchase a golf membership at one of the various golf courses or possibly somebody who was having a family affair, like a wedding or Bar Mitzvah, that would be interested in paying the money there and taking it as credit off of their invoice, or maybe even just running it through one of the golf courses.

Susan Hoffinger: Was he suggesting it would be a vehicle to use that money to pay this?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And what, if anything, did you discuss about those options?

Michael Cohen: Obviously, that wasn't a possibility because each of those entities has a Trump name attached to it, and the whole purpose was to ensure that Trump name in no way was disclosed in this Non-Disclosure Agreement.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you suggest to Mr. Weisselberg about him funding it?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Todd Blanche: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Overruled.

Michael Cohen: I stated to Allen: You're the CFO. You're making seven figures. Why don't you pay it. You'll get paid back. You don't have to worry about that one.

Susan Hoffinger: What did he say?

Michael Cohen: He said to me he wasn't financially in a position to do it. He stated: Michael, as you know, I have my four grandkids at prep school, and that I have summer camps for them that I am paying for, I just can't do it.

Susan Hoffinger: What did you resolve between the two of you, yourself and Weisselberg, ultimately?

Michael Cohen: Well, because of the urgency that was happening and the fact she was heading -- or at least they expressed to me they were heading to the Daily Mail, I ultimately said: Okay, I'll pay it.

Susan Hoffinger: Was there any discussion at that time with Mr. Weisselberg about you getting paid back eventually?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: What was discussed?

Michael Cohen: Don't worry about it, I will make sure you get paid back.

Susan Hoffinger: At some point, did you have a conversation with Mr. Trump about the fact that you were willing to pay for it, at least initially?

Michael Cohen: Yes. Allen and I spoke to Mr. Trump. We expressed to him that I was going to front the money for it. To which he was appreciative and: Good, good.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you have a sense from Mr. Trump that you would end up being out the money or you would get paid back?

Michael Cohen: He stated about it: Don't worry about it. You will get the money back.

Susan Hoffinger: Would you have ever paid for the NDA for Stormy Daniels on your own without an understanding that you would get paid back?

Michael Cohen: No.

Susan Hoffinger: Why not?

Michael Cohen: It's $130,000. I was doing everything that I could and more in order to protect my boss, which was something I had done for a long time. But I would not lay out $130,000 for an NDA needed by somebody else.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we bring up now People's Exhibit 342. Let's show those to the jury.

Susan Hoffinger: Do you recognize these? What are these, Mr. Cohen?

Michael Cohen: These are phone calls made from my cell phone to Allen Weisselberg.

Susan Hoffinger: Are these calls between July of 2015 to February of 2018?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you have Weisselberg's cell phone and work numbers in your contacts as well?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Approximately, how many calls are there during this time period with Weisselberg?

Michael Cohen: Six, in total.

Susan Hoffinger: And was it common for you to speak with Weisselberg outside the office, meaning, by phone at other times?

Michael Cohen: It wasn't common.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, let take a look at a call. We'll show the call on October 23rd of 2016, at 4:52 p.m.

Susan Hoffinger: Do you see that call?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: What does that reflect?

Michael Cohen: A voicemail.

Susan Hoffinger: Left by who?

Michael Cohen: From Allen Weisselberg to me.

Susan Hoffinger: Do you know whether that was a Sunday, October 23rd?

Michael Cohen: Not off the top of my head, no.

Susan Hoffinger: Was it unusual at 5:42 -- withdrawn. Was there, at this time, October 23rd, a reason that you understood that he was calling and leaving you a voicemail?

Michael Cohen: Regarding the funding and regarding how this was going to get done to fund the Non-Disclosure Agreement.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you -- withdrawn. Did you speak with Mr. Weisselberg over the next couple of days in the office as well?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: About finalizing these details?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And can we also take a look at the call on October 25th on this sheet.

Susan Hoffinger: Do you see another call there?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Susan Hoffinger: What time is that call?

Michael Cohen: That call is at 7:23 p.m.

Susan Hoffinger: Is that generally after work for yourself and Mr. Weisselberg?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Was it unusual to speak with Weisselberg after hours by cell phone?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Do you have a sense of why you were doing that?

Michael Cohen: It had to do with the Stormy Daniels matter.

Susan Hoffinger: Was there some urgency at this point?

Michael Cohen: Significant urgency.

Susan Hoffinger: Thank you. Can we take a look at now People's 341 in evidence, please.

Susan Hoffinger: Let's take a look at the call between Mr. Schiller and Mr. Cohen on October 24, at 8:02 p.m. Do you see that call?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: And was it 8:02 p.m.?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: You called Mr. Schiller, or did he call you?

Michael Cohen: I called Mr. Schiller.

Susan Hoffinger: Do you know why you were reaching out to Mr. Schiller in the evening of October 24, 2016?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Why?

Michael Cohen: Because I needed to speak to Mr. Trump, and I knew that Keith, Keith Schiller was with him.

Susan Hoffinger: Why did you need to speak with Mr. Trump at that point in the evening of October 24th?

Michael Cohen: To discuss the Stormy Daniels matter and the resolution of it.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you have an understanding about whether during that conversation you resolved that, you were moving forward to fund the deal?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, what was the plan for how you were going to fund the Essential Consultants account in order to transfer the money to Keith Davidson?

Michael Cohen: So, I had already, for several months at First Republic Bank, before all of this, I had a HELOC, a Home Equity Line of Credit, on my apartment. That account was paperless. Meaning, that we wouldn't receive any documents in the mail. And I elected to use money that was in the HELOC because my wife was the CEO of the household and would not understand if there was $130,000 missing from our joint bank account.

Michael Cohen: She would ask me, and I clearly could not tell her, and that would have been a problem for me. So I elected to use the HELOC. And once I received the money back from Mr. Trump, I would just deposit it and no one would be the wiser.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we now put up People's 177A in evidence.

Susan Hoffinger: And cull out the text between Mr. Howard and Mr. Cohen on October 25, 2016.

Michael Cohen: So, this is a text message from Dylan Howard to me. And it states: Keith calling you urgently. We have to coordinate something on the matter he's calling you about, or it could look awfully bad for everyone.

Susan Hoffinger: What did you understand that to mean?

Michael Cohen: This matter -- if the matter wasn't resolved, it was going to be catastrophic to Mr. Trump and the campaign.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you also have a call on that night, October 25, 2016 -- withdrawn. Did you have a call on October 25, 2016 with Dylan Howard and David Pecker?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Can you describe for the jury that call and what occurred and what was said?

Michael Cohen: Well, it was all about, again, the resolution of the Non-Disclosure Agreement.

Susan Hoffinger: And what, if anything, was Dylan Howard telling you on that phone call?

Michael Cohen: How to get this thing done. She's going to the Daily Mail. This could be catastrophic to the campaign. This will further isolate women from the candidate.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you make a request at that time of Mr. Pecker on that call?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: What did you ask him?

Michael Cohen: If he would be kind enough to make the payment.

Susan Hoffinger: Why did you ask him to make the payment at that point?

Michael Cohen: To see if he would do it, considering he's been doing it for Mr. Trump before. I figured why not ask.

Susan Hoffinger: What did he say?

Michael Cohen: Not a chance.

Susan Hoffinger: Did he say why?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: What did he say?

Michael Cohen: I knew he didn't get the money back on the $150,000 even though they turned out. I cannot do it again. It can cost me my job.

Susan Hoffinger: How did you leave things with Dylan Howard and David Pecker on that call, what did you tell them?

Michael Cohen: Make sure it's locked down. We're going to take care of it.

Susan Hoffinger: In other words, who did you say was going to take care of it at that point?

Michael Cohen: I was.

Susan Hoffinger: Thank you. Now, you said earlier, I believe, that you sometimes communicated with David Pecker by Signal, an encrypted application?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Let's put up just for the witness and counsel and the Judge People's 212 for identification, please.

Susan Hoffinger: Do you recognize that document, Mr. Cohen?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Susan Hoffinger: What is it?

Michael Cohen: This is text messages on the encrypted app of Signal.

Susan Hoffinger: And are these screenshots of the messages and reflected other communications using the Signal Application between yourself and Mr. Pecker?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Aside from what might be some redactions on that document, is this an exact copy of those communications between yourself and Mr. Pecker?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: I offer People's 212 in evidence, your Honor.

Todd Blanche: No objection.

Juan Merchan: Received into evidence.

Note: [Whereupon, People's Exhibit 212 was received into evidence.]

Susan Hoffinger: Can we focus on the call reflected here on October 25, 2016.

Susan Hoffinger: Mr. Cohen, do you see a flurry of calls on October 25, 2016, between yourself and David Pecker?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Susan Hoffinger: You had called him on that date, is that right?

Michael Cohen: That is correct.

Susan Hoffinger: Is there a reason that it shows so many on this screenshot?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: What was the reason?

Michael Cohen: Signal is terrible with keeping phone calls, they drop them all the time. We were constantly calling back and forth.

Susan Hoffinger: Were there also some calls on October 26th reflected here using the Signal App between yourself and Mr. Pecker?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Generally, what were these calls about on October 25th and October 26th with Mr. Pecker?

Michael Cohen: The Stormy Daniels matter, the resolution of it.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we please show People's 337 in evidence. And can we show the calls occurring between Mr. Cohen and Mr. Davidson on October 25, 2016. Can we highlight all the calls on that date.

Susan Hoffinger: Mr. Cohen, there are a number of calls back and forth between yourself and Keith Davidson on October 25th?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Why were there so many calls with Keith Davidson?

Michael Cohen: In order to ensure that he knew that the matter was being taken care of, and that soon there was going to be the transfer of funds, in order to have him execute the Non-Disclosure Agreement and the Side Letter.

Susan Hoffinger: What was your goal in having those communications with Keith Davidson?

Michael Cohen: In order to ensure that that occurred, so I could express to Mr. Trump as an update that this matter is under control.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you in any of these conversations mention to Keith Davidson that maybe AMI would still do the payoff instead of on your side?

Michael Cohen: I might have.

Susan Hoffinger: Why was that?

Michael Cohen: I was hoping that AMI was going to make the payment.

Susan Hoffinger: But, at the end of the day, you knew they were not, is that correct?

Michael Cohen: That is correct.

Susan Hoffinger: You may take that down. Can you now put up People's 342 in evidence. The calls, again, between Mr. Cohen and Weisselberg.

Susan Hoffinger: Can you cull out the call on October 25, 2016, at 7:23 p.m.?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am. October 25, 2016, at 7:23 p.m., I made a phone call to Allen Weisselberg.

Susan Hoffinger: And how long was the phone call, approximately?

Michael Cohen: Three minutes, 24 seconds.

Susan Hoffinger: That was in the evening?

Michael Cohen: It's in the evening.

Susan Hoffinger: After hours, after work hours?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Again, was it unusual for you to call Mr. Weisselberg after work hours?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Why did you have this call with him?

Michael Cohen: In order to discuss the finalization of the funding and just some particulars regarding funding for the execution of the Non-Disclosure Agreement.

Susan Hoffinger: I will take that down.

Susan Hoffinger: On the morning of October 26, 2016, did you set up an account for Essential Consultants at First Republic Bank?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: And what did you do?

Michael Cohen: I went across the street, which is where it was located, and I told them I need to do a transfer.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, before you went across the street to set up that account, did you speak to Mr. Trump?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we take a look at People's 349 in evidence, please. Can we highlight the two telephone calls on October 26, 2016, one at 8:30 a.m. -- two calls at about the same time, actually, about 8:30 a.m.

Note: [Displayed]

Susan Hoffinger: You see those two calls?

Michael Cohen: Yes, I do.

Susan Hoffinger: How long was the call for?

Michael Cohen: One is 3 minutes and 20 seconds. The second one is for 1 minute and 28 seconds.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you call Mr. Trump before you went and set up the account to make a transfer?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: What, in substance, did you discuss with him on these two calls?

Michael Cohen: I wanted to ensure that, once again, he approved what I was doing because I required approval from him on all of this. That's what the sum and substance of the conversation was, laying out exactly what was going to happen, what was being done in order to ensure the story didn't get sold to Daily Mail or somebody else.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you let him know you were going across the street and you were going to get the account set up and make the payment?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Would you have made that payment to Stormy Daniels without getting a signoff from Mr. Trump?

Michael Cohen: No.

Susan Hoffinger: Why not?

Michael Cohen: Because everything required Mr. Trump's signoff. On top of that, I wanted the money back.

Susan Hoffinger: Thank you. Can you take that down. Now, can you show People's Exhibit 256, please, in evidence.

Susan Hoffinger: Do you see some either emails or text messages here?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Susan Hoffinger: Who are these communications with on October 26th?

Michael Cohen: These are communications between myself and Delaney Corp., going back to Patty.

Susan Hoffinger: Can you take a look at the texts on that date. Actually, withdrawn. You said that you called Mr. Trump at about 8:30 a.m. on October 26th, do you recall that?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: At approximately 9:04 a.m., is that when you reached out to Patty at Delaney Corp. to get documentation needed?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Why did you email her? I believe it's an email at that time?

Michael Cohen: Because I needed to get certain documentation in order to open up the account at First Republic Bank.

Susan Hoffinger: What sort of documentation did you need? I think it's in the email.

Michael Cohen: Final receipt.

Susan Hoffinger: For Essential Consultants?

Michael Cohen: For Essential Consultants.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you have an understanding you would need that for the bank to get it set up?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Thank you. Was there some urgency with Patty at Delaney Corp. to get it right away?

Michael Cohen: It was time sensitive, so I was doing my best within which to impress upon her that I needed it ASAP.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we take a look at now People's 368 in evidence.

Susan Hoffinger: Do you recognize this "Know Your Customer Form?"

Michael Cohen: I do.

Susan Hoffinger: Do you know, when you open up accounts with banks, that they fill out "Know Your Customer" information so they know the need for the account? Are you familiar with that?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, did you meet with a representative of First Republic Bank to give them some further information for the KYC form?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And -- withdrawn.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we take a look at Page 2 of 4 of that PDF. Blow up there the description of "Business Narrative."

Susan Hoffinger: And if could you read that to the jury, Mr. Cohen?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am. It states: Michael Cohen is opening Essential Consultants LLC as a real estate consulting company to collect fees for investment -- it should say consultation work -- he does for real estate deals. It is dated October 26, 2016.

Susan Hoffinger: And was that business narrative description on the KYC form true or false?

Michael Cohen: It's false.

Susan Hoffinger: Why didn't you give them the true reason of setting up that account?

Michael Cohen: To hide the intent of the reason for opening Essential Consultants, which is to pay for a Non-Disclosure Agreement.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you have an understanding as to whether the bank may or may not open such an account if you had given them a true reason?

Michael Cohen: I believe they probably would not.

Susan Hoffinger: Thank you. Can you take that down.

Susan Hoffinger: Take a look at People's 371 in evidence. Do you recognize the documents that are contained in People's 371?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Susan Hoffinger: What kind of documents are these?

Michael Cohen: This is a document to open up the account as well as a signature card.

Susan Hoffinger: And if you can scroll down a little bit.

Susan Hoffinger: Are there also some certificates attached, first of all?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: What is attached here?

Michael Cohen: This is the filing receipt for Essential Consultants.

Susan Hoffinger: This was required for you to set up the account?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we take a look at Page 3 here in terms of the type of business that's on this form.

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: What does it say?

Michael Cohen: Consulting.

Susan Hoffinger: And, again, was that a true description of your intent to open up that account?

Michael Cohen: No, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: And for the same reasons that you said earlier?

Michael Cohen: For the same reason.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we take a look at the signature pages on Pages 4 and 5 of the PDF.

Susan Hoffinger: I am just asking you: Did you sign that form?

Michael Cohen: That is my signature. Dated, October 26, 2016.

Susan Hoffinger: Thank you. You can take that down.

Susan Hoffinger: By the way, did you identify Mr. Trump on that opening account document as being involved with that Essential Consultants account at Federal Republic Bank?

Michael Cohen: No, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Why not?

Michael Cohen: Because, again, it was to protect him and isolate him from the transaction.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we now put up People's 372 in evidence. And can you read this.

Susan Hoffinger: First of all, who is this email from and who is it to?

Michael Cohen: This is an email from Elizabeth Rapaport, another employee of First Republic Bank, on October 26, 2016, to me. Subject: First Republic Bank transfer. The importance: Hi. Good afternoon, Mr. Cohen. Per our conversation over the phone, please confirm your request to transfer $131,000 from your HELOC account number ending in 6194 to your checking account ending in 1897.

Susan Hoffinger: And your response?

Susan Hoffinger: If we can show Mr. Cohen's response.

Michael Cohen: "Confirmed."

Susan Hoffinger: Is this consistent with the plan that you discussed about how you were going to fund this account to make a payment?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And was this email sent to you at your Trump Organization email?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: What does your signature block say on that email?

Michael Cohen: Executive Vice-President, Special Counsel to Donald J. Trump.

Susan Hoffinger: Thank you. You can take that down. Can we now take a look at People's Exhibit 284 in evidence. If we can blow up the email a little bit.

Susan Hoffinger: Do you recognize this email, Mr. Cohen?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Susan Hoffinger: What is this email?

Michael Cohen: This is an email from Elizabeth Rapaport to me. Dated Wednesday, October 26, 2016, at 4:15 p.m., regarding First Republic's Bank transfer. Good afternoon, Mr. Cohen. The funds have been deposited into your checking account ending in 1897. Best, Lizzie.

Susan Hoffinger: What do you do with that email, do you forward that?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: Who did you forward it to?

Michael Cohen: Keith Davidson.

Susan Hoffinger: And why did you forward it to Keith Davidson?

Michael Cohen: In order to demonstrate to him that the deal is going to be consummated, that we're moving forward with it. To make sure everything stays locked down, that Ms. Daniels is under control.

Susan Hoffinger: Thank you. You can take that down. Can we now put up People's Exhibit 168 in evidence.

Susan Hoffinger: Who is this an email from and who is this to?

Michael Cohen: This is an email from Dylan Howard, dated Wednesday, October 26, 2016, at 8:23 p.m. Subject is: Confirmation. It's to me and to Keith Davidson.

Susan Hoffinger: What does it read?

Michael Cohen: Michael, Keith: Thank you both for chatting with me earlier. Confirming Agreement on it. States: Executed Agreement hand signed by Keith's client and returned via overnight or same day FedEx to Michael. Next point was: Change of Agreement to reflect the correct LLC. because I had previously given him the name Resolution Consultants LLC.

Michael Cohen: And the third part was: Transfer of funds on Thursday a.m. to be held in escrow until receipt of Agreement. Thank you both. Dylan.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you have an understanding why Dylan Howard was sending you and Keith Davidson this email?

Michael Cohen: Just outlining everything that had happened. They, too, had been very active in terms of helping to secure and lock down the Agreement. Not to mention David wanted to ensure that Mr. Trump knew how much time and work that they had invested into making this happen for his benefit.

Susan Hoffinger: But, just to focus, this is Dylan Howard on this making sure, is it not, that the transaction --

Michael Cohen: Yes. And Dylan Howard, of course, works for David Pecker.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we take that down now and put up People's 366 in evidence. And can we blow up the top of this a little bit so we can see what it is.

Note: [Displayed]

Susan Hoffinger: Do you recognize this document?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Susan Hoffinger: What is it?

Michael Cohen: This is a wire transfer document.

Susan Hoffinger: Is it an authorization?

Michael Cohen: It is.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we scroll down just a little bit to your signature.

Susan Hoffinger: Is this an authorization signed by you, a First Republic Bank document, authorizing the transfer of money?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: What is the date on this authorization form?

Michael Cohen: October 27, 2016.

Susan Hoffinger: And so, the next day, on October 27, 2016, did you wire $130,000 payment to Keith Davidson?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: And is Mr. Davidson listed as the beneficiary of wire on this form?

Michael Cohen: Actually, his Attorney-Client Trust Account is.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we blow up the description of the purpose of the wire on this form.

Susan Hoffinger: What does that say is the purpose of the wire?

Michael Cohen: It states "retainer."

Susan Hoffinger: And was that truthful or was there a retainer?

Michael Cohen: No, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: What was the true purpose of this wire transfer that was made to Mr. Davidson's account?

Michael Cohen: In order to pay Stormy Daniels to execute the Non-Disclosure Agreement and to obtain her story, her life rights.

Susan Hoffinger: So, this was not truthful, is that right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Susan Hoffinger: That's for the same reasons that you stated earlier?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Thank you. You can take that down. Can you now, please, put up People's Exhibit 285 in evidence. Blow that up just a little bit.

Note: [Displayed]

Susan Hoffinger: Can you tell the jury what this email is, from who to who, and what it is?

Michael Cohen: Yes. It's to me, from Keith Davidson. Dated, Thursday, October 27, 2016. With the subject line: Wire on behalf of Essential Consultants LLC. It states: I confirm that I will work in good faith and that no funds shall be disbursed unless and until the Plaintiff personally signs all necessary settlement paperwork.

Michael Cohen: The form of which will match the prior Agreement. The settlement documents will name the correct corporation, Essential Consultants LLC. Plaintiff's signature will be Notarized and returned to you via FedEx. Only after you receive the FedEx, will I disburse. Fair?

Note: [Whereupon, Theresa Magniccari, Senior Court Reporter, was relieved by Laurie Eisenberg, Senior Court Reporter.]

Susan Hoffinger: So -- and I apologize. Was that the second email in this email chain, was there a prior email?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we blow up the prior email.

Susan Hoffinger: And you can describe the prior email that preceded Mr. Davidson's response. Your email.

Michael Cohen: Sure. Prior to the receipt of Keith Davidson's response, I had sent to Keith: "Kindly confirm that the wire received today, October 27, 2016, shall be held by you in your attorney's trust account until such time as directed for release by me, in writing. Additionally, please ensure that all paperwork contains the correct name of Essential Consultants LLC.

Michael Cohen: I thank you in advance for your assistance and look forward to hearing from you later. Yours, Michael."

Susan Hoffinger: Why did you send this email to Keith Davidson?

Michael Cohen: I sent it to him to ensure that the wire was received by him, that he had properly corrected the name on the paperwork to reflect Essential Consultants LLC, and to ask him -- direct him, as an attorney through his lawyer's IOLA account, not to disburse any funds to Ms. Daniels or anyone else until such time as directed by me. I wanted to ensure that I received the executed Non-Disclosure Agreement, as promised, before they released funds.

Susan Hoffinger: At this point, you didn't yet have the signed Agreement from Ms. Daniels, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct. The signed Agreement and the Side Letter Agreement.

Susan Hoffinger: Thank you. You can take that down.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, after you wired that money to Keith Davidson, did you then receive the final Non-Disclosure Agreement and the Side Letter signed by Ms. Daniels?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: What were the general terms of the Agreement? Were they the same as the Agreement that had been sent to you on October 11th?

Michael Cohen: Yes. In consideration for the $130,000, that she had transferred all rights assigned to the life rights of the story, and it also contained/states punitive damages of $1 million per violation clause.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you let Mr. Trump know once you received it that you had it?

Michael Cohen: Immediately.

Susan Hoffinger: Why did you do that?

Michael Cohen: For two reasons. One, so that he would know the matter, the task that he gave to me was finished, accomplished and done. But, also, to take credit for myself, so he knew that I had done and finished it. Because this was important.

Susan Hoffinger: Let's take a look at the Agreement first. Actually, let's take a look at -- let's take a look at the Agreement first.

Susan Hoffinger: Let's put up People's 276, please.

Susan Hoffinger: Is this the final Settlement Agreement and Side Letter Agreement signed regarding the Stormy Daniels matter?

Michael Cohen: This is one page of it, yes.

Susan Hoffinger: We can scroll down just so that you see it is the final Agreement.

Michael Cohen: [Nods yes.] Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Did Mr. Trump sign this Agreement anywhere?

Michael Cohen: No.

Susan Hoffinger: Why not?

Michael Cohen: Because, again, the purpose of it was to ensure his name didn't appear anywhere, as he's a candidate for the Presidency of the United States of America, and this would not have been to his benefit to do so.

Susan Hoffinger: Who signed on his behalf?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we take a look at the first page, please, lower right.

Susan Hoffinger: Do you see some initials for DD?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: What did that stand for?

Michael Cohen: David Dennison.

Susan Hoffinger: Who did that reference?

Michael Cohen: That was supposed to be Mr. Trump's pseudonym.

Susan Hoffinger: What are the initials put upon that?

Michael Cohen: EC.

Susan Hoffinger: What did that stand for?

Michael Cohen: Essential Consultants.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you put that signature there?

Michael Cohen: That's my signature, yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you do that on each of the pages of the Agreement?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we take a look at Page 14 -- actually, Page 15 of the PDF where there's some signatures.

Susan Hoffinger: Blow that up.

Susan Hoffinger: Do you see a signature by Stephanie Clifford?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Susan Hoffinger: What's the signature below that?

Michael Cohen: That's my signature on behalf of Essential Consultants LLC.

Susan Hoffinger: What's the date on it?

Michael Cohen: October 28th of 2016.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, you'll see that above that, there is a line for DD. Is there a signature there?

Michael Cohen: No.

Susan Hoffinger: Is that for the reasons you just discussed?

Michael Cohen: For the same reason. There's also secondary intent here that since it's an LLC, ultimately, what I would do down the road is just transfer the LLC to Mr. Trump, and it didn't require then to have his signature or anything attached, he would still be the beneficial owner of it.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we take a look at the Side Letter Agreement, which is on Page 17 of the PDF.

Susan Hoffinger: Just as a reminder, what was the purpose of this Side Letter Agreement?

Michael Cohen: This was a document, a one of one, that would identify who the pseudonyms referenced.

Susan Hoffinger: Was this the Agreement that you said only you were going to have possession of?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Susan Hoffinger: Who is identified here as being the David Dennison in the Settlement Agreement?

Michael Cohen: Donald Trump.

Susan Hoffinger: Let's look at the third to last paragraph on Page 18 of the PDF.

Susan Hoffinger: What does this indicate in terms of who would keep the Side Letter Agreement?

Michael Cohen: Both Keith Davidson and myself, counsel for the parties.

Susan Hoffinger: Does it say "attorney's eyes only"?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Susan Hoffinger: Is that for the reason you described, as to keep it confidential?

Michael Cohen: Yes. That was the whole purpose of this transaction.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we take a look at Page 18 on the Agreement, the signature blocks on the Agreement.

Susan Hoffinger: Who are the signatories on this Side Letter Agreement?

Michael Cohen: Stephanie Clifford, Keith Davidson, and myself.

Susan Hoffinger: The signature line is blank for David Dennison?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Susan Hoffinger: Is it for the reasons you just disclosed?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Look at Page 19, finally, of the PDF, Exhibit B. Q Take a look at the signatures there.

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Who signed this Agreement, which is Exhibit B of the Agreement?

Michael Cohen: Stephanie Clifford on behalf of Peggy Peterson, and my signature on behalf of Essential Consultants LLC.

Susan Hoffinger: What is the initials below your signature there?

Michael Cohen: DD.

Susan Hoffinger: Was that you signing on behalf of David Dennison?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Thank you. You could take that down.

Susan Hoffinger: You mentioned that you spoke to Mr. Trump about finalizing this Agreement.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we take a look at People's 349 in evidence. Can we take a look at the call between Mr. Cohen and Mr. Trump at 11:48 AM for 5 minutes and 16 seconds.

Michael Cohen: October 28th of 2016, I made a call to Mr. Trump that lasted 5 minutes and 16 seconds at 11:48 in the morning.

Susan Hoffinger: Was that the same day that you signed the Non-Disclosure Agreement and the Side Letter Agreement to finalize this deal?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: What did you discuss with Mr. Trump on this call?

Michael Cohen: That this matter is now completely under control and locked down pursuant to the Non-Disclosure Agreement.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you indicate to him that the documentation had all been finalized?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: You can take that down. Can we now put up People's Exhibit 180 in evidence, please.

Susan Hoffinger: I want to direct your attention now to November 4th of 2016. Approximately how many days before the election was this?

Michael Cohen: Several days.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you learn at around this time that The Wall Street Journal was going to release an article with the story about AMI had paid off Karen McDougal?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: How did you first learn, if you can recall, that an article like this was going to be published?

Michael Cohen: I don't recall who sent me the text. It could have been Hope or somebody else.

Susan Hoffinger: But, did you understand ahead of time what the article, generally, was going to be about?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you understand ahead of time that in addition to the story being, largely, about Karen McDougal, that there might be a mention of Stormy Daniels as well?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: What did you do when you found out that The Wall Street Journal was going to be publishing such an article?

Michael Cohen: Contacted Keith Davidson.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you -- before we get to Keith Davidson, did you also contact Hope Hicks?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you contact David Pecker?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: And what was your effort in contacting folks like David Pecker and Hope Hicks at around this time?

Michael Cohen: So that we can all coalesce around this issue in an attempt to, again, quell the potential effects that would result from an article like this.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we take that down just for a moment and bring up People's 338 in evidence.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we highlight the calls between Mr. Cohen and Hope Hicks on November 4, 2016?

Susan Hoffinger: Do you see a number of calls that day, Mr. Cohen, that you had with Hope Hicks?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Susan Hoffinger: What was the substance of your calls with Ms. Hicks that day?

Michael Cohen: Getting our hands around this article, figuring out how to change the narrative and how to quash any of the negative results that would come from it, as it was days before the election.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you discuss with Hope Hicks what the Trump campaign's response might be to this article?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And what was the gist of the statement that was going to be sent to The Wall Street Journal on behalf of the campaign?

Michael Cohen: Deny it.

Susan Hoffinger: Did Ms. Hicks tell you before -- withdrawn. Did Hope Hicks share with you a draft statement that she was going to send to The Wall Street Journal?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Can you take that down and put up People's Exhibit 318 in evidence.

Susan Hoffinger: Do you recognize that?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Susan Hoffinger: Tell the jury what that is. What's reflected in that document?

Michael Cohen: This is an email from Hope Hicks, dated Friday, November 4, 2016, to me. It states: "We have nothing to do with this final attempt by the liberal elite to disparage Donald Trump and stop this historic movement. We have no knowledge of this false story allegedly being shopped around, although it comes as no surprise -- yet another publicity hungry individual with a get rich and famous quick scheme at the expense of Mr. Trump." What she was sending to me was a series of ideas and thoughts to use for the media and to put out to the media.

Michael Cohen: Again, to get control over the release of that article.

Susan Hoffinger: Was she sending you several different options for the campaign to spin as a response to this article?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And was she looking for you to provide some advice to her?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you offer your input here on the campaign -- the Trump campaign's response?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we scroll up to your email response to her.

Michael Cohen: So, after reviewing her four different options, I thought best -- again, it's the same day, 11-4-2016. This is now taking place at 5:40 PM. And I sent this email to Hope Hicks. My comment to her is: "Instead, say: These accusations are completely untrue and just the latest despicable attempt by the liberal media and the Clinton machine to distract the public from the FBI's ongoing criminal investigation into Secretary Clinton and her closest associates."

Susan Hoffinger: Thank you.

Michael Cohen: You can take that down.

Susan Hoffinger: You mentioned that you also reached out to Keith Davidson?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Tell us about --

Susan Hoffinger: Well, first, can we show People's Exhibit 337. Can we cull out the seven calls Mr. Cohen had with Keith Davidson on that day.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you have a number of calls with Mr. Davidson on that day?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: Describe, generally, the calls you had with Mr. Davidson on that day.

Michael Cohen: I wanted to ensure that Ms. Daniels did not go rogue, that any of the people that she had known weren't providing any statements or information regarding this.

Susan Hoffinger: Let me ask you also a question: Did you also discuss with him Karen McDougal?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Had Mr. Davidson represented Ms. McDougal, as well as Stormy Daniels?

Michael Cohen: He represented both.

Susan Hoffinger: What, if any, discussion did you have with him -- that article we looked at was, largely, about Karen McDougal?

Michael Cohen: It was mostly, 95 percent of it, 99 percent of it was Karen McDougal.

Susan Hoffinger: What, if anything, did you discuss with Mr. Davidson on those phone calls about Karen McDougal?

Michael Cohen: That she was also under control, that nobody is going rogue here.

Susan Hoffinger: In addition to that, did you express any anger at Mr. Davidson for that article?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Why?

Michael Cohen: Because she was his client, and I expected that he would have this under control. Again, it was days before. And I wanted to ensure Mr. Trump was safe.

Susan Hoffinger: Were you angry with him?

Michael Cohen: Very.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you think someone on his side had leaked something like this to The Wall Street Journal?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you indicate to him that somebody might be very upset with him?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: Who did you indicate might be very upset with him?

Todd Blanche: Objection. Leading.

Michael Cohen: Mr. Trump.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Susan Hoffinger: What, if anything, did you tell him about Mr. Trump during those calls?

Michael Cohen: That he was really angry, and I truly hoped that we don't come back to find out that this is something that you guys did where -- this is -- this is a major problem.

Susan Hoffinger: Did Mr. Davidson issue some comments and denials to The Wall Street Journal in response?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Were you satisfied at that point?

Michael Cohen: That was the way he was going to appease me. More importantly, to appease Mr. Trump.

Susan Hoffinger: Thank you. You can take that down.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you also speak with Dylan Howard on November 4th of 2016 about The Wall Street Journal article?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we show People's 339 in evidence.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we cull out four calls with Mr. Howard on November 4th of 2016.

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you have a number of calls with him, as well?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: What, generally, did you discuss with him?

Michael Cohen: The Karen McDougal article.

Susan Hoffinger: Was there a concern -- what, if any, concern did you -- on the part of AMI was there about this article?

Michael Cohen: Well, remember that AMI was now in contract with Karen McDougal for the two covers as well as the, um, 24 articles that were to be penned. And I was expressing to him also, in a rather angry manner, that: She's now part of your team. You need to get a hold of this and also start issuing denials.

Susan Hoffinger: You can take that down.

Michael Cohen: Can you also put up 340 in evidence.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you also have a number of calls with David Pecker on November 4th of 2016?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: What, generally, did you discuss with him?

Michael Cohen: Same -- same matter and the same statements that I had made to Dylan Howard.

Susan Hoffinger: Thank you. You can take that down. Now, can we show People's 262 in evidence, please.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we pull up, in particular, some texts on November 4th of 2016 between Michael Cohen and Keith Schiller.

Michael Cohen: So, on November 4th of 2016, at 7:26 PM, I received a text message from Keith Schiller, asking me if I can take a call in 30 minutes. My response immediately was: "Of course."

Susan Hoffinger: Thank you. You can take that down. Can we put up People's 341 in evidence now.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we highlight the calls between Mr. Cohen and Mr. Schiller on 11-4 -- November 4th of '16.

Susan Hoffinger: What does this call summary reflect?

Michael Cohen: This reflects my conversation with Mr. Trump, who was with Keith Schiller at the time.

Susan Hoffinger: And this is -- the call here is at approximately 9:06 PM?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: For about five minutes?

Michael Cohen: Five minutes, 55 seconds.

Susan Hoffinger: Almost six minutes. And do you believe you spoke to Mr. Trump using Mr. Schiller's phone at that time?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Do you recall the substance of your conversation with Mr. Trump, just generally?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: What was it?

Michael Cohen: This was a real serious, again, problem. Especially being that it was so close to the -- Election Day. And I told him exactly who I had spoken to, the sum and substance of my conversations with each of them: David said he, as well, was going to get to the bottom of all of this. I had Dylan Howard on board.

Michael Cohen: I even had Keith Davidson. That we were going to be issuing denials and do everything within our power to protect Mr. Trump.

Susan Hoffinger: Was he angry, upset on that call?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Did he stress why he was upset?

Michael Cohen: Because there was a negative story that, once again, could impact the campaign as a result of women.

Susan Hoffinger: Thank you. You can take that down.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, after The Wall Street Journal article came out with this story about Karen McDougal, largely, did you have some texts with Hope Hicks right after the article came out?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Can you put up, please, People's 259 in evidence. Your Honor, is there a time you want to take a break?

Juan Merchan: This a good time?

Susan Hoffinger: Perfectly fine.

Juan Merchan: Let's take our afternoon recess. You can step out.

Court Officer: All rise.

Note: [Whereupon, the jurors and the alternate jurors are excused.]

Juan Merchan: You can step out.

Note: [Whereupon, the witness is excused.]

Juan Merchan: I am not going to rush you. I want to get a sense of how much you have.

Susan Hoffinger: I believe I'll be going into some portion of tomorrow.

Juan Merchan: Thank you.

Court Officer: Part 59 is back in session.

Juan Merchan: You can get Mr. Cohen.

Court Officer: Witness entering.

Note: [Whereupon, the witness, Michael Dean Cohen, having been previously duly sworn and/or affirmed, resumes the witness stand.]

Juan Merchan: Let's get the jury.

Court Officer: Jury entering.

Note: [Whereupon, the jurors and the alternate jurors are present and properly seated.]

Court Clerk: Case on trial continued. All jurors are present and properly seated.

Note: [Continued direct examination by Susan Hoffinger.]

Susan Hoffinger: Mr. Cohen, when we left off, we were talking about the day The Wall Street Journal article came out about Karen McDougal and whether you had some texts with Hope Hicks on that day. Do you remember that?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we put up People's 259 now, please, in evidence.

Susan Hoffinger: Do you recognize these texts, Mr. Cohen?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Susan Hoffinger: Let's direct Mr. Cohen's attention to cells 10, 11 and 12 on the record.

Susan Hoffinger: Texts dated November 4th of 2016. Can you read those texts?

Joshua Steinglass: November 5th. Those are November 5th.

Michael Cohen: November 5th.

Susan Hoffinger: My apologies. Correct. November 5th. That's the day after the article came out?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Can you read the texts with Hope Hicks on that day?

Michael Cohen: It's from me to Hope Hicks at 7:35 AM: "So far I see only six stories. Getting little to no traction." Hope then responds to me: "Same." Then she continues with: "Keep praying. It's working."

Susan Hoffinger: What did you mean when you said, "So far I see only six stories. It's getting little to no traction?"

Michael Cohen: The concern was, again, that this story would explode into a massive issue, and we were monitoring to see the type of traction that the story was getting from other news sources. So far, she only found six stories. I found six stories. And we were, again, hoping, praying that it was working, that what we did in terms of the denials and reaching out to the various media outlets was suppressing the story itself.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we take a look now at cell 13 and 14 on Page 2. This is another text on November 5th of 2016. Can you read that?

Michael Cohen: Yes. Again, November 5, 2016. From me to Hope. "Even CNN not talking about it. No one believes it and if necessary, I have a statement by Storm" -- Stormy -- "denying everything and contradicting the other porn star's statement. I wouldn't use it now or even discuss with him as no one is talking about this or cares." Her response to me: "Agree."

Susan Hoffinger: What did you mean here by a reference to "a statement by Stormy?"

Michael Cohen: As per the earlier statements that I made when I had reached out to David Pecker, Dylan Howard, Keith Davidson, the goal was to be able to obtain statements from them and use them and issue denials to the sum and substance of the conver -- of the article.

Susan Hoffinger: Where you indicated that if you needed to, you could get a statement from Stormy Daniels if you needed to?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, can you please take a look at cell --

Susan Hoffinger: Pull up cell 17 and 22 on Page 2 at 11:24 AM.

Susan Hoffinger: Can you read those texts, please?

Michael Cohen: This is November 5th of 2016 from Hope to me: "David Pecker's cell?" And she responds again: "I have it but he thinks it's wrong." I then sent her David's cell number, contact information. She says: "That's the same one. Thanks." I then send a response: "He called me from this number this morning." Hope responds to me: "The spoke.

Michael Cohen: All good." I think she meant: They spoke. All good.

Susan Hoffinger: What did you understand her to mean by "Spoke. All good?"

Michael Cohen: Mr. Trump.

Susan Hoffinger: Spoke with who?

Michael Cohen: I believe with David Pecker.

Susan Hoffinger: Four days later, or at that point a few days later, on November 4th -- withdrawn. On November 8th of 2016, a few days later, did Mr. Trump win the election?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, after Mr. Trump was elected President in November of 2016, was there going to be a continuing role for you at The Trump Organization?

Michael Cohen: No.

Susan Hoffinger: Why not?

Michael Cohen: Because my service was no longer necessary, as I was Special Counsel to Mr. Trump, and he was now President-Elect.

Susan Hoffinger: So, with Mr. Trump leaving, would there be anybody for you to work with or report to at The Trump Organization?

Michael Cohen: No, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Was that because you previously reported directly to him?

Michael Cohen: And only to him.

Susan Hoffinger: After Mr. Trump was President-Elect, were there some discussions about potential roles for you in the White House?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Were you offered a position as Assistant General Counsel?

Michael Cohen: Yes. It was something that Reince Priebus had offered to me.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you want that role of Assistant General Counsel?

Michael Cohen: No, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Did Mr. Trump or anybody working for him on the transition team ever offer you the position of Chief of Staff?

Michael Cohen: No, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Was that disappointing for you, that you were not offered or your name was not considered for that role?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Explain. What was the disappointment?

Michael Cohen: Well, I didn't want the role. I didn't believe the role was right for me or that I was even competent to be Chief of Staff. I just wanted my name to have been included in the fact that I had not once, but twice, started the campaign, been a surrogate. After all of this going through, I had other ideas for myself, what I wanted, but I wanted to at least be considered.

Michael Cohen: It was more about my ego than anything.

Susan Hoffinger: Did some of your friends or your colleagues suggest to you that you should have been considered for that role?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you indulge some of that conversation?

Michael Cohen: I did. I indulged them.

Susan Hoffinger: For the reasons you explained, that you would have liked --

Michael Cohen: I would have liked to have been considered. It would have been right. Again, it was solely for my ego.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, at some point during this transitional time period, so from November to December, did you pitch to Mr. Trump another role for you after he became President?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: What was the role that you -- or the title role that you pitched to him?

Michael Cohen: Personal Attorney to the President.

Susan Hoffinger: And what were the reasons that you wanted that title, that role, Personal Attorney to the President?

Michael Cohen: First of all, I thought that he would need it because there was still outstanding matters that we were dealing with. And every President has a personal attorney. So, my thought was: That way I can continue to protect him, to do the things that he needed with these other matters and it would be protected.

Michael Cohen: I also had another thought in mind, which was consulting. And that's what I really wanted. Because it also afforded me the opportunity to stay at home with -- or stay in New York with my son, my daughter, my wife. None of them wanted to go to D.C.

Susan Hoffinger: Was -- when you say it would afford you an opportunity to do consulting, did you have an idea of how you might use this title of Personal Attorney to the President to your benefit?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Explain that to the jury.

Michael Cohen: Sure. As Personal Attorney to the President, it opens up a tremendous amount of doors for people who are trying to understand Mr. Trump. Unlike a Hillary Clinton or any other President or politician, they're known. They have a history. Mr. Trump was an enigma. He was a businessman, and nobody knew what his feelings were, what his positions were on a multitude of different areas.

Michael Cohen: Because of my close proximity to him for a decade, I did understand it. And I started to receive, early on -- literally, when I was -- like, literally, the day after the election, people would say: Hey, this is a great idea. There are people who are going to want to speak to you because they need to formulate their next four years of his Presidency to benefit their business.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you think that, in a way, that you could monetize your being Personal Attorney to the President?

Michael Cohen: Absolutely.

Susan Hoffinger: In what way monetize?

Michael Cohen: You know, with consulting agreements to various different companies who wanted to understand Mr. Trump and understand what his positions and his feelings are on certain topics or issues.

Susan Hoffinger: Did that become your plan about what to do going forward?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: In December of 2016, did you make, sort of, a formal pitch to Mr. Trump about your having that position, Personal Attorney to the President?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: Can you explain that a bit?

Michael Cohen: Yes. So, on several occasions, Mr. Trump would say: "So, what role is Michael taking?" Reince Preibus would say: "I'm not sure yet. I've been here ten minutes. You've been here ten years." Then we go back to my office, and I say to Reince, "It's all good. It's all good. It's not what I wanted." So, I again pitched to Mr. Trump my interest in being Personal Attorney to the President.

Michael Cohen: In order to assist me, I actually brought in an attorney who is incredibly knowledgeable in history and presidential history, and he prepared a memorandum. This was like a three-page memo. And we sat with the President-Elect at the time for about an hour, and he went through this pitch, explaining the importance and necessity of having a personal attorney for his own protection and why I fit exactly that role.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, in connection with that pitch that you made to President-Elect Trump at that time, in that meeting, did you discuss anything with him about potential compensation for that title?

Michael Cohen: No, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Why didn't you?

Michael Cohen: Because I didn't expect to be compensated. I knew that the compensation was going to come from the companies that were already interested in speaking to me.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, did you mention to some other folks at The Trump Organization that you had asked Mr. Trump for that title of Personal Attorney to the President?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Was one of the people that you mentioned that to Allen Weisselberg?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you have discussions with your family about you wanting that title, Personal Attorney or Counsel to the President?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: I'd like to show just to the witness, please, and Counsel and the Court, People's Exhibit 258 for identification.

Note: [Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens of the witness and the parties.]

Susan Hoffinger: Do you recognize this document?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Susan Hoffinger: What is it?

Michael Cohen: These are text communications between myself and my daughter.

Susan Hoffinger: And what, generally, do they relate to?

Michael Cohen: To the position and the fact that I was not being considered for Chief of Staff.

Susan Hoffinger: And are these texts exact copies of text communications you had with your daughter on those issues at the time reflected in this document?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: I offer in evidence People's Exhibit 258.

Todd Blanche: No objection.

Juan Merchan: Accepted into evidence.

Note: [Whereupon, People's Exhibit 258 is received in evidence and is shown on the screens.]

Susan Hoffinger: There are quite a few texts on there. Can you summarize to the jury what's comprised in this text?

Michael Cohen: Sure. So, my daughter and I are very close. We're very much connected. And she was concerned that I was upset that I was not being considered for the role. I explained that Reince Priebus was pushing like a madman early on. But I explained to her that there are so many opportunities. "Like what?" I said: "When they come closer, I'll tell you all of them." At the time, when I was communicating with my daughter, she was at college at the University of Pennsylvania.

Michael Cohen: And I didn't want to get into the ideas that were going on because they were still in a formulation state. And so, she asks me: "Are the opportunities in government or no?" And I explained to her: "It's a hybrid." And what I was referring to as "a hybrid" is meaning as Personal Attorney to the President, I would continue to have my continued access to President Trump, and I would still be able to monetize my relationship and my ability with these various different companies.

Note: [Whereupon, Senior Court Reporter Lisa Kramsky relieves Senior Court Reporter Laurie Eisenberg, and the transcript continues on the following page.]

Note: [Continued direct examination by Susan Hoffinger.]

Susan Hoffinger: Did there come a time, ultimately, that Mr. Trump then gave you that title, Personal Counsel to the President?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Do you remember -- do you know approximately when that occurred?

Michael Cohen: It was in January, like a day or two before he left for the Inauguration.

Susan Hoffinger: You can take that down. Thank you so much.

Susan Hoffinger: I want to direct your attention to December of 2016, when you were still at The Trump Organization. Before President-Elect Trump gave you the title of Personal Attorney to the President, was it customary in that time period, December of 20 -- December of every year, actually, for employees to receive an end-of-year bonus?

Michael Cohen: It was for me.

Susan Hoffinger: So, December of 2016, did you find out -- well, withdrawn. How did you generally find out what your bonus was in December of each year?

Michael Cohen: So, after Mr. Trump would leave, he would be on a plane or he had already arrived to Palm Beach, Mar-a-Lago, Rhona would walk around with a Christmas card, and it would be signed by Mr. Trump and others, wishing you a Happy New Year, Merry Christmas, et cetera, and in it would be a check.

Susan Hoffinger: And was it --

Michael Cohen: And that's how you would find out what your bonus is.

Susan Hoffinger: So now, in December of 2016, just before you left The Trump Organization, how did you find out what your bonus was?

Michael Cohen: Rhona came and delivered the envelope, the Christmas card.

Susan Hoffinger: And that year, December of 2016, was Mr. Trump in the office when you received that bonus check in a card?

Michael Cohen: No.

Susan Hoffinger: Do you know where he was at the time?

Michael Cohen: He was in flight or had already arrived.

Susan Hoffinger: You mean in Florida?

Michael Cohen: In Florida.

Susan Hoffinger: When you opened up the card and saw the check, how did you feel about your 2016 bonus?

Michael Cohen: Angry. Beyond angry.

Susan Hoffinger: Why were you angry?

Michael Cohen: He cut my bonus by two-thirds.

Susan Hoffinger: And had Mr. Trump, at that time, in December of 2016, repaid you yet for the $130,000 that you paid out for Stormy Daniels?

Michael Cohen: No.

Susan Hoffinger: And so, how did you feel about the situation of him cutting your bonus and then also not repaying you yet for the Stormy Daniels payout?

Michael Cohen: I was truly insulted, personally hurt by it. I didn't understand it. It made no sense. After all that I had gone through in terms of the campaign, as well as things at The Trump Organization, in laying out $130,000 on his behalf to protect him, it was insulting that the gratitude shown back to me was to cut the bonus by two-thirds.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you express your anger about the situation to Mr. Weisselberg?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Would you tell the jury about your conversation with Mr. Weisselberg about that?

Michael Cohen: So, right after opening it, I actually had to take a double take and then immediately went to Mr. Weisselberg's office in the back and in some very colorful language expressed to him how truly pissed off and angry I really was. This makes no sense. At all. But I used quite a few expletives.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, did you mention in that conversation with Mr. Weisselberg that he also hadn't repaid you for the 130,000?Senior Court Reporter

Michael Cohen: Yes. I mentioned the fact that: You didn't lay out the money, I did. You weren't prepared to lay it out, I did. And the best that you get for showing loyalty, the best that you get for extending yourself as I did is have your bonus cut by two-thirds. I didn't expect more, but I certainly didn't expect less.

Susan Hoffinger: Did Mr. Weisselberg generally know what executives like yourself were getting as bonuses end year?

Michael Cohen: Yes. Every year Allen had the list, and he would sit down with Mr. Trump and they would go through it before the checks were prepared.

Susan Hoffinger: And so, was part of your anger also at Mr. Weisselberg for allowing your bonus to be cut?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: What was Mr. Weisselberg's response to you at that time to the anger that you expressed to him?

Michael Cohen: Take it easy. You know that Mr. Trump loves you. We are going to do right by you. We will make sure that -- we are going to make sure that you are taken care of. Just go. Enjoy your vacation. Relax. We are going to do -- we will make this right.

Susan Hoffinger: And did he tell you when it would be made right?

Michael Cohen: After the holiday, when everybody returned to the office.

Susan Hoffinger: What was your understanding about whether your impact -- withdrawn. What was your understanding about whether your anger had any impact on Mr. Weisselberg?

Michael Cohen: I think it did, in light of all of the things that I had just been involved with and helped to resolve. I was, even for myself, unusually angry. [Laughter]

Susan Hoffinger: Did you complain to a few other people also about your anger about not being repaid and also having your bonus cut?

Michael Cohen: I'm sure I did.

Susan Hoffinger: Do you know whether you expressed your upset with David Pecker?

Michael Cohen: I'm sure I did.

Susan Hoffinger: Do you recall specifically any conversation with David Pecker about your end-of-year bonus?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Can you just tell the jury a little bit about that, what you recall?

Michael Cohen: Yeah. I engaged him in conversation: Could you believe this? I mean, it's like after all of this, and laying out $130,000 to protect him, this is the best that I get? And I couldn't believe it. I was really -- I -- and it was, it wasn't even so much about the number as much as it was about the, sort of, disrespect that came with it. And I was just -- just personally insulted.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you ask Mr. Pecker to help you with it?

Michael Cohen: I -- I don't recall.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you also complain to Keith Davidson about it at some point? Do you remember having a phone call with him?

Michael Cohen: I might have had a phone call with Keith Davidson.

Susan Hoffinger: Also complaining about the situation?

Michael Cohen: I may have mentioned it. I'm not so sure that -- Keith Davidson and I didn't really know each other, other than his representation of Ms. Clifford and Ms. Daniels, whereas David Pecker I had a much longer relationship with. So, I'm not sure that I was complaining to Keith Davidson as much as I probably just mentioned it.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, did you go away with your family on holiday?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: And did Mr. Trump call you while you were on vacation?

Michael Cohen: He did.

Susan Hoffinger: Can you tell the jury a bit about that conversation?

Michael Cohen: He called me just before New Years, just to say: Hello. How are things going? Are you enjoying the vacation? Next year, you should come to Mar-a-Lago. Don't worry about that other thing. I'm going to take care of it when we get back.

Susan Hoffinger: What did you understand him to mean by that?Senior Court Reporter

Michael Cohen: What he meant was the two-third diminution in the bonus..

Susan Hoffinger: Did he mention at all -- what, if anything, did he mention about any conversation that he had with Allen Weisselberg?

Michael Cohen: That he spoke to Allen and that he knows that I was angry, but it's going to -- we will take care of it when we all get back.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, after you had returned to the office, after your holiday, did there come a time in January of 2017 when you had a meeting with Mr. Weisselberg concerning the repayment of the $130,000 that you had gave to Stormy Daniels?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Tell us how that came about?

Michael Cohen: Well, it's now after the new year, and I had laid out this money with the understanding that it was going to be paid back to me, how I was going to be reimbursed for this, and there was no conversation about it. So, I, of course, brought it up to Mr. Weisselberg to ask: "When am I getting the money back?"

Susan Hoffinger: And what, if anything, did he say about trying to resolve that with you?

Michael Cohen: So he said to me: "Let's sit down. Let's meet and let's do it."

Susan Hoffinger: What, if anything, did he ask of you to provide to him?

Michael Cohen: So he asked for me to bring him a copy of the statement showing the $130,000 transfer.

Susan Hoffinger: And --

Michael Cohen: From First Republic Bank.

Susan Hoffinger: And did he say anything to you at all about -- in connection with that meeting or in that conversation, about settling things globally and the position that you wanted?

Michael Cohen: Yes, because we were -- not only was it about the position, but also about other matters that were still open and outstanding, for example, the bonus, as well as an issue with a company called Red Finch.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you provide him with a document showing the transfer of the $130,000 to Keith Davidson for Stormy Daniels?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you say it was a bank statement from First Republic Bank?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we put up People's Exhibit 35, please, in evidence.

Note: [Displayed]

Susan Hoffinger: Do you recognize this document?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Susan Hoffinger: What is it?

Michael Cohen: This is the bank statement for Essential Consultants for the period of October 26th of 2016 through the 31st of October of 2016.

Susan Hoffinger: What does it show?

Michael Cohen: This is the document that I gave to Allen.

Susan Hoffinger: What does it show, this document?

Michael Cohen: It shows the deposit of $131,000, and the withdrawal of $130,035.

Susan Hoffinger: Does it show where the payment went to?

Michael Cohen: It does.

Susan Hoffinger: What does it show?

Michael Cohen: It shows domestic wire funds debit to Keith M. Davidson Associates PLC.

Susan Hoffinger: And this is a document that you gave to Mr. Weisselberg without the handwriting initially?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Susan Hoffinger: So let's look at the handwriting now. Whose handwriting is at the bottom right?

Michael Cohen: That's my handwriting.

Susan Hoffinger: And whose handwriting is at the bottom left and middle?

Michael Cohen: That's Allen Weisselberg's.

Susan Hoffinger: And how were you able to recognize Allen Weisselberg's handwriting?

Michael Cohen: Well, I recognize the handwriting, but I was also there in the room when he was writing it.

Susan Hoffinger: Over the years you've seen his handwriting and you've watched him write on this document?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, tell us what Allen Weisselberg told you at the meeting, including what he told you to write on that document?

Michael Cohen: So for Tech Services that were done. And it's regarding a different type of a matter, one that I had gone to Mr. Trump with on a regular basis in order to -- it was to purchase IP addresses and things like that. The total that was due to Red Finch was $50,000. But that was actually done, like, two years earlier.

Susan Hoffinger: So did Mr. -- what, if anything, did Mr. Weisselberg tell you about what to put down about those monies that were owed to Red Finch from two years earlier?

Michael Cohen: Include everything as -- obviously, I was no longer going to have a position at The Trump Organization, there was no way for me to get that money back or to have this matter done --

Susan Hoffinger: What, if anything, did he tell you to do in terms of totaling the monies owed to Red Finch and the monies that you had paid out to Stormy Daniels to Keith Davidson?

Michael Cohen: So the 130,000 was obviously the money that went for the Non-Disclosure Agreement. He told me to add up the 130 with the 50,000 for Red Finch. Total it to 180,000. Thirty-five was lost, that was just a wire transfer fee. Then he told me what he was going to do was to, it's called "Gross it up," because I was taking it -- because I was taking it as income.

Michael Cohen: And in order to get back the 180, you need to actually double it because of tax purposes, being I was in the 50 percent tax bracket, City, State and Federal. So, in order to get back the 180, what he did was, he then wrote down 360,000.

Susan Hoffinger: Did he tell you that he wanted to gross up that number of 180,000 to 360,000?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And what was your understanding about why he said he needed to gross it up to 360,000?

Michael Cohen: Because otherwise you wouldn't get back your 180. It would be, obviously, less. If they gave me the 180, and they didn't gross it up, after taxes onto it, it would be 90. Then, that's, again, assuming that you take it as income as opposed to just a wash.

Susan Hoffinger: Let me back up just for a second. Were you previously -- you were familiar with paying expenses for something, in other words, The Trump Organization, did you ever pay out any expenses for a business trip or something like that?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And when you submitted it to The Trump Organization, if you laid out $100 as an expense, what did you get back?

Michael Cohen: One hundred dollars.

Susan Hoffinger: So it was not grossed up, the reimbursements were not grossed up generally from the Trump Organization, to your knowledge?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Susan Hoffinger: And was it Allen Weisselberg's idea that it should be grossed up to $360,000?

Michael Cohen: And that it should be taken as income.

Susan Hoffinger: And so, was it his suggestion that you take it as income instead of a reimbursement?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, you mentioned Red Finch. The payment plus the $50,000 to Red Finch. And I think you mentioned that it was some services that a tech company had provided to Mr. Trump?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And you said it was a couple of years earlier?

Michael Cohen: Yes, it was earlier.

Susan Hoffinger: And had they completed the work for Mr. Trump?

Michael Cohen: They did.

Susan Hoffinger: And had you discussed with Mr. Trump the work that was done and completed and that he owed Red Finch $50,000?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: And did he decide to pay Red Finch the money that theySenior Court Reporter were owed?

Michael Cohen: No.

Susan Hoffinger: And, briefly, without describing details, why did he tell you that he didn't want to pay them?

Michael Cohen: Because he didn't feel that he had gotten the benefit of what he wanted, which dealt with the ranking.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, did you end up paying out some money yourself to Red Finch?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: How did that come about?

Michael Cohen: So I happened to know the CEO of Red Finch, and he explained to me that: This isn't fair, I'm out money, I had to acquire -- lay out money for the IP addresses that we were obtaining and requesting. And each time that I needed to go back for more, I would go to Mr. Trump's office asking and requesting that he give me the permission.

Michael Cohen: And so, I said to him, let me -- I said, I'll -- I'll take care of it -- I'll take care of you. I needed him for other things that I was working on for Mr. Trump's benefit. And so I went to my bank and I took out money to give him because he told me he was going to be coming into New York from Virginia.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you pay him the full $50,000? That was the bill?

Michael Cohen: No, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: And given that you didn't pay him the whole $50,000, why did you put down $50,000 on there?

Michael Cohen: Well, for the previous year and a half I had told Allen: Look, I laid it out. My hope was to get it, the money from Allen onto it, so that I can give it to him. But it never happened, but I constantly reminded him because I did want him, you know, to receive the funds.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you pay Red Finch less than $50,000?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: Okay. And why did you then ask for $50,000 back?

Michael Cohen: Because that's what was owed and I didn't feel Mr. Trump deserved the benefit of the difference.

Susan Hoffinger: And if you were going to get $50,000, but you paid out less than 50,000, were you going to keep the rest of it for yourself?

Michael Cohen: That's what I ended up doing.

Susan Hoffinger: And just to go back to one thing. Did Allen Weisselberg -- was Allen Weisselberg able to approve the repayment to Red Finch for $50,000 without Mr. Trump's approval?

Michael Cohen: No.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, was there another piece to this repayment to you? I think where we left off, you said that Mr. Weisselberg said you needed to gross up the 180,000 to 360,000 to make it look like income, is that right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Susan Hoffinger: Was there something else that you were going to be repaid?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: What else?

Michael Cohen: The -- in addition to the bonus that he had already been previously given to me of $60,0000.

Susan Hoffinger: And what did he tell you about that $60,000 additional bonus?

Michael Cohen: That this is the best that he's going to get and...

Susan Hoffinger: Did he say anything about trying to make it right because your bonus had been cut?

Michael Cohen: Yes. Though, it was still short of what I expected, but he thought that this was going to be an amount that would make it right.

Susan Hoffinger: So, in addition to grossing up the 180 to 360, added on to that was another $60,000 for some additional bonus?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Susan Hoffinger: And what was the total that he wrote -- so is that, those calculations on the left side by Mr. Weisselberg?

Michael Cohen: They are.

Susan Hoffinger: And that's his handwriting?

Michael Cohen: It is.

Susan Hoffinger: So what -- can you just tell the jury about the additions and the calculations there that Mr. Weisselberg wrote?

Michael Cohen: So you take 360 and add 60 to it, it was 420,000.

Susan Hoffinger: And what, if anything, did he indicate about the 420,000 at that point, if anything?

Michael Cohen: Well, he didn't at that point. It was only after we had spoken to Mr. Trump about the $420,000 which, obviously, I realized that they had already spoken.

Susan Hoffinger: Before you get to that. Just one question. I apologize. I just want to go back to something on the issue of Allen Weisselberg telling you that they were going to gross up the 180 that you had put out or stated that you had put out as an expense, of grossing it up to $360,000, so that it would appear to be income.

Susan Hoffinger: What was your understanding about Mr. Weisselberg's background in terms of accounting and taxes?

Michael Cohen: He's not a CPA. He has been Mr. Trump's CFO for well over four decades.

Susan Hoffinger: And as Chief Financial Officer, what is your understanding about whether he oversaw the Accounting Department at The Trump Organization?

Michael Cohen: He oversaw every aspect of the Accounting Department.

Susan Hoffinger: And, to your knowledge, did he also work with outside tax accountants?

Michael Cohen: He did.

Susan Hoffinger: And based on that, and your knowledge of working with him over the years, what's your understanding about his knowledge about taxes and accounting?

Michael Cohen: He certainly knows more than I do.

Susan Hoffinger: What, if any, understanding do you have about why he grossed that reimbursement up to $360,000?

Michael Cohen: I didn't know. And, to be honest, I didn't really even think about it. I just wanted to get my money back.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, at the end of the conversation that you just had with Allen Weisselberg, did you believe that you were or think that you were going to get that $420,000 back in one lump sum?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Okay. And following the meeting with Mr. Weisselberg and both of you adding that handwriting to People's 35, what did you do and where did the two of you go at that time?

Michael Cohen: We went to Mr. Trump's office in order to speak to him about this.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, when was this, approximately?

Michael Cohen: Right before the -- Mr. Trump left for the Inauguration.

Susan Hoffinger: So, was he still at Trump Tower at that time?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: What did you understand he was engaged in at Trump Tower at that time?

Michael Cohen: Being President-Elect.

Susan Hoffinger: Was he at meetings at Trump Tower?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, what happened when you went into Mr. Trump's office to have this discussion with him?

Michael Cohen: During the conversation, Allen turned around and said to me, ummm, while we were talking about this, it was -- and what we're going to do is, we're going to pay you over 12 months. It was probably better if I get it in one lump sum. No, no, no, no. Why don't you do it as over 12 months and it will be, ummm, paid out to you monthly.

Susan Hoffinger: And did he say anything about how it would be paid out as something?

Michael Cohen: Yeah, as like a legal service rendered since I was then being given the title as Personal Attorney to the President.

Susan Hoffinger: And we will get to that in a second. So was this conversation that you had with Mr. Weisselberg in Mr. Trump's office with Mr. Trump?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And did Mr. Weisselberg have with him this document, People's 35?

Michael Cohen: He did.

Susan Hoffinger: And did he show this document to Mr. Trump?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And did Mr. Weisselberg say in front of Mr. Trump how much you were going to be paid in total?

Michael Cohen: It was going to be divided by 12, and it's $35,000 a month, and that they would actually start making the payments in February, not January, because there was a lot going on with Mr. Trump moving to D.C., the Inauguration, and so on.

Susan Hoffinger: And did Mr. Weisselberg reflect those payments over 12 months on that bank statement, People's 35?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And can you just read what that says there in the middle or the bottom?

Michael Cohen: It says 420,000 divided by 12, that's an equal sign. And that's 35,000. And that's per month.

Susan Hoffinger: And so was it stated -- did Mr. Weisselberg state in front of Mr. Trump that you were going to receive $420,000 over the course of 12 months?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And what, if anything, did Mr. Trump say at that time?

Michael Cohen: He approved it. And he also said: "This is going to be one heck of a ride in D.C."

Susan Hoffinger: And did Mr. Weisselberg say in front of Mr. Trump that those monthly payments would be, you know, like a retainer for legal services?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, you mentioned something before, but I just wantedSenior Court Reporter to question you about it. Did you say something to the effect of that you had the sense that they had spoken about this previously?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Why do you say that?

Michael Cohen: Because they always played that sort of game of frick and frack type game. And I didn't -- I had been around that office more than enough to realize that this conversation had already taken place between the two. And when I asked for the 420, Mr. Trump said, no, it's better, it's better to do it over the 12 months.

Susan Hoffinger: And --

Todd Blanche: Your Honor, objection to that answer and move to strike.

Juan Merchan: Overruled. Overruled.

Susan Hoffinger: And when Allen Weisselberg laid out the plan of how much you were going to get paid and over what months and showed Mr. Trump this document, did Mr. Trump try to renegotiate?

Michael Cohen: No.

Susan Hoffinger: So he approved it at that point?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, at some point did Mr. Trump confirm to you that he was going to give you the title of Personal Attorney or Personal Counsel to the President?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: When in relation to this meeting was that?

Michael Cohen: Around the same exact time.

Susan Hoffinger: Okay. And was it -- did you have a conversation just between yourself and Mr. Trump about that role during that time?

Michael Cohen: I mean, we've had conversations.

Susan Hoffinger: Was it -- did Mr. Trump indicate to you that he was giving you the title?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Was it in this meeting or shortly after this meeting?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: One or the other?

Michael Cohen: It was one or the other.

Susan Hoffinger: And was it -- was the $420,000 that you were going to receive back from Mr. Trump going to be payment for future legal services as personal counsel?

Michael Cohen: That was what it was designed to be.

Susan Hoffinger: Well, what was it actually?

Michael Cohen: Reimbursement of my money.

Susan Hoffinger: It was. It was a repayment of which monies?

Michael Cohen: It was a repayment of the Stormy Daniels payment as well as, again, you had had the bonus and then the Red Finch money.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, you said that you believed that this occurred at Trump Tower some days before Mr. Trump actually left for Washington, is that right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Susan Hoffinger: And do you have a sense of -- based on some of your phone records about when this meeting occurred, about the grossed up reimbursements?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And also in connection with that, you would be given Personal Counsel to President Trump?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And, as a result of that, did you look at some of your phone records as well?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Susan Hoffinger: So let's pull up, please, People's Exhibit 250 in evidence, please.

Note: [Displayed]

Susan Hoffinger: I'm sorry, okay. Can you make that a little bit bigger. Thank you.

Note: [Displayed]

Susan Hoffinger: What is this text, Mr. Cohen? Who is it with?

Michael Cohen: This is a text message on January 17th from me to a gentleman named Gene Freidman, who was the manager or the operator of my yellow cab medallions in New York City. And I wrote to him, "Thank you. I leave tomorrow for D.C. And just between us, I will be Personal Counsel to President Trump."

Susan Hoffinger: And does that help you date the time of this meeting that you had with Allen Weisselberg and Donald Trump when you talked about the $420,000? And in connection with you, were you also at that meeting shortly thereafter being given the title Personal Counsel to Mr. Trump?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: I want to just go back to one question that I neglected to ask you. That document that we looked at, People's Exhibit 35, which contained the calculations that Allen Weisselberg did to get you from 180 to 360 and adding the bonus, and so on, did Mr. Weisselberg ever give you a copy of that document after all the handwriting had been put on it?

Michael Cohen: No.

Susan Hoffinger: What, if anything, did you know that he did with that document, if you know?

Michael Cohen: I believe -- I don't know. I believe he put it in a file.

Susan Hoffinger: And so, is your sense that -- based on this document, and perhaps another one, did you have a sense of the approximate timing of the meeting that you had with Allen Weisselberg and Donald Trump about the reimbursement?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: What's your approximation of when it was?

Michael Cohen: January 17th.

Susan Hoffinger: And could it have been the day before? Do you know for sure, based on this, whether it was the 16th or the 17th?

Michael Cohen: It could have been the day before. And the reason I say that is because I spoke to Gene Freidman on a very regular basis.

Susan Hoffinger: And you told him on the 17th that you were going to be Personal Counsel?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you also go on the Sean Hannity show the next day, on January 18th, and announce that you were going to be Personal Counsel to the President?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we just pull up People's Exhibit 251 in evidence as well, please.

Note: [Displayed]

Susan Hoffinger: Do you recognize that?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Susan Hoffinger: And can you tell us what those texts meant -- that text message is about?

Michael Cohen: This is a text message from a gentleman named Steve Denari to me, stating that he just seen me on Hannity and saw the announcement: "Congratulations on being President Trump's Personal Counsel." His word: "Consigliere." "Look forward to speaking with you further after the Inauguration."

Susan Hoffinger: And does that also date for you that you made that announcement on the Hannity show on January 18th?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, did Allen Weisselberg ask you to -- or did he tell you or discuss with you when you would be repaid those monthly payments for the reimbursement of the $420,000?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: What did he say?

Michael Cohen: That it would start in February, because with the Trust and with the movement going on of Mr. Trump going to D.C., it's going to just take a little bit of time to get things -- to get things moving, so just be patient.

Susan Hoffinger: Did he indicate something that you should do in terms of submitting something to get paid at some point?

Michael Cohen: Yes. But he --

Susan Hoffinger: Go ahead.

Michael Cohen: What he stated to me is each month, you know, just send an invoice to us and just mark down for legal services rendered pursuant to the Agreement and we will get you a check out.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, after Mr. Trump, President-Elect Trump gave you the title of Personal Attorney to the President, before you left, did you have a conversation with him about whether you would be compensated for any legal work that you might do for him in the future in that role?

Michael Cohen: No.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you -- did it come up at all, whether, you know, if you did some work, whether you would be paid for it?

Michael Cohen: I mean, when he said to me, yeah, you know, whatever you end up doing, you know, just take it easy on any bills, he goes. But I knew what he was referring to. He had given me this title, his Personal Attorney, and I was proud to accept that title, which I wanted, so I knew that there would be no compensation for any of the other work.

Susan Hoffinger: And so, did you have any expectation that if you did work for him you would be paid?

Michael Cohen: None at all.

Susan Hoffinger: And, from your perspective, how were you essentially getting paid for that title?

Michael Cohen: By monetizing the role as Personal Attorney and creating consulting agreement relationships.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, are you aware that when attorneys represent a client and receive compensation for work, that they are required to put together either a Retainer Agreement or a written Engagement Letter?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you ever put together any sort of a Retainer Agreement for any future work that you might do for Mr. Trump as Personal Attorney?

Michael Cohen: No, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Why not?

Michael Cohen: Because I knew there was going to be no compensation.

Susan Hoffinger: And did the $420,000 that you received have anything to do with being a payment for future work that you might do for Mr. Trump as Personal Attorney to the President?

Michael Cohen: No.

Susan Hoffinger: Judge, is this a good time to break?

Juan Merchan: Sure. We will stop now. Jurors, before I excuse you, I remind you to please not talk either among yourselves or anyone else about anything related to the case. Please continue to keep an open mind. Do not form or express an opinion about the defendant's guilt or innocence until all of the evidence is is in, and I have given you my final instructions on the law, and I have directed you to begin your deliberations.

Michael Cohen: Do not request, accept, agree to accept or discuss with any person the receipt or acceptance of any payment or benefit in return for supplying any information concerning the trial. Report directly to me any incident within your knowledge involving an attempt by any person to improperly influence you or any members of the jury.

Michael Cohen: Do not visit or view any of the locations discussed in the testimony. And do not use any program or electronic device to search for and view any location discussed in the testimony. Do not read, view, or listen to any accounts of or discussions of the case, that includes the reading or the listening to the reading of any transcripts of the trial, or the reading of posts on any court sites.

Michael Cohen: Do not attempt to research any fact, issue or law related to the case. Do not communicate with anyone about the case by any means, including by telephone, text messages, email, chat rooms, blogs, the internet. And do not Google or otherwise search for any information about the case or the law which applies to the case or the People involved in the case.

Michael Cohen: I will see you tomorrow at 9:30. Have a good night.

Court Officer: All rise.

Juan Merchan: Please be seated. Sir, you can step down.

Michael Cohen: Thank you, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: Anything that you would like to go over?

Susan Hoffinger: No, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: Mr. Blanche, anything you would like to go over?

Todd Blanche: No, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: Thank you very much. I will see everyone tomorrow. Have a good night.

Note: [Whereupon, at this time, the matter was adjourned to Tuesday, May 14th, 2024, at 9:30 a.m.]
