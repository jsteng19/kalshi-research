Note: [The following proceedings follow a SEALED sidebar proceeding consisting of Pages 3744 to 3748.]

Susan Hoffinger: We have additional objections at this time, Judge.

Juan Merchan: Do you want it to happen in open court?

Susan Hoffinger: I think I would rather that we remain at sidebar, but unless your prefer to do it in open court. You can decide, once I explain --

Juan Merchan: The press doesn't like it very much.

Susan Hoffinger: They will be able to read it later, I would assume. Your Honor, based on defense counsel's proposed jury charges, we understand that they will likely be asking Mr. Cohen today about Judge Furman's decision -- recent decision in the Southern District of New York. We understand that he may be able to inquire about it, but we would object to the decision going in as being extrinsic and collateral.

Susan Hoffinger: Also, we do think that if they go into that, meaning Judge Furman's decision, not what he testified to, that we would be, on redirect, seeking to admit Judge Engoron's decision about that testimony. So I just wanted to preview that. A couple of other things, just before the testimony continues, I don't know if we can do this on the fly as we go, so I wanted to preview it for the Court.

Susan Hoffinger: Defense counsel provided us with a number of exhibits. As you know, there are -- well, you may not know, there were some clips on Tuesday, but now there are -- I may be wrong -- but maybe close to 50 clips relating to Mr. Cohen's either TikTok or other programs, podcast programs. We have only the full clips -- I asked for the full clips for some of the exhibits that Mr. Blanche told me he was going to seek to admit, we don't have the full clips for the others, but I didn't know that he was seeking to admit them.

Susan Hoffinger: He may be seeking to use them. Of course, the witness may not really be able to determine what else was said on that podcast, but we do have some very specific objections for some of the clips that Mr. Blanche may seek to admit. One is, there has been significant testimony about Mr. Cohen's bias.

Juan Merchan: About what?

Susan Hoffinger: Mr. Cohen's bias, you know, his hostility towards the defendant, his making money off the defendant. And we did not even object to the exhibit relating to some of his merchandise -- we felt that it was going to come in, in any event -- but in that merchandise there are pictures of the defendant behind bars, in an orange jumpsuit.

Susan Hoffinger: Enough of that has come in at this point. A number of these clips, we think, are precluded by your Honor's decision on the motion, on the People's motion in limine, which is, they reference opinions about whether he should be in jail, whether he should be in handcuffs, whether he should have a mug shot taken.

Susan Hoffinger: First, our Office did not take mug shots, did not take fingerprints. Mr. Cohen probably is not I aware of that -- it's not something that he may or may not be aware of. But, at this point, we really think that this is intended to elicit something quite improper for the jury. And so, B35 -- just to go over a few of them -- B35 -- the other thing is that they are taken out of context.

Susan Hoffinger: So, for example, B35, had Mr. Cohen talking about, you know, something like mental excitement about seeing him in an orange jumpsuit, which is what they have excerpted. But what they haven't included is just before that clip and just after that clip his saying "that's not appropriate, that's not what we should be wanting, what we want is accountability, we should be seeking only accountability, we should be seeking due process, a fair jury, a fair Judge." So the context has been excerpted out of that.

Susan Hoffinger: We are left with an excerpt of a clip talking about excitement about seeing him in a jumpsuit, which, again, we think your Honor has precluded evidence of potential punishment or consequences in this proceeding. So if that is admitted -- we object to it, but if it's admitted, we are going to seek on redirect to submit the clip and its context.

Susan Hoffinger: And there are other clips, the other clips are similar in many ways, perp walk, handcuffs, et cetera.

Todd Blanche: Your Honor, we have provided all the clips to the Defense [sic]. Most of them --

Susan Hoffinger: To the Prosecution.

Todd Blanche: Thank you.

Susan Hoffinger: That's okay. That's all right. I feel the same way sometimes.

Todd Blanche: To the Prosecution. Most of them on Tuesday. More yesterday. We are not seeking to offer virtually any of them. They are just to refresh his recollection. Now, the People are correct, there are a few that we want to offer. We -- look, the law -- I don't need to pass it up to the Court -- but evidence of bias is always admissible and extremely important.

Todd Blanche: And extrinsic evidence of bias is always admissible. And, of course, the Court can limit it appropriately. And we are being judicious, in our view, and we are not offering 50 clips of him saying things. We are -- we have a handful that are targeted to his actual, in our view, his actual bias. We are talking about -- I believe we are seeking to actually admit three or four, maybe five short clips, that is out of hundreds that we could potentially seek to admit.

Todd Blanche: So evidence of bias is admissible. We have a ton of evidence of bias. We are seeking to admit extrinsic evidence of bias, which we are allowed to do. And in a handful of cases --

Juan Merchan: That's fine. But if it appears that you are taking that out of context, I have certainly no problem with the People going back into it on redirect --

Todd Blanche: Sure.

Juan Merchan: -- and showing that you took it out of context.

Todd Blanche: Your Honor, I very much appreciate that there is evidence out there from Mr. Cohen that they would want to offer on redirect. And them stating that I am opening the door to his bias, I don't -- I'm not suggesting -- I'm not suggesting is the opening of the door for that evidence.

Juan Merchan: Regarding Judge Furman's decision, are you going to bring that out?

Todd Blanche: No. But I don't know how he's going to answer questions. What I intend to ask him about is what happened with the AI case, the situation, and it is just that, what happened, and then ultimately ask, like I'm doing for all of his attempts to get out of supervised release early, just ask whether that was denied and not ask -- I'm not asking about anything about his findings or anything --

Juan Merchan: Okay.

Todd Blanche: -- because I believe that that's not allowed, it's just not -- the Engoron finding is not allowed.

Juan Merchan: All right.

Susan Hoffinger: Just two other things. I apologize. One of the clips that they are offering talks about Mr. Cohen -- from 2020, talks about Mr. Cohen's -- the cases that are -- the investigations that he believes are out there, meaning the Southern District investigation and the OAG investigation and an investigation by our Office.

Susan Hoffinger: And he talks about speaking with our office about all sorts of financial crimes. So if that does come in, that does open the door, your Honor, because that was ongoing into 2021 and that was on the clip. So we would certainly seek to clarify about that, so it will open the door. And we will argue that it does.

Todd Blanche: Well, it's a short clip. And he does make reference to the fact that he has gone to the District Attorney's Office about all kinds of financial crimes as well. To the extent that the People believe that opens the door to then redirecting him on evidence of financial crimes, then that certainly opens the door to a whole series of questions that I was not -- that I did not ask about, what this District Attorney thought about his testimony with respect to those financial crimes.

Todd Blanche: I mean --

Susan Hoffinger: It's not admissible.

Juan Merchan: Look, all I'm going to say is, as with everything else, proceed at your own risk. I can't rule right now. I haven't heard the question, and I haven't heard the answer. But proceed at your own risk. If the question and the answer leave the jury with an impression that may not be entirely accurate, the People will say that the door has been opened and I will rule on that then.

Todd Blanche: I just -- I don't understand about what the People are saying and what the Court's decision is. You would have an objection to even me asking him: You were meeting with the People about more cases than just this one, and having him say yes to that? I'm not trying to hide that from the jury, but if they don't --

Juan Merchan: Then what would be your concern with that?

Susan Hoffinger: Well, I do have a concern about it. Right now we are trying this case, and I think your Honor has precluded all of the rest -- we are talking about a tax case, we are talking about statements of financial conditions, and I think that opens the door. I just think that I wanted to bring it to the Court's attention that this particular clip talks about all other financial crimes that he was involved in, and it's in their clip.

Susan Hoffinger: If they do it, we might have to make some decisions. And that's including -- the question, I guess, is whether, if that's out there, whether the defendant gets cross-examined on that issue. Now, I know your Honor has made a ruling, I'm just -- I wanted to bring it to the Court's attention. A decision hasn't been made, but I did notice it on the clip and I think it presents some issues here.

Todd Blanche: It is on the clip. And, you know, we very much believe, and the Court will hear the clip, that it's not confusing to the jury. Especially if they -- if we elicit --

Juan Merchan: Let's see how it comes out.

Todd Blanche: Pardon me?

Juan Merchan: We will see how it comes out.

Todd Blanche: Yeah, sure. Understood.

Juan Merchan: We can all make all of the arguments we want, but we don't know what it's going to look like and what it's going to sound like, so let's wait on that.

Susan Hoffinger: One more thing, your Honor, and that's it. I believe the defense is offering B45, which is texts from Jeremy Rosenberg and Michael Cohen. They are excerpted, only certain portions of the texts that, without context, the context that they've excerpted out, are all of the very serious threats that Mr. Cohen was receiving, including some death threats that Mr. Rosenberg had to follow up on and our Office had to investigate.

Susan Hoffinger: If they are seeking to admit texts of that nature, well, first of all, we object. We don't think that this should come in. Your Honor had a concern about too much evidence coming in about threats to witnesses, especially because we have a jury who may be concerned. But we are going to object to the exhibit.

Susan Hoffinger: There is one portion on the first page, that's just about the phones, which would be admissible. But the rest of it is all about Mr. Rosenberg's trying to -- trying to make him feel better, given all of these threats that were happening. So we would object. And if it's admissible, we would like to put in all of the threats.

Juan Merchan: Mr. Blanche.

Todd Blanche: Your Honor, we redacted it for that -- for the reason the People just said, that there is some back and forth around threats. The excerpts that we are offering are 100 percent, in our view, continue to go to Mr. Cohen's bias. They are accounts about Mr. Rosenberg and Mr. Cohen talking about holding President Trump accountable, I believe, and he will hold him accountable, and then a further question about the fact that Mr. Rosenberg knows about Mr. Cohen's father.

Todd Blanche: We are not going to get into any details about that, but it goes to show the relationship that Mr. Rosenberg and Mr. Cohen had. So much so that there is a witness, and the detective knows details -- and we are not getting into details about his father, we're not getting into that, just to point out that they had a very close relationship.

Todd Blanche: As the Court knows, the phones are an issue, and that's what we are trying to bring out.

Juan Merchan: What you are describing --

Susan Hoffinger: I am handing up --

Juan Merchan: Okay.

Susan Hoffinger: I can hand up the exhibits, your Honor, the redacted and unredacted versions for you to review. Clearly, it goes to the witness' state of mind. So they can't bring in texts that are in response to the threats, because they then are not bringing in fulsome understanding of his state of mind at the time.

Todd Blanche: I agree with that. I would ask them to represent which one that we're offering is in response to a threat?

Susan Hoffinger: Sure. At the bottom, where -- on your redacted version, and I think the Court can see this on Page -- for some reason I stapled it wrong -- there is discussion all about "Staying strong. I get it. I truly understand the incredible turmoil you are experiencing." Mr. Cohen says, "Believe me, it's worse than you can possibly imagine." And you have redacted all of the threats, the telephone calls and the calls to his wife and the threats that he received from someone who was with an online program.

Susan Hoffinger: So I think the Judge will be able to see exactly what's redacted.

Juan Merchan: So, it sounds like if what you are doing -- you want to establish his state of mind and you want to establish something about the relationship, I suggest that you do something, something appropriate about the relationship, which is fair, which is fine. I think the People may very well be able to elicit why the investigator was trying to comfort him and trying to reassure him.

Susan Hoffinger: And we will be seeking to put in the full version, that's what we will be seeking to do.

Todd Blanche: We provided these to the People midday yesterday. I think if we would have gotten an objection to a few of the lines, like that one, if it was anticipated, we would have been able to agree to redact. I'm getting into this right away, actually, so if I could have two minutes, I can just go make sure I take that out.

Susan Hoffinger: Just so the record is clear, I would say you sent me the redacted version of this exhibit at 9:38 p.m. last night. The original version I didn't object to, but the redacted version you sent me late last night when I asked for it is what I am objecting to.

Juan Merchan: So you need to take a moment to fix that?

Todd Blanche: Excuse me?

Juan Merchan: You need two minutes?

Todd Blanche: Yes.

Juan Merchan: So going forward, please don't wait until I come down to discuss these things.

Todd Blanche: All right.

Juan Merchan: If you want to come down in advance to discuss issues like these, I can come down earlier.

Susan Hoffinger: Thank you.

Juan Merchan: Just one second, before you slip away. The schedule is a little bit up in the air right now. And, as you know, we have some pretty large breaks coming up because of graduations and travel plans and the holiday, so at this moment you should plan on working next Wednesday.

Todd Blanche: We should plan on working on Wednesday?

Juan Merchan: It may not happen. It could be that it won't happen, but right now you should plan on that.

Todd Blanche: So that is very much fine with us. I will tell you that we have a hearing scheduled in the Southern District of Florida on Wednesday. Now, it's -- we are only part of a very small motion and our intention was to seek permission from Judge Cannon that President Trump be excused. In the past, she has agreed.

Todd Blanche: We will, obviously, state that the trial is ongoing. I do not anticipate that she will say no, but just so the Court is aware that there is an oral argument scheduled. Obviously, we will -- if we are sitting here, we won't be there, and I'm okay with that and so is Mr. Bove. We have local counsel who can cover.

Todd Blanche: But I do need -- we will try to work on putting that letter in today. We won't say publicly that it's before that Court, so we will be careful --

Juan Merchan: Now, when I went back and I looked at the motion in limine again, my decision on the motion, nothing has changed. You know, if you want to make further argument, you know, if you want to change something, that's fine, but I haven't heard anything yet at trial that would change my decision on that issue.

Todd Blanche: Understood. And we may have --

Emil Bove: I think what we were going to address at 4:00, Judge, is a proffer from us about what we would seek to elicit, so that we can have a sense of whether it's going to be worthwhile to do this.

Juan Merchan: All right. We will do that after the jury is excused today.

Todd Blanche: Yes, your Honor.

Emil Bove: Yes, your Honor.

Joshua Steinglass: Are you going to ask the jury about their availability on Wednesday?

Juan Merchan: Yes. So what I would normally do, I just tell the jurors, look, it's possible we may need to work on Wednesday, would that present a hardship for any of you? If it does, raise your hand. I don't -- I'm not crazy about putting them in that position. But I prefer to do that rather than have a court officer or somebody else ask those questions.

Todd Blanche: Okay.

Susan Hoffinger: Judge, may I raise another issue? It's very short, and I apologize. On Tuesday, someone -- some of the defense guests filed in in the middle of direct examination with their security detail. And I noticed that some of his guests are already here today with their security detail. But we would just ask that they not be allowed to file in, in the middle of Mr. Blanche's cross-examination.

Susan Hoffinger: It's -- with their security detail for the jury and the witnesses to see.

Juan Merchan: Yes. I would advise that that not happen.

Todd Blanche: Your Honor, I have less than zero control over what is happening on anything or anyone that's behind me when I am crossing a witness. I don't know what -- I don't have any control over that. I mean, they are members of the public.

Juan Merchan: Are you expecting anybody else today?

Todd Blanche: Your Honor, I have no idea. No. I'm not expecting anybody else, but I might be wrong.

Juan Merchan: Oh, okay.

Juan Merchan: I apologize for all of the whispering, I think we may be able to get started. Was there anything else that you wanted to go over with the Court?

Todd Blanche: No, Judge. Thank you. There was nothing else. I just wanted to remind you that I asked for one minute to deal with something.

Juan Merchan: Sure.

Todd Blanche: Thank you, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: Are you ready?

Todd Blanche: Yes.

Juan Merchan: All right. Let's get the witness, please.

Court Officer: Ready for the witness, your Honor?

Juan Merchan: Yes.

Court Officer: Witness entering.

Note: [The witness, Michael D. Cohen, enters the courtroom and resumed the witness stand.]

Juan Merchan: Good morning, Mr. Cohen.

Michael Cohen: Good morning.

Juan Merchan: I will remind you that you are still under oath. Let's get the jury, please.

Court Officer: All rise. Jury entering.

Juan Merchan: You may be seated.

Court Clerk: Do both parties stipulate that all jurors are present and properly seated?

Joshua Steinglass: Yes.

Todd Blanche: Yes.

Juan Merchan: Thank you. Good morning, jurors. Welcome back. Jurors, first, I would like to apologize for keeping you waiting. I know that you were all here early just waiting for us, but we had to take care of some business. I apologize for that. Second, as you know, our scheduling the coming week or weeks is kind of broken up by holidays and various conflicts, so if possible it may be necessary for us to work next Wednesday.

Juan Merchan: However,, what I'm going to ask you to do is let the Sergeant know during the next break if that creates a hardship for any of you. If any of you are unable to work next Wednesday, we just won't be able to work and that's fine, that's okay, but it's important so that we can plan. Okay. Thank you. Mr. Blanche.

Todd Blanche: May I inquire?

Juan Merchan: Yes.

Todd Blanche: Thank you, your Honor.

Note: [Continued cross examination by Todd Blanche.]

Todd Blanche: Good morning, Mr. Cohen.

Michael Cohen: Good morning.

Todd Blanche: So when we stopped on Tuesday, we had just started talking about an individual named Detective Jeremy Rosenberg. Do you remember that?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: Who is he?

Michael Cohen: He works with the District Attorney's Office.

Todd Blanche: Was he -- going back a year or so to the beginning of 2023, was he one of the detectives that you interacted with, for -- when you were coming to court to meet with the prosecutors, to get your phones, that sort of thing?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And did you text with him?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Todd Blanche: And you texted with him on his work phone, correct?

Michael Cohen: I believe so, yes.

Todd Blanche: And you also texted with him on a different number, his personal phone, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: Now, just to remind the jurors, Mr. Rosenberg came on two separate occasions in January to pick up your phones, which you had consented to the District Attorney doing, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And I'm going to show you, just for you, the parties and the Court, what has been marked for identification as B117. And I'm going to ask that you take a look at that. And it's a couple of pages and it's redacted. I'm sorry. It's a couple of pages. So we will flip through pages while you just take a look at it and let me know if that appears to be the texts, some of the texts you had with Detective Rosenberg?

Todd Blanche: We can flip through as well.

Todd Blanche: Do those appear to be the texts you -- some of the texts that you appear to have with Detective Rosenberg?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: Now, there are -- these aren't all of the texts, though, correct, what you are looking at?

Michael Cohen: So far, no.

Susan Hoffinger: Judge, may we approach for a moment?

Juan Merchan: Sure.

Susan Hoffinger: Judge, there are addresses all over these texts and they are not redacted.

Todd Blanche: We are not looking for or at the addresses.

Susan Hoffinger: I know, but it shouldn't appear for the defendant and all of those behind him, presumably.

Todd Blanche: I will take that down.

Juan Merchan: Please take those down.

Susan Hoffinger: Thank you.

Todd Blanche: We can take down the exhibit, please. Can we put up the redacted version, B118.

Juan Merchan: B118 in private only, Mr. Blanche, that's in private only?

Todd Blanche: Yes. And we don't have to put that up there. That's my fault. That's my fault, a miscommunication. Can we put up B45, just for the defendant, the parties and the Court -- I'm sorry, the witness, the parties and the Court.

Todd Blanche: Take a look at this, Mr. Cohen, again. This is a couple of pages.

Todd Blanche: We can flip through those.

Todd Blanche: So do you recognize those as being -- again, there are redactions, but some of the texts that you had with Detective Rosenberg last year?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And did those, assuming -- knowing those redactions, do those texts accurately reflect what you wrote to him and what he wrote to you about a year ago?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: The defense offers B45.

Susan Hoffinger: May I have a voir dire, your Honor?

Juan Merchan: Sure.

Note: [Voir dire examination by Susan Hoffinger.]

Susan Hoffinger: Mr. Cohen, when you say they accurately reflect your communications with Mr. Rosenberg, are there large spots that are redacted in these texts?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: And are they, therefore, out of context without those unredacted portions?

Michael Cohen: I believe so.

Susan Hoffinger: We object, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: Please approach. .

Juan Merchan: So, I, again, sustained an objection --

Susan Hoffinger: Uh-huh.

Juan Merchan: I am going to allow it in and give you an opportunity to then go back and reread it, if either party wants to do.

Susan Hoffinger: I think we should keep it out.

Todd Blanche: I mean --

Joshua Steinglass: Judge, let's not use the unredacted version.

Susan Hoffinger: Or put in the fully unredacted version, your choice.

Todd Blanche: I believe it's appropriate, your Honor, on redirect, if they believe that there is something that is taken out of context, that they want to offer it, then they can, but it's just that this is just the People's belief.

Juan Merchan: Except that right now we only have -- we have knowledge of it in advance before it even comes in, we know in advance it's going to be taken out of context, and we know that you have an unredacted version that you can offer. I don't think it makes sense for us to just play that game. Why don't you just go ahead and introduce the unredacted portion.

Juan Merchan: I will sustain the objection to this document.

Susan Hoffinger: Thank you.

Juan Merchan: The objection is sustained.

Note: [Continued direct examination by Todd Blanche.]

Todd Blanche: So the texts that you just read between you and Mr. -- Detective Rosenberg, those were around the time you testified in the Grand Jury in this case, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: Now, and you saw a text, you saw texts just now where you and Mr. Rosenberg -- Detective Rosenberg were discussing how you were going to hold President Trump accountable, correct?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Todd Blanche: Now, you recall the leak -- that there was a leak that the indictment had been returned in this case. Do you recall that?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: Overruled. You can answer.

Michael Cohen: I'm sorry. One more time, please.

Todd Blanche: Do you recall that prior to the indictment being unsealed in this case, it was leaked to the media. Do you recall that?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: Can you please rephrase.

Todd Blanche: Do you recall whether prior to the indictment being unsealed, the public learned that President Trump had been indicted?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And did you yourself learn that President Trump had been indicted prior to it being unsealed in this courtroom?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: And you learned that from reading the New York Times, is that fair?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And Detective Rosenberg confirmed it to you, that the New York Times story was accurate, correct?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: Overruled. You can answer.

Michael Cohen: I'm sorry, one more time, please.

Todd Blanche: Detective Rosenberg confirmed to you that the New York Times article was accurate and that President Trump had been indicted, correct?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Todd Blanche: Did Detective Rosenberg confirm that "It Was Done" to you?

Michael Cohen: I'm sorry. I don't understand your question.

Todd Blanche: Well, let's put up, just for you, the Court and the People, B45 again.

Todd Blanche: And if we can go towards the end, the second to last page of that exhibit. And the page before for one minute. And, now, if you can turn to the next page. You can take that down.

Todd Blanche: Does that refresh your recollection that Detective Rosenberg told you that "It Was Done," meaning President Trump had been indicted?

Michael Cohen: He identified a newspaper article.

Todd Blanche: Your testimony is the text you just read was Detective Rosenberg identifying a newspaper article?

Michael Cohen: That's what it says, yes.

Todd Blanche: Detective Rosenberg didn't tell you that they told the New York Times before they told you? Did he tell you that in a text?

Michael Cohen: I'm sorry. I don't understand your question. It's confusing.

Todd Blanche: Did Detective Rosenberg tell you, before the indictment was unsealed in this case, that they told the New York Times about the indictment before they told you?"

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained. When you say "they," who are you referring to?

Todd Blanche: Well, that was going to be my next question to this witness, your Honor.

Todd Blanche: Do you have an understanding about whether Detective Rosenberg told you about the indictment before it was unsealed?

Michael Cohen: No, sir.

Todd Blanche: He didn't tell you before there was an unsealing in this courtroom that it was done, meaning that President Trump had been indicted?

Susan Hoffinger: Asked and answered, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: Overruled. You can answer.

Michael Cohen: No, sir.

Todd Blanche: Are you sure about that?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: So, when did you learn about President Trump getting indicted?

Michael Cohen: From the New York Times article.

Todd Blanche: And did you have a communication with Detective Rosenberg about the New York Times article?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And what did he tell you?

Michael Cohen: He stated -- well, I asked him or texted him: "Nice to find out through the New York Times article. Nice for a head's up."

Todd Blanche: Isn't it true that he texted you: "I know you heard." And you said: "Nice head's up, huh, tell the Times first?"

Susan Hoffinger: Objection, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Todd Blanche: Did you sustain the objection?

Juan Merchan: I did.

Todd Blanche: So your testimony, sir, is that you did not hear from Detective Rosenberg before it was unsealed in this case that President Trump had been indicted?

Michael Cohen: I don't recall hearing from Jeremy Rosenberg that, no, sir.

Todd Blanche: Now, that same day, March 30th of last year, okay, you went on CNN, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: And that's when you -- you said on TV, that: "This indictment and this case was like David against Goliath." Do you remember saying that?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And when you said that, you were describing yourself as David and President Trump as Goliath, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And you actually said on March 30th, so before the indictment was unsealed, that you had Goliath on his back, didn't you?

Michael Cohen: Sounds correct.

Todd Blanche: And that same day, Detective Rosenberg complimented you and said, you were so sharp and competent, saw the fantastic interview on CNN just now?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained again.

Todd Blanche: Your Honor, may we approach?

Juan Merchan: No.

Todd Blanche: Do you have a recollection, Mr. Cohen, of Detective Rosenberg texting you about your appearance on CNN?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: What did he tell you in that text?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Todd Blanche: Do you recall on March 31st going on TV with a reporter named Joy Reid?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And, again, this is Friday, March 31st, so it's when the indictment is still under seal, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And do you recall Detective Rosenberg complimenting you about your interview on Joy Reid?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: Overruled. You can answer.

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: Now, that was at the same time that the Manhattan District Attorney's Office was telling you not to do TV, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: Now, do you recall going on your Mea Culpa podcast right around that time, on March 30th, 2023, and talking about the indictment?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: So I want to play for you and the parties and the Court, B46. So if you -- I think you have them. Do you have the headphones there, Mr. Cohen?

Todd Blanche: This is just for the parties, the Court and the witness. Okay. Can you pull that up?

Note: [Audiotape playing for the aforementioned parties only.]

Todd Blanche: Were you able to hear that, Mr. Cohen?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: Please use the microphone.

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: You were able to hear that. And that was your voice, that was just a portion of that Podcast, right, that was just a snippet, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: And that was on May 30th, 2023, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: Your Honor, we offer B46.

Susan Hoffinger: Just for the reasons discussed at the bench, we object.

Juan Merchan: As discussed at the bench, the objection is overruled. And we will accept it into evidence.

Todd Blanche: And if we can play that for the jury now, B46. Thank you.

Note: [Audiotape so being played in open court at this time.]

Todd Blanche: Now, you said on that podcast that you wanted to thank the Manhattan District Attorney's Office and their fearless leader, Alvin Bragg, with whom you spent countless hours. But you never met Alvin Bragg, correct?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: And what you just said about picturing President Trump being led through the booking process and whatnot, that wasn't the first time, meaning May 23rd, 2023, that wasn't the first time that you said you wanted President Trump to get a taste of what you went through, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: So, do you remember a podcast, October 23rd, 2020, where you discussed similar things. Do you remember that?

Michael Cohen: Specifically, no, but I'm sure I did.

Todd Blanche: Well, let's take a listen.

Todd Blanche: If you would play that just for the Court, the parties and the witness. If we could play B25. So, sir, if you could put your headphones on again, Mr. Cohen. Thank you.

Note: [Audiotape played for the aforementioned parties only.]

Todd Blanche: You heard that portion of your podcast? Again, that wasn't your whole podcast, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: It was just a small portion?

Michael Cohen: A small portion of that.

Todd Blanche: That was your voice on October 23rd, 2020, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct, it is.

Todd Blanche: The defense offers B25, your Honor.

Susan Hoffinger: Based on the Court's ruling, no objection.

Juan Merchan: Accepted into evidence.

Todd Blanche: If we could play B25 for the jury. Thank you.

Note: [Audiotape so being played in open court at this time.]

Todd Blanche: And, now, you said that October 23rd, 2020, right, so that wasn't around the time of the indictment in this case, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: Now, in that same podcast, would it surprise you to learn that you also said that "you are not going to lie, thinking about Donald Trump and his family sitting in Otisville prison makes you giddy with hope and laughter?"

Michael Cohen: Sounds correct.

Todd Blanche: And so, in that instance, just to remind the jury, Otisville is a Federal prison that you spent about a year at, is that correct?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: And you testified on Tuesday that you did not enjoy being in prison, did you, Mr. Cohen?

Michael Cohen: No, sir.

Todd Blanche: You've also said that you believed that the work that you did doing interviews with the prosecutors through interviews, your hours spent with prosecutors, your media statements and your podcasts, you believed that that played a role in the indictment in this case, didn't you?

Michael Cohen: I took some credit, yes.

Todd Blanche: Well, I'm not -- I'm not trying to put words in your mouth. I'm not asking you whether you took credit. You said, did you not, that you believed that the work that you did played a large role in the Prosecutor's indictment of President Trump in this case?

Michael Cohen: Yes. That's what I believe.

Todd Blanche: And we talked about it a little bit on Tuesday, and the Prosecutors asked you about it as well, but we just played two, but there are countless others from your podcasts that are similar to what we just heard, correct?

Susan Hoffinger: I'm just going to object as to form.

Juan Merchan: Overruled.

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And there are -- you continued to call President Trump various names on your podcast and when you are even doing CNN interviews, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: So that's continued even up to during this trial, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: Now, do you remember --

Todd Blanche: If we can put up exhibit, it's already in evidence, 408A.

Note: [Displayed]

Todd Blanche: Do you remember when the Prosecutor showed you this, this is a Truth that President Trump sent on March 15th, 2023. Do you remember when the Prosecutor showed you this?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: Now, about five lines down, it says, "And convicted liar and felon, jailbird Michael Cohen may have schemed up." And you testified, I believe, that that was directed at you, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: Now, you responded to this Truth, didn't you?

Michael Cohen: I'm not on Truth Social, sir.

Todd Blanche: So if --

Todd Blanche: We can take that down. So if I can show you, just you and the parties and the Court -- Well, we will come back to that.

Todd Blanche: Well, you don't have a recollection of responding on X to that Truth?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And you responded in kind, right, you called President Trump a name right back, correct?

Michael Cohen: Sounds correct.

Todd Blanche: You called him "Dumb Ass Donald." Does that sound right?

Michael Cohen: Sounds correct.

Todd Blanche: Now, we talked a little bit about your statements during this trial that you've made on your podcast and on TikTok. Do you recall on April 21st, 2023, saying on your TikTok that you have mental excitement about the fact that this trial was starting?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And that was April 21st, so that was right before opening statements in this case, is that right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: Opening statements were on the 22nd, the next morning, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And you knew at the time that there was a paralegal at the District Attorney's Office that was monitoring your social media, right?

Michael Cohen: I believe so, yes.

Todd Blanche: Well, let me just make sure I understand your answer. You did know at the time or you believed that a paralegal was monitoring your social media?

Michael Cohen: I believe that there was a paralegal monitoring my social media.

Todd Blanche: And you knew that that was happening when you made all of the statements that you made in the past several months, including during this trial, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: But that didn't -- it certainly didn't stop you, did it, Mr. Cohen?

Michael Cohen: No, sir.

Todd Blanche: Now, I want to talk about something the prosecutors talked about for awhile on Tuesday, which is your prior -- your prior testimony under oath. Now, you testified under oath on many occasions, right?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: Many over the years. You have testified in depositions, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: You testified before Congress seven times, is that right?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: You testified in a trial last fall, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: You -- when you -- we talked about your guilty pleas, there were two of them, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And in both of those court hearings you testified, or you answered questions under oath, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: Now, was the oath that you took every single time, so going back to all of the depositions, the same oath that you took on Monday morning in this courtroom?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: The oath doesn't change depending on the location, does it?

Michael Cohen: No, it does not.

Todd Blanche: And you were asked to do the same thing every single time, right, you put your right hand up, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: You swear to tell the truth?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: Exactly like what you did in this courtroom?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And when there are times, like now, when your testimony lasts longer than a day, just because you come back the next day or in this case, two days later, you are still under oath, right?

Michael Cohen: The Judge advised me of such, yes.

Todd Blanche: The Judge reminded you that you are still under oath because of your oath that you gave on Monday morning?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And that wasn't just here, that's happened any time that you've testified and there has been a break, whether it's overnight or even a lunch break, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: So, in addition to the times that you testified under oath where you raise your right hand and swore to tell the truth, you've also met with Federal agents, I believe, somewhere around 17 times? Does that number sound right?

Michael Cohen: Sounds right.

Todd Blanche: And each time you met with the Federal agents, you were told that if you made a false statement, that that was a felony, that was a Federal crime, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: So you -- and just so that the jury understands, that happens when the meeting starts. So at some point early on you are in a conference room usually and there are some agents, maybe some FBI Agents, there are some prosecutors, your lawyer is there, and early on in the meeting you are told, Mr. Cohen, you can't lie to these agents, you have to tell the truth or something like that, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: Now, I want to talk about, again, your testimony in 2017 before the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: That's one of the times that you have lied under oath, correct?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: And just so -- just so everybody is clear about how that transpired, you submitted a two-page letter in advance of your testimony, correct?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: And then when you testified, you kind of adopt the letter, you even read the letter into the record, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And that happens after you are sworn in and you take the oath, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And on that occasion, you lied about this, the Moscow Project, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And your lies -- there were a couple of different lies, correct?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: The number of times when you stopped the Project was a lie, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: You said you stopped it in January, it actually lasted a little bit longer, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: You -- the number of times you spoke with President Trump, you said, was a lie, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And what was the other lie?

Michael Cohen: I don't -- I don't recall. I think those --

Todd Blanche: You don't recall the other lies?

Michael Cohen: I think those were the two.

Todd Blanche: Well, did you tell -- did you tell the Committee that you never agreed to travel to Russia and -- in connection with that Project, and that you never even considered asking President Trump to travel to Russia, right, you testified to that and that was not true?

Michael Cohen: True, correct.

Todd Blanche: So those were the three lies that you -- that you committed when you testified in 2017, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: Now, just to be clear, you knew, at the time that you submitted that letter and that you made those statements, that you were lying under oath, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And you have said, and you said on Monday and Tuesday, that the reason you lied was because of your loyalty to President Trump, correct?

Michael Cohen: I said that, yes.

Todd Blanche: But that's a different -- your reason for lying is different from whether you knew you were lying, right, you knew you were lying, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: And then, when you -- when you met with the Special Counsel, August 7th of 20 -- of the next year, right, so two weeks before you pled guilty in SDNY on August 7th, you met with the Special Counsel, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And you lied again about those same three topics with respect to the Trump Moscow Project, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: So just as it relates to that issue, you lied under oath, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And you lied -- you committed another felony in the meeting with --

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Todd Blanche: I'm going to rephrase that.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Todd Blanche: And you lied again when you met with the Special Counsel on August 7th, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And you, as we talked about, in November -- on November 29th of that year, 2018, you pled guilty to lying to Congress, correct?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Todd Blanche: You did not plead guilty, and you have never pled guilty to the lies in that meeting, though, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And, to be fair, you were truthful at sentencing about the fact that you had lied in the meeting, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: So there was no -- you weren't trying to hide that from the Court, you weren't trying to hide that from the Special Counsel. You had actually said you lied, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And so, when Judge Pauley sentenced you for that lie, he knew about the lie to Congress and he knew about the fact that you had lied to the agents as well, right?

Michael Cohen: I don't believe it was Judge Pauley.

Todd Blanche: You don't believe it was Judge Pauley who sentenced you?

Michael Cohen: No, Judge Pauley sentenced me. There was the second case.

Todd Blanche: Correct. But when you were sentenced in front of Judge Pauley, you were actually sentenced for both cases, correct? So, I can refresh your recollection?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: So, meaning -- what I mean by that is, you are correct, the guilty plea in November was in front of a different Federal Judge?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: But then your August guilty plea and your November guilty plea were combined so you could be sentenced in front of one Judge?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: And that was Judge Pauley?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And you remember Judge Pauley sentencing you to two months and a fine of $50,000 because of your lies to Congress, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And that was to run concurrently, which means at the same time, to the 36 months you got for the other crimes you pled guilty to, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: So when you were sentenced for that crime, your lawyers put in a sentencing memo, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And you spoke to the Judge?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Todd Blanche: And you said that you were accepting responsibility for those lies, for lying to Congress, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: But, in fact, you repeatedly said, and you even said this morning and early this week, that the reason why you lied was because of your loyalty to President Trump, correct?

Michael Cohen: I worked with the Joint Defense Agreement, and we crafted this document, that two-page document, in order to say one message, the message that we all knew Mr. Trump wanted, including with Mr. Trump's attorney at the time.

Todd Blanche: So, are you saying you are accepting responsibility or are you blaming the Joint Defense Committee?

Michael Cohen: Accepting responsibility. I read it and I submitted it to the Committee.

Todd Blanche: And so, you talked about what you just described, right, the fact that there was a Joint Defense Agreement and other lawyers participating in drafting that letter and you talk about that a lot, right?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Todd Blanche: You talk about that in your book?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: And you talk about that in your podcasts?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And even at the time that you pled guilty, right, so this was in front of the other Judge in November, you said, when you were talking about the lies, that you made those statements up to be consistent with President Trump's political messaging and out of loyalty to President Trump, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: Now, you also pled guilty on August 21st, so a few months earlier, in front of Judge Pauley to a bunch of other crimes, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: Now, the August 2018 guilty plea had to do with the investigation that you talked a lot about from the search of your hotel room, your office, TD Bank, safe deposit box and your home, your apartment, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: That was after the FBI raided your home in April of that year, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And the FBI took a lot of materials from you, hard copy materials, electronic materials?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: Telephones --

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: Cell phones?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: Now, you knew at the time that -- well, maybe not at the time, but before your guilty plea, you learned that one of the reasons why the FBI raided your -- raided your home and your hotel room was because they had a cooperating witness, right?

Michael Cohen: No, sir.

Todd Blanche: You were not aware that your business partner, Gene Freidman, cooperated in that case?

Michael Cohen: I know Gene Freidman cooperated, but I didn't know it at the time. No, sir.

Todd Blanche: Well, when did you learn that Gene Freidman cooperated?

Michael Cohen: Much later.

Todd Blanche: How much later?

Michael Cohen: Approximately two months or so.

Todd Blanche: Okay. Understood. So before you pled guilty in August, you knew that some of the evidence that the Southern District of New York had against you came from your business partner, right?

Michael Cohen: He's not my business partner, no, sir.

Todd Blanche: How would you describe him?

Michael Cohen: He was a management company, and I leased my medallions to him. I received from him a sum certain every single month, just as every one of the other thousand medallions that he was operating. I had no profit sharing with him. If he had loses, I would not have received any of the loses. It would be no different than if you were leasing an apartment from somebody.

Michael Cohen: I had no interest in his company at all.

Todd Blanche: So you used his company or, rather, maybe he used your medallions to try to make money and then you would get some of that as profit, is that correct?

Michael Cohen: No, sir.

Todd Blanche: Go ahead. Explain it to me?

Michael Cohen: The way the industry works is he is a licensed management company with the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission. I owned medallions, as there are 13,284 in the City of New York. He would lease my medallion or medallions with an agreement, with a contract, and he would pay me a sum certain every single month whether he made money or he didn't. No different than, again, leasing an apartment, if you use it or you don't, you are still paying the lease --

Todd Blanche: And there were times --

Michael Cohen: Oh, I'm sorry.

Todd Blanche: Oh, no. Go ahead.

Michael Cohen: He was obligated to pay all of the expenses, the tax stamp, the rate card. I had no obligations regarding the vehicle. That was all his. All he did was lease the medallions, because the only way to have a taxi is you have to have a medallion affixed to the front.

Todd Blanche: Understood. And he would pay you by check every month, is that right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And there were times when he didn't pay you and you had to chase him down and get your money, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: There were times when checks bounced?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And there were times when you had to go back and forth with him and say, hey, can I cash this check from you right now or does it have to wait until Monday, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: Now, he -- just so we understand, when you pled guilty in late August, you knew that he was cooperating against you, that Mr. Freidman was cooperating against you, right?

Michael Cohen: I was told that, yes.

Todd Blanche: Well, that's what "you knew" means, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: And you -- isn't it a fact, he's actually named in some of the paperwork associated with your guilty plea? He's Taxi Operator Number 2, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: So you plead guilty on August 21st, 2018, and a few minutes into that hearing, the same thing happened that happened on Monday morning, Judge Pauley has his deputy swear you in, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: So it doesn't happen right away, but at some point Judge Pauley says to his deputy, please swear in Mr. Cohen, and the same thing happens, that happened today, right -- I'm sorry, that happened Monday, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And Mr. -- and right after that, Judge Pauley actually told you that you were under oath and that if you didn't -- if you didn't testify truthfully, that you could get in additional trouble, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And then a little bit later in that proceeding, when you were talking about your conduct, you said, did you not, in the tax years of 2012 to 2016: "I evaded paying taxes on certain income that I received that I knew was not reflected on the return and that I caused to be filed," right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: You also said, in that same proceeding, after being placed under oath, that on or about February of 2016, in order to be approved for a HELOC, a Home Equity Line of Credit, you received an application form that did not accurately describe the full extent of your liabilities, but you did not correct the inaccurate information on the form.

Todd Blanche: You testified to that, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: You then later testified, in the same proceeding, that you signed that form, the HELOC form, knowing it would be submitted to the bank as part of the HELOC application process, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: You also said that you understood at the time that you were doing it, that the purpose of those documents were going to help influence the decision the bank made about your HELOC loan, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And you -- you said in that proceeding that you understood that because of the statements I just described, you were guilty of Federal Tax Evasion, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And you were guilty of Making a False Statement to a Financial Institution, correct?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: Now, nobody induced you to or threatened you to plead guilty, correct?

Michael Cohen: As I stated previously, I was provided with 48 hours within which to accept the plea or the Southern District of New York was going to file an 80-page indictment that included my wife and I elected to protect my family.

Todd Blanche: So you -- and that's what I was -- that's what I was getting to. So you do feel like you were induced to plead guilty?

Michael Cohen: I never -- [indicating with finger]. I never -- I never denied the underlying facts. I just did not believe that I should have been criminally charged for --

Todd Blanche: After --

Michael Cohen: -- for either of those two, or, I should say, six offenses.

Todd Blanche: I want you to just focus on my questions, okay. My question was, you felt that you were kind of induced or you were put under pressure to plead guilty because you were given just two days, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: You felt that if you were to make a decision immediately, there was a risk that your loved one, your wife would be indicted as well, correct?

Michael Cohen: That was what I was told.

Todd Blanche: Well, who told you that?

Michael Cohen: My lawyer.

Todd Blanche: So did the Government ever tell you -- did the Prosecutors from the Southern District ever say: If you don't plead guilty we are indicting your wife?

Michael Cohen: No. They spoke with my lawyer.

Todd Blanche: Well, based on what your -- so, to be clear, except for what your lawyer told you, the only basis for you believing your wife was going to get indicted was what your lawyer told you, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: But you said on countless occasions that that pressure of having your wife indicted and the short timeframe with which you had to make a decision was the reason why you pled guilty?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: But on that day, when you were under oath, in front of Judge Pauley, after you raised your right hand, Judge Pauley asked you, didn't you -- didn't he say to you -- or, well, did anybody offer you any inducements or threaten or force you to plead guilty to enter into this plea guilty? He asked you that, right?

Michael Cohen: He did.

Todd Blanche: And you said, "No?"

Michael Cohen: I accepted responsibility.

Todd Blanche: Sir, I didn't ask you if you accepted responsibility. We will get to that.

Michael Cohen: Okay.

Todd Blanche: I asked whether you said, "No," under oath to Judge Pauley, that nobody had threatened or induced you to plead guilty?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: That was a lie?

Michael Cohen: That was not true, correct.

Todd Blanche: Can we get through this. What's the difference between a lie and something that's not true?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Todd Blanche: You said "it's not true." What is the difference, in your mind, between something that is not true and a lie?

Michael Cohen: I said that's correct. I was using just a different terminology.

Todd Blanche: Okay. So you -- so it was a lie?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: Now, after you pled guilty in August, one of the things that happens is that you meet with a member of the Court staff and they draft what's called a Presentence Investigation Report, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And you did that in the Federal case that we're talking about, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: You met with somebody named Christopher Paragano?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And did you meet with him in person or over Zoom?

Michael Cohen: In person.

Todd Blanche: And Judge Pauley had told you during the guilty plea that it was important to be truthful and honest with your -- with that individual because it helped him decide what sentence to give you, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And even -- and so you met with him a few weeks later?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And even then, when you met with him and talked about the offense conduct, you blamed others, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: Much like what you did today, like you explained your conduct by saying that you really didn't think you committed the tax crime, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: You said you didn't think you should be -- you didn't think that you should be criminally charged for that, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And it was actually something that the pretrial services officer was concerned about when drafting the report, that you had not accepted responsibility, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And then you show up for sentencing in December, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: So like four months, five months later about, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And you are going to be sentenced for the August guilty plea and for the false statements to Congress at the same time, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And at the sentencing, your lawyers and you put in papers and you spoke to the Court, right?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: And at that point, you told Judge Pauley that you were accepting responsibility for your conduct, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And you did that and your lawyers were asking for a low sentence, correct?

Michael Cohen: In the sentencing memo, yes.

Todd Blanche: Well, and then your lawyer spoke at sentencing as well, right?

Michael Cohen: He did.

Todd Blanche: And that was Guy Petrillo, is that right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: Mr. Petrillo told the Court about your -- that you had been willing to cooperate with the Special Counsel, with the Mueller Investigation, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And talked to the Court about the fact that you were not a cooperating witness, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And the Southern District of New York had not offered you a Cooperation Agreement, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: But he still wanted you to get credit for cooperating, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: Ultimately, the Judge took all of that into account and gave you 36 months in prison, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And the fines you talked about on Tuesday?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And that 36 months in prison was lower than the recommended guidelines range, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: So the Judge, presumably -- not presumably, he said that he took into account your lawyer's arguments when sentencing you to 36 months, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And then -- now, almost right away, right after that sentence, you started saying that you actually had not committed the tax crime you pled guilty to, correct?

Michael Cohen: No, sir.

Todd Blanche: Well, when did you start saying that?

Michael Cohen: I repeated what I had written as well with my attorney in the sentencing memo, that I take responsibility, but I did not believe that it was a charge that I should have been -- that a -- a crime that I should have been charged with. That's in the sentencing memo as well.

Todd Blanche: When you wrote a book called "Revenge," you described the tax charges as bogus, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And in that same book, you said the tax evasion charges were 100 percent inaccurate, correct?

Michael Cohen: I believe I should not have been charged, yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: So I didn't ask you whether you said you believed you should not have been charged, what I asked you is whether in your book you said the charges were 100 percent inaccurate?

Michael Cohen: I was referring to, again, the same thing.

Todd Blanche: But you said that, right?

Michael Cohen: I said that, yes.

Todd Blanche: In fact, in that book, you said: "Now allow me to give you the real facts. The DOJ charged the tax evasion. They are all 100 percent inaccurate and, most importantly, SDNY prosecutors knew it." Right?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And you felt and believe -- I believe you still do feel that you did not engage in tax fraud, but you had to plead guilty to protect your wife and family, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: You've also said on TikTok as recently as April 1st of this year, that the Federal investigation against you was the most corrupt prosecution in at least the last 100 years, correct?

Michael Cohen: I've said that, yes.

Todd Blanche: And then on CNN, very recently, March of last year, so March of 2023, you said that the lies by the Southern District of New York against me for tax evasion, I actually hope that all comes out?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection, your Honor. Can we approach for a moment?

Juan Merchan: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Judge, he is reading off a lot of documents that are not in evidence.

Todd Blanche: Okay.

Juan Merchan: Yes, he is reading from documents that are not evidence.

Todd Blanche: Do you recall on March 30th of last year, 2023, going on CNN Tonight?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: I want to show you what has been marked for identification as B52.

Todd Blanche: And I would ask that it just be shown to the witness, the parties and the Court.

Todd Blanche: And if we can go to Page 9 of that exhibit. Take a look at Page 9, and maybe if you can look about -- if we can blow up about a third of the way down.

Todd Blanche: So on that --

Todd Blanche: We can take that down. Thank you.

Todd Blanche: During that CNN interview that you just saw a transcript of, you said that you hoped the tax evasion charges would eventually all come out, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: That the lies by the Southern District of New York Prosecutors would eventually be exposed, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: Now, you testified that you provided a lot of documents to the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, correct?

Michael Cohen: They were part of the phone, yes.

Todd Blanche: Did you also provide any boxes of materials?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: Not necessarily in connection with the investigation, but you provided them materials, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And you received a subpoena from the defense in this case, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And in any of the materials that you -- have either provided to the defense or to the District Attorney, did you provide proof that you have been talking about, that there were documents to support the fact that there was no tax evasion?

Michael Cohen: I'm sorry, I don't understand your question.

Todd Blanche: Well, you say you want the truth to come out that the Prosecutors in the Southern District of New York were corrupt and knew it, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: Have you provided any materials to anybody suggesting that the charges that you pled guilty to were not appropriate?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Todd Blanche: So, in addition to the Prosecutors, you also believe that Judge Pauley is corrupt as well, correct?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: Overruled.

Michael Cohen: I have said that, yes.

Todd Blanche: And he's deceased, by the way?

Michael Cohen: He is.

Todd Blanche: And you believe that Judge Pauley was in on it, right?

Michael Cohen: I've said that, yes.

Todd Blanche: Well, that's a different question. You have said it, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: Do you believe that Judge Pauley was in on it?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Note: [Whereupon, at this time Principal Court Reporter Susan Pearce-Bates relieved Lisa Kramsky as the official court reporter.]

Todd Blanche: You called the Southern District of New York prosecutors and Judge Pauley fucking animals, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: But in addition to what we just talked about so, your podcast statements, your statements on TikTok and your statements to the pretrial services officer, you also testified under oath that you did not commit tax crimes that you plead guilty to before Judge Pauley, correct?

Michael Cohen: I stated, again, that I never -- that I don't dispute the facts of the case, but that I should not have been prosecuted. I have for the last six years, including in the sentencing memo, said the same thing, again, again. First time tax evader, never filing a late tax return, paying the taxes, all the money in Capital One Bank located at the base of the building I lived in, all the documents, all the bank records provided to my CPA and organized in three-ring tabulated books, which the FBI took, I don't believe that I should have been charged.

Michael Cohen: I should have been given the same opportunity as everybody else when you receive a letter from the IRS indicating that there is an issue with your taxes. I never received that. And I never had an opportunity to meet with an agent, with my lawyer or CPA, whomever, in order to keep this civil. It immediately, within that 48 hours, went criminal.

Todd Blanche: All right. So, let me ask my question again. All right?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: You testified under oath at a different trial that you did not commit the crimes that you had pled guilty to before Judge Pauley, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: That was at a trial at 60 Centre Street right across the street from here?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And you testified on October 24th and 25th of last year, 2023, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And not to spend too much time on it, you were placed under oath just like you are here?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: The Judge told you, you had to tell the truth, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And do you remember being asked a question about whether you have ever made any public statements concerning the legitimacy of your conviction and you said more than one, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And then you were asked why you did that. Do you remember testifying because there was no tax evasion, at best it could be characterized as a tax omission?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Todd Blanche: Do you remember testifying about, back in October 24th, about the legitimacy of your conviction?

Michael Cohen: As what I had just stated before.

Todd Blanche: Meaning that?

Michael Cohen: I should not have been charged with a tax crime.

Todd Blanche: You also talked in that trial -- you also answered questions under oath about the HELOC violation, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: You also said you should not have had to plead guilty to the HELOC violation either, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: Tell us why you think that.

Michael Cohen: Because while the statement on the document was not reflective, the HELOC, which stands for home equity line of credit, it is a nicer way of saying a line of credit based upon your home's equity, which really wouldn't sound right, I had more than ten times coverage. And it's not the first HELOC I have had on that property.

Michael Cohen: I have had a HELOC on that property for over ten years. I just moved it to First Republic Bank for a mortgage. And as the TD HELOC was expiring, I had asked Gary Farro, the banker, whether or not I can get a HELOC there. So, I did not believe that it was material and that's why I said that I did not believe I should have been charged with that crime as well.

Todd Blanche: Are you finished?

Michael Cohen: I am now, yes.

Todd Blanche: When you testified under oath and pled guilty that you knew at the time that your false statements on that application would be used as a decision by the bank, were you lying?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Overruled.

Michael Cohen: I took the global plea that was provided.

Todd Blanche: Sir, sir, please don't make a speech. It was a simple question.

Susan Hoffinger: Your Honor, objection.

Juan Merchan: Overruled. Please answer the question.

Todd Blanche: My question was, I wasn't looking for a global plea explanation. My question was a lot simpler than that. When you testified under oath in front Judge Pauley that you knew at the time that you filled out those forms that the information you provided was going to be used by the bank in making a decision about that HELOC, were you lying at the time you made those statements?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: And that's because of the explanation that you gave in this courtroom just a minute ago?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: So, do you remember on Tuesday when the prosecutor asked you about your testimony that I am talking about now, and the prosecutor said to you, that you answered questions in response to -- in response from President Trump's lawyer? Do you remember that?

Michael Cohen: I am sorry. Can you say that again?

Todd Blanche: When the prosecutor was asking about your testimony last October on Tuesday, do you remember those questions?

Michael Cohen: I remember they were asking me questions, yes.

Todd Blanche: I am not asking if you remember the questions from October.

Michael Cohen: That's way the question sounds --

Todd Blanche: I am asking if you remember the questions from Tuesday from Ms. Hoffinger?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: And she said to you that you answered questions that were put to you by President Trump's lawyers in October, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: But the questions that you just talked about, those were when you talked about the HELOC, and when you talked about the fact that there was no tax evasion, that was in response to questions from the Assistant Attorney General, correct?

Michael Cohen: I believe so, yes.

Todd Blanche: So it wasn't just President Trump's lawyers that asked you about whether you lied in front of Judge Pauley, the Assistant Attorney General asked you questions as well, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: Now, when President Trump's lawyers did start asking you questions, again, I am talking about questions at trial last October 24th and 25th, do you remember being asked whether when you told Judge Pauley that you were pleading guilty because you were guilty, do you remember being asked whether that was a lie, and you said, yes, that was a lie?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And you were asked again under oath last October whether you lied more than once in front of Judge Pauley and you said, yes?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And you believe you did lie more than once before Judge Pauley, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: You also answered a question, do you recall that the reason why you lied was because the stakes affected you personally, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: And you agreed?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: And so, when you said that last October, was that true?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: Meaning the reason you lied to a Federal Judge is because the stakes affected you personally, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: And there is no doubt that you know what perjury means, correct?

Michael Cohen: I know what perjury means.

Todd Blanche: Now, a few months after your guilty plea, I am sorry we are jumping around a little bit, a few months after your guilty pleas and sentencing, you testified in front of Congress on February 27, 2019, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And the very next day you testified in front of the Senate on February 28, is that right?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: And, again, you were put under oath like every other time, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: Same exact oath? As a matter of fact, the cover art for your Mea Culpa Podcast is a picture of you taking the oath, right?

Michael Cohen: That is correct.

Todd Blanche: And it was taking the oath at one of those hearings in February 2019, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: Now, when you testified in front of Congress in 2019, you testified that you confessed to your mistakes about taxes and other mistakes and plead guilty to that, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: Did you tell Congress, either the House or the Senate, that, actually, you had lied to Judge Pauley?

Michael Cohen: I did not.

Todd Blanche: So, on Tuesday you talked about omissions. Would you agree with me that by not telling Congress or the Senate that you had lied under oath, that you were omitting important information?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Overruled.

Michael Cohen: I don't believe I was asked the question.

Todd Blanche: Well, if we can go to, again, just for the witness, the parties and the Court, B-518. And there is a long back and forth when Congressmen ask you questions, they go on and on, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: Even more than I do. If we can go to page 36, excuse me. Sorry. Page 32, and then if you can read, Mr. Cohen, the bottom of page 32 and then we will turn the page and read in to page 33.

Michael Cohen: Mr. Jordan, I thank the gentleman --

Todd Blanche: I don't want you to read it aloud. Just read it to yourself. I should have been more clear.

Todd Blanche: In your answer, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: You say you said that you took responsibility and that you take responsibility, correct?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: And you said that you take responsibility for your mistake, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: You said you were remorseful and you are going to prison?

Michael Cohen: Unfortunately correct.

Todd Blanche: Again, I am not prolonging this, but when you say, remorseful, you are away from your family, away from your children, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: But what you didn't say in that answer was that as part of accepting responsibility you had actually lied under oath, right?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Todd Blanche: Well, did you say at any point in your testimony before Congress on either February 27th or February 28th, what you testified to last October, that you actually lied to Judge Pauley?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Todd Blanche: You repeatedly said to Congressmen, Senators under oath over the course of two days that you had accepted responsibility for your conduct, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct, and that I was going to prison as a result.

Todd Blanche: And that you were going to prison as a result, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: But do you agree with me that lying under oath is not accepting responsibility?

Michael Cohen: Can you clarify your question?

Todd Blanche: Do you agree with me that when you plead guilty to a crime and you are lying, that's not accepting responsibility for your conduct, is it?

Michael Cohen: I accepted responsibility, and I was suffering the consequences as a result.

Todd Blanche: So, let me ask the question again, putting aside the fact that you are testifying today that you accepted responsibility, my question is different. When you plead guilty one of the things that you get, one of the benefits you get of pleading guilty is a little bit of time off your sentence because you accepted your responsibility, correct?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: So when you were sentenced in December the Judge took into account that you had accepted responsibility for your crimes, correct?

Michael Cohen: I don't know what the Judge made his determination on.

Todd Blanche: Well, you know that under the guidelines calculation you get time off for accepting responsibility, correct?

Michael Cohen: You do. You get a reduction.

Todd Blanche: And you got that reduction for accepting responsibility, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: By pleading guilty, correct?

Michael Cohen: I plead guilty.

Todd Blanche: And for timeliness of your guilty pleas, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: So, my question is, again, when you got the credit at sentencing for accepting responsibility you got that credit even though you lied, you lied to the Judge when you pled guilty?

Michael Cohen: Again, I don't know how Judge Pauley made his determination. Judges, as you know, have a wide range of discretion over guidelines. I have seen people with me while I was in Otisville who had far greater, longer tax evasion issues who had a year and a day. So, I don't know Judge Pauley's determination.

Todd Blanche: Do you think Judge Pauley would have liked to know that you had lied to him?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: Overruled. He can answer.

Michael Cohen: I don't know what Judge Pauley would have thought.

Todd Blanche: Your testimony is you don't know whether Judge Pauley would want to know that you had lied to him?

Michael Cohen: I am certain that he would have.

Todd Blanche: And if he had known that, that would have been something he would have taken into account at sentencing, correct?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Todd Blanche: Well, if you had told him in your sentencing submission, which you talked about a lot, by the way, I lied to you. What do you -- what's your understanding from all the folks you met at Otisville, and everything you been through, what's your understanding of what would happen if you put that in your sentencing submission?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Todd Blanche: The reality is, and the truth is, there was nothing in your sentencing submission about the fact that you had lied under oath, correct?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Overruled.

Michael Cohen: No. It was not in, but the sentencing came, obviously, before. The sentencing memo was put in before the sentence.

Todd Blanche: Does that matter?

Michael Cohen: No.

Todd Blanche: You also were asked at sentencing whether you had reviewed the sentencing submission and you said you had, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And you had an opportunity to make a statement, and you made a statement, correct?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Todd Blanche: And your lawyer made arguments, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And your lawyer was asking for a sentence of time served, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: But you will agree with me that neither you nor your lawyer told Judge Pauley that you had lied to him, correct?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: So you, by the way, you blamed a lot of people over the years for the conduct that you were convicted of, correct?

Michael Cohen: I blamed people, yes.

Todd Blanche: You blamed your accountant, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And at times you blamed the bank even?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: You blamed, as we talked about, the Federal prosecutors, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: You blamed the Judge?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: You blamed President Trump?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: Now, do you have any doubt in your mind that the outcome of this trial will affect you personally?

Michael Cohen: Can you -- could you clarify your question?

Todd Blanche: Does the outcome of this trial affect you personally?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: Did you or your lawyers, as part of your sentencing submission, or what you said at sentencing, say anything to Judge Pauley about the fact that you had felt pressured and threatened by the Government to make a quick decision on your guilty plea?

Michael Cohen: Did not.

Todd Blanche: So, by the way, your wife had nothing to do with the leasing arrangement that you talked about with Mr. Freidman, did she?

Michael Cohen: Some of the medallions, corporations, were in her name.

Todd Blanche: And when you -- when you received monthly payments, were the checks made to both you and your wife or just you or who were the checks made to?

Michael Cohen: The corporation names.

Todd Blanche: What was the corporation's name?

Michael Cohen: Which one. There were 16 corporations.

Todd Blanche: So you had 16 corporations to collect the lease fees for your medallions.

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: By the way, there is nothing illegal or improper about having 16 LLCs, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: It's actually smart business?

Michael Cohen: It's actually standard in the industry.

Todd Blanche: And good business practice, correct, standard in the industry?

Michael Cohen: In the Taxi and Limousine Commission, when you have what's called a Mini Fleet Corporation, that's two medallions or more, you need to have them in a corporation, as opposed to an individual medallion. So just as an FYI, the A through F medallions that you see, those are individuals. The other ones are generally corporations.

Todd Blanche: Understood. Thank you.

Michael Cohen: You're welcome.

Todd Blanche: Now, jumping forward to -- still talking about the HELOC loan, you testified that -- so, in February of 2016, you get this HELOC loan from the bank, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And that's the paperwork that you pled guilty to being false -- providing false information, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: But when you opened that HELOC, line of credit, it had nothing to do with Ms. Daniels, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: So we are fast forwarding now to October, and I believe your testimony was that one of the reasons why you decide to use the HELOC was because you could hide it from your wife, correct?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: And while her name was on the HELOC loan, your testimony is that it was paperless so, you thought that you could move the money into the HELOC, pay Ms. Daniels and your wife would not know?

Michael Cohen: Move the money out of the HELOC into the new company, what became Essential Consultants, and, yes, she would not know because it was paperless.

Todd Blanche: Well, you are skipping a step, right? You would move the money from the -- let's say you have, basically, a HELOC with no balance, you are allowed to put money on it. So apply 131,000 to your new LLC from the HELOC, and then you would owe on your line of credit $131,000 right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And you were able to hide that from your wife because you have paperless statements or what have you, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And you didn't tell your wife -- well, when did you tell your wife about the HELOC?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: Overruled. You can answer.

Michael Cohen: I am sorry. The question again?

Todd Blanche: You testified that you didn't tell your wife --

Susan Hoffinger: May we approach?

Juan Merchan: Yes.

Note: [Discussion is held at sidebar, on the record.]

Susan Hoffinger: Judge, I believe there is a marital privilege. He is asking what he told the wife and he is asking about underlying transactions. I don't think it's admissible.

Todd Blanche: On direct examination as evidence of the crime charged, this witness testified that one of the reasons why he did this was to keep it from his wife so, if anything, there is a crime fraud exception that talks about --

Juan Merchan: It wasn't to keep it from his wife. It was to protect his wife.

Todd Blanche: He testified it was to keep it from his wife. She is --

Susan Hoffinger: I never asked about communications with his wife. I asked why he used the HELOC.

Juan Merchan: There is a privilege here. It is privileged.

Note: [Discussion at sidebar concluded, and the following occurred in open court.]

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Note: [Continued direct examination by Todd Blanche.]

Todd Blanche: Without talking about any communications that you had with your wife, do you know whether your wife ever found out about what you did with the HELOC and the $131,000?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Todd Blanche: You, by the way, you remember on March 9, 2018, Ms. Daniels' lawyer, Michael Avenatti, put out a public statement regarding the fact that you had paid $130,000 from the HELOC? Do you remember that?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And you issued your own statement at the time and you said, in part, the funds were taken from my home equity line and transferred internally to my LLC account in the same bank, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And you testified on Monday, and just a few minutes ago, that you decided to do it this way, it was quick, you could move the money quickly and because you wanted to conceal it from your wife, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And you separately said on your podcast that your wife had no knowledge of the HELOC prior to March 2018, correct?

Michael Cohen: Not that she didn't have knowledge of the HELOC, that she didn't have knowledge of the transaction.

Todd Blanche: That's a fair correction. So, of course, she knew that you had a HELOC. She didn't have knowledge of what you testified about, that you moved $131,000, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: Now, do you know that just two days later so, Mr. Avenatti releases that statement on March 9th, Mr. Cohen?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: And you issued a statement the same day, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And then two days later, you know that you deleted all the text messages that you had with your wife on March 11th?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: Overruled. You can answer.

Michael Cohen: I am not -- I am not aware of that.

Todd Blanche: Well, did you have a practice of communication -- deleting communications, generally, around that time, so March of 2018?

Michael Cohen: I didn't have a specific practice of that, no.

Todd Blanche: But were there certain folks that you communicated with over either Signal, Dust or WhatsApp that you encouraged them to delete your communications with them?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: Which people?

Michael Cohen: On Signal it actually does it automatically. So, people like David Pecker.

Todd Blanche: But did you have a habit of asking, for example, your wife to delete her communications?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Todd Blanche: Well, do you know someone named Shirlene Sachs?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Todd Blanche: Do you recall asking Ms. Sachs to delete all of her communications with you and that you would do the same?

Michael Cohen: I don't recall that specifically.

Todd Blanche: So, if we can show the witness, the Court and the parties, what's been marked for identification as B 216.

Todd Blanche: Can you just take a look and see if this refreshes your recollection?

Todd Blanche: We can go to the next pages, and the next page. The next page. And then if we can skip ahead to page 22 of this exhibit. And if you see the second entry, and the first entry. We can take that down.

Todd Blanche: Does that refresh your recollection that you asked Ms. Sachs to delete all of your communications?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: So, I want to talk now about your testimony to Congress about whether you ever requested a pardon, okay?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: On that February 27, 2019, House Committee Hearing you gave a statement under oath that you never asked for, nor would you ever accept a pardon from President Trump, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And that was false, correct?

Michael Cohen: No, sir.

Todd Blanche: Why was that not false?

Michael Cohen: I never asked for it. I spoke to my attorney about it because we had seen on television President Trump talking about, potentially, pre-pardoning everybody and putting an end to this, what I deemed to be a nightmare. So, I reached out to my attorney to ask him whether or not this is legitimate.

Todd Blanche: So, when you were asked -- when you provided testimony -- and, again, same thing happened on that occasion, you had to prepare remarks that you provided the committee and then you read into the record, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And both of those prepared remarks in writing and also when you said it in the record under oath you said, and I have never asked for, nor would I accept a pardon from President Trump, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: Now, that was on February 27th. Do you remember about ten days later you were deposed in the House Oversight Committee?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And do you remember being asked the same question about accepting a pardon and you saying that you directed your lawyer to explore the possibility because you were a hundred percent open to accepting it?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And the lawyer -- there were a couple of lawyers that you were talking about, right? One was Mr. Ryan, who worked -- who was your lawyer who worked with a law firm called McDermott, Will and Emery?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: And you spoke with her here named, Robert Costello about that same issue, about exploring the possibility of a pardon, correct?

Michael Cohen: I spoke to Mr. Costello about that as well.

Todd Blanche: And in that deposition so, not the sworn testimony on February 27th, but in that deposition, you said that, you directed your lawyers to explore the possibility of a pardon because the possibility was constantly being dangled in your face, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: So, do you remember that right after you gave that answer, the person who was questioning you asked you to reconcile your testimony ten days earlier saying you never asked for, nor would you ever accept a pardon and your testimony at that deposition? Do you remember a question about how could you reconcile these two statements?

Michael Cohen: I don't.

Todd Blanche: So, if we go to -- well, let me see if I can refresh your recollection.

Todd Blanche: If we can go to what has been marked for identification as B-80, just for the parties and the witness. If we can go to the first page, that is the House Subcommittee deposition from March 6th, and now, if we can jump ahead to page 116.

Todd Blanche: And if you can look at the part where you are answering questions of Mr. Ratcliff about the statement regarding the pardon. So, let me know when you have had a chance to read that?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: So today you testified just a few minutes ago that when you said you never asked for, nor would you accept a pardon from President Trump, you said you never did, you just directed your lawyers to do that, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: But when you were asked in 2019 to explain the disparity, you said that you were talking about the -- you were talking about the present tense, you weren't talking about the past tense when you were writing and stating that statement, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: So which one is it? Is it that you were talking in the present sense when you testified that you never asked for, nor would you ever accept a pardon from President Trump, were you talking about the present sense, like you testified under oath ten days later, or were you meaning that you never personally asked for one like you testified here today?

Michael Cohen: That I personally.

Todd Blanche: So when you testified under oath at the deposition on February -- excuse me, on March 6th, that you were talking about the present tense, that was not true?

Michael Cohen: No. It was the present tense, that I -- I was not asking for it.

Todd Blanche: So, you are -- so, is your testimony that when you said, I have never asked for, nor would I accept a pardon from President Trump, when you said that you were talking in the present sense?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: But were you also -- did you also mean that you didn't personally ask for it, you had your lawyers ask for it?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir, to explore it. Because, again, as I wrote, or as I stated, it was being dangled.

Todd Blanche: But maybe I am not being clear with my question. I will try to be clearer. Is it that you, when you made that statement, you were speaking in the present sense, and so, it was a truthful statement, or did you mean I wasn't talking about myself, I was talking about my lawyers?

Michael Cohen: In the present sense.

Todd Blanche: So, it has nothing to do with whether you directed your lawyers. You did direct your lawyers to explore the possibility of a pardon, correct?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Todd Blanche: And when you read a statement that says that you would never accept a pardon, but you directed your lawyers to explore the possibility, that's not a true statement, is it?

Michael Cohen: At that present moment it was true. I wanted this nightmare to end. And so, with it being dangled, seeing it on television, I asked them, is this really something that they are talking about, can you find out.

Todd Blanche: And what I am trying to understand is, given what you just said happened, what you wrote and then later said after being put under oath, that you never did that?

Michael Cohen: I am sorry. Can you repeat that.

Todd Blanche: You just gave a story that you wanted the nightmare to end, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And you had been hearing on television that they were dangling pardons. So, you directed your lawyer, hey, find out if I can get a pardon. I want this nightmare to end, right?

Michael Cohen: Not if I can get a pardon. If the President was going to be doing these pre-pardons.

Todd Blanche: But you -- you testified that you were 100 percent open to accepting it, anything to end this, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And so -- and you did that with a couple of your lawyers, Mr. Ryan and Mr. Costello, correct?

Michael Cohen: Mr. Costello was never my lawyer.

Todd Blanche: Well, you asked Mr. Costello, putting aside whether he was your lawyer, you asked Mr. Costello to reach out to people in the administration, including Mr. Giuliani, about the possibility of a pardon?

Michael Cohen: We spoke about it.

Todd Blanche: And as part of your conversation with him, you asked him to reach out to Mr. Giuliani and explore it, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And so, when you testified under oath less than one year later, February, on February 27th, 2019, that you never asked for, nor would you ever accept a pardon, that was a lie, wasn't it?

Michael Cohen: At the time it was accurate.

Todd Blanche: Well, the very next day -- so, again, February 27th, you say, I would never ask for a pardon. March 6th, you say, yes, I would. I would direct my lawyer to find out about a pardon. And you --

Susan Hoffinger: Objection, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Todd Blanche: The very next day, after all of that happened, your lawyer issued a statement, a public statement, that admitted that you had actually directed your lawyer, your attorneys at the time to explore the possibilities of a pardon, right?

Michael Cohen: I just stated that, yes.

Todd Blanche: And they did that to correct the record from your testimony in front of Congress, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: As a matter of fact, another one of your lawyers, Michael Monico, actually sent a letter to the Committee correcting your comment, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: But your testimony today is that your comment was true?

Michael Cohen: The conversation was confusing for me at the time and so we corrected the record.

Todd Blanche: The conversation? What conversation, sir?

Michael Cohen: The testimony.

Todd Blanche: Sir, this wasn't a confusing conversation. This was a pre-written statement by you that you then read into the record when the testimony started, correct?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Overruled.

Michael Cohen: I am sorry. One more time.

Todd Blanche: You said that the conversation was confusing, but, correct me if I am wrong, that statement was made in writing as a prepared statement, and then you read it into the record as part of your opening statement after being sworn under oath, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct. I was referring to what you just showed me, which was the -- that's why I am saying it was confusing. I thought you were referring to the comments that I just made. And, yes, the statement, we corrected the statement.

Todd Blanche: So, your lawyers corrected the statement because it wasn't true when you made it?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: So, after the FBI searched your house and your hotel and your office, you met with a bunch of lawyers, right?

Michael Cohen: I had one lawyer.

Todd Blanche: Well, you met with several lawyers, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: Ultimately, you hired Guy Petrillo to be your lawyer?

Michael Cohen: Correct. Correct.

Todd Blanche: And you testified on Tuesday that you met with Mr. Costello that time as well?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: And you communicated with him multiple times on the phone?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And over text?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: The first time you met Mr. Costello was actually in Lowes Regency where your family was staying, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And you met him and Jeff Citron, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And you knew Mr. Citron from something that has nothing to do with this, right?

Michael Cohen: Sterling National Bank.

Todd Blanche: And the reason why you met with Mr. Costello was to talk about whether you might hire him, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct. He was referred to me by Jeffery Citron.

Todd Blanche: And you understood at the time, I believe you testified on Tuesday, that Mr. Costello had a good relationship with Mr. Giuliani, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And he told you that?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And at that time Mr. Giuliani wasn't representing President Trump, but he started representing him very closely thereafter, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And you talked to Mr. Costello about your options, right?

Michael Cohen: Can you clarify, options?

Todd Blanche: Sure. You talked to him about what you should do, what your next steps would be given the FBI had just raided your office, home, hotel and safe deposit box?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And one of the things you talked about was cooperation, correct?

Michael Cohen: I don't recall that, no, sir.

Todd Blanche: So, you don't recall Mr. Costello telling you that one of the things that you could do was cooperate against President Trump, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: You don't think he said that or you just don't recall?

Michael Cohen: I don't recall.

Todd Blanche: Well, do you remember telling him that you had nothing on President Trump and could not cooperate?

Michael Cohen: No, sir.

Todd Blanche: Do you just not remember or are you sure you did not say it?

Michael Cohen: I do not recall.

Juan Merchan: Mr. Blanche, why don't we take our morning break.

Todd Blanche: Yes, Judge.

Juan Merchan: Jurors, lets take our break. I will ask you during this break to please let the Sergeant know if you are unable to work next Wednesday, okay. Thank you. I will see you in about 15 minutes.

Note: [The jury exited the courtroom and the following occurred.]

Juan Merchan: You may be seated.

Note: [Recess is taken.]

Sergeant: All rise. Part 59 is back in session.

Matthew Colangelo: Your Honor, one application from the People regarding the cross conducted. Mr. Blanche asked a series of questions of the witness regarding disclosure of the indictment while the indictment in this case was still under seal on March 31st. We are concerned that that leaves a misleading impression with the jury because, as the Court knows, the fact that the indictment was unsealed by Order of this Court on the evening of March 30th, and there was a series of questions whether the indictment was still under seal on March 31st and later.

Matthew Colangelo: So, we request that the Court takes judicial notice of the fact that the indictment was unsealed on the evening of March 30th and give a curative instruction to the jury of that fact.

Juan Merchan: Mr. Blanche.

Todd Blanche: Your Honor, there was sustained objections to the fact that Detective Rosenberg told Mr. Cohen before the matter was unsealed that, it is done, and that was sustained, and the exhibit is not in evidence. And there was a series of interviews that were done by this witness that he testified about before and after that date.

Todd Blanche: And so, to the extent that the Court either on redirect or even on cross, I can elicit the fact that the indictment was unsealed on a particular day is fine. I don't think a formal curative instruction about a couple of questions is necessary.

Matthew Colangelo: I am looking at the real-time transcript, your Honor, so this may not be perfectly accurate, but Mr. Blanche asked a series of questions: Do you recall on March 31st going on TV with a reporter named, Joy Reid? Yes, sir. Question: And, again, this is Friday, March 31st, so it's when the indictment is still under seal?

Matthew Colangelo: Correct. That clearly left the impression with the jury that there was something improper about the status of the -- his understanding of the indictment. And as the Court knows, the fact that the indictment was unsealed the day before, it is perfectly appropriate for the jury to be advised of that.

Juan Merchan: I think the jury should be advised. The question is how. What is the best way to do that?

Todd Blanche: I can -- well, I guess two options in my mind, better than the Court giving an instruction, I can just lead him and tell him and he will say, yes, or on redirect the People can do that and make it clear. I don't disagree that there shouldn't be confusion on that type of issue.

Juan Merchan: Why don't we see if you are able to address it. If you are unable to address it properly, the People can do it on their redirect. I don't think it requires an instruction from the bench.

Matthew Colangelo: Our only concern is this was an Order of the Court. We don't know if the witness was aware of the Court unsealing the indictment because it was the Court's own order. We think it is appropriate for the curative instruction to come from to you. It can be done quickly at the end of this proceeding after this witness.

Matthew Colangelo: And because the questions were misleading, your Honor, we think it's important that the Court correct it.

Juan Merchan: All right. Why don't you let him to try to clean it up? In the meantime, you can draft a curative instruction to come from the bench. I will review it and see if I should give it. The jurors indicated that they cannot work next Wednesday. So, that's off the table. Let's get the witness, please.

Lieutenant: Witness entering.

Note: [Whereupon, the witness entered the courtroom and was properly seated.]

Juan Merchan: Let's get the jury, please.

Lieutenant: All rise. The jury is entering the courtroom.

Note: [Whereupon, the jurors entered the courtroom and were properly seated.]

Juan Merchan: Please be seated.

Court Clerk: Case on trial continued. All jurors are present and properly seated.

Juan Merchan: Jurors, I am informed that you are unable to work next Wednesday. Thank you for considering that. Mr. Blanche.

Note: [Continued direct examination by Todd Blanche.]

Todd Blanche: So, Mr. Cohen, before the break, well -- so, you testified earlier this morning you were never offered a Cooperation Agreement with the Southern District of New York, correct?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: Same thing with the Special Counsel, with Mueller, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: The same thing, you are not a cooperating witness in this case either?

Michael Cohen: No, sir.

Todd Blanche: The Attorney General, the trial that you testified about before the break, you were just a witness in that case as well? You were not a cooperating witness, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: But is it fair to say that one of the reasons that you accepted responsibility and pled guilty in August and then again in November was because you wanted to explore cooperation, correct?

Michael Cohen: Can you clarify that?

Todd Blanche: Well, did you try to cooperate -- not did you try to cooperate. Did you meet with the Special Counsel in between the first meeting on August 7th and your sentencing?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Todd Blanche: And on several occasions?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And at those meetings, at least some of them, prosecutors from the Southern District of New York were there as well?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: So, just to help the jury to understand that, there are two separate prosecutors, Special Counsel just from DC, that was Robert Mueller, and then the Southern District of New York prosecutors, which are here in Manhattan, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And you were meeting with them and providing information, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: But, ultimately, that effort did not result in a Cooperation Agreement, correct?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: And since your sentencing in December, you continued to meet with the Special Counsel and Southern District of New York prosecutors, occasionally, until you showed up to serve your sentence for at least a little bit of time after your sentence, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And then we talked about yesterday, once you were at Otisville you started meeting with the representatives from the Manhattan District Attorney's Office. So that was in August, correct, of 2018?

Michael Cohen: [Nodding affirmatively.]

Todd Blanche: And then, since you have been released from prison, technically, although a lot of that was spent on home confinement because of COVID, you have made several attempts to be released from your supervised release early, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And is it your understanding that there are all kinds of factors that go into that decision, but, ultimately, the Judge can decide whether to grant that, whether to release you early, correct?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained. Please clarify which Judge we are talking about.

Todd Blanche: So Judge Pauley passed away?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: And your Federal case was assigned to a new Judge?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And so, when you made these motions in Federal Court, that was made in Federal Court to the new Judge, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And you tried that on multiple occasions, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: You first tried that, to be released from supervised release about six months or so after it started, is that right?

Michael Cohen: No, sir.

Todd Blanche: How long after?

Michael Cohen: It was some months after, but it was not for supervised release, it was for home confinement.

Todd Blanche: Right. You testified about that yesterday. Before you were released from prison, you tried to have your prison sentence reduced as well, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct. Pursuant to the Rule 35.

Todd Blanche: Pursuant to Rule 35, which is made within one year of your sentencing and a Judge under certain circumstances can reduce your sentence, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And then that didn't result in a lower sentence, did it?

Michael Cohen: No, sir.

Todd Blanche: And then when your sentence ultimately expired, you then went from being sentenced to being on probation or supervised release, right?

Michael Cohen: Supervised release.

Todd Blanche: And you are still on supervised release today?

Michael Cohen: I am.

Todd Blanche: After you started supervised release, you have made several efforts to have your supervised release terminated early, is that right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: How many occasions?

Michael Cohen: Three.

Todd Blanche: Could it be four?

Michael Cohen: It could be four.

Todd Blanche: And none of those have been successful, right?

Michael Cohen: No, sir.

Todd Blanche: Now, in all four of those, one of the reasons stated to ask the Judge to release you on early supervised release was your ongoing cooperation with law enforcement, right?

Michael Cohen: In conjunction with the first three included the work credits, as well as the program credits received at Otisville.

Todd Blanche: So one of the reasons were the overall circumstances of your sentence, right? That you believed you were entitled to credits. You believed the calculation was inaccurate, but also in the Judge's discretion you wanted the Judge to release you early because of your cooperation, right?

Michael Cohen: For both of those reasons, yes.

Todd Blanche: But you never, this whole time, all the meetings, you were never offered a Cooperation Agreement and you were never a cooperating witness, correct?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: So I want to go back to your testimony last October in a different trial, October 24th and 25th, when you were under oath and answering questions, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And you were asked questions about your cooperation and you said that you did cooperate with the Government, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And then you were asked a question about whether you received a 5K1 or substantial assistance letter from the Government, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: Can you tell the jury what a 5K1 is?

Michael Cohen: It is a Cooperation Agreement with the Government.

Todd Blanche: The Federal Government?

Michael Cohen: The Federal Government.

Todd Blanche: It is a motion, a 5K1 Motion, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And if the motion is made by the Government, the Federal Government, it allows the Judge to give you a lower sentence, right?

Michael Cohen: Additional benefit, yes.

Todd Blanche: And you get that, potentially, if you are a cooperating witness?

Michael Cohen: You have to be a cooperating witness.

Todd Blanche: And you were never offered a Cooperation Agreement, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And in response to that question, and on October 24th, the question was whether you received a 5K1 or substantial assistance letter, you said you refused such a letter, correct? Do you remember saying that?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Todd Blanche: That's not true, is it?

Michael Cohen: It's true.

Todd Blanche: So all of your efforts of cooperation, the Rule 35 Motion and every time you asked for early termination of supervised release because you are a cooperating witness, your testimony is that you refused a 5K1 letter is truthful?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Overruled.

Michael Cohen: Yes, it's truthful. The 5K1 concept was given to Guy Petrillo, my lawyer, that was after I had pled, after the 48 hours that I was given to plead. And so, I turned it around and I said, I am not interested. So let's not even talk about it.

Todd Blanche: Who did you say that to?

Michael Cohen: Guy Petrillo, my lawyer.

Todd Blanche: So you are saying that was early on, right after you plead guilty like in August?

Michael Cohen: If I plead guilty, yes. The concept came up, and I wasn't interested, and I said don't even bring it up.

Todd Blanche: And the concept you are talking about is the acceptance of an offer of a Cooperation Agreement?

Michael Cohen: The 5K1.

Todd Blanche: But you get a 5K1 if you sign a Cooperation Agreement?

Michael Cohen: Which I did not.

Todd Blanche: Which was never offered to you, correct?

Michael Cohen: It was never -- it was never offered to me. As expressed to Mr. Petrillo, I wouldn't accept one.

Todd Blanche: So, all right. Let's talk about your desire to work at the White House. You testified on Monday, but also on Tuesday, that you were -- that you had conversations with a lot of people about working with President Trump in the White House, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And I believe you testified that you were never offered the role of Chief of Staff, and while you agreed that that role maybe wasn't right for you, you wish you would have been, at least, considered, is that right?

Michael Cohen: I would have liked to be considered for ego purposes.

Todd Blanche: You also testified that you were offered the role of Assistant General Counsel at some point, correct?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: That could have been -- you would have been a White House employee in the White House General Counsel's Office, right?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: Now, as part of your sentencing in December, the Southern District of New York wrote in their sentencing --

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Todd Blanche: Do you recall -- do you recall arguments being made at sentencing that you had wanted a role in the White House?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Please approach.

Note: [Discussion is held at sidebar, on the record.]

Juan Merchan: When you say, arguments being made, what are you referring to?

Todd Blanche: So, the Southern District in their sentencing submission said that there were text messages. The reason why I am laying that foundation is because he then testifies about that in front of Congress. So, Congress says -- at Congress he is asked a question, Southern District said you wanted a job in the White House?

Todd Blanche: And he answers that question and the answer was a lie.

Susan Hoffinger: Your Honor, you already precluded the Southern District's opinions one way or another as being inadmissible in this case. So, I guess I don't know what the relevance is. I guess if he wants to ask if he wanted to work in the White Hous, You can ask him that, but not what the arguments were.

Juan Merchan: Right. Do you feel like that is an inconsistent statement?

Todd Blanche: I can go right to the testimony and ask him to say, yes or no, about Southern District.

Juan Merchan: Why don't you skip whatever everybody was arguing or saying and just get to the question? All right?

Todd Blanche: All right.

Note: [Discussion at sidebar concluded, and the following occurred in open court.]

Note: [Continued cross examination by Todd Blanche.]

Todd Blanche: So, I want to direct your attention again to that February 27th, 2019, testimony from the House Sub-committee. We talked a lot about that today, okay?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: Do you remember being asked a question about your desire to work in the White House? Do you remember questions about that?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: And as part of the questions, the questioner said -- asked about certain text messages that they had reviewed that suggested you wanted a job in the White House, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And they had reviewed those from a sentencing submission from December, correct?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Todd Blanche: So, do you remember -- do you remember telling Congress that it was a lie, that you did not want to go to the White House? Do you remember saying that to Congress?

Michael Cohen: I remember telling Congress I did not want to work in the White House.

Todd Blanche: Well, do you remember saying, what you testified to on Tuesday is that you didn't want to go to the White House?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: And that you wanted to continue in the role as President Trump's personal attorney, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And you testified that every President had one, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And you even testified about certain matters that you handled for President Trump as his personal attorney while he was President, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: But you definitively stated under oath that you did not want, when asked the question about whether you wanted to work in the White House, you said no, sir, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: You testified that you did not want to go to the White House, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And that you were offered jobs in the White House, right?

Michael Cohen: I was offered a role, yes.

Todd Blanche: You also testified that you were present when President Trump reamed out Mr. Priebus because you hadn't taken a job that you were offered, right? And that job was a job we talked about a minute ago in the White House Counsel's Office?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: You weren't working for Don McGahn, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: But the truth is, Mr. Cohen, you really wanted to work in the White House, correct?

Michael Cohen: No, sir.

Todd Blanche: You didn't simply indulge friends and family about working in the White House like you testified about, you really wanted to work in the White House, correct?

Michael Cohen: Again, no, sir.

Todd Blanche: You hoped that you would be named the White House Chief of Staff, not just be considered, but be named the White House Chief of Staff, correct?

Michael Cohen: No, sir.

Todd Blanche: Are you familiar with somebody named Spencer Zwick?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir. I know Spencer Zwick.

Todd Blanche: Who is that?

Michael Cohen: He was the fundraiser for Mitt Romney.

Todd Blanche: And was that when Mr. Romney was running for President?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: Do you recall having a conversation with Mr. Zwick where he asked you whether you wanted to be Attorney General Cohen or Chief of Staff, and you answered Chief? Do you recall that?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And that was -- that was still during the campaign, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And then after President Trump was elected in November, he congratulated you, and he said, Chief of Staff. And you said, that would be nice, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: Are you familiar with somebody named Rita Veygman?

Michael Cohen: I am.

Todd Blanche: Who is that?

Michael Cohen: It's a friend, family friend.

Todd Blanche: She is a fashion executive in New York?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir. Actually, Florida, but, yes, she relocated.

Todd Blanche: And do you recall on November 9th, so right after the election, you told her that she was going to come to the White House with you to be your Assistant, Assistant to the Chief of Staff? Do you remember saying that?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: And then a few days later, November 12, so still November 2016, you had a series of communications with a family member, with your daughter, where you discussed whether you still had a chance at the Chief of Staff position, right?

Michael Cohen: Amongst other texts, yes.

Todd Blanche: Pardon me?

Michael Cohen: Amongst other text messages, yes.

Todd Blanche: And your daughter actually alerted you to the fact that she read that there was a consideration that Mr. Priebus would be Chief of Staff. And you said he is pushing like a mad man, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And then there was a continued conversation about whether you still had a chance to be Chief of Staff, and you said there was still many opportunities, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes. I think I also used the word, hybrid.

Todd Blanche: And in that text exchange you used the word, hybrid?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: Let's take a look at -- just the witness, parties and the Court.

Susan Hoffinger: It's in evidence.

Juan Merchan: We can show it to the people.

Todd Blanche: And you talked about --

Todd Blanche: We will move on. We don't need to show that. You can take the exhibit down.

Todd Blanche: You talked about, with your daughter, as you testified on Tuesday, about other opportunities in the White House besides Chief of Staff, correct?

Michael Cohen: Amongst other things, yes.

Todd Blanche: Are you familiar with somebody named Kedar Massenburg?

Michael Cohen: Yes, I am.

Todd Blanche: Who is that?

Michael Cohen: He is a friend of mine, a former CEO of Motown Records.

Todd Blanche: He is like a record producer?

Michael Cohen: Former CEO of Motown, yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: The same day that you spoke to your daughter about Mr. Priebus being named Chief of Staff, you had a communication with Mr. Massenburg where you, again, discussed whether you would be Chief of Staff, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And you told him at that point you just don't know, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And then the next day -- so, do you recall on or around November 13th, President Trump picked Mr. Priebus to be the Chief of Staff, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: You told your daughter you were disappointed?

Michael Cohen: That I wasn't considered, yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And as you testified on Tuesday, you said that President Trump needed an insider and that's why you weren't selected, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: And your daughter was frustrated, at least she appeared frustrated over texts, that President Trump didn't talk to you about it before he picked Mr. Priebus, right?

Michael Cohen: I don't know if I would characterize it as frustrated, as much as disappointed.

Todd Blanche: There were discussions around that same time about who would be President Trump's Attorney General, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: And you told people you would like to be Attorney General, correct?

Michael Cohen: I don't recall that.

Todd Blanche: You don't recall telling Keith Davidson that you wanted to be Attorney General?

Michael Cohen: I don't recall if I told him that or he asked me, what about you being Attorney General?

Todd Blanche: So you recall him asking that or you just don't recall at all?

Michael Cohen: I don't recall him asking that, no. And I don't recall me telling him that's what I wanted.

Todd Blanche: And then, eventually, there was a discussion about working in the White House Counsel's Office, correct?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: You wanted to be named Special Counsel to President Trump, which was the same title that you had had for nine and a half years, correct?

Michael Cohen: No, sir. It was Personal Attorney to President Donald J. Trump.

Note: [Whereupon, Principal Court Reporter Susan Pearce-Bates was relieved by Senior Court Reporter Theresa Magniccari.]

Note: [Whereupon, the following proceedings were continued from the following page.]

Note: [Continued cross examination by Todd Blanche.]

Todd Blanche: That's what you eventually were, but I am talking about in November 2016, did you and your daughter have a conversation where you said that you're going to ask to be Special Counsel to the President?

Michael Cohen: Yes, but I was referring to Personal Attorney to the President.

Todd Blanche: Well, you talked about how, if you had that job, the pay would be very low because you would be working in the White House, correct?

Michael Cohen: No, I think that was for a different job.

Todd Blanche: What job was that for?

Michael Cohen: That was supposed to be Assistant White House General Counsel.

Todd Blanche: So your testimony is, that when you said you want to be Special Counsel to the President, you were talking about the job you ultimately were awarded, to be his Personal Attorney?

Michael Cohen: No, sir.

Todd Blanche: When you were talking -- when you had this intense exchange about being Special Counsel to the President, that would be you working in the White House as the Special Counsel, correct?

Michael Cohen: If there was a role such as that, yes.

Todd Blanche: You told your daughter that President Trump told his new Chief of Staff that he wanted you to be Special Counsel to the President, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And you told your daughter that would be great, right?

Michael Cohen: I am sorry. I don't think your are characterizing this correctly at all. My conversations with my daughter was I wanted a hybrid position, one where I would still have access to President Trump, but not be a White House employee. That was what I had been asking for and the conversation with my daughter.

Todd Blanche: In that conversation I believe we were both talking about, didn't you say that President Trump was very complimentary to you but that he couldn't come up with a title. That was what I had been asking for and that was the conversation with my daughter.

Todd Blanche: In the conversation I believe you were both talking about, didn't you say that President Trump was very complimentary to you but that he couldn't come up with a title, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: Well, you actually spoke with President Trump about that, didn't you?

Michael Cohen: No, sir. What I had spoken Mr. Trump, President Elect Trump at the time was to be Personal Attorney to the President. In fact, I brought in an attorney who truly a Presidential Historian.

Todd Blanche: We'll get to that. You don't recall having a communication with your daughter, we're still in November, where you said you were with him now, I'm talking about President Trump, and he wants me to go, just not sure the position, needs came up, and he told them it was complimentary, but not happy with the title I wanted.

Todd Blanche: Do you remember saying that to your daughter?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: And that title is Special Counsel to the President, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: And at the time -- I know eventually you're Personal Attorney, but at the time when you were having that conversation with the President Elect and with his newly named Chief of Staff, you wanted the title Special Counsel to the President and Mr. Priebus didn't like that title, correct?

Michael Cohen: I believe so, yes.

Todd Blanche: And President Trump expressed some frustration that his new team couldn't find a place for you at the White House, right?

Michael Cohen: That we had not come up to a role for me in the White House, that's correct.

Todd Blanche: Didn't you -- in the conversation I believe we're both talking about, didn't you say that President Trump was very complimentary to you, but they couldn't come up with a title yet?

Michael Cohen: Right. Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And then your daughter said, why not Special Counsel, who else would they give that to, Trump is President, he has the power to appoint anyone he wants, that's what she said to you?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And you told your daughter that you were disappointed that the Chief of Staff, Mr. Priebus, was the one who got to pick what your role was, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And you felt that way in part because you took some credit for Mr. Priebus getting the job as Chief of Staff, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: So part of your frustration, as you expressed to your daughter, was that now that the Chief of Staff that you had helped President Trump pick was put in charge of finding you a job, right?

Michael Cohen: Again, my daughter may have called it Special Counsel to the President. The role that I had been asking President Elect Trump for was Personal Attorney to the President, which is why, as I said to my daughter it's a hybrid role. I had already had other ideas in terms of what I wanted to do and what I needed to do financially for my family.

Todd Blanche: Well, what you really said to your daughter, and I am talking about on November 14th, is that you were very disappointed that Preibus was being given the power to determine my position, without me, he wouldn't even be in this spot, right?

Michael Cohen: I said that.

Todd Blanche: That wasn't about hybrid, that wasn't about being his Personal Attorney, that was frustration that President Trump's new Chief of Staff was given the power to select where you were going to go, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: You still even after November were still looking for a position in the White House, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir. No, sir, I was looking for that same title, as Personal Attorney to the President.

Todd Blanche: Well, at what point did you switch from wanting to work in the White House as Special Counsel or General Counsel's Office to wanting to be Personal Attorney?

Michael Cohen: I didn't want the General Counsel office. I made that crystal clear. I always wanted the title Personal Attorney to the President. I always said that there was no shame in being Personal Attorney to the President of the United States.

Todd Blanche: Well, early in November Mr. Cohen, there were no communications about Personal Attorney, all the communications were about whether you would be Chief of Staff and then Special Counsel to the President in the White House, correct?

Michael Cohen: That was for my ego, yes.

Todd Blanche: Well, two questions ago you said you always just wanted to be the Personal Attorney. But I'm looking at text messages in November where you're not talking about being Personal Attorney, Mr. Cohen, you're talking about wanting a job in the White House as Special Counsel to the President Trump, correct?

Michael Cohen: No, sir. If you look at the texts my daughter, I turn around and I state to her that I'm not the right person for Chief of Staff. Also, I also would not expect that I would be Attorney General because it wasn't within my qualifications.

Todd Blanche: But, you did think you were the right person to be Special Counsel to President Trump, you told that to your daughter, correct?

Michael Cohen: Personal Attorney to with Donald J. Trump is what I wanted. Later on in the text messages you see the clarification in that title name.

Todd Blanche: So, later on, meaning in December and maybe in January, you clarified to your daughter about what you meant in November, is that what you said?

Michael Cohen: My daughter used the title that I had at The Trump Organization, it was always supposed to be Personal Attorney to President Donald J. Trump.

Todd Blanche: Are you familiar with someone named Gary Cohen?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: Who is that?

Michael Cohen: Gary Cohen was the former President of Goldman Sachs.

Todd Blanche: And when you say former, did President Trump appoint him to be the Director of the National Economic Counsel?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: That was in that same period, in between the transition?

Michael Cohen: The transition, yes.

Todd Blanche: You were frustrated that Mr. Cohen was named to that position, weren't you?

Michael Cohen: I had asked for Mr. Cohen.

Todd Blanche: Were you frustrated that he was named in that position?

Michael Cohen: No, sir.

Todd Blanche: You were not despondent that he was being given a White House role and you were not?

Michael Cohen: No, sir.

Todd Blanche: You testified -- well, your testimony is that you never had a conversation with Mr. Davidson where you expressed frustration about Mr. Cohen?

Michael Cohen: I stated I don't recall having a conversation with Mr. Davidson about that.

Todd Blanche: Do you recall -- now we're talking we're in December now of 2016, your daughter expressed that it was ridiculous that Mr. Cohen was appointed and not you, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And she also complained that you were having a hard time getting tickets to the Inauguration Ball, correct?

Michael Cohen: I believe so.

Todd Blanche: Your daughter said that President Trump and his new people were walking all over you, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And you agreed with that, didn't you, at the time?

Michael Cohen: At the time.

Todd Blanche: You also agreed with your daughter that President Trump, and this is in December, isn't doing right by you in any way, correct?

Michael Cohen: I was still waiting for the title Personal Attorney to the President.

Todd Blanche: And, ultimately, you got that title in January, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: But you were disappointed that after all the work you had done for President Trump for nine and a half years, nobody, including President Trump, offered you a position in the White House?

Michael Cohen: That's not accurate.

Todd Blanche: You were not embarrassed that after all the work you had done for him you were left being his Personal Attorney and nothing more?

Michael Cohen: That's the role that I wanted. In fact, I asked Gary Cohen who provided me with the attorney Orin Snyder. And Orin Snyder and I, for about an hour, sat with President Elect Trump in his office expressing the reason why Personal Attorney to the President was the exact role that I should play. That's the role that they gave to me because this was a way that I could monetize that which I did.

Todd Blanche: Now, do you know somebody named Darrell Scott?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: Who is that?

Michael Cohen: Darrell Scott was my co-founder of the National Diversity Coalition for Trump. He is a pastor in Cleveland, Ohio.

Todd Blanche: The event that you -- the only event that you attended during the campaign was at Pastor Scott's church, is that right?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: That is the one you spoke at?

Michael Cohen: The New Spirit Revival Church.

Todd Blanche: You were friends with Pastor Scott?

Michael Cohen: We become friends, yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: You knew Pastor Scott for years and years, right?

Michael Cohen: I knew him for more than a year.

Todd Blanche: Well, did you know him in 2011 when there was some talk about whether President Trump would run for the presidency in 2012?

Michael Cohen: I don't recall if he was part of that.

Todd Blanche: So you recall only knowing him during the 2015/16 campaign?

Michael Cohen: I apologize. I don't recall if he was part of the 2011, but I have known him for years.

Todd Blanche: Did you all communicate on the phone?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: Over texts?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And in person?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: Do you recall expressing disappointment to Pastor Scott repeatedly that President Trump didn't bring you into his administration?

Michael Cohen: Not into the administration. I knew the role that I wanted to have and I may have expressed frustration, but I don't recall.

Todd Blanche: Well, do you not recall -- or let me ask it a different way. Did you have communications with Pastor Scott --

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: Let me finish. -- about your frustration that President Trump did not bring you to the White House?

Michael Cohen: I don't recall that.

Todd Blanche: Did you have communications with Pastor Scott even after President Trump was in the office of the Presidency about the fact that you weren't working in the White House and you weren't part of the administration?

Michael Cohen: I don't recall that.

Todd Blanche: Do you recall on National Prayer Day expressing frustration that you were sitting in your office and not in the White House with everyone else, all the people that you had worked with on the campaign, do you recall that?

Michael Cohen: That I wasn't invited, yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: Do you recall talking to Pastor Scott about that?

Michael Cohen: I believe so, yes.

Todd Blanche: What do you recall saying to him?

Michael Cohen: It would have nice had I been invited, considering everybody that was part of the Diversity Coalition, people that I helped put together, were all there and I wasn't.

Todd Blanche: But your testimony is: You didn't say to him at that time, "I should be working in the White House with President Trump?"

Michael Cohen: Not that I recall.

Todd Blanche: Do you recall communicating with Pastor Scott regularly on the phone and over texts asking him to put in a good word with President Trump on your behalf?

Michael Cohen: Yes, I recall that.

Todd Blanche: I am talking about 2015 and 2016, but even after the President was in the White House, do you recall that?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Todd Blanche: And your communications with him, this is while you were working at The Trump Organization and while you were Personal Attorney to President Trump, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: Your communications were to him, in sum and substance, were about putting in a good word with President Trump so the President Trump would bring you to the White House?

Michael Cohen: I don't recall. To the White House? I knew the role, again, that I wanted. I had already had the idea in advance, which is what I expressed to my daughter.

Todd Blanche: Why did you need Pastor Scott to put a good word in for you with President Trump?

Michael Cohen: I knew he was going to be seeing him. While you are there, say something.

Todd Blanche: What about during the campaign when you testified that you talked to President Trump almost every day?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Todd Blanche: Why did you need Pastor Scott to put in a good word for you along that time?

Michael Cohen: It's always good to have somebody else advocate.

Todd Blanche: What were you asking him to say to President Trump about you?

Michael Cohen: How important it was for the Diversity Coalition as a basis for the campaign and its success.

Todd Blanche: Do you recall in November of 2023, just a few months ago, your lawyer, not your lawyer that is here today, one of your lawyers, applied for early termination of supervised release on your behalf?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: As part of that application, do you recall that there were fake cases, meaning fake legal cases, included in the letter around that application?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Overruled.

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: What was your role in that situation, if you could explain that to the jury?

Michael Cohen: So, as I was helping my friend, who had just moved his law office, for another attempt to submit papers for early termination of supervised release, I went on Google Bard, which is an A.I. tool, and I typed in a series of queries regarding the Second Circuit here in New York decisions on early determination of supervised release.

Michael Cohen: And the reasons -- because in our papers, for whatever reason, I believe we had the Eighth Circuit, and it created a whole bunch of what they call, I think, phantom results, because A.I. wants to please the user. And I then provided to my counsel these three cases that were directly on point for why supervised release for me under the circumstances was just improper.

Michael Cohen: And I provided it to him and he included it in the document. And those citations were inaccurate. Not the sum and substance, but the citations themselves.

Todd Blanche: When you say inaccurate, the cases just didn't exist, correct?

Michael Cohen: Under that specific citation, correct.

Todd Blanche: But that wasn't my question, about the specific citation. My question was: The three cases that you gave to your attorney were not real cases, correct?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: And you knew that your lawyer was going to use those cases in support of your application, correct?

Michael Cohen: I gave them to him to use in support of the application, yes.

Todd Blanche: You were an attorney -- well, by that you were disbarred?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: You were an attorney for over 30 years?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And when you were a practicing attorney, you did corporate and litigation?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: Part of litigation is drafting briefs, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: You did that?

Michael Cohen: I did that.

Todd Blanche: All right. I want to talk about something you testified about on October -- excuse me -- on Tuesday. You testified about a phone call on October 24, okay, 2016, so that's two days right before you make a payment to the HELOC. And then you move money over from your HELOC to your LLC. Then you wire the money to Mr. Davidson on the 26th?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: Correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: Do you recall testifying in response to conversations from the prosecutor about the phone call you had with Mr. Schiller at it 8:02 p.m. on the 24th, two days earlier, do you recall testifying about that?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: You recall saying that you called Mr. Schiller on that evening because you wanted to speak to then Mr. Trump, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: You wanted to speak to President Trump to discuss the Stormy Daniels matter and the resolution of it, that was your testimony, right?

Michael Cohen: That was.

Todd Blanche: Then you testified just a couple of days ago that you were successful, you called Mr. Schiller and you had a conversation, and in that conversation you resolved you were moving forward to fund the deal, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: Can you explain to us how that works, you know that Mr. Schiller is with President Trump, and so you know that you can call his phone and that Mr. Schiller just hands President Trump the phone?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: Was he on speaker? Do you usually just have privacy with President Trump when that happens? Meaning, does Mr. Schiller put his cell phone on speaker and you talk to President Trump or does he actually give him the phone and you have a private conversation?

Michael Cohen: I've seen both.

Todd Blanche: On October 24, 2016, which one was it?

Michael Cohen: I don't know the answer. I wasn't with them.

Todd Blanche: Can you tell from your conversation with President Trump whether he was on speaker or whether you were just talking to him?

Michael Cohen: I didn't take notes.

Todd Blanche: So you don't recall either way?

Michael Cohen: No, sir.

Todd Blanche: But you recall that on that call -- I don't want to put words in your mouth, you discussed the Stormy Daniels matter and the resolution, and you also discussed the conversation would be that it was resolved, that you were going to move forward and fund the deal, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: That was your testimony?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: So I appreciate it was a long time ago, but what would you have said to President Trump on that phone call, what would he have said to you?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Todd Blanche: Do you have any recollection of what you said to him on that day?

Michael Cohen: We talked about the matter. That it was resolved.

Todd Blanche: I am not going to hold you to an exact language, when you talked about the matter, that it was resolved, is that the sort of thing that you would have said to him?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: I am sorry. How would you have said it to him?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Todd Blanche: The point is, you have a distinct and specific recollection, do you not, that on October 24th at 8 o'clock you talked to President Trump about the Stormy Daniels situation, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: Now, you testified in the Grand Jury last March, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: You didn't talk about this phone call in the Grand Jury, did you?

Michael Cohen: Not that I recall, no.

Todd Blanche: Do you want me to show you the Grand Jury transcript and you can check?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Todd Blanche: When you say you don't recall, do you recall talking about this phone call when you met with the prosecutors before your Grand Jury testimony?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Todd Blanche: Do you recall ever talking to the prosecutors prior to your testimony earlier this week about this phone call?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Overruled.

Michael Cohen: I don't recall.

Todd Blanche: So the first time that you recall having a conversation with President Trump on October 24th at 8:02 p.m. is when you testified two days ago?

Michael Cohen: No, sir. I just said I don't recall when I spoke to the DA about that specific matter.

Todd Blanche: On Tuesday you recall you were shown a particular call log between you and Mr. Schiller, and the prosecutor went right up to October 24th and said you had two phone calls that day, a voicemail and then a 1 minute and 36 minute phone call, do you remember that?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Todd Blanche: You said that was with President Trump, Mr. Trump, you said that?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And do you remember being interviewed on March 7th of last year in the District Attorney's Office, which was about a week before you testified, and not saying anything about this phone call?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Overruled.

Michael Cohen: I said I don't recall. They refreshed my memory.

Todd Blanche: Let me show you what has been marked for identification as B255.

Todd Blanche: This is just for the parties, the witness and the Court.

Todd Blanche: These are some notes from the meeting. You didn't take these notes, did you, Mr. Cohen?

Michael Cohen: No, I did not.

Todd Blanche: Do you see at the top the date March 7th?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: It started at 9 a.m.?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: If we can go to Page 9, please. Actually, the page before. If we can blow up the bottom line that says October 23rd to 25th.

Note: [Displayed]

Todd Blanche: Can you take a look at that to see if it refreshes your recollection that you didn't return the phone call?

Susan Hoffinger: Can we approach?

Susan Hoffinger: Judge, this is classic Bornholdt. He is not directing -- it is classic People v. Bornholdt. He is not directing his attention to where he was asked the question about it.

Todd Blanche: I don't understand what the objection is.

Juan Merchan: The objection is, that you tried to impeach him with an admission, but you haven't established that he was asked the question about it.

Susan Hoffinger: People versus Bornholdt.

Todd Blanche: Your Honor, that's not what this is showing. They walked through every day and he talks about what he remembers for each day. As a matter of fact, on the 26th, which I am about to show him, he has a specific recollection of telephone calls with Trump. On the 23rd to 25th there is a dash -- verbatim writing of everything that he is saying.

Todd Blanche: There is no question and answer. It's just giving an explanation of what he remembers.

Susan Hoffinger: Which is exactly why he may have not been asked the question.

Juan Merchan: That's why we have Bornholdt, to ensure that people are not impeached simply because they forgot to say something. You have to establish that he was asked the question. That he was directed to a particular area and they failed to -- given the opportunity, they failed to reveal it.

Todd Blanche: If we can put back up to 255, just for the witness, the parties, and the Court. Go to Page 8.

Note: [Continued cross examination by Todd Blanche.]

Todd Blanche: Can you take a look at that, Mr. Cohen, and see if it refreshes your recollection about whether you were asked any questions about the phone call on the 25th?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: Does that refresh your recollection about whether you were asked any questions about phone calls on the 24th?

Michael Cohen: No, sir.

Todd Blanche: And you have no independent recollection of that meeting that would answer that question?

Michael Cohen: I do not.

Todd Blanche: Now, if we can look at the next page of those notes and blow up that top.

Note: [Displayed]

Todd Blanche: If you look at the third line. It talks about calls between you and President Trump on the 26th, correct, two days later?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Why don't you direct his attention and have him read it.

Todd Blanche: Take a look at the third line. If you can read the third and fourth line.

Susan Hoffinger: Is there a question?

Todd Blanche: Does that refresh your recollection that you did talk on that date about phone calls with President Trump on the 26th?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Todd Blanche: Do you have a recollection of talking on that day with the prosecutors about phone calls with President Trump on the 26th?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Overruled.

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And you did, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: Do you remember -- I appreciate this goes back a while, do you remember at that time, October 22nd, 23rd, 24th, 2016, you were receiving a bunch of ongoing and continuing harassment phone calls, so somebody was calling you constantly, do you remember that?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And do you remember that on the 24th, at around 7 o'clock at night, the person who was harassing you forgot to block the number and you got the number, do you remember that?

Michael Cohen: No, sir.

Todd Blanche: Let me show you what has been marked for identification, just for you, the Court, and the parties as B165. We're going to highlight some of this for you.

Todd Blanche: If we can highlight just the first couple of texts.

Todd Blanche: So, if you see, this is just for you. But, do you see the number, and that's you, then a number that ends in 0594, do you see that?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: Do you see your text to this number that says, "This number has been sent to Secret Service for your ongoing and continuous harassment to both myself as well as to the organizations named on it?"

Michael Cohen: I do.

Todd Blanche: That is at 7:10 p.m., right?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: And then the text back says, "It wasn't me, my friend told me to call, I am sorry for this, I won't do it again," right?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: Then you respond and said, "They're going to have to explain that to the Secret Service," because you have been receiving dozens of these harassing calls over the past three days, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: "If you are a minor, I suggest you notify your parent or guardian," that's what you said to them, right?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Todd Blanche: The person texted you back and said, "I didn't do it, I am 14, please don't do this." And you asked them to have their parent or guardian contact --

Susan Hoffinger: Objection. He is reading from the document.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Todd Blanche: You eventually said to have their parent or guardian contact you?

Michael Cohen: When they expressed they were 14, I felt it was proper.

Todd Blanche: That was at 7:24 p.m. on that same date, October 24, right?

Michael Cohen: I am sorry. What time?

Todd Blanche: The last text was at 7:24 p.m.?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: So that whole exchange was between around 7:10 and 7:24 p.m.?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: That was an exchange, because you had been receiving a bunch of harassing phone calls the prior three days?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: Do you recall at 7:48 texting Keith Schiller about this 14 year old, do you recall that? Do you recall that?

Michael Cohen: I don't recall.

Todd Blanche: Do you recall texting Keith Schiller at 7:48 p.m., "Who can I speak to regarding harassing calls to myself and office, the dope forgot to block his call on one of them," you don't recall that?

Michael Cohen: It sounds right. Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: Let's take a look. If we can show the witness B266. Just the witness, the Court and parties.

Todd Blanche: This is a series of texts between you and Mr. Schiller on that same date. You said: "Who can I speak to regarding harassing calls to my cell and office, the dope forgot to block his call on one of them?" Do you see that?

Michael Cohen: I see it.

Todd Blanche: Mr. Schiller says --

Susan Hoffinger: Objection, reading a document not in evidence.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Todd Blanche: Do you recall at 8:02, your initial text to Mr. Schiller is at 7:48, and then at 8:02 he says, "Call me," to you, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: So if we can put up what is already in evidence as Exhibit 341 on the screen, please.

Note: [Displayed]

Todd Blanche: These are the phone calls between you and Mr. Schiller, right?

Todd Blanche: And if we can go to the second page and highlight the 10/24, the 8:01 and 8:02 calls, please.

Note: [Displayed]

Todd Blanche: Do you see --

Todd Blanche: If you can highlight the 10/24, the 8:01 and 8:02 calls. I see them.

Todd Blanche: That's fine. That shows a voicemail at 8:01 from Keith Schiller to you?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And then at 8:02, he says, "Call me," and then it looks like you then call him at 8:02 for 1 minute and 36 seconds, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: If you look at the "call me" text. If we can take that down for a second and put back up B166, which is your text message from that day.

Note: [Displayed]

Todd Blanche: You will agree with me that Mr. Schiller told you to call him at 8:02 and 21 seconds, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And so you called him back.

Todd Blanche: And if we can go back to that phone record chart on 341 and highlight the bottom.

Note: [Displayed]

Todd Blanche: You called him back at 8:02, it was likely after 8:02 and 21 seconds, right?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: This is the call that you testified about on Tuesday, that you had a conversation with President Trump, that you called Keith Schiller, it wasn't to talk to Keith Schiller, it was to talk to President Trump about the Stormy deal and the moving forward, that was your testimony?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: Let's look at what happens next. Let's go back to B166, at 8:04. You text Mr. Schiller the number --

Susan Hoffinger: I am going to object to reading a document that is not in evidence.

Juan Merchan: It's not in evidence.

Todd Blanche: Your Honor, I will offer B166 in evidence.

Juan Merchan: Any objection?

Susan Hoffinger: I think he just needs to lay a foundation.

Todd Blanche: You see the texts that you are looking at, B166, between you and Mr. Schiller. You can look at the first page too.

Todd Blanche: Please highlight the top third of the page.

Todd Blanche: See, it says Cellebrite, it has your number, Mr. Schiller's number?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: We offer B166.

Susan Hoffinger: With redactions?

Juan Merchan: If you can make the necessary redactions.

Todd Blanche: We'll redact it, of course, absolutely. For now can it be shown to the jury and not in the courtroom?

Juan Merchan: I don't know if you can do that. We were told that we can. It is being shown to the jury but not anybody else in the Court.

Todd Blanche: Let's look at it with the jury. Just to go back now to the conversation between you and Keith. "Who can I speak to regarding phone calls to my cell and office, the dope forgot to block one of them." That was at 7:48. At 8:02 he said: Call me. I can put it back up again. At 8:01 is when he leaves that voicemail?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: You call him back at 8:02 for 1 minute and 36 seconds. At 8:04, you text him the number of the 14 year old who was prank calling you, correct?

Michael Cohen: I did, yes.

Todd Blanche: Immediately he texts you back within a few seconds, he said, "Okay?"

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: The very next morning, at 7:58 a.m., you say, "Did you reach the family," right?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: Let's take that down.

Todd Blanche: When you testified on Tuesday that that you had a specific recollection that that 1 minute and 36 minute phone call on October 24th was not with Keith Schiller, that you called Keith Schiller and he passed the phone to President Trump, you finalized the deal with Stormy Daniels and you said, "We're going to move forward," and he said, "yes," because you kept him informed all the time, that was your testimony, right?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: That was a lie, you were actually talking to Mr. Schiller about the fact that you were getting harassing phone calls from a 14 year old, correct?

Michael Cohen: Part of it was the 14 year old, but I know that Keith was with Mr. Trump at the time and there was more than potentially just this. That's what I recall based upon the documents that I reviewed.

Todd Blanche: Five minutes ago I asked you if you remember harassing phone calls, and you said no. And then I refreshed your recollection. It's totally fair if you don't remember. But now your testimony is that you were testifying truthfully on Tuesday, to a 1 minute and 36 second phone call, and you had enough time in that 1 minute and 36 seconds to update Mr. Schiller about all the problems you were having with these harassing phone calls and also update President Trump on the status of the Stormy Daniels situation because you had to keep him informed because every time you made any decision, you ran it by The Boss, that's your testimony?

Michael Cohen: I always ran everything by The Boss immediately. And in this case, it could have just been saying everything is being taken care of, it's going to get resolved.

Todd Blanche: That's not what you testified to on Tuesday. You said you had a recollection of a phone call on October 24th at 8:02 p.m. where you called Mr. Schiller and he gave the phone to President Trump and you told President Trump about the updates, that you were moving forward with the funding, and he said, okay, go. That was a lie, you did not talk to President Trump on that night, you talked to Keith Schiller about what we just went through, you can admit it?

Michael Cohen: No, sir, I can't. I am not certain that is accurate.

Todd Blanche: You were certain it was accurate on Tuesday when you were under oath and testifying, you were certain it was accurate you had a phone call to President Trump, but now you are saying you are not certain it was accurate?

Michael Cohen: Based upon the records that I was able to review, in light of everything that was going on, I believe I also spoke to Mr. President Trump and told him everything regarding the Stormy Daniels matter was being worked on and it's going to be resolved.

Todd Blanche: We are not asking for your belief. This jury doesn't want to hear what you think happened?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Todd Blanche: I want to put up People's Exhibit 262. It's in evidence.

Note: [Displayed]

Todd Blanche: Sir, you may recall that the People showed you this exhibit and you testified that these were certain text messages between you and Mr. Schiller. It spans March 4, 2016 to November 4, 2016. Do you see the exhibit?

Michael Cohen: I am sorry, one more time the dates.

Todd Blanche: The dates, I believe --

Todd Blanche: If we can blow up the last one.

Note: [Displayed]

Todd Blanche: It's from March 4, 2016 to November 4, 2016?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: You were shown all those texts by the prosecution?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: If we can focus in on the October timeframe on this exhibit. Did the People include the text messages that I just showed you between you and Keith will Schiller on October 24th on this exhibit?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: You see those text messages on that exhibit?

Michael Cohen: I don't.

Todd Blanche: The People did not bother to include those on this chart, did they?

Michael Cohen: Not on this chart, no, sir.

Todd Blanche: When they prepped you and they showed you this chart, right -- they prepped you and they showed you this chart, you didn't see this chart for the first time on Tuesday, did you?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Todd Blanche: When they prepped you, did they show you a chart?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Todd Blanche: Were you ever shown in prep the texts that I just showed you between you and Mr. Schiller about the harassing phone calls?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Overruled.

Michael Cohen: No, sir.

Todd Blanche: The first time that you seen those texts in seven or eight years was just a few minutes ago?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: Given that your testimony to this jury is still, when you testified on Tuesday, that you had a specific recollection of a phone call with President Trump on October 24th, at 8:02, for 1 minute and 36 seconds, that you were telling the truth?

Michael Cohen: Based upon what was going on and based upon the other message text messages and so on, regarding the Stormy Daniels matter, yes, I believe I was telling the truth.

Todd Blanche: So you were not basing your testimony on Tuesday based upon your memory, you were basing it on documents that the People showed you in prep, is that your testimony?

Michael Cohen: That refreshed my memory, yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: Was that true for just phone calls or was it true for other phone calls too?

Michael Cohen: I don't recall telephone calls on a specific date going back to 2016. Based upon the records and based upon the documents that you were reviewing.

Todd Blanche: Mr. Cohen you just said that you don't recall phone calls back in 2016. That is not what you testified to on Tuesday. On Tuesday you testified that you remembered the phone call?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Todd Blanche: Is now a good time for break?

Juan Merchan: Jurors, let's go ahead and take our luncheon recess. Please remember all of the admonitions. Please do not discuss the case either among yourselves or with anyone else. Please continue to keep an open mind as to the defendant's guilt or innocence. Please do not form or express an opinion as to the defendant's guilt or innocence.

Juan Merchan: Enjoy your lunch.

Juan Merchan: You can step down.

Juan Merchan: Be seated. I will see you at 2:15.

Note: [A-F-T-E-R-N-O-O-N S-E-S-S-I-O-N.]

Todd Blanche: Just briefly, we have a curative instruction drafted by the People regarding the unsealing of the existence of the indictment. My intention was to rehabilitate the questions right out of the box after lunch. If you want to take a look at that.

Juan Merchan: Let me take a look at it. So let's see how it goes with you. If it looks like it needs to be cleaned up some more, I will read the instructions.

Joshua Steinglass: Very respectfully, the only relevance of this entire line of questioning was to suggest there was an improper leak of evidence. They use the word "leak." You sustained it. They used it once without being sustained and once with being sustained, some kind of improper leak. Two, that Michael Cohen or Jeremy Rosenberg or both engaged in this conduct.

Joshua Steinglass: There is no other reason to ask those questions. And, respectfully, this is not something that should be cleaned up by the person who asks the questions or on redirect. This should be cured by the Court. The Court has given numerous limiting instructions in realtime at the defendant's request. You made this application at the morning break.

Joshua Steinglass: It still hasn't been cleaned up. To be honest with you, I don't think cleaning it up by the parties is the right way to go. I think your Honor ought to clarify the record and eliminate any suggestion there was some kind of impropriety. I think those questions were entirely improper. I think it should be up to the Court to cure it, not Mr. Blanche.

Todd Blanche: Judge, there are texts between Mr. Cohen and the detective where it's clearly --

Juan Merchan: What?

Todd Blanche: Where it's clear the news of the indictment had leaked. Your Honor had sustained objections around that. The questions were not asked out of the blue. There was a very good faith basis for the questions. Indeed, the detective said they told the New York Times before they told you. Nevertheless, it's done.

Todd Blanche: I wasn't trying to do anything other than elicit the fact, which is entirely appropriate, that a detective assigned to this case thought it appropriate to tell a witness it was done. You sustained the objection. Your Honor, I am happy to clean it up. It shouldn't be an instruction from the Court to assume there was something improper about the question.

Todd Blanche: There is evidence that it happened.

Juan Merchan: There is nothing improper about the question except that we now know that you left the jury with the mistaken impression. I appreciate the record you are making, Mr. Steinglass. I take instructions from the bench to the jury very seriously. So I weigh that heavily before I decide to do it. I am going to give Mr. Blanche the opportunity to do it himself.

Juan Merchan: If I am not satisfied what he has done fairly and completely cleans up the issue, I will take care of it.

Joshua Steinglass: The last point I will make -- that's fine. I don't know if the witness knows that the Order was issued by the Court unsealing the fact of the indictment on March 30th.

Juan Merchan: I realize that. That's why I am keeping my options open. I might have to give the limiting instruction.

Joshua Steinglass: Thank you.

Juan Merchan: Separately, I have been informed one of the jurors apparently has a 1:30 appointment next Thursday. I have not yet spoken to that juror. I would like to take it up with that juror in the robing room during the break. I would like to invite one attorney from each side to join me in the robing room with the Court Reporter so we can discuss it further.

Juan Merchan: All right. Let's get the witness.

Juan Merchan: Good afternoon, Mr. Cohen.

Juan Merchan: Please be seated.

Court Clerk: Case on trial continued. All jurors are present and properly seated.

Juan Merchan: Mr. Blanche.

Todd Blanche: May I continue?

Juan Merchan: Yes.

Note: [Continued cross examination by Todd Blanche.]

Todd Blanche: Good afternoon, Mr. Cohen. In the beginning of the day today, do you remember I showed you some text messages between you and Detective Rosenberg?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Todd Blanche: Now, I want to make sure there is no confusion. You don't have any evidence that anybody at the District Attorney's Office improperly leaked or even leaked at all the indictment before it was unsealed, do you?

Michael Cohen: No.

Todd Blanche: We were talking about dates, and just to go back to that time a little over a year ago, you know that around March 30th or actually on March 30th, the Court unsealed the indictment, so it was then part of the public record, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: So to the extent that I asked you questions about what you learned or heard from Detective Rosenberg about the indictment by March 30th, it was public and unsealed, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Juan Merchan: Please approach.

Note: [Whereupon, the following proceedings were held at sidebar.]

Juan Merchan: That was good, but you have to take it a step further. At the time he appeared on CNN and spoke about it, it was already unsealed.

Todd Blanche: All right.

Note: [Whereupon, the following proceedings were held in open court.]

Note: [Continued direct examination by Todd Blanche.]

Todd Blanche: Just a couple of more questions about that, Mr. Cohen. I also asked you questions about appearing on television on that day, right?

Michael Cohen: You did.

Todd Blanche: And just to be clear, when you did those interviews, the indictment was unsealed by the Court, correct?

Michael Cohen: I had read it through the New York Times article.

Todd Blanche: But beyond that, if I suggested to you that you were not supposed to talk about it on CNN, I want to make sure you understand by the time you went on CNN it was public?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: Your Honor, before lunch we had offered B166 without redactions. We now have redactions.

Juan Merchan: Thank you.

Todd Blanche: If we can put up B165, just for the witness, the Court and the parties.

Todd Blanche: Mr. Cohen, you are looking at what we talked about before lunch, which is a series of messages between you and an unknown who says they're 14?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: The difference now is we applied redactions, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: Now, the number that you are communicating with is 0594, the rest is redacted?

Michael Cohen: That is correct.

Todd Blanche: We offer B165.

Susan Hoffinger: No objection.

Juan Merchan: Accepted.

Note: [Whereupon, Defense Exhibit B165 was received and marked into evidence.]

Todd Blanche: Just very quickly, if we can blow up the first four or five texts back and forth.

Note: [Displayed]

Todd Blanche: So these are the texts that we talked about before lunch where this 0594 probably mistakenly forgot to block their number at some point. Can you read what they said to you and what you said back?

Michael Cohen: This number has just been sent to Secret Service for your ongoing and continuous harassment to both my cell as well as to the organization's main line.

Todd Blanche: That was at 7:10. At 7:11 we answer back. He says: It wasn't me?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: At 7:11 he says, "My friend told me to call," correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: Three minutes later an apology, "I'm sorry for this?"

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: A further apology, "I won't do it again." What do you say at 7:15? If we can focus on that part of the tech exchange?

Michael Cohen: "You will need to explain this to Secret Service as we have been receiving dozens of these harassing calls over the past three days. If you are a minor, I suggest you notify your parent or guardian."

Todd Blanche: Then the response back a few minutes later, one minute later, "I didn't do it," in all caps. Then another one: "I'm 14." Another one: "Please don't do this." Then, you as you testified earlier, if we can go down to the 7:17 text, what do you say back?

Michael Cohen: "Please have your parent or guardian contact me before Secret Service reaches out to them."

Todd Blanche: Just so when you testified earlier that that last message back to this 0594 number, that was at 7:24 and 50 seconds, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: You testified on Monday -- what I would like to do, Mr. Cohen, is going through in a timely fashion what you testified about on Monday. I want to start in 2011. You said you came across a poll that suggested that President Trump might be a good candidate for President, correct?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: I just want to make sure we're on the same page. That poll was actually in 2010, late 2000s?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And there was some press coverage about it at the time, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: You testified you caused a website to be created "Should Trump run," right?

Michael Cohen: Dot com.

Todd Blanche: Dot com. And that was put up in November of 2010, does that sound right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: At the time, is it fair to say that the press regarded this as a little bit of a stunt by President Trump?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And a little bit later on, in March of 2011, isn't it true the National Enquirer actually ran an article about this issue and about how strong President Trump looked in the polls?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: You actually worked with the National Enquirer to help get that story out, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: This was in 2011?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And they actually -- the National Enquirer actually wrote a positive story about you personally at that time as being the person who started "Should Trump Run Dot Com," right?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: You were the source or one of the sources for that story, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And the reason for the question is, you worked very hard -- putting aside what happened in 2015 and 2016, you worked very hard during your time working for The Trump Organization to get positive stories into the press about President Trump and all the things he was doing, right?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: You also worked very hard to make sure that there were positive stories about you at times as well, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: Now, can you explain to the jury how you go about doing that? So how do you go about getting a reporter or a newspaper or interviewer to say positive things about you or about The Trump Organization?

Michael Cohen: So I know many of the journalists/reporters in the various different newspapers, and have a longstanding relationship with, again, many of them, what I would do, depending upon what the issue is, whether it's a construction, an acquisition, whether it had something to do with one of the various businesses that fell within the umbrella of the Trump Organization, I would reach out to them and I would ask them if they would be interested in doing an article about this specific topic.

Michael Cohen: That I would give them the exclusive on it.

Todd Blanche: That was one example. If you learned -- now, let's take the opposite. If you learned that a reporter or a newspaper or magazine was going to write something negative about The Trump Organization or of the The Apprentice or President Trump himself, what kind of steps would you take, if any, to either get rid of that story or to minimize the negative press?

Michael Cohen: So that's a little bit different. One of the things is instead of me calling the journalist, the journalist was calling me to send an email to somebody at The Trump Organization saying we're writing a story about whatever the topic may be. We have a deadline of say 5 p.m., so we would like for you to comment on the topic.

Michael Cohen: What I would do then is, I would immediately go to Mr. Trump's office and I would discuss that specific topic with him and we would come up with a response, a way to craft a response that I would then take back to the journalist.

Todd Blanche: You did that a lot, is that fair?

Michael Cohen: That's fair.

Todd Blanche: You had a Rolodex full of reporters, contact information, is that right?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: So you wouldn't always have to go into President Trump's office to ask him how to handle the story, you often just handled it on your own, depending on the story, correct?

Michael Cohen: No, sir.

Todd Blanche: You never reached back out to a reporter, ever, without first checking with President Trump?

Michael Cohen: It was my routine to always advise Mr. Trump, because if the story that I was going to put out is not the way he would want it, one, it would cause him to blow up at me. And, two, it would probably mean the end of my job.

Todd Blanche: Over the course of nine and a half years, every time that you worked to change the narrative of a story, you did that never on your own, only in consultation with President Trump?

Michael Cohen: For the story, yes. Always in consultation, but remember, one magazine, one newspaper would pick up the same story. So I would use the same statement over and over and over again. So with those, I would not go to Mr. Trump and tell him. I would just send it out to my list of reporters. Or if they contacted me, hey, we're looking for a comment on so and so. Generally what would happen, after one newspaper puts out a story, somebody else tends to follow and so we just mimic the same response to the next magazine or the next newspaper and so on.

Todd Blanche: There were plenty of times, Mr. Cohen in 2015 and 2016, for example, that you would comment about stories without speaking to President Trump at all, isn't that true?

Michael Cohen: No, sir. I would always get a comment or something in line with a conversation that we had on that specific topic. Again, if I did that, and he didn't like the response, it would probably cost me my job.

Todd Blanche: But you knew when President Trump was running in 2015 and 2016, you knew the campaign at times was very frustrated with you because you were going off message from what President Trump and the campaign wanted, correct?

Michael Cohen: I knew they were upset about it. However, Mr. Trump had turned around and advised me, I don't answer to them. And so, he's free to speak on his own as I was not part of the campaign. I was a surrogate.

Todd Blanche: So your testimony is that the frustration towards you didn't come from President Trump but it came from the campaign staffers?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: Going back to 2011, eventually President Trump says, "I'm not going to run?"

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: Several months later you worked with Mr. Davidson to cause The Dirty to remove the article about Ms. Daniels, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: That was in May or so, President Trump said he wasn't going to run, correct?

Michael Cohen: It was around the sweeps at the time.

Todd Blanche: Much later, in 2011, is when The Dirty article came down and you talked to Mr. Davidson, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: So fair to say that the first time that you heard about that incident and the story by Ms. Daniels is when you talked to President Trump about it, he said that he was worried about what his family would think, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes, as well as, of course, for the brand.

Todd Blanche: Well, do you recall meeting with law enforcement on February 18, 2021, and saying that the first thing that President Trump said to you was that his family won't like that very much, that's true, right?

Michael Cohen: That is true.

Todd Blanche: And often, including on that occasion, you handled that type of story by threatening legal action, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: Whether it's a cease and desist by you or by another party, that's a frequently common way that you handled negative stories or stories that you want to be taken off of websites or not be published?

Michael Cohen: Along with -- The Dirty was actually effectuated by Keith Davidson, not by myself.

Todd Blanche: Understood. But my question was: Who did it? The question was: The plan was for you and Mr. Davidson to threaten legal action. A letter was written by Mr. Davidson and it worked?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: The way you handled it, the way you handled that wasn't unusual, you handled it many times for President Trump that way, threatening legal action, writing a letter or having somebody else do that working with you, correct?

Michael Cohen: Not necessarily a letter. Many times it was just via phone.

Todd Blanche: And that's not unique to you, that happens all the time in litigation when a party is trying to get a story taken down, for example?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Todd Blanche: You've used that tool many times over the years, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And some of the reporters that you had a very strong relationship with include folks like Chris Cuomo?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: Katy Tur?

Michael Cohen: Yes?

Todd Blanche: And we talked a little bit on Tuesday about a reporter named Maggie Haberman?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: So, talking for a few minutes about Ms. Haberman, who does she work for?

Michael Cohen: She is with the New York Times.

Todd Blanche: And over the years -- well, let me ask you this: When did you first meet Ms. Haberman?

Michael Cohen: Over 20 years ago.

Todd Blanche: So you met before so early 2000?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: Over the years, you have a very strong -- would you describe your relationship with her very strong?

Michael Cohen: I would.

Todd Blanche: You asked her to write positive stories about you, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: As a matter of fact, when you started in your official role in 2017 as President Trump's Personal Attorney, you asked her to write a story and say what a great idea it was?

Michael Cohen: I asked her if she would write a story.

Todd Blanche: That was my question. You asked her to write a story saying how good it was that you had that role for President Trump, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And, in exchange for that, you would give tips to Ms. Haberman, correct?

Michael Cohen: Not in exchange, I would use Ms. Haberman if the story was something that I believed the New York Times would run, and if it wasn't the New York Times style story, I would go to a different newspaper.

Todd Blanche: But there were a number of times when you gave Ms. Haberman a scoop, as you testified about, on Tuesday?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: Even at times -- by the way, you recorded a lot of conversations that you had with reporters, right?

Michael Cohen: No, sir, I won't characterize it as a lot.

Todd Blanche: How many would you characterize it as?

Michael Cohen: Forty.

Todd Blanche: So 40, with 40 separate reporters, or just a handful of reporters that you recorded?

Michael Cohen: Over the ten years, it was probably a little more than a handful.

Todd Blanche: Why did you record conversations you were having with reporters?

Michael Cohen: I used to use the recordings as well -- as sort of to memorialize it for note taking, so I could go back and listen to it, instead of not paying attention when I was talking to them. Especially if it revolved around being a surrogate for the campaign. That way, I could use the conversation to figure out what was the best response when I was on television, so that it made sense and that it was what I believed Mr. Trump would want.

Todd Blanche: Well, have you stopped -- did there come a time when you stopped recording conversations with reporters?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: When was that?

Michael Cohen: After the election.

Todd Blanche: After which election?

Michael Cohen: 2016

Todd Blanche: You didn't record conversations with reporters in 2017 and 2018?

Michael Cohen: I would have to check.

Todd Blanche: We'll check together in a minute.

Michael Cohen: Okay.

Todd Blanche: Did you at one point record -- well, do you recall sharing a recording that you had made of another person with Ms. Haberman to help her write a story?

Michael Cohen: I am sorry, one more time.

Todd Blanche: Do you recall in 2018, in February, sharing with Ms. Haberman a recording you had made where you recorded a different person to help her write a story, do you recall that?

Michael Cohen: I recall sharing a recording. I don't remember the exact nature of it.

Todd Blanche: Well, do you remember --

Todd Blanche: Well, let's show you, if I may B174, just for the Court, the witness and the parties. And if we can go to Page 295.

Todd Blanche: So you see a back and forth text there between you and Ms. Haberman and then you see the title of article. We can go to the next page. And then you see that you received an article from Ms. Haberman. Then you answer her back at the bottom in green. Can you take a look at that.

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And you say -- do you not --

Todd Blanche: Can you take that down.

Todd Blanche: To help her write another story, you're going to share with her a recording that you made of another individual, right?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: By the way, did you tell people you were recording them?

Michael Cohen: No, sir.

Todd Blanche: Do you remember on several occasions people asked you if you were recording them and you said no on the recording?

Michael Cohen: No, sir.

Todd Blanche: You don't remember that?

Michael Cohen: I don't remember that specifically. It's not illegal in New York for one party.

Todd Blanche: Mr. Cohen, I did not ask you whether you were breaking the law. I just asked you if you told the people you were recording them. And you didn't, right?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: Ms. Haberman over the years has written a lot of articles about you?

Michael Cohen: I don't know how to characterize a lot.

Todd Blanche: Is 38 a lot?

Michael Cohen: Sounds like it, yes.

Todd Blanche: Well, let's take a look at B242, just for the witness, the parties and the Court.

Todd Blanche: Take a look at what's just a screen shot of a number of articles that Ms. Haberman has written about you, including as recently as two weeks ago, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: Does 38 articles sound about right?

Michael Cohen: I didn't participate in all 38 of these.

Todd Blanche: My question is, the reason why -- one of the reasons why you want relationships with reporters is to give you an opportunity to respond before an article is written, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: To give you an opportunity to push information to the reporter if you think an article should be written, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: Also to shape an article -- so, maybe that's not the word you would use, you can pick the word, but to make the article come out in a way as favorable to you or at the time President Trump as possible, right?

Michael Cohen: That is correct.

Todd Blanche: So the example I just went through with Ms. Haberman, you had several reporters where you had the same relationship?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: Now, with reporters, you communicated over text?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: Signal?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: Dust?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: WhatsApp sometimes?

Michael Cohen: Sometimes.

Todd Blanche: Obviously, on the phone.

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: Did you distinguish among those types of communications, depending on the story or the reporter, or it depended on what you were using with the reporter?

Michael Cohen: Depends on what I was using with the reporter. If it was a private or an unusual type of situation, I would go to one of the encrypted apps.

Todd Blanche: Now, you said that you recorded approximately 40 separate times with reporters. But there were 95 secret recordings on your iPhone?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: Who were you recording besides reporters?

Michael Cohen: This gentleman that you showed me.

Todd Blanche: Which gentleman?

Michael Cohen: Fromer.

Todd Blanche: Which gentleman?

Michael Cohen: Fromer. He is not a reporter.

Todd Blanche: When you say "the person I just showed you," you mean the recordings you were sharing with Ms. Haberman was a recording between you and that individual, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: That's one. I am not looking for you to name, you know, 55.

Michael Cohen: The reason I am bringing him up -- the reason I am brining him up --

Todd Blanche: Sure.

Michael Cohen: Because there were multiple recordings of him. That's why I said there were about 40.

Todd Blanche: So, besides him, you recorded -- who else did you record surreptitiously, it was reporters, that individual, who else?

Michael Cohen: I recorded -- off the top of my head, I can't tell you. Jeff Zucker on one event. Mr. Trump on another event. And there are other reporters.

Todd Blanche: Let's talk about the recording that you made of your then client, correct, President Trump?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: You understand that it's not ethical for a lawyer to record a conversations with their client, correct?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: And you were a member of the New York Bar at the time?

Michael Cohen: I was.

Todd Blanche: You know that there are a lot of New York Bar opinions on this, but unless there is very specific circumstance, you're not supposed to record your client, correct?

Michael Cohen: You're not except, of course, Crime-Fraud Exception Rule 12.

Note: [Whereupon, Theresa Magniccari, Senior Court Reporter was relieved by Susan Pearce-Bates, Principal Court Reporter.]

Todd Blanche: The crime fraud exception, didn't you testify that you were recording -- that you recorded your client because you wanted to convince Mr. Pecker that money was coming?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: So, are you saying that you did the recording under a client fraud exception?

Michael Cohen: No. You asked if there are exceptions, and I said yes, the crime fraud exception rule.

Todd Blanche: So, you --

Michael Cohen: I was just giving the example.

Todd Blanche: Just so I understand it, you surreptitiously recorded your client so that you could play a privileged, recorded communication between you and your client with a third-party, that's what you did, right?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: And, again, you never -- you certainly didn't tell President Trump you were recording him, did you?

Michael Cohen: I did not.

Todd Blanche: Now, you talked about 2015 when President Trump announced he was going to run, and he comes down to Trump Tower, he comes down the escalator, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: Prior to that President Trump had launched an Exploratory Committee in March of 2015, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And an Exploratory Committee is a step in the right direction for someone who may seek to run for the Office of the Presidency of the United States, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And in June of that year is when he announced, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: Now, you testified that you have very specific recollection of a meeting that you then had at Trump Tower with yourself, President Trump and David Pecker, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And this is a meeting where you all discussed what National Enquirer, Mr. Pecker, would do to help President Trump, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: You testified earlier this week that the so-called power of the National Enquirer is its placement in supermarkets, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: But you never said that to the Grand Jury, did you?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Todd Blanche: That's not something -- did you ever discuss the power of the National Enquirer's placement in the supermarket with anybody prior to your testimony on Monday?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Overruled.

Michael Cohen: I am so sorry. One more time, please.

Todd Blanche: Prior to your testimony earlier this week when you testified that the power of the National Enquirer is one of the -- is its placement in the supermarket, my question is, had you ever told anybody that before your testimony this week?

Michael Cohen: Not that I recall.

Todd Blanche: Now, and when we talked about this on Tuesday afternoon, but you learned about what David Pecker testified about in this trial, didn't you?

Michael Cohen: No, sir.

Todd Blanche: You didn't say on TikTok, from everything I heard from people today, David Pecker is basically corroborating what I have been saying for years?

Michael Cohen: Yes. That's a general statement.

Todd Blanche: Because people told you about Mr. Pecker's statements, you testified about that on Tuesday, correct?

Michael Cohen: What David Pecker was testifying to, people just corroborated that it corroborates my story. That I am -- that I have been talking about for the last six years, not the specifics.

Todd Blanche: So -- and you testified thereafter about a story that the National Enquirer folks alerted to you involving Dino Sajudin, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: Now, you testified a lot about that on Monday, but that story, by the way, is completely false, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And by, completely false, I mean, money was paid to keep the story from getting out, but the story was false, correct?

Michael Cohen: I believe so, yes.

Todd Blanche: Well, do you have any doubt in your mind that it was false?

Michael Cohen: No, sir.

Todd Blanche: And isn't it true that at the time when you talked to President Trump about this false story, he was worried about the story getting out because of his employees, right?

Michael Cohen: He mentioned that I should speak to them as well, yes.

Todd Blanche: Well, he told you, did he not or -- you previously told law enforcement that he told you that he was concerned about the story because it involved people that still worked with him and worked for him, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And so, it was important to him to keep it from getting out, correct?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: Now, you testified on Monday when you were talking about this story that you kept President Trump updated all along the way, right?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: And there was a liquidation clause in that contract, correct?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: You never told President Trump details like that, did you?

Michael Cohen: No, sir.

Todd Blanche: So things like that, within the contract, you were the lawyer, you were his lawyer, you handled it, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: Now, as it relates to the Ms. McDougal story, which you testified about earlier this week, you testified that you were worried at the time that this story would have a significant impact on the campaign, that's what you testified to, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: But President Trump didn't share your view, did he?

Michael Cohen: I am not sure I would agree with that.

Todd Blanche: Didn't you previously tell the Government that President Trump said he didn't think this story would hurt him?

Michael Cohen: I would need to see that document, please.

Todd Blanche: Sure.

Todd Blanche: If we can show the witness what's marked for identification as B-127. Just for the witness, the Court and the parties.

Note: [Displayed]

Todd Blanche: Take a look at that, notes from a March 7, 2023, interview.

Michael Cohen: Which bullet point, please?

Todd Blanche: If you get to the third bullet, Mr. Cohen, you can stop there.

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: You can take that down. Thank you.

Todd Blanche: So, let me just re-ask my question. When you testified that you believed that the story would have a significant impact on the campaign, and my simple question to you is that President Trump, at least initially, didn't think it would hurt him, correct?

Michael Cohen: Initially, yes.

Todd Blanche: Now, you also have testified, I am sorry, told the Government that one of the things that President Trump was worried about as it relates to this story was his family, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And his family meaning his wife but also his children, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: Now, you testified that you spoke -- you testified on Monday that you have a recollection of a telephone call with President Trump on June 16, 2016. Do you remember testifying about that?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: Now, they showed you some text messages with Mr. Schiller, and that was another time that you testified that you called Mr. Schiller, and he gave the phone to President Trump. And that you have a specific recollection you testified and you recall providing him with updates. Do you remember that testimony?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Todd Blanche: You don't have a specific recollection to a telephone call, a telephone call that you had in June of 2016, do you?

Michael Cohen: No, sir.

Todd Blanche: And just to put some context around that. It was not -- I am not quibbling with your answer. It was a long time ago, correct?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: At that time, how many phone calls do you think you were getting in a day?

Michael Cohen: Many.

Todd Blanche: Many like 20?

Michael Cohen: Hundreds.

Todd Blanche: A day?

Michael Cohen: Sure.

Todd Blanche: Well, that's -- let's just say 50 a day.

Michael Cohen: Okay.

Todd Blanche: So, that means that you are getting around 350 a week, is that right? I know you are estimating.

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: That's around 1400 a month, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: So, we are talking about, conservatively, 14,000 calls a year in 2017 -- 2016 to 2017?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And the same would be true, basically, 2018, and then until you went to prison for 13 months, that number is about right?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: So -- and I know we are just estimating, we are talking about more than 50,000 phone calls between 2016 and today, would you agree with that?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And so, when you testified on Monday and Tuesday, about specific conversations that you had with different folks, Mr. Pecker, Mr. Howard and President Trump, you were not testifying from a specific recollection of that phone call, were you?

Michael Cohen: I was.

Todd Blanche: You were?

Michael Cohen: I was.

Todd Blanche: So 50, 60,000 telephone calls later, you have still specific recollections about phone calls?

Michael Cohen: Because these phone calls are things that I have been talking about for the last six years. They are -- and they were extremely important, and they were all consuming. So, while I did not know that it took place at 8:02 p.m., what I did recall is the conversation that I had had, not the specific time of the conversation, but rather the specific sum and substance because it was such a significant event and because I had been telling the same story about it for six years.

Todd Blanche: So, you now -- so, your testimony is that you have been talking about these phone calls for six years?

Michael Cohen: That I have mentioned of these phone calls or a specific phone call where I had advised Mr. Trump that I was going across the street to First Republic Bank, where I had just done the transaction, everything is done because it was that significant.

Todd Blanche: I am talking right now about this June 16, 2016, phone call that you testified about on Monday and Tuesday, okay? You testified that -- the prosecutor asked you whether you had a specific recollection and you said, yes, that you had a specific recollection.

Susan Hoffinger: Objection, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: Overruled.

Todd Blanche: And so, what I am trying to do is reconcile what you said a few minutes ago, that you don't have a specific recollection, with what you just said, which is that you do. For this phone call, do you have a specific recollection of this phone call in June of 2016?

Michael Cohen: Can you show me which phone call we are referring to?

Todd Blanche: Sure.

Todd Blanche: If we can put up, it's already in evidence, People's Exhibit 349. And if we can go to June 16, 2016, that phone call at 6:51 p.m., and just blow that up, please.

Note: [Displayed]

Michael Cohen: I am sorry. Which date are we looking at?

Todd Blanche: We should be able to blow it up for you, Mr. Cohen. We are looking at a June 16, 2016, phone call at 6:51 p.m. Do you see that?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Todd Blanche: And how long was this phone call?

Michael Cohen: Two minutes and 31 seconds.

Todd Blanche: Just so I understand your testimony, as you sit here today, you have a specific recollection of that phone call on June 16, 2016?

Michael Cohen: Based upon the other documents that I was able to look at, what it did was jogged into my memory, again, the story that I have been telling in regard to this conversation.

Todd Blanche: I am still looking for an answer. Do you have a specific recollection, or do you not have a specific recollection?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Michael Cohen: I recalled, as I had stated before, I recalled the conversation based upon the other documents.

Todd Blanche: Well, I understand that, but my question isn't whether you recall a conversation. I am asking you whether you recall that conversation on that phone call, at that time, on that day in June of 2016?

Michael Cohen: Again, based off of the documents that I had looked at and reviewed, I did.

Todd Blanche: Do you remember, for example, speaking for a very long time with Chris Cuomo just mere seconds before this call?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: What were you talking to Mr. Cuomo about?

Michael Cohen: We were talking about my appearance and we were talking about different topics.

Todd Blanche: Were you talking about your feelings? I didn't hear what you said.

Michael Cohen: I was talking about my appearance.

Todd Blanche: Your appearance. Got it. Your appearance to be on his show?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: So, you now also have a specific recollection of a conversation you had with Chris Cuomo eight years ago?

Michael Cohen: It was over an hour. It was a very long conversation, and, again, I recorded it as contemporaneous note-taking so that I could pay attention to the conversation, and I could ensure that the things that I brought up on his show were the things that I wanted to say. So I crafted my responses.

Todd Blanche: And you remember that conversation today?

Michael Cohen: I remember having the conversation, yes.

Todd Blanche: Do you -- I want to talk a minute about the recording that you did surreptitiously with President Trump. Now, that recording was about two minutes, 51 seconds, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And you didn't actually start talking until about a minute into that recording, is that correct?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: And you were talking to President Trump at the time about transferring information regarding our friend David, which was Mr. Pecker, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And the information you were talking about transferring was, supposedly, all kinds of -- a secret box about bad information on President Trump, right?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: And at the time there was a concern because AMI was looking to potentially acquire Time Magazine or the other way around, right?

Michael Cohen: No, sir.

Todd Blanche: What was happening?

Michael Cohen: David Pecker was being considered to be the CEO of Time Incorporated, Time Magazine, and the concern was being that these documents were the property of AMI, that he would not be able to, of course, take them. That whoever the new CEO might be, may end up not being as supportive of Mr. Trump as David was.

Michael Cohen: And so, we were concerned that potentially one of those stories could be leaked.

Todd Blanche: And you -- and President Trump said, he could get hit by a bus, meaning something could happen to Mr. Pecker, and the rest would be the same, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: Now, the concern here was even beyond the election, right? Meaning, this conversation wasn't tied to the election, it was a real concern that Mr. Pecker could get hit by a bus at any time or something could happen to him and you guys wouldn't have those files, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: Now -- and you said, I am all over it? You said, I'm all over it, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: So, eventually, you learned that there was nothing in those files, correct?

Michael Cohen: I was told by Mr. Pecker that, not to worry. There is nothing in the files.

Todd Blanche: That was later though, right?

Michael Cohen: After he was not accepted as the CEO of Time.

Todd Blanche: And then you testified about a comment that was made in response to a question about financing. And you say -- and President Trump says, what financing? And then there is a comment made about cash, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir. Mr. Trump turned around and used the word cash.

Todd Blanche: And when he says, cash, he is not talking about Benjamins and green dollar bills, right? He is talking about paying for something with cash, not financing, correct?

Michael Cohen: No, sir.

Todd Blanche: Well, isn't it true that over the time you worked for President Trump he very often would purchase things with cash, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: As a matter of fact, you testified you talked to the prosecutors on multiple occasions about the fact that President Trump would purchase buildings with cash, right, at times?

Michael Cohen: I don't know what you are referring to, sir.

Todd Blanche: Well, were there times when President Trump acquired property, whether it's a golf course, whether it's a building and paid cash, meaning no financing, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: That happened, right?

Michael Cohen: I may have said that using that term, yes.

Todd Blanche: No. No. Put aside the term. I am just asking you separate from that. There were times when President Trump bought property as part of his business and didn't finance it, right?

Michael Cohen: I am not aware of that.

Todd Blanche: Well, you are aware that you said that there were certain properties that President Trump paid for, just paid cash, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes. That was -- that was the message that I was to use, that there is no financing. He is very rich and that he paid all cash.

Todd Blanche: Yes. But my point is, Mr. Cohen, when you say he is very rich, and he pays all cash, you are not saying that you or Mr. Trump or his sons go down to the bank with a bunch of bags full of cash and buy something, you are saying that it's not financed. We are just going to pay with cash. We are not going to finance, right?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: When you testified on Tuesday that President Trump when he said, cash, was talking about green, that's not what he is talking about, is it?

Michael Cohen: It was, which is why, sir, I used the word, no, no, no, check. We needed to do it by check.

Todd Blanche: Hang on for a second. When you say, we need to do it by check, that's when this audio gets cut off, right?

Michael Cohen: It was not exactly after that. It was after I received a phone gall.

Todd Blanche: Right. As you say, check, or the word check is said, it cuts off right then, correct?

Michael Cohen: No. I believe there is a few seconds more where I say hello to somebody on the phone.

Todd Blanche: Now, which phone did you make that recording on?

Michael Cohen: On one of the two phones.

Todd Blanche: When you say, one of the two phones, you mean one of the two phones that the FBI took from you in April 2018?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And that's one of the two phones that they eventually returned to you, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And then that's one of the phones that you -- one of those phones that you eventually gave to, with consent, to the People, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: Good.

Todd Blanche: If we can put up what's already admitted into evidence as 248.

Note: [Displayed]

Todd Blanche: If we can --

Todd Blanche: This is a transcript that we talked about on Tuesday, Mr. Cohen, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: Or Monday. If we can go to the second page, and you will see the last thing that's said is Donald J. Trump, check, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: Now, we can take that down.

Todd Blanche: The conversation continued, correct?

Michael Cohen: The conversation continued, yes.

Todd Blanche: And you received a phone call from a bank, right?

Michael Cohen: Capital One Bank.

Todd Blanche: And your testimony is that you answered that call?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Todd Blanche: So, just so I understand, you are in a meeting with President Trump talking to him about the financing or cash for the McDougal story, and you are recording him, but the phone rings, and you just answer that call?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Todd Blanche: And what was the bank calling you about?

Michael Cohen: I don't specifically remember. I just remember it was a big issue.

Todd Blanche: If you don't have a recollection --

Michael Cohen: If my recollection is correct, it was -- I was the subject of identity theft the second time. People were going into the account and taking money out.

Todd Blanche: Wait. You do remember, or you don't remember?

Michael Cohen: I believe that's what it was. I am not a hundred percent certain.

Todd Blanche: Well, you started out by saying, you don't remember. Then gave a long explanation, and then you said you do remember, but you are not a hundred percent certain.

Susan Hoffinger: Objection your Honor.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Todd Blanche: Now, when you hung up with that phone call that you had with the bank, you were still talking to President Trump?

Michael Cohen: For a few moments more, yes.

Todd Blanche: You didn't restart the recording?

Michael Cohen: No, sir.

Todd Blanche: And the transcript, or the recording, you could hear what you say is your are answering a phone, right?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: So did you have two phones at the time?

Michael Cohen: I had two phones at the time, yes.

Todd Blanche: Did the call come in on the phone that you were recording President Trump on?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: Are you sure about that?

Michael Cohen: Positive.

Todd Blanche: You testified -- I just want to talk for a few minutes about your testimony about the use of encrypted apps as it relates to communications you were having with Mr. Pecker, Mr. Howard and others associated with the Non-Disclosure Agreement, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: You testified that you would use those apps at times because you wanted to keep conversations confidential, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: But you will agree with me that a lot of the most key communications regarding that deal, the deal with Ms. McDougal, and also the NDA with Ms. Daniels, were just on texts, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And the documents, the NDA, it was just emailed back and forth, right?

Michael Cohen: Between myself and Mr. Davidson, yes.

Todd Blanche: Right. But you weren't using Signal to send the NDA, were you?

Michael Cohen: No, sir.

Todd Blanche: You just emailed it?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Juan Merchan: Mr. Blanche, can we take our break now?

Todd Blanche: Sure.

Juan Merchan: All right. Jurors let's take our afternoon recess. We will see you in about 15 minutes.

Note: [Whereupon, the jurors exited the courtroom.]

Juan Merchan: You may be seated. Can I have one attorney from each side and the court reporter join me in the robing room?

Note: [Whereupon, proceedings were held in Judge Merchan's robing room.]

Lieutenant: Please be seated. Come to order. Part 59 is back in session.

Juan Merchan: All right. So we had a conference in the robing room with one of the alternates who has indicated a conflict. Counsel was there. Have you had a chance to fill in your colleagues on what was discussed?

Joshua Steinglass: Yes. I think our suggestion is let's just not promise the jury that they are going to be able to go home at one o'clock Thursday. Let's wait and see where we are at in terms of what part of the case we are up to, and then decide if it is feasible. It's an alternate juror. We can decide whether to keep the alternate juror or release them, depending on where we are at.

Todd Blanche: That makes sense. I think that our view would be, if it comes to it, and we need the afternoon, which we probably will, we can address it then.

Juan Merchan: Okay. I agree. Let's get the witness, please.

Lieutenant: Witness entering.

Note: [Whereupon, the witness entered the courtroom and was properly seated.]

Juan Merchan: Let's get the jury, please.

Sergeant: Yes, judge. All rise. Jury entering the courtroom.

Note: [Whereupon, the jury entered the courtroom and was properly seated.]

Juan Merchan: You may be seated.

Court Clerk: Case on trial continued. All jurors are present and properly seated.

Juan Merchan: Mr. Blanche.

Note: [Continued direct examination by Todd Blanche.]

Todd Blanche: I want to talk for a few minutes about the $130,000 payment you made to Mr. Davidson, okay?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: So, by the way, you learned from Mr. Davidson along the way that another news organization was interested in buying Ms. Daniels' story, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: At what time during the process did you hear that from Mr. Davidson?

Michael Cohen: After we had failed to transfer $130,000 as per Mr. Davidson's cut-off date.

Todd Blanche: The news organization or the organization that was interested Mr. Davidson told you was ABC, correct?

Michael Cohen: ABC, and I believe it was also Daily Beast.

Todd Blanche: Well, was that later?

Michael Cohen: Yes. It was ABC.

Todd Blanche: So, and in particular, you were told that ABC had offered, in essence, the same amount of money Mr. Davidson was trying to get from you, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: $130,000?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: Who is the reporter that you, put aside whether it is true, that Mr. Davidson told you about that was trying to negotiate that with Ms. Daniels?

Michael Cohen: I am actually blanking on his name.

Todd Blanche: Was it an individual named John Santucci?

Michael Cohen: John Santucci, yes, sir, ABC News.

Todd Blanche: And you never confirmed one way or the other whether that was true?

Michael Cohen: I spoke to Mr. Santucci about it.

Todd Blanche: When did you speak to him?

Michael Cohen: He contacted me and asked me whether or not I was responsible, or I knew that we were responsible for them not getting the story. John Santucci used to come to the office quite a bit.

Todd Blanche: So, and you talked about that interaction you just talked about in a recording that you made with Mr. Davidson March 27, 2018, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: So, do you remember when that phone call -- that meeting with Mr. Santucci was in relation to 2016, October, and when you told Mr. Davidson about it in March of 2018?

Michael Cohen: I said October.

Todd Blanche: So, what did you say to Mr. Santucci, and what did he say to you?

Michael Cohen: First, I was a little shocked that John Santucci actually, did it. Meaning, he had to spend quite a bit of time following the Trump campaign, and then, of course, he denied that they were involved.

Todd Blanche: Now, did he -- do you recall Mr. Santucci asking you whether you, meaning Mr. Cohen, was able to kill that story because he said Ms. Daniels had gone dark?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir. That's what I was saying before.

Todd Blanche: Okay, understood. Now, when you met with the District Attorney, with Mr. Pomerantz, so a while ago, do you remember saying that you believed that Mr. Davidson on behalf of Ms. Daniels was engaging in extortion?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Overruled. You can answer.

Michael Cohen: Yes. I recall making a statement like that.

Todd Blanche: What statement did you make?

Michael Cohen: That they were extorting Mr. Trump.

Todd Blanche: And the reason you said that is because of all the factors you talked about on Monday or Tuesday, right, you said that there was urgency because of the Access Hollywood tape, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And there was an election and in your mind, in your mind, there was either two choices, pay it, or don't pay it, and the story comes out, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: But you went a long time without paying, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes. We went several weeks without paying.

Todd Blanche: And, ultimately, though, you did?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And we will talk more about that in a little bit. But you referred in direct to this payment as a hush money payment. Do you recall that?

Michael Cohen: Yes. It's been called, the hush money payment.

Todd Blanche: I am not asking whether it's been called that. I am asking whether on direct you referred to it as a hush money payment?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And do you recall the prosecutor saying it was a payoff. And you said, yes. Do you remember that?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: Make no mistake, this was a completely legal, binding contract?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: Let's pull it up, Exhibit 276. It's in evidence.

Todd Blanche: You testified about this on Tuesday. This is a very long contract, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And it's signed by you, right?

Michael Cohen: It is.

Todd Blanche: And Mr. Davidson?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And Ms. Daniels?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: But Donald J. Trump never signed anything associated with this agreement. He didn't sign this agreement. He didn't sign the side letter either, correct?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: But in your mind then, and now, this is a perfectly legal contract, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: What I mean by that is, a Non-Disclosure Agreement, an NDA, a settlement between two parties happens all the time, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes, they do.

Todd Blanche: Now, you testified that there were two names used Peggy Peterson and David Dennison, right, pseudonyms? Those are not the real names, pseudonyms?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: Who came up with those names?

Michael Cohen: Keith Davidson did.

Todd Blanche: Do you know why?

Michael Cohen: I believe he knew a David Dennison, and Peggy Peterson, I don't know the answer.

Todd Blanche: Now, you testified that you have, again, still focusing on the legality of this contract, you testified that you lied on the account opening documents with your bank and called it -- said that it was going to be for consulting because you were worried that if you told the truth they would have further questions, correct?

Michael Cohen: Or they wouldn't open up the account.

Todd Blanche: Or they would say, no way, we are not doing it, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: But you agree with me that there is nothing illegal about a settlement contract between two parties both of whom had lawyers, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And you weren't interacting directly with Ms. Daniels, you were going through Mr. Davidson, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: And you testified you never met Ms. Daniels until the podcast, right?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: And, similarly, you were a lawyer for -- you were a lawyer at that time working on behalf of The Trump Organization, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: Working on behalf of --

Susan Hoffinger: Judge, may we approach?

Juan Merchan: Yes.

Note: [Discussion is held at sidebar, on the record.]

Susan Hoffinger: I think there have been more than a few questions now about the lawyers involved in this contract. When we were at a similar place with Keith Davidson, your Honor sustained an objection. Defense counsel has persisted with the presence of counsel issue, and so, I just want to alert the Court, I think at this point two or three questions have been asked about a lawyer.

Susan Hoffinger: I didn't object. Now, I am going to start objecting.

Todd Blanche: What is wrong with asking what the lawyers --

Juan Merchan: Well, what's wrong with it, it is a very slippery slope. As you know, we dealt with the whole presence of counsel, appearance of counsel, advise of counsel, and we don't want to go there. In fact, on this, unless I am mistaken in reviewing the proposed jury charge, there was an instruction there regarding the presence of counsel.

Juan Merchan: So I would stay away from that. I think you asked enough questions on that.

Todd Blanche: Thank you.

Note: [Discussion at sidebar concluded, and the following occurred in open court.]

Todd Blanche: Now, you testified about your work for the Trump Organization. You reported directly to President Trump, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And over the nine and a half years you worked for the Trump Organization, you did work for the Organization, legal work, correct?

Michael Cohen: No. Not much legal work.

Todd Blanche: Well, were you assigned, for example, to help with new projects, potential new projects?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: That's for The Trump Organization, correct?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: And you worked on The Apprentice, right?

Michael Cohen: I assisted in The Apprentice, yes.

Todd Blanche: That was for The Trump Organization, right?

Michael Cohen: That was certainly for Mr. Trump.

Todd Blanche: No. No. You are telling me that you worked with The Apprentice, and it wasn't for The Trump Organization, it was for Mr. Trump?

Michael Cohen: I am not sure if The Apprentice was for The Trump Organization, as opposed to Mr. Trump personally.

Todd Blanche: Well, was The Apprentice -- was the money made from The Apprentice part of The Trump Organization revenues?

Michael Cohen: That I wouldn't know.

Todd Blanche: Did you -- and then you did personal work for President Trump, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And you did personal legal work for some of the kids, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: You said you didn't recall doing any work for Eric Trump, but for Donald Trump, Jr.?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And for Ivanka Trump, yes?

Michael Cohen: Ivanka I said I couldn't recall, but it seems possible.

Todd Blanche: And for Melania, President Trump's wife as well, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And you never had a retainer agreement with any of those individuals, did you?

Michael Cohen: No, sir.

Todd Blanche: And the reason why you didn't have a retainer agreement is because you didn't need one, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And you didn't need one because you were employed by the Trump Organization, correct?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: And so, you knew you were going to get paid, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: And there were some parts of your salary you didn't know, that would be bonus? You knew your salary?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: So, you didn't have to worry when you get -- when you did personal work for Donald Trump, Jr. about a retainer agreement because you were getting paid by The Trump Organization, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: Now, you testified multiple times on Tuesday that when you were President Trump's personal attorney in 2017, you had no retainer agreement, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: But the truthful testimony is that in the whole time you worked for The Trump Organization, you never had a retainer agreement, correct?

Michael Cohen: I had -- I never had a retainer agreement.

Todd Blanche: So, it's not just January 2017, that you did not have a retainer agreement. It is from the day you never went back to your law firm, and The Trump Organization sent some guys over and packed up your bags and you started a working for Donald J. Trump, and you never had a retainer agreement, right?

Michael Cohen: No, sir.

Todd Blanche: And, by the way, nothing wrong with that, correct?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Juan Merchan: I am sorry. Can you repeat that, please?

Todd Blanche: Is there anything wrong in your view, you were a lawyer, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And you were acting as a lawyer for --

Juan Merchan: Overruled. I am sorry. The objection is overruled.

Todd Blanche: You were acting as a lawyer the whole time you worked for The Trump Organization?

Michael Cohen: Well, I did legal matters and non-legal matters.

Note: [Whereupon, Principal Court Reporter Susan Pearce-Bates was relieved by Senior Court Reporter Lisa Kramsky.]

Note: [Continued direct examination by Todd Blanche.]

Todd Blanche: Understood. But you did legal matters?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: And, ethically, there was nothing wrong, correct?

Michael Cohen: I was an employee of the Trump Organization, nothing unethical.

Todd Blanche: Right. So when you were an employee, you had a job with The Trump Organization, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And your job was to report directly to President Trump, right?

Michael Cohen: To whatever Mr. Trump wanted me to do.

Todd Blanche: You were an Executive Vice President, right?

Michael Cohen: Right. Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And if that direction included doing legal work for Melania Trump, for example, you did it, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And, ethically, nothing wrong with that, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: Because you know under New York Ethics Rules, you don't need a Retainer Agreement to do work for a client, do you?

Michael Cohen: No, sir.

Todd Blanche: Now, I want to talk for a minute about --

Todd Blanche: If we can put up what's already admitted in evidence as 201, please.

Note: [Displayed]

Todd Blanche: You -- we went through this letter on direct. Do you recognize this letter?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Todd Blanche: This is February 8th, 2018. It's a letter to the Federal Election Commission, correct?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: Now, this letter was put in in response to a complaint that was filed earlier by Common Cause, right?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: Now, I want to first highlight the first paragraph. And your lawyers -- by the way, you read this letter before it went out, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: Your lawyers write that they are writing on behalf of you, in response to the Common Cause Complaint and they are responding to it, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: If we can go to the second paragraph.

Note: [Displayed]

Todd Blanche: So, this second paragraph says: "In a private transaction in 2016, before the US Presidential Election, Mr. Cohen used his own personal funds to facilitate a payment of $130,000 to Ms. Stephanie Clifford." "Neither The Trump Organization nor the Trump Campaign was a party to the transaction with Ms. Clifford and neither reimbursed Mr. Cohen for the payment directly or indirectly." Right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: So, by the way, I believe you testified to this, that's true, right, I know you said that it's --

Michael Cohen: It's an omission.

Todd Blanche: But that it is a true statement, right?

Michael Cohen: That is a true statement.

Todd Blanche: Meaning, you used your own funds to make the payments to Ms. Daniels?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And neither The Trump Organization nor The Campaign paid you back, right?

Michael Cohen: Was a party to the transaction, they were not.

Todd Blanche: Well, they weren't a party to the transaction, and because they had -- they didn't give you any money, right?

Michael Cohen: No reimbursement, correct.

Todd Blanche: Because President Trump reimbursed you from his own personal funds?

Michael Cohen: Either from President Trump's -- from his own funds or from The Trust.

Todd Blanche: So if we can bring the third paragraph down, now, please.

Note: [Displayed]

Todd Blanche: This is responding directly to the allegations that were in the Common Cause Complaint, right? It says they are speculative, and that neither your LLC made any in-kind contributions to Donald J. Trump for President or any other Presidential Campaign Committee. It also said, I think, accurately, that you were not a Government employee.

Todd Blanche: And that's right, right? That's correct?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: And that it doesn't constitute a campaign contribution or expenditure and, therefore, the FEC lacks jurisdiction over this matter, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: Now --

Todd Blanche: We can take that down.

Todd Blanche: -- that same day, well, that was February 13th. The complaint was filed before that, right, the Common Cause Complaint?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: And the complaint, is that a public or a sealed document?

Michael Cohen: Sealed document, I believe.

Todd Blanche: So, but you're -- I'm right that you actually shared or showed the complaint to a bunch of reporters before it was public, right?

Michael Cohen: I believe so.

Todd Blanche: And that's a sealed document, right? And you were not necessarily giving it to the reporters, but you're showing it to them, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes, I may have showed it.

Todd Blanche: Well, do you have any doubt that you showed it?

Michael Cohen: No, sir.

Todd Blanche: And you were very angry that the complaint had been filed, right?

Michael Cohen: I was.

Todd Blanche: And you told some reporters that you were going to seek sanctions, potentially Rule 11 sanctions, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And, at that point, you were sick of having to defend yourself from these frivolous allegations, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: Now, if we can put up 202, which is already in evidence.

Note: [Displayed]

Todd Blanche: This is the statement that you issued the same day, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And you wrote that?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: We won't read the whole thing, but you said on Tuesday, that you didn't plan to provide any further comment because you were worried that by issuing the statement you would start getting a lot of calls, right?

Michael Cohen: I wrote that, yes.

Todd Blanche: And that's why you wrote that on the second to last paragraph, right?

Michael Cohen: No, sir.

Todd Blanche: No, that's not why?

Michael Cohen: That's not why.

Todd Blanche: I must have misunderstood your testimony from Tuesday. You didn't want to provide any further comment, right?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: And the reason why you put that in the statement is because you were worried that if you just sent out a statement without that, reporters would want you to comment, right?

Michael Cohen: They would be asking me the question, in the paragraph above it, "Neither The Trump Organization nor The Trump Campaign was a party to the transaction." My concern was that they would expand upon it and they would ask me about Mr. Trump personally or some other account.

Todd Blanche: Now, if we could highlight the very last paragraph.

Note: [Displayed]

Todd Blanche: It says: "Just because something isn't true doesn't mean that it can't cause you harm or damage. I will always protect Mr. Trump." You wrote that, right?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Todd Blanche: Now, when you wrote that, do you recall sending that statement out to a ton of reporters?

Michael Cohen: I sure did.

Todd Blanche: And you followed up that statement by sending it to them, you followed up with some communications with them making it clear that you believed and that you felt strongly that that statement was completely true, right?

Michael Cohen: I was validating the statement that I had sent out with that paragraph.

Todd Blanche: When you say that you were validating it, you mean you were telling the reporters that what you wrote was true?

Michael Cohen: I wanted them to believe it was true, yes.

Todd Blanche: So did you call them and say, I want you to believe this is true?

Michael Cohen: No, sir.

Todd Blanche: Or did you call them and say, it is true?

Michael Cohen: I called and told them, this is true.

Todd Blanche: And you -- you also, and this is, again, is in February of 2018, you recorded yourself talking to reporters, telling them that your statement was true, right? Among other things?

Michael Cohen: Amongst other things, yes.

Todd Blanche: And you did that -- you even said, and correct me if I'm wrong, to one reporter, they had to believe you, that you are a really bad liar. You said that, right?

Michael Cohen: I believe so, yes.

Todd Blanche: But the testimony in this trial is that you were lying to them when you told them that, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And you recorded them, at that time in 2018, for what reason?

Michael Cohen: I don't recall. I don't recall why I recorded it. Maybe it was a different part of the conversation.

Todd Blanche: So it may have been for some other reason other than what we're talking about on the screen and what you were talking about as far as trying to validate your statement?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And that statement, by the way, was approved by your lawyers at the time, at McDermott Will & Emery, is that right?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: And they were the ones that wrote the letter, which is 201, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: So -- and you worked with them to make sure that the statement was truthful, correct?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Todd Blanche: And you worked with them to make sure that the letter was truthful, correct?

Michael Cohen: I worked with them to put this letter out, which, again, I have characterized as deceptive.

Todd Blanche: I understand your characterization of it, but the reality is, we just read it. Nothing on that letter is not the truth, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: So -- but is it your testimony that you were lying to your lawyers, to the McDermott lawyer?

Michael Cohen: No, sir.

Susan Hoffinger: I'm going to object here, Judge.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Todd Blanche: I'm going to move to another area.

Juan Merchan: Why don't we stop at this point. All right. Jurors, I know that we were going to stop today by 4:00, so we are going to stop now. Before I excuse you, I ask you to please not talk either among yourselves or with anyone else about anything related to the case. Please continue to keep an open mind. Do not form or express an opinion about the defendant's guilt or innocence until all of the evidence is in, and I have given you my final instructions on the law, and I have directed you to begin your deliberations.

Juan Merchan: Do not request, accept, agree to accept or discuss with any person the receipt or acceptance of any payment or benefit in return for supplying any information concerning the trial. Report directly to me any incident within your knowledge involving an attempt by any person improperly to influence you or any members of the jury.

Juan Merchan: Do not visit or view any of the locations discussed in the testimony. And do not use any program or electronic device to search for and view any location discussed in the testimony. Do not read, view or listen to any accounts or discussions of case, and that includes the reading or the listening to the reading of any transcripts of the trial, or the reading of posts on any court site.

Juan Merchan: Do not attempt to research any fact, issue or law related to the case. Do not communicate with anyone about the case by any means, including by telephone, text messages, email or the internet. And do not Google or otherwise search for any information about the case, or the law which applies to the case or the people involved in the case.

Juan Merchan: I hope you have a good weekend. I will see you Monday at 9:30:

Court Officer: All rise.

Juan Merchan: You may be seated. Mr. Cohen, thank you. You may step down.

Juan Merchan: Mr. Blanche, we had spoken about using this time to address some issues that you wanted to take up.

Todd Blanche: Yes, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: Yes. Please proceed.

Todd Blanche: I will turn it over to my colleague.

Juan Merchan: Okay.

Emil Bove: Thank you, Judge. What we are hoping to address is the potential testimony of the expert that has been discussed in the motions in limine, Brad Smith, regarding Campaign Finance Law. And your Honor set forth in your ruling on that motion a series of categories that you would accept or allow testimony from Mr. Smith on. And the one that we wanted to discuss -- the category that we wanted to discuss is general definitions and terms that relate directly to this case, such as campaign contributions.

Emil Bove: And I think, just to frame the conversation, what has changed since the time of the ruling is that both parties had put in requested jury instructions and both parties are seeking instructions regarding FECA and some of the definitions at issue. So one of the reasons that we wanted to bring this up before bringing the expert in is to give your Honor a sense of what we would be seeking to do and to make sure that we are not encroaching on your Honor's potential legal instructions.

Emil Bove: You have at once both parties who are asking the Court, I think, for instructions on a similar area. And we just want to make sure that the Court is still contemplating what I think is set up as sort of a battle of the experts on some of these issues.

Juan Merchan: That's fine. You understand that at this point those are just requests. I haven't ruled on any/either request.

Emil Bove: Of course, Judge. And that's why we just wanted to flag this. And, if I could, I would proffer the scope of what we would be seeking to do through Mr. Smith.

Juan Merchan: Sure.

Emil Bove: So what we would like to do is touch upon basic statutory definitions, and I will discuss those more specifically, and then there are phrases within those definitions that we think it's important, that one way or another the jury gets some guidance on, whether that is through the competing experts that have been noticed or your Honor.

Emil Bove: I can talk about the ones that we are focused on, and one of them is the meaning of the phrase "For the Purpose of Influencing An Election For Federal Office." The meaning of that --

Juan Merchan: Just give me one second.

Emil Bove: Yes.

Juan Merchan: Can you repeat that again?

Emil Bove: The phrase "For the Purpose of Influencing An Election For Federal Office." And that's a statutory phrase. And then both parties have requested instructions regarding what I will describe as "The Irrespective Rule." And that's from the FEC's regulations. And then the third issue is "The Press Exemptions" where we've requested an instruction.

Emil Bove: I don't think that there is a competing request, and we would be seeking to elicit testimony regarding that exemption from Mr. Smith. So, for basic statutory definitions, I think your Honor has seen those in the parties' proposals, "contribution," "relative individual contribution limits," the term "expenditure," and the term "coordinated expenditure" are, I think, what would be the focus.

Emil Bove: And within a couple of those definitions the statute lays out that phrase "For The Purpose of Influencing an Election." And so that's why we think -- we would seek to elicit from Mr. Smith an interpretation of what that phrase means. And, really, what we would be seeking to do through him, Judge, is sort of track what is in the request that we've submitted to your Honor.

Emil Bove: So by tracking that phrase is giving content by the Supreme Court's decision in Buckley, that the test is an objective one -- excuse me, an objective one under the D.C. Circuit's ruling in Orloski. We would seek to have Mr. Smith describe the facts of Orloski a little bit so that the jury can understand what it means to have an objective test for the concept of "For The Purpose of Influencing an Election." And then describe the -- then you are relating to the Congressman Jim Moran 5141 that's cited in our papers, again, describing some facts, to give the jury a sense of a situation where the FEC has applied that term and how they have done it. Then "The Irrespective Rule" --

Juan Merchan: You are referring to past decisions and/or hypotheticals?

Emil Bove: Not hypotheticals, Judge. Just the past decisions that are cited in our request to charge. So that's "For The Purpose of Influencing The Election." Next, I mentioned "The Irrespective Rule," which is set out in the FEC's regulations and cited, I think, by both parties in their request to charge. It's at 11 CFR 113 -- I'm sorry. .1(g). And so, we seek to have Mr. Smith discuss that rule, and discuss the focus on whether an expense would exist irrespective of the candidate's campaign, which we think is an important issue for the jury to consider with respect to whether the payments at issue could be considered expenditures and/or contributions.

Emil Bove: And then talk about a little bit how that regulation was developed beginning in 1995. We've cited for your Honor our request for the Federal Register Provisions that discuss the FEC's thinking about that. And, again, through Mr. Smith, what we're doing is trying to give the jury a sense of what the requirements are for this term and how the FEC has applied them.

Emil Bove: And so, we would walk through a couple more of the MURs that are cited in our request, 7025, 4944. And there is an advisory opinion we cite from 203. Not hypotheticals, but just seeking, again, to give the jury a sense of applications and how the agency then administers the regulation that it created and applies it in practice.

Emil Bove: And then the last issue that I mentioned that we would be seeking to cover with Mr. Smith is the "Press Exemptions." And that sort of has a basis in both the statute as well as the FEC's regulations. And we have also cited an advisory opinion in our request to charge that, alternatively, we would have Mr. Smith describe, again, just to give the jury a little bit of content around these terms.

Emil Bove: And I say that, and make this whole proffer with a little bit of concern that we don't want to be treading on your Honor's legal instructions. These are things that, coming into the trial, based on the in limine ruling, we had hoped to do through Mr. Smith. Now, you have these two competing jury instructions and so there is a little bit of tension here, and so we wanted to --

Juan Merchan: So you believe that the biggest impetus to this is to ask this Court about -- to argue that we now have two competing instructions, not the facts of the case or that the testimony has changed, just the request for the instructions?

Emil Bove: The reason that I'm making the proffer, your Honor, if the instructions had not come in, in the way that they had, meaning that if the parties were not in agreement at least with respect to the question of should the Court give instructions about FECA and these terms, we understand -- we think we understand what your Honor's in limine ruling says and we were going to abide by that through Mr. Smith.

Emil Bove: We are now making this proffer to your Honor so that everybody sort of has eyes wide open coming into Monday, when I think it's very possible this testimony could come in, that there is a little bit of tension right now between the pending request and what we would cover from -- through Mr. Smith. We are sensitive to that, and we don't want to have him up on the stand and give the impression that we are encroaching on your Honor's province.

Juan Merchan: Thank you.

Matthew Colangelo: Your Honor, I think 95 percent of the proffered testimony that was just described flies directly in the face of your extremely clear March 18th Order, which expressly said that Mr. Smith may not testify regarding the interpretation and application of Federal Campaign Finance Laws. You specifically held that he could identify general definitions, but not interpretation or application.

Matthew Colangelo: So as to each of the three terms of art in the Federal Campaign Finance Law that Mr. Bove just described, "For The Purpose of Influencing," "Irrespective of the Candidacy," and "Press Exemption," I think he just walked your Honor through a very long list of Federal Case Law, Supreme Court and D.C. Circuit Case Law, as well as Agency Advisory Opinions and Agency Adjudications interpreting those terms.

Matthew Colangelo: That is -- that kind of testimony from an expert is precisely the reason that there is a general and broadly followed prohibition on testimony by an expert witness on legal matters. And, your Honor, I think there are two compounding problems here. One is that, as Mr. Bove noted, we have also retained an expert witness who, if necessary, would be prepared to testify as to the same issues.

Matthew Colangelo: But then -- and we anticipate that he would say, based on what we've seen in the defendant's briefing, that the way the defense is interpreting the application of those statutes is inconsistent with how the Agency and how Federal Courts have done the same. But then we've got three people telling the jury what the law is, when there should be only one.

Matthew Colangelo: It should be your Honor exclusively instructing the jury on how the law applies. I mean, by analogy this would be like calling an expert witness to opine on whether the intent to defraud in the Penal Law definition does or does not -- is or is not limited to a pecuniary financial motive only. That's a brief -- we have briefed it. It's identified in the charge.

Matthew Colangelo: Your Honor has ruled on it. And that should be the end of it. The -- in fact, the very fact that this is a contested legal issue in the parties proposed instructions to the jury is even more reason why this should be resolved through argument before your Honor at pre-charge conference, not something that we should be putting in expert testimony -- expert testimony to discuss.

Matthew Colangelo: I think there are two other problems. First, and unless I'm missing it somewhere, the possibility of any testimony on the "Press Exemption" has never been included in any of the defense's disclosures regarding this witness, either before or after your Honor's motion in limine. So there is a serious notice problem with the "Press Exemption" proposal from the outset.

Matthew Colangelo: And then there is a broader notice problem, your Honor, which is that it's, as you know, dating back to last November, we tried for months to compel the defendant to disclose reciprocal discovery, including this expert testimony. We had to move the Court to compel reciprocal discovery in November. Your Honor granted that motion.

Matthew Colangelo: We didn't get the defense expert disclosure until January, and then the entire point of pretrial notice of proffered expert testimony is so the parties can prepare. We filed a motion in limine to exclude their expert testimony. Your Honor largely granted it. And we have prepared a potential rebuttal witness based on the language in your Honor's -- the Court's March 18th Order.

Matthew Colangelo: So to expand Mr. Smith's testimony at this point, just a few days before he may take the stand, presents a significant notice problem as well because our witness, in reliance on the Court's Order, we have not prepared him to talk about the facts about a D.C. Circuit case or the Orloski case or the Buckley versus the Valeo Supreme Court decision or how it applies.

Matthew Colangelo: So, your Honor, what Mr. Bove just described is totally outside and way beyond both what your Honor already ruled and any recognized exception to the general prohibition on legal testimony from an expert.

Emil Bove: We are not seeking to have three people at this trial instruct the jury about these issues, Judge, and that's exactly why I'm raising this -- why we're raising this right now, which is that the changed circumstance, from our perspective, is: I don't think there was a -- to our understanding, there was not an agreement prior to the start of this trial that your Honor would provide instructions to the jury regarding these issues.

Emil Bove: And, as you noted, there is still -- it's still not clear that the Court will. Judge, as a matter of just basic fairness, given the way that the People have now structured their theory of the case, the jury has to be provided instructions one way or another -- or I will say information, one way or another, about how to apply these principles.

Emil Bove: And so, what I have proffered is from our standpoint what I think are the very basics and the bare minimum that would be required for the jury to make an analysis of whether or not any of these things were unlawful contributions, which is a necessary showing here, at least that there was a conspiracy with that intent.

Emil Bove: I think we've been clear in pretrial motion practice and from the start that we don't think this jury here should be evaluating a FECA violation. We understand that before your Honor we've lost that fight. What we're saying now is that just basic fairness requires that they understand what the principles are in a fair way.

Emil Bove: And I think on the "Press Exemption" question in particular, I don't think there could be any reasonable dispute that that was absolutely central to both AMI's defense and the FEC's analysis of whether or not there was a campaign contribution both in the Non-Prosecution Agreement and in the Conciliation Agreement.

Emil Bove: And so --

Juan Merchan: People, anything else?

Matthew Colangelo: Yes, your Honor. Just two quick points and one to correct the record. My recollection is that Ms. Necheles said to your Honor at a bench conference last week, before any of the proposed jury instructions were in, that they intended to raise with your Honor, to question what their expert would be permitted to testify to. So I'm not sure that we can credit the characterization that this proffer and these instructions are necessitated by differences of opinion regarding the law in the proposed jury instructions.

Matthew Colangelo: And then, second, on the press exemption, as you know, your Honor, we haven't yet responded to the submission that the defense put in the other day. I'm not sure, as I stand here right now, that we will oppose the exclusion of the language in the charge to define the "Press Exemption," but the "Press Exemption" is why this entire undertaking is way beyond what any witness should testify to. The statutes and the regulations combined contain about 20 words of texts on the "Press Exemption." That entire concept is developed almost entirely through additional case law in courts and through agency application.

Matthew Colangelo: So, it's exactly the kind of thing that has been developed through the adjudicative and agency determination process and that the parties can discuss with you and that you should decide, your Honor, not an expert, certainly not competing experts instructing the jury.

Juan Merchan: All right. Thank you. Mr. Blanche, just give me a second, all right.

Todd Blanche: Yes, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: I don't think that the fact that each of you has submitted proposed jury charges necessarily changes my ruling or my decision to the motions in limine. To direct your attention specifically to the area that dealt with this, I direct your attention to Pages 1, 2 and 3 of the Court's decision. And I will read from the very last, next to last paragraph of the Court's decision: "The People's motion is granted to the extent that Smith may not testify as a lay fact witness, offer opinion testimony regarding the interpretation and application of Federal Campaign Finance Laws and how they relate to the facts in the instant matter, nor may Smith testify or offer an opinion as to whether the alleged conduct in this case does or does not constitute a violation of the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA). However, Smith will be permitted to testify generally as to the following: General background as to what the Federal Election Campaign Commission is, background as to who makes up the FEC, what the FEC's function is, what laws, if any, the FEC is responsible for enforcing, and general definitions and terms that relate directly to this case, such as, for example, campaign contribution.

Juan Merchan: As I listen to your presentation, Mr. Bove, it sounds to me like what you are asking is that I enlarge this decision quite a bit. When I hear you use words like "interpretation," "past decisions," "advisory opinions," that does sound an awful lot like what would normally be called opinions on the law. And, in fact, you used the term, "a battle of the experts." The only reason we would get into "a battle of the experts" is if your expert got on the stand and testified as to some sort of expert opinion not only about FECA, but possibly the law and then the People would put on their expert to rebut that, and then I would have to instruct the jury.

Juan Merchan: We are definitely not going to go there. What I'm going to do, in fairness to you, because I would like to digest both submissions further, I will take some time this weekend to do that, to read and study both sets of submissions. I would also like to read the minutes from what has just happened here. But until you hear differently from me, my ruling has not changed.

Juan Merchan: It's going to be limited to the very, very general definitions and very general background information. I also do agree with the People that they had asked for a very long period of time for disclosure and notice regarding the expert witness, and despite the repeated efforts to get that, it didn't come until, finally, very late in the game.

Juan Merchan: It was offered, but in a manner to suggest that the witness would actually testify as a fact witness, and you know what my ruling was on that, an expert can't testify as a fact witness because they don't know the facts of the case. So, at that point, the purpose of your expert was greatly diminished. Again, in fairness to you, I will consider your arguments.

Juan Merchan: I will go back and reread the submissions, but until and unless you hear differently from me, my ruling has not changed. If there is any question as to what the ruling is, again, go back to Pages 1, 2 and 3.

Emil Bove: Thank you, Judge. That's understood.

Juan Merchan: Sure. What else? Nothing else from either side?

Todd Blanche: No.

Juan Merchan: Let's talk schedule. As we discussed a little bit, I'm doing everything possible to avoid big breaks between summations, jury charge, jury instructions and deliberations. I will try not to break up summations, if at all possible. And as we discussed in the robing room, the deliberations should follow immediately after the jury charge.

Juan Merchan: It's not ideal for there to be a big lapse in time between summations and the jury charge. So I'm trying to avoid that to the extent that I'm able. You asked me if we could possibly start early. I'm going to look into that and see if we could start early. I think that we can work a little bit late on some days, but unfortunately we can't work on Wednesday.

Juan Merchan: As of right now, we know that one of the alternates can only work until 1:00 on Thursday. I don't think that that's going to be a problem one way or the other. We will play it by ear and see how that plays out. How much more do you think you have of Mr. Cohen?

Todd Blanche: I think not a lot. I think -- I would say, I think I will be finished with cross Monday before the morning break.

Juan Merchan: All right. Any sense of how long the redirect might be?

Susan Hoffinger: No. But I would say under an hour, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: Okay. At this point, do you expect to call any other witnesses on the direct case?

Joshua Steinglass: No, Judge.

Juan Merchan: Other than the expert witness, that we just discussed at this point, do you expect to present a defense case?

Todd Blanche: We anticipate reaching a decision at least with respect to any potential rebuttal witness very soon, like today. And we will communicate that to the folks -- to the People and including the Court. If we do have any rebuttal witnesses, we do not anticipate that they would be long, at least on direct. I don't think it's necessarily -- well, I don't want to make commitments about the day on Monday, but it's certainly reasonable to believe that if, aside from Mr. Smith, that the witnesses will be able to get on and off on Monday.

Juan Merchan: And when you say "rebuttal witnesses," are you referring to the witnesses that we spoke about earlier today or something else?

Todd Blanche: The witnesses that we spoke about earlier.

Juan Merchan: All right. So it sounds like we might possibly be done with the presentation of evidence on Monday.

Todd Blanche: I was not speaking about President Trump, obviously.

Juan Merchan: Right.

Todd Blanche: So that's another decision that we need to think through.

Juan Merchan: Right. There is a possibility that we will be done with the presentation of evidence on Monday. And if that happens, we will have our pre-charge conference on Monday. Please be prepared to begin summations on Tuesday, if we do wrap it up on Monday. Of course, you will see my instructions before you deliver your summations.

Juan Merchan: I will get them to you with as much notice as I can probably get them to you. I will make every effort to get both summations in in one day. That means working early/working late. If push comes to shove, I might have to break one of the summations over to the next day, which I hate to do. Anything else, as far as scheduling?

Juan Merchan: I am open to your suggestions. All right. Thank you.

Joshua Steinglass: Thank you.

Todd Blanche: Thank you, your Honor.

Note: [Whereupon, at this time, the matter was adjourned to Monday, May 20, 2024 at 9:30 a.m.]
