Court Clerk: Calling People of the State of New York versus Donald J. Trump, Indictment Number 71543 of 2023. Appearances. Starting with the People.

Joshua Steinglass: For the People, Assistant District Attorneys Joshua Steinglass, Susan Hoffinger, Matthew Colangelo, Becky Mangold, Christopher Conroy and Katherine Ellis. Good morning, everyone.

Juan Merchan: Good morning, People.

Todd Blanche: Good morning, your Honor. Todd Blanche for President Trump, who is seated to my left. I'm joined by Emil Bove, Kendra Wharton and Susan Necheles.

Juan Merchan: All right. Good morning, counsel. Good morning, Mr. Trump. Is there anything that we need to go over before we call a witness?

Joshua Steinglass: Yes, please. May we approach?

Juan Merchan: Sure.

Note: [At Sidebar.]

Juan Merchan: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: A couple of things, Judge. First of all, we had indicated that, potentially, that we would call another witness, that was going to be another book publisher, but we've decided that we really don't need to do that. So, Mr. Cohen will be the last witness. Related to that, I don't know how long Mr. Blanche's cross-examination will be, but I think that it's highly likely that we will get to the defense case, such as it is, on Thursday.

Joshua Steinglass: And we don't know who the defense witnesses are, except for an expert witness and potentially Mr. Trump. They've indicated that the only other witnesses that they intend to call are impeachment witnesses. Under 245.20(4)(b) we are entitled to know that at the end of whatever witness' testimony they are seeking to impeach.

Joshua Steinglass: So I understand that we haven't gotten there yet with Michael Cohen, but if there are any other impeachment witnesses that they intend to call to impeach one or other of our witnesses, we would like to know who those witnesses are. I think we're entitled to know who they are. Also, for planning purposes, we are entitled to have our potential rebuttal expert present for any expert testimony that they may proffer on their case.

Joshua Steinglass: And so, we would like to know when the expert will testify SO that we can make -- our expert is not local, SO we can make travel arrangements, SO that we don't have to have an unnecessary delay.

Juan Merchan: Okay.

Todd Blanche: All fair. We do not have any rebuttal witnesses as of now.

Juan Merchan: You don't have any?

Todd Blanche: We do not have any rebuttal witnesses as of now, pending the testimony of Mr. Cohen. I believe the cross will continue until the end of the day Thursday. If it even finishes, it will be very near the end of the day and presumably there will be redirect. As for our expert, we have communicated with him and expect him to be here over the weekend.

Todd Blanche: But whether we call him depends, in part, on the charge -- we submitted the charge, just this morning, SO I know you haven't read it yet. And so, what we would hope to be able to do is to at least have some discussion about that before we begin our case, presumably, on Monday. Because, depending on the ruling, we may not call him.

Juan Merchan: That's a little tricky. I have to go back and read the CPL, I believe the pre-charge conference, while it comes before summation --

Todd Blanche: Yes.

Juan Merchan: -- I think normally it comes at the end of the case. So you are kind of basing your evidence on what I decide as far as charges, and we may not know a final decision until we have the pre-charge conference.

Todd Blanche: Well, maybe I should rephrase. We -- if we can have an opportunity to argue or discuss what we anticipate our expert will testify to, get a ruling from the Court, your Honor already ruled, but there was some -- we believe, given where we are now, we at least need to address it again. So maybe it's not a charge conference.

Juan Merchan: Fine. We can do that.

Todd Blanche: My point is, I think they're travelling over the weekend. And as far as their expert, I don't believe that we would have him take the stand before Monday.

Juan Merchan: And do you have any indication whether your client is going to testify?

Todd Blanche: No.

Juan Merchan: No determination yet?

Todd Blanche: No.

Susan Hoffinger: And you also gave us notice of Alan Garten.

Todd Blanche: No, we don't anticipate the calling of Alan Garten.

Juan Merchan: So, if I understand you correctly, your only witness on defense, that you know of right now, is the expert possibly?

Todd Blanche: Correct.

Juan Merchan: And maybe not.

Todd Blanche: And maybe not. Honestly, Judge, depending on how that conversation goes, because of the limited nature of his testimony, we may not call him.

Juan Merchan: Okay.

Todd Blanche: And we will, obviously, let them know to save the flight of their expert.

Juan Merchan: Well, we can certainly have that conversation to assist you in making your decision.

Todd Blanche: Absolutely, sure.

Susan Hoffinger: One other quick issue. We gave notice to defense counsel on Sunday of incidents that we intended to seek to admit with Mr. Cohen. There were -- defense counsel has not objected to any of them, but with respect to two, indicated that they would be seeking a limiting instruction. Those are two exhibits, one which is Mr. Cohen's attorney's letter in response to an FEC complaint and Mr. Cohen's public statement in response to an FEC complaint.

Susan Hoffinger: And they've asked for a limiting instruction, I guess, along the lines of the prior instruction that your Honor gave. We do have a draft of that instruction. It's not going to come up just yet, but a little bit later today, but we thought it made sense to perhaps go over it now.

Juan Merchan: Have you had a chance to review it?

Susan Hoffinger: No. I just gave it to defense.

Juan Merchan: Okay.

Todd Blanche: I need to do look it.

Juan Merchan: Once you look at it, and if you agree, to please let me know and also let me know when you want me to give it.

Todd Blanche: Also, your Honor, assuming that Mr. Cohen testifies this morning around his guilty plea for FECA, we would ask your Honor to give that limiting instruction. And I think we have a copy of it.

Juan Merchan: No, I have a copy of it.

Todd Blanche: Thank you.

Susan Hoffinger: Thank you.

Note: [Sidebar concluded.]

Juan Merchan: All right. May we get the witness, please.

Court Reporter: Witness entering.

Note: [Continued direct examination by Susan Hoffinger.]

Susan Hoffinger: Good morning, Mr. Cohen.

Michael Cohen: Good morning.

Susan Hoffinger: When we left off yesterday, we were talking about your meetings with Mr. Trump and Mr. Weisselberg concerning the plan for the reimbursements. Do you remember that?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Susan Hoffinger: I would like to please put up People's 39 in evidence.

Note: [Displayed.]

Susan Hoffinger: Do you recognize that email, Mr. Cohen?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Susan Hoffinger: Would you read it for the jury, please?

Michael Cohen: It's an email from Jeff McConney to me saying: "Mike" I'm sorry, on February 6th of 2017: "Mike, just a reminder to get me the invoice you spoke to Allen about. Thanks, Jeff. "

Susan Hoffinger: And just as a reminder, what was Jeffrey McConney's job at the time?

Michael Cohen: Controller.

Susan Hoffinger: And who did you report to?

Michael Cohen: Allen Weisselberg.

Susan Hoffinger: And I think you mentioned yesterday that Mr. Weisselberg had discussed with you the invoices that you should send for the reimbursement payments?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And, at the point when you received this email, did you send the invoices right away or a little bit later?

Michael Cohen: A little bit later.

Susan Hoffinger: Let me direct your attention now to a few days later, February 8th.

Susan Hoffinger: Thank you. You can take that down.

Susan Hoffinger: February 8th of 2017. Did you visit the White House on that day?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: And why -- while you were visiting the White House, did you have a private conversation with then President Trump?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: First, where did the conversation take place?

Michael Cohen: In the Oval Office.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you discuss in the Oval Office the reimbursement payments that were going to be made to you?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Can you tell the jury a bit about that conversation?

Michael Cohen: So I was sitting with President Trump and he asked me if I was okay. He asked me if I needed money, and I said, no, all good. He said, because I can get a check. And I said, no. I said, I'm okay. He said, ummm, all right, just make sure you deal with Allen.

Susan Hoffinger: Did he say anything about anything that would be forthcoming?

Michael Cohen: Excuse me?

Susan Hoffinger: Did he say anything about what would be forthcoming to you?

Michael Cohen: Yes. It would be a check for January and February

Susan Hoffinger: And so, at that point in time, you had not yet been reimbursed for the payments that you made to Stormy Daniels?

Michael Cohen: No, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you take any photos commemorating your visit to the White House?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: Why did you do that?

Michael Cohen: Visiting the White House.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we put up People S 253 in evidence, please.

Note: [Displayed.]

Susan Hoffinger: Do you recognize that photo, Mr. Cohen?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Susan Hoffinger: And can you tell the jurors when you took that photo and where you were?

Michael Cohen: On the same day, and that's in the briefing room right outside of the Oval Office.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you take that photo before you met with President Trump or after you met with him?

Michael Cohen: No, ma'am, after.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, did you also put a page in your electronic calendar indicating that you had a meeting with the President of the United States on that day?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: And do you always put meetings and appointments in your electronic calendar?

Michael Cohen: No, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Why did you put one in that day?

Michael Cohen: So if -- to commemorate seeing President Trump at the White House.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we put up now, please, People's 254 in evidence.

Note: [Displayed.]

Susan Hoffinger: And blow it up just a little bit. Thank you.

Note: [Displayed.]

Susan Hoffinger: Do you recognize that calendar entry saying "Meeting with POTUS?"

Michael Cohen: I do.

Susan Hoffinger: What does POTUS stand for?

Michael Cohen: President of the United States.

Susan Hoffinger: And is that an exact copy of your electronic calendar, that appointment?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am, it is.

Susan Hoffinger: You can take that down.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, about a week after your meeting with President Trump at the White House, did Mr. McConney send you another email reminding you about the invoices?

Michael Cohen: He did.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we put up People's 37A in evidence, please.

Note: [Displayed.]

Susan Hoffinger: And can we go to Page 3 of the email from --

Susan Hoffinger: Can you make that a little bit bigger.

Note: [Displayed.]

Susan Hoffinger: Now, can you -- is this a response that you see on your screen to the prior email that we saw from Mr. McConney reminding you to send the invoices that you had spoken to Allen about?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: And would you read that for the jury and just the date and who it's from and to?

Michael Cohen: So this is from me to Jeff McConney, on February 14th, of 2017, regarding two dollar signs. "Jeff, sorry for the delay, and thank you for the reminder. Please have the monthly checks for January and February made payable to Michael D. Cohen, Esquire and sent to hope you are well and see you soon. "

Susan Hoffinger: And you didn't reference invoices here, just that they should send you the checks?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Susan Hoffinger: Why is that?

Michael Cohen: Because there was no need. There was no invoice.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we scroll up now to Mr. McConney's response to Mr. Cohen's email.

Note: [Displayed.]

Susan Hoffinger: Do you want to read that?

Michael Cohen: That's from Jeff McConney to me on February 14th of 2017. "Mike, please send me invoices SO I can have the checks cut. Thanks, Jeff."

Susan Hoffinger: Can we now put up Mr. Cohen's response to that email.

Note: [Displayed.]

Michael Cohen: From me to Jeff. Again, Tuesday, February 14th, regarding the two dollar signs. "Jeff, please remind me of the monthly amount?"

Susan Hoffinger: At that point, had you -- did you not have -- why were you asking for the monthly amount?

Michael Cohen: I actually didn't remember it. I didn't have a copy of the document that I had worked on with Allen Weisselberg and then presented to Mr. Trump.

Susan Hoffinger: If you had a Retainer Agreement, would it have had a monthly amount in it?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: But there was no Retainer Agreement?

Michael Cohen: No, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we put up Mr. McConney's response for Mr. Cohen.

Note: [Displayed.]

Michael Cohen: From Jeff McConney to me. In response: "35,000 per month."

Susan Hoffinger: Thank you.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, can we show Page 2.

Note: [Displayed.]

Susan Hoffinger: Mr. Cohen's response to invoice.

Susan Hoffinger: And can you describe for the jury, what's on the screen?

Michael Cohen: This is my email to McConney -- Jeff, on the same day, February 14th of 2017. I created an invoice, put Michael D. Cohen Esquire. There was an address, dated February 14th. And I called the document invoice. I sent it to Allen Weisselberg, care of -- and I sent it by email, care of Donald J. Trump, 725 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York, 10022. Stating: "Dear Allen, pursuant to the Retainer Agreement, kindly remit payment for services rendered for the months of January and February, 2017." Then I indicate for January, 2017, $35,000 fee.

Michael Cohen: And for February, 2017, the same $35,000 amount. "Thank you. Michael Cohen.' "

Susan Hoffinger: And, thereafter, did you send monthly invoices, essentially similar, to this invoice?

Michael Cohen: Yes, I copied and pasted.

Susan Hoffinger: And was this invoice consistent with the directions that you had been given by Allen Weisselberg?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, the invoice here says "For services rendered." The date here is -- what is the date on this invoice?"

Michael Cohen: February 14th of 2017.

Susan Hoffinger: And does the invoice say that it's for not only services rendered in the month of January, but also services rendered for the month of February of 2017?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: And, in truth, was this invoice for any services that you had rendered for those two months as indicated pursuant to a Retainer Agreement?

Todd Blanche: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Overruled.

Michael Cohen: No, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: And the description of "pursuant to a Retainer Agreement," was that a truthful statement?

Michael Cohen: No, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: And for "services rendered," "was that a truthful statement?

Michael Cohen: No, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: What was the true purpose of this invoice and the subsequent invoices that you sent?

Michael Cohen: The reimbursement to me of the hush money fee along with the Red Finch and the bonus.

Susan Hoffinger: Was this invoice a false record?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you continue to submit similar false invoices through the month -- monthly, through the month of December of 2017 SO that you would receive those checks?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: And did each of those monthly invoices that you submitted make the same false representation that it was rendered -- it was for services rendered for the month in question pursuant to a Retainer Agreement?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: And on each of the occasions that you sent those invoices, who were they directed to?

Michael Cohen: Allen Weisselberg.

Susan Hoffinger: And how did you submit them to Mr. Weisselberg?

Michael Cohen: Via email.

Susan Hoffinger: And who were the emails to?

Michael Cohen: Allen Weisselberg.

Susan Hoffinger: Were they emailed to anyone else other than Mr. Weisselberg?

Michael Cohen: Maybe also to Jeff McConney on occasion.

Susan Hoffinger: And have you had an opportunity to review each of the 11 invoices and the accompanying emails that you submitted to Allen Weisselberg, and on some occasions also to Jeff McConney, that are contained in People's Exhibits 37 A through K?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: And, in truth, were any of those invoices that you submitted based on services performed for the months indicated pursuant to a Retainer Agreement?

Michael Cohen: No, ma'am They were for reimbursement.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we take a look, please -- actually, withdrawn.

Susan Hoffinger: In response to those 11 false invoices, similar to this one that you sent, did you receive seven checks in the year 2017 totaling $420, 000?

Michael Cohen: I'm sorry, how many checks?

Susan Hoffinger: Eleven. A total of 11 checks in the year 2017 totaling $420,000?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: And can we now put up People's Exhibit 4 in evidence.

Note: [Displayed.]

Susan Hoffinger: Can you tell the jury what this is, referring to Exhibit 4?

Michael Cohen: This is a check that was sent to me for $70,000, which was for the month of January of 2017 and for the month of February 2017, along with the stub that came with it.

Susan Hoffinger: So when you received this check, it had a stub attached to it?

Michael Cohen: One of the stubs.

Susan Hoffinger: And this was in response to the invoice that you sent that we just looked at, People's 37A?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: And I want to direct your attention to the check stub.

Susan Hoffinger: If you could blow up one of the check stubs.

Susan Hoffinger: It says "Retainer for January 1, 2017 through January 30th, 2017, and retainer for February 1, 2017 through February 28th, 2017." Again, was there a retainer -- was this a retainer for those months?

Michael Cohen: No, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: And was the check -- were the descriptions here on this check stub false?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And, again, there was no Retainer Agreement, is that right?

Susan Hoffinger: Do you recognize the signatures on the check?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Whose do you recognize them to be?

Michael Cohen: The one on the top, I believe, is Eric Trump's, and the one on the bottom is Allen Weisselberg.

Susan Hoffinger: And who is the check from? In other words, what account is it drawn on?

Michael Cohen: The check is drawn from Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust account.

Susan Hoffinger: And at the time, did you know who the beneficial owner was of the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Who was that?

Michael Cohen: Donald J. Trump.

Susan Hoffinger: Thank you. You can take that down. Can we now take a look at People's Exhibit 37B in evidence.

Note: [Displayed.]

Susan Hoffinger: And if we could blow up the top of that. Thank you.

Susan Hoffinger: Can you tell us the date of that invoice?

Michael Cohen: February 16th of 2017.

Susan Hoffinger: Take a look at the body of the invoice, and could you just let us know if that date at the top, February 16th, was a typo?

Michael Cohen: Yes, it is.

Susan Hoffinger: What was it meant to be?

Michael Cohen: March.

Susan Hoffinger: And could you -- can you please just read what's in the invoice?

Michael Cohen: Yes. I probably should have copied and pasted better. This is an email from me to Jeff McConney and CC' -- well, I should say as well as to Allen Weisselberg. And the body states: "Invoice." To Allen Weisselberg, care of Donald J. Trump, again at 725 Fifth Avenue. New York, New York 10022. "Dear Allen, pursuant to the Retainer Agreement, kindly remit payment for services rendered for the month of March, 2017." Then again stating: "March, 2017 $35,000. Thank you.

Michael Cohen: Yours "

Susan Hoffinger: And, in fact, was this payment for services rendered for the month of March pursuant to the Retainer Agreement?

Michael Cohen: No, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Was that invoice false?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Thank you.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we put up People's S Exhibit 7, please.

Note: [Displayed.]

Susan Hoffinger: Did you receive this check for $35,000 in response to that false invoice that we just saw in People's 37B?

Susan Hoffinger: And can we blow up, please, one of the attached stubs.

Note: [Displayed.]

Susan Hoffinger: And you notice it says "Retainer for March 1st through March 31st, 2017. " Was this, in fact, a retainer for that month?

Michael Cohen: No, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Was the description in this check stub a false statement?

Susan Hoffinger: Thank you.

Susan Hoffinger: We can take that down. Can we now put up People's 37C in evidence.

Note: [Displayed.]

Susan Hoffinger: Maybe blow it up a little bit.

Susan Hoffinger: And, Mr. Cohen, can you read it. The year and date?

Michael Cohen: The date is April 13th of 2017. It's to Allen Weisselberg. Care of Donald J. Trump, 725 Fifth Avenue. New York, New York 10022. "Dear Allen, pursuant to the Retainer Agreement, kindly remit payment for services rendered for the month of April, 2017." Again, it's showing: "April, 2017 $35,000. Thank you "

Susan Hoffinger: Does this invoice falsely state that it's payment for services rendered during the month of April pursuant to the Retainer Agreement?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Is that a false record?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we please take that down and put up People's Exhibit 10.

Note: [Displayed.]

Susan Hoffinger: Did you receive this check for $35,000 in response to that false invoice that we just saw, People's Exhibit 37C?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am. The check and the stub.

Susan Hoffinger: Thank you.

Susan Hoffinger: And can we just blow up the stub.

Note: [Displayed.]

Susan Hoffinger: And can you read what the description says?

Michael Cohen: The description states retainer 4/1 through 4/30 of 2017.

Susan Hoffinger: In truth, was that check paid to you as a retainer for that month of April 2017?

Michael Cohen: No, ma'am. Again, reimbursement.

Susan Hoffinger: And so, was the description on the check stub false?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we look at the signature on the check, please.

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Note: [Displayed.]

Susan Hoffinger: Do you recognize that signature?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Susan Hoffinger: And were you able to recognize it based on your experience working for him all those years?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: We can take that down. Thank you.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, did you receive a total of eight more monthly checks for $35,000, each signed by Mr. Trump, corresponding to the monthly false invoices that you sent contained in People's 37D through K?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: And those eight monthly checks that you received, were they all accompanied by check stubs that falsely stated they were retainers for the months in question?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And were any of those checks, in fact, for work during the months described in those check stubs?

Michael Cohen: No, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we take a look, please, at 37D.

Susan Hoffinger: Can you read that invoice, please, for the jury?

Susan Hoffinger: And did that falsely state that it was payment for services rendered in the month of May pursuant to a Retainer Agreement?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we please put up People's Exhibit 13.

Note: [Displayed.]

Susan Hoffinger: Did you receive that check for $35,000 in response to the false invoice that we just saw for People's 37D?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we pull up one of the check stubs, please.

Note: [Displayed.]

Susan Hoffinger: Does that check stub say Retainer, May 1st -- does it say "May, 2017?"

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: I apologize, it's hard for me to read it from here. And, again, was this check paid to you as a retainer for that month?

Note: [Displayed.]

Susan Hoffinger: Can you make it any bigger. Thank you.

Michael Cohen: This invoice was for the month of June. It states: June 16th of 2017. Invoice. Mr. Allen Weisselberg, care of Donald J. Trump. 725 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York, 10022. "Dear Allen, pursuant to the Retainer Agreement, kindly remit payment for services rendered for the month of May, 2017 and June, 2017." It listed, again, "May, 2017 $35,000" and "June of 2017, $35,000. Thank you. "

Susan Hoffinger: Now, you listed two months in that. Is that because you had not yet received the check for May?

Michael Cohen: That's correct. I believe it was lost.

Susan Hoffinger: And does this invoice falsely state that it's for services rendered during the months of May and June pursuant to a Retainer Agreement?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Thank you.

Susan Hoffinger: You can take that down and now put up People's Exhibit 16.

Susan Hoffinger: Thank you, yes.

Michael Cohen: Yes, it says "Retainer."

Susan Hoffinger: And was that description on the check stub false?

Susan Hoffinger: Mr. Cohen, can you read that invoice?

Michael Cohen: December 1, 2017. Invoice for Mr. Allen Weisselberg. Care of Donald J. Trump, 725 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York, 10022. "Dear Allen, pursuant to the Retainer Agreement, kindly remit payment for services rendered for the month of December, 2017. Thank you. "

Susan Hoffinger: And does that invoice falsely state that you are seeking payment for services rendered for the month of December, 2017 pursuant to the Retainer Agreement?

Michael Cohen: Because now I had been reimbursed the $420,000.

Susan Hoffinger: Thank you.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we please pull up People's Exhibit 34 now.

Susan Hoffinger: So is the description on the check stub false?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Was this the last check that you received from Mr. Trump or anyone at The Trump Organization?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Why was that?

Michael Cohen: Again, it was because the full reimbursement of the $420,000 had been paid.

Susan Hoffinger: Thank you.

Susan Hoffinger: You can take that down. Can we now pull up People's Exhibit 42 in evidence.

Note: [Displayed.]

Susan Hoffinger: Can we scroll down just a little bit SO that Mr. Cohen can recognize this exhibit.

Note: [Displayed.]

Susan Hoffinger: Mr. Cohen, have you had a chance to review the 11 checks that are contained in here, in this exhibit totaling $420,000?

Michael Cohen: I have.

Susan Hoffinger: Were all 11 checks received by you and deposited and the amounts reflected in the checks paid out to you?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: We can take that down. Thank you very much.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, after the last check was sent to you in December of 2017, I think you mentioned, you never received any other checks from Mr. Trump or from his Trust, is that right?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Susan Hoffinger: Or from The Trump Organization?

Michael Cohen: Also correct.

Susan Hoffinger: I want to talk to you a little bit about the work that you did in 2017, any work that you did with respect to your role as Personal Attorney and Personal Counsel to President Trump. Did you do, in the year 2017, any work for Mr. Trump or for his wife Melania Trump?

Michael Cohen: Minimal.

Susan Hoffinger: And can you just give us some examples of the minimal work that you did in 2017 for them?

Michael Cohen: There was a matter that dealt with an individual by the name of Summer Zervos. I was working with Marc Kasowitz on that, and SO I had spoken with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office and provided him some documents that Mr. Kasowitz had given to me to pass along. As far as Melania, I think it had to do with some trademarks or maybe even a Madame Tussauds Agreement.

Susan Hoffinger: So, let's break both of those down. In terms of the work that you did for Mrs. Trump related to Madame Tussauds or the trademark, what was the -- can you characterize the extent of that work for Mrs. Trump?

Michael Cohen: I reviewed an Agreement that Madame Tussauds sent to her that was to create her likeness and image for their museum.

Susan Hoffinger: Was it a substantial amount of time that you spent on that?

Michael Cohen: No, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you send a bill or an invoice to Mr. Trump or to The Trump Organization for that work?

Michael Cohen: No, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Why not?

Michael Cohen: Well, one, I -- I didn't expect to be paid on it. But, it wasn't enough work to have me send an invoice.

Susan Hoffinger: And you mentioned Summer Zervos. Who was handling that matter, substantially, for Mr. Trump?

Michael Cohen: Marc Kasowitz.

Susan Hoffinger: So that was an outside attorney, not yourself?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Susan Hoffinger: How would you characterize the amount of work that you did generally on that matter, if any?

Michael Cohen: Very minimal.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you ever bill Mr. Trump or The Trump Organization for that minimal work that you said that you did on that?

Michael Cohen: No, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Why not?

Michael Cohen: Again, it wasn't any substantial work. Mr. Kasowitz was actually doing the work on that. Plus I didn't t expect to be paid.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, from time to time, did -- withdrawn. From time to time, did you receive some emails from Alan Garten, who was the General Counsel of The Trump Organization, about particular matters here and there that he might want you to look into?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you consider that work that he sent you legal work?

Michael Cohen: No.

Susan Hoffinger: And regardless of what type of work it was, in terms of things that he sent you, what was the extent of any work that you did on those matters?

Michael Cohen: Also minimal.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you send a bill or an invoice either to Mr. Trump or to The Trump Organization for that work?

Michael Cohen: No, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: And why not?

Michael Cohen: Because, the same reasons as stated, I didn't expect to be paid and it was very minimal work.

Susan Hoffinger: If you had to characterize or estimate the number of hours that you spent in the year 2017 doing any sort of work, legal or these quasi-legal matters, what would be the total number of hours that you would estimate?

Michael Cohen: Less than ten.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, did you bill for any of those matters?

Michael Cohen: No, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Was the $420,000 that you received from Mr. Trump and from the Revocable Trust, did that have anything to do with the minimal amount of work that you did for Mr. Trump in 2017?

Michael Cohen: No, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, did you continue -- for a period of months in 2018, did you continue to hold the title of Personal Attorney or Personal Counsel to President Trump?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you do any legal work for Mr. Trump in 2018?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Can you describe, generally, for the jury, the type of work that you did in 2018?

Michael Cohen: As a result of the Stormy Daniels matter and her electing to go public, Mr. Trump wanted an action to be filed in -- an arbitration action to be filed against her for the breach of the Non-Disclosure Agreement. And so I was contacted by Eric Trump, as well as I spoke to Mr. Trump regarding how to go forward with this arbitration proceeding.

Susan Hoffinger: Were you directed to work with outside counsel on that issue?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Who was that?

Michael Cohen: That would be Larry Rosen.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you work on that matter with Larry Rosen in the year 2018?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Comparatively, did you do more work in 2018, more legal work in 2018 for Mr. Trump, or more in 2017?

Michael Cohen: It would be more in 2018.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you get paid anything in 2018 from Mr. Trump or The Trump Organization?

Michael Cohen: No, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you bill for any of the work that you did for Mr. Trump in 2018?

Michael Cohen: No, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, I wanted to go back to something that you said, that you testified about yesterday, and that was monetizing the title of Personal Attorney or Personal Counsel to the President. In 2017 and 2018, did that title assist you in getting other clients?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: And was that your plan all along for seeking that title, and that was, to be able to attract clients based on your role?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: In 2017 and 2018, approximately how many clients did you have, doing work for them?

Michael Cohen: Five.

Susan Hoffinger: And what kind of work, generally, did you do for those clients?

Michael Cohen: Consulting, advisory.

Susan Hoffinger: Was there any legal work involved in any of those clients during the year 2018?

Michael Cohen: No, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, over the course of 2017 and 2018, approximately how much money in total did you earn from those clients that you worked for?

Michael Cohen: Approximately $4 million.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you also, as a result, have an agreement with a law firm here in New York named Squire Patton Boggs?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: Can you explain a little bit about that?

Michael Cohen: Well, I was contacted by one of the managing partners of the firm and they were interested in having me on their letterhead because of the title, "Personal Attorney to the President, as well as being able to levy my contacts to help them to generate business. And I created a working relationship with them, an of counsel relationship with them.

Susan Hoffinger: And approximately how much did Squire Patton Boggs pay you?

Michael Cohen: It was bifurcated, the Agreement. It was half a million dollars, and the first half a million dollars of income that was generated would come to me, everything thereafter until they received their 1 million back would go to them.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you also have an office there at Squire Patton Boggs?

Michael Cohen: Two offices. I had one here in Manhattan and one in Washington, D.C.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, approximately, how long did you hold the title of Personal Counsel or Personal Attorney to the President?

Michael Cohen: Approximately 15 months.

Susan Hoffinger: And during the time when you were Personal Counsel to the President, did you continue to try to protect him?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: And during the time that you served as Personal Counsel to the President, did you continue to lie for him?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Why did you do that?

Michael Cohen: Out of loyalty and in order to protect him.

Susan Hoffinger: And at the time he was President, is that right?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: And had he already announced that he was going to be running again for President in 2020?

Michael Cohen: He had stated so.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, I want to direct your attention to the Fall of 20 -- actually, the Spring and Fall 2017. During the time when you were still personal counsel to President Trump, around that time, did the House and Senate Intelligence Committees request that you provide them with information and appear before them and testify in connection with the Russia investigation?

Michael Cohen: They did.

Susan Hoffinger: And were you subpoenaed to provide testimony?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Describe, just briefly, what you understood those inquiries to be about?

Michael Cohen: It was about the Trump Tower Moscow deal and Russia connections to the campaign.

Susan Hoffinger: What, if any, pressure did you feel at the time that you were under in connection with that?

Michael Cohen: A tremendous amount of pressure. It was the first time I had ever been subpoenaed by Congress to come in to testify.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you have an attorney representing you at the time in connection with your statements and your testimony to Congress?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: And who was paying for that attorney?

Michael Cohen: The Trump Organization.

Susan Hoffinger: Was that important to you at the time that The Trump Organization was paying for your attorney?

Michael Cohen: Very much SO.

Susan Hoffinger: Was your attorney also part of something called a Joint Defense Agreement?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Can you explain a little bit to the jury what that is?

Michael Cohen: So the Joint Defense Agreement is when there is several different lawyers representing, obviously, different people and they are all working together for a common goal.

Susan Hoffinger: At the time, what, if anything, did you feel about wanting the power of the President to protect you in this matter?

Michael Cohen: I felt I needed it. It was extremely important to me.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you make false statements to Congress in 2017 in connection with the written statement that you submitted and your testimony?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: Generally, what did those false statements relate to?

Michael Cohen: They dealt with The Trump Tower Moscow real estate project, specifically the number of times that I claimed to have spoken to Mr. Trump about the project, as well as the time period for those conversations.

Susan Hoffinger: What, essentially, did you communicate to Congress in terms of the time period?

Michael Cohen: I told them that it was a truncated time period and that I had only spoken to Mr. Trump about this project three times.

Susan Hoffinger: And, in truth, how many times had you?

Michael Cohen: Ten times.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you also communicate to them that it was -- that those communications stopped at an earlier date than they actually did?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Why did you make those false statements to Congress?

Michael Cohen: Because I was staying on Mr. Trump's message that there was no Russia-Russia-Russia and, again, in coordination with the Joint Defense Team, that's what was preferred.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, let me direct your attention to the early months of 2018. Did you continue to lie about Mr. Trump's involvement in the Stormy Daniels payoff?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you continue to pressure other people, for example, like Keith Davidson, to lie about the payoffs to Karen McDougal and to Stormy Daniels?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Why did you do that?

Michael Cohen: In order to protect Mr. Trump.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we please put up People's Exhibit 181 in evidence.

Note: [Displayed.]

Susan Hoffinger: Now, in early -- do you see in front of you an article from the Wall Street Journal regarding the payoff to Stormy Daniels?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Just prior to this article coming out, did you learn from reporters for the Wall Street Journal that they were going to be running or publishing a story about the Stormy Daniels payoff?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: When the story came out, did you -- or was coming out, did you comment publicly regarding these allegations?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you comment to reporters?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: And to others?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: At the time, in early 2018, did you tell the truth about Mr. Trump's role in the payoff?

Michael Cohen: No, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you tell the truth about his involvement in the payoff and the fact that he had repaid you for the payments you made to Stormy Daniels?

Michael Cohen: No.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, did you continue to be in touch with President Trump during this time in early 2018?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: How, generally, did you reach him in early 2018?

Michael Cohen: I would reach him, generally, by contacting Madeleine Westerhout and expressed to Westerhout -- and expressed to her that I would like to speak to Mr. President or I would call him on his cell phone.

Susan Hoffinger: Who was Madeleine Westerhout at the time?

Michael Cohen: She was a White House Secretary for -- that basically sat outside Mr. Trump's -- outside the Oval Office.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, during this time period, did you discuss with President Trump the statements that you were going to be releasing publicly in early 2018, meaning, statements that he did not know or was not involved in the Stormy Daniels payoff?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: In substance, what did you tell him about the statements that you were going to be releasing or issuing about the Stormy Daniels matter?

Michael Cohen: That I had paid the money on his behalf without his knowledge because -- just because something isn't true doesn't mean that it can't hurt you, and that I did it.

Susan Hoffinger: And you did it without his knowledge, did you say?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: What, generally, did he -- how, generally, did he respond to you letting him know that?

Michael Cohen: Well, That's good. Good.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, in January of 2018, were you in contact with Keith Davidson about this article that was going to be coming out in the Wall Street Journal?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: What did you discuss with him?

Michael Cohen: How this statement -- how the story had gotten out. I was angered and I was concerned.

Susan Hoffinger: And what did you ask him to do in response?

Michael Cohen: Obtain a denial from Ms. Daniels.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we please put up People's Exhibit 255 in evidence.

Note: [Displayed.]

Susan Hoffinger: Do you recognize these text exchanges, Mr. Cohen, and who they are with?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Susan Hoffinger: Who were they with?

Michael Cohen: Let me see. Keith Davidson.

Susan Hoffinger: And can we take a look at the texts on January 10th of 2018.

Note: [Displayed.]

Susan Hoffinger: And perhaps you can read those for the jury.

Michael Cohen: It's from Keith Davidson to me. It's dated January 10th of 2018. "Wall Street Journal called Stormy. She didn't answer. They say they are running a story and have a deadline of tonight for her to comment. "

Susan Hoffinger: And can you read your response, please, to the jury?

Michael Cohen: I apologize. It's October 20th of 2018. My response to --

Susan Hoffinger: Actually, just to correct --

Michael Cohen: I'm sorry. It's October 20th.

Susan Hoffinger: I think the date is over on the left. Is it January 10th?

Michael Cohen: January 10th of 2018, yeah.

Susan Hoffinger: Well, okay. Thank you.

Michael Cohen: I apologize.

Susan Hoffinger: I'm sorry.

Michael Cohen: January 10th of 2018.

Susan Hoffinger: Thank you?

Michael Cohen: And then my response, January 10th of 2018, from me to Keith Davidson: "Write a strong denial comment for her like you did before."

Note: [Whereupon, Principal Court Reporter Susan Pearce-Bates relieved Senior Court Reporter Lisa Kramsky as the official court reporter.]

Note: [Continued direct examination by Susan Hoffinger]

Susan Hoffinger: Did you pressure Keith Davidson to have Stormy Daniels sign a denial?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Why did you do that?

Michael Cohen: To protect Mr. Trump.

Susan Hoffinger: And did Keith Davidson end up providing you with such a statement by Ms. Daniels?

Michael Cohen: He did.

Susan Hoffinger: Before we look at that, I want to follow up on one question I asked you about the Joint Defense Agreement. Was Mr. Trump and his lawyer also part of that Joint Defense Agreement?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am. They were.

Susan Hoffinger: And who was benefiting from the Joint Defense Agreement?

Todd Blanche: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Please approach.

Note: [Discussion is held at sidebar, on the record.]

Todd Blanche: Your Honor, the objection is because it calls for a legal conclusion. A Joint Defense Agreement is a formal agreement amongst lawyers. And so, asking who benefits from it, assuming he is going to say President Trump, that's just not consistent with what the Joint Defense Agreement is. Every Defendant in it --

Susan Hoffinger: I can ask a better question, which is: What was his understanding?

Juan Merchan: Okay.

Susan Hoffinger: Thank you.

Note: [Discussion at sidebar concluded, and the following occurred in open court.]

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Susan Hoffinger: Thank you.

Susan Hoffinger: Mr. Cohen, what was your understanding about who benefited from the Joint Defense Agreement?

Todd Blanche: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Overruled.

Michael Cohen: I believe several people would benefit, but certainly President Trump.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you understand that you also benefited?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, can we please put up People's 277 in evidence.

Note: [Displayed.]

Susan Hoffinger: We were discussing that you pressured Keith Davidson to have Ms. Daniels issue a statement. Do you remember that testimony?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Susan Hoffinger: And do you recognize this document?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Susan Hoffinger: What do you recognize it to be?

Michael Cohen: This is the statement that Keith Davidson had sent to me in regards to the denial that I requested him to send.

Susan Hoffinger: And when he -- after you received this from Mr. Davidson, who did you send it to?

Michael Cohen: I sent it to Hope Hicks, I believe.

Susan Hoffinger: Do you know when you sent it?

Michael Cohen: I am sorry. I sent it to The Wall Street Journal. I sent it to several people, but yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you know that this statement from Stormy Daniels was false?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, did you tell Mr. Trump that you were going to be getting or had gotten such a denial statement from Ms. Daniels?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Why did you tell him that?

Michael Cohen: Well, one, to get credit for expressing that I was continuing to ensure that he was protected, stay loyal and the other SO that I -- we can have this matter taken care of.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we please put up now People's 255 in evidence? And can we blow up the texts from January 17th of 2018?

Note: [Displayed.]

Susan Hoffinger: Now, Mr. Cohen, did you ask Mr. Daniels -- withdrawn. Did you ask Mr. Davidson to have Ms. Daniels appear on the Hannity Show, the Sean Hannity Show on Fox during this time?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: Why did you do that?

Michael Cohen: Because I wanted to continue to promote the statement that there was no relationship and that Trump had no involvement.

Susan Hoffinger: And can we scroll down to a few more of these text exchanges? You can stop there.

Note: [Displayed.]

Susan Hoffinger: After your text, can you read Keith Davidson's response?

Michael Cohen: Yes. His response to me is: She cannot. Don't today. She is flying to L.A. tomorrow. I'm trying to get her to commit for tomorrow.

Susan Hoffinger: And your response?

Michael Cohen: It's really important. Why?

Susan Hoffinger: Can we scroll down to the next one?

Michael Cohen: I didn t get a response, or the response I was looking for. So, I asked him to please call me: Can you call me, please? I still didn't hear from him so, I respond again: Please call me.

Susan Hoffinger: Then?

Michael Cohen: Then followed by: Anything? With a question mark. And his response finally to me: Was still trying.

Susan Hoffinger: And the next text.

Michael Cohen: And I then followed up and said: This is no good. We need her as -- by doing tomorrow. You just create another news circle instead of putting an end to this one. And then, again, I am asking him to please call me. And persistence: Come on. I still hadn t heard from him. I then respond: Let's forget tonight.

Michael Cohen: They would rather tomorrow SO they can promote the heck out of the show. Followed by me writing to Keith: Keith, the wise men all believe the story is dying and don't think it's smart for her to do any interviews. Let her do her thing but no interviews at all with anyone. His response to me: 100 percent.

Michael Cohen: I respond: Thanks Pal. As well as: Just no interviews or statements unless through you. He replies: Got it.

Susan Hoffinger: Did Ms. Daniels end up going on the Sean Hannity Show?

Michael Cohen: No, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we now put up People' 278 in evidence, please?

Note: [Displayed.]

Susan Hoffinger: Now, later in the month of January, January 30th of 2018, did you make more efforts to get Keith Davidson to have Stormy Daniels issue another denial statement?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Why did you do that?

Michael Cohen: Because despite what we thought was dying, the story dying, there were still persistent reporters that were looking into this. And I felt an official statement from her, another one, would be helpful to putting an end to it.

Susan Hoffinger: Do you also recall that around that same time there was some news that she might go on the Jimmy Kimmel Show?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And so, did you pressure Keith Davidson to have her sign this statement?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: In fact, did he provide that statement to you from Stormy Daniels?

Michael Cohen: He did.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you know at the time that this statement was false?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: How did you know?

Michael Cohen: Because I helped him craft it.

Susan Hoffinger: In addition, does the statement say that she was not paid any hush money?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: How do you know that she had been paid that money?

Michael Cohen: Because I am the one who paid it.

Susan Hoffinger: Thank you. You can take that down.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, at some point again in 2018, early 2018, did you receive a letter, a complaint letter, from the Federal Election Commission regarding your payment of $130,000 to Stormy Daniels?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you have an attorney prepare a letter on your behalf in response to that complaint?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: And what law firm and what lawyer?

Michael Cohen: That was from McDermott, Will and Emery. The attorney was Stephen Ryan.

Susan Hoffinger: And who was paying for McDermott, Will and Emery's work and for Stephen Ryan's time at the time?

Michael Cohen: The Trump Organization.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we show just to the witness, please, and to counsel and to the Court, People's Exhibit 201 for identification?

Note: [Displayed.]

Susan Hoffinger: Do you recognize that document, Mr. Cohen?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Susan Hoffinger: What do you recognize it to be?

Michael Cohen: This is the letter that was drafted by counsel, myself to the Federal Election Commission in response to what's identified as MUR7313. That's the Complaint Number.

Susan Hoffinger: And is that an exact copy of the letter that your attorney submitted on your behalf to the FEC?

Michael Cohen: It is.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you authorize him to submit that letter?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: The People offer, your Honor, People's Exhibit 201 in evidence.

Todd Blanche: No objection.

Juan Merchan: Accepted into evidence.

Note: [Document so received in evidence.]

Note: [Displayed.]

Susan Hoffinger: Can you read, please, the second paragraph of that letter for the jury?

Michael Cohen: In a private transaction in 2016 before the United States Presidential Election, Mr. Cohen used his own personal funds to facilitate a payment of $130,000 to Ms. Stephanie Clifford. Neither The Trump Organization, nor the Trump campaign was a party to the transaction with Ms. Clifford and neither reimbursed Mr. Cohen for the payment directly or indirectly.

Susan Hoffinger: Was that statement false or misleading?

Michael Cohen: Misleading.

Susan Hoffinger: And can you explain to the jury why it is misleading?

Michael Cohen: So, while crafting the statement, we elected to state neither The Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign was a party to the transaction. That is a true statement, but it's deceptive. It's misleading.

Susan Hoffinger: Can you explain why it's misleading?

Michael Cohen: Well, because it was neither The Trump Org., or the Trump campaign. It was the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust or Mr. Trump himself.

Susan Hoffinger: And you omitted that in the letter?

Michael Cohen: I omitted it.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you intend for it to be misleading?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Why?

Michael Cohen: In order to protect Mr. Trump. To stay on message. To demonstrate my continued loyalty.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you speak to Mr. Trump about the FEC Complaint when you received it in February of 2018?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: And did he approve, in substance, with your statement which would omit his involvement in the matter?

Michael Cohen: He did.

Susan Hoffinger: And did he approve your sending out such a response to the press as well?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we take a look at People's Exhibit 260 in evidence?

Note: [Displayed.]

Susan Hoffinger: Do you recognize what's contained in this exhibit, Mr. Cohen?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Susan Hoffinger: What is it?

Michael Cohen: These are text messages between myself and Maggie Haberman of The New York Times?

Susan Hoffinger: And when you say of The New York Times, who is Maggie Haberman?

Michael Cohen: She is a reporter for The New York Times.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you have her telephone numbers and emails in your phone contacts?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Except for the redactions here, is this an exact copy of some of the text communications you had with her on February 6th of 2018?

Michael Cohen: It is.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we blow up the text on February 6th of 2018?

Note: [Displayed.]

Susan Hoffinger: And, Mr. Cohen, can you read them?

Michael Cohen: So, this is from February 6th of 2018, from me to Maggie Haberman, stating: Big Boss just approved me responding to complaint and statement. Please start writing and I will call you soon.

Susan Hoffinger: Who is the, Big Boss, that you were referring to in that text with Maggie Haberman?

Michael Cohen: President Donald Trump.

Susan Hoffinger: What did you mean by this text?

Michael Cohen: That he approved the statement and that -- and my response to the complaint and asking her to start writing a story in regard to the denial.

Susan Hoffinger: And were you intending to provide her with the statement about the matter?

Michael Cohen: Yes. I was going to give it to her first SO she had the scoop.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you then also prepare a written statement for the press to be released in connection with that FEC Complaint?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And can we now please show just to the witness, counsel and to the Court, People's Exhibit 202 for identification.

Note: [Displayed.]

Susan Hoffinger: Do you recognize this document, Mr. Cohen?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Susan Hoffinger: What is it?

Michael Cohen: This is the statement that I was releasing to the press.

Susan Hoffinger: And is this an exact copy of the statement that you released publicly to the press around February 13th of 2018?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: I offer People's Exhibit 202 in evidence, your Honor.

Todd Blanche: No objection, Judge. We respectfully request the instruction with respect to the letter and the statement.

Juan Merchan: Why don't we introduce it into evidence? It is accepted into evidence.

Note: [Document SO received in evidence.]

Susan Hoffinger: And should we have him read it first and then the instruction?

Juan Merchan: Yes Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Thank you, your Honor.

Note: [Continued direct examination by Susan Hoffinger.]

Susan Hoffinger: Could you please read the first -- actually, the first line in the second paragraph?

Michael Cohen: I am Mr. Trump's long-time special counsel, and I have proudly served in that role for more than a decade.

Susan Hoffinger: Why did you write that line?

Michael Cohen: To validate the statement that I was going to be sending out that I wanted them to run with and because it was Mr. Trump.

Susan Hoffinger: And could you please read the paragraph that starts: In a private transaction?

Michael Cohen: In a private transaction in 2016, I used my own personal funds to facilitate a payment of $130,000 to Ms. Stephanie Clifford. Neither The Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign was a party to the transaction with Ms. Clifford and neither reimbursed me for the payment, either directly or indirectly. The payment to Ms. Clifford was lawful and was not a campaign contribution or a campaign expenditure by anyone.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, was that statement false?

Juan Merchan: Ms. Hoffinger. Mr. Blanche, is this the point you --

Todd Blanche: Oh, yes, Your Honor.

Juan Merchan: Jurors, you have just heard testimony that the Federal Election Commission, the FEC, conducted an investigation into the payment to Stormy Daniels and the responses thereto submitted by Michael Cohen and his attorney. This evidence was permitted to assist you, the jury, in assessing Michael Cohen's credibility and to help provide context of some of the surrounding events.

Juan Merchan: You may consider that testimony for those purposes only. Neither the fact of the FEC investigation nor the responses thereto constitute evidence of the Defendant's guilt, and you may not consider them in determining whether the Defendant is guilty or not guilty of the charged crimes.

Susan Hoffinger: Thank you, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: You are welcome.

Note: [Continued direct examination by Susan Hoffinger.]

Susan Hoffinger: Was the statement that you just read false or misleading?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And for the same reasons that you described concerning your lawyer's response to the FEC Complaint?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And there is an additional line here that you read that says --

Susan Hoffinger: Can you blow that up one more time?

Susan Hoffinger: There is an additional line at the bottom that says: The payment to Ms. Clifford was lawful and was not a campaign contribution or campaign expenditure by anyone. Was that a false statement?

Michael Cohen: It was my drawing a legal conclusion, which is inaccurate.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, can you read the second to last line in -- thank you -- in the next paragraph. Can you read that to us, please?

Michael Cohen: I do not plan to provide any further comment on the FEC matter or regarding Ms. Clifford.

Susan Hoffinger: And why did you write that?

Michael Cohen: Because I realized that once you send this to the press, that they are smarter than just to notice The Trump Organization or the Trump campaign. That they would ask additional questions such as: Well, did it come from Mr. Trump? Did it come from somebody else? And I wanted to just preface it to them: This is the statement you are going to get from me to run with and that I have no intentions to continue to comment on the matter.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we also just blow up the last line in the letter.

Note: [Displayed.]

Susan Hoffinger: And would you read that to the jury?

Michael Cohen: Just because something isn't true doesn't mean that it can t cause you harm or damage. I will always protect Mr. Trump.

Susan Hoffinger: And why did you write that?

Michael Cohen: Because it was a statement that validated what was in the second paragraph about me providing my own personal funds to facilitate the payment. And the last line: I will always protect Mr. Trump, was to validate that specific line.

Susan Hoffinger: Thank you. You can take that down.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, around that same time that you released that statement -- that you were going to be releasing that statement to the press publicly, did you also provide that statement to someone named Jay Sekulow?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: Who was Jay Sekulow at the time?

Michael Cohen: He was representing Mr. Trump.

Susan Hoffinger: And is he an attorney?

Michael Cohen: He is.

Susan Hoffinger: And explain why you sent that public statement that you were going to send out to Mr. Sekulow?

Michael Cohen: I was referred to Mr. Sekulow, actually, by Sean Hannity to speak about this FEC Complaint. And I was instructed to by Mr. Trump, to keep in touch with Jay Sekulow because he was in contact with Mr. Trump.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we take a look now, just for the witness, the Court and defense counsel, please, People's Exhibit 217 for identification?

Note: [Displayed.]

Susan Hoffinger: Do you recognize that document, Mr. Cohen?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Susan Hoffinger: What is it?

Michael Cohen: This is a communication between myself and Jay Sekulow.

Susan Hoffinger: And does the communication reflect the use of an encrypted app called Signal?

Michael Cohen: It is.

Susan Hoffinger: And are these screenshots of Signal communications with Mr. Sekulow?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And is this an exact screenshot or photo -- exact copies of communications you had with Mr. Sekulow at the time reflected in this record?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: At this time, I offer People's Exhibit 217 in evidence.

Todd Blanche: No objection.

Juan Merchan: 217 is accepted into evidence.

Note: [Document is so received in evidence.]

Susan Hoffinger: Can we put that on the screen for everyone and blow up the communication on February 19th of 2018?

Note: [Displayed.]

Susan Hoffinger: Can you read that communication? Who was that communication from?

Michael Cohen: This is from me to Jay Sekulow. I apologize, from Jay Sekulow to me.

Susan Hoffinger: Was this after you sent him the public statement that you were going to be making about the FEC Complaints?

Michael Cohen: Yes. Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Can you read in what Mr. Sekulow wrote to you?

Michael Cohen: He says: Client says thanks for what you do.

Susan Hoffinger: And what is your understanding about who he was referring to when he was referring to, client?

Michael Cohen: Client here is referred as President Donald Trump. And, for what you do, that dealt with the statement that I was putting out to the press on the FEC.

Susan Hoffinger: You're denying his involvement?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, also in February of '18, 2018, did you -- withdrawn. Around the same time in February of 2018, did The Wall Street Journal reach out to you about an article they were going to write concerning AMI's payoff of Karen McDougal?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: And, actually, specifically, did they reach out to you about a FEC Complaint about AMI's payoff of Karen McDougal?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And do you recall what The Wall Street Journal was asking you about in connection with that?

Michael Cohen: AMI's participation in the payoff.

Susan Hoffinger: And were they asking you also about anybody else's involvement in that payoff, other than AMI?

Michael Cohen: David Pecker.

Susan Hoffinger: Were they asking at all about your involvement or Mr. Trump's involvement?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you speak to Mr. Pecker around that time about the FEC Complaint that AMI had received?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Can you tell the jury about, generally, what was discussed between yourself and Mr. Pecker?

Michael Cohen: So, David was very concerned because it was going to affect AMI. It was going to affect him. And so, I had told him that I would assist with this matter. And I, ultimately, told him that after conversations with the President, do not worry. We have this thing under control. It', S going to be taken care of.

Todd Blanche: Your Honor, may I speak to counsel for one minute?

Juan Merchan: Sure.

Note: [Susan Hoffinger and Todd Blanche confer.]

Todd Blanche: May we briefly approach, your Honor?

Juan Merchan: Yes.

Note: [Discussion is held at sidebar, on the record.]

Todd Blanche: I am not trying to disrupt the flow. I would ask for a limiting instruction about what we just heard about the AMI conversations. I wouldn't ask you to restate the full instruction, just that the same instruction applies to the testimony regarding Mr. Pecker getting a Notice from the FEC.

Susan Hoffinger: I think we already addressed that.

Juan Merchan: I did give an instruction.

Todd Blanche: I am not asking for the full instruction, just a reminder.

Susan Hoffinger: I think you gave a full instruction when Mr. Pecker testified, but it' S up to the Court.

Juan Merchan: What would you like me to say?

Todd Blanche: Remind them, if you could, that you previously instructed them upon why the AMI evidence came in and that instruction still applies.

Juan Merchan: Okay.

Note: [Discussion at sidebar concluded, and the following occurred in open court.]

Juan Merchan: So, Jurors, you may recall that I previously gave you an instruction regarding AMI. The testimony that you just heard now is consistent with my previous instructions that that evidence was permitted to assist you, the jury, in assessing David Pecker's credibility and to help provide context for some other surrounding events.

Juan Merchan: You may consider that testimony and what you just heard for those purposes only. Mr. Blanche, is that satisfactory?

Todd Blanche: Thank you, your Honor.

Note: [Continued direct examination by Susan Hoffinger.]

Susan Hoffinger: Mr. Cohen, just getting back to where we left off in my questions. In terms of the substance of your conversation with David Pecker about his receipt of the Complaint from the FEC, did you tell him that someone in particular in the administration would be able to assist in that manner?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: What did you tell him?

Michael Cohen: I told him that the matter is going to be taken care of and the person, of course, who is going to be able to do it is Jeff Sessions.

Susan Hoffinger: Who was Jeff Sessions at the time?

Michael Cohen: The Attorney General.

Susan Hoffinger: Why did you tell him that?

Michael Cohen: Because that was post my conversation with the President.

Susan Hoffinger: And when you say, post, had you previously been told that by President Trump?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, I know you mentioned previously the work that you did on the Temporary Restraining Order related to Stormy Daniels. Do you remember that testimony?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Did there come a time when, as a result of some of the public statements you were making about your being the only one involved in the payment, and the fact that -- withdrawn. That is a long sentence -- a long question. Did there come a time around this time period that you made certain statements to news reporting, indicating that only you had made the payment and that, in fact, no sexual encounter had occurred?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you learn, as a result of that, that Ms. Daniels was going to go out publicly and speak about the matter to some news outlets like 60 Minutes and Fox News?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And, as a result of that, was that why, in part, you attempted, along with Larry Rosen, to get a Temporary Restraining Order for her?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And was that at Mr. Trump's direction to work with Larry Rosen to get a Temporary Restraining Order?

Michael Cohen: Yes. As well as with Eric Trump.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, did you, in fact -- did you, in fact, get an arbitration court Temporary Restraining Order?

Michael Cohen: We did. We filed the arbitration proceeding in California through an in-house attorney with the Trump Organization named Jill Martin, because Larry -- neither Larry Rosen or I are California Bar admitted, SO she filed the arbitration.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you provide that Temporary Restraining Order to Keith Davidson, Ms. Daniels' attorney?

Michael Cohen: I tried.

Susan Hoffinger: Explain that.

Michael Cohen: After obtaining the arbitration proceeding decision, we were granted a Temporary Restraining Order. You are required to serve it upon the individual, and I didn't, of course, have her address. So I tried to serve it upon Keith Davidson. And when I say, I, I am talking about the -- I'm talking about the group, Larry Rosen, Jill Martin, et cetera.

Michael Cohen: And at some point --

Susan Hoffinger: I am sorry.

Michael Cohen: -- we weren't able to do that. And then Keith Davidson responded to me that he is no longer representing her. And he gave me the name of another lawyer that he said was representing her. After speaking to that lawyer, he also stated that he wasn't representing her. And, again, still unable to get her address to serve it. Ultimately, it was provided to me that Michael Avenatti was going to be representing her going forward.

Susan Hoffinger: And at some point after that, did Mr. Avenatti file a lawsuit against Mr. Trump, yourself and Essential Consultants to try to get freed from the Non-Disclosure Agreement?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And, eventually, in September of 2018, did Mr. Trump and yourself agree not to enforce the NDA?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And do you recall when Mr. Trump agreed through his lawyers not to enforce the NDA? At what point in the proceedings did that occur?

Michael Cohen: I don't recall.

Susan Hoffinger: Was that a civil case?

Michael Cohen: It is, yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Was he going to be required to sit for a deposition in that case?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Can you explain that a little bit to the jury?

Michael Cohen: So, the action was filed, and what proceeded was, from the civil action, was Mr. Trump would be required -- President Trump would be required to sit for a deposition. And prior to that date where he would be required to sit, the decision was made that he would not sit and, therefore, the matter was agreed to and the Non-Disclosure Agreement was terminated.

Todd Blanche: Objection, your Honor. And I ask that that be stricken.

Juan Merchan: Please approach.

Note: [Discussion is held at sidebar, on the record.]

Todd Blanche: Your Honor, I don't know what foundation was laid that he had or didn't have to give that answer. I don't believe there was any foundation for him knowing the answer that he just gave about why the decision was made. I mean, this happened, I believe, in September of 2018.

Juan Merchan: So your objection is there is not a foundation?

Todd Blanche: Along with several --

Susan Necheles: Your Honor, if President Trump took the Fifth Amendment, and they are trying to give an inference that he would do that, that he didn't testify because he might have incriminated himself, that might -- I am sorry -- this is SO improper. That he would have taken the Fifth, he didn't want to testify. This is SO improper.

Susan Hoffinger: I didn't elicit that.

Susan Necheles: That was totally the inference. The inference is that --

Juan Merchan: You have two different objections?

Susan Necheles: I think both objections. That it all be stricken and that the jury be instructed that that should all be disregarded.

Susan Hoffinger: I can certainly lay more of a foundation.

Juan Merchan: I think you are going far afield.

Susan Hoffinger: Okay. I will stop at this point. Thank you.

Note: [Discussion at sidebar concluded, and the following occurred in open court.]

Juan Merchan: The objection is sustained. The answer is stricken from the record, and the jury is directed not to consider that response.

Susan Hoffinger: Thank you, your Honor.

Note: [Continued direct examination by Susan Hoffinger.]

Susan Hoffinger: Through much of 2018, while you were acting as Mr. Trump -- then President Trump's personal attorney, did you continue to lie about his role in the payoff to Stormy Daniels?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: I want to direct your attention now to April 9th of 2018. What happened to you on that day?

Michael Cohen: I was raided by the FBI.

Susan Hoffinger: Can you tell the jury a little bit about that?

Michael Cohen: So, at the time I was residing at the Lowes Regency because my apartment had been flooded by the apartment above. We had moved into the Regency while the construction was taking place in the apartment. At seven o'clock in the morning, there was a knock on the door. And I looked through the peephole, and I saw a ton of people out in the hallway.

Michael Cohen: And so, I saw a badge. So, I opened the door. They identified themselves as the FBI, asked me to step into the hallway, which I did. I found out that simultaneously they had also, the FBI, raided my apartment that was under construction, my law office and TD Bank, which had a safety deposit box that I had just opened in order to put valuables in because I didn't want to keep them in the hotel or, obviously, in the apartment.

Michael Cohen: It was under repair.

Susan Hoffinger: And did the FBI search those locations for items of yours?

Michael Cohen: They did.

Susan Hoffinger: And what kind of things did they seize from you when they executed that search warrant at your hotel room?

Michael Cohen: The search warrant gave them the right to take my two cell phones, to take any and all electronic devices, as well as records. They took my two cell phones and a series of my tax books, as well as other documents. I, ultimately, found out that they also, basically, packed up much of the documentation that was in my law office and took that as well.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, you mentioned two cell phones that they took. Were those the two cell phones associated with the numbers ending 0114 containing the phone, the audio recording with Donald Trump that we heard previously, which is People's Exhibit 246?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: So that was one of the phones that they seized, is that right?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And they seized another cell phone as well in addition, is that right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, the cell phone that they took containing the audio recording of yourself and Mr. Trump, did you know that the FBI was going to show up and take your phones?

Michael Cohen: No, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Had you, prior to them showing up and taking those phones from you, altered that recording of your conversation with Mr. Trump on September 6th of 2016?

Michael Cohen: No, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: HOW did you feel at the time about the FBI searching your hotel room, your home, your law offices? How were you feeling at the time?

Michael Cohen: How do you describe your life being turned upside down? Concerned. Despondent. Angry.

Susan Hoffinger: Were you frightened?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you come to understand, as a result of these search warrants that were executed, that you were under investigation by Federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you speak with President Trump shortly after these search warrants were executed?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: Can you explain the conversation? Can you describe the conversation you had with then President Trump?

Michael Cohen: I received a phone call from President Trump in response to me leaving a message for him to call me. I wanted, obviously, him to know what was taking place. And he said to me: Don't worry. I am the President of the United States. There is no -- there is nothing here. Everything is going to be okay. Stay tough.

Michael Cohen: You are going to be okay.

Susan Hoffinger: Have you spoken directly with Mr. Trump since that time?

Michael Cohen: No, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Was your call from President Trump at that time important to you?

Michael Cohen: Extremely important.

Susan Hoffinger: Why was it important?

Michael Cohen: Because I wanted -- first of all, I was scared. This was the first time in my life anything like this happened, and I wanted some reassurance that Mr. Trump had my back. Especially as -- especially his help with issues that related to him.

Susan Hoffinger: How, if at all, did that call affect you in terms of how you acted going forward?

Michael Cohen: Well, when he expressed to me, don't worry, everything is going to be fine, I am the President of the United States, I felt reassured because I had the President of the United States protecting me, his Justice Department. This should go nowhere. And so, I felt reassured, and I remained in the camp.

Susan Hoffinger: What do you mean by, in the camp?

Michael Cohen: In the fold. In the, um, in the Trump camp.

Susan Hoffinger: Does that mean that you stayed loyal to him?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And continued to lie about his involvement?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: And did other people reach out to you around this time and express President Trump's support for you?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: In general, what did others tell you?

Michael Cohen: You are loved. Don't worry. He's got your back. Most powerful guy in the country, if not the world. You are going to be okay.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, after the FBI executed those search warrants and you received that call from President Trump and messages from others, did you initially maintain ties with President Trump?

Michael Cohen: Only through other people.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you believe that was important to do?

Michael Cohen: Extremely.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we show People's Exhibit 407-F, please, in evidence? Can we blow up the top tweet?

Note: [Displayed.]

Susan Hoffinger: And I am going to ask Mr. Cohen to read them. First of all, were you aware of these three tweets made by President Trump at that time on April 21st of 2018.

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And can you read those, please, to the jury?

Michael Cohen: This is from Mr. Trump's Twitter feed. The New York Times and a third rate reporter named Maggie Haberman, known as a Crocked H flunkey, who I don't speak to and have nothing to do with, are going out of their way to destroy Michael Cohen and his relationship with me in the hope that he will flip. They use nonexistent sources and a drunk/drugged up loser who hates Michael, a fine person with a wonderful family.

Michael Cohen: Michael is a businessman for his own account slash lawyer who I have always liked and respected. Most people will flip if the Government let's them out of trouble. Even if it means lying or making up stories. Sorry, I don't know -- I don't see Michael doing that despite the horrible Witch Hunt and the dishonest media.

Susan Hoffinger: Who did you understand, at the time, that Mr. Trump was communicating with or releasing these public statements?

Michael Cohen: To me.

Susan Hoffinger: And what did you understand him to be communicating to you?

Michael Cohen: Stay in the fold. Stay loyal. I have you. You are a fine person. Don't flip.

Susan Hoffinger: And what did these public statements -- what, if anything, did these public statements have on you in terms of an effect on your conduct at the time?

Michael Cohen: It reinforced my loyalty and my intention to stay in the fold.

Susan Hoffinger: Was President Trump or his company, The Trump Organization, still paying your lawyer's legal fees at the time?

Michael Cohen: They were.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you understand that that was part of his support for you?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And during this time were you still a part of the Joint Defense Agreement with President Trump and some others?

Michael Cohen: I was.

Susan Hoffinger: We can take that down. Thank you. I have one further question. Can you put that up?

Susan Hoffinger: Most people will flip if the Government let's them get out of trouble.

Susan Hoffinger: If you can put that up one more time.

Note: [Displayed.]

Susan Hoffinger: Based on that line, most people will flip if the Government let's them out of trouble, based on that public communication, what did you understand Mr. Trump wanted in terms of whether you should cooperate with law enforcement?

Todd Blanche: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you have any understanding at the time from that public statement about whether you should cooperate with law enforcement?

Todd Blanche: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained as to the form. Please rephrase.

Susan Hoffinger: What, if any, understanding did you have about that public statement?

Michael Cohen: That Mr. Trump did not want me to cooperate with Government and certainly not to provide information or flip.

Susan Hoffinger: And if you had cooperated with law enforcement at that time and told them the truth, what would you have told them about Mr. Trump's involvement in the Stormy Daniels payoff?

Todd Blanche: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Susan Hoffinger: Your Honor, would you like to take a -- let me know if this is a good time for a break.

Note: [Continued direct examination by Susan Hoffinger]

Susan Hoffinger: Mr. Cohen, are you familiar with an attorney by the name of Robert Costello?

Michael Cohen: I am.

Susan Hoffinger: How do you know him?

Michael Cohen: I was introduced to Robert Costello by another lawyer named Jeff Citron.

Susan Hoffinger: And how did Mr. Citron first put you in touch with Mr. Costello?

Michael Cohen: Mr. Citron and I were both on the Advisory Board for Sterling National Bank. And after the raid, he obviously heard about it and saw it, he connected myself and Robert Costello together for the possibility of representing me in this matter.

Susan Hoffinger: Did Mr. Citron tell you anything about Mr. Costello's background?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: What did he tell you, in substance?

Michael Cohen: He told me he was a criminal defense attorney and that he was incredibly close to Rudy Giuliani.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, did there come a time in April of 2018, after the search warrants, that you met with Mr. Costello?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Where did you meet with him?

Michael Cohen: I met with him in the conference room at the Regency Hotel where I was staying.

Susan Hoffinger: And, in general, what was your emotional state like at the time you met with him?

Michael Cohen: Distraught, nervous, concerned.

Susan Hoffinger: And can you tell the jury about your conversation at the Regency Hotel with Mr. Costello?

Michael Cohen: So, it was Mr. Citron, myself and Robert Costello. They asked me to show them copies of the warrants, to describe what had happened. Which I did, at length. Basically, it was many hours, that many agents came, they took a series of books, documents, and I gave them the receipt of what was taken. With that, they turned around and they said, there are certain things you need to know.

Michael Cohen: First is, that you have to, obviously, try to remember what might be in any of those boxes, what they might be looking for. He walked me through the process. First time in my life. I never practiced criminal law. And then they asked me to consider Robert Costello for my representation.

Susan Hoffinger: Did Mr. Costello at that meeting tell you anything about his ties to Mr. Giuliani?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: In substance, what did he tell you?

Michael Cohen: He said he had been at the Southern District of New York. That he is incredibly close to Rudy Giuliani. And what I mean by close, he means as close as you can imagine. And that would be a relationship that would be very beneficial to you going forward with this matter.

Susan Hoffinger: Can you explain why that would be a beneficial relationship for you?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: What did he say?

Michael Cohen: Because Mr. Giuliani at the time had a very close relationship and was spending a tremendous amount of time with President Trump.

Susan Hoffinger: And did he speak to you about a back channel of communications?

Michael Cohen: He also stated to me that this would be a great way to have a back channel communication to the President in order to ensure that you' re still good and that you're still secure.

Susan Hoffinger: During that meeting, did you tell Mr. Costello the truth about what Mr. Trump's role was in the payoff to Stormy Daniels?

Michael Cohen: No.

Susan Hoffinger: Why not?

Michael Cohen: First, I wasn't sure that I was going to hire him. There was something really sketchy and wrong about him. He came with a Retainer Agreement, and I said, "I'm not going to pay that right now. I am still speaking to other lawyers." So I certainly wasn't going to expose anything to, one, someone I didn't know, and two, I was having trouble connecting with.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you understand that if you provided that information to him about Mr. Trump's involvement in the Stormy Daniels matter, that that information might go somewhere else?

Michael Cohen: I was also concerned, again, when he started talking about his incredibly close relationship to Rudy, that anything I said to him was going to be spoken and told to Rudy Giuliani. And, of course, because Rudy Giuliani at the time was SO proximate to Mr. Trump, President Trump, that anything that I said would get back to him.

Susan Hoffinger: Did Mr. Costello mention anything to you about whether -- withdrawn. After the meeting with Mr. Costello, did you also have some phone calls with him?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you also exchange some emails or text messages with him?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: In some phone calls, did he ever mention to you that it would not be a good idea for you to speak with President Trump directly?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And did he suggest some other method of communication?

Michael Cohen: Again, back channel from Robert Costello to Rudy.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, you mentioned that you exchanged emails with Mr. Costello?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And on the thumb drive that you previously reviewed, did you also have an opportunity to review emails with Mr. Costello marked as People's Exhibit 203 to 205 for identification?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you exchange those emails from your email account to Mr. Costello's email account?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And other than some redactions, are those emails exact copies of email communications you exchanged with Mr. Costello on the dates and times reflected in those emails?

Michael Cohen: They are.

Susan Hoffinger: Your Honor, I offer People's Exhibit 203 through -- I apologize, 208 in evidence.

Todd Blanche: No objection.

Juan Merchan: People's 203 through 208 are accepted into evidence.

Note: [Whereupon, People's Exhibits 203 through 208 were received and marked into evidence.]

Susan Hoffinger: Now, can we please put up People's Exhibit 203.

Note: [Displayed.]

Susan Hoffinger: Can you tell the jury what this is, and walk us through it?

Michael Cohen: This is an email that I received from Robert Costello on Thursday, April 19, 2018, at 6:45 p.m. It is cc'd to Jeffrey Citron as a followup: "I am sure you saw the news that Rudy is joining the Trump legal team. I told you my relationship with Rudy, which can be very, very useful for you. Bob Costello."

Susan Hoffinger: What did you understand this email to be about?

Michael Cohen: To validate the relationship with Rudy that he expressed to me. And, again, to re-enforce the whole concept of the back channel.

Susan Hoffinger: Please put up People 204 in evidence.

Note: [Displayed.]

Susan Hoffinger: Can you read that email and also explain it to the jury?

Michael Cohen: It is from Robert Costello. Again, to me. Dated Saturday, April 21, 2018, at 12:02 a.m. Subject is: Giuliani. He writes: Privileged and confidential. "Michael, I just spoke to Rudy Giuliani and told him I was on your team. Rudy was thrilled and said this could not be a better situation for the President or you.

Michael Cohen: He asked me if it was okay to call the President and Jay Sekulow. And I said, fine." "We discussed the facts, Jay Goldberg's stupid remarks, et cetera." He said: "I can't tell you how pleased I am that I could work with someone I know and trust. He asked me to tell you that he knows how tough this is on you and your family and he will make sure -- to make sure to tell the President." He said: "Thank you for opening this back channel of communication and asked me to keep in touch." "I told him I would after speaking to you further" "Bob."

Susan Hoffinger: And, again, who is Jay Sekulow referenced in here as well?

Michael Cohen: Attorney for the President.

Susan Hoffinger: Who did you understand, based on this email and your communications with Mr. Costello, that that back channel communication would be with?

Michael Cohen: The back channel was Bob Costello to Rudy to President Trump.

Susan Hoffinger: Please put up People's Exhibit 205.

Note: [Displayed.]

Susan Hoffinger: Mr. Cohen, if you would explain who those emails are to and from and read the email to the jury?

Michael Cohen: It's from Robert Costello. It was sent on Saturday, April 21, 2018, at 8:57 p.m. to me. Subject: Again, Giuliani. It is stating: Attorney-client communication, privileged. "I spoke with Rudy. Very, very positive. You are loved. If you want to call me, I will give you the details. I told him everything you asked me to and he said they knew that.

Michael Cohen: There was never a doubt, and they are in our corner. Rudy said this communication channel must be maintained. He called it crucial and noted how reassured they were that they had someone like me who Rudy has known for SO many years in this role. Sleep well tonight. You have friends in high places." ""P.S.: Some very positive comments about you from the White House.

Michael Cohen: Rudy noted how that followed my chat with him last night."

Susan Hoffinger: What did you understand Mr. Costello to mean by "you are loved," "by whom?

Michael Cohen: By President Trump.

Susan Hoffinger: What did you understand him to be referring to when he said "they are in our corner?"

Michael Cohen: Meaning the President and Rudy.

Susan Hoffinger: And what did you understand him to be referring to as "friends in high places?"

Michael Cohen: Friends in high places was President Trump.

Susan Hoffinger: And the P. S., where he says, "Some very positive comments about you from the White House -- "

Susan Hoffinger: Can we put up People, 's 407F that we just saw a little while ago.

Note: [Displayed.]

Susan Hoffinger: What is the date, what is the date of these public Truth -- tweets that we saw President Trump issuing about you?

Michael Cohen: April 21, 2018.

Susan Hoffinger: Is that the same date as the email that Mr. Costello sent you?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you understand Mr. Costello in his email to be responding to these public tweets that President Trump made about you?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: What, if any, effect did these emails from Mr. Costello, together with President Trump's support tweets for you on April 21st, what, if any, effect did they have on you?

Michael Cohen: It let me know that I was still important to the team and stay the course, that the President had my back.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we take a look now at People's Exhibit 206 in evidence.

Note: [Displayed.]

Susan Hoffinger: Is this email some months later, now in June of 2018?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Can you read this email for the jury, please, and the to and from and the dates?

Michael Cohen: It's from Robert Costello. Dated June 7, 2018, at 3:16 p.m. to me. Marked: Attorney-Client Privilege Communication. "Michael, to prove to you that Rudy Giuliani called me and I did not call him, I photographed the pages from my iPhone, which I am attaching. They show that you called me at 11:30 a.m. today on my cell and that the next call I had was two incoming calls from Rudy Giuliani at 1:08 p.m., and then at 1:15 p.m., because the first cell call transmission was lost.

Michael Cohen: Calling from Israel." "And Guilani called me back at 1:15." "After you called me back at 2:43 p.m. and we spoke, I called and left a message for Rudy at 2:55 New York time. I will let you know when I hear back from him."

Susan Hoffinger: What do you understand Mr. Costello communicating here and what was going on at the time?

Michael Cohen: He is demonstrating his close proximate relationship to Rudy Giuliani. Again, at this point in time I had not retained Costello or advised him that I was going to be retaining him. In order to stay in the fold, he was expressing to me his obvious relationship to Rudy Giuliani who was proximate to President Trump.

Susan Hoffinger: If you can take that down. Please put up People's 207 in evidence. Thank you. Can we blow that up, the first paragraph. Is there a way to blow up first the first paragraph? Can we see the date at the top of the email. Can we blow up the top of the e-mail for Mr. Cohen.

Note: [Displayed.]

Susan Hoffinger: Can you explain who it is from and who it is to and the date?

Michael Cohen: Again, from Robert Costello. It's dated June 13 of 2018 at 3:21 p.m. Subject: Forward update draft. Again, it's sent to me.

Susan Hoffinger: Can you read that first paragraph?

Michael Cohen: "Michael, since you jumped off the phone rather abruptly, I did not get a chance to tell you that my friend has communicated to me that he is meeting with his client this evening." And he added, "if there was anything you wanted to convey, you should tell me and my friend will bring it up for discussion this evening."

Susan Hoffinger: Who did you understand his reference to be "my friend," in other words, who was "my friend" that he is meeting with, his client this evening? Who did you understand that to be a reference to?

Michael Cohen: Rudy Giuliani.

Susan Hoffinger: Who would Mr. Gulani's client be?

Michael Cohen: Donald J. Trump, President Trump.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you have some understanding about why he didn't just say outright Rudy Giuliani and President Trump?

Michael Cohen: Sort of to be covert. It's all back channel sort of spy-ish. Didn't want to put anybody's name. Why on this one as opposed to this one? But, clearly, never mentioning President Trump, using code words.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we blow up the second paragraph in the email.

Note: [Displayed.]

Susan Hoffinger: Read that, Mr. Cohen?

Michael Cohen: "I would suggest that you give this invitation some real thought. Today's newspaper story should not rattle you. The event announced today we thought would be announced Friday or Monday, SO it's merely a difference of timing." "MWE, McDermott Will & Emery, were brought in to a discrete task. They performed those services in an exemplary fashion.

Michael Cohen: This is not a change in plan. Rather, it is exactly what was planned.' "Your message, or the message of MWE, should be positive and not negative in any way. What you do next is for you to decide. But if that choice requires any discussion with my friend's client, you have the opportunity to convey that this evening, but only if you SO decide."

Susan Hoffinger: Again, what did you understand him to be saying, "If you want to convey something to my friend's client?"

Michael Cohen: Talking about potential pre-pardons, I believe.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we blow up the third paragraph.

Susan Hoffinger: Who is my friend's client in that paragraph?

Michael Cohen: President Trump.

Susan Hoffinger: Read the third paragraph.

Michael Cohen: "I must tell you, quite frankly, that I'm not used to listening to abuse like today's conversation. You have called me numerous times over the last month to discuss issues. I have already tried to be as helpful as I could." "You told me back in April that I was part of the team. I've acted accordingly on your behalf." "When I suggested that we meet and discuss a strategy following this news, you suddenly took a new approach and stated, "That's not going to happen." "Stunned by this remark, I was asking you for a clarification of our legal relationship.

Michael Cohen: You indicated that you would be talking to someone in a boutique firm that was not ready to get involved. When I noted that you were willing to sit down with them but not sit down with us, you had an unfortunate outburst." "I relayed the situation to Jeff Citron, who suggested that you probably were just having a bad moment, but that it was necessary to seek clarification of our position with you in light of your remarks. "

Susan Hoffinger: What was happening at the time? What did you understand this to be about?

Michael Cohen: So, Mr. Costello, again, pressuring me, as he had done, with constant calls and sending me emails and SO on. And he wanted to absolutely be retained to represent me in this matter. I stated to him that I was speaking with someone in a boutique firm and that we were still not yet ready for the engagement.

Michael Cohen: He was angered that I was willing to sit down with that other attorney, but not sit down with them. And SO I had had enough and I told him. Then it goes on to mention Jeff Citron. That is the lawyer who I had the relationship with on the Advisory Board of Sterling Bank for a couple of years. And, then, of course, expressed in the last line that it was necessary to seek clarification of the position in light of me telling them that's just not going to happen.

Michael Cohen: My concern here was that all of these conversations were being relayed back to Mr. Giuliani and, of course, his client, President Trump.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we pull up the last paragraph in the email.

Note: [Displayed.]

Susan Hoffinger: Can you read that, Mr. Cohen?

Michael Cohen: "Please remember if you want or need to communicate something, please let me know and I will see that it gets done. I hope I am wrong, but it seems to both Jeff and I, perhaps we have been played here. Let me know what you want to do. "

Susan Hoffinger: What did you understand him to be mean "that it seemed like he was being played here?"

Michael Cohen: I was not going to retain them. That they had, of course, expressed -- Jeff -- I should say, Bob Costello had expressed clearly to Mr. Giuliani that he was on the team and that he was going to be representing me. The concern here was that I was going to go to another lawyer and retain another lawyer to represent me in this matter.

Susan Hoffinger: What did you understand him to mean by "If you need to communicate something, he would get it done," who did you understand he was talking about communicating with?

Michael Cohen: To Rudy Giuliani. Ultimately, to reach President Trump.

Susan Hoffinger: Thank you. You can take that down. Please put up People's Exhibit 208. Blow up the top of the email.

Note: [Displayed.]

Michael Cohen: This is from Bob Costello to me on Thursday, June 14, 2018, at 9:45 a .m. Hyperlink to a YouTube video. And he writes: "Something you should see. Bob. "

Susan Hoffinger: And do you have a recollection of what that video that he was sending you, what it was about, or did he disclose it in a further part of this email?

Michael Cohen: I don't.

Susan Hoffinger: Let's take a look at the next email in the chain.

Note: [Displayed.]

Susan Hoffinger: What does the subject line of your response email to him say?

Michael Cohen: "Giuliani on Possibility of Cohen Cooperating: Mueller Probe. "

Susan Hoffinger: Does that refresh your recollection about what the YouTube video was about?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: What was it about, in general?

Michael Cohen: It was Rudy Giuliani in a TV appearance talking about my potential cooperation with the Mueller probe.

Susan Hoffinger: And what did you respond to him?

Michael Cohen: Why send this to me?

Susan Hoffinger: Can we look at the next email in the chain, where there is an answer from Mr. Costello. If you could blow up the first paragraph.

Note: [Displayed.]

Michael Cohen: This is an email, again, from Robert Costello to me. The same date, June 14, 2018, at 1:12 p.m. "The answer to your question will be found in watching the video. It seems clear to me that you are under the impression that Trump and Giuliani are trying to discredit you and throw you under the bus, to use your phrase." "I think you are wrong, because you are believing the narrative promoted by the left wing media.

Michael Cohen: They want you to believe what they are writing. Many of them are already writing that you are cooperating. This strategy has been consistent from the start, to put pressure on you into believing that you are alone. That everyone you knew before is distancing themselves from you and you are being 'thrown under the bus' ." "The whole objective of this exercise by the SDNY is to drain you emotionally and financially until you reach a point that you see them as your only means to salvation.

Michael Cohen: I told you that the very first day I met you. "

Susan Hoffinger: Blow up the last paragraph as well in this email.

Note: [Displayed.]

Michael Cohen: "You are making a very big mistake if you believe the stories these journalists are writing about you. They want you to cave. They want you to fail. They do not want you to persevere and succeed." "If you really believe you are not being supported properly by your former boss, then you should make your position known." "If you really want certain things to happen, you should make that known." ""If you really want other lawyers to refrain from saying this or that, you should make it known." "You have the ability to make that communication when you want to. Whether you exercise that ability is totally up to you. "

Susan Hoffinger: What did you understand Mr. Costello to be communicating to you here?

Michael Cohen: And this is part of the pressure campaign, that everyone is lying to you. That you are still regarded. The President still supports you. Do not speak. Do not listen to what any of the journalists or anybody are saying and stay in the fold. Don't flip. Don't speak. Don't cooperate.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you understand that he was -- what did you understand he was telling you about whether you should cooperate with law enforcement?

Michael Cohen: Not to.

Susan Hoffinger: What did you understand him to be saying to you in terms of, if you really want things to happen, if you want to make things known, you should let me know, what did you understand that to be about?

Michael Cohen: Again, him being a back channel.

Susan Hoffinger: Back channel to who?

Michael Cohen: Back channel to the President via Rudy Giuliani.

Susan Hoffinger: Mr. Cohen, did you ever tell the truth, Mr. Cohen, about President Trump -- withdrawn. Mr. Cohen, did you ever tell the truth to Mr. Costello about Donald Trump's involvement in AMI's purchase of Karen McDougal's story to prevent that coming out before the election or Donald Trump's involvement and direction to your paying Stormy Daniels to prevent her story from coming out before the election?

Michael Cohen: No.

Susan Hoffinger: Why did you not tell Mr. Costello the truth about Mr. Trump's involvement in those matters?

Michael Cohen: I didn' t trust him. Meaning, Bob Costello. And I was still remaining loyal to Mr. Trump.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you believe that if you told him the truth, that he would tell that to someone?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Who did you believe he would tell it to?

Michael Cohen: I believed, based upon all of our conversations, that he would immediately run back to Mr. Giuliani and that communication would be divulged to President Trump.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you ever retain Mr. Costello to represent you?

Michael Cohen: No.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you instead retain other lawyers to represent you in connection with the criminal investigation by the Southern District of New York?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, in the months after those FBI raids on your home, your office, your hotel room, in addition to seeking advice from lawyers about what to do, did you have some conversations with your family about the matter?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And tell the jury a bit about those conversations with your family?

Michael Cohen: Well, at that point in time we didn't even know what the Southern District of New York was even looking at. And the conversations with my family was what to do. We're in this unique situation I never experienced. And my family, my wife, my daughter, my son, all said to me, why are you holding onto this loyalty?

Michael Cohen: What are you doing? We're supposed to be your first loyalty?

Susan Hoffinger: So what decision did you make?

Michael Cohen: That it was about time to listen to them.

Susan Hoffinger: What did you decide about where your loyalty should be going forward?

Michael Cohen: To my wife, my daughter, my son, and the country.

Susan Hoffinger: Let me direct your attention now to August 21, 2018. Did you plead guilty on that day in a court in the Southern District of New York to a number of federal crimes?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: By that time, in late August of 2018, what, if anything, had you decided about whether you would continue to lie for President Trump?

Michael Cohen: I made a decision based on the conversation that I had with my family, I would not lie for President Trump any longer.

Susan Hoffinger: And on August 21, 2018, did you plead guilty to one count of making an excessive campaign contribution in violation of the Federal Election Campaign Act?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: What did that charge relate to?

Michael Cohen: Stormy Daniels.

Susan Hoffinger: And did it relate to, specifically, your paying $130,000 to Stormy Daniels to buy the life rights to her story SO that it would not be public and that it was done on behalf of President Trump to influence the election?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you admit that you paid that money to Stormy Daniels in order to influence Mr. Trump's electoral prospects?

Todd Blanche: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Approach.

Note: [Whereupon, proceedings were held at sidebar.]

Juan Merchan: Please read back the last two questions.

Note: [Whereupon, the Official Court Reporter read back the referred-to-questions.]

Todd Blanche: We object to leading the witness. If the question is: Did you plead guilty? Yes. What did you plead guilty to? That's fair. But just leading him through the allegations --

Juan Merchan: That's fair. I apologize. That's fair. I was sustaining the objection. And also let me know if you want a limiting instruction to the jury.

Susan Hoffinger: And there's a few more questions about the plea.

Todd Blanche: And I do. Thank you, Judge.

Note: [Whereupon, the following proceedings were held in open court.]

Juan Merchan: The objection is sustained.

Susan Hoffinger: Thank you.

Note: [Continued direct examination by Susan Hoffinger]

Susan Hoffinger: In fact, Mr. Cohen, did you pay the money to Stormy Daniels in order to influence the election for Mr. Trump?

Todd Blanche: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Susan Hoffinger: Why, in fact, did you pay that money to Stormy Daniels?

Michael Cohen: To ensure that the story would not come out, would not effect Mr. Trump's chances of becoming President of the United States.

Susan Hoffinger: If not for the campaign, Mr. Cohen, would you have paid that money to Stormy Daniels?

Michael Cohen: No, ma'am.

Todd Blanche: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Overruled. You can answer.

Michael Cohen: No, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: At whose direction and on whose behalf did you commit that crime?

Michael Cohen: On behalf of Mr. Trump.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, was one of the other charges that you pled guilty to in the Southern District of New York Causing an Unlawful Corporate Contribution in Violation of the Federal Election Campaign Act?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: What did that relate to?

Michael Cohen: That related to my participation with AMI in the Karen McDougal matter.

Susan Hoffinger: And what was the purpose of your working with AMI to pay off Karen McDougal?

Michael Cohen: In order to ensure that Mr. Trump was protected and that that story would never be released.

Susan Hoffinger: For what purpose?

Michael Cohen: For the purpose of ensuring that it also didn't effect the Presidential Campaign.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you work with AMI to do that, in order to influence the 2016 Presidential Campaign?

Todd Blanche: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Susan Hoffinger: Why did you work with AMI to pay off Karen McDougal?

Michael Cohen: In order to ensure the possibility of Mr. Trump succeeding in the election, that this would not be a hindrance.

Susan Hoffinger: Not be a hindrance, did you say?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Susan Hoffinger: On whose direction, on whose behalf did you work with AMI to do that?

Michael Cohen: I worked with Dylan Howard. I worked with David Pecker. And also Dan Rotstein.

Susan Hoffinger: At whose direction and on whose behalf did you do that?

Michael Cohen: At the direction of Donald J. Trump.

Susan Hoffinger: And for whose benefit?

Michael Cohen: For the benefit of Donald J. Trump.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, did you also plead guilty to five counts of --

Todd Blanche: We would ask for the instruction, please.

Juan Merchan: All right. Jurors, I'm going to give you an instruction at this time. You have just heard testimony that Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to violating the Federal Elections Campaign Act, otherwise known as FECA. That evidence was permitted to assist you, the jury, in assessing Mr. Cohen's credibility as a witness and to help provide context for some of the events that followed.

Juan Merchan: You may consider that testimony for those purposes only. Mr. Cohen's plea is not evidence of the defendant's guilt, and you may not consider it in determining whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty of the charged crimes.

Susan Hoffinger: Thank you, your Honor.

Susan Hoffinger: Mr. Cohen, did you also plead guilty to five counts of Evasion of Personal Income Tax for the years 2012 to 2016?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you also plead guilty to one count of Making False Statements to a Financial Institution?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: Were those counts: Tax Evasion and False Statements to a Financial Institution, were those in any way related to Mr. Trump?

Michael Cohen: No.

Susan Hoffinger: Mr. Cohen, what was that day like for you, pleading guilty to all those crimes?

Michael Cohen: Worst day of my life.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we please put up People's Exhibit 407H and 407I. If we can do them together.

Note: [Displayed.]

Susan Hoffinger: Mr. Trump -- I am sorry, Mr. Cohen, are you able to read those?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: What date -- you plead guilty on August 21, 2018?

Michael Cohen: That is correct.

Susan Hoffinger: What are the dates of these tweets by President Trump?

Michael Cohen: August 22 of 2018.

Susan Hoffinger: Were these the day after you pled guilty in Federal Court?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Can you please read one and then the other. First of all, were you aware of President Trump tweeting these on that day?

Michael Cohen: Yes. On his post he writes: "If anyone is looking for a good lawyer, I would strongly suggest that you don't retain the services of Michael Cohen." "Then put out another one: "I feel very badly for Paul Manafort and his wonderful family. Justice took a 12-year old tax case, among other things, applied tremendous pressure on him, and unlike Michael Cohen, he refused to break, make up stories in order to get a deal.

Michael Cohen: Such respect for a brave man "

Susan Hoffinger: Who did you understand these tweets by Trump to be addressed to?

Michael Cohen: To me.

Susan Hoffinger: What, if any, message did you understand he was communicating to you?

Michael Cohen: Certainly displeasure that I no longer, I guess, was important to the fold.

Susan Hoffinger: What, if anything, did you understand was being communicated to you about whether you should cooperate with law enforcement?

Michael Cohen: No, do not cooperate.

Susan Hoffinger: What, if any, effect did it have on you at the time to have the President of the United States tweeting this about you the day after you pled guilty?

Michael Cohen: It caused a lot of angst, anxiety.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, you can take those down.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, in spite of President Trump's public tweets about you, about three months later, on November 29, 2018, did you also plead guilty to one count of Making False Statements to Congress in 2017?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: And was that for making false statements to Congress in 2017, in connection with the Russia probe that you described previously to the jury?

Michael Cohen: Yes. A number of times and the duration, which I had stated and submitted as part of the record that I had spoken to Mr. Trump about the Trump Tower Moscow Project.

Susan Hoffinger: And were those false statements that you made to Congress in 2017 while were you Mr. Trump's personal counsel?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: President Trump's personal counsel?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, let me direct your attention to December 12, 2018. As a result of pleading guilty to the federal crimes that you've just described, your pleading guilty in August of 2018 and also November of 2018, were you sentenced by a Court in the Southern District of New York?

Michael Cohen: I was.

Susan Hoffinger: And what was the sentence that you received from the court as a result of pleading guilty to those crimes?

Michael Cohen: 36 months incarceration followed by 36 months of supervised release.

Susan Hoffinger: And were you also required to pay fines and some restitution?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Explain that to the jury, please?

Michael Cohen: So the restitution stemmed from the amount of tax that was not paid over the years from 2012 through 2016. And that tax bill amount was $1,394,000.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you pay those taxes back to the IRS?

Michael Cohen: I did, before even sentencing, when I finally found out from the Southern District of New York what the actual amount was.

Susan Hoffinger: After, were you also assessed some fines by the Court?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you, after being sentenced, did you also pay those fines?

Michael Cohen: I did. There were two fines. Each one for $50,000. One that dealt with Stormy Daniels and the other one that was for the campaign finance violation, I believe.

Susan Hoffinger: Were you certain -- was one of them for the false statements to Congress?

Michael Cohen: Yes, that's the false statement to Congress.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, approximately, when did you surrender to prison as a result of your sentence?

Michael Cohen: May 6th.

Susan Hoffinger: Of what year?

Michael Cohen: Of 2019.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, about three months after you surrendered to prison, in February of 2019, did you testify publicly before Congress?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: And how did that come about?

Michael Cohen: That came about by Representative Elijah Cummings, who was the Chair of the House Oversight Committee, reaching out to Lanny Davis, who is an attorney and was assisting me in legal strategy, as the case that I am talking about, the criminal case, was going on. They reached out to him and asked for me to appear.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you provide information to both the House and Senate Intelligence Committee and also the House Oversight Committee?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you agree and actually testify publicly before surrendering to prison?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: Was your testimony before Congress televised?

Michael Cohen: One of them was, yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And widely reported in the news as well?

Michael Cohen: It was.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you testify about a number of issues and matters relating to President Trump and some others?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you, among other things, testify about President Trump having directed you to pay off Stormy Daniels as prior to the election?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you also testify about President Trump reimbursing you for those payoffs?

Todd Blanche: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained

Susan Hoffinger: What, if anything, else did you testify about concerning reimbursement?

Michael Cohen: That Mr. Trump had directed me, and it was for his benefit.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you testify at all about the reimbursement of the monies to Stormy Daniels?

Todd Blanche: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Susan Hoffinger: What, if anything, else, did you testify about concerning the matter?

Michael Cohen: I testified about the reimbursement of the $130,000 with the payments made to me on the monthly basis.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you apologize to Congress during that testimony?

Michael Cohen: I apologized to Congress. I apologized to the country. I apologize to my family.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you apologize to Congress for also lying to them in 2017?

Todd Blanche: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Susan Hoffinger: What, if anything, did you apologize to Congress about, specifically?

Michael Cohen: For lying to them in the 2017 hearing that I was subpoenaed to attend.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you also apologize to the American public?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: What did you apologize to the American public for?

Michael Cohen: For lying to them, for acting in a way that suppressed information that the citizenry had a right to know in order to make the determination of the individual who was seeking the highest office in the land.

Susan Hoffinger: What was that experience like for you, to testify SO publicly before Congress?

Michael Cohen: Horrible.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, before you surrendered to prison in May of 2019 to serve out your sentence, did you also meet with and provide information to Prosecutors, for example, from the Special Counsel's office?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Is that the office that was investigating the Mueller investigation?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you meet with them on a number of times?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And provide information to them?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: To be clear, on your very first meeting with them in August of 2018, did you tell them the truth about your testimony before Congress in 2017?

Michael Cohen: I did not.

Susan Hoffinger: Why not?

Michael Cohen: Because I was still holding onto the loyalty to President Trump.

Susan Hoffinger: And after pleading guilty in August of 2018, August 21 of 2018, did you meet with the Special Counsel's Office on a number of other occasions?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: At that point, did you admit that your prior statements to Congress were false?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you provide them with other truthful testimony?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: A few months after testifying publicly to Congress in May of 2019, did you start your sentence, prison sentence?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: Where did you serve?

Michael Cohen: The Federal Correctional Institution in Otisville.

Susan Hoffinger: How long did you spend in prison?

Michael Cohen: Thirteen months.

Susan Hoffinger: You said your sentence was originally 36 months?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Susan Hoffinger: Why did you serve only 13 months?

Michael Cohen: As a result of COVID, under the CARES Act, based upon my comorbidities, I was permitted to leave and serve the remainder of the sentence in home confinement.

Susan Hoffinger: And were others similarly released during COVID from prison to serve out the rest of their time in home confinement?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Note: (Whereupon, Theresa Magniccari, Senior Court Reporter was

Susan Hoffinger: At some point while you were on home confinement or before -- withdrawn. At some point when you were released from prison and you were back in New York City, did you -- did you become -- at some point, were you sent back to prison?

Michael Cohen: I was. & Can you describe, just very briefly for the jury, what happened?

Todd Blanche: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Overruled.

Michael Cohen: I was on furlough, which is the way that the institution had returned me home, and awaiting a date to meet with a company called GEO, which does residential reentry. They do the monitoring under what's called the Federal Location Monitoring Agreement. It's an ankle bracelet. And I was finally given a date and was supposed to, the following day, head up to the Bronx to sign the paperwork and to do, um, the installation of the ankle bracelet.

Michael Cohen: Instead, I received a phone call from an individual by the name of Adam Pakula over at 500 Pearl Street, which is the area of the Southern District of New York. They have their Bureau of Prisons, as well, Department of Correction. And I'm told that I need to go there instead of up to the Bronx. And it just didn't make any sense.

Michael Cohen: So I asked a friend of mine who happens to be a lawyer, Jeffrey K. Levine, to come with me because something just seems wrong. We get there, and we're brought into an office with Adam Pakula, with his supervisor Ms. Enid Febus, and they give us a two-page document that's supposed to represent the Federal Location Monitoring Agreement.

Michael Cohen: It doesn't look like a Federal document to me or to my friend, Jeff. There's no identifiable numbers on it, some typos and spelling mistakes. And we're reading the first paragraph, and the first paragraph is a very broad paragraph of First Amendment violations: I'm not allowed to speak to the press --

Todd Blanche: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Susan Hoffinger: Just, Mr. Cohen, I'll

Susan Hoffinger: I'll just ask a few leading questions if I might, your Honor?

Juan Merchan: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Mr. Cohen, did the Agreement prevent you from speaking publicly and writing publicly?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you agree to sign that Agreement at that time?

Michael Cohen: I asked them if we could tamp down the language, as I had been working on a book --

Todd Blanche: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Susan Hoffinger: Mr. Cohen, I'm going to ask you a few direct questions.

Michael Cohen: Sure.

Susan Hoffinger: Just to shorten it up for the jury.

Michael Cohen: Sure.

Susan Hoffinger: When you were presented that Agreement, did you question it?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: As a result of questioning it, were you sent back to prison?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: When you went to prison, where were you sent to?

Michael Cohen: Back to solitary confinement.

Susan Hoffinger: And at some point, did you have a lawyer who petitioned a Court in the Southern District of New York to have you released from solitary confinement and from prison, back to home confinement?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And did the Judge in the Southern District rule --

Susan Hoffinger: I see that Mr. Blanche is standing.

Todd Blanche: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Susan Hoffinger: As a result, were you sent back, was a decision made that you were sent back to your apartment to continue the rest of your sentence in home confinement?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, at various times, you mentioned that you provided information to the Special Counsel's Office?

Michael Cohen: [Nods yes.] .

Susan Hoffinger: Did you also provide information to other law enforcement officers at their request?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: For example, did you provide information to the New York Attorney General's Office?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you also provide information to our Office, the New York County District Attorney's Office?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: At our request, on a number of occasions?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: In fact, the first time that you met with the District Attorney's Office of New York, was that when you were still incarcerated in prison?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And you did that at our request?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you continue on a number of occasions to meet with our Office to provide information and to answer questions?

Michael Cohen: Yes. On a total of three occasions.

Susan Hoffinger: On many occasions after that, did you also continue to provide information to our Office, on many occasions?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, in March of 2023, in connection with this case, did you testify in the grand jury?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: And when you testified in the grand jury pursuant to that subpoena, did you automatically receive immunity?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: And is it your understanding that that automatic immunity is provided to every witness who testifies in a grand jury in New York?

Michael Cohen: That's what my lawyer, Donny Perry, told me.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, since 2018, when you pled guilty to Federal crimes and you were sentenced for those Federal crimes, have you applied to the Court in the Southern District to receive a reduction in the sentence that you received there in that Federal Court?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Have you and your attorneys, at times, asked our Office to provide you with a letter detailing your cooperation with our Office, your providing information to us on a number of occasions at our request?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: And was that to assist you for your request in seeking a reduction in your sentence for those Federal crimes?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: In the year 20 -- withdrawn. In 2021, was it your understanding that our Office said we might provide you with such a letter detailing your cooperation with our Office if the Southern District of New York Prosecutors would consider it in reducing your sentence?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: And was it your understanding that the Southern District Prosecutors declined to accept such a letter as a basis to reduce your sentence?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And so, as a result, did our Office ever provide you with such a letter?

Michael Cohen: No, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Despite that, have you still continued to provide our Office with information and continued to meet with us at our requests?

Michael Cohen: I have.

Susan Hoffinger: Did your seeking a letter from our Office detailing your cooperation impact you telling the truth in meetings with our Office?

Michael Cohen: No, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Did it impact your telling the truth in your testimony before the grand jury?

Michael Cohen: No, ma' am.

Susan Hoffinger: Did it impact your telling the truth here in court?

Michael Cohen: No, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: I want to ask you some more questions about the cell phones. Remember the cell phones that the FBI seized in 2018 in connection with the search warrants?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: At some point after you had returned home from prison, did those two cell phones get returned to you?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Approximately, when? Do you know?

Michael Cohen: [No response.] .

Susan Hoffinger: In 2020 sometime?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And when they were returned to you, did you power them on?

Michael Cohen: I might have.

Susan Hoffinger: For what reason might you have powered them on?

Michael Cohen: Just to see if they were still working.

Susan Hoffinger: And in the interim between when they seized those phones and you went to prison and you came back, did you get another cell phone or other cell phones?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: And were you using other cell phones at the time?

Michael Cohen: Cell phone.

Susan Hoffinger: Cell phone One cell phone?

Michael Cohen: [Nods yes.] .

Susan Hoffinger: And what did you do with those older phones that were returned to you by the FBI?

Michael Cohen: One of them remained in one of the many boxes that were returned. And the other one was in a pouch that went into a drawer with a bunch of cell phones that were taken.

Susan Hoffinger: And that bunch of cell phones, were those -- did those belong to other family members?

Michael Cohen: Yes. They belonged to my wife, my children. Over the years, accumulating cell phones.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, you said that the two cell phones were returned to you, one remained in a drawer, one was in a pouch. Did you use one of those phones for a particular purpose?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: What did you use that for?

Michael Cohen: Myself and my friend/attorney, Jeffrey Levine, were engaging in a conversation with the Bureau of Prison regarding a FOIA request that was made, ignored. So, we were on the telephone with the individual from the BOP. And I wanted to record the conversation, because we were in litigation with them as well.

Michael Cohen: So, I powered one of the cell phones up, and had my cell phone on speaker, and I recorded it.

Susan Hoffinger: So, did you use the older cell phone that you got back from the FBI to record a conversation on the new cell phone?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And at that time, were you under any legal restrictions about how to use these old cell phones that you got back from the FBI?

Michael Cohen: No.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you know in the year 2020, when those phones were returned to you, that three years later we might ask if you would surrender those cell phones to us?

Michael Cohen: No, I did not.

Susan Hoffinger: And when we asked you to provide those cell phones to us in January of 2023, did you do so voluntarily?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, did you provide the two cell phones on two different dates in January of 2023?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Can you tell us why?

Michael Cohen: Well, the cell phone that was in the pouch, I knew where it was. The one that was in the box was down in the storage area, and I needed to go find it.

Susan Hoffinger: So, did it take you a couple of days to go find it?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you provide those two cell phones to us powered off?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you provide passwords to us for those phones?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: Based on our request?

Michael Cohen: Based off of your request.

Susan Hoffinger: And you did SO voluntarily?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: At any time with respect to -- withdrawn. At any time, did you alter or modify the audio recording of your conversation with Mr. Trump that was contained in People's 246?

Michael Cohen: No, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Mr. Cohen, since you pled guilty in 2018 to those Federal crimes, have you made some public statements, in substance, that you believe you should not have been criminally prosecuted for the tax evasion and making false statements to a financial institution?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: And are you disputing the facts of those underlying charges, the tax evasion and the false statements to a bank?

Todd Blanche: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Overruled.

Susan Hoffinger: Are you --

Michael Cohen: No, I'm not. I have constantly maintained that I do not dispute the fact there was an error in the taxable amount and the tax that was due. What I did dispute, and I continue to dispute, is that for a first-time offender, who has consistently paid taxes on its due date and never having been, um, audited, that this would go immediately to a criminal charge.

Michael Cohen: From the day that we found out, I was given 48 hours within which to plead guilty or the Southern District of New York was going to file an 80-page indictment that included my wife.

Susan Hoffinger: Is that because your wife had also signed those documents?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Susan Hoffinger: With respect to the charge of false statements to a bank, are you disputing the underlying facts of that charge?

Michael Cohen: No.

Susan Hoffinger: What is it that you're disputing with respect to that charge?

Michael Cohen: That the -- that there was materiality in the, um, statement that they say was inaccurate or missing. I had the HELOC, again, which I think I explained.

Susan Hoffinger: Go on.

Michael Cohen: The home equity line of credit. I had 80 percent equity in my home. And the same bank had the mortgage. It's supposed to be a line of credit based off of your home's equity. There was ten times coverage. So, I didn't believe that it should have been brought as a charge, either, based upon materiality. I'd had a HELOC on that same property for ten years, just with a different institution.

Susan Hoffinger: Are you disputing that there was an omission, however, in the HELOC application submitted to the bank?

Michael Cohen: No, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: So, there was an omission?

Michael Cohen: There was.

Susan Hoffinger: And you just don't believe you should have been criminally prosecuted?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Susan Hoffinger: For that offense?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Susan Hoffinger: Nevertheless, did you take responsibility for those two crimes?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: And you paid the taxes that were owed?

Michael Cohen: Paid the taxes, paid the fines, paid everything.

Susan Hoffinger: And you served time in prison?

Michael Cohen: And served time in prison. In fact, I remain, even today, still on supervised release.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, Mr. Cohen, in October of 2023, did you testify at trial pursuant to a subpoena? Were you called to testify for the New York Attorney General's S Office in a case, a civil case against Mr. Trump, The Trump Organization, and some other executives at the Trump Organization?

Michael Cohen: I was.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you testify over the course of two days?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: And in connection with your testimony, were you also cross-examined by Mr. Trump's lawyers in that case?

Michael Cohen: I was.

Susan Hoffinger: And, in particular, were you asked -- withdrawn. In particular, were you cross-examined about statements that you said you'd made publicly -- I see Mr. Blanche is rising.

Todd Blanche: Sorry.

Susan Hoffinger: It's all right. Would you like to approach?

Todd Blanche: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Come up.

Note: [Whereupon, the following proceedings were held at sidebar.]

Todd Blanche: Judge, in opening statements, when I started talking about this incident, you sustained an objection because the People represented that -- because the People represented to your Honor that it was argument. And now they're trying to elicit it from this witness on direct. I am definitely getting into it on cross.

Todd Blanche: This seems appropriate for them on redirect, not on direct. I wasn't able to open on this. The objection was sustained on this.

Susan Hoffinger: I just intend to elicit why he told the Court under cross-examination that he had lied to Judge Pauley in terms of his criminal plea. That's all. I'm not getting into anything further, but I'm going to have him explain why he told -- he testified in that case that he had lied to Judge Pauley. It's consistent with what he testified to.

Todd Blanche: I'm not trying to cry over spilled milk. That was exactly what was sustained on opening, that he had lied under oath to Judge Pauley.

Susan Hoffinger: You said "committed perjury".

Juan Merchan: You called him a "perjurer" when he said that. I think you did.

Todd Blanche: He admitted he committed perjury.

Susan Hoffinger: He did not. He said he lied to Judge Pauley.

Juan Merchan: It was a fine line. It was the use of the word "perjury" or "perjurer" that I sustained.

Todd Blanche: Fine. I withdraw my objection. I needed to get that off my chest.

Note: [Whereupon, the following proceedings were held in open court.]

Juan Merchan: The objection is withdrawn.

Susan Hoffinger: Mr. Cohen, in particular, were you cross-examined about statements that you've made about feeling that it was unfair for you to have been criminally prosecuted for tax evasion and a false statement to the bank?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: And did Mr. Trump's lawyers ask you -- withdrawn. Did Mr. Trump's lawyers ask you if as a result of those public statements you had made, that you had, therefore, lied in August of 2018 before the Judge who took your plea, meaning that you had lied in taking a criminal plea to tax evasion and bank fraud?

Michael Cohen: Yes, they did ask that.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you admit under questioning that, yes, you told Judge Pauley that it was a lie when you agreed to plead guilty to those counts?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Can you explain, very briefly, what you meant when you said, yes, you lied to Judge Pauley when you took that criminal plea to those counts in 2018?

Michael Cohen: What I was saying: I was going to take responsibility because the underlying fact I have never disputed. But, it goes back, again, to the issue that I was given 48 hours to accept their plea offer or they were going to file an 80-page indictment that included my wife. And I was going to protect my wife.

Susan Hoffinger: And, now, just to make sure that I'm clear, you've never said that you lied to Judge Pauley about your plea to the two campaign finance violations, is that right?

Todd Blanche: Objection.

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Juan Merchan: Sustained as to form. The answer is stricken.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you ever lie in connection with your guilty plea or any other time about whether you were guilty of those campaign finance violations?

Michael Cohen: No, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Mr. Cohen, are you still a practicing attorney?

Michael Cohen: No, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Why not?

Michael Cohen: I lost my law license as a direct result of this.

Susan Hoffinger: As a result of your felony pleas?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: How many years, in total, did you practice law before you were disbarred?

Michael Cohen: Thirty.

Susan Hoffinger: Over the years while you were practicing law, you said you had some businesses, is that right?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Susan Hoffinger: Do you still have the taxi medallion business that you testified about?

Michael Cohen: No, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: And do you still -- just briefly, did you sell off those businesses, the taxi medallion business?

Michael Cohen: Two separate times. 2002, I sold a management company which I had 15 percent interest to my ex partner, but I retained the medallions as an asset. As a result of the felony conviction, felons are not allowed to own New York City taxi medallions, SO I had to sell those. The same holds true to the taxi medallions I owned in Chicago.

Susan Hoffinger: You mentioned you previously owned some real estate. Have you sold much of that?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Do you still retain some real estate?

Michael Cohen: No. Only one secondary apartment.

Susan Hoffinger: As well as your own apartment?

Michael Cohen: As well as my primary residence. All the rest I had to sell.

Susan Hoffinger: After pleading guilty to those felonies and being disbarred from practicing law, what type of work have you been able to be engaged in now?

Michael Cohen: Predominantly, it's media and entertainment.

Susan Hoffinger: Tell us a little bit about that. What kind of media and entertainment do you engage in?

Michael Cohen: While I was on home confinement, I started my first podcast called Mea Culpa.

Susan Hoffinger: What does that term, "Mea Culpa", mean?

Michael Cohen: Well, I named it Mea Culpa for two reasons. The first is, it means it's my responsibility, which I take. The second is because it's my initials.

Susan Hoffinger: Your podcast, Mea Culpa, what do you discuss on those podcasts?

Michael Cohen: News of the day.

Susan Hoffinger: Do you also spend a good deal of time on those podcasts discussing Mr. Trump?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Susan Hoffinger: And your experiences with him?

Michael Cohen: I do

Susan Hoffinger: And do you make money as a result of that podcast?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Do you also have another podcast?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Susan Hoffinger: And do you make money from that, as well?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Do you also on that podcast discuss -- frequently on that podcast discuss President Trump?

Michael Cohen: That is also a news podcast. I do that with MeidasTouch and Ben Meiselas. The format is different topics. It's for YouTube.

Susan Hoffinger: Among other topics, did you discuss Mr. Trump?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Susan Hoffinger: Have you written two books?

Michael Cohen: I have.

Susan Hoffinger: What was the first book you wrote?

Michael Cohen: Disloyal, which was a memoir.

Susan Hoffinger: When did you write that?

Michael Cohen: While in prison.

Susan Hoffinger: Why did you write that book?

Michael Cohen: In order to pass the time. When you're in prison, time management is very important. It helps to make the time go quicker.

Susan Hoffinger: What is that book about?

Michael Cohen: The book is about many different things. It's about life, growing up, my wife, and experiences while working for Mr. Trump at the Trump Organization.

Susan Hoffinger: So, was a large part of that book about your experiences with Mr. Trump?

Michael Cohen: Yes

Susan Hoffinger: And what about the book Revenge -- and you made some money from that book, by the way, Disloyal?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: What about the book Revenge, what is that about?

Michael Cohen: Revenge is -- as I characterized it, it's about the prosecution against me by the Southern District of New York. I refer to it as a forensic dissection of a corrupt prosecution against -- or a weaponization of the Justice Department by -- against a critic of the President's.

Susan Hoffinger: And are there portions of that book that are also related to Mr. Trump?

Michael Cohen: There were portions, yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And have you made some money from that book, as well?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: And are these endeavors that you've engaged in conducted, largely, to support your family?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: By the way, do you also -- in terms of your podcasts, do you make money by having advertisers, is that how you make money?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Have you also sold some merchandise?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Does that merchandise often have something to do with Mr. Trump?

Michael Cohen: Um, there is one that is reflective of Mr. Trump. The others are just the name or a picture of myself.

Susan Hoffinger: In February of 2021, did you invite Stormy Daniels onto your podcast, Mea Culpa?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: And why did you do that?

Michael Cohen: I thought it was time to speak to her. I had never spoken to her before. I never communicated with her before. And I thought it would be a good time to speak to her and mea culp, to apologize.

Susan Hoffinger: Apologize to her?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you do that?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: Was that the first time you've ever spoken to Stormy Daniels?

Michael Cohen: I believe SO. & In person?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you invite her once more on another podcast?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: Have you continued to be on the receiving end of Mr. Trump, of President Trump and his public comments about you?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Around the time that you testified in the grand jury in this case, were you aware of Mr. Trump posting negative comments about you on Truth Social?

Michael Cohen: I was. Yeah, I was.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we put up People's Exhibit 408A, please, in evidence.

Note: [Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.]

Susan Hoffinger: Can you -- do you notice the reference here to "convicted liar and felon, jailbird Michael Cohen, may have schemed up"?

Michael Cohen: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Hoffinger: Do you understand that to be a reference to you at the time, in March of 2023?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Was that around the time that you were testifying in the grand jury in this matter?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Is that just a representative sample of some of the public statements that Mr. Trump has made about you on Truth Social and elsewhere?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Have there been many others that have been directed to you?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: In April of 2023 --

Susan Hoffinger: You can take that down. Thank you very much.

Susan Hoffinger: On April 12th of 2023, eight days after Mr. Trump was charged here, did he file a lawsuit against you in Florida?

Michael Cohen: He did.

Susan Hoffinger: How much did he sue you for?

Michael Cohen: Half a billion dollars.

Susan Hoffinger: Did his complaint against you also include claims based on your testifying in the grand jury here?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And what, if any, effect did that lawsuit have on you?

Michael Cohen: Financial, as well as emotional.

Susan Hoffinger: Ultimately, what happened with that case?

Michael Cohen: Ultimately

Susan Hoffinger: Actually, I'm going to direct your attention to one question. Ultimately, did Mr. Trump -- did he -- withdrawn. Ultimately, did Mr. Trump dismiss that case against you?

Michael Cohen: He did.

Susan Hoffinger: Without telling us why.

Michael Cohen: [Nods yes.]

Susan Hoffinger: Mr. Cohen, do you have any regrets about your past work and your association with Donald Trump?

Michael Cohen: I do

Susan Hoffinger: What are they?

Michael Cohen: I regret doing things for him that I should not have: lying, bullying people in order to effectuate a goal. I don't regret working at the Trump Organization, 'cause, as I expressed before, some very interesting, great times. But, to a -- to keep the loyalty and to do the things that he had asked me to do, I violated my moral compass.

Michael Cohen: And I suffered the penalty. As has my family.

Susan Hoffinger: Nothing further, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: Jurors, let's go ahead and take our lunch recess at this time. I remind you of all of the admonitions, including: Do not discuss this case either among yourselves or anyone else. Continue to keep an open mind as to the defendant's guilt or innocence. Do not express or form an opinion as to the defendant's guilt or innocence.

Juan Merchan: I'll see you at 2:15.

Note: [Whereupon, the jurors and the alternate jurors are excused.]

Juan Merchan: You can step down, Mr. Cohen.

Note: [Whereupon, the witness is excused.]

Note: [Whereupon, a luncheon recess is taken.]

Note: [Whereupon, Senior Court Reporter Lisa Kramsky relieves Senior Court Reporter Laurie Eisenberg after the luncheon recess, when the case was called in the afternoon session, and the transcript continues on the following page.]

Note: [Afternoon session.]

Juan Merchan: Good afternoon. Can we get the witness.

Court Reporter: Witness entering.

Note: [The witness Michael D. Cohen enters the courtroom and resumed the witness stand.]

Juan Merchan: All right. Mr. Cohen, good afternoon. You are reminded that you are still under oath.

Michael Cohen: Yes, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: All right. Let's get the jury, please.

Court Reporter: All rise. Jury entering.

Note: [Jury enters.]

Juan Merchan: You may be seated.

Court Clerk: Case on trial continued. All jurors are present and properly seated.

Juan Merchan: Mr. Blanche, you may inquire.

Todd Blanche: May I inquire?

Juan Merchan: Yes.

Note: [Continued cross examination by Todd Blanche]

Todd Blanche: Mr. Cohen, my name is Todd Blanche. You and I have never spoken or met before, have we?

Michael Cohen: We have not.

Todd Blanche: But you know who I am, don't you?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Todd Blanche: As a matter of fact, on April 23rd, SO after the trial started in this case, you went on TikTok and called me a "Crying Little Shit," didn't you?

Michael Cohen: Sounds like something I would say.

Susan Hoffinger: Objection, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: Sustained. Sustained.

Todd Blanche: Do you remember on April 20th, which is again after this trial started, you commented about myself and Ms. Necheles about this case, correct?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: Sustained. Please approach.

Note: [At Sidebar.]

Juan Merchan: Why are you making this about yourself?

Susan Hoffinger: Your Honor --

Court Reporter: One at a time, please. I did not hear you, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: I said, why are you making this about yourself?

Todd Blanche: I'm not making it about myself, your Honor. I have a right to show this witness's bias, and he has expressed bias about the lawyers just because of who we represent.

Juan Merchan: Well --

Todd Blanche: I mean, Judge, it's crystal clear under Rule 613 that we are allowed to prove --

Juan Merchan: I can't hear you.

Todd Blanche: It's clear under Rule 615 that we are allowed to prove bias in whatever form. It doesn't just matter if it's bias directed at the defendant. It can be bias about the lawyers on the case as well, of course.

Susan Hoffinger: That's not true. It's not admissible if it's not about the defendant.

Juan Merchan: It doesn't matter if he has bias towards you, it doesn't matter. The issue is whether he has bias towards the defendant. Don't make it about myself.

Todd Blanche: I'm not trying to make it about myself, your Honor. I am just trying to show his bias toward the defendant.

Juan Merchan: Just don't make it about yourself. I am going to sustain the objection and instruct the jury. Please, don't make it about yourself.

Note: [Sidebar concluded.]

Susan Hoffinger: Judge, I would ask --

Juan Merchan: The objection is sustained.

Susan Hoffinger: Judge, I would ask that the question be stricken.

Juan Merchan: The question is stricken from the record.

Note: [Continued cross examination by Todd Blanche]

Todd Blanche: Mr. Cohen, you have been following what's happening in this trial, correct?

Michael Cohen: To some extent, yes.

Todd Blanche: Well, you know, for example, details around the jury selection process, correct?

Michael Cohen: I have made comments about the jury selection.

Todd Blanche: Sir, I'm not asking you if you made comments, I'm asking if you know, if you learned about certain things that happened during the jury selection process?

Susan Hoffinger: I'm going to object, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Todd Blanche: Now, on April 23rd of this year, so after the trial started, you said that you had actually heard what a witness had testified about, correct?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: Overruled. You can answer.

Michael Cohen: It' S possible, yes.

Todd Blanche: Well, do you recall testifying -- do you recall saying on TikTok, on April 23rd, and that's when Mr. Pecker was still on the stand, that from everything that you heard from people today, David Pecker is corroborating what you have been saying for six years. Do you recall saying that?

Michael Cohen: I do, yes.

Todd Blanche: And that's because you heard from people about what Mr. Pecker had testified to in this trial, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes, somebody had called me and told me that Mr. Pecker had corroborated what I have been saying for a long time.

Todd Blanche: And it's true that you also have been following what's happening in this courtroom on CNN and MSNBC, correct?

Michael Cohen: I have seen CNN and MSNBC, but I am not following the trial.

Todd Blanche: Well, Mr. Cohen, you have been watching CNN and MSNBC during this trial, correct?

Michael Cohen: I have been on CNN and -- I have watched CNN and MSNBC, but not religiously, in order to follow the full extent of the trial.

Todd Blanche: And you have said that you are watching on CNN and MSNBC -- maybe not all the time -- about some of the things that are happening during this trial, correct?

Michael Cohen: I have turned it on, yes.

Todd Blanche: And that's because this trial is important to you, correct?

Michael Cohen: I do it because at times there are other issues as well that I'm interested in seeing what's happening, like the protests or Israel and this issue comes up as well.

Todd Blanche: Well, is this trial important to you, Mr. Cohen?

Michael Cohen: Personally, yes.

Todd Blanche: You also talked on social media during this trial about President Trump, have you not?

Michael Cohen: Sounds correct, yes.

Todd Blanche: So, for example, on April 23rd, which is after the trial started, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: You referred to President Trump as a "Dictator Douche Bag," didn't you?

Michael Cohen: Sounds like something I said.

Todd Blanche: And on that same TikTok, SO again on April 23rd, you referred to President Trump when he left the courtroom, you said that "he goes right into that little cage, which is where he belongs, in a fucking cage, like an animal." Do you recall saying that?

Michael Cohen: I recall saying that.

Todd Blanche: And that was April 23rd, SO during this trial, while the trial was already going on, correct?

Michael Cohen: Sounds correct, yes.

Todd Blanche: Now, over the past several years, let' S go back to -- in January 2021, okay, is it fair to say that the Government, meaning the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, have repeatedly asked you to stop talking publicly about this case?

Michael Cohen: They might have, yes.

Todd Blanche: Well, I'm not asking you whether "they might have, I asked you: Is it fair to say that the Prosecutors, maybe not the Prosecutors at this table or next to me, but the Prosecutors with the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, have repeatedly asked you to stop publicly commenting about this case, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: And you mentioned earlier today that you previously had an attorney named Lanny Davis?

Michael Cohen: Yes, I had an attorney named Lanny Davis.

Todd Blanche: And during that time period, just let's talk now about 2021, so January forward in 2021, Mr. Davis was your lawyer, correct?

Michael Cohen: Mr. Davis was one of my lawyers, yes.

Todd Blanche: Is Mr. Davis still your lawyer?

Michael Cohen: No, sir.

Todd Blanche: But in 2021 he was?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: When did he stop being your lawyer?

Michael Cohen: In 2022.

Todd Blanche: So, do you remember in early January, January 15th of 2021, there was a leak to the Associated Press, and you and your lawyer, so you and Mr. Davis, both denied being the source of the leak and you communicated that to the District Attorney's Office, do you remember that?

Michael Cohen: No. Can you identify something --

Todd Blanche: Let me see if I have something that may refresh your recollection.

Michael Cohen: Sure.

Todd Blanche: If we can show the witness, the Court and the parties B54.

Note: [Displayed for the aforementioned parties only.]

Todd Blanche: Take a look at that, at that email, and let me know whether it refreshes your recollection about something your lawyer said to the District Attorney about you and him?

Michael Cohen: I see that.

Todd Blanche: So does that refresh your recollection that in January 2021, your lawyer communicated to the District Attorney's Office that neither you nor he were the source of a leak?

Michael Cohen: That's what it says, yes.

Todd Blanche: Well, do you remember that happening? Do you remember a recollection of that happening, sir?

Michael Cohen: I do not.

Todd Blanche: So, and do you recall Mr. Davis asking the line prosecutors to report to the top?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection, your Honor. It's hearsay.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Todd Blanche: So let's talk about --

Todd Blanche: You can take that down. Thank you.

Todd Blanche: So let's go one month later. So now we are in February, February 22nd of 2021. Do you remember your lawyer talking to you about something he had been told --

Susan Hoffinger: Objection, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Todd Blanche: Well, do you remember at that time the District Attorney's Office was frustrated that when they would say something to you or your lawyer about the investigation, you would talk about it on TV. Do you remember that happening?

Michael Cohen: I do not recall that, no.

Todd Blanche: If we can show the witness, the Court and the parties B55.

Note: [Displayed to the aforementioned parties only.]

Todd Blanche: Take a look at this email. You are not on this, Mr. Cohen, SO if you could just take a look at the part that's not redacted and see if that refreshes your recollection about a conversation you had at that time?

Note: [Witness reading.]

Michael Cohen: Yes, I see that.

Todd Blanche: So, do you understand that, again, we are talking back a few years, I understand that, but February 22nd of 2021, there was concern that you were going on TV?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Can you please call up -- pull this up and make it a little larger, please.

Todd Blanche: Sure.

Juan Merchan: So I can look at it.

Todd Blanche: Can we blow up a portion of the email. Thank you.

Note: [Pause.]

Juan Merchan: Can you read back the last question, please.

Note: [Record read by the court reporter in open court at this time.]

Juan Merchan: Overruled. I will allow it. You can answer.

Michael Cohen: From this document, yes.

Todd Blanche: We can take the document down, please.

Todd Blanche: With the document aside, do you remember in February 2021, you were going on TV talking about the investigation?

Michael Cohen: I go on TV often, SO I'm not sure what the topic was -- what was I responding to, I don't know.

Todd Blanche: Would it surprise you to learn that you were on TV talking about the investigation in February of 2021?

Michael Cohen: No. It would not surprise me.

Todd Blanche: Now, do you remember making promises to your attorney that you would stop talking and stop going on TV?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Todd Blanche: If we can look at B56 just for the witness, the Court and the parties.

Note: [Displayed for the aforementioned parties only.]

Todd Blanche: Have you had a chance to review that, Mr. Cohen?

Michael Cohen: Do you want to tell me what you want me to review?

Todd Blanche: You can review just the entire text exchange on that page. And I understand that you are not on it, SO just focus only on discussing you?

Michael Cohen: It disappeared.

Todd Blanche: Pardon me?

Michael Cohen: It disappeared from my screen.

Todd Blanche: Is it there?

Michael Cohen: It's back.

Todd Blanche: Okay. Can you tell me who these communications are between? You are not on the communication, but do you see that your lawyer told --

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Let me hear the question.

Susan Hoffinger: He's reading something that's not in evidence.

Todd Blanche: You had told the District Attorney's office that you had promised that you were not going to talk anymore?

Juan Merchan: Sustained, sustained.

Todd Blanche: Mr. Cohen, do you remember, again, we are still talking about February 2021. Do you remember, at that time, the District Attorney's Office being frustrated with you that you would not stop talking to the press?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: But you continued to talk to the press, as you said a few minutes ago, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes. I continued to talk to the press.

Todd Blanche: And you continue to talk to the press to this day, correct?

Michael Cohen: About many topics, yes.

Todd Blanche: Including about this case, correct, sir?

Michael Cohen: Sounds correct, yes.

Todd Blanche: I don't want it to sound correct, is it correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes, it would be correct.

Todd Blanche: Now, I want to talk now -- let's go fast forward two years, okay, SO we were talking about February, 2021, let's move to February 2023, okay. So that was a little over a year and three months ago, about, correct? Okay?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: You were, again, regularly meeting with the District Attorney's Office about this case, correct? In February of 2023?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And you testified in the Grand Jury, you said earlier this morning, on March 13th, 2023, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: Now, prior to your testimony on March 13th, you testified earlier today that you gave two of your cell phones to an investigator with the District Attorney's office, correct?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: And that investigator's name was Jeremy Rosenberg, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And he came to where you live to retrieve the phone on two different days, so two phones, two different days, is that correct?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: And then just over a week later, do you recall that you went on CNN and told the news anchor named Don Lemon that you had been contacted by the District Attorney's Office and they had asked you to provide them with your cell phones and you had done so, do you remember doing that?

Michael Cohen: Sounds correct.

Todd Blanche: And do you remember the District Attorney's Office being frustrated and upset that you had done that?

Michael Cohen: No, sir.

Todd Blanche: You don't recall that the District Attorney's Office was frustrated that you went on TV to talk about the fact that you had turned over your phones?

Michael Cohen: I don't recall them expressing that to me, no.

Todd Blanche: Do you recall -- do you recall saying that you did not tell Mr. Lemon or tell CNN that your phones had been seized, that they already had that information and you just confirmed it, correct?

Michael Cohen: I -- I cannot agree with that, no, sir.

Todd Blanche: You -- so let me ask you this, are you the one that leaked to CNN that you had given your phones to the District Attorney earlier in January of 2023?

Michael Cohen: I don't recall.

Todd Blanche: So you don't recall whether -- when you talked about it with Mr. Lemon, whether they already -- whether CNN already had that information or whether you gave it to them, you don't recall either way?

Michael Cohen: I don't.

Todd Blanche: So take a look at B57 just again for Mr. Cohen, the Court and the parties.

Note: [Displayed for the aforementioned parties only.]

Todd Blanche: And this is a text message with the District Attorney's Office and your lawyer, again, again, you are not on these text messages, sir.

Note: [Witness reading.]

Todd Blanche: Does that refresh your recollection that you said that CNN already had the info on the phones and all you did was confirm?

Michael Cohen: No, sir. I don't recall.

Todd Blanche: If it was leaked to CNN and not by you, who else knew that the phones had been given to the District Attorney's Office?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Overruled.

Michael Cohen: Or, clearly, Lanny Davis. It could be others. I don't know.

Todd Blanche: Well, does Mr. Rosenberg know?

Michael Cohen: Yes, Mr. Rosenberg would know.

Todd Blanche: He picked them up, correct?

Michael Cohen: He did.

Todd Blanche: And other members of the District Attorney's Office necessarily knew, correct? Right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: But you don't know, as you sit here today, you're not sure whether you leaked that or somebody else leaked that?

Michael Cohen: That's what I stated, yes.

Todd Blanche: And then, again, still talking about last year on March 19th, 2023 -- which, by the way, you testified in the Grand Jury on March 13th, correct?

Michael Cohen: I believe so, yes.

Todd Blanche: So March 19th, six days later, you recall that once again, your -- the District Attorney's Office was frustrated and upset that you were continuing to talk on TV, correct?

Michael Cohen: No, sir. I don' t recall that either.

Todd Blanche: And you actually promised at that point, that you would stop going on TV, you would do no more appearances on TV until after the indictment, correct?

Michael Cohen: Again, I don't recall that.

Todd Blanche: Well, can we take a look at B58. Again, just for the witness, the parties and the Court.

Note: [Displayed to the aforementioned parties only.]

Todd Blanche: And this, again, sir, you are not on this text, this is with the District Attorney's Office and your lawyer.

Note: [Witness reading.]

Todd Blanche: Does that refresh your recollection that you promised that you would make no more appearances on TV until after the indictment?

Michael Cohen: No, sir.

Todd Blanche: So, just SO I understand, you testified yesterday about very specific recollections that you have about telephone calls, for example, with President Trump in 2016, but you have no recollection of whether last March -- SO just over a year ago, you promised the District Attorney that you would stop going on TV, that's your testimony?

Michael Cohen: What I'm saying to you, sir, is that I don' t recall even having this conversation with Lanny Davis about not going on television.

Todd Blanche: So you don't recall a year ago, making a promise that you would no longer go on TV until after the indictment?

Michael Cohen: No, sir.

Todd Blanche: But you recall very specifically multiple telephone conversations that you had with President Trump in 2016, correct?

Michael Cohen: I recall the conversations with President Trump at the time, yes.

Todd Blanche: Do you recall a telephone call last year in March before the indictment with you, your lawyer and the District Attorney's Office where they emphasized how important it was for you to stop talking to the -- to the TV and stop going on TV?

Michael Cohen: No, sir. I do not recall that either. Because I don't recall ever agreeing not to go on television.

Todd Blanche: You don't recall the District Attorney telling you that you were unwittingly helping President Trump by going on TV?

Michael Cohen: No, sir.

Todd Blanche: Now, you talked a little bit about Mr. Costello earlier today, the attorney that you were speaking with after you were raided by the FBI in about June of that year, correct?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: And you remember last year in March during the Grand Jury phase of this case, you were called down as a possible rebuttal witness for Mr. Costello, correct?

Michael Cohen: I believe so, yes.

Todd Blanche: Well, do you have any doubt in your mind that you were called down to the District Attorney's Office on March 20th as a possible rebuttal witness?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir, I remember.

Todd Blanche: You were?

Michael Cohen: I do, yes.

Todd Blanche: And do you remember going on TV that very night and saying that you didn't need to testify as a rebuttal witness because the DA determined that Costello's testimony lacked any veracity, do you remember saying that? A I do.

Todd Blanche: And then after the indictment, you have been warned repeatedly by the District Attorney's Office to not talk about this case, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: What have they said to you?

Michael Cohen: Please don't talk about the case.

Todd Blanche: That's all they said? They just call you up and say, Please don't talk about the case, that's it?

Michael Cohen: Actually, they contacted my attorney.

Todd Blanche: And when you meet with them -- you met with them, putting aside the past month or two, going back to last summer, you met with them on multiple occasions, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And when they meet with you, do they tell you, not just your attorney, to not talk about the case?

Michael Cohen: They have said it to me, yes.

Todd Blanche: So when they say it to you, not to your attorney, what do they say?

Michael Cohen: Probably better off if you don't speak about it.

Todd Blanche: They say it's probably better off if you don't speak about it?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: Overruled.

Michael Cohen: That's how I recall it, yes.

Todd Blanche: So they don't direct you not to speak, they just say it's probably better you don't speak?

Michael Cohen: Well, I do have the First Amendment right. I can speak.

Todd Blanche: I'm not asking you about your First Amendment rights, Mr. Cohen, I'm asking you what these Prosecutors say to you about not speaking to the press, and your testimony was they just say, probably better if you don't speak?

Michael Cohen: They say it in a manner where they're asking me not to speak.

Todd Blanche: And on how many occasions over the past year, SO since the indictment, have they said to you directly, not through your lawyer, you directly, do not speak to the press?

Michael Cohen: I don't recall.

Todd Blanche: Well, I won't give you, not an exact number, do you think it's more than five?

Michael Cohen: I don't think so, no.

Todd Blanche: So fewer than five times?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: And on all those five times, they said something like, it 's, probably better you don't talk or don't talk to the press, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And you have not followed their request, or whatever words you want me to use for what they're saying to you?

Michael Cohen: That's correct. I'm responding to comments that I make and also --

Todd Blanche: I'm not asking you that. I'm asking you a yes or no question. Now, is it fair to say that you've responded during the course of this case, SO since the indictment, but also during the investigation -- during the investigation, you' ve gone on TV several dozen times, is that fair?

Michael Cohen: I don't know about several dozen times, but I have gone on television.

Todd Blanche: Well, is it more than 20?

Michael Cohen: Could be.

Todd Blanche: Well, do you have any doubt in your mind that it' S more than 20, sir?

Michael Cohen: No.

Todd Blanche: So when you say it "could be, you mean, yes, it is more than 20?

Michael Cohen: Yes, could be.

Todd Blanche: And you've also recorded hundreds of episodes of the Podcast you just talked about earlier today?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: You do that Podcast twice a week, is that right?

Michael Cohen: Each Podcast is done twice a week.

Todd Blanche: So that's four Podcasts a week?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And is that -- I mean, is that all year long or are there breaks?

Michael Cohen: All year long.

Todd Blanche: So that's about, how many a month? About 15 to 20 a month depending? Do you always do two a week?

Michael Cohen: Uh-huh, correct.

Todd Blanche: So it' S fair to say that you have done hundreds of Podcast episodes during the investigation and during the charges since the case has been charged, correct?

Michael Cohen: I don' 't know about hundreds, but, yes, the math is the math.

Todd Blanche: Well, we can do the math?

Michael Cohen: Okay.

Todd Blanche: I mean, if there's 16 a month? A Right.

Todd Blanche: Ten months is 160, right?

Michael Cohen: Then it would be 160.

Todd Blanche: So -- and this investigation didn't just start a year ago, did it?

Michael Cohen: No, it did not.

Todd Blanche: So when I say hundreds, it's more than 200, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: Now, and of those more than 200 episodes, would you agree that you have talked about President Trump every single one?

Michael Cohen: I would say he is mentioned in every one, yes.

Todd Blanche: And in addition to the Podcasts, which we will talk about a little bit more in a little bit, you also are active on Twitter and on X, is that right?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: And you are also active, although maybe more recently, on TikTok, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And TikTok, you do a nightly live TikTok, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: How long is that each night?

Michael Cohen: More than an hour.

Todd Blanche: What's the goal of doing that?

Michael Cohen: Build an audience to create a community, to really vent because I am having a difficult time sleeping SO I found an outlet.

Todd Blanche: You are hoping also to make money off that, correct?

Michael Cohen: It does make money, but it's not significant.

Todd Blanche: You don't spend a significant amount of time on your TikToks encouraging the folks listening to subscribe?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: So to subscribe they have to pay a small fee, correct?

Michael Cohen: $5.99.

Todd Blanche: A month?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: A month? A month?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: Right. So I'm not suggesting that that's the only reason you do it, and I accept that you do it as an outlet, but one of the reasons you do it is to make money, correct?

Michael Cohen: Money is made from it, yes.

Todd Blanche: So that wasn' t my question. One of the reasons you do it is to make money, yes or no?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: And on your TikToks -- let me just start with that. When did you start that?

Michael Cohen: Six weeks ago.

Todd Blanche: So for the six weeks that you have been TikToking nightly, out of seven nights a week, how many nights do you think you talk about President Trump?

Michael Cohen: Well, I only do them six days a week.

Todd Blanche: Okay. Fair enough.

Michael Cohen: I would say six days a week.

Todd Blanche: And on X, you regularly talk about President Trump, correct?

Michael Cohen: I speak about Mr. Trump, yes.

Todd Blanche: Both in response to comments, but also when you re- tweet or when you post your own, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: Now, you've also commented on your Political Beat Down Podcast -- SO you have Mea Culpa, and you have Political Beat Down, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: You've commented on March 19th, 2024, SO before the case started, but about two months ago, that you were meeting with the Government in preparation for your testimony, which started yesterday, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And you also, actually, displayed a binder, do you recall doing that, a binder of materials that the District Attorney had given you to study before your testimony, correct?

Michael Cohen: I recall that binder.

Todd Blanche: What's in that binder?

Michael Cohen: Publicly-available documents that the District Attorney's Office provided to me.

Todd Blanche: Which publicly-available documents?

Michael Cohen: I believe my allocution, and other documents regarding the case. My personal case.

Todd Blanche: So your allocution, meaning your guilty -- you had two guilty plea allocutions, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: So you mean like your guilty plea allocutions, certain materials in connection with your case, is that what you're saying?

Michael Cohen: Correct, yes.

Todd Blanche: And they asked you to study that, correct?

Michael Cohen: They gave it to my attorney. I took it from my attorney to bring home to read.

Todd Blanche: And you read it, correct?

Michael Cohen: It was awhile ago, yes.

Todd Blanche: Well, you were talking about it on your Podcasts, March 19th, so when you say awhile ago, you mean within the past couple of months?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: You've also talked about, extensively, on Mea Culpa, your desire to see that President Trump gets convicted in this case, correct?

Michael Cohen: Sounds like something I would say.

Todd Blanche: Well, sir, I'm not asking you if it sounds to like something you would say, I'm saying, did you -- have you regularly commented on your Podcasts that you want President Trump to be convicted in this case?

Michael Cohen: Yes, probably.

Todd Blanche: Do you have any doubt?

Michael Cohen: No.

Todd Blanche: So why did you just answer "yes, probably"?

Michael Cohen: Because I don't specifically know if I used those words, but, yes, I would like to see that.

Todd Blanche: And so, yes, you want to see President Trump get convicted from this case, correct?

Michael Cohen: I would like to see accountability. That's not -- it's not for me, it's for the jury and this Court.

Todd Blanche: I didn't ask what you wanted to see or not see about accountability, I said, do you want to see President Trump convicted in this case?

Michael Cohen: That's what we just said. You are asking me if I want to see --

Todd Blanche: I'm just asking you to say yes or no, do you want President Trump to get convicted in this case?

Michael Cohen: Sure.

Todd Blanche: Now, you actually -- and the Prosecutor brought this up a little bit before lunch today -- you sell a T-shirt on your website Mea Culpa, which depicts President Trump in an orange jumpsuit behind bars, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: Can we put up just for the witness, the Court and the parties B151.

Note: [Displayed to the aforementioned parties only.]

Todd Blanche: So this is a couple of pages. It's from your website. If we could scroll to the next page. The next page. The next page. I believe that's the last page, that other page. So you see that when you -- if somebody logs onto the website for your Podcast, that's what you see, correct, for the merchandise pages, correct?

Michael Cohen: It, S actually under the MeidasTouch network and, yes, if you go into the section that says "Mea Culpa, "this shirt is available for sale.

Todd Blanche: Fair enough. So under the company that runs your Podcast, there is a Mea Culpa -- which is your Podcast, correct?

Michael Cohen: That's one item.

Todd Blanche: That's what?

Michael Cohen: Some of them, yes.

Todd Blanche: There are others beyond this?

Michael Cohen: I thought there were more items.

Todd Blanche: And if we can go to the fourth page.

Note: [Displayed.]

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And if you see --

Todd Blanche: If we can blow up the bottom.

Todd Blanche: -- the coffee mug as well.

Todd Blanche: That says, "Send him to the Big House not the White House," correct?

Michael Cohen: That's what it says.

Todd Blanche: And that's also a reference to President Trump, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: So when you testified earlier today that you only sell one thing on your -- merchandise that has to do with Donald Trump, that's not true, correct?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Todd Blanche: And, by the way --

Todd Blanche: If you can go back to the first page, please.

Note: [Displayed.]

Todd Blanche: You, actually -- if you look at that, the T-shirt, you actually wore that T-shirt last week on your TikTok, didn't you, on Wednesday night?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Todd Blanche: And you were offering -- encouraging people to go buy it, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes. It's part of the merch store.

Todd Blanche: So, I want to talk for a few minutes -- you talked about this a little bit on direct -- about your views of President Trump prior to, I guess, August of 2018, is that right?

Michael Cohen: [Witness indicating.]

Todd Blanche: Well, you tell me, when did you change your views about President Trump, from the views you had for your entire life to the views that you have now?

Michael Cohen: It would be August of 2018.

Todd Blanche: Well, I will take back saying August. I don't want to put words in your mouth. When was it that you changed your view about President Trump from what it is now prior to what it was your entire life, which is different than it is now?

Michael Cohen: It was the time -- at the time that I went on George Stephanopoulos.

Todd Blanche: And was that around the summertime, July, August of 2018?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: But, prior to that -- and you said this on direct, so I'm not saying, I don't think, anything controversial, but you enjoyed working for President Trump, correct?

Michael Cohen: Very much SO.

Todd Blanche: And you first met President Trump and his family in 2006, is that right?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: And that was during a Board dispute that was going on at one of President Trump's buildings, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And you helped resolve that?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And you were working with one of President Trump's sons, Donald Trump, Jr., on that, is that right?

Michael Cohen: Amongst other people, yes.

Todd Blanche: Now, there was construction going on at a -- at one of President Trump's apartments that you had purchased, is that right?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: That -- and you paid close to $5 million for that apartment, correct?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: And that apartment was your primary residence for many years, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes, it is.

Todd Blanche: Still is?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And you still live in a building with Trump's name on it, correct?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Todd Blanche: Now, you had already invested in other Trump properties, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: You had property in Trump World Tower?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And you rented that out to somebody for $15,000 a month, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir, to an Embassy.

Todd Blanche: That was back in 2006, we are talking about?

Michael Cohen: Sure.

Todd Blanche: A lot of your family members also bought properties in Trump buildings, correct?

Michael Cohen: My in-laws and my parents.

Todd Blanche: So your parents and your in-laws both bought Trump properties, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: Was that even earlier, or was that earlier, like 2001?

Michael Cohen: The year 2000. We bought as a block.

Todd Blanche: Now, talking about the dispute that you first helped President Trump and his family resolve, the Board was trying to remove the Trump name from the building, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: There were lawyers involved, including you eventually, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: That's when you were a partner at a law firm in the City, you talked about that earlier, Phillips Nizer?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: Correct me if I'm wrong, your practice at the time was international banking, asset-based lending, high-net-worth client asset protection, general corporate commercial real estate and letter of credit transactions, is that right?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And you were -- would you say you were more in litigation or corporate?

Michael Cohen: More corporate.

Todd Blanche: But aside from your work as a practicing lawyer at Phillips Nizer, you made a lot of money in the taxi medallions business, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: You made millions of dollars, fair?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Note: [Whereupon, Senior Court Reporter Laurie Eisenberg relieved Senior Court Reporter Lisa Kramsky as the official court reporter.]

Todd Blanche: And you viewed yourself at the time -- so, again, talking about the early Two Thousands -- as a bit of a dealmaker?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: So, you used your skills as a lawyer, dealmaker, your work in business, to help The Trump Organization before you worked with them, correct?

Michael Cohen: I'm sorry. I don't understand your question.

Todd Blanche: Well, my point is, that you had success helping The Trump Organization before you started working for them, which is, presumably, why they offered you a job, correct?

Michael Cohen: Oh, I don't know if that's the reason.

Todd Blanche: Well, you said yesterday that you knew that from your work on that, that President Trump was happy with your work, correct?

Michael Cohen: He was happy with the result, yes.

Todd Blanche: And after that first result, you started working on other -- on other legal matters for President Trump, correct?

Michael Cohen: I was asked to intercede in other matters as well, yes.

Todd Blanche: And at some point, President Trump offered you a job, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And he offered you a job right then and there, you accepted, you never even returned to Phillips, Nizer, correct?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: So, you were President Trump's personal attorney when you went to work for The Trump Organization, correct?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: You didn't answer to the General Counsel at the time, did you?

Michael Cohen: No, sir.

Todd Blanche: You never answered to anybody in the Legal Department or anybody else at the Trump Organization, you only answered to President Trump? A Correct.

Todd Blanche: You -- but, your job wasn't just representing President Trump, right? You also represented his family at times?

Michael Cohen: I have, yes.

Todd Blanche: Well, I want to stay focused on the time when you started until 20 -- 2017. So, those nine-and-a-half years that you were there, you represented the family on occasion?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: That includes which members of President Trump's family?

Michael Cohen: Melania. Don, Junior. Um. I don't believe I ever represented Eric. And I can't recall if I represented Ivanka.

Todd Blanche: Putting aside -- you would also help some of the kids with various work, maybe not legal work and filing lawsuits, but, for example, reaching out to the media on behalf of President Trump's children, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And you were paid -- just focusing now on 2011 to 2016, you made about 375,000 a year in base salary, right?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: With the exception of 2016, your bonus for those years, 2011 to 2015, was 150,000 a year, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: That's what you would get in a check around the holiday season, around Christmastime, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: Now, fair to say that you admired President Trump while you were working for him?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: You admired his financial success, his high profile, his tenacity?

Michael Cohen: Very much so, yes.

Todd Blanche: You've read Art of the Deal, I believe, twice, is that correct?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: And you view that as a masterpiece, correct?

Michael Cohen: I viewed it as a excellent book, yes.

Todd Blanche: Well, you've actually called it a masterpiece, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes. Masterpiece.

Todd Blanche: And you saw a little bit of yourself in President Trump, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: Ambitious, hard-working, dealmaker, never afraid, correct?

Michael Cohen: Innovative. Yes.

Todd Blanche: And you were actually obsessed with President Trump, weren't you?

Michael Cohen: I don' t know if I would characterize the word "obsessed". I admired him tremendously.

Todd Blanche: Well, you have characterized it as you being "obsessed", haven't you?

Michael Cohen: I can' t recall using that word, but I wouldn't say that that would be wrong, but I don't recall using that word.

Todd Blanche: Sorry. I interrupted you. In Disloyal, you described -- you describe your feelings for President Trump as being "obsessed" with President Trump, with Donald J. Trump, correct? A Correct.

Todd Blanche: And, we talked a lot about when you were working for him. But, your obsession for -- you admired him even before you started working for him, correct?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: And you spoke publicly on many occasions about your positive feelings for President Trump, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: You've said -- just for some examples, in 2015, you publicly said he was a good man?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: Also in 2015, this is around the time he announced he was running for President, you said that he's a man who cares deeply about this country, right?

Michael Cohen: I said that.

Todd Blanche: That he's a man who tells it straight?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: Now, you also said -- again, I'm still in 2015 -- that, in your view, President Trump speaks from the heart?

Michael Cohen: I've said that.

Todd Blanche: And that all that he wants to do is make this country great again. You said that?

Michael Cohen: Sounds right, yes.

Todd Blanche: And at the time, you weren't lying, right?

Michael Cohen: At that time, I was knee-deep into the cult of Donald Trump, yes.

Todd Blanche: So, let me ask the question again. At that time, you weren't lying, right?

Michael Cohen: I was not lying, no. That's how I felt.

Todd Blanche: You've -- you've said about -- for example, about President Trump's memory, that it's fantastic and that you've never come into a situation where he's said something that's not accurate, correct?

Michael Cohen: I recall saying that.

Todd Blanche: This is in 2015. Just SO I understand, you're not testifying that when you said that, you were lying, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: So, in 2015, when you said those things that I just went through, you were telling the truth?

Michael Cohen: That's how I felt.

Todd Blanche: You were telling the truth, correct?

Michael Cohen: That's how I felt.

Todd Blanche: Well --

Michael Cohen: I was expressing my feelings. So, yes, it would be the truth.

Todd Blanche: You also testified a little bit on direct -- and now we're getting into 2016 -- that you served as a surrogate to the campaign, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And one of the things that you did in September of 2016 is you delivered remarks in Cleveland, Ohio about President Trump, right?

Michael Cohen: I did, yes.

Todd Blanche: Can you tell us about -- so, were you one of many speakers that day?

Michael Cohen: I was one of several, yes.

Todd Blanche: Now, when you were speaking, President Trump was there?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And did President Trump also speak, as well?

Michael Cohen: I believe so, yes.

Todd Blanche: And you remember telling the -- how large was the crowd? What was the venue?

Michael Cohen: The venue was the New Spirit Revival Church. It was run by my co-creator of the National Diversity Coalition, Pastor Darrell Scott, and it was a good hundred people there.

Todd Blanche: During your speech, you described President Trump as generous, do you remember that?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Todd Blanche: Compassionate, principled, empathetic, do you remember saying all that?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: Kind, humble, genuine, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: The same question I asked you before. When you said that back in September of 2016, you were telling the truth?

Michael Cohen: Again, that's how I felt. So, yes, it would be the truth.

Todd Blanche: Now, moving a little bit forward to 2017, do you recall a Vanity Fair profile that was done about you in 2017, in September?

Michael Cohen: I'm sorry. Can you repeat that?

Todd Blanche: Sorry. Do you recall a Vanity Fair profile that was done in September of 2017? A I do.

Todd Blanche: And do you remember saying -- and that was an article that you participated in, right?

Michael Cohen: Written by Emily Jane Fox.

Todd Blanche: And you said that you were the guy that stops the leaks, talking about who you were as it relates to President Trump, correct? A Correct.

Todd Blanche: And you said that you were the guy who protects the the President and the family, right?

Michael Cohen: I believe so.

Todd Blanche: Excuse me?

Michael Cohen: I believe so, yes.

Todd Blanche: And you also said at that point that you would take a bullet for the President?

Michael Cohen: I did say that, yes.

Todd Blanche: You also talked about, at that time -- and, again, this is September 2017. You said that towards the end of the campaign, that you were offered book deals, correct?

Michael Cohen: I was offered a book deal, yes.

Todd Blanche: So, you were offered -- I believe you said you were offered $10 million to write a tell-all book, is that right?

Michael Cohen: I believe so, yes.

Todd Blanche: And you said that -- what you said in the article is that your counteroffer was, "How about a hundred million?" correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: According to the article, at the time, there was no number that worked for you, right?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: You -- you were just pushing them to see how high they would go in a book offer, right?

Michael Cohen: No. That's not true.

Todd Blanche: No? I wasn't trying to fight with you there. You were just going back at them to say there's no number in the world that you would agree to to write a book about President Trump?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And, again, when you said that, that was true, you had no intention of writing a book?

Michael Cohen: I had no intention of writing a book.

Todd Blanche: At that time, in 2017?

Michael Cohen: At that time.

Todd Blanche: And you also said, not only about President Trump, but there was no money in the world that would cause you to write about his family, correct?

Michael Cohen: Sounds correct, yes.

Todd Blanche: You said there's no money in the world that could get you to disclose anything about the family, right?

Michael Cohen: Okay.

Todd Blanche: You described them at the time, in 2017, talking about the family, as a surrogate family of yours, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: Now, we're mid-2017 right now. So, September of 2017. And during that time -- so, that's the first year that President Trump is in Office, when you are his Personal Counsel, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct. & You were not spending as much time with him then that you had spent with him the prior nine-and-a-half years, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: So, you went from seeing him almost daily, except for when he was campaigning, to not seeing him nearly as much when he was in the White House, correct?

Michael Cohen: Oh, that's correct.

Todd Blanche: For example, you told Hope Hicks in June of 2017 that you missed him and that you missed being around the folks that you had worked with for years and years, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes, I did. I had a great relationship with my colleagues. And I did say that I missed President Trump. In fact, he said the same thing at a rally -- well, I shouldn't say a rally. It was a fundraiser in Washington, D.C.

Todd Blanche: Now, you -- at some point, because of the investigation -- you talk about, on direct, there was an ongoing investigation, and there was some separation placed between you and President Trump, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes. There was a separation.

Todd Blanche: And you spoke about that. You spoke about the fact that it was frustrating to you that you weren't able to communicate as often with President Trump or with the kids, correct?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Overruled.

Michael Cohen: I'm sorry. Repeat that.

Todd Blanche: Of course. So, now talking about 2017. You publicly spoke about the fact that it was frustrating to you or you were disappointed that you weren't able to spend as much time with President Trump's children or President Trump because of the investigation?

Michael Cohen: [Pause.] I'm sorry. Where was that said?

Todd Blanche: So, let me ask it a different way. In the Fall of 2017, okay -- so, in September of 2017, there was an ongoing investigation, and one of the consequences of that was you were told you had to stay away and you shouldn't communicate directly with President Trump or his family, correct?

Michael Cohen: I was advised that I could not speak to President Trump, but not to the family.

Todd Blanche: Well, you don't remember saying to Emily Fox in the reporting that: That's the part that's most disappointing, meaning not being able to see the President, I haven't spoken to any of the kids?

Michael Cohen: Correct. Not that I couldn't see the kids. We just didn't.

Todd Blanche: Well, you didn't speak with the kids?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: You then testified in Congress on October 24th of that year, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And this is the testimony that you talked about on direct where you lied?

Michael Cohen: That's the 2017?

Todd Blanche: Yes. Sorry. So, October 24, 2017?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: Did you lie -- you identified the areas that you pled guilty to lying about, right, involving the Russia Project, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: Did you lie in other areas of your testimony or only that area of your testimony?

Michael Cohen: I believe that's -- [Pause.] -- part?

Todd Blanche: So, for example, you testified in front of Congress on that day that you were very proud to have served Donald Trump for all of those years and that you would continue to support him. That wasn't a lie, that was true?

Michael Cohen: That was true.

Todd Blanche: Then -- we'll come back to this in a little bit. In 2018, in April, the FBI raided your home office, safe deposit box, and the hotel room you were staying in, correct?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: After that time, you had one conversation on the phone, shortly thereafter, with President Trump, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes. The day after.

Todd Blanche: Now, a few weeks later -- so, April 26th of that same year, of 2018, do you recall saying on the phone that you really missed The Boss? You said, "Boss, I miss you SO much. I wish I was down there with you. It's really hard for me not to be there." Do you remember that?

Michael Cohen: I don, t recall that.

Todd Blanche: If we can show you and see if we can refresh your recollection.

Todd Blanche: If we can look at B66 just for the witness, the parties and the Court.

Note: [Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the witness' and the parties' screens.]

Todd Blanche: It's an article. Take a look at that, and see if it refreshes your recollection.

Note: [Whereupon, the witness reviews the exhibit on his screen.]

Todd Blanche: Does that article refresh your recollection that you said that?

Michael Cohen: No. Um, what it states is that, according to this person -- I don' t know who the person is. And I don't recall specifically saying that.

Todd Blanche: Fair enough. Now, at some point -- and -- around August of that year, SO August of 2018, you started -- you decided that you were going to meet with the Special Counsel's Office and tell them what you knew, correct? Cooperate?

Michael Cohen: I was asked to cooperate, yes.

Todd Blanche: Well, you were asked to cooperate, but at some point you decided that you would cooperate, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And you don't remember exactly when it was that you decided to cooperate?

Michael Cohen: I don' t remember the specific date, no.

Todd Blanche: Was it -- so, you first met with the Special Counsel, with Mueller's Special Counsel on August 7, 2018, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: Had you decided at that point you were going to cooperate?

Michael Cohen: I don't believe so.

Todd Blanche: So, in your mind, when you met with them, what were you thinking?

Michael Cohen: Still to protect Mr. Trump, to provide answers that might have been deceptive.

Todd Blanche: And when you met with them that first time, you had lawyers with you, right?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Todd Blanche: You had three lawyers with you?

Michael Cohen: I believe so.

Todd Blanche: And there were -- there was an FBI agent?

Michael Cohen: I don't recall who was in the room. There was a lot of people in the room.

Todd Blanche: Understood.

Todd Blanche: Let's take a look at A65, just for the witness, the parties and the Court.

Note: [Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the witness' and the parties' screens.]

Todd Blanche: If we could blow up just the first paragraph.

Note: [Whereupon, the witness reviews the exhibit on his screen.]

Todd Blanche: There's some redactions there, Mr. Cohen. See if that refreshes your recollection about whether there was an FBI agent there.

Note: [Whereupon, the witness reviews the exhibit on his screen.]

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: And there were three lawyers from the Special Counsel's Office there, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: There was an Intelligence Analyst and a Forensics Analyst there, as well, correct?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: New, you told -- at that first meeting, you gave a reason why you were gonna meet with them, right?

Note: [Whereupon, the witness reviews the exhibit on his screen.]

Michael Cohen: I'm certain I did.

Todd Blanche: Well, you said, did you not, that your life had been turned upside-down since the release of the Steele dossier, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: And you said to them that there was no truth to the allegations in that dossier, correct?

Michael Cohen: That is correct.

Todd Blanche: And that you've never been to Prague?

Michael Cohen: I have never been to Prague.

Todd Blanche: That's one of the accusations made against you. Not true?

Michael Cohen: That's not true.

Todd Blanche: You told them you never paid the Russians to hack anything?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: That's true, you never did?

Michael Cohen: Never did.

Todd Blanche: You told them that by speaking with them -- so, by speaking with the Special Counsel' S Office that day in August, that was a way for your voice to be heard, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And you wanted your voice to be part of the report when it was ultimately issued, right?

Michael Cohen: I wanted my voice to be reflected that the Steele dossier, according to me, as an example, was inaccurate.

Todd Blanche: And you -- they told you at that meeting, the first meeting, I assume: You have to tell the truth?

Michael Cohen: They did.

Todd Blanche: And they told you that lying to a Federal Agent was a Federal crime?

Michael Cohen: I'm certain they did.

Todd Blanche: But, you didn't have any doubt in your mind at the time that lying to them was a crime, did you?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And they asked you about all kinds of background information about -- about President Trump, about The Trump Organization, about the campaign, about the Inaugural Ball, correct?

Michael Cohen: They asked me a lot of information, yes.

Todd Blanche: Now, they also asked you about the Trump Moscow Project, and you lied to them, right?

Michael Cohen: [Pause.] Yes. The information I gave was not accurate.

Todd Blanche: So, is "not accurate" information a lie? A Sure.

Todd Blanche: I don't

Michael Cohen: It's not -- I mean --

Todd Blanche: Is it a lie?

Michael Cohen: It was inaccurate, yes.

Todd Blanche: So, was it a lie?

Michael Cohen: I don't know if I would characterize it as "a lie". It was inaccurate.

Todd Blanche: So, in your mind, if something is inaccurate but it's not a lie, how are you distinguishing that in your head?

Michael Cohen: It wasn't truthful. Yes. You want to call it a lie, I'll call it a lie. It's inaccurate.

Todd Blanche: I'm asking you to testify --

Michael Cohen: I believe they're the same thing.

Todd Blanche: Pardon?

Michael Cohen: I believe they're the same thing. I believe that the information I gave to them was inaccurate.

Todd Blanche: But, you're not testifying today that that information was a lie?

Michael Cohen: [Pause.] Sure. I'll say it's a lie.

Todd Blanche: Well --

Michael Cohen: I'll say it's a lie. & I'm just asking questions, Mr. Cohen.

Michael Cohen: No problem. And I'm trying to give you the answer.

Todd Blanche: Okay. Fair enough. So, when you testified inaccurately or didn't testify truthfully or lied -- whichever word you want to use -- about the Moscow Project, okay, that was one of many things you talked about that day, right?

Michael Cohen: I believe so, yes. & Do you recall lying about anything else or were you only lying about that? Or being inaccurate? Whatever word.

Michael Cohen: I -- I don't know. I'd have to refresh my memory to see what the document is, but I specifically recall the number of times that I claimed to have spoken to Mr. Trump, which I was doing for his benefit and, in essence, at his direction.

Todd Blanche: But, ultimately -- but, ultimately, what the Special Counsel made you plead guilty to from your lies to Congress, right, had to do only with the Moscow Project, correct?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: And you never had to plead guilty to a false statements charge from when you lied in this meeting on August 7th, did you?

Michael Cohen: No, sir.

Todd Blanche: Now, did they also -- you were also asked on that date, on August 7, 2018, about the Access Hollywood videotape and audiotape, weren't you?

Michael Cohen: I believe so.

Todd Blanche: And you -- you testified that you -- excuse me. You told them on August 7th that you were in London, right?

Michael Cohen: I was.

Todd Blanche: You were visiting your daughter?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And that you were at dinner at a place called Lulu's?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: Then you told them, much like you testified to yesterday, that after you received the call, you made a bunch of phone calls to folks in the media, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: But, you told them on August 7, 2018 that you didn't recall speaking with President Trump about the tape, correct?

Michael Cohen: [Pause.] I don't recall that.

Todd Blanche: Well, let's put up B65. We had that on the screen. Not for the jury.

Note: [Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the witness' and the parties' screens.]

Todd Blanche: If we can turn to Page 18 of that.

Note: [Whereupon, the witness reviews the exhibit on his screen.]

Todd Blanche: If you can take a look at that section that talks about the Access Hollywood tape, and see if it refreshes your recollection.

Michael Cohen: Sir, it states --

Todd Blanche: Sir, you can't read from the document. A Okay.

Todd Blanche: Sorry. It's against the rules.

Michael Cohen: Your question to me or your statement is inaccurate.

Todd Blanche: Why is it inaccurate? Without looking at the document, if your memory is refreshed.

Michael Cohen: Yes, it was. "Cohen might have spoken to Trump about it." That's what it says.

Todd Blanche: Well, if you look before that, right, if you look before that, it says: You don't recall, but you might have, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: So, when you testified -- so, when you met with the Special Counsel on August 7th, 2018, you told them you didn't recall, you might have spoken with President Trump, but, you testified yesterday, right, that you had a specific recollection of speaking with President Trump about the Access Hollywood tape, right?

Todd Blanche: You testified about that yesterday?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection as to form.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Todd Blanche: So, when you met with the Special Counsel on August 7, 2018, that was about two years after the Access Hollywood tape had been released, correct? A Correct.

Todd Blanche: And when you testified yesterday -- many years later, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And when you testified yesterday, you testified that you had a specific recollection about speaking with President Trump that day, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: You said that you remember a phone call with Hope Hicks that President Trump was on?

Michael Cohen: I said that, yes.

Todd Blanche: And that you remembered a separate phone call with President Trump, as well, right?

Michael Cohen: I believe so, yes.

Todd Blanche: Well, do you have any doubt that you said that yesterday?

Michael Cohen: No.

Todd Blanche: But, you didn't have that clear of a recollection when you met with Special Counsel August 7th, did you?

Michael Cohen: It was being deceptive. Or, I might have. So, I left the door open because I didn't want, again, to have his name in it because I was trying to be protective.

Todd Blanche: So, at that point, if you did say that, you couldn't recall, or you might have, as opposed to remembering specifics like you did yesterday, it would have been because you were still being deceptive, is that your testimony?

Michael Cohen: I was trying to be loyal to President Trump.

Todd Blanche: You were still being loyal to President Trump at the time?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: But, you don't remember anything else in that meeting with the Special Counsel on August 7th that wasn't truthful, except for the Trump Moscow Project, is that correct?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Todd Blanche: So, you -- we'll talk a little about this a little bit more. You testified earlier today you had two separate guilty pleas in the Southern District of New York, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: One, August 21st of 2018?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And then August 29th of 2018?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: November 29th was when you pled guilty to lying to Congress, is that right?

Michael Cohen: That's right.

Todd Blanche: The August 21st was the guilty plea in front of Judge Pauley, with all the other conduct you talked about earlier today, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: After November 29, 2018, you were sentenced December 12, 2018, correct?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: Then you testified in front of a couple of different Congressional Committees in between your sentencing and the time that you surrendered to serve your sentence, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: Now, by that time, by the time you testified in February of 2019, you had changed your views about President Trump, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: You testified on February 27th completely differently than your prior public statements about President Trump, correct?

Michael Cohen: I'm sorry. Can you repeat that?

Todd Blanche: So, you had been talking for years and years about your views of President Trump. You testified in Congress that you had committed to work with him and continued to do SO. But, once you testified February of 2019, you changed all that, and you now said that President Trump was a con man and that you were ashamed, correct?

Michael Cohen: I said that, yes.

Todd Blanche: Now, you were initially supposed to surrender to serve your sentence March 6th of 2019, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And your lawyers asked the Judge for more time to surrender. So, from March 6th until May, right?

Michael Cohen: I just had surgery, yes.

Todd Blanche: So, it was because you were recovering from a medical issue, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And because you were going to testify in front of the Committees we just talked about, as well, right?

Michael Cohen: No, sir. It was because I had surgery.

Todd Blanche: It wasn't because you were going to testify in front of the Committees, as well?

Michael Cohen: No.

Todd Blanche: So --

Michael Cohen: I did testify before the Committee. But, that wasn't the reason -- the reason I was given the 60 days is because I had shoulder surgery.

Todd Blanche: Now, you -- you -- prior to going into prison in May, you had never met with the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, right?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: The first time you met with members of the District Attorney's Office was while you were at Otisville, in prison, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And you had been at Otisville since early May 2019, right?

Michael Cohen: May 6th.

Todd Blanche: And just SO the jury knows, Otisville, that's 90 miles away from here, give or take?

Michael Cohen: Give or take.

Todd Blanche: About an hour-and-a-half from New York City?

Michael Cohen: Approximately.

Todd Blanche: And you were very much looking, in the Fall of 2019, for a way to get your sentence reduced, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And you had visitors who came to see you?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: Do you know someone named Anthony Scaramucchi?

Michael Cohen: I do.

Todd Blanche: Did he come visit you in October of 2019?

Michael Cohen: He came to visit. I don't t know exactly when.

Todd Blanche: And he commented and said that you were trying to figure out a way to get out of prison early, right?

Michael Cohen: [No response.] .

Todd Blanche: You talked to him about that, right?

Michael Cohen: Sounds correct.

Todd Blanche: And between August 2019 and October 2019, you met in person with Prosecutors from the District Attorney's Office on three occasions, is that right?

Michael Cohen: In Otisville?

Todd Blanche: In Otisville.

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: August 27th, sound right?

Michael Cohen: [Nods yes.] .

Todd Blanche: September 19th?

Michael Cohen: Sounds correct.

Todd Blanche: And then in October, October 30th, right?

Michael Cohen: Also correct.

Todd Blanche: And prior to you meeting with them, you understood from talking to your lawyers -- I don't want to hear what they said to you -- but, you understood that your lawyers had communications with the District Attorney's Office?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained. Is this a great time to take a break?

Todd Blanche: Yes, sir.

Juan Merchan: All right, jurors. I'll see you in about 15 minutes.

Note: [Whereupon, the jurors and the alternate jurors are excused.]

Juan Merchan: Sir, you can step out.

Note: [Whereupon, the witness is excused.]

Note: [Whereupon, a recess is taken.]

Court Officer: Come to Order. Part 59 is back in session.

Court Officer: Witness entering.

Note: [Whereupon, the witness, Michael D. Cohen, having been previously duly sworn and/or affirmed, resumes the witness stand and testifies as follows.]

Court Officer: All rise. Jury entering.

Note: [Whereupon, the jurors and the alternate jurors are present and properly seated.]

Court Clerk: Case on trial continued. All jurors are present and properly seated.

Juan Merchan: Jurors, I just want to discuss scheduling for one moment before we continue. As you know, we're not meeting tomorrow because it's Wednesday. I also remind you, we're not going to be meeting this Friday. The last thing is, I'm told one of your fellow jurors has a commitment Thursday afternoon, SO we're only going to work until 4 o'clock on Thursday.

Juan Merchan: You may proceed.

Todd Blanche: Thank you, your Honor.

Note: [Continued cross examination by Todd Blanche]

Todd Blanche: So, we were talking about the first time you met with the Manhattan District Attorney's Prosecutors was in Otisville, late August, August 27th of 2019, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: So, you had been in -- at Otisville for a little over three months, is that correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: Early May of 2019?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: Do you recall, one of the things you wanted to talk to the Prosecutors about when you were in Otisville was what the benefit was to you for meeting with them, right?

Michael Cohen: I did ask that.

Todd Blanche: And you told them that you had been screwed over by the system, correct?

Michael Cohen: I don't know if that's the language I used, but sounds correct.

Todd Blanche: Well, let's put up, if we can, just for the witness, the Court, and the parties, B95. B, as in boy, 95.

Note: [Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the witness' and the parties' screens.]

Todd Blanche: These are notes, not your notes, Mr. Cohen. And you can -- if you can look at just the first couple of lines about -- so, there's two initial lines and then a blank space. You can look at the next four lines and see if you can make out what's read there -- what's written there, rather?

Note: [Whereupon, the witness reviews the exhibit on his screen.]

Michael Cohen: Okay.

Todd Blanche: So, you wanted to know why you should meet with them, correct?

Note: [Whereupon, the witness reviews the exhibit on his screen.]

Michael Cohen: Are you looking at the line that says: Why are you here?

Todd Blanche: Um -- I was actually looking two above that.

Note: [Whereupon, the witness reviews the exhibit on his screen.]

Michael Cohen: [No response.] .

Todd Blanche: You can put that aside, Mr. Cohen. It's fine. We'll just ask questions.

Michael Cohen: Okay.

Todd Blanche: You wanted to know what the benefit was to you for being there?

Michael Cohen: [Nods yes.] .

Todd Blanche: Which was fair.

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: The reason why -- I want to make sure I have this right. You were sentenced December 12th of 2018, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And we're now in August of 2019, right?

Michael Cohen: [Nods yes.] .

Todd Blanche: That we're talking about a meeting at the DA's Office, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: Are you familiar with a Rule 35 Motion in Federal Court?

Michael Cohen: I am.

Todd Blanche: And you understand that a Rule 35 Motion, at times, gives the Judge who sentences you the right to give you a lower sentence if certain things happen, like, potentially, cooperation, right?

Michael Cohen: That was something that Judge Pauley issued in his decision.

Todd Blanche: And Judge Pauley is the Federal Judge who sentenced you, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: So, you understood -- well -- but, you understood, did you not, that a Rule 35 Motion has to be made within one year of sentence unless certain privileges pertain, right, or apply?

Michael Cohen: At the time I did not know that, no.

Todd Blanche: At the time -- well, did you later learn that?

Michael Cohen: I did later learn that, yes.

Todd Blanche: Was it later than 2019 you learned that?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: During the time the motions -- when the motion was actually filed by your lawyers, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: So, when you were meeting with the District Attorney's Office for the first time, you asked them what's in it for you, but you also asked them for their timeline, correct?

Michael Cohen: I apologize. Timeline of what?

Todd Blanche: Well, that was going to be my question, Mr. Cohen. You asked them what their timeline was for this investigation, correct?

Michael Cohen: I don' t recall that, no, sir.

Todd Blanche: Did you want to understand from them how long it was going to take them to bring charges?

Michael Cohen: I don't recall asking that.

Todd Blanche: I'm not asking you whether you recall asking that or answering that. I'm asking you, at the time -- so, August of 2019, did it matter to you how long it was gonna take the District Attorney to bring charges?

Michael Cohen: [Pause.] No, sir.

Todd Blanche: It didn't?

Michael Cohen: I didn't -- I didn't ask that, and they didn't discuss that with me.

Note: [Whereupon, Senior Court Reporter Theresa Magniccari relieves Senior Court Reporter Laurie Eisenberg, and the transcript continues on the following page.]

Note: [Continued cross examination by Todd Blanche]

Todd Blanche: Okay. I'm not asking if you asked it or discussed it. Did it matter to you how long it would take for charges to be brought in this case?

Michael Cohen: I didn't consider it at the time, no, sir.

Todd Blanche: So, you didn't say in August 2019, "What is your timeline?"

Michael Cohen: I don' t recall saying that, no, sir.

Todd Blanche: Now, you recall that your lawyers had asked them -- Okay. I'm not asking if you asked it or discussed it. Did it matter to you how long it would take for charges to be brought in this case?

Michael Cohen: I didn't consider it at the time, no, sir.

Todd Blanche: So, you didn't say in August 2019, "What is your timeline?"

Michael Cohen: I don' t recall saying that, no, sir.

Todd Blanche: Now, you recall that your lawyers had asked them whether they would help write a Rule 35 motion with you then?

Michael Cohen: I am sorry. Once again.

Todd Blanche: Do you recall a conversation when they were meeting with you, when the District Attorney was meeting with you in Otisville, about whether the District Attorney would be helping to write the Rule 35 motion?

Michael Cohen: My lawyers may have answered that. I didn't ask for it.

Todd Blanche: I didn't say that you did. You were there when they were meeting with you, SO while you were there with your lawyers in the District Attorney's office, do you remember a conversation where your lawyers asked the District Attorney whether they would be willing to help with the Rule 35 motion in Federal Court?

Michael Cohen: I believe so, yes.

Todd Blanche: Is it fair to say -- I know this goes back a couple of years -- but the District Attorney didn' t commit to anything, right?

Michael Cohen: No, sir.

Todd Blanche: They didn't say, yes, we'll do it, but they didn't say, no, we won't, they didn't commit, correct?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: So, eventually, you met with the District Attorney again on September 19th for the second time in Otisville?

Michael Cohen: They came to Otisville.

Todd Blanche: Then, again, on October 30th, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: Then in December, your lawyers, in fact, did make a Rule 35 motion in the Southern District of New York, correct?

Michael Cohen: They did.

Todd Blanche: Your lawyer at the time was somebody named Roger Adler?

Michael Cohen: Roger Adler.

Todd Blanche: You had retained Roger Adler in August, a few months prior, is that right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And Mr. Adler put a motion in to the Federal Court asking for a Rule 35 reduction in sentence, correct?

Michael Cohen: I did, yes.

Todd Blanche: And you reviewed that paperwork before it was submitted, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: So, the basis for you, through your lawyer, asking the Federal Judge to give you a lower sentence was because of your cooperation, is that right?

Michael Cohen: As well as the earlier cooperation, yes.

Todd Blanche: So, it was the cooperation with the Special Counsel's Office, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: The cooperation with the Manhattan District Attorney's Office the three times you met with them, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And then, was it also the cooperation with the Southern District of New York Prosecutors?

Michael Cohen: I don't recall the Souther District.

Todd Blanche: I am sorry. We're talking about a lot of lawyers. You met with the Special Counsel Mueller's team, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: You met with the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: You also met with prosecutors with the Southern District of New York, the U.S. Attorney's Office?

Michael Cohen: I mean, they were there at the meetings with the Mueller investigation.

Todd Blanche: And they mention --

Michael Cohen: The Southern District of New York. It was not independent, correct.

Todd Blanche: And nobody had signed you up to a Cooperation Agreement, right?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: And, to this day, you've never signed a Cooperation Agreement?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: Now, that motion was not granted, correct?

Michael Cohen: It was not.

Todd Blanche: So, the Judge, the Federal Judge denied your request to have a reduction of sentence, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes, it was denied.

Todd Blanche: But, a little bit later -- SO now, as we move forward, we re talking about May of 2020, May 21st, as you testified earlier, you were released to home confinement because of the Corona Virus?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And, thereafter, you started speaking to the media pretty regularly, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And you started what you, I believe, called the Redemption Tour, is that fair?

Michael Cohen: Fair.

Todd Blanche: And one of the things that you did in September of 2020 was your first book was launched called Disloyal, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: That was September 8, 2020, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: Now, right around that time, you also launched your podcast that you talked about, Mea Culpa?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: Now, you, on your podcast -- that started September 14th, 2020, does that sound right?

Michael Cohen: Sounds correct.

Todd Blanche: On your first podcast, Mea Culpa, you referred to President Trump as a boorish cartoon misogynist, didn't you?

Michael Cohen: It sounds like something I would say.

Todd Blanche: And those types of comments and names continued on, every single one, throughout 2020, correct?

Michael Cohen: I'm sure I said something. I can't say that they are all --

Todd Blanche: You recall the first one in 2020 as a Cheeto-dusted cartoon villain?

Michael Cohen: That also sounds like something I said.

Todd Blanche: Now, do you recall around that same time, October of 2020, you started talking about your hope that President Trump would be convicted of a crime, correct?

Michael Cohen: I don, t know if those are the exact words that I said, but the sentiment is correct.

Todd Blanche: You think you might have said "I truly fucking hope that this man ends up in prison," "is that exact?

Michael Cohen: It sounds like my language on Mea Culpa.

Todd Blanche: Just SO I understand, this is now October 2020. The last time you had met with the Manhattan District Attorney's Office was about a year earlier, is that right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: So, you met with them three times in Otisville, you applied to get a sentence reduction, which was denied, then you were released because of the Corona Virus to your home, but you were still serving a federal sentence at that time, right?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: It's just that instead of being in Otisville, you were in your co-op?

Michael Cohen: Condo.

Todd Blanche: Your condominium?

Michael Cohen: Condo.

Todd Blanche: I believe you have headphones right to your right, and I think the parties do as well. I am going to ask you to put the headphones on. I would like to play a portion of B25, which is a Mea Culpa -- a portion of the Mea Culpa podcast on October 23rd. Mr. Cohen, I would love to tell you how to use them.

Michael Cohen: You turn the very top up.

Todd Blanche: Point it towards-- do you hear it? You heard that, Mr. Cohen?

Michael Cohen: I had heard that.

Note: [Whereupon, the witness, Michael D. Cohen, listened with headphones to above-referenced audio recording.]

Susan Hoffinger: Your Honor, may we approach for a moment?

Juan Merchan: Yes.

Note: [Whereupon, the following occurred sidebar.]

Susan Hoffinger: This tape is apparently an hour long. I could tell from the screen. I was just given the thumb drive. I haven't had a chance to review any of it. I don't have the rest of it.

Juan Merchan: She was just handed the thumb drive now?

Todd Blanche: Yes. I can just get back to this tomorrow. I am not looking to introduce a lot of things. Just two or three.

Juan Merchan: They haven't had chance to look at it.

Todd Blanche: I, literally, just gave it to them. I am happy to go on.

Susan Hoffinger: Thank you.

Note: [Whereupon, the following occurred in open court.]

Note: [Continued cross examination by Todd Blanche]

Todd Blanche: What you just heard was a portion --

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Juan Merchan: I will allow him to clarify it.

Todd Blanche: Sorry for speaking.

Todd Blanche: What you just heard is a portion of your podcast, Mea Culpa, from October 3, 2020, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: You also said in that same podcast, did you not, that President Trump needs to wear handcuffs and to do the perp walk, people will not be satisfied until this man is sitting inside the cell, do you recall saying that?

Michael Cohen: I don't recall saying that, but I wouldn't put it past me.

Todd Blanche: By the way, as of October 22, 2021, which is about a year after you had been -- you had started your podcast, you started in early September 2020. Now we're talking about October of 2021. Your podcast had topped ten million downloads, does that sound right?

Michael Cohen: I think it was more, but, yes.

Todd Blanche: You said you think it was more. The average was around 300,000 a week, is that right?

Michael Cohen: Something like that, yes.

Todd Blanche: I am sorry.

Michael Cohen: Something like that.

Todd Blanche: And you make money off the podcast, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: And then, by the way, is it fair to say that you are motivated by fame?

Michael Cohen: No, sir. I don't think that is fair to say.

Todd Blanche: Is it fair to say you are motivated by publicity?

Michael Cohen: I don't know if that is fair to say. I am motivated by many things.

Todd Blanche: So, do you recall saying in Disloyal, which is a book that you published the year before -- we' re talking about now September of 2020. You published that book, right?

Michael Cohen: I did, yes.

Todd Blanche: Do you recall saying that you had wealth, but that you wanted power, the good life, public acclaim, big deals, fast cars, private planes, the excesses and the glamour and zest for life, do you recall saying that?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: So, is that what motivates you, what I just read?

Michael Cohen: Yes, those are my words.

Todd Blanche: You also, correct me if I am wrong, loved being on CNN, MSNBC, even Fox TV?

Michael Cohen: When I was speaking on behalf of Mr. Trump?

Todd Blanche: Well, let' S do both. Did you love it when you were speaking on behalf of President Trump?

Michael Cohen: Yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: Do you love it now?

Michael Cohen: Less, but yes, still do.

Todd Blanche: So, the answer is yes, you love it, although just less now than you used to?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: Fair to say that in the first few months after Disloyal was released, you had made about 2 million dollars off that book?

Michael Cohen: Sounds correct.

Todd Blanche: You put that money into a Trust for your family, correct?

Michael Cohen: It went into a bank account.

Todd Blanche: So, after meeting with the District Attorney three times in 2019, the last time being late October, you didn't meet with them again, so you didn't meet with the Manhattan prosecutors again until January 11, 2021, does that sound right?

Michael Cohen: They didn't ask to meet with me again until that date, yes

Todd Blanche: I didn't ask you whether they asked you to meet with them. My question was a lot more basic than that. Just, factually, between August 30, 2019 and January 11, 2020, you did not meet with the Manhattan District Attorney's Office?

Michael Cohen: No, sir.

Todd Blanche: They didn't ask you to meet with them, correct?

Michael Cohen: No, sir.

Todd Blanche: Is it fair to say in your first call after you had gone from October 30, 2019 to January 11, 2021, in your first call on January 11, 2021, you thanked the new DA team for continuing their investigation, didn't you?

Michael Cohen: Sounds correct.

Todd Blanche: You told the prosecutors the very first time in January of 2021 that you had a strong desire to hold President Trump accountable, correct?

Michael Cohen: That sounds correct.

Todd Blanche: At the time there was somebody who was working at the District Attorney's Office, who is not at this table, named Mark Pomerantz?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: You started meeting with Mr. Pomerantz and others just after that January meeting in February of 2021, correct?

Michael Cohen: Sounds correct.

Todd Blanche: Were those meetings -- that was during COVID, were those initial meetings on Zoom?

Michael Cohen: I believe one was on Zoom, yes.

Todd Blanche: Do you recall that you met twice in February 2021, February 18th and February 26th, 2021?

Michael Cohen: Again, it sounds correct.

Todd Blanche: Well, do you want to see something to refresh your recollection?

Michael Cohen: Sure.

Todd Blanche: If we can look first at B73 just for the witness the parties and the Court.

Susan Hoffinger: Your Honor, may we approach for a minute?

Note: [Whereupon, there was a sidebar discussion.]

Juan Merchan: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Mr. Blanche is now asking about another investigation, another investigation that occurred in the office related to financial conditions. If he wishes to open the door, I guess the door will be open to that. Given that it is not yet opened, I would caution that if he is asking all about those meetings, those meetings did not have to do with the case.

Todd Blanche: I am not asking him about the specifics of what he spoke to the District Attorney about in February. I am asking if he did meet with them.

Susan Hoffinger: The implication is that he met with them to discuss the case.

Todd Blanche: If it doesn't open the door, I am happy to make it crystal clear it wasn't about this case. It was about a different investigation. I don, t want to open the door.

Juan Merchan: You can clarify it wasn't about the case, and that won't open the door. That is fine. That will not open the door.

Todd Blanche: I will clean that up.

Juan Merchan: One person at a time. If you clarify it was not about the case, that will not open the door.

Todd Blanche: Okay.

Note: [Whereupon, the following occurred in open court.]

Note: [Continued cross examination by Todd Blanche]

Todd Blanche: So, continuing to talk about the February 2021 timeframe. You were meeting with the District Attorney of Manhattan, but it wasn't about this case, correct?

Michael Cohen: Sounds correct.

Todd Blanche: And you didn't -- so, you said a few minutes ago that the District Attorney hadn't asked you to come and meet with them in that timeframe, right? Meaning, between 2019 and 2021, you hadn't been asked to meet with the District Attorney, right?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: If they had asked, you would have cooperated and come in, correct?

Michael Cohen: Presumably so.

Todd Blanche: And you wanted, during that time period -- and you were asked this on direct a little bit, but I want to talk about it a little bit more again. In the 2021 time period, early part, you wanted the District Attorney's Office to publicly acknowledge that you were cooperating, correct?

Michael Cohen: I would say so, yes.

Todd Blanche: Well, I'm not trying to put words in your mouth. Would you say so? Do you have any doubt that you wanted that?

Michael Cohen: No.

Todd Blanche: And you're still serving your sentence at home, is that right?

Michael Cohen: I am still on supervised release.

Todd Blanche: But your 2021 sentence is over?

Michael Cohen: November.

Todd Blanche: Of 2021?

Michael Cohen: Of 2024.

Todd Blanche: I am sorry. So, when you get home, you are still serving your sentence because of COVID. When did you go from prison to supervised release, even if it was still in your home?

Michael Cohen: November.

Todd Blanche: Of what year?

Michael Cohen: 2021

Todd Blanche: So, in the beginning of 2021, we're talking about the first five months, you're still serving your sentence, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes, I am still on home confinement.

Todd Blanche: And the rules with home confinement meant you weren't allowed to leave your home except for certain times, for certain things, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes, a certain number of hours per day that I can be outdoors.

Todd Blanche: You were allowed to go places, but not anywhere you wanted, right?

Michael Cohen: Anywhere in Manhattan.

Todd Blanche: So, what was your restrictions when you were still serving your sentence?

Michael Cohen: Other than those three hours, I was at home.

Todd Blanche: So, three hours, seven days a week?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: You were allowed to go anywhere in the Borough of Manhattan?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: Did you have to wear an ankle bracelet?

Michael Cohen: There was an ankle bracelet at first, which then became a phone.

Todd Blanche: A what?

Michael Cohen: A telephone.

Todd Blanche: So, the Bureau of Prisons tracked you on your phone, SO when you were not at your home or when you went out for your three hours, that's how the Bureau of Prisons tracked you?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: The way they knew you had your phone on you was that they would call you, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: Did they randomly call you?

Michael Cohen: They did.

Todd Blanche: So, during that time -- and, again, I don't want to get mixed up on years. Correct me if I am saying something wrong. But, during that time, the first half of 2021, you wanted the District Attorney to publicly acknowledge your cooperation, you were trying to get your sentence, even though you were just on home confinement, lowered, right?

Michael Cohen: I was looking for a reduction in the home confinement portion, not just from this, but also as a direct result of my work that I had done while I was at Otisville. In terms of work and program and credits, I should have been entitled to a year, but I received none of that either.

Todd Blanche: Just SO we understand, you're saying that you believe that there had been a calculation that was done by the Bureau of Prisons that maybe wasn't accurate, you were entitled to be released earlier, is that what you are testifying to?

Michael Cohen: Pursuant to the Bureau of Prisons you get what's called work credits as well as education credits, to which I took. I put in an application to the Bureau of Prisons as well, which never amounted to anything. And that would only be for the home confinement portion.

Todd Blanche: But, correct me if I am wrong, one of the reasons why you wanted the District Attorney's Office to publicly announce or talk about your cooperation was to help that effort, correct?

Michael Cohen: I would have used that, yes.

Todd Blanche: And the goal of that was to be released from prison early, even though prison was different, you weren't in Otisville, you were just at home, right?

Michael Cohen: I did want to be released, yes.

Todd Blanche: And you talked about this on direct, but, ultimately, there was no letter or public announcement made by the District Attorney about your cooperation, correct?

Michael Cohen: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: So, again, talking about the 2021 timeframe, you are still under the terms of imprisonment, at least until November, right, you were doing your Mea Culpa podcast from your house, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And you were meeting with the District Attorney from your house, or did you also go to meet with -- did you also go down to the District Attorney's Office?

Michael Cohen: Possibly a combination.

Todd Blanche: You were also -- you were also going on TV during that time, as we talked about an hour ago or SO ago, talking about the fact that you're meeting with the District Attorney, correct?

Michael Cohen: Yes. But I don't believe when I was on home confinement that I was doing television. I would have to double check that.

Todd Blanche: You don't remember on January -- January 17, 2021, being interviewed by MSNBC, someone named Ari Melber, you don't remember that?

Michael Cohen: I don' t specifically remember that date, but I have been on Mr. Melber's program many times.

Todd Blanche: And do you remember the next month, on February 22, 2021, going on MSNBC and being interviewed by somebody named Joy Reid?

Michael Cohen: Yes, I have been on Ms. Reid's program many times as well.

Todd Blanche: But, just SO I understand, I am talking about 2021, do you believe you were going on TV in 2021?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: And then in November of 2021, your sentence is over and then you're on supervised release, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: Can you explain what fundamentally changed when your sentence ends, given the uniqueness of the Corona Virus, when your sentence ends and you convert to supervised release?

Michael Cohen: With the home confinement for those appearances on television or to meet with the District Attorney's Office or anything outside of the three hours that I was provided access, you fill out a form to your probation officer, and you wait for approval. Supervised release is less stringent. Basically, you check in once a month on a form.

Michael Cohen: And if you're going to leave the state or the country, you just still have to provide them with notice via an authorization form.

Todd Blanche: And that the second part of what you are just talking about, that started around November of that year, right?

Michael Cohen: That started when I was returning home.

Todd Blanche: And you're still on supervised release until November of this year, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: You understood at some point during this investigative process there was a new District Attorney, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And you, at times, have spoken about that District Attorney, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And you have met in person with District Attorney Bragg?

Michael Cohen: No, sir.

Todd Blanche: Then, in October 2022 -- now we have another year gone by -- you publish your second book, Revenge, correct?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: How much money have you made from Revenge?

Michael Cohen: I don't know exactly, but I would say around $400,000.

Todd Blanche: And knowing that in the first two months or so Disloyal made around 2 million, combining the two books, how much more did Disloyal make after the 2 million that it made in the first couple of months?

Michael Cohen: Maybe another million.

Todd Blanche: You made -- I am not expecting you to be exact -- you made about 3.4 million dollars from those two books, is that fair?

Michael Cohen: Over the four-year period?

Todd Blanche: Yes.

Michael Cohen: It is, yes, sir.

Todd Blanche: So, that's over the past --

Michael Cohen: I am sorry. Four years. The last four years.

Todd Blanche: Yes. Thank you. So, after you publish the book Revenge -- by the way, you talk about in that book your frustration about Trump not being prosecuted, don't you?

Michael Cohen: I say things like that, yes.

Todd Blanche: And you say, for example, you don't understand why nobody will hold Donald Trump responsible, right?

Michael Cohen: That sounds correct, yes.

Todd Blanche: And you talk about in your book, about your efforts at cooperating with the Special Counsel and with the Manhattan District Attorney's Office?

Michael Cohen: I talk about my cooperation with them, yes.

Todd Blanche: Now, in that book, you call yourself a "fixer," right?

Michael Cohen: I probably referenced it, yes.

Todd Blanche: But, when you think of yourself as a "fixer," are you fixing things that you broke?

Michael Cohen: No, sir.

Todd Blanche: There came a time when you became concerned that the new District Attorney was circulating negative stories about you?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: Overruled.

Michael Cohen: Can you repeat that?

Todd Blanche: Did there come a time when you became concerned that the new District Attorney was circulating negative stories about you?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: And you talked about that in your book, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: And you said that the articles were saying people familiar with Bragg's thinking were circulating stories about you?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Todd Blanche: Now, we talked a little bit earlier about that time period just over a year and three months ago, SO January of 2023, that's towards the end of that month, when you turned over your phones to the District Attorney's Office, right?

Michael Cohen: I am sorry, I am confused by your question.

Todd Blanche: We talked about earlier January 2023, SO a year and three months ago, that's when you gave your phones -- consented to have the District Attorney's Office come and get your phones and take them, right?

Michael Cohen: Yes.

Todd Blanche: You gave them your password?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Todd Blanche: You signed a Consent Form?

Michael Cohen: I did.

Todd Blanche: And an Investigator Rosenberg came twice, the first time and a few days later, and got both your phones?

Michael Cohen: Correct.

Todd Blanche: It was around that time, a little before the end of January, that you started texting regularly with Investigator Rosenberg, correct?

Michael Cohen: No, sir, I would disagree with that characterization of "regularly.'

Juan Merchan: Mr. Blanche, this might be a good time to stop.

Todd Blanche: Absolutely.

Juan Merchan: You are going into a new area?

Todd Blanche: I am.

Juan Merchan: Let's stop now. Jurors, I ask you, please, not to talk either among yourselves or with anyone else about anything related to the case. Please continue to keep an open mind.

Juan Merchan: You may be seated. Sir, you can step down.

Note: [Witness leaving courtroom.]

Juan Merchan: Counsel, please approach.

Note: [Whereupon, there was an off-the-record discussion held at the bench between the Court and counsel.]

Juan Merchan: Let's just put on the record what we were discussing at the bench. I was asking Mr. Blanche if at that point he still thought it would be possible he would be finished with the witness by Thursday afternoon. You were answering the question.

Todd Blanche: Yes, if I finish, it's at the end of the day, I anticipate, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: Again, there is no rush. Take your time. Do whatever you need to do. You are also covering a different topic?

Todd Blanche: Yes, your Honor. As it relates to our expert witness, we put in a proposed charge today. The Government put their's in yesterday, your Honor. What we would respectfully request, that we have an opportunity to discuss the testimony to make sure that our understanding of what is admissible is consistent with the Court's motions in limine.

Juan Merchan: Does that sound like something we can do Thursday at 4, when we excuse the jury?

Todd Blanche: Absolutely.

Juan Merchan: Thank you. I will see you then.

Note: [Whereupon, the trial in this matter stood adjourned to Thursday, May 16, 2024.]
