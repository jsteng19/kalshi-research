Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Juan Merchan: All right. Let's get the jury, please.

Court Officer: All rise. Jury entering.

Juan Merchan: Please be seated.

Joshua Steinglass: Yes.

Susan Necheles: Yes.

Juan Merchan: Good morning, jurors. Welcome back. Counsel.

Susan Necheles: Thank you, your Honor.

Note: [Continued direct examination by Susan Necheles.]

Susan Necheles: Good morning.

Madeleine Westerhout: Good morning.

Susan Necheles: We spoke a little yesterday about the travel schedule. Do you recall that -- or I'm sorry, withdrawn. We spoke a little bit yesterday about the campaign?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And you were working on the RNC Hearing, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: What is the RNC?

Madeleine Westerhout: The Republican National Committee.

Susan Necheles: And there came a point where President Trump won the Republican nomination, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And after that, am I correct, that the RNC and the campaign worked extremely closely together?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: Because at that point, President Trump is the presumptive Republic -- is the Republican nominee, and the RNC wants, just like the campaign wants, to get him nominated, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Absolutely. Yes.

Susan Necheles: So you guys were basically one unit, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: That's right.

Susan Necheles: And am I correct that everyday the RNC and the campaign would jointly create a travel schedule or document that there was a travel schedule for President Trump?

Madeleine Westerhout: Whenever the President-Elect was traveling, yes, uh-huh.

Susan Necheles: And it would -- so it included everything that he was going to be doing on that day, correct?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And I want to show you and the Prosecutors what has been marked as L -- Defendant's Exhibit L8 and L9.

Susan Necheles: I apologize. I might not have set this up.

Susan Necheles: Your Honor, if it's okay, I will come back to it.

Juan Merchan: Yes, of course.

Susan Necheles: We will come back to that.

Susan Necheles: So I want you to look, then, at People's Exhibit 69 in evidence.

Note: [Displayed]

Susan Necheles: And the Prosecutor asked you about this on direct, do you recall that?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And Rhona Graff gave you this list, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And that was the list of contacts that Rhona Graff said that prior to the time that President Trump became President, that these were contacts he used in his business, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: That's right.

Susan Necheles: And these are people that were personal friends and also business acquaintances, you know, that he worked with, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: That's right.

Susan Necheles: And that's what Rhona Graff created for you, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: But there were many people on that list and, to your understanding, is that these were people that President Trump spoke to a lot before he became President, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Spoke to before he became President or might be interested in speaking to, to invite them to the White House or something.

Susan Necheles: And there were many people on that list who never called the Oval Office, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Many, yes.

Susan Necheles: And, to the best of your knowledge, there were many people on that list that President Trump never called while he was in the Oval Office, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: That's correct.

Susan Necheles: And I want to turn to People's Exhibit 70, which is an email from you to Rhona Graff.

Note: [Displayed]

Susan Necheles: And that was -- you sent that to Rhona Graff, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And you were asking whether she could pass on a newspaper clipping, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And if you turn to the next page, there is that newspaper clipping, right?

Note: [Displayed]

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And if we could blow up the top part.

Note: [Displayed]

Susan Necheles: It's a picture of the President the first time he boarded Air Force One, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: Kind of an exciting thing, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes. Exciting, yeah.

Susan Necheles: And he sent it to his family?

Madeleine Westerhout: Uh-huh.

Susan Necheles: Right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: Did he send that to a lot of people?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yeah, uh-huh.

Susan Necheles: He was proud?

Madeleine Westerhout: He was. He was proud, yeah.

Susan Necheles: And he would write a little note to the people on it, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Uh-huh, yes.

Susan Necheles: And that was something that President Trump did a lot?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: Sending newspaper clippings, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes, quite often.

Susan Necheles: And, in fact, you probably saw him do this thousands of times, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: He would send newspaper clippings of something that happened to people that he knew, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: That's right.

Susan Necheles: And he would write a little note on them, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yeah.

Susan Necheles: So, once he sent one to Allen Weisselberg, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: That's right.

Susan Necheles: Like thousands of times he sent them to other people, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And you were asked on many -- and so, when you were asked on direct, you were asked the question whether it was not unusual for him to have sent this newspaper clipping, do you recall that?

Madeleine Westerhout: Uh-huh, yes.

Susan Necheles: What you meant by that was, it wasn't unusual for him to send them to everybody, newspaper clippings, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: That's right.

Susan Necheles: But with respect to sending them to Allen Weisselberg, do you recall what happened other times?

Madeleine Westerhout: Not that I can recall, no.

Susan Necheles: This might have been the only time that he was President that he sent something like this to Allen Weisselberg, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: It could have been, yes.

Susan Necheles: And you were asked if Allen Weisselberg -- you spoke to Allen Weisselberg during when he was President, do you recall that, about checks?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And, am I correct, that you do not have any specific recollection of Allen Weisselberg and the President -- and President Trump speaking during the first year that President Trump was in office?

Madeleine Westerhout: That's correct, yes.

Susan Necheles: And you have a vague recollection that at some point they might have spoken about a check?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes, vaguely, uh-huh.

Susan Necheles: But you're not even sure that that's true, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: No.

Susan Necheles: And, in fact, you really don't recall any calls specifically between him and Allen Weisselberg, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: No. He spoke to so many people.

Susan Necheles: And I want to turn back to --

Susan Necheles: I think we're ready for -- to look at the L8 and L9 for the witness and the parties only.

Rebecca Mangold: Your Honor, we object to this and we ask to approach.

Juan Merchan: Sure.

Juan Merchan: Yes? I'm happy to get to see you all so much.

Joshua Steinglass: We have several papers with this exhibit. I broke this again, Judge. I'm sorry. I think maybe some glue. I'm going to bring some glue.

Juan Merchan: Good idea.

Joshua Steinglass: I think that there are several problems with this. First of all -- and I think that this is unlike some of the exhibits that the defense used on cross-examination because they were responsive. This is totally outside of the scope of the direct. And this is exactly the problem that we identified at the beginning of this trial, which is, that they hadn't designated any exhibits, and that your Honor had precluded any exhibits that -- directed, you know, case in chief exhibits that were not designated by the following day.

Joshua Steinglass: They didn't designate any. So -- and we specifically raised the spectre of the defense trying to make our witnesses their own and back door that preclusion by trying to put in nonresponsive exhibits, which are really case in chief exhibits, under the guise that this is cross-examination. Now, this is fully beyond the scope of the direct examination.

Joshua Steinglass: We didn't ask a single question about the President's travel schedule or the President-Elect's travel schedule. And to top it all off, these travel schedule exhibits are from October. She testified she wasn't even there at Trump Tower or working with the defendant until after Election Day. So, this is -- this should be precluded, this entire area.

Rebecca Mangold: I would just add to that, that she also never testified that she worked on the travel schedule. She said that she scheduled things in Trump Tower.

Juan Merchan: Ms. Necheles, what's the purpose of this?

Susan Necheles: So, your Honor, we are just putting it in evidence. We are not going through them. She testified on direct about his schedule, and they have been talking about his schedule. We just are interested in what happens, actually, on one of those days, actually, October 26th. And this is a document that was created jointly by the campaign and the RNC.

Susan Necheles: She was working at the RNC that day. She received these documents every day at the RNC. On those days -- she received these every day when she was working. And they were made and kept in the ordinary course of business.

Juan Merchan: What's the purpose of this?

Susan Necheles: It is to show what he was doing on that one day --

Juan Merchan: Why?

Susan Necheles: -- on October 26th. Because it's an issue in this trial in terms of the People are putting in phone documents about it, about what happened, his conversations with Michael Cohen. And this explains what he was doing with Michael Cohen. It's one document, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: I appreciate that, but --

Susan Necheles: Yes.

Juan Merchan: Why don't you just ask her about that day?

Susan Necheles: What's the People's objection to this document?

Juan Merchan: Why don't you just ask: Do you know -- do you know what Donald Trump was doing on October 26th?

Susan Necheles: She doesn't recall.

Juan Merchan: She doesn't?

Susan Necheles: Your Honor, but the business records can establish it and she can establish this as a business record.

Juan Merchan: She was there at the time?

Susan Necheles: Yes, she was there at the time. She worked for the RNC.

Juan Merchan: Who created this?

Susan Necheles: The RNC and the campaign jointly created it.

Juan Merchan: She didn't say that.

Susan Necheles: She will. I haven't been able to ask her questions about it yet.

Juan Merchan: You are getting close?

Susan Necheles: Yes, I haven't been able to ask her about this yet. We weren't able to put it up on the screen. I was about to establish a business record foundation. That's what I'm doing, what I was going to do right now.

Joshua Steinglass: This is exactly the problem. We did not ask a single question about scheduling or the work that she did prior to the election. Ms. Necheles asked about scheduling and meetings in January. But this door is not opened. This is -- this is vintage, and an end run around your Honor's ruling, and it should not be countenanced.

Susan Necheles: Judge, I have to say also, these documents are not like a surprise to the People. They came to us in discovery. It's not like I'm showing documents that they have never seen before.

Juan Merchan: But the issue is whether you intended to put them in all along.

Susan Necheles: I actually just thought about this last night. We never intended to put it in before. I thought of this last night. I never thought of putting it in before then.

Juan Merchan: You need to lay a rock solid foundation. If you can even lay the foundation for this, then I will allow it. But if you are unable to, then it's not coming in.

Susan Hoffinger: Those are ours. Thanks.

Note: [Continued direct examination by Susan Necheles.]

Susan Necheles: Ms. Westerhout, do you recognize that document in front of you?

Madeleine Westerhout: I do, yes.

Susan Necheles: And are -- were those -- is that a travel schedule that was created by the Trump campaign and the RNC jointly?

Madeleine Westerhout: It appears to be, yes.

Susan Necheles: And were those travel schedules created every day that President Trump was traveling during the campaign?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And were they shared with the RNC and the campaign?

Madeleine Westerhout: I believe so, yes.

Susan Necheles: And you were working at the RNC at that point, am I correct?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And would you receive these travel schedules?

Madeleine Westerhout: I don't believe I personally received them.

Susan Necheles: But, would you see them?

Madeleine Westerhout: Probably, yes.

Susan Necheles: And you saw them during the course of the -- when you were working at the RNC, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And when you say "probably," you are not sure whether you saw these exact ones, correct?

Madeleine Westerhout: That's right, uh-huh.

Susan Necheles: But you saw the travel schedules on a regular basis, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Uh-huh, yeah.

Susan Necheles: And you knew that they were created in the ordinary course of business of the RNC and the campaign, correct?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And you knew that they were kept in the ordinary course of business of the RNC and the campaign, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: That's right.

Susan Necheles: And it was the ordinary course of business for the RNC and the campaign jointly to create and keep these records, correct?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: I offer them in evidence, your Honor.

Rebecca Mangold: May I voir dire, your Honor?

Juan Merchan: Yes.

Note: [Voir dire examination by Rebecca Mangold.]

Rebecca Mangold: Ms. Westerhout, do you have any specific recollection of seeing these documents?

Madeleine Westerhout: Umm, yes.

Rebecca Mangold: These particular documents in front of you?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes. My lawyer showed it to me.

Rebecca Mangold: But, in --

Madeleine Westerhout: I'm sorry.

Rebecca Mangold: During -- contemporaneously with the underlying events in October of 2016, do you have an independent recollection of receiving these personally?

Madeleine Westerhout: No.

Rebecca Mangold: When did your lawyer have you review these? And, please, when you answer, don't go into any discussion that you had with your lawyer.

Madeleine Westerhout: This morning.

Rebecca Mangold: We object.

Juan Merchan: Please approach.

Juan Merchan: So the People called this witness, right? I don't know how they got them this morning? How did they get them this morning?

Susan Necheles: I sent them this morning. I called them and then I sent it this morning.

Juan Merchan: Because you intended to present it to the witness?

Susan Necheles: It just happened that I thought of it last night.

Joshua Steinglass: And we didn't even get notice of this until the witness was on the stand in the middle of questions. I mean, this is just sandbagging.

Susan Necheles: Judge, I just sent them this morning and then maybe ten minutes before I walked in here that I was able to talk to them. She did recognize many them. She said it. This is really a very last minute thing.

Juan Merchan: But you were trying to lay a foundation. You already knew that she didn't see this, and you already knew her answer. And this is not even your witness.

Susan Necheles: Your Honor, of course, I did. I, of course, I tried to present it to her.

Juan Merchan: This is something that the People asked for months before this trial, that you did not give notice of, what the exhibits were that you were going to use. So for two reasons I'm keeping it out: Reason number one, you should have given it to the People. You did not present it to them prior to her testifying.

Juan Merchan: And, two, her answers are far from that which she can establish this as a business record. I'm not allowing it in.

Emil Bove: Judge, may I respond on one issue? We are getting the flip side of this with exhibits that are being created and sent to us the night before. Judge, they are summarily giving us exhibits in that way --

Juan Merchan: We can discuss that later.

Emil Bove: -- so it should be reciprocal.

Juan Merchan: We can discuss that later.

Note: [Continued direct examination by Susan Necheles.]

Susan Necheles: Okay. Thanks. So I want to --

Juan Merchan: I'm sorry, your motion to introduce this into evidence is denied.

Susan Necheles: Thank you, your Honor.

Susan Necheles: I want to turn your attention to the questions that you were asked about checks,

Madeleine Westerhout: Uh-huh.

Susan Necheles: All right. And you were asked a lot of questions about how checks were sent. Do you recall that?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And I want to show you what is Exhibit 66 in evidence.

Note: [Displayed]

Susan Necheles: And that can be shown to everybody.

Susan Necheles: So this is an email chain about how -- about addresses, about how to send stuff to the White House, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And if we can blow up the bottom most part, the bottom entry.

Note: [Displayed]

Susan Necheles: Thank you.

Susan Necheles: And there were questions being asked about how to -- oh, that was John McEntee saying, "Can you put me in touch with Rebecca because Keith is leaving and checks need to be sent to him," right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Correct.

Rebecca Mangold: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Overruled.

Susan Necheles: And that occurred at some point along the lines when you were sending -- you know, Keith Schiller was leaving the White House, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And I want to move a little bit back.

Susan Necheles: And we can take that down.

Susan Necheles: And I want to move a little bit back to the first time when you started, when you got to the White House. And you said, yesterday, you didn't know anything when you got there, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: No.

Susan Necheles: You had been working on the transition team, but there was really no transition for you, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: That's right.

Susan Necheles: And you walked into the White House and you didn't know how President Trump would get personal items, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: No, I did not.

Susan Necheles: And you didn't know how his wife would get personal items, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: No.

Susan Necheles: And there was a lot of security about things that get sent to the White House, wasn't there?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And that includes checking any mail or items that get received, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: That's right, uh-huh.

Susan Necheles: So at some point you were told that there was a Post Office Box that had been set up for the President to get personal items, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: That's right.

Susan Necheles: And that was also true for the First Lady, correct?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And then it turned out that that was a really a slow way to receive things, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And because of the security, correct?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes, uh-huh.

Susan Necheles: And am I correct that it was also slow because things would get lost, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yeah, uh-huh.

Susan Necheles: And that some people -- sometimes you would find out that things had been sent to the White House and that President -- for President Trump personally, and he never received it, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes, uh-huh.

Susan Necheles: And President Trump told you that friends of his were feeling that he was being disrespectful to them, right?

Rebecca Mangold: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Susan Necheles: Well, he was, President Trump was upset that he was not getting personal emails or personal information -- personal documents and letters from friends of his, right?

Rebecca Mangold: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Susan Necheles: Well, wasn't that a problem, about getting mail to President Trump through the White House?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And he, President Trump, liked to return calls promptly, you testified yesterday?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And you testified yesterday that he felt like it was disrespectful if he didn't return calls promptly, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Overruled.

Susan Necheles: And so, you all tried to figure out a way that he could get his mail promptly, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: That's right.

Susan Necheles: And the same for the First Lady, that she could get things promptly, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: That's right.

Susan Necheles: And it was the same problem for Ivanka Trump, right, that she could get personal things promptly, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: I don't have specific knowledge of Ms. Trump, but probably.

Susan Necheles: And the idea was -- had come up that things would be sent to Keith Schiller?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: Right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And that is how it came to be that Keith Schiller started to receive these checks personally, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: That's right, yes.

Susan Necheles: And when Keith Schiller -- and he received other mail that was personal for President Trump, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Right.

Susan Necheles: And he also received things that were personal for Melania Trump, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: Melania Trump?

Madeleine Westerhout: The First Lady, right.

Susan Necheles: Because the First Lady also had the same problem, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And then Keith Schiller would bring in these items and give them to you, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: That's right.

Susan Necheles: And you would give them to President Trump, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And when Keith Schiller left, it was transferred to another person that the email got sent, that we just saw, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And then when that other person left, it became your job, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: That's right.

Susan Necheles: And that's what this whole testimony about Fed Ex packages was about, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: It was a way that items could be sent to you and you could get them promptly to President Trump, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: That's right.

Susan Necheles: And is it your understanding that this work-around existed in prior administrations as well?

Rebecca Mangold: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Susan Necheles: Well, wasn't it a new work-around that you all came up with, was it?

Rebecca Mangold: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Overruled.

Susan Necheles: Judge, can we approach? Thank you.

Susan Necheles: It wasn't a new work-around that you all came up with, was it? Was it your understanding that this problem with getting items promptly to the President of the United States existed for everybody who is in that Office?

Rebecca Mangold: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Overruled.

Madeleine Westerhout: I don't have any knowledge of what it was like in previous administrations, but I can't imagine it would have been any different.

Susan Necheles: Now, when you received -- you know, just focusing -- when you received whatever packages there was, you would give them to President Trump or to the First Lady, correct?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And you had nothing to do with giving documents or packages to Ms. Trump, Ivanka Trump?

Madeleine Westerhout: No, uh-uh.

Susan Necheles: And do you know how she got them?

Madeleine Westerhout: Ummm, I don't.

Susan Necheles: And you would leave whatever items came for President Trump on his desk, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: That's right.

Susan Necheles: And with respect to the checks, they came in a folder, am I correct?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And if you had -- if he had the time when you gave them to him, he would sign them?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes. If he had the time and if he was in the office, yes.

Susan Necheles: And you said he signed a tremendous amount of items, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And there were proclamations that he was signing?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes, commissions, proclamations, executive orders, memos, letters.

Susan Necheles: And that would take up many hours of his day, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: Because he didn't not like to have that in printed form, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: No.

Susan Necheles: He felt that if someone was getting his signature, they deserved his real signature, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes, absolutely.

Rebecca Mangold: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Rebecca Mangold: Move to strike.

Susan Necheles: And --

Rebecca Mangold: Move to strike.

Juan Merchan: Stricken from the record.

Susan Necheles: And, were there times, you know, with all these -- would you say it was hundreds of documents that he was signing?

Madeleine Westerhout: Not every day. But sometimes, uh-huh.

Susan Necheles: And this was in between other things that he was doing, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Oh, yes, uh-huh.

Susan Necheles: And so, would you see him signing things without reviewing them?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And would you see him signing checks without reviewing them?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And you would see him signing checks while he was on the phone, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: Would you see him sometimes signing checks when he was meeting with people?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And there were different types of people that he was meeting with, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: Sometimes he was meeting with the top foreign leaders in the world, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes, uh-huh.

Susan Necheles: And other times he was meeting with you?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yeah, uh-huh.

Susan Necheles: And so, he wouldn't be signing the checks when he was meeting with the top people in the world?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: But maybe when he was meeting with you, talking about something else, he would also be signing documents?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes, talking about the schedule or anything that had been going on.

Susan Necheles: The Chief of Staff that he would be meeting with?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And other people, he would be doing that?

Madeleine Westerhout: That's right.

Susan Necheles: He was a person who multitasked, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Definitely.

Susan Necheles: And now, I want to ask you about some other items that we are showing.

Susan Necheles: If we could show Exhibit 71. And that's in evidence. People's Exhibit 71. We can show it to everybody. (Displayed._

Susan Necheles: And Madeleine Westerhout sent you this, right -- oh, you sent this to her and it says: "Rhona, can you help me with this?" Right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And if we can turn to the next page. It's an invoice, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And this is a personal expense of President Trump, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Right.

Susan Necheles: And it was sent to you, and with the question from Rhona, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And she wanted to know what to do with this, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Right.

Susan Necheles: And in your experience, Rhona Graff was very careful about not wanting to spend the President's money without his approval, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes. Uh-huh.

Susan Necheles: And so she wanted to check with him, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: It's his money, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And so, she would send you this kind of thing and ask him?

Madeleine Westerhout: Uh-huh, yes.

Susan Necheles: And he answered it with one word, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Right.

Susan Necheles: Just "pay," right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Right.

Susan Necheles: Boom! It was off his desk, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Right.

Susan Necheles: Because he was extremely busy, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And I want to turn your attention now to another exhibit.

Susan Necheles: I'm sorry, I just don't know the exhibit number.

Susan Necheles: People's Exhibit 75.

Note: [Displayed]

Susan Necheles: Yes. And do you recall being shown this on direct, this is a series of emails about President Trump's -- about a frame that President Trump wanted?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And, again, Rhona Graff was asking questions about the price of the frame, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Right.

Susan Necheles: And just to be clear, this was -- President Trump was putting in the credenza, in back of where he sat, a number of photographs, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And they were photographs of people who were important to him, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes, his family.

Susan Necheles: He had a photograph of his father?

Madeleine Westerhout: Uh-huh.

Susan Necheles: He had a photograph of his wife and children, is that correct?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes, uh-huh.

Susan Necheles: And he wanted a photograph of his mother?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yeah.

Susan Necheles: And so he wanted a nice frame?

Madeleine Westerhout: That's right.

Susan Necheles: And those frames -- those photographs, when he would be sitting at the Resolute Desk, they would be right behind him, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: That's right.

Susan Necheles: And often pictures that were taken would show the photographs behind him, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: That's right, uh-huh.

Susan Necheles: And so, he was looking for a very nice frame, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: But Rhona Graff, again, was not comfortable spending the President's money, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: To my understanding, yes.

Susan Necheles: And so you said on direct you made an executive decision to just okay this, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes. I don't remember specifically, but that could have very well been the case.

Susan Necheles: Because when President Trump was in the White House, you understood he was too busy to be dealing with this kind of thing, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: His life may have been different before when he was just running a major company in the United States, but it was different when he was running the United States, right?

Rebecca Mangold: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Overruled.

Madeleine Westerhout: That's right.

Susan Necheles: Now, you were asked some questions about -- or -- you were in the White House, am I correct, when there came -- there was a story about Stormy Daniels, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: That's right.

Susan Necheles: And you were working with President Trump, very closely with him at that point, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And did there come a time when there was a story about Stormy Daniels in the paper?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And did you have a conversation with President Trump about that?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes, I did.

Susan Necheles: And based on that conversation, what was your understanding of his feelings about this story?

Madeleine Westerhout: That he was very upset by it.

Susan Necheles: And why?

Madeleine Westerhout: Ummm, my understanding is that he knew it would be hurtful to his family.

Susan Necheles: And that was based on what he said to you, was that your understanding?

Madeleine Westerhout: Ummm, I don't believe he specifically said that, but I could just tell that the whole situation was very unpleasant.

Rebecca Mangold: Objection. Move to strike.

Juan Merchan: Sustained. The answer is stricken.

Susan Necheles: Well, when you say he didn't specifically say that, he spoke about his family?

Madeleine Westerhout: Meaning, he didn't specifically speak about his family in that conversation.

Susan Necheles: Okay.

Susan Necheles: If I may have a moment.

Susan Necheles: I have no further questions.

Juan Merchan: Any redirect?

Rebecca Mangold: Yes, your Honor.

Note: [Redirect examination by Rebecca Mangold.]

Rebecca Mangold: Good morning, Ms. Westerhout.

Madeleine Westerhout: Good morning.

Rebecca Mangold: So, on cross-examination Ms. Necheles was just asking you about the method of sending checks via Fed Ex to the White House, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: And you testified that there were certain standard security protocols in place at the White House where normal -- for normal channels of mail?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Was the method of sending checks through Fed Ex to somebody's personal address an end run around the White House security protocols?

Madeleine Westerhout: No. Not to my understanding, no. It was just a way to get things to him faster.

Rebecca Mangold: And they wouldn't go through the typical screening process for mail at the White House, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: That's right.

Rebecca Mangold: Now, you did not meet Mr. Trump for the first time until after the election, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: That's right.

Rebecca Mangold: And was that in November of 2016?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: And you testified on cross-examination that you really had not spent any time with Mr. Trump until January of 2017, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes, not a significant amount of time.

Rebecca Mangold: And in the period of November 2016 through January 2017, in that transition period, you testified that you worked out of Trump Tower?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Did you sit on a different floor from Mr. Trump?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: And did the RNC leadership in general sit on a different floor from Mr. Trump?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: On cross-examination, Ms. Necheles didn't ask you if you had spoken to her before, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: She did not.

Rebecca Mangold: Have you spoken to Ms. Necheles before?

Madeleine Westerhout: I have.

Rebecca Mangold: How many times?

Madeleine Westerhout: Once.

Rebecca Mangold: And when did you last speak to her?

Madeleine Westerhout: Two nights ago, Wednesday night.

Rebecca Mangold: On cross-examination you told Ms. Necheles that Mr. Trump did not freak out about the Access Hollywood tape, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Uhhhh. Did I? I don't recall saying that.

Rebecca Mangold: The tape came out in October of 2016, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: And you did not meet Mr. Trump until after the election in November of 2016, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: That's right.

Rebecca Mangold: And you didn't spend any real time with him until January 2017, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Not a significant amount of time, yes.

Rebecca Mangold: So you have no firsthand knowledge about his reaction to the Access Hollywood tape, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: No firsthand knowledge, no.

Rebecca Mangold: And you testified on cross-examination that while serving as President, Mr. Trump signed commissioned proclamations, executive orders, memos and other documents, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: And it is your testimony that Mr. Trump signed those documents without reviewing them?

Madeleine Westerhout: Not all of them. But, he had people who did that for him that he trusted to prepare documents for his signature, so by the time they got to his desk, it was ready for his signature.

Rebecca Mangold: And you testified on direct that you worked at a geopolitical consulting firm?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Is that American Global Strategies?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: And I think you testified that you are the Chief of Staff for the Chairman?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Who is the Chairman?

Madeleine Westerhout: Ambassador Robert O'Brien.

Rebecca Mangold: Was he the -- was he President Trump's National Security Advisor from 2019 to 2021?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes, he was.

Rebecca Mangold: No further questions.

Juan Merchan: Any recross?

Susan Necheles: Yes, your Honor.

Note: [Recross-examination by Susan Necheles.]

Susan Necheles: You were asked just whether you met with me prior to this?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And we met for about an hour?

Madeleine Westerhout: That's right.

Susan Necheles: By Zoom the other night?

Madeleine Westerhout: That's right.

Susan Necheles: Did you meet with the Prosecutor before this?

Madeleine Westerhout: I did.

Susan Necheles: How many times?

Madeleine Westerhout: Three.

Susan Necheles: And when was the most recent time?

Madeleine Westerhout: Wednesday morning.

Susan Necheles: And those were for hours?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And just to reiterate, President Trump was very close to his family, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And it was your impression that he was very upset with this all?

Rebecca Mangold: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Susan Necheles: No further questions, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: Anything else?

Rebecca Mangold: Nothing further, your Honor. Thank you. You can step down.

Juan Merchan: People, your next witness?

Christopher Conroy: Judge, the People call Daniel Dixon.

Court Officer: Witness entering.

Note: [The witness, Daniel Dixon, entered the courtroom and stepped up to the witness stand.]

Court Officer: Step to the other officer. Step this way, sir.

Daniel Dixon: Okay.

Court Officer: Step up here. Remain standing. And raise your right hand and face the court clerk.

Note: [D-A-N-I-E-L D-I-X-O-N, a witness called on behalf of the People, having been first duly sworn was examined and testified as follows.]

Court Clerk: Thank you.

Court Officer: Have a seat, please. Just state your first and last name, and spell your last name.

Daniel Dixon: Daniel Dixon, D-I-X-O-N.

Court Officer: And your county of residence?

Daniel Dixon: Broward County, Florida.

Juan Merchan: Good morning, Mr. Dixon. You may inquire.

Christopher Conroy: Thank you.

Note: [Direct examination by Christopher Conroy.]

Christopher Conroy: Mr. Dixon, I'm just going to ask you if you can kind of pull your chair in a little bit and speak into the microphone. Mr. Dixon, are you employed?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: Where do you work?

Daniel Dixon: AT&T.

Christopher Conroy: And what kind of company is AT&T?

Daniel Dixon: Telecommunications company.

Christopher Conroy: And what is your job title there?

Daniel Dixon: Lead Compliance Analyst.

Christopher Conroy: How long have you been a Lead Compliance Analyst?

Daniel Dixon: Roughly six to seven years.

Christopher Conroy: What are some of your duties and responsibilities as a Lead Compliance officer?

Daniel Dixon: I assist with complying with legal demands. I help analysts query records. And I also help with law enforcement interpreting our records.

Christopher Conroy: In your role at AT&T, have you become familiar with AT&T's recordkeeping practices?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: Do you understand that you are testifying today as a custodian of records for AT&T?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: Are you here because AT&T received a subpoena?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: Does AT&T have counsel?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: Is that counsel here in the courtroom today?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: Related specifically to its phone business, does AT&T keep subscriber and call detail records?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: What are -- generally, what are call detail records?

Daniel Dixon: Call detail records are the records for usage between a device and another device.

Christopher Conroy: About how long does AT&T retain call detail records?

Daniel Dixon: Generally, three years.

Christopher Conroy: And when you say communication between a device and another device, is that sort of phone calls between people?

Daniel Dixon: Yes, mobility records.

Christopher Conroy: And could you tell us a little bit about what subscriber records are?

Daniel Dixon: Subscriber records is the customer information for the account.

Christopher Conroy: Does AT&T make and keep these records in the regular course of its business?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: Is it the regular course of AT&T's business to make and keep these records?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: Before testifying today, did you have opportunity to review a thumb drive containing a set of electronic documents?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: Can I hand the witness a thumb drive.

Christopher Conroy: Is that the thumb drive that you reviewed?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: How do you know?

Daniel Dixon: It has my initials and the date.

Christopher Conroy: And does that thumb drive contain a set of AT&T records that have been marked for identification as People's Exhibit 400?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: Are the records contained in People's 400 for identification call detail and subscriber records?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: How many different phone numbers do they relate to?

Daniel Dixon: Six numbers that belong to AT&T and eleven numbers that were just on our network for roaming or was in contact with an AT&T number.

Christopher Conroy: Okay. So there are records -- tell me if I get this right. There are records for 17 different phone numbers?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: Of which six belong to customers of AT&T?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: And the other eleven are just call records that AT&T captured because it used the AT&T system?

Daniel Dixon: Correct.

Christopher Conroy: Were those records for the non-AT&T customer records, do those call detail records only reflect calls that were transmitted through AT&T cell towers or calls made to or received from an AT&T customer?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: Do all of these phone records, both the subscriber and the call detail records, relate to the general time period of 2015 to 2018?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: Did AT&T make and keep this subscriber and call detail records contained in People's 400 for identification in the regular course of its business?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: Was it the regular course of AT&T's business to make and keep these particular records?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: Are the entries made on these documents made at the time that the recorded events or transactions took place or within a reasonable time thereafter?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: Is the data contained in these reports captured through an automated process and stored in an electronic database?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: Does AT&T rely on the accuracy of that automated process and the access to that database?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: And can AT&T employee capture data from the electronic database, and are they under a business duty to do so accurately?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: Judge, at this point, I would offer this as People's 400.

Emil Bove: No objection.

Juan Merchan: People's 400 is accepted into evidence.

Christopher Conroy: And just, just for the record, this is subject to the Sealing Order that was dated April 19th.

Juan Merchan: Okay.

Christopher Conroy: Now, if we could pull up three pages from this exhibit that have been redacted. And beginning with page -- with Bates stamp DANY GJ and then 60 and the number 38.

Note: [Displayed]

Christopher Conroy: Do you recognize this?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: What is this?

Daniel Dixon: A subscriber report.

Christopher Conroy: Is this a representative sample of an AT&T subscriber record?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: Do the pages you are viewing on the screen contain redactions?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: Did you have a chance to compare the redacted pages that we see here to the original pages that are not redacted, but that are in evidence as People's 400?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: Were the redacted and unredacted pages the same, but for the redactions?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: I just want to ask you about a few of the boxes in here. What does "financially liable party" mean?

Daniel Dixon: It's the person responsible for paying the bill.

Christopher Conroy: What is the billing party?

Daniel Dixon: The billing party is where the bill is mailed to.

Christopher Conroy: And if we could pull up the user information.

Note: [Displayed]

Daniel Dixon: That's the registered user for the account.

Christopher Conroy: So is it -- could it be different -- could the billing party be different from the user information?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: Why is that?

Daniel Dixon: Because the person who pays the bill is not necessarily the one using the phone number.

Christopher Conroy: Is that something you might often see in a situation where a business gives phones to employees?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: So the business might be the billing party, but the individual employee who uses the phone might be in the user information?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: What is the MSISDN?

Daniel Dixon: That's the phone number on the account.

Christopher Conroy: And what does "MSISDN Active" mean?

Daniel Dixon: The date it was active.

Christopher Conroy: So, it's sort of a date range?

Daniel Dixon: Yes, a date range.

Christopher Conroy: If we could take that down. And if we could -- I want to pull up now an example of call detail records.

Note: [Displayed]

Christopher Conroy: Do the call detail records within People's Exhibit 400 contain three different types of reports?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: What are those three reports?

Daniel Dixon: Mobility, wireline, and international.

Christopher Conroy: Starting with mobility. What is a mobility report?

Daniel Dixon: Mobility is the communication between a mobile and -- any mobile device and a mobile device, two mobile devices.

Christopher Conroy: So a phone call from a cell phone to a cell phone?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: What is "International"?

Daniel Dixon: That's when the international network was used to make or help receive a phone call.

Christopher Conroy: And what is wireline?

Daniel Dixon: Wireline is the use of AT&T's wireline-side of the network to help make or receive a phone call.

Christopher Conroy: Is that sometimes called hardline?

Daniel Dixon: I'm sorry?

Christopher Conroy: Is that sometimes called hardline? Or is that --

Daniel Dixon: Yes. Landline.

Christopher Conroy: Landline, sorry. That's what I meant, landline. Is the mobility report further subdivided into different categories of data?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: And do those include invoice usage, data usage, SMS usage and SMS email usage?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: Can you briefly describe what invoice usage means?

Daniel Dixon: Invoice usage shows the transactional logs between phone calls.

Christopher Conroy: What does SMS usage mean?

Daniel Dixon: That also shows the transactional logs between text messages.

Christopher Conroy: Does -- would that include text messages made through encrypted apps?

Daniel Dixon: No.

Christopher Conroy: Do they include iMessages?

Daniel Dixon: No.

Christopher Conroy: Generally speaking, for the two iPhone users that are messaging one another, would you expect to see those transactions in the call detail records?

Daniel Dixon: It would be a transaction that's captured in a data session.

Christopher Conroy: In a data session?

Daniel Dixon: A data session, yes.

Christopher Conroy: And when you -- what does that mean? Can you explain what that means?

Daniel Dixon: So, on our data records, we show logs of different sessions. Just a length of the session, we are unable to determine what took place during those sessions.

Christopher Conroy: Okay. And, actually, the next thing we are going to talk about is, what does data usage mean. What are some of the types of activity that would be captured in a data usage report?

Daniel Dixon: Streaming movies. Anything related to the internet.

Christopher Conroy: And when you look at a data usage report, do you just see amounts of data that was used, or do you see what that data was used to do?

Daniel Dixon: Only amounts of data being used.

Christopher Conroy: So, you have no way of understanding, you just know X amount of data was used, but you don't know if somebody was streaming a movie or iMessaging or something else?

Daniel Dixon: Correct.

Christopher Conroy: Can you briefly tell us what SMS email usage means?

Daniel Dixon: SMS email is just basically a text to or from an email address.

Christopher Conroy: For all of the different types of call detail records you just described, what time zone are AT&T's records recorded in?

Daniel Dixon: UTC.

Christopher Conroy: And what is UTC?

Daniel Dixon: Universal Time Coordinated.

Christopher Conroy: And is that true for all types of AT&T records?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: If we could now pull up another redacted page from this exhibit. And this page bears Bates stamp DANY GJ 00002822.

Christopher Conroy: Mr. Dixon, is this a representative sample of an AT&T invoice usage record?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: And I just want to ask you about a few of the columns. What does "CONN" stand for?

Daniel Dixon: Connection.

Christopher Conroy: And what is Seizure Time?

Daniel Dixon: "Seizure Time" is the moment a person hits call up until the recipient answers the phone.

Christopher Conroy: And are both Connection and Seizure Time in UTC, as we just discussed?

Daniel Dixon: Yes. The connection times is a timestamp.

Christopher Conroy: What is "ET?"

Daniel Dixon: "ET" is the length of the connection.

Christopher Conroy: And does "ET" stand for elapsed time?

Daniel Dixon: Elapsed time.

Christopher Conroy: And is that in minutes and seconds?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: What does originating number and terminating number mean?

Daniel Dixon: That means, originating is who made the call. Terminating is who received the call.

Christopher Conroy: Is one single phone call sometimes reflected on more than one row in the call detail records?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Note: [Whereupon, at this time, Principal Court Reporter Susan Pearce-Bates relieved Senior Court Reporter Lisa Kramsky as the official court reporter.]

Christopher Conroy: Could you briefly explain why that is?

Daniel Dixon: So, these reports are used for network and billing purposes. They show the raw records, how that call flows through the network.

Christopher Conroy: So, if it had more than one entry, would that just mean it hit different parts of the network while the call was going on?

Daniel Dixon: Correct.

Christopher Conroy: I have no further questions.

Juan Merchan: Your witness.

Emil Bove: Thank you, Judge.

Juan Merchan: You may inquire.

Emil Bove: Thank you.

Note: [Cross-examination by Emil Bove.]

Emil Bove: Good morning, Mr. Dixon. My names is Emil Bove and I represent President Trump, who is over here to the left. I just want to talk in a little bit more detail about some of the records we just covered to make sure I understand them.

Daniel Dixon: Okay.

Emil Bove: I would like to start with the subscriber record.

Emil Bove: And, Mr. Bernik, if we can bring up the same page that the Government had up from Government's Exhibit 400 with Bates ending 038. Can we ask the Government to bring up that page? If you can zoom in, please, on the box that has the MSISDN. Thank you.

Emil Bove: So, Mr. Dixon, in the top left, that is MSISDN, which is the phone number you said?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Emil Bove: To the right of that cell it says, IMSI. Do you see that?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Emil Bove: And that stands for International Mobile Subscriber Identity, right?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Emil Bove: And the IMSI is linked to an AT&T's user account, right?

Daniel Dixon: Well, it's the serial number of a SIM card.

Emil Bove: Right. So, it is a SIM card that is linked to the AT&T account that we are looking at?

Daniel Dixon: At that time, yes.

Emil Bove: And a SIM card can be pulled out of one phone, one device, and put into another, correct?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Emil Bove: And so, this IMSI is not necessarily linked to a particular physical device, right?

Daniel Dixon: Correct. It can be taken out. It's just the serial number of a SIM card.

Emil Bove: If we can zoom in on status changes there at the bottom, please.

Emil Bove: Mr. Dixon, I wanted to ask about the cells that read XMKT Move. Do you see that?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Emil Bove: And that means that that is a cross market move, right?

Daniel Dixon: I believe so.

Emil Bove: That is a situation where the user's account transitions from one account number to another within AT&T's records, right?

Daniel Dixon: Usually, yes.

Emil Bove: So, here this record indicates that on January 23, 2017, this was a cross market move associated with this Michael Cohen account?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Emil Bove: And so, for the record that we are looking at, this user account, the subscriber information begins January 23, 2017?

Daniel Dixon: Can you repeat that?

Emil Bove: Because of the cross market move field that we are looking at, what that suggests is that the subscriber information we are looking at begins on that period?

Daniel Dixon: We would have to look in the other boxes because this is -- the status change history only shows changes of the account. So, it could have been created before and something took place on January 23, 2017.

Emil Bove: Right. The account could have been created before and then the phone number transitioned onto this account by a cross market move?

Daniel Dixon: Possibly.

Emil Bove: Do you want to look at a different piece of this page to try to figure that out?

Daniel Dixon: Could you zoom back out? So, it was -- it would seem as if on January 23rd, the number left this account.

Emil Bove: And if we can zoom back in on that box, please. Thank you.

Emil Bove: Do you see that the top two rows, contract accepted and contract acceptance required?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Emil Bove: What does that indicate?

Daniel Dixon: I am not familiar with it.

Emil Bove: Now, we can take that down. Thank you.

Emil Bove: I want to talk a little bit about the AT&T billing records. And those are, basically, records of calls involving this phone number over AT&T's network, right?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Emil Bove: And you can't tell from the records themselves who actually spoke, right?

Daniel Dixon: Correct.

Emil Bove: And, obviously, these records don't reflect the contents of the calls, right?

Daniel Dixon: Correct.

Emil Bove: And you are familiar with the concept of a pocket dial, right?

Daniel Dixon: Correct.

Emil Bove: So, it's possible that that could happen, somebody picks up the phone, the phone gets picked up on the other end but there is no communication, right?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Emil Bove: In these records, there is a lot of data here, but the data also has limits, right?

Daniel Dixon: It's showing the transactional logs.

Emil Bove: Transactional logs meaning the amount of time that the one phone number was connected to the other, right?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Emil Bove: And also that period of time where the one phone number was dialing the other?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Emil Bove: And if we can bring up the redacted mobility logs that we were looking at. Thank you.

Emil Bove: You see on the right side there is a column, IMEI on there?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Emil Bove: That's International Mobile Equipment Identity, right?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Emil Bove: And that is, actually, a number that is linked to a physical device, right?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Emil Bove: So that IMSI, travels with a SIM card you pulled out from another phone, right?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Emil Bove: But on this record, where is says IMEI on it, that is a specific reference to a particular phone, correct?

Daniel Dixon: A device, yes.

Emil Bove: There is one unredacted page that I would like to show just the witness, Judge, if that is all right.

Juan Merchan: Sure.

Emil Bove: So, Mr. Bernik, this is for the parties, the Court and the witness, part of Government Exhibit 400 that ends with Bates 1093, please.

Emil Bove: And I just want to make sure that I understand the Feature column, and so, we are going to go through a couple of these, and I am going over to the table so I can see as well.

Emil Bove: And so, let's -- if we could zoom in on the Feature column for item seven and eight on this page.

Emil Bove: And, Mr. Dixon, while we are doing that, are you familiar with the codes in the Feature column?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Emil Bove: And so, do you see where it says, NIOP?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Emil Bove: And that's Call Number Identity Presentation, right?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Emil Bove: Basically an incoming call?

Daniel Dixon: Correct.

Emil Bove: And then do you see where it says, CFNA?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Emil Bove: Calling Number Identity Presentation, right?

Daniel Dixon: No. CFNA is Call Forwarding No Answer.

Emil Bove: And then the next one is VM, Voice-mail?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Emil Bove: So, am I understanding this right, that when I see something like this in the Feature column, what I am looking at is a call that is dialed and then it goes to voicemail, right?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Emil Bove: And in the AT&T records, each account has a separate phone number for voicemail, right?

Daniel Dixon: Not each account, but each voicemail magistrate. So, there is another number entailed with voicemail.

Emil Bove: Was it voicemail magistrate that you said?

Daniel Dixon: Voicemail box.

Emil Bove: And so, that an incoming call to the number associated with this account, again, gets forwarded to that voice-mail inbox, right?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Emil Bove: Now, if we can stay on these two rows, items seven and eight, and if you can zoom in on Originating Number and Terminating Number.

Emil Bove: And so, you see here there is a D in parentheses?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Emil Bove: That stands for dialed, right?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Emil Bove: And so, there is an originating number that dialed that 0114 number, right?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Emil Bove: And then where you see the F in parentheses --

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Emil Bove: -- that is the number getting forwarded to the voicemail inbox, correct?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Emil Bove: And that's what the F means?

Daniel Dixon: Yes.

Emil Bove: I have nothing further, Judge.

Juan Merchan: Any redirect?

Christopher Conroy: I have nothing, Judge. Thank you.

Juan Merchan: Thank you, sir. You can step down.

Juan Merchan: Would you like to call your next witness?

Christopher Conroy: Yes, Judge. At this time the People call Jennie Tomalin.

Court Officer: Witness entering.

Emil Bove: And are you here because Verizon received a subpoena asking for custodian testimony?

Jennie Tomalin: Yes, I am.

Emil Bove: Relating, specifically, to its phone business, does Verizon keep subscriber and call records?

Jennie Tomalin: Yes, we do.

Emil Bove: Generally, what are call records?

Jennie Tomalin: Call records for the wireless side are billable incoming and outgoing calls. On the wired-line side, call records will be tolls or billable outbound calls.

Emil Bove: And what are subscriber records?

Jennie Tomalin: Records that contain the financial responsible party for the line of service or account, including any contact information, address, et cetera.

Emil Bove: Does Verizon make and keep subscriber and call records in the regular course of its business?

Jennie Tomalin: Yes, we do.

Emil Bove: And is it the regular course of Verizon's business to make and keep such records?

Jennie Tomalin: Yes, it is.

Christopher Conroy: I am going to ask that the witness be handed a thumb drive. Thank you.

Emil Bove: Ms. Tomalin, if you take a look at that thumb drive, does that thumb drive contain a set of Verizon records that have been marked for identification as People's Exhibit 401?

Jennie Tomalin: Yes, it does.

Emil Bove: And before coming to court today, did you have a chance to review the records on that thumb drive?

Jennie Tomalin: I did.

Emil Bove: And is that the thumb drive you reviewed?

Jennie Tomalin: Yes, it is.

Emil Bove: How do you know that?

Jennie Tomalin: Because I initialed and dated the thumb drive.

Emil Bove: Are the records contained in People's 401 for identification on that thumb drive call and subscriber records?

Jennie Tomalin: Yes, they are.

Emil Bove: How many different phone numbers do they relate to?

Jennie Tomalin: Twelve.

Emil Bove: Do those phone numbers all belong to Verizon customers?

Jennie Tomalin: Yes.

Emil Bove: Do all of the phone records, both subscriber and call records, relate to the general time period of 2015 to 2018?

Jennie Tomalin: Yes.

Emil Bove: Did Verizon make and keep the subscriber and call records contained in People's Exhibit 401 for identification in the regular course of its business?

Jennie Tomalin: Yes.

Emil Bove: Was it the regular course of Verizon's business to make and keep these particular records?

Jennie Tomalin: Yes.

Emil Bove: Are the entries made on these documents made at the time of the recorded events or transactions took place or written a reasonable time thereafter?

Jennie Tomalin: Yes.

Emil Bove: Is the date contained in these reports captured -- I am sorry. Is the data contained in these reports captured through an automated process and stored in the electronic database?

Jennie Tomalin: Yes.

Emil Bove: Does Verizon rely on the accuracy of that automated process and electronic database?

Jennie Tomalin: Yes.

Emil Bove: Can Verizon employees run reports that capture data from the electronic database?

Jennie Tomalin: Yes.

Emil Bove: Are they under a business duty to do so accurately?

Jennie Tomalin: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: At this point I am going to offer People's Exhibit 401 into evidence.

Emil Bove: No objection.

Juan Merchan: It's accepted into evidence.

Note: [Whereupon, People's Exhibit 401 is received into evidence.]

Christopher Conroy: If we can now pull up -- I think I am running a little behind here. If we can pull up a redacted page from one of the call records.

Emil Bove: Displayed in front of you and for the room is a redacted page from People's 401 which bears the Bates stamp DANY GJ, triple 0, 64777. Is this a representative sample of a call record for a Verizon phone number?

Jennie Tomalin: Yes, it is.

Emil Bove: Does this page that we are looking at contain redactions?

Jennie Tomalin: Yes, it does.

Emil Bove: Did you have a chance to compare this redacted page to the original page that is part of what's in evidence as People's 401?

Jennie Tomalin: Yes, I did.

Emil Bove: But for the redactions, are the pages identical?

Jennie Tomalin: Yes.

Emil Bove: Could you just walk us through the columns on this page and explain what each one is?

Jennie Tomalin: Yes. Starting on the left, the Date column identifies the date that the call began. The Time column identifies the time the call began. The Number column will identify the telephone number that the target telephone number was communicating with. The Rate and Usage Type columns identify what portion of a customer's calling plan will be applied to these calls.

Jennie Tomalin: The Origination column identifies the geographical area for which we are billing the target telephone number while making or receiving the telephone call. The Destination Call Logs for FM calls, identified by the home area of the telephone number being called. For Incoming Calls it will reflect incoming CL or any other code that is needed with that call.

Jennie Tomalin: The Min column, identifies the length of the call in minutes. Air Time Charges, Long Distance/Other Charges and Total, those three columns identify any financial charges assessed to that call respectively.

Emil Bove: Just a couple of quick questions. In the MIN column, is that minutes?

Jennie Tomalin: Yes, it is.

Emil Bove: And how does that work? Does it reflect seconds, or does Verizon round in a standard direction?

Jennie Tomalin: On the bill we round up.

Emil Bove: And with respect to the time shown for each of those calls, what timezone does Verizon keep its records in?

Jennie Tomalin: They -- the timezone should be the timezone for the City and State reflected in the origination column.

Emil Bove: So, when we look at the date and time columns, together with the origination column, that should tell us the timezone that that call is being reflected in?

Jennie Tomalin: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: Thank you. I have no further questions.

Juan Merchan: You may inquire.

Emil Bove: Thank you, Judge.

Note: [Cross-examination by Emil Bove.]

Emil Bove: Good morning, Ms. Tomalin.

Jennie Tomalin: Good morning.

Emil Bove: My name is Emil Bove and I represent President Trump, who is over here on my left. I want to talk a little lit about the subscriber records that are part of Exhibit 401 if we could.

Jennie Tomalin: Yes.

Emil Bove: Because they are not redacted, I am just going to ask --

Juan Merchan: Sure.

Emil Bove: So, Mr. Bernik, this is just for the Court, the parties and the witness.

Emil Bove: Take a look at the spreadsheet with Bates ending 64591. And Ms. Tomalin, do you see that in Column D it says, MTN?

Jennie Tomalin: Yes.

Emil Bove: That's Mobile Telephone Number in Verizon records, right?

Jennie Tomalin: Yes.

Emil Bove: The phone number linked to the account, correct?

Jennie Tomalin: Yes.

Emil Bove: And so, if you look at cell D3, Column D, row three, that row relates to telephone number ending 5361?

Jennie Tomalin: Yes.

Emil Bove: And if you look, staying on that row, at Columns F and G, the subscriber name is Keith Davidson linked to this number?

Jennie Tomalin: Yes.

Emil Bove: So that when you say, subscriber name, that's information that somebody provided to Verizon saying that I am a person who is linked to this account, right?

Jennie Tomalin: Yes.

Emil Bove: And Mr. Bernik, if we could scroll over to Column AA, please.

Emil Bove: Do you see where it says, MTN Effective Date?

Jennie Tomalin: Yes.

Emil Bove: So, that's a Mobile Telephone Number Effective Date, right?

Jennie Tomalin: Correct.

Emil Bove: That indicates the date on which this phone number was linked to the account, right?

Jennie Tomalin: That's right.

Emil Bove: So, for this row, what does it say for this row? I am sorry. I can't see.

Jennie Tomalin: That was row three, correct?

Emil Bove: Yes. Thank you.

Jennie Tomalin: April 30, 2010.

Emil Bove: So, for this record, as of April 30, 2010, going forward, this number was linked to the particular account that's reflected in this subscriber information, right?

Jennie Tomalin: Correct.

Emil Bove: And for purposes of this record, prior to April of 2010, this record doesn't have anything to say about that, correct?

Jennie Tomalin: Correct.

Emil Bove: And phone numbers can shift from account to account and person to person, right?

Jennie Tomalin: Yes.

Emil Bove: And so, you know, it's entirely possible that pre-April 2010, this number belonged to somebody else, right?

Jennie Tomalin: Yes.

Emil Bove: I just -- I have one question about the toll records that we looked at in Government Exhibit 401. Those sorts of looked like the phone bills that I might get for my cellphone, right?

Jennie Tomalin: Yes.

Emil Bove: And you said Verizon rounds up on the Duration field?

Jennie Tomalin: Yes.

Emil Bove: So, if there was a call that lasted 15 seconds, does that bump up to one minute?

Jennie Tomalin: Yes.

Emil Bove: And if a call lasted one second, it bumps up to one minute also?

Jennie Tomalin: Yes.

Emil Bove: Thank you.

Juan Merchan: Anything else?

Christopher Conroy: No, Judge.

Juan Merchan: Thank you. You may step down.

Jennie Tomalin: Thank you.

Note: [Whereupon, the witness is excused.]

Juan Merchan: All right, jurors. Let's take our morning recess. Please remember my admonitions. See you in a few minutes.

Court Officer: All rise.

Juan Merchan: You may be seated. People, is there anything you want to discuss at this time?

Joshua Steinglass: No. We have to modify the exhibit as we discussed before.

Juan Merchan: I believe there was also an objection from the Defense.

Emil Bove: Yes, Judge.

Juan Merchan: Is this a good time to take up the objection?

Emil Bove: Yes, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: Let's do that.

Emil Bove: So, Government Exhibit 411, it would be 411-B is the proffered exhibit, is an excerpt of -- an excerpt of an -- excuse me, excerpt of an interview of President Trump by Larry King in 1999. And, in substance, there is a question, what are your views on campaign finance reform? And part of what President Trump said in response to that in 1999 is that he is very experienced with the campaign finance laws, and I think the clip is limited to just about that.

Emil Bove: Our position is that that is not relevant with respect to President Trump's state of mind in 2016 and 2017 because there has been extensive revisions to the campaign finance laws in the intervening period, both statutory and in the Supreme Court. Whatever President Trump may have said in 1999 about his knowledge of the campaign finance laws is not probative of his state of mind in 2016 and 2017.

Rebecca Mangold: Your Honor, we disagree. We think that Defendant's admission that he has extensive knowledge of campaign finance laws is obviously directly relevant to the case. We understand that there were, as Mr. Bove noted, extensive changes to campaign finance laws in 2002. We believe that's a reference to the McCain/Feingold Act.

Rebecca Mangold: However, the separate contribution ban, which is the one that's relevant here, has been part of campaign finance laws since 1907, so close to 90 years before Mr. Trump made the admission in that video. And to the extent that defense counsel argues that the clip predates the relevant time period, that's an issue that goes to weight and not admissibility.

Juan Merchan: Do you have any other argument?

Emil Bove: No. That's our position, Judge.

Juan Merchan: All right. I will rule after the break.

Sergeant: Remain seated. Come to Order. Part 59 is back in session.

Juan Merchan: All right. Two things regarding the People's application, I understand what you are saying, that the laws did not change between 1999 and 2017. I still feel that that's pretty attenuated. Plus, you are asking the jurors to draw an inference that because he knew the laws in 1999, he still knew them in 2015 and 2017. I think that's a lot of speculation.

Juan Merchan: I am going to side with the Defense and preclude you from introducing that. Regarding scheduling today, we have two more witnesses, right, today?

Joshua Steinglass: Yes.

Juan Merchan: And how long do you expect the witnesses to be?

Rebecca Mangold: I think we probably have an hour in total.

Juan Merchan: In total?

Rebecca Mangold: In total.

Juan Merchan: So, are we okay working until one o'clock, or maybe a little bit longer than one o'clock, so we will end in the morning and not come back in the afternoon?

Todd Blanche: Yes, your Honor.

Rebecca Mangold: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: Your Honor, I have a legal matter about an exhibit that we can take up after the witnesses are done. I don't think it will take long.

Juan Merchan: Let's get the jury, please.

Sergeant: All rise, jury entering.

Juan Merchan: You may be seated.

Court Clerk: Case on trial continued. All jurors are present and properly seated.

Juan Merchan: Jurors, before we call the next witness, I wanted to talk about the schedule for the rest of the day. I am told that we only have two more witnesses that are relatively short. Today's plan is we are going to work until about one o'clock or whatever time we get done so you don't have to come back in the afternoon.

Juan Merchan: Let's call the next witness, please.

Rebecca Mangold: The People recall Georgia Longstreet.

Juan Merchan: Ms. Longstreet, you are still under oath. You may inquire.

Rebecca Mangold: Thank you, your Honor.

Note: [G-E-O-R-G-I-A L-O-N-G-S-T-R-E-E-T, called as a witness, being previously sworn, was examined and testified further as follows.]

Rebecca Mangold: Welcome back, Ms. Longstreet. Can you remind everyone where you work and what your position is?

Georgia Longstreet: Yes. I work for the New York County District Attorney's Office, and I am a paralegal.

Rebecca Mangold: The last time you were here, I believe you testified that your duties and responsibilities include locating and saving social media posts relevant to the case?

Georgia Longstreet: Yep.

Rebecca Mangold: Is that your primary job function, or do you have many other duties and responsibilities in addition to that one?

Georgia Longstreet: Many other duties and responsibilities.

Rebecca Mangold: Do your other duties and responsibilities include analyzing materials produced to the District Attorney's Office in response to subpoenas?

Georgia Longstreet: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Does that include analyzing records of communications like text messages and call messages?

Georgia Longstreet: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Does that include analyzing contact information?

Georgia Longstreet: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Does it include matching contact information to text and call records?

Georgia Longstreet: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Do your duties and responsibilities also include locating and reviewing filings from other court proceedings that may be relevant to this case?

Georgia Longstreet: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: And do they also include keeping track of key events related to the case?

Georgia Longstreet: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Now, you previously testified that you were assigned to work on a matter involving Donald Trump about a year and a half ago, right?

Georgia Longstreet: Yep.

Rebecca Mangold: Are you the only paralegal who works on this matter?

Georgia Longstreet: I am not.

Rebecca Mangold: Who else works on the matter with you in the paralegal capacity?

Georgia Longstreet: There are two other paralegals, Nishant Bhaumik and Jaden Jarmel-Schneider.

Rebecca Mangold: In addition to your own work, are you familiar with the work done by the other paralegals on the case?

Georgia Longstreet: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: How are you familiar with that?

Georgia Longstreet: I like to think we all work as one. We all kind of do the same things.

Rebecca Mangold: And do you know what work they do in addition to your own?

Georgia Longstreet: Yep.

Rebecca Mangold: As part of your role on the matter involving Donald Trump, are you, Mr. Bhaumik and Mr. Jarmel-Schneider responsible for reviewing materials produced to the DA's Office in response to subpoenas?

Georgia Longstreet: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: And does that include analyzing records of communications like text messages and phone calls?

Georgia Longstreet: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Does that include analyzing contact information that is relevant to this case?

Georgia Longstreet: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: And does that include matching contact information to text and call records for this case?

Georgia Longstreet: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Are the records provided to the District Attorney's Office for this case in multiple different formats?

Georgia Longstreet: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Are you, Mr. Bhaumik and Mr. Jarmel-Schneider required to analyze and work with the data in all of those different formats?

Georgia Longstreet: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: And is the data provided in different timezones?

Georgia Longstreet: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: And are you, as part of your job, required to convert timezones in order to analyze the data?

Georgia Longstreet: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: In total, approximately, how many pages of text messages have you, Mr. Bhaumik and Mr. Jarmel-Schneider reviewed in connection with the case?

Georgia Longstreet: Pages, I would say, maybe like 2500.

Rebecca Mangold: How many have you personally reviewed?

Georgia Longstreet: Probably around a hundred.

Rebecca Mangold: Approximately, how many pages of call records have you, Mr. Bhaumik and Mr. Jarmel-Schneider reviewed in connection with the case?

Georgia Longstreet: Over 10,000 pages.

Rebecca Mangold: And how many have you personally reviewed?

Georgia Longstreet: Probably around two to 3,000.

Rebecca Mangold: Approximately, how much contact information have you and the other paralegals reviewed in connection with the case?

Georgia Longstreet: Probably around 300 to 500 pages.

Rebecca Mangold: And how many have you personally reviewed?

Georgia Longstreet: One hundred to 200.

Rebecca Mangold: Approximately, how many contacts have you and the other paralegals have had to match with text and phone records?

Georgia Longstreet: About 50.

Rebecca Mangold: Did you and Mr. Bhaumik and Mr. Jarmel-Schneider also review and save public court filings that could be relevant to the case?

Georgia Longstreet: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Approximately, how many legal proceedings did you and the other paralegals review and save items from?

Georgia Longstreet: Approximately, 75 different cases.

Rebecca Mangold: Approximately, how many individual court filings, total, did you and the paralegal team review and save?

Georgia Longstreet: About 500.

Rebecca Mangold: Through your work on the case, are you familiar with an important -- I am sorry -- dates of important court filings?

Georgia Longstreet: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Before testifying today, did you have an opportunity to review files marked for identification as People's Exhibits 407-F, 407-G, 407-H and 407-I?

Georgia Longstreet: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Are they public posts from the Twitter handle @realDonaldTrump.

Georgia Longstreet: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Who retrieved and saved those posts?

Georgia Longstreet: I did.

Rebecca Mangold: Did you save them in a particular way?

Georgia Longstreet: I did.

Rebecca Mangold: And did you save them in the same way that you saved the previous Twitter posts that we discussed last time?

Georgia Longstreet: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Can you briefly remind the jury what that was?

Georgia Longstreet: Yes. So, I just used the platform or the tool that we have to screenshot, and I then screenshot the post, save it to a folder that was relevant to the post and then hashed the post.

Rebecca Mangold: And hashing, again, is a way to uniquely identify each post?

Georgia Longstreet: Yeah.

Rebecca Mangold: Are these exhibits exact copies of the public posts that you saved and hashed?

Georgia Longstreet: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: The People now offer into evidence Exhibits 407-F, G, H and I.

Todd Blanche: Your Honor, the same objection as discussed last week.

Juan Merchan: Your objection is noted and overruled. People's Exhibits 407-F, G, H and I are accepted into evidence.

Note: [Whereupon, People's Exhibits 407-F, G, H and I were received into evidence.]

Rebecca Mangold: All right. Can you please display what's now in evidence as People's Exhibit 407-F?

Note: [Direct examination by Rebecca Mangold.]

Rebecca Mangold: Ms. Longstreet, is this a Twitter post?

Georgia Longstreet: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: And I think last time you explained some aspects of the social media platform Twitter and how it operated in 2016?

Georgia Longstreet: Yep.

Rebecca Mangold: In addition to those questions, can you explain what a thread is?

Georgia Longstreet: Yes. So, Twitter has a character limit which only allows you to put a certain amount of characters for one tweet. So, a way that some users are able to get around the character limit is by posting multiple tweets in the same thread so they are kind of connected to each other in a sense.

Rebecca Mangold: And is this an example of a thread?

Georgia Longstreet: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Is the first post -- I am sorry -- is the top post shown here the first one in time?

Georgia Longstreet: Yep.

Rebecca Mangold: Were all of these posts made the same day?

Georgia Longstreet: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: What Twitter handle was used to make these posts?

Georgia Longstreet: @realDonaldTrump.

Rebecca Mangold: What's the date and time shown for the top post?

Georgia Longstreet: April 21st, 2018 at 9:10 am.

Rebecca Mangold: Can you please focus on just the top post? Can you read the top post to the jury?

Georgia Longstreet: Yes. The New York Times and a third-rate reporter named Maggie Haberman, known as a Crooked H flunkie, who I don't speak to and have nothing to do with, are going out of their way to destroy Michael Cohen and his relationship with me in the hope that he will flip. They use -- dot, dot, dot.

Rebecca Mangold: Can you pull up the bottom two posts, please?

Rebecca Mangold: Can you read those?

Georgia Longstreet: Non-existent sources and a drunk slash drugged up loser who hates Michael, a fine person with a wonderful family, Michael is a businessman for his own account slash lawyer who I always liked and respected. Most people will flip if the Government lets them out of trouble, even if it means lying or making up stories.

Georgia Longstreet: Sorry, I don't see Michael doing that despite the horrible Witch Hunt and the dishonest media.

Rebecca Mangold: What's the date for all three of the posts?

Georgia Longstreet: April 21, 2018.

Rebecca Mangold: You can take that down.

Rebecca Mangold: Did the court filings that you reviewed include a Federal criminal case for Michael Cohen?

Georgia Longstreet: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Was one of the court filings the paralegal team saved for that case a guilty plea?

Georgia Longstreet: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Do you know the date of that guilty plea?

Georgia Longstreet: I believe it was August 21, 2018.

Rebecca Mangold: Now, can we please display what is in evidence as People's Exhibit 407-H?

Rebecca Mangold: Can you see that, Ms. Longstreet?

Georgia Longstreet: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Is this another Twitter post?

Georgia Longstreet: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: What Twitter handle was used to make this post?

Georgia Longstreet: @realDonaldTrump.

Rebecca Mangold: And what is the date and time for this post?

Georgia Longstreet: It ends August 22, 2018 at 8:44 a.m.?

Rebecca Mangold: Can you please read this to the jury?

Georgia Longstreet: If anyone is looking for a good lawyer, I would strongly suggest that you don't retain the services of Michael Cohen.

Rebecca Mangold: And is there an explanation point end of that post?

Georgia Longstreet: Yes. Sorry.

Rebecca Mangold: And can we take this down and display what's in evidence as People's Exhibit 407-I.

Rebecca Mangold: Is this another Twitter post that you pulled and saved?

Georgia Longstreet: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: What is the Twitter handle used to make this post?

Georgia Longstreet: @realDonaldTrump.

Rebecca Mangold: What is the date and time shown for this post?

Georgia Longstreet: August 22, 2018, at 9:21 a.m.

Rebecca Mangold: And is that the same day as the last post we just saw?

Georgia Longstreet: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: How long after the post we just saw was this one posted?

Georgia Longstreet: I would have to see the timestamp.

Rebecca Mangold: It's fine. But it was posted the same day?

Georgia Longstreet: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Can you read this post to the jury?

Georgia Longstreet: Yes. I feel very badly for Paul Manafort and his wonderful family. Justice took a 12-year-old tax case, among other things, applied tremendous pressure on him and unlike Michael Cohen he refused to break, make up stories in order to get a deal. Such respect for a great man. Explanation point.

Rebecca Mangold: All right. We can take that down. Now, finally, can we display what's in evidence as People's Exhibit 407-G, please? Can you flip through the pages of this Exhibit quickly?

Rebecca Mangold: Ms. Longstreet, is this another Twitter post that you saved?

Georgia Longstreet: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Is this another example of a thread?

Georgia Longstreet: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: And how many parts does this thread have?

Georgia Longstreet: Three.

Rebecca Mangold: What was the Twitter handle used to make these posts?

Georgia Longstreet: @realDonaldTrump.

Rebecca Mangold: And what is the date and time shown for the top post?

Georgia Longstreet: May 3rd, 2018 at 6:46 a.m.

Rebecca Mangold: And can you please read the post for the jury?

Georgia Longstreet: Mr. Cohen, an attorney, received a monthly retainer, not from the campaign and having nothing to do with the campaign, from which he entered into through reimbursement a private contract between two parties, known as a Non-Disclosure Agreement or NDA. These agreements are -- dot, dot, dot.

Rebecca Mangold: Then move to the second post to the thread.

Georgia Longstreet: Very common amongst celebrities and people of wealth. In this case it is in full force and effect and will be used in arbitration for damages against Ms. Clifford, Daniels. The agreement was used to stop the false and extortionist accusations made by her about an affair --

Rebecca Mangold: And is this now the final post in the thread?

Georgia Longstreet: Yes. Despite already having signed a detailed letter admitting that there was no affair, prior to its violation by Ms. Clifford and her attorney, this was a private agreement. Money for the campaign or campaign contributions played no role in this transaction.

Rebecca Mangold: Thank you. Can we take that down, please? Now, can we show everyone what's already in evidence as People's Exhibit, 171 A?

Rebecca Mangold: Ms. Longstreet, do you recognize this?

Georgia Longstreet: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: And how do you recognize it?

Georgia Longstreet: This was something that the paralegal team had to analyze in response to subpoena compliance.

Rebecca Mangold: So this was produced -- this is a document that was produced to the DA's Office pursuant to a subpoena?

Georgia Longstreet: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: And you and the paralegal team analyzed the document after it was received?

Georgia Longstreet: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Do you --

Rebecca Mangold: Can you please blow up the two middle columns?

Rebecca Mangold: And do you see contact information in those middle columns?

Georgia Longstreet: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Based on your work on the case, can you identify the individuals associated with the contact information provided there?

Georgia Longstreet: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: So, looking first on the left, there is something redacted, and then it says, @dylanhoward.com. Is that an email address?

Georgia Longstreet: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Do you know who that email address is associated with?

Georgia Longstreet: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Who is it?

Georgia Longstreet: Dylan Howard.

Rebecca Mangold: And do you see just below that there is an email address that ends, @wideeyecommunications.com?

Georgia Longstreet: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Based upon on your work on the case, can you identify the individual associated with that email address?

Georgia Longstreet: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Who is it?

Georgia Longstreet: Dylan Howard.

Rebecca Mangold: Looking now to the other column, do you see where it just has the letter G?

Georgia Longstreet: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: And there are the last four digits of the phone number shown there?

Georgia Longstreet: Yeah.

Rebecca Mangold: Based on your work on the case, can you identify the individual associated with that phone number?

Georgia Longstreet: Yeah.

Rebecca Mangold: Who is it?

Georgia Longstreet: Gina Rodriguez.

Note: [Whereupon, Principal Court Reporter, Susan Pearce-Bates was relieved by Senior Court Reporter Theresa Magniccari.]

Note: [Whereupon, the proceedings were continued from the following page.]

Note: [Continued direct examination by Rebecca Mangold.]

Rebecca Mangold: Now, if we take a look at the second page of the PDF. The same two columns.

Rebecca Mangold: Can we show both the blue and green portions near the top.

Note: [Displayed]

Rebecca Mangold: So, which column -- here is the "to" column, and which is the "from" column?

Georgia Longstreet: The "to" column is on the left and the "from" column is on the right.

Rebecca Mangold: Is that typical or is it more standard to have those columns switched?

Georgia Longstreet: It's more standard to have them switched.

Rebecca Mangold: Now, can we look at the text -- a few of the text messages on the right, please.

Rebecca Mangold: Ms. Longstreet, based on your analysis of the various calls and text messages, can you tell what time zone this is in?

Georgia Longstreet: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: What time zone is that?

Georgia Longstreet: UTC.

Rebecca Mangold: What is UTC time?

Georgia Longstreet: UTC time is a standardized time zone for everybody. So I don't remember exactly what UTC stands for. It's three hours ahead based -- depending on when Daylight Savings is.

Rebecca Mangold: Does it correspond with time zones in London?

Georgia Longstreet: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: So the New York time zone for these might depend on whether it was Daylight Savings Time or not?

Georgia Longstreet: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: If we can zoom back out.

Rebecca Mangold: Do you see there are portions of this exhibit that have been redacted?

Georgia Longstreet: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Who redacted this?

Georgia Longstreet: I did.

Rebecca Mangold: All right. Now, turning back to the first page of the document. Focusing on the first five text messages on the right and showing the "to" and "from" column. Were all of these text messages sent on the same date?

Georgia Longstreet: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: What date is that?

Georgia Longstreet: April 7, 2016.

Juan Merchan: Your witness.

Note: [Cross examination by Todd Blanche.]

Todd Blanche: Good morning again, Ms. Longstreet. How are you?

Georgia Longstreet: Good. How are you?

Todd Blanche: We spoke last Friday, correct?

Georgia Longstreet: We did.

Todd Blanche: So I am not going to re-ask all the questions that I asked last Friday about the work that you did. The first was talking about the tweets and the Truth's that you reviewed. I believe you testified last week, but correct me if I am wrong, that you reviewed thousands of tweets and Truths as part of your work on this case?

Georgia Longstreet: I did.

Todd Blanche: And the tweets that we saw today, again, you didn't select which ones to put up out of the thousands that you reviewed, for example, the table here and to my right selected them, right?

Georgia Longstreet: That's correct.

Todd Blanche: And since you testified last Friday, have you been tasked with doing any additional social media reviews of anybody involved in this case?

Georgia Longstreet: Like additional review that wasn't already being done before?

Todd Blanche: Yes.

Georgia Longstreet: No.

Todd Blanche: So you're still not reviewing Mr. Cohen's TikTok?

Georgia Longstreet: Not currently, no.

Todd Blanche: You're not aware of something that he TikTok'd two nights ago, for example, on Wednesday night?

Rebecca Mangold: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Overruled.

Georgia Longstreet: I am not.

Todd Blanche: Turning to the number of text messages that you just read back and forth, you've been in court every day during this trial, correct?

Georgia Longstreet: Correct.

Todd Blanche: And you were here when Mr. Pecker testified?

Georgia Longstreet: Yes.

Todd Blanche: And you're aware that he was shown a number of text messages that he was a participant in, correct?

Georgia Longstreet: Yes.

Todd Blanche: And when he was shown text messages that he was a participant in, you recall questions being asked of him about what he meant by that or what his understanding was of what somebody else sent to him?

Georgia Longstreet: Yes.

Todd Blanche: And you agree that the text messages that you just read, you have no personal knowledge about the reason they were sent or even whether they were accurate when they were sent by either of the folks, Ms. Rodriguez or Mr. Howard, do you?

Georgia Longstreet: No personal knowledge, no.

Todd Blanche: When, for example, Ms. Rodriguez talks about offers from the Daily Mail and the timing of those offers, you have no knowledge about whether she was telling the truth, do you?

Georgia Longstreet: No.

Todd Blanche: And you have no knowledge about any of the -- no knowledge about the truthfulness or the reasoning behind the text that Mr. Howard sent in response, or because of whatever Ms. Rodriguez said, correct?

Georgia Longstreet: Can you ask that again.

Todd Blanche: Sure. You have no personal knowledge about either the communications that Mr. Howard initiated or that he responded to in the series of text messages that you were -- that you just read to the jury, correct?

Georgia Longstreet: Correct.

Todd Blanche: It's a long way of saying, you just read what was written on the exhibit, correct?

Georgia Longstreet: Yes.

Todd Blanche: And that's different, would you agree, than when Mr. Pecker was asked about the reasoning behind text messages and what he meant by that, correct?

Georgia Longstreet: Yes.

Todd Blanche: And same with Ms. Hicks?

Georgia Longstreet: Yes.

Todd Blanche: Excuse me, your Honor.

Todd Blanche: Now, by the way, the same with the text messages of Mr. Cohen, correct, meaning, you didn't read any today, but you have reviewed as part of your work on this case text messages sent and received from Mr. Cohen as well, correct?

Georgia Longstreet: Yes.

Todd Blanche: Now, going back briefly to the social media that you reviewed, were you also tasked with reviewing Ms. Daniels' social media over the last couple of years?

Georgia Longstreet: Yes.

Todd Blanche: And are you continuing to review it during this trial?

Georgia Longstreet: Yes.

Todd Blanche: Did you review it, for example, this week or last night?

Georgia Longstreet: Not last night, but I think earlier in the week at some point, yeah.

Todd Blanche: And as part of that review, not limiting it to Ms. Daniels, but to all the parties that your reviewing, when you observe something that you believe to be interesting, what's the process that you use to alert that to your team?

Georgia Longstreet: Well, I think it depends. I think there are some things that I just know for a fact we would want to have saved to our case file. There are other things I have a question about, I will call one of the attorneys and ask them if they think I should pull it or not.

Todd Blanche: Basically, not to -- but based upon the information you provide them, the Prosecutors that you work with decide whether to use it or not use it, correct?

Georgia Longstreet: Basically, yeah.

Todd Blanche: No further questions, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: Anything else?

Rebecca Mangold: No, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: Your next witness.

Christopher Conroy: Judge, the People call Jaden Jarmel-Schneider.

Court Clerk: Do you solemnly swear or affirm that the testimony that you are going to give before this Court and jury shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, do you so swear or affirm?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: I do.

Court Clerk: Have a seat.

Court Officer: State your full name for the record, spelling your last name.

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Jaden Jarmel-Schneider, J-A-R-M-E-L, S-C-H-N-E-I-D-E-R.

Court Officer: County of residence?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: New York County.

Juan Merchan: Good afternoon. You may inquire.

Christopher Conroy: Thank you.

Note: [Direct examination by Christopher Conroy.]

Christopher Conroy: Good afternoon, Mr. Schneider. Where do you work?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: I work at the New York County District Attorney's Office.

Christopher Conroy: How long have you worked there?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Coming up on two years.

Christopher Conroy: And what is your current position there?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: I am a paralegal.

Christopher Conroy: What are some of the things that you do as a paralegal at the DA's office?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: It really runs the gamut. But, in general, we help the attorneys: Sending out subpoenas and kind of organizing and analyzing whatever records we receive in response.

Christopher Conroy: In your work as a paralegal at the District Attorney's office, were you assigned to an investigation involving Donald Trump?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: As part of your role in that investigation, were you tasked with analyzing phone records pertaining to the case?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: Was it phone records and also other kinds of records?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: Did the phone records include the AT&T records that are contained in what was admitted earlier today in People's Exhibit 400?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: Did it also include the Verizon records that were admitted into evidence earlier today as People's Exhibit 401?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: Can you tell us, generally, what is contained within those phone records?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: So we generally get two kinds of records. Subscriber records review basic information about the user associated with the phone record. Call detail records, which are kind of a log of all the incoming and outgoing calls associated with whatever number was subpoenaed.

Christopher Conroy: What format are the phone records in when you get them?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Depends on the phone carrier. So, for AT&T, we got them as PDF text files, image files. For Verizon, we get them as Excel spreadsheets and Word documents and PDF.

Christopher Conroy: In your work reviewing various phone records, did you also review information contained in data extractions from Michael Cohen's phones?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: What did you review?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: I reviewed Cellebrite reports, which is the application used to review the data that is extracted on call logs, contact lists, calendar invites, various pieces of metadata, et cetera.

Christopher Conroy: Did that include what is in evidence -- contact information from those phones, that is in evidence currently as People's 263 and 264?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: Did it include text messages that are in evidence as People's 249 through 251, 255 through 260 and 262?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: Did it include call logs that are in evidence as People's 261?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: Did you also review subscriber information contained in People's 400 and 401?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: Did you also review a contact list contained in People's 69B in evidence?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: I did.

Christopher Conroy: In your work on the investigation, did you prepare a summary report -- several summary reports or -- withdrawn. Let me rephrase that. In your work on the investigation, did you prepare a summary report of contact information?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: I did.

Christopher Conroy: What information did you rely on in making that report?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: So I looked at the subscriber records that I mentioned from AT&T and Verizon. I also looked at other pieces of documentary records, text messages, records, email signatures, contact lists produced by The Trump Organization. I also looked at the contact lists that were extracted from Mr. Cohen's cell phones.

Christopher Conroy: What was the purpose of creating this report?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: We wanted to give the jury a sense of how we figured out which phone numbers were associated with which people. Kind of where the phone numbers would show up in the evidence that we ultimately used.

Christopher Conroy: Are the records that you relied on in making this chart all in evidence in this case?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: If we can pull up for the Court and parties and the witness, but not the jury, what's been marked as People's 416 for identification.

Christopher Conroy: Do you recognize what that is?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: What is it?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: This is the phone key I was just talking about.

Christopher Conroy: You created this?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: I did.

Christopher Conroy: Are there redactions in this chart?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: What is redacted?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: The first six digits of all the phone numbers.

Christopher Conroy: Other than that, is this an exact copy of the key that you created?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: At this time, I would offer People's 416 into evidence.

Emil Bove: No objection.

Juan Merchan: 416 is accepted into evidence.

Note: [Whereupon, People's Exhibit 416 was accepted into evidence.]

Christopher Conroy: If we can display that to the jury.

Note: [Displayed]

Christopher Conroy: Can you walk us through what we're looking at?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Sure. So in the right column under the heading "Exhibit," it shows what the source document was and what exhibit number it came from. In the left column called "Phone Number," it is the phone number. And the next column is the name as it appears on the source document, on the exhibit. Under the "source column," it's just the kind of record, email, text, contact list, et cetera.

Christopher Conroy: For some of the rows, there is one name associated with a number, but then there are multiple sources, why is that?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: A lot of the phone numbers we saw in several different places, so we put various documents that we found them on just to corroborate that the phone number did belong to the person that is listed next to them.

Christopher Conroy: Okay. We can take that down.

Christopher Conroy: I now want to talk about another part of the work that you did with the phone records here. Did you create a number of summaries of phone records?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: What was contained in those summaries?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: These are just logs of phone calls between pairs of people.

Christopher Conroy: You mentioned that you received the records that we just discussed earlier in a number of file formats, particularly the records now in People's 400 and 401 from AT&T and Verizon. Starting with the AT&T records, how did you go about putting data in the summary?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: We have a software that reads through the text files, the AT&T files. It allows us to file and sort by phone number, date, caller, et cetera. We uploaded the text files, filtered and sorted and formatted them to look pretty.

Christopher Conroy: What did you do with the Verizon records?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: So the Verizon records were a particular year. They came in as a PDF. We made them text readable, uploaded the text into Excel, wrote simple scripts to extract the information that was put into a format that was file readable. Then we just filtered again by date and time, caller phone number, et cetera. Then formatted them.

Christopher Conroy: In addition to what's in evidence as People's 400 and 401, did you include any other records in the call summaries?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: Do you recall what date?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: In some cases we put calls that were taken off of the call log that is in evidence as 261, which is calls pulled from Mr. Cohen's phone.

Christopher Conroy: What was the purpose of creating these summaries?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: So, as you might have seen, the phone records are somewhat hard to decipher. They don't list which caller is associated with the phone number. They're all different time zones. And kind of, more importantly, they include a lot of extraneous outside calls of people that are not relevant. We wanted to create summaries that were a bit more digestible and easy and by time zone.

Christopher Conroy: You mentioned different time zones, how did you standardize the records for the time zones?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: So it differed between AT&T and Verizon. For AT&T, all the time zones were in UTC. We were able to mass convert them to Eastern Standard Time. We accounted for Daylight Savings Time. For Verizon, the time zone depended on the location they were in when they made or received the call. We went through and determined the location, which was listed on the call detail records, and converted them to all New York time, which is to say, we standardized everything to New York time.

Christopher Conroy: Now, are the summaries of the phone records based solely on the information contained in exhibits already in evidence?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: And are those the exhibits we already discussed?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: In preparing the summaries of the phone records, did you ensure that the information you were including in the summaries fairly and accurately reflected the information in the exhibits in evidence?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: How did you do that?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: So after we made the summaries, we went through line-by-line and compared to the underlying call detail record.

Christopher Conroy: Have you reviewed what's been marked previously as People's 337 through 342 and 344 through 349 for identification?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: And is People's 337 calls between Michael Cohen and Keith Davidson?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: Is People's 338 calls between Michael Cohen and Hope Hicks?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: Is People's 339 calls between Michael Cohen and Dylan Howard?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: Is People's 340 calls between Michael Cohen and David Pecker?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: Is People's 341 calls between Michael Cohen and Keith Schiller?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: Is People's 342 calls between Michael Cohen and Allen Weisselberg?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: Is People's 344 calls between Keith Davidson and Gina Rodriguez?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: Is People's 345 calls between Dylan Howard and Keith Davidson?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: Is People's 346 calls between Dylan Howard and David Pecker?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: Is People's 347 calls between Dylan Howard and Gina Rodriguez?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: Is People's 348 calls between The Trump Organization and Michael Cohen?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: Is People's 349 calls between the Defendant and Michael Cohen?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: And are those the phone summaries that you created?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: At this time, I offer People's 337 through 342 and 344 through 349 into evidence.

Emil Bove: No objection.

Juan Merchan: 337 through 342 and 344 through 349 are received into evidence.

Christopher Conroy: Thank you.

Note: [Whereupon, People's Exhibits 337 through 342 and 344 through 349 were received and marked into evidence.]

Christopher Conroy: If we can pull up what's in evidence as People's 342 for everybody.

Note: [Displayed]

Christopher Conroy: And if you could, again, sort of explain to us about what the different columns are and what we're seeing. Is this a representative example of one of the summaries that you created?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Somewhat short one, but, yes.

Christopher Conroy: But, basically, they all look the same, some may be longer?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: Is this call between Michael Cohen and Allen Weisselberg?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: Do we see that on the top left of the chart?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: We saw some redactions. What is redacted in these charts?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: The first six digits of every phone number.

Christopher Conroy: What are the numbers next to Michael Cohen and the name Allen Weisselberg?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Michael Cohen has 0114 and Allen Weisselberg has 7224 and 4509.

Christopher Conroy: Can you walk us through what this chart demonstrates?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: So the left column is the date and time in Eastern Time. The second column is the date and time in UTC, which is how it was originally recorded in the AT&T records. The "time" column tells whether the call is a text or voicemail. The "from" tells you who the call is from, the phone number. And the "to" column tells you who the call is to. The "duration: Is how long the call was, the minutes.

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: The "source: Column tells you which phone carrier or where we got the records from.

Christopher Conroy: Thank you. And, again, I am not going to walk through all of the exhibits we admitted. Do they all have the same format?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: Thank you. You can take that down. Could we now pull up what is in evidence as People's 247.

Note: [Displayed]

Christopher Conroy: Do you recognize what this is?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: I do.

Christopher Conroy: What is it?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: This is a Cellebrite report showing the metadata associated with the recording that was extracted from Michael Cohen's phone.

Christopher Conroy: Can you see on this report the approximate time that the recording ended?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Not exactly, but you can figure it out. The timestamp of the recording is 10:56 and 42 seconds a.m. in New York time. And the duration of the recording is 2 minutes and 51 seconds. If you add them together, the recording ended at 10:59 and about 30 seconds a.m. in New York City time.

Christopher Conroy: Okay. We can take that down.

Christopher Conroy: Did you also review the call records already in evidence as People's 400 and 401?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: I did.

Christopher Conroy: Did you review records relating to the phone ending in 0114?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: Who did that phone number belong to?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Michael Cohen.

Christopher Conroy: Did you identify incoming calls to that phone number that began at approximately the same time as the recording ended?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: Could we pull up from People's 400 the page, Bates Number DANY ID DJ00002726, which is redacted, to be displayed.

Note: [Displayed]

Christopher Conroy: Do you see the call that we just talked about on here?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: What line number is that call on this report?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: It's line 6126192.

Christopher Conroy: And what was the connection time on that call?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: This is 2:59 and 53 seconds in UTC time. At that time of year, that would have been at 10:59 and 53 seconds New York City time.

Christopher Conroy: How long was the seizure time on this call?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Twenty-three seconds.

Christopher Conroy: And what is the time of this call in relation to when the recording ended that we just looked at on People's 247?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: So the recording ended at 10:59 and about 30 seconds a.m. Eastern Time. So this call was connected about 20, 22, 23 seconds later.

Christopher Conroy: Thank you. We can pull that down. Now, can we pull up just for the parties and the witness and the Judge what has been marked as People's 350 for identification.

Christopher Conroy: Do you recognize this?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: I do.

Christopher Conroy: What is this?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: This is a summary chart of what's in evidence as People's Exhibits 1 through 34.

Christopher Conroy: Did you review and confirm People 350 for identification?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: I did.

Christopher Conroy: Can you describe how you did that?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: So I looked at the chart and I went back to each exhibit that it references and cross-referenced to make sure everything was accurately reflected.

Christopher Conroy: What kinds of documents are People's 1 through 34?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: They are invoices, vouchers from The Trump Organization's Multi Data System and checks.

Christopher Conroy: And does the information in the chart that we designated People's Exhibit 350 for identification exactly reflect information taken from People's Exhibit 1 through 34 in evidence?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Emil Bove: I do have an objection. If we can go to sidebar.

Emil Bove: Judge, our objection is just -- our objection is to the text on the bottom right, "false business records," or something like to that effect. Some things popped up on the screen. Has it been modified?

Christopher Conroy: No.

Emil Bove: They're doing it advance. They're anticipating my objection.

Christopher Conroy: You said your objection --

Emil Bove: Judge, this is unduly argumentative.

Christopher Conroy: This is a summary of the 34 business records, and essentially it's to assist the jury in associating the specific business records with counts. We have no problem with some kind of instruction to the jury that the title is not in evidence, but these are records that we're alleging are business records.

Juan Merchan: What is the purpose for introducing it into evidence now? You can probably do it on summation. You can do it in summation. I think it would be perfectly appropriate at that time.

Christopher Conroy: So could we -- I am just trying to think how we can modify it. Can we call it "alleged false business records?"

Emil Bove: There is a title. It says, "The Counts." I think if you can keep the text on the top, just redact the title on the bottom. Just get the summary in.

Juan Merchan: You have it. I think for summation you won't have an argument. Okay?

Christopher Conroy: Okay.

Note: [Whereupon, the following proceedings were held in open court.]

Juan Merchan: Mr. Bove, we resolved your objection as discussed at the bench.

Emil Bove: Thank you, Judge.

Christopher Conroy: If we can -- when you are ready, display just for the parties, the Court and the witness the summary chart again. Judge, at this time the People offer People's 350 for identification into evidence.

Emil Bove: As modified, no objection.

Juan Merchan: Subject to redaction.

Note: [Whereupon, People's Exhibit 350 was received into evidence.]

Christopher Conroy: If we can display that for everybody.

Note: [Displayed]

Note: [Continued direct examination by Christopher Conroy.]

Christopher Conroy: Can you just walk us through, again -- first of all, what is this summarizing?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: This is summarizing People's Exhibits 1 through 34 in evidence.

Christopher Conroy: And are there three different rows?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: Can you tell us what each row indicates?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: The top row are invoices. The middle row are vouchers. And the bottom row are the checks.

Christopher Conroy: And, then, are there columns by month?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: Starting with the invoices, is there only one invoice for the months of January and February?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: And below that, for January and February, are there two vouchers?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: What information is included in this chart for the vouchers?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: The dollar amount of the voucher entry in some of the months, and all of the months the number associated with the voucher entry.

Christopher Conroy: Just going back up to the invoice, what information is included in the invoice row?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: The date of the invoice and the dollar amount requested on the invoice.

Christopher Conroy: And then below those two things, there is something called "count number," what is that?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Each of these exhibits is associated with a count in the indictment. So, the red "count number" corresponds to that count.

Note: [Whereupon, Theresa Magniccari, Senior Court Reporter was relieved by Laurie Eisenberg, Senior Court Reporter.]

Christopher Conroy: And if we could just continue going down January and February, those two columns, we talked about the one invoice, two vouchers, and is there only one check?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: How many invoices were there, in total, on this chart?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Eleven.

Christopher Conroy: And can you just read which counts they're associated with?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Counts 1, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 26, 29 and 32.

Christopher Conroy: After January and February, is there one invoice for each month for the rest of the year?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: Going down to vouchers, same question. Could you just read the count number for each of the vouchers?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Sure. Counts 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30 and 33.

Christopher Conroy: And is there one voucher for every month in 2017?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: And, finally, in checks, could you read the count number for each check?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Sure. It's counts 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, 28, 31 and 34.

Christopher Conroy: And after January and February, is there one check for each of the remaining months in 2017?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: And if we look at the column -- the column all the way on the right where there are just three blue boxes, can you tell us what those are?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: It's just tallying up the number of each category of record.

Christopher Conroy: And then, at the bottom where it says "business records"?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: This is the total number of business records.

Christopher Conroy: Is that also the total number of counts in the indictment?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: I have nothing further.

Juan Merchan: Mr. Bove, please.

Emil Bove: Thank you, Judge. May I inquire?

Juan Merchan: Yes.

Emil Bove: Thank you.

Note: [Cross-examination by Emil Bove.]

Emil Bove: Mr. Schneider or Mr. Jarmel-Schneider?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Whichever is easier for you.

Emil Bove: What's your preference?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Jarmel-Schneider. Thank you.

Emil Bove: Mr. Jarmel-Schneider, you testified about some call summary charts, right?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Emil Bove: That sounded like a lot of work.

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Emil Bove: At times, arguably, tedious work?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Could be.

Emil Bove: The tolling.

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Honestly, I kind of enjoyed it.

Emil Bove: I hear that. Respect.

Emil Bove: A lot of that work had to take place before the trial, right?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: All of it.

Emil Bove: Because you've been sitting over here [Indicating] the whole trial, correct?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Emil Bove: So, you know that there were summaries that were sort of finalized from a quality control perspective, from your standpoint, and then produced to President Trump before the trial, right?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: What do you mean?

Emil Bove: Versions of those charts that were marked as exhibits, produced and marked as exhibits, were produced to the defense before the trial, right?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Emil Bove: Those are the ones that passed muster, from your perspective?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: I would like to think they all did.

Emil Bove: Right. The ones that were produced before the trial?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Emil Bove: Just so we're clear, the ones that are in evidence now are not actually summaries of every toll between the participants on the chart, right?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: No. That would be tens of hundreds of thousands of calls.

Emil Bove: Just as an example, going to Exhibit 337 is a call summary chart, calls between Michael Cohen and Keith Davidson.

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Emil Bove: And the one that's admitted in evidence is not a summary of every toll that you have between those two individuals, right?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Right. We narrowed down by a time period.

Emil Bove: So, there were some deletions from the charts made this week, right?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Uh, I guess so.

Emil Bove: When you say "narrowed down", some things were cut?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Emil Bove: And so, for Mr. Cohen and Mr. Davidson, there's about a page-and-a-half of calls cut from 2018, right?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: I don't know from the top of my head.

Emil Bove: Let me think about the best way to do this. I want to show you what's been marked for identification as Defense P-1.

Emil Bove: Mr. Bernik, this is just for the parties, the Court and the witness.

Note: [Whereupon, the exhibit is shown on the screens of the witness and the parties.]

Emil Bove: If we could flip to the page that has Government Exhibit 337.

Note: [Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens of the witness and the parties.]

Emil Bove: You see that?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Emil Bove: If you can hold on one second. I think we're having technical difficulty.

Note: [Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens of the witness and the parties.]

Emil Bove: This is the Government's Exhibit List, right, you recognize that?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: This is some version of it, yes.

Emil Bove: Can we take a look at the first page, please.

Note: [Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens of the witness and the parties.]

Emil Bove: You see it's dated April 16, 2024?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Emil Bove: That's right after the trial started, right?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Emil Bove: If we can go back to the part that reflects Exhibits 336 and 337.

Note: [Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens of the witness and the parties.]

Emil Bove: There's Bates ranges in the far-right column, right?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Emil Bove: Those are, basically, the page numbers that were on this exhibit when it was given to the Defense, right?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Emil Bove: Do you have a hard copy of 336 up there?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: I do not.

Emil Bove: Can I trouble the Government for a hard copy of 337?

Note: [Whereupon, the People give documents to Mr. Bove, who then gives the document to the court officer to give to the witness, and the witness reviews the document.]

Emil Bove: People's Exhibit 337 has Bates numbers, and I'll use it to compare -- just a few pages, right?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: That's right.

Emil Bove: Because some pages were deleted, right?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Emil Bove: And they're from 2018, correct?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Emil Bove: And you were here during the cross-examination of Keith Davidson, right?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: I was.

Emil Bove: And you were here when the Defense admitted recordings of conversations between Keith Davidson and Michael Cohen, right?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: I was.

Emil Bove: And then, a subsequent decision was made to delete toll records from the summary chart in 2018?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: No. I don't think that's correct.

Emil Bove: You don't think that time sequence is correct?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: I think the time sequence is correct --

Emil Bove: I'm not going to ask you about the purpose. I'm just asking about the time sequence. You were here early this morning when there were some text messages read between Dylan Howard and Gina Rodriguez, right?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Emil Bove: You admitted a call summary marked Government Exhibit 344 of marked call records of Keith Davidson and Gina Rodriguez, right?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Emil Bove: That's another exhibit where, this week, a significant number of calls were removed, right?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: I don't know about "significant", but they were shortened.

Emil Bove: Three pages worth?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: I don't know off the top of my head.

Emil Bove: Mr. Conroy, do you have a copy of 344?

Christopher Conroy: I need the Bates number. Who is it between?

Joshua Steinglass: Rodriguez and Davidson.

Emil Bove: 4269

Emil Bove: Just to try to move along, you remember deleting several pages from 344, correct?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Emil Bove: Now, you also testified about some call summaries relating to Michael Cohen, correct?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Correct.

Emil Bove: And one of the phone numbers that you looked at with respect to Michael Cohen ended in 0144, right?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: 114

Emil Bove: That's the attention to detail I was talking about. Thank you. So, that's a number that you had to get familiar with because it cut across a bunch of these charts, right?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Emil Bove: You testified that you also familiarized yourself with the electronic phone evidence that's been presented here at the trial, correct?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Emil Bove: And that came in through Mr. Daus, right?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Correct.

Emil Bove: And he testified about the contents of two cell phones, right?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Emil Bove: He called them CP1 and CP2. Do you remember that?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Emil Bove: CP1 was associated with the phone number 0114 was his testimony, right?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: That's correct.

Emil Bove: And you looked at those -- the data extracted from those phones to help prepare the summaries, right?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Emil Bove: Do you recall what that IMEI number was associated with -- you can say no -- with CP1?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: It's like a 20-digit code. I don't know.

Emil Bove: If we could bring up for the witness, the parties, and the Court, Defense Exhibit G-10. Go to Page 3, please.

Note: [Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens of the witness and the parties.]

Emil Bove: Do you see it says "IMEI" labeled at the bottom? It ends in 997431, correct?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Correct.

Emil Bove: So, that's the IMEI associated with the device Mr. Daus talked about as CP1, right?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: That's my understanding, yes.

Emil Bove: He said it had the number ending 0114, correct?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Correct.

Emil Bove: If we could take a look at Government 319. It's in evidence. Everybody can look at this one.

Emil Bove: You remember some testimony about this. It's a screenshot of a text message, right?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Emil Bove: And there were some questions about whether there were phone calls around the time of that bottom message. Do you see what that message says?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Emil Bove: "The President wants to know if you called David Pecker again?" Do you see that?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Emil Bove: At this trial, you're sort of the guardian of the toll records, right?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: I don't know if I'd say that, but if you say so.

Emil Bove: There are no toll records in evidence that reflect calls between Hope Hicks and David Pecker around this time period, are there?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: I don't think that's true, but I would have to look at the underlying records.

Emil Bove: Do you know what they're marked?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: It would be in either People's 400 or 401. Hope Hicks wasn't a part of the Verizon records, so it would be in 401.

Emil Bove: And there's no call summary chart between the phone calls between Hope Hicks and David Pecker, is that correct?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: That's correct.

Emil Bove: The last thing I want to talk about the Government Exhibit 247, which is in evidence.

Emil Bove: If you could bring that up, please.

Emil Bove: Zoom in as best we can.

Emil Bove: So, this is that recording file off the physical device marked CP1, right?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Emil Bove: And you said based on the file name -- there's that timestamp, time field, that it is dated September 6, 2016?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes. That's the timestamp.

Emil Bove: And then we looked at Government Exhibit 400 for a call that you said came in around this time?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Around the time that the recording ended.

Emil Bove: And so, if we could bring up Government Exhibit 400 with the Bates ending 2726, please. If we could ask the Government to do this so we could have the right redactions.

Emil Bove: This can be for everybody. We can zoom in on rows 2691 and 92, please.

Emil Bove: Mr. Conroy asked you some questions about the second one, 26192, right?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Uh-huh. Yes.

Emil Bove: And -- but, the one above it, 26191, is related, correct?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: It's the same call.

Emil Bove: It's the call that goes to a voicemail, right?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: The first one?

Christopher Conroy: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Overruled.

Emil Bove: 26191 is a missed call that goes to a voicemail, reflected in 26192, correct?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: That's not my understanding.

Emil Bove: Were you here this morning when Mr. Dixon testified?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yeah. Can I explain?

Emil Bove: I'm just going to ask you some questions.

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes, I understand.

Emil Bove: You can be questioned again by Mr. Conroy. You were here when he testified, correct?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Emil Bove: I asked him some questions on the feature call on the right.

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Emil Bove: You see where it says "VM"?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Emil Bove: For voicemail?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Emil Bove: That's the way he explained it, correct?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Emil Bove: That's what he said?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Emil Bove: So, this call, then -- the call reflected in 26192, according to Mr. Dixon's testimony, reflects a voicemail, does it not?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: If that's what he said. I -- I don't want to testify to something I'm not an expert in.

Emil Bove: But, you were here when he said VM means voicemail, right?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Emil Bove: If we could zoom out, please. Just to get oriented.

Emil Bove: The three columns there, the right side there's a field that says IMEI, right?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Emil Bove: If we could zoom in on the IMEI column of this whole page, please.

Emil Bove: You were here when Mr. Dixon said the IMEI is the number associated with the physical device itself, right?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes. I think you're blowing up the wrong column, but that is my understanding also. Sorry.

Emil Bove: Thank you. Do we have the IMEI up now?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Emil Bove: So, you were here when Mr. Dixon said this IMEI number is the number associated with the physical device itself, right?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Emil Bove: So, this IMEI associated with the two calls, the missed call and the voicemail that we just talked about, ends 4913, right?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: That's correct.

Emil Bove: You just reminded us, did you not, that the IMEI associated with the CP1 phone ends 4731?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: That's correct.

Emil Bove: So, it's a different device, right?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: That's right.

Emil Bove: So, it's a voicemail, correct?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: If you say so.

Emil Bove: Well, it's "VM"?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Emil Bove: You were here when Mr. Dixon said it, right?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Emil Bove: So, it's a voicemail to a different physical device than the one Mr. Daus testified about, right?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: To a different physical device, yes.

Emil Bove: Nothing further, Judge.

Juan Merchan: Thank you. Any redirect?

Christopher Conroy: Just a few questions.

Note: [Redirect examination by Christopher Conroy.]

Christopher Conroy: I just want to talk, first, about the summary charts that you did. All of the calls on those charts are in evidence in other places, is that right?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: Does that include the calls that Mr. Bove was talking about that when we cut down on the charts, those calls are all still in evidence, correct?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: Why, if you know -- if you know, why were those exhibits shortened?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: My understanding is that the decision was always going to be that we would admit the parts of the call summaries that were related to what had come out in trial. That's the point of doing summary charts. We're pretty far down the road now, so we made decisions about which parts of them to include.

Christopher Conroy: And you were asked a couple of questions about the fact that you knew that the charts -- the original summary charts had been turned over to the Defense, is that right?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: And you know that the new versions had also been turned over to the Defense, right?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: That's correct.

Christopher Conroy: And were you aware that there was no objection to those charts coming into evidence?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: If we could pull up what we were just looking at, the page from People's 400 with the Bates ending 2726.

Christopher Conroy: If we could pull up the same two lines we were just looking at, 26191 and 92.

Christopher Conroy: I believe, earlier, or just a minute or two ago on cross-examination, there was something you wanted to explain about what you saw in this call that interrupted the call that's in evidence as 246. Can you explain that for us?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Sure. So, Mr. Bove -- Bove -- sorry -- asked me if these were two related calls and if the first one was a missed call. My understanding is this was one call that had two legs. I'm not sure exactly where it went. But, this is how AT&T reported a single call that hit multiple stop points through their system before being connected.

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: That was the clarification.

Christopher Conroy: Okay. If you know, do people sometimes get new phones and keep the same phone number?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: I do.

Christopher Conroy: Meaning, you do get a new phone and keep the same phone number?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Christopher Conroy: I have nothing further. Thank you.

Juan Merchan: Mr. Bove?

Emil Bove: Yes. Just briefly. If we could just bring that back up on the screen.

Note: [Recross-examination by Emil Bove.]

Emil Bove: The significance of this call is that the recording from the phone CP1 cut off, right?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Correct.

Emil Bove: Cuts off mid-conversation, correct?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: I don't know if it cut off mid-conversation or at the end of the conversation.

Emil Bove: It cuts off at some point in the conversation, right?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: It ends.

Emil Bove: Right. And it ends before the President is done speaking to Mr. Cohen, correct?

Christopher Conroy: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Emil Bove: You just gave, essentially, what is a hypothesis about these two calls on the screens, right?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: I am just describing the timestamps on the calls.

Emil Bove: But, you're not accounting for what's on the right side that says voicemail?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: I don't think that's true. I apologize. I don't think I'm not accounting for it. I mean, the significance of the call is the timestamp.

Emil Bove: Well, that's part of the significance. The other part is whether or not the phone call was actually answered.

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Not necessarily. I'm not sure if the recording would have actually cut off whether it was answered or not. Could have been it just came in, cut off automatically. I don't know.

Emil Bove: Right. You were here during Mr. Daus' testimony, correct?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Emil Bove: You were here when I asked him: You could not do any forensic analysis to determine the interplay between an incoming call and the voice recording data, right?

Christopher Conroy: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Emil Bove: You are aware the recording cuts off, and that's why you were looking for a toll like this?

Jaden Jarmel-Schneider: Yes.

Emil Bove: Nothing further.

Juan Merchan: Anything else?

Christopher Conroy: Nothing further.

Juan Merchan: Thank you, sir. You can step down.

Note: [Whereupon, the witness is excused.]

Juan Merchan: People, is that it for today?

Joshua Steinglass: Yes, Judge.

Juan Merchan: All right. Jurors, we're going to stop at this time. Before I excuse you, I am required to give you these admonitions: I remind you to please not talk either among yourselves or with anyone else about anything related to the case. Please continue to keep an open mind. Do not form or express an opinion about the defendant's guilt or innocence until all the evidence is in, I have given my final instructions on the law, and I have directed you to begin deliberations.

Juan Merchan: Do not request, accept, agree to accept or discuss with any person the receipt or acceptance of any benefit or payment in return for supplying information concerning the trial.

Juan Merchan: Are you done?

Emil Bove: Sorry.

Juan Merchan: Report directly to me any incident within your knowledge or attempt by anyone to improperly influence you or any member of the jury. Do not visit or view any of the locations discussed in the testimony. Do not use any program or electronic device to search for and view any location discussed in the testimony.

Juan Merchan: Do not read, nor listen to any accounts or discussions related to the case. That includes the reading or the listening to the reading of any transcripts in the trial or the reading of posts on any court sites. Do not attempt to research any fact, issue or law related to the case. Do not communicate with anyone about the case by any means, including by telephone, text messages, telephone, or the internet.

Juan Merchan: Do not Google or search for any information about the case, the law which applies to the case, or the people involved in the case. Have a good weekend. See you Monday at 9:30.

Court Officer: All rise.

Note: [Whereupon, the jurors and the alternate jurors are excused.]

Juan Merchan: Please be seated. Mr. Blanche, I was going to ask the People if I could have a copy of People's 350. I think it would be helpful to the Court in preparing the jury charges. I wanted to ask if there's any objection to my receiving that now.

Todd Blanche: May I just have one moment?

Juan Merchan: Sure.

Juan Merchan: Was that the number of the document chart, 350?

Christopher Conroy: Yes, Judge.

Note: [Whereupon, the Defense confers] .

Todd Blanche: Your Honor, we're fine with that.

Juan Merchan: Okay.

Todd Blanche: On the same topic, our intention was to submit it to the Court, as the Court might have some proposed charges as well. There's certainly no objection to the Court reviewing that.

Juan Merchan: Thank you. I appreciate that. That was going to be my next thing. You should feel free to start submitting any special instructions that you want. We will definitely have a pre-charge conference at the appropriate time. I will make my final decisions then. You can start bringing matters to my attention now, if you like.

Juan Merchan: Tell me about scheduling for next week.

Joshua Steinglass: Um, we expect to call --

Juan Merchan: Two witnesses?

Joshua Steinglass: Yes. Potentially, two witnesses, and I think it's entirely possible that we will rest by the end of next week.

Juan Merchan: Okay. All right.

Joshua Steinglass: Also, there was one other evidentiary matter that Mr. Conroy wanted to raise with the Court if this is a good time.

Juan Merchan: Sure. It is.

Christopher Conroy: This relates to an exhibit numbered People's 79, which is a copy of a Severance Agreement for Allen Weisselberg. We've had, I think, some conversation with Counsel about this. My understanding -- but I'm sure they'll let me know if I'm wrong -- is that while they object to it coming into evidence, if your Honor finds it admissible, they will not -- we will not need to call a witness to put it in. Is that accurate?

Christopher Conroy: It's sort of a relevance objection.

Emil Bove: Right. We just want to resolve our other legal objections. It will come in authenticity-wise subject to the Court's ruling.

Juan Merchan: Can I take a look at it?

Christopher Conroy: Sure. Actually, your Honor, I'll hand up a copy of the chart that's in evidence as 350 with that, as well.

Juan Merchan: Thank you.

Juan Merchan: Mr. Bove, what's your objection?

Emil Bove: Judge, this is the Separation Agreement between The Trump Organization and Mr. Weisselberg. Mr. Weisselberg's absence from this trial is a very complicated issue. I wouldn't be surprised if there ends up being a foundation for a missing witness instruction about the uncalled witnesses being equally unavailable to both sides.

Emil Bove: His posture in this trial is as a hearsay declarant, which the Government is using, basically, in that capacity as a witness. Their theory is he conspired, I think, with Mr. Cohen, that he gave instructions to Mr. McConney. He is in that way, I submit, an uncalled Government witness. To offer this Agreement, which I think would be offered as a way to sort of impeach their own hearsay declarant and suggest there's some kind of bias and motive that he has to either not be here or acting in a certain way, raises a number of complexities in light of Mr. Weisselberg's overall situation.

Emil Bove: We think it's unduly prejudicial. And it's not particularly relevant, especially in a situation where they are offering -- where the Government is offering his statements. I think this would look differently if we had sought to offer hearsay from him. That's not what we were doing.

Juan Merchan: So, it's a hearsay objection?

Emil Bove: Not quite. Because, as I said, just to make sure, there's no business records hearsay objection. If your Honor overrules this right now, we're going to stipulate. Our objection is to relevance and undue prejudice. We don't think it's relevant that he entered into this Agreement after-the-fact. And we think it's unduly prejudicial and confusing in light of the fact that Mr. Weisselberg is in prison right now and not available to anyone.

Juan Merchan: So, I understand the relevance of the objection. Help me understand the undue prejudice objection a little bit more.

Emil Bove: As a result of Mr. Weisselberg's legal situation, I think that he would, likely -- if either side tried to call him, he would, likely, invoke. We are not able to elicit testimony because of those circumstances. We're not able to elicit testimony that would, potentially, impeach some of the hearsay that has been offered.

Emil Bove: And I think the Government is probably in a similar situation. He is, in effect, their witness at this trial as a hearsay declarant. In that way, we don't think the Government is able to impeach their own hearsay declarant, even in this form of impeachment, that he entered into a Settlement Agreement after-the-fact, based on a host of situations that we don't think is relevant at this trial.

Emil Bove: We think those two considerations require that this not come in because of the confusion it would add.

Juan Merchan: Thanks. People?

Christopher Conroy: Judge, as the Court is aware, there has been -- there probably will be more discussion of Mr. Weisselberg and various things related to him in the case. And what we are looking to do is explain, from our perspective, why he's not here. I am sure there will be arguments made by Counsel about whether he should have been here and what not being here means.

Christopher Conroy: I think we need this Agreement. Our view is that Mr. Weisselberg's interests right now are very aligned with the Defendant's. I think this Agreement points that out. Among other things, there are three payments due Mr. Weisselberg during this calendar year for $250,000 each, one in June, one in September, and one in December.

Christopher Conroy: Also, if you take a look at the Agreement, particularly in Section 3, Employee Promises, in 3(B): The employee promises not to verbally or in writing disparage, criticize or denigrate the company or any of its current or former entities, directors, managers, employees, owners or representatives. In Sub D, under 3: The employee promises that, except for acts or testimony directly compelled by subpoena or other lawful process issued by a court of competent jurisdiction, he will not communicate with, provide information to or otherwise cooperate in any way with any other -- with any other person or entity, including his counsel or other agents having or claiming to have any adverse claims against the company, or any person or entity released by this Agreement with regard to the adverse claims, or to take any action to induce, encourage, instigate, aid, abet, or otherwise cause any person or entity to bring or file a complaint, charge, lawsuit or other proceeding of any kind against the company or any person or entity released by this Agreement.

Christopher Conroy: Those are just a couple of the provisions. And Counsel referred to trying to impeach his credibility. We're not trying to do that. What we're trying to do is explain his absence. I think, or I would submit, that this Agreement offers a real explanation for why he is not going to be here in this trial.

Emil Bove: We just, respectfully, disagree with that. This Agreement is not the reason that Mr. Weisselberg is not at this trial. Jeff McConney has a substantial similar Agreement that is in evidence, but he testified at this trial. And his availability or lack thereof is much more straight-forward, has similar terms.

Emil Bove: Nobody tried to invoke that Agreement to prevent him from testifying. That's just not the case. That's not the reason Mr. Weisselberg is not here. The reason Mr. Weisselberg is not a witness to either side is because the District Attorney's Office initiated a perjury prosecution in the lead-up to this case.

Emil Bove: Even that sentence, I know, is a very complicated sentence, Judge. My point is, to get into any of this, it would all have to come out. It's just a rabbit hole that I think is unnecessary for -- and it is being offered to impeach Mr. Weisselberg. It's being offered to show a bias and a motive that the Government's own hearsay declarant, they're saying, has.

Emil Bove: It's a much more complicated situation than that. For those reasons, we don't think it's relevant. And if it is, it should not come in because of the prejudice.

Christopher Conroy: Very quickly, Judge, with respect to Mr. McConney, I believe he's gotten all of his payments, and his Agreement has sort of ended. The other thing I would say is, if Counsel prefers, we would be willing to stipulate that Mr. Weisselberg is in jail for perjury if that solves the problem.

Juan Merchan: I think that that would be one way to solve the problem. My question is, has anyone attempted to get him to come in in some way, by serving him with a subpoena or -- in other words, try to compel his testimony?

Christopher Conroy: Judge, the People have not.

Juan Merchan: And have you? You have an obligation.

Emil Bove: No.

Juan Merchan: You referred to how "both sides" are having difficulty with this issue.

Emil Bove: If I said it that way, I mis -- my point is, I think there's an equally shared access issue. They have chosen to call or not call him. We, obviously, have no burden here. We have not taken steps to try and call him at this trial. It's just -- it would not resolve the situation if we stipulated that he was in prison for perjury.

Emil Bove: I think it actually further supports my point, which is, there are a host of reasons that Mr. Weisselberg is not going to be a witness in this case. They, the Government, have chosen to not take steps to call him. It's a very complicated situation. It's not completely explained by this document. It would be misleading to allow this document in by itself.

Emil Bove: It would be further prejudicial -- I'm not suggesting your Honor is requiring for us to stipulate -- for us to stipulate to some negotiated statement about the perjury situation. And we think that all of this is sort of a sideshow for somebody that is -- the Government's hearsay declarant, who they shouldn't be permitted to impeach in the first place.

Christopher Conroy: The last thing -- hopefully the last thing, it's not that it's the reason, but it's a reason, and it's a significant reason that helps explain why he's not here.

Juan Merchan: I think it would be helpful to me making my decision if I could see that some efforts were taken to compel his appearance. I don't have to do this right now, right?

Christopher Conroy: No.

Juan Merchan: Let me think about it. Right now, it seems to me that we're kind of trying to jump the gun. We want to explain why he's not here, without having made every effort to get him here. Section 3(C) -- actually, it's 3(D), it says: Except for acts or testimony directly compelled by subpoena or other lawful process issued by a court of competent jurisdiction.

Juan Merchan: It seems to me, if I'm understanding correctly, that that step has not yet been taken. Not that it has to be taken. It's a factor for me in making this decision.

Joshua Steinglass: Can I just say one thing on that, Judge?

Juan Merchan: Sure.

Joshua Steinglass: While it's true that we could subpoena him and put him up there cold, the Agreement seems to preclude us from talking to him or him talking to us at the risk of losing $750,000 of outstanding severance pay. So, while it is, theoretically, our prerogative to try to subpoena him, put him up, and see if he would take the Fifth Amendment in real-time, but do this cold, is a -- I don't think is really the entire point.

Joshua Steinglass: Even if it's -- even if it's relevant, I don't think it's the entire point. I think that that Agreement has a very palpable connection to why that could be an exercise in futility or a strategically bad decision, to put a witness on the stand who is under an Agreement like that.

Juan Merchan: Right. I think one way to possibly deal with that is to do it out of the presence of the jury and put him on the stand. He can have counsel present. He can be asked a few questions, and he can say, "I'm not going to answer the questions," and then we can go through the steps that are required for me to find that he's either unavailable or unwilling to testify.

Joshua Steinglass: We could do that, Judge, but then we would still be under the situation of calling the witness to the stand who's under no obligation with us.

Juan Merchan: Right. Then it would be on the record and I've seen it.

Joshua Steinglass: Right.

Juan Merchan: Right now, we're speculating. We're speculating he would honor an Agreement. We're speculating the degree to which this Agreement dictates he could not speak to you. We're speculating to the advice he may or may not be given by counsel. It's difficult to rule like that.

Emil Bove: I want to make one last point, because we're contemplating a lot of process around this. Mr. Weisselberg has never been on the Government's witness list. So, to suddenly try and create this procedure to get around a way to admit this document -- I think we were procedurally barred this morning from offering an exhibit.

Emil Bove: I think there are procedural problems with trying to add him to the witness list at this point, as well.

Juan Merchan: I don't see what one thing has to do with the other. We're not creating any procedure. This is done. This is done with some frequency. I've had people produced from jail testify. I've had other people, who were unwilling to, testify. But, the only way to know that is to put them on the stand, out of the presence of the jury, on the record, under oath.

Emil Bove: My point is slightly different, is that even if Mr. Weisselberg came to this trial and was now willing to testify for any number of reasons he might decide to, we were entitled to notice of that long before this trial started. That's the point I was making.

Juan Merchan: Did you think there was a possibility that at some point the People might call Allen Weisselberg to testify?

Emil Bove: Not based on the witness list, no.

Juan Merchan: Is there anything else?

Joshua Steinglass: No, thank you.

Todd Blanche: Your Honor, we have an application with respect to Mr. Cohen. It's -- we've been pushing the Court, at the risk of stating the obvious, regarding the Gag Order. Mr. Cohen continues to speak publicly about this trial and about President Trump. As recently as, I believe, Wednesday night, he was on TikTok, this time talking extensively about -- he was wearing a white T-shirt with a picture of President Trump behind bars, wearing an orange jumpsuit, and discussing about how he's now announcing he's running for Congress.

Todd Blanche: Our request is, now that we have one week left in the trial, that he be prohibited from talking. The same way President Trump is. The case law speaks to your Honor having the power to do this. Sheppard v. Maxwell explicitly states: There may be instances where the Court not only needs to stop extrajudicial statements from the parties and the lawyers, but also from the witnesses or court officials.

Todd Blanche: Your Honor, it's Friday. We have a couple of days left. It's now becoming -- it's becoming a problem every single day that President Trump is not allowed to respond to this witness, but this witness is allowed to continue to talk. He has stated on social media that he's going to stop talking a couple of different times, and he doesn't. So, our request is that the Court order -- order the Government to instruct the witness to not talk about President Trump or -- or this case until the case is over.

Juan Merchan: Mr. Steinglass?

Joshua Steinglass: Judge, we have repeatedly instructed all of the witnesses in this case, to the extent that we have any control over it, to refrain from making public statements. The fact of the matter is, we have no control over what they do. We have repeatedly, repeatedly asked the witnesses not to do that. Not just Mr. Cohen.

Joshua Steinglass: All the witnesses. The fact of the matter is, these witnesses are not subject to the Gag Order, and we have no remedy if they engage in those activities. So, all we can do -- if the Court is -- if Mr. Blanche is asking the Court to order the People to order the witnesses not to do something, we have already done that.

Joshua Steinglass: Or, to the extent that we have already asked, we have no power to order. And, there's nothing, really, more to say about that.

Juan Merchan: It might be a little bit of a new answer, but I would direct the People to communicate to Mr. Cohen that the judge is asking him to refrain from making any more statements about this case, about Mr. Trump, or about anything related to this case or the process, that that comes from the Bench and that you are communicating that on behalf of the Bench.

Joshua Steinglass: We will do so. Thank you.

Todd Blanche: Thank you, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: Thank you. I'll see you Monday.

Note: [Whereupon, the case is adjourned to 5-13-2024 at 9:30 AM.]
