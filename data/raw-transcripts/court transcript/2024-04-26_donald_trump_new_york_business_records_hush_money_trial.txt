Court Clerk: Continuing case on trial, People v. Donald J. Trump. Appearances, starting with the People.

Joshua Steinglass: For the People, ADA Joshua Steinglass, Susan Hoffinger, Matthew Colangelo, Christopher Conroy, Becky Mangold, and Katherine Ellis.

Emil Bove: Emil Bove for President Trump, seated to my left. I'm joined by Todd Blanche, Susan Necheles, and Gedalia Stern.

Juan Merchan: Good morning. A couple of things to go over. Regarding next week's hearing, I think you received my email, we're changing the time of that from Wednesday at 2:15 to Thursday at 9:30. I also wanted to go over the issue regarding the text from Dylan Howard you wanted me to look at. We spoke about it yesterday.

Joshua Steinglass: To the extent that it may inform your Honor's opinion, we sent counsel, last night, some proposed redactions to remove what I think were their concerns, and I believe they're -- you'll review those.

Juan Merchan: I read the submissions, including all the legal authority that was handed up. I also read the relevant portions of the transcript, which were Pages 1221 through 1226. I note on Page 123, Mr. Bove, at Line 20, says, "I think we're basically on the same page." And then, on 1224, you express your concern. And your concern is, "At some point, cumulatively, it becomes cumulatively prejudicial." So, I appreciate your concern, and I agree that there could come a point where it will possibly become prejudicial.

Juan Merchan: The difficulty is, I don't know at this point what that's going to be. So we're just going to have to keep going through it. You'll make your objections. I'll consider the objections. And at some point, we may get there. I am relying, primarily, on People v. Settles, S-E-T-T-L-E-S, 46 N.Y.2d 154, at Page 169. This is a Court of Appeals decision. "Naturally, there can be no precise demarkation or formulation of the proof which will constitute sufficient support of evidence of a declaration against penal interests.

Juan Merchan: By its very nature, the determination involves a delicate balance of diverse factors and is entrusted to the sound judgment of the trial court which is aptly suited to weigh the circumstances surrounding the declaration and the evidence used to bolster its reliability." So, that's really what's going to guide this Court.

Juan Merchan: But, the fact that you said you're pretty much on the same page, we're in agreement with who is a co-conspirator in this case: Dylan Howard. We're in agreement that at least some, if not most, of the responses are coming in for some purpose. And we're also in agreement that there will be redactions to that.

Emil Bove: Yes, Judge. Thank you. I appreciate and understand all of that. Just for the record, when you said we're in agreement about who's a co-conspirator, we understand the Court's ruling, and we're abiding by it. Our objection has been noted. And I will confer with Mr. Steinglass and the Government over the weekend about the proposed redactions, and we'll get back to the Court on Tuesday.

Juan Merchan: Of course. Once you do that, please let me know what you suggest the instruction should be to the jury, what is it they're considering that other language for.

Emil Bove: Yes, Judge. Thank you.

Juan Merchan: We're going to break today at 12:30 to hear the People's motion, motion to compel.

Matthew Colangelo: Thank you. One update on that. After further discussions with the third party's counsel this morning, we think we no longer need the Court's intervention on that today. We will bring it to your attention should it become necessary.

Juan Merchan: Great. We'll go to one o'clock. Is there anything else?

Joshua Steinglass: There's a few things. First, is your Honor going to address the issue with the jury that was raised at the end of the day about the, what we consider to be, improper impeachment by omission by Mr. Bove?

Juan Merchan: Would you like to be heard, Mr. Bove?

Emil Bove: Yes, Judge. Just to clarify, my intentions for this morning on this issue are to begin by basically saying to Mr. Pecker: I apologize for any confusion about that, clarify a little bit about his relationship with Ms. Hicks, and move on. There's grand jury testimony on this issue for where a specific question was asked.

Emil Bove: I'll draw the witness' attention to that and go through it. I've reviewed Bornholdt and its authorities, and I'll lay a proper foundation.

Juan Merchan: Thank you. I think that's sufficient to address the issue.

Joshua Steinglass: Next. Whatever Mr. Bove's intentions were with regard to the questions about prior meetings with the DA's Office and reviewing materials, I think that he left a misleading impression that that contact was somehow improper, and I don't think it would be appropriate to wait until the end of the case to give the CJI instruction on pretrial preparation.

Joshua Steinglass: I'm handing it up to the Court. The Court has been very reasonable about giving mid-trial curative instructions or limiting instructions, and I would ask that you give this instruction to the jury this morning.

Juan Merchan: Any objections?

Emil Bove: May I have just one moment, Judge?

Juan Merchan: Sure.

Emil Bove: Judge, I think there was an instruction along these lines in your preliminary instructions, so I think the jury is aware of this issue. I'm not sure it's necessary.

Juan Merchan: There was a brief reference to it. It was very brief, if I remember. It's: I advise you, it's common or permissible for the prosecutor and counsel to meet with witnesses before they testify. I believe that was, pretty much, what I said. So, I can give this instruction just to modify.

Joshua Steinglass: Okay. I also have a proposed instruction. It doesn't have to be given today. But, it's an instruction on redaction, so the jury doesn't draw any improper inferences from the fact that certain material, personal material or otherwise material that the parties have agreed is irrelevant should not be before the jury or is prejudicial, so that the jury doesn't draw any improper inferences from the existence of those redactions.

Joshua Steinglass: Next. I think, again, whether intentionally or unintentionally, Mr. Bove's questioning yesterday improperly conflated the federal prosecutors and state prosecutors, referring to both as "the Government". Of course, that's, you know -- the state prosecutors are referred to as "the People". I am not telling Mr. Bove how to refer to us, if that's how he chooses to refer to us. But, I do think he needs to be clear when he's questioning the witness about prior interviews, which prosecutors he is talking about.

Joshua Steinglass: So, if that's unclear from the question, I will object, and I just wanted to explain.

Juan Merchan: That's fair, because there was more than one prosecutor's office involved here.

Joshua Steinglass: Thank you. Finally, Judge, I just want to bring the Court's attention to that we caught a reference in People's 174A to a lie detector that was gonna be taken live. I don't know if your Honor noticed it when we had the witness on the stand. I don't think your Honor precluded reference to the lie detector.

Joshua Steinglass: Just the results of the lie detector. We've taken a broad view of that and have redacted references where we've seen them. I notified counsel and swapped out a new version of 174A that contains a redaction just of the word "lie detector".

Juan Merchan: Is that it for the People?

Joshua Steinglass: Yes, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: How about the Defense?

Emil Bove: No, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: Okay. We can get the witness, please.

Court Officer: Witness entering.

Note: [Whereupon, the witness, David Pecker, having been previously duly sworn and/or affirmed, resumes the witness stand and testifies as follows.]

Juan Merchan: Good morning, Mr. Pecker. Welcome back. I remind you that you're still under oath. Get the jury, please.

Court Officer: All rise. Jury entering.

Note: [Whereupon, the jurors and the alternate jurors are present and properly seated.]

Court Clerk: Continuing case on trial, People v. Donald J. Trump. All parties and all jurors are present.

Juan Merchan: Good morning, jurors. Jurors, before we continue with the cross of Mr. Pecker, I wanted to give you an instruction regarding yesterday's testimony. You heard testimony yesterday about the prosecution speaking to Mr. Pecker about the case before the witness testified at this trial. The law permits the prosecution or an attorney to speak to a witness about a case before the witness testifies and permits the prosecution or an attorney to review with the witness the questions that will or may be asked at trial, including questions that may be asked on cross-examination.

Juan Merchan: You have also heard testimony that a witness, Mr. Pecker, read or reviewed certain materials pertaining to this case before he testified at trial. The law permits a witness to do so. Speaking to a witness about his or her testimony and permitting a witness to review materials pertaining to the case before the witness testifies is a normal part of preparing for trial.

Juan Merchan: It is not improper, as long as it is not suggested that the witness depart from the truth. Mr. Bove.

Emil Bove: Thank you, Judge.

Emil Bove: May I inquire, Judge?

Juan Merchan: Yes.

Note: [Continued cross-examination by Emil Bove.]

Emil Bove: Good morning, Mr. Pecker.

David Pecker: Good morning.

Emil Bove: When we were talking at the end of the day yesterday, we were speaking about a meeting with the federal prosecutors in August of 2018. Do you remember that?

David Pecker: Yes, I do.

Emil Bove: That was my fault. There was some confusion in the questioning about what had been said and whether Hope Hicks came up. Do you remember that?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: I want to apologize and move on to another meeting from that. If I ask a bad question today, I think Mr. Steinglass will tell me, but you can as well, and we'll make sure that I'm clear.

David Pecker: Thank you.

Emil Bove: As I said, we were talking about Hope Hicks, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And you knew Ms. Hicks long before August of 2015, correct?

David Pecker: I did.

Emil Bove: She had worked at Hiltzik Strategies?

David Pecker: She did.

Emil Bove: That is a communication and strategy firm, correct?

David Pecker: It is.

Emil Bove: They did some work for AMI?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: That's one of the ways you met Ms. Hicks, right?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Emil Bove: I think you said she did some work for Star Magazine?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: Which was an AMI publication under your watch?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: You testified on Tuesday that she also worked as President Trump's Communications Director at some point?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: So, what I was asking you about yesterday was your testimony in response to Mr. Steinglass' questions about whether Ms. Hicks was in that meeting in August of 2015, right?

David Pecker: Yes. That's correct.

Emil Bove: And to be fair, you said that -- on direct, that she was in and out of the meeting, right?

David Pecker: That's what I said.

Emil Bove: It's not as if you suggested to the jury that she participated in the meeting, correct?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Emil Bove: And you did not suggest to the jury that you have a recollection of her speaking during the meeting, correct?

David Pecker: That's absolutely correct.

Emil Bove: Now, you testified in federal grand jury proceedings, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And that was also in August of 2018, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And it was about two weeks after the meeting that we were talking about at the end of the day yesterday, right?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Emil Bove: August 13, 2018, does that sound right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And there was a court order there, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: Just like today?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And you were under oath, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: Just like today?

David Pecker: Just like today.

Emil Bove: And do you recall being asked the question: "Did you meet with Donald Trump and Michael Cohen, an employee of the Trump Organization, at Trump Tower?" Do you recall that question?

Joshua Steinglass: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained. Mr. Bove, if you are going to advise the witness to a particular portion of the transcript, please advise the prosecution so that they can turn to it.

Emil Bove: Yes. Mr. Bernik, for the Court the parties and Mr. Pecker, can we please bring up the document marked for identification as Exhibit A104. If we can go to Page 5. Please and zoom in on Lines 17 through 19.

Note: [Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screen of the witness and the parties, and the witness reviews the exhibit.]

Emil Bove: Sir, this is from your federal grand jury testimony, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: Do you recall being asked this question?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: If we could zoom out, please, Mr. Bernik, and turn to the next page, Page 6.

Emil Bove: Do you see at Lines 6 and 7, you were asked to tell the grand jury what happened at this meeting?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: When you were asked that question, you understood it was in reference to the August 2015 meeting, right?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Emil Bove: And you answered the question, obviously, right?

David Pecker: Could I see the answer?

Emil Bove: Yes. Yes.

Emil Bove: We can zoom out entirely, Mr. Bernik, and give Mr. Pecker an opportunity to review.

Note: [Whereupon, the witness reviews the exhibit on his screen.]

David Pecker: You said it was 6 and 7?

Emil Bove: Yes.

Emil Bove: We can go to Page 7 now, please.

Note: [Whereupon, the witness reviews the exhibit on his screen.]

Emil Bove: Let me know when you're done.

David Pecker: Can we turn back to 6?

Emil Bove: Of course.

Note: [Whereupon, the witness reviews the exhibit on his screen.]

David Pecker: The next page, please.

Emil Bove: Can you go to Page 7 please, Mr. Bernik?

Note: [Whereupon, the exhibit is shown on the witness' screen and the parties' screens, and the witness reviews the exhibit.]

David Pecker: I read Page 7.

Emil Bove: Page 8, please, Mr. Bernik.

Note: [Whereupon, the exhibit is shown on the witness' screen and the parties' screens, and the witness reviews the document.]

David Pecker: Okay. Page 8.

Emil Bove: Thank you. So those pages, Pages 5 through 8, constitute your answer about the August 2015 meeting, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: During that testimony in August of 2018, you did not describe any specific statements made by Ms. Hicks, correct?

Joshua Steinglass: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Emil Bove: Let's talk a little bit about what was said during the August 2015 meeting. You said on your direct that there was discussion about Bill and Hillary Clinton, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And at the time of this meeting, August 2015, the National Enquirer was already running stories about Bill and Hillary Clinton, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: That was going on before the meeting, right?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Emil Bove: And that was because you had made a business decision that it was good for the National Enquirer to run those stories, correct?

David Pecker: I did.

Emil Bove: We talked about, yesterday, how you were going to the research meetings, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And looking at the data?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And thinking about what made sense from a business perspective for AMI?

David Pecker: Correct.

Emil Bove: What was consistent with your fiduciary obligations at AMI?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: So, before the August 2015 meeting, you made a decision that it made sense for AMI to run articles about Bill and Hillary Clinton, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And those articles were negative, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: So, it was easy for you to say during the August 2015 meeting that you would continue to do that, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: That was no issue for you?

David Pecker: No.

Emil Bove: We talked yesterday about things that were mutually beneficial. That was entirely beneficial to AMI?

Joshua Steinglass: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Emil Bove: Running those stories were beneficial to AMI, correct?

David Pecker: Running the stories were beneficial to AMI. Correct.

Emil Bove: And doing what was good for AMI was standard operating procedure?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: Now, you testified on Tuesday that during this August 2015 meeting, there was also a discussion about running negative stories about President Trump's opponents, right?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Emil Bove: And you testified that there was discussion of that topic during the August 2015 meeting, do you remember that?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And three specific opponents, preliminary opponents came up, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: Ben Carson, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: Marco Rubio, right?

David Pecker: Right.

Emil Bove: And Ted Cruz, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And you were shown some exhibits by the Government that related to stories the National Enquirer ran about those three men, correct?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Emil Bove: There wasn't much new content in those stories, was there?

David Pecker: I would have to reread the stories to answer that question.

Emil Bove: We'll take a look at the stories in a minute. But, let me ask you this: It was standard operating procedure for the National Enquirer to, sort of, recycle content from other publications and frame it slightly differently, correct?

David Pecker: Correct.

Emil Bove: That's cost effective?

David Pecker: Correct.

Emil Bove: Information from the public domain goes into the National Enquirer. It's quick and easy. Correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: Good for business?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: Consistent with your fiduciary obligations, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And for at least some of the articles that you testified about on Tuesday, that's exactly what you did, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: There was already negative information in the public domain about Ben Carson, and so you ran it in the National Enquirer, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And because that was quick, and efficient, and cost effective, you would have done that whether or not you had discussed it with President Trump, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: Mr. Bernik, if we could take a look at Government Exhibit 153A, please. This can be shown to the jury. This is in evidence.

Emil Bove: Mr. Pecker, this is one of the exhibits we looked at on Tuesday, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And there are five headlines here relating to Ben Carson, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And there's some dates on the page. Do you see them?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And the date range is, basically, from what I can tell, October 2015 to December of 2015, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: So, you see that there's an article -- the top article on this page relates to some kind of issue with a surgery performed by Dr. Carson, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And in this timeframe, 2015, you were leading AMI, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And you were familiar with what was going on with other publications, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: You had to be, right, in order to do your job?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And you had to be on top of what was in the public domain at the time, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: You had to keep track of current events, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: So, you knew, did you not, that in May 2015, The Guardian published an article regarding several malpractice suits against Dr. Carson, correct?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Emil Bove: And so, in May 2015, long before any of the articles on this page, The Guardian had covered this issue, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And, in fact, The Guardian article referenced seven malpractice claims against Dr. Carson, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And the article referenced on the top of the screen, that's -- the child there, her name is Karly Bailey, right?

David Pecker: I don't remember her name.

Emil Bove: Mr. Bernik, if we could, for Mr. Pecker, the parties and the Court, bring up what's been marked for identification as Defense Exhibit A133.

Note: [Whereupon, the exhibit is shown on the witness' and the parties' screens.]

Emil Bove: If you could turn to Page 3, please.

Emil Bove: And I want to see, Mr. Pecker, if this refreshes your recollection about the name of the child.

Note: [Whereupon, the witness reviews the exhibit on his screen.]

David Pecker: Yes, it does.

Emil Bove: What was her name?

David Pecker: Karly Bailey.

Emil Bove: We can take that down. Thank you. If we could bring back up People's 153A. That can be for everyone, please.

Emil Bove: That photograph on the top of a child is actually recycled from The Guardian article, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And so, there are four articles on this page that relate to these medical malpractice claims, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And all of them contain information that was recycled from a publication months earlier in The Guardian, right?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Emil Bove: And do you recall that in 2016, The Guardian website had about 40 million unique users in the United States?

David Pecker: I don't recall that.

Emil Bove: Mr. Bernik, can we please bring up a document marked for identification. This is just for the Court, the parties and Mr. Pecker. It's been marked for identification as A138.

Note: [Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the witness' screen and the parties' screens, and the witness reviews the exhibit on his screen.]

David Pecker: I don't see where it says 40 million.

Emil Bove: Can we turn to the next page, please?

Note: [Whereupon, the witness reviews the exhibit on his screen.]

David Pecker: Yeah. 40 million unique users.

Joshua Steinglass: Objection. Move to strike his answer in terms of the base of his knowledge.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Emil Bove: We can take that down, Mr. Bernik.

Emil Bove: Did that document refresh your recollection that, in 2016, The Guardian had about 40 million unique users on its website?

Joshua Steinglass: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

David Pecker: I --

Juan Merchan: No. Don't answer the question.

David Pecker: Okay.

Emil Bove: If we could bring up People's 153A, please. This is for everyone, please.

Emil Bove: You see the fourth headline on this page?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: There's a reference to military service?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: It's hard for me to see from here, but I think it's dated November 11, 2015?

David Pecker: November 11th.

Emil Bove: And do you recall, this is also a situation where the National Enquirer posted information that was already in the public domain?

David Pecker: I don't recall this exact article. We're -- I don't recall exactly where the information was derived from this article.

Emil Bove: Do you recall, five days earlier, Politico ran a headline: Exclusive: Carson claimed West Point scholarship but never applied?

David Pecker: I don't recall.

Emil Bove: If you could please bring up for the the parties, the witness, and the Court the document marked A134.

Note: [Whereupon, the exhibit is on the witness' screen and the parties' screens.]

Emil Bove: Just take a look at that.

Emil Bove: Can I have one moment, please?

Juan Merchan: Sure.

Emil Bove: Have you had a chance to look at that?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: We can take that down, please.

Emil Bove: Does that refresh your recollection that about five days before the National Enquirer article, Politico ran an article with the title: Exclusive: Carson claimed West Point scholarship but never applied?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: Mr. Bernik, if we could take a look for everyone at People's 153C.

Emil Bove: And these are articles that you were shown by the Government, during your direct examination, relating to Marco Rubio, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And these articles are also based on information that was not exclusive to the National Enquirer, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: The top article actually refers to a book that had been published about Mr. Rubio, correct?

David Pecker: I don't recall the book.

Emil Bove: Mr. Bernik, if you could please bring up for the Court, Mr. Pecker, and the parties, a document marked for identification as Defense Exhibit A141.

Note: [Whereupon, a document is shown on the parties' screens.]

Emil Bove: Do you have that on your screen?

David Pecker: No.

Emil Bove: I can hand a copy up.

David Pecker: Okay.

Emil Bove: If I could hand a copy up to the Court, as well.

Juan Merchan: Thank you.

Emil Bove: Have you had a chance to look at that?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: That was a copy of the National Enquirer article where we saw the headline on the screen, right?

David Pecker: Yes. That's correct.

Emil Bove: Having reviewed that, does that refresh your recollection that what was really going on in the article was you were reviewing a book that had been published, right?

David Pecker: Correct.

Emil Bove: So, it wasn't new information published, correct?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Emil Bove: Substantially, everything in the exhibits you were shown in 153A, 153B and 153C, what was going on was the National Enquirer was recycling information from other publications because it was cost effective and made business sense?

Joshua Steinglass: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Overruled. You can answer.

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And you talked about the National Enquirer relying on sources, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: There was a source network of sorts, right?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Emil Bove: And one of the things that can be valuable to somebody in this industry is cultivating a network of sources, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: So the people that work for you can draw on those sources to get sensitive details, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: But, that's not what was happening with respect to the articles we just looked at, right?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Emil Bove: That was a different part of the business, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: Where you were taking information that was public and posting it on the website?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And you testified on Tuesday that it was your objective to keep the August 2015 meeting confidential, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And I think you said, "highly, highly confidential," right?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Emil Bove: And you wanted to keep the meeting as quiet as possible. I think you used those words, too.

David Pecker: I did.

Emil Bove: But, it actually became public prior to the election that you were doing those things for President Trump, correct?

David Pecker: Uh, yes.

Emil Bove: People picked up on it, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: Nothing was hidden, correct?

Joshua Steinglass: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Emil Bove: But, you testified, I think, yesterday about a Wall Street Journal article relating to Karen McDougal, do you remember that?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: That was People's Exhibit 180, right?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Emil Bove: That article came out before the election, you said, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: This is in evidence. Can we bring that up, People's 180, please?

Emil Bove: Can you zoom in on the top half, please.

Emil Bove: You see it? Above the headline, it says, "Election 2016," right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: So, this is Wall Street Journal coverage prior to the 2016 election, correct?

David Pecker: That is correct.

Emil Bove: If we can go to Page 2 of the exhibit, please, and zoom in on the second to last paragraph.

Emil Bove: Do you see where it says "Since last year, the Enquirer has supported Mr. Trump's presidential bid, endorsing him and publishing negative articles about some of his opponents"?

David Pecker: Yes, I see that.

Emil Bove: So, this was out there prior to the election, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: You can take that down. Thank you.

Emil Bove: I want to stick with the August 2015 meeting. Okay?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: At that meeting, the concept of "catch and kill" was not discussed, correct?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Emil Bove: And there was no discussion of a financial dimension to any agreement at that meeting, correct?

David Pecker: Yes. That's correct.

Emil Bove: And you testified on Tuesday about a Source Agreement with somebody named Dino Sajudin, do you remember that?

David Pecker: Yes, I do.

Emil Bove: You said you learned of Mr. Sajudin's false story in about October of 2015?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Emil Bove: You testified on Tuesday that you never discussed this story directly with President Trump, correct?

David Pecker: That is correct.

Emil Bove: And President Trump never paid you any money in connection with that Sajudin story, right?

David Pecker: No, he did not.

Emil Bove: And Cohen didn't pay you any money, either, did he?

David Pecker: No.

Emil Bove: You testified Tuesday there was a Source Agreement between AMI and Mr. Sajudin, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: That is People's Exhibit 154 in evidence, if we could bring that up.

Emil Bove: This is that Source Agreement, correct?

David Pecker: Yes, it is.

Emil Bove: I think you said on Tuesday that this is a standard AMI document, am I right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: A document that AMI used in connection with standard operating procedures?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: Yesterday, you said that AMI had entered into hundreds of thousands of Source Agreements like this, correct?

David Pecker: Over the years, yes.

Emil Bove: Over decades, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: Even before you were leading AMI, right?

David Pecker: Before. [Nods yes].

Emil Bove: Now, if you can please zoom in on the payment line.

Emil Bove: So, I think you testified on Tuesday that the standard time period for one of these agreements was 90 or 120 days?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And, here, somebody -- there's a blank in a template, right? You see where it says, "Exclusivity period"?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And somebody filled in "three months" or 90 days?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Emil Bove: Do you see the payment line where it says, "Payable upon publication as set forth below"?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And so, there was no money due to Mr. Sajudin when this agreement was signed, correct?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Emil Bove: And you believed that if this story was true, it was worth a lot of money, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: What I'm asking about now is your -- what was in your mind in 2015 as this was happening. Okay?

David Pecker: I understand.

Emil Bove: So, when it was reported to you that somebody was saying the things that Mr. Sajudin was saying, you believed that if those were true, it could be the biggest National Enquirer article ever?

David Pecker: That is correct.

Emil Bove: And I think you testified about the Enquirer's coverage of Elvis Presley's death, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: I think, if I'm recollecting correctly, there were about 6.5 million sales associated with the National Enquirer's coverage of that death?

David Pecker: That is correct.

Emil Bove: And you thought that if this story was true, Mr. Sajudin's claim was true, that it could sell 10 million National Enquirers, right?

David Pecker: I did.

Emil Bove: So, if this story was true, you were gonna run it, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: Because you had a fiduciary obligation to do that, right?

David Pecker: That is correct.

Emil Bove: It would have made business sense, to put it mildly, to run such an article if it was true, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And as soon as you heard the story about Mr. Sajudin, you knew that to be the case, right?

David Pecker: I did.

Emil Bove: It took AMI a little bit of time to verify or try to verify the story, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And I think you testified that it wasn't really completed, you didn't have a firm sense of it until late December 2015?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Emil Bove: So, several weeks, maybe a month, at least, after this agreement was signed, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And at some point in the time between when this agreement was signed and when the vetting process was completed, Mr. Sajudin started to make threats, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: He was threatening to go someplace else, right?

David Pecker: That is correct.

Emil Bove: And that is why you decided to pay Mr. Sajudin $30,000, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: Because you could not have him taking his story to another publication if it was true, right?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Emil Bove: It would be too great a loss to AMI to lose control of such a story, if true, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: Mr. Bernik, could you please publish People's 155. This is also in evidence.

Emil Bove: So, this is the Amendment to that Source Agreement, right?

David Pecker: Yes, it is.

Emil Bove: And this one is dated December 17, 2015. Do you see that at the bottom?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And this agreement was entered into after Mr. Sajudin started to make those threats, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And in exchange for $30,000, Mr. Sajudin agreed to the exclusivity period in perpetuity, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: This is where you bought the rights of the story forever?

David Pecker: I did.

Emil Bove: And that is because it was still possible, in your mind, when this agreement was signed, that the story was true?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Emil Bove: And you could not walk away from that possibility, however small it might be, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: Walking away from Mr. Sajudin's story would not make business sense, right?

David Pecker: No.

Emil Bove: It would not have been your standard operating procedure, correct?

David Pecker: No.

Emil Bove: We can take that down. Thank you.

Emil Bove: I want to talk a little about Ms. McDougal, if that's okay.

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: Just to be clear, President Trump did not pay you any money related to Karen McDougal, right?

David Pecker: No.

Emil Bove: Nor did Cohen, correct?

David Pecker: Correct.

Emil Bove: I want to focus on 2016, when there were negotiations relating to and involving Ms. McDougal. Okay?

David Pecker: Okay.

Emil Bove: When you first learned about this story, you understood that Ms. McDougal did not want to publish it, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: She did not want to, right?

David Pecker: She did not want to.

Emil Bove: What she wanted to do was restart her career, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And after you learned that, you thought there was an opportunity for AMI to help her do that, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And that's because she had worked before on Men's Fitness magazine, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: I think she was one of the first females that was on the cover of that magazine, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: In '99?

David Pecker: That's right.

Emil Bove: Was that after you started?

David Pecker: Right after I started.

Emil Bove: So, you and Ms. McDougal went back, in a way, right?

David Pecker: I didn't know her.

Emil Bove: But, you knew that she had done work on that cover for AMI, right?

David Pecker: Not until I was told in that June of 2016.

Emil Bove: So, is it fair to say that when you first started out at AMI, it took some time to get up to speed, right?

David Pecker: Well, first, that -- the Men's Fitness, that title was a weaker magazine, so we purchased it. The purchase was in 2002.

Emil Bove: One of those purchases that involved Mr. Schwarzenegger in 2002, 2003?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: Thank you for clarifying that. I'm sorry about that. Getting back to 2016, you understood that Ms. McDougal's main interest was not publishing the story, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And you testified about a meeting that you had with one of your investor's offices in New Jersey, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: You said that President Trump got through to you on the phone during that meeting?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: Was that at Chatham Asset Management?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: What was the presentation that day?

David Pecker: I was reading the quarterly results, biannual results.

Emil Bove: Somebody interrupts the meeting, that presentation, and says, "President Trump is on the phone," right?

Joshua Steinglass: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Overruled.

David Pecker: Didn't say "President" Trump.

Emil Bove: You knew you had an important --

David Pecker: Yes. He said, "Donald Trump is on the phone."

Emil Bove: When you got on the phone, you knew that it was President Trump, right?

Joshua Steinglass: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Emil Bove: You talked to President Trump that day in connection with the meeting, right?

Joshua Steinglass: Objection.

Juan Merchan: What's your objection?

Joshua Steinglass: He wasn't "President" Trump in June of 2016.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Emil Bove: If I could just have a moment, Judge?

Emil Bove: I just want to make sure we're talking about the same meeting. Okay? There was a meeting where you said you gave an investors' presentation to, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: During that meeting, you received a phone call, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: Who was on the phone?

David Pecker: Donald Trump.

Emil Bove: When was the meeting?

David Pecker: June of 2016.

Emil Bove: And during that conversation, during that call, you discussed Karen McDougal, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And you told President Trump that Ms. McDougal did not want to publish the story, correct?

Joshua Steinglass: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Emil Bove: What do you remember about the phone call?

David Pecker: Mr. Trump called my -- my office in -- either it was in New York or Florida. And since I was in Chatham, New Jersey, my assistant transferred the call to -- to Chatham. And when the call came in, the assistant in the office -- small office -- came over and asked me to come out, that Donald Trump was on the phone.

David Pecker: And when I spoke to Mr. Trump, he said that he wanted to know what was -- he asked me -- he said, "I spoke to Michael. And I wanted to talk to you about Karen McDougal." So, he said: Is it true that there's a Mexican group that's looking to buy the story for $8 million?" And I said, "No, I don't believe that's true." Two, he said that -- that -- [Pause] -- um -- [Pause] -- I want to recollect it completely.

Emil Bove: Thank you.

David Pecker: He said that, um -- [Pause] -- he normally -- oh. I said that -- that, "This story about Karen, since she's claiming that she has a relationship with you, should be taken off the market." And Mr. Trump said, "I don't normally -- I don't buy stories because it always gets out." And then I said, "I still think you should buy the story." And Mr. Trump said to me, "I'll speak to Michael, and he'll get back to you."

Emil Bove: And so, as you sit here today, you remember that during that conversation, you said to President Trump: It is my understanding that she doesn't want her story published?

David Pecker: [Pause]. Yes. I did. I remember saying that.

Emil Bove: And you testified about that --

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: -- at this trial, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: On April 23rd?

David Pecker: Yes. I just wanted to make sure and remember.

Emil Bove: Yeah. I appreciate it. Sometimes it takes another question.

David Pecker: That's correct.

Emil Bove: I want to talk a little bit about Chatham Asset Management, okay?

David Pecker: Okay.

Emil Bove: There was later a lawsuit involving Chatham, relating to some of those events in the Summer of 2016, right?

Joshua Steinglass: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Overruled.

David Pecker: Can you clarify about with respect to lawsuits?

Emil Bove: iPayments sued Chatham Asset Management, correct?

David Pecker: The former chairman of iPayment, the company. Not the company itself.

Emil Bove: And you were named as a defendant in that lawsuit, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And the allegations that are at issue in the lawsuit were going on in that Summer of 2016, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And you talked about the issues of iPayments with Cohen, right?

David Pecker: I did.

Emil Bove: And you also tried to get Cohen a job at iPayments, right?

David Pecker: No. I can clarify that.

Emil Bove: Please.

David Pecker: Michael Cohen pitched -- he requested for me a position at iPayment. He was looking to become the new president, the new chairman, because the former chairman was terminated.

Emil Bove: Did you talk to the chairman of iPayments about that?

David Pecker: No. I spoke to Chatham about it. And they had no interest in Michael Cohen.

Emil Bove: Do you recall telling the Federal Government that the chairman of iPayments did not want Cohen to take Pecker's place?

Joshua Steinglass: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Emil Bove: Judge, can we have a quick sidebar?

Juan Merchan: Yes.

Emil Bove: Thank you.

Note: [Whereupon, the following proceedings were held at sidebar.]

Emil Bove: Thank you, Judge. I don't mean to be dense. I just want to make sure I'm following the objection right now. I asked if he recalled saying that. He said no. My next plan was to refresh his recollection that that was said.

Juan Merchan: What's your objection?

Joshua Steinglass: It's two-fold. One, I think that was an improper impeachment technique. Second of all, it's more, basically, a relevance objection. What is the relevance of the fact that Michael Cohen tried to get a job, that there was lawsuits involving companies that have nothing to do with this?

Emil Bove: The relevance is that Cohen and Mr. Pecker were working together personally, separate and apart from what President Trump was doing.

Juan Merchan: I'll allow it.

Emil Bove: Thank you, Judge.

Note: [Whereupon, the following proceedings were held in open court.]

Note: [Whereupon, Senior Court Reporter Lisa Kramsky relieves Senior Court Reporter Laurie Eisenberg, and the transcript continues on the next page.]

Juan Merchan: Thank you. The objection is overruled.

Emil Bove: So before that break, we were talking about iPayments, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And my question had been: Did you and Mr. Cohen discuss Cohen getting a job at iPayments, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And you did discuss that with Cohen, correct?

David Pecker: I did.

Emil Bove: And I think you said, before the break, that you did not discuss Cohen getting a job with iPayments, directly with iPayments, right?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Emil Bove: And I think you said before that sidebar that you had only discussed that with Chatham Asset Management, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: But do you recall telling the Federal Government that the Chairman of iPayments did not want Cohen to take Pecker's place, right?

Joshua Steinglass: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained. That's consistent with what he testified to.

Emil Bove: In this same time frame, in the summer of 2016, you were also talking to Mr. Cohen about Mark Cuban, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And Mr. Cohen was looking at potentially working with Mr. Cuban, right?

David Pecker: That's what Michael Cohen told me.

Emil Bove: And he actually asked you for a little bit of help around that, right?

David Pecker: Yes, he did.

Emil Bove: He asked you, did he not, to send paparazzi to photograph the meeting between Cohen and Cuban, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And he made that request because he said that would put pressure on President Trump to treat Cohen differently, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And you agreed to help him do that, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: To put a little pressure through the National Enquirer on President Trump, correct?

David Pecker: I wasn't -- no, that's not correct.

Emil Bove: You understood that the natural consequence of that publication would be to put a little pressure on him, right?

David Pecker: Michael Cohen never said that to me.

Emil Bove: My question is whether you understood that publishing photographs like that, even if it wasn't going to be harmful, could put a little pressure on President Trump, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And, Mr. Bernik, could we take a look at People's 156 in evidence.

Note: [Displayed]

Emil Bove: And this is the Agreement between AMI and Ms. McDougal from August of 2016, right?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Emil Bove: And this Agreement looks a little bit different in terms of formatting from the one with Mr. Sajudin, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And, Mr. Bernik, can you please zoom in on Paragraph 3.

Note: [Displayed]

Emil Bove: And you were asked some questions by Mr. Steinglass about this provision of the Agreement, right? Do you remember that?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And I think that one of the questions was whether this document was set up so that it would disguise the other provisions in the Agreement. Do you remember that question?

David Pecker: Yes, I do.

Emil Bove: And I think you said: "Yes, this paragraph was designed to disguise the other paragraphs," right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: But there were actually very real paragraphs in this agreement, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And you can zoom back out, please, Mr. Bernik.

Emil Bove: Very real obligations for AMI, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And, in fact, you told the Federal Prosecutors that you believed it was critically important to follow the words of the McDougal Agreement because you did not want any illegal or campaign violations that would open the door to legal action by McDougal?

Joshua Steinglass: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Emil Bove: You told the Federal Prosecutors that the other provisions of this agreement mattered, right?

David Pecker: Yes, I did.

Emil Bove: And it created real obligations by AMI, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And you didn't tell the Federal Prosecutors that this was a disguise, correct?

Joshua Steinglass: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Emil Bove: Mr. Bernik, could you please zoom in on Paragraph 1.

Note: [Displayed]

Emil Bove: And, so, do you see at the start of this paragraph, there is a reference to two years from the effective date?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And, so, that's basically a 24-month period on this part of the Agreement?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Emil Bove: And AMI purchased the rights to use Ms. McDougal's name and likeness in 24 columns in Star Magazine, if I have that right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And you also purchased the rights for 24 columns using Ms. McDougal's name and likeness in OK! Magazine, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: Four posts per month in Radar Online?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: That's 96 columns over two years, right?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Emil Bove: And if you could zoom in, please, now on Paragraph 2.

Note: [Displayed]

Emil Bove: This relates to magazine covers, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And so these are other things that AMI purchased from Ms. McDougal in connection with this agreement, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And these were real obligations on the part of AMI, correct?

David Pecker: Yes, they were.

Emil Bove: And in exchange for all of these things, the columns, the block posts, the magazine covers, and the story rights, AMI agreed to pay Ms. McDougal $150,000, right?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Emil Bove: But during the negotiations, Ms. McDougal was not focused on cash, was she?

David Pecker: I'm sorry, could you repeat that again.

Emil Bove: Ms. McDougal was not focused on cash during the negotiations, correct?

David Pecker: Not focused on?

Emil Bove: Cash. Money. Not focused on --

David Pecker: Money? The cash amount wasn't a primary portion of the Agreement.

Emil Bove: What Ms. McDougal was to focus on was the provisions in Paragraphs 1 and 2, right?

David Pecker: Oh, for her, yes.

Emil Bove: Because, as you said earlier this morning, she was looking to restart her career, is that correct?

David Pecker: Yes, that's right.

Emil Bove: And she had started part of her career with then Men's Fitness, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And which was part of, at this point, in 2016, an AMI publication, right?

David Pecker: That's right.

Emil Bove: And you, at that point, viewed AMI as making a good relaunching point for Ms. McDougal, correct?

David Pecker: It was all part of this Agreement.

Emil Bove: And there was actually a video conference, a presentation to Ms. McDougal about the types of things that AMI could do for her, correct?

David Pecker: It was a video conference, correct.

Emil Bove: And during that video conference, the presentation touched on the promotion -- the promotional opportunities that Ms. McDougal was looking for, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And that was in the end of June of 2016, right?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Emil Bove: And during that video conference, there was no discussion of a monetary payment, correct?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Emil Bove: And AMI told Ms. McDougal that her promotion in AMI magazines would be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And nobody was lying to her, right?

David Pecker: No.

Emil Bove: And, in fact, AMI's publications ended up running more than 65 stories in Ms. McDougal's name, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: When AMI signed this agreement, the one that's on the screen, you believed it had a legitimate business purpose, correct?

David Pecker: I did.

Emil Bove: You can take that down. Thank you. Can we now take a look at People's 158, which is in evidence.

Note: [Displayed]

Emil Bove: Do you recall talking to Mr. Steinglass about this document yesterday?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And I think you said that this is an invoice from Keith Davidson, right?

David Pecker: I did.

Emil Bove: This is actually AMI's record relating to the invoice, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And so it's not the invoice itself?

David Pecker: It's an AMI record as you said, that's correct.

Emil Bove: Reflecting whatever Mr. Davidson's invoice said, right?

David Pecker: Yes, that's correct.

Emil Bove: And AMI had employees who created a record like this when it got an invoice, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And as far as you understood it, the standard operating procedure was for the employee to take the information from the invoice and put it in the system?

David Pecker: That is correct.

Emil Bove: And, Mr. Bernik, if we could zoom in on the bottom row, please.

Note: [Displayed]

Emil Bove: Do you see that, the headers on these columns: Account, Department, and Operating Unit?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: There were people at AMI and the accounting department who completed that information, right?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Emil Bove: And they did that based on whatever invoice Mr. Davidson sent, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: You didn't put those codes yourself?

David Pecker: No, I did not.

Emil Bove: You trusted people to do it accurately, right?

David Pecker: I did.

Emil Bove: And that was AMI's standard operating procedure?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: Mr. Bernik, can we please take a look at Government Exhibit 159, which is also in evidence.

Note: [Displayed]

Emil Bove: You testified about this one yesterday also?

David Pecker: I did.

Emil Bove: And I think you said that it is a general ledger detail for the $150,000 transaction with Mr. Davidson?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Emil Bove: And, basically, the data from the document that we just looked at, People's 158, feeds into a general ledger entry like this, right?

David Pecker: Yes, that's correct.

Emil Bove: And that's an automated process, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: Based on information that Mr. Davidson provided, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And that you trusted your accounting people to input, correct?

David Pecker: I did.

Emil Bove: If we could zoom in on the right side of this so that we can catch the date column, please.

Note: [Displayed]

Emil Bove: It's a little blurry there, but do you see the column heading that says "Date Due"?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And I think -- I think there is an 8/9/2018 after that. Do you see that?

David Pecker: That is correct.

Emil Bove: And you were asked some questions about this yesterday, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And it wasn't clear to you from this document whether that -- this was the date of the invoice or the payment, right?

David Pecker: Yes, that's correct.

Emil Bove: Because those are the types of details that are hard to keep track of for someone at your level, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And you had a whole department who was focused on keeping track of those details?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Emil Bove: They had standard operating procedures, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And you trusted their work?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: Can we take a look at People's Exhibit 160, please.

Note: [Displayed]

Emil Bove: I'm sorry. I think it's 161.

Note: [Displayed]

Emil Bove: Let me correct myself for one minute. It's my fault. People's Exhibit 160, Page 2.

Emil Bove: You remember this from yesterday, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And there is some handwriting on this document. Do you see that?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And you testified that one of the people who approved this voucher was Chris Polimeni?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: He was AMI's CFO at the time?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Emil Bove: And, Mr. Bernik, can you zoom in on the bottom third of the document.

Note: [Displayed]

Emil Bove: There are some other approval signatures here, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: It looks like there is a signature by a Controller, with the last name "Brady." Do you know who that is?

David Pecker: That's Stephanie Brady, yes.

Emil Bove: And then to the left of that there is a signature, "AP Approver." Do you know who that is?

David Pecker: I think that's LR. That's Liz Ruotolo.

Emil Bove: So there are people at AMI you trusted to process records, right, like this, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: To review and approve them, right? Correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And you were comfortable that they were following procedures in 2016, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And there are no false entries in any of these records, are there?

David Pecker: No.

Emil Bove: You can take that down, please.

Emil Bove: And if we go back now to People's 156 in evidence. This is the agreement with Ms. McDougal.

Note: [Displayed]

Emil Bove: You testified that you consulted a campaign attorney about this agreement, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And you also said that you consulted AMI's general counsel, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And I think you testified on direct that you told Michael Cohen the agreement was, quote, "Bulletproof?"

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And that is a term that you used to convey that there is no legal ramifications, right?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Emil Bove: That's what you said when -- that's what you meant when you said "Bulletproof" to Mr. Cohen?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And I would like to take a look at the trial transcript.

Emil Bove: And this is for everybody, please, Mr. Bernik. Page 1128, lines 1 through 18.

Note: [Displayed]

Emil Bove: And if you can take a look at that, Mr. Pecker, and let me know when you are done, please.

David Pecker: I'm done.

Emil Bove: And, so, do you see the questions beginning at Line 12? And I will read it: "And was that all the campaign attorney reviewed, as far as you know?" Do you see that?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And you said: "As far as I know, yes." And I just want to make sure that I understand the -- what's being said here. Is it your testimony that you withheld information from the attorneys providing advice about the Agreement?

David Pecker: No. I did not withhold information on the Agreement.

Emil Bove: And so you didn't do anything inappropriate when you consulted counsel relating to the Agreement with Karen McDougal, did you?

David Pecker: No. I did not.

Emil Bove: And when you told Mr. Cohen that the Agreement was "Bulletproof," you meant it, right?

David Pecker: Yes, I did.

Emil Bove: Because you had legal advice?

David Pecker: Right.

Emil Bove: We can take that down. Thanks.

Emil Bove: Now, you said that Karen McDougal had an attorney in connection with the negotiations with AMI, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: Keith Davidson, if I have it right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And Mr. Davidson was one of the major sources for Dylan Howard also, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And so he was an attorney for Ms. McDougal, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: But at the same time providing information directly to Mr. Howard, if I have that right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And was that a normal structure in AMI's source networks to use attorneys as sources of information about their clients?

David Pecker: I would say that this was a unique situation.

Emil Bove: Mr. Davidson was a unique situation, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And you are a sophisticated guy, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: We can agree, you've had lawyers before, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: We just talked about some of them, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And you had lawyers and you had meetings with the Government, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And you also worked with lawyers in situations that were less stressful?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: On deals when you were making money, right?

David Pecker: Right.

Emil Bove: And, generally speaking, you expected your lawyers not to provide information to third parties about what you discussed with them, correct?

Joshua Steinglass: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Emil Bove: You expected confidentiality from your attorneys, correct?

Joshua Steinglass: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Emil Bove: So you said that Mr. Davidson was the only situation that AMI had where there was an attorney being used as a source, right?

David Pecker: Not the only one. I don't know of other ones, but I'm sure there have been.

Emil Bove: So you don't know if there were any others, other than Mr. Davidson?

David Pecker: The only one that I know of was -- is Mr. Davidson.

Emil Bove: Mr. Davidson knew Michael Cohen too, right?

David Pecker: I found out that, yes, he did. I subsequently found that out afterwards.

Emil Bove: When you say "afterwards," when did you learn that?

David Pecker: It was probably right, previously before we signed the Karen McDougal Agreement. So probably it was around August 5th or 6th.

Emil Bove: How did --

David Pecker: The Agreement was signed in June.

Emil Bove: I'm sorry?

David Pecker: No, I'm saying the first time I heard -- I heard Keith Davidson's name was June 20th. The time -- to answer your question, the time that I heard about that he knew Michael Cohen, I didn't know that until around the end of July or early August.

Emil Bove: So, in June 2016, you learned that Dylan Howard was using an attorney as a major source of information for National Enquirer articles, correct?

David Pecker: I wouldn't classify him as a major attorney.

Emil Bove: Exactly. What I am getting at is whether Mr. Davidson was a major source for Dylan Howard?

David Pecker: We had hundreds of sources. He was one of many.

Emil Bove: You recall testifying in the Grand Jury with the District Attorney, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: That was in 2023, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And just like in the Federal Grand Jury, you were under oath, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: There was a court reporter there taking down your questions and your answers, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And do you recall describing during your testimony Mr. Davidson as one of your two major sources?

David Pecker: One of two major sources for Dylan Howard.

Emil Bove: So --

David Pecker: Not -- and Dylan Howard is one editor of fifty -- he's the Editor-in-Chief, but there are fifty several other -- let me put it this way, several other editors all have their own sources. I don't know, when you take it down to those levels, that how many of them were attorneys, how many of them -- how many times have they used that, you -- I don't know that, I only heard that from Dylan.

Emil Bove: I understand --

David Pecker: And that's what I was answering to.

Emil Bove: I appreciate the clarification, and I think that's fair. I'm not trying to stretch it.

David Pecker: No, no, no. I'm just trying to explain it.

Emil Bove: I appreciate that. And so Davidson was one of Dylan Howard's major sources, that's my point?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Emil Bove: And he was also friends with Cohen, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And you didn't learn that, that Cohen-Davidson connection until right before the Agreement was signed, right?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Emil Bove: And you don't know what Cohen and Davidson were working on the side, do you?

David Pecker: I don't.

Emil Bove: Can we take a look at People's 161 in evidence, please.

Note: [Displayed]

Emil Bove: This is that invoice that we've looked at a couple of times, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And this is not an AMI record, is it?

David Pecker: No, it's not.

Emil Bove: And do you recall some questions on Tuesday about a thumb drive?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: Mr. Steinglass brought you a thumb drive and he asked you questions about documents on the thumb drive, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And you said: "There are documents on this drive that I've reviewed," correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And you said that these were all AMI records, correct?

Joshua Steinglass: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Emil Bove: You testified on Tuesday that each document on the thumb drive was -- it was part of the business of AMI to make and keep these records, right?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Emil Bove: And that was a mistake with respect to this one, right?

Joshua Steinglass: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Emil Bove: You just said this is not an AMI record, correct?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Emil Bove: This is one of the documents that Mr. Rotstein prepared, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And he was not an employee when he prepared the invoice, right?

David Pecker: No.

Emil Bove: And do you remember testifying yesterday that you saw this document around the time that it was prepared?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And that was a mistake too, right?

David Pecker: Can you clarify that?

Emil Bove: You didn't actually see this document in 2016, did you?

David Pecker: I saw the document when it -- when Rotstein was sending it over for the billing to Cohen.

Emil Bove: In 2016?

David Pecker: I signed the -- I signed the original Agreement and then, subsequently, the invoice was sent over so I would have seen the invoice.

Emil Bove: Do you remember having a meeting in 2019 with the District Attorney's office?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: It was a long meeting, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: There were many questions, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And there were many Prosecutors, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: It was a full room that day, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: You had your lawyers there too, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And on the Prosecution side, do you remember that somebody was typing?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: Maybe more than one person, right?

David Pecker: I don't remember that. I remember one person.

Emil Bove: One person was typing a lot, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: Do you recall that during that meeting, you told the Prosecutors that: "The first time I saw this document was probably in 2017 when we were going through the document production for SDNY." Do you recall that?

David Pecker: Can I trouble you? Could I see that?

Emil Bove: Yes.

Emil Bove: Mr. Bernik, this is for the parties, Mr. Pecker and the Court, please. Defense A108.

Emil Bove: And, so, I want to start just by orienting you to look at the top, just the date and the participants.

David Pecker: Yes. I can see the top. I reviewed the top.

Emil Bove: And, now, if we could go to the page with Bates ending 061.

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And zoom in on the top half, please.

Note: [Displayed]

Emil Bove: And do you see the question says: "Why was it called a flat fee for advisory services by somebody named Walsh?"

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And so that's a phrase from the invoice, right?

David Pecker: Yes, it is.

Emil Bove: And so at this part of the meeting you're being asked about the invoice, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And do you see at the top of the page where you said: "No, not in 2016. First time I saw this document was probably in 2017, when we were going through the document production for SDNY?"

David Pecker: Well, now seeing this, I clarified it too. This statement is correct.

Emil Bove: The statement in 2019 is correct?

David Pecker: The statement in 2019 is correct.

Emil Bove: Thank you.

David Pecker: That was the first time.

Emil Bove: And just so the record is clear, the mistake that was made is that you testified yesterday that you saw the invoice in 2016, right?

David Pecker: Yes. I made an error. I would have seen it when -- what it says here.

Emil Bove: We can take that down, please. And if we could bring up People's 180 in evidence.

Note: [Displayed]

Emil Bove: And I'm -- this is the Wall Street Journal article that we looked at earlier, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And it relates to Ms. McDougal, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And this is the one that came out before the election, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And this article, it contains information about your Agreement with Ms. McDougal, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: As well as information about the story that she had told Dylan Howard, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: It contains details about both of those issues, the Agreement and the story?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Emil Bove: And I think you testified yesterday that there was some concerns about whether Ms. McDougal violated her Agreement with AMI based on this article?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And you asked Dylan Howard to follow up with Keith Davidson, right?

David Pecker: I did.

Emil Bove: And there was some text messages about that, do you remember?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And do you remember that in the text messages Howard reported back that Ms. McDougal was cool and moving forward with the deal?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And, so, as far as you knew, she didn't have any concerns about the content of her Agreement with AMI prior to the election, right?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Emil Bove: And that's what her attorney and Mr. Howard's source, Keith Davidson, were reporting to you, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And this information, the Agreement, AMI's Agreement, and the underlying details that Ms. McDougal told to Dylan Howard were made public prior to the election?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: We can take this down, please.

Emil Bove: You also were asked some questions by Mr. Steinglass about Stormy Daniels. Do you remember those questions?

David Pecker: Yes. I was asked some questions.

Emil Bove: And you testified that the first time that you heard about a potential article of Stormy Daniels was October 2016, right?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Emil Bove: And you said that there was a phone call from Dylan Howard when he learned that?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And I think you said you had dinner with your wife that night?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Emil Bove: And you told Mr. Howard that you wanted no involvement with the story, correct?

David Pecker: That is correct.

Emil Bove: And what you meant when you said: "No involvement with the story" is I don't want AMI to be a part of this, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And you did not consider the Stormy Daniels story to be a part of any Agreement that you had in August 2015, correct?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Emil Bove: You wanted nothing to do with it, right?

David Pecker: That's right.

Emil Bove: And when you said that to Mr. Howard, you were still the Chairman of AMI, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And the CEO, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And the President, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And you were speaking for the company, and for yourself?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And a few weeks later, Mr. Howard told you that Ms. Daniels had not been paid, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And it's true, isn't it, that Keith Davidson is in the middle once again?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: Mr. Howard was using an attorney as a source, who was providing information from his client to the National Enquirer -- well, to Dylan Howard?

David Pecker: To Dylan Howard, that's correct.

Emil Bove: Not to AMI, because you had not authorized Dylan Howard to be speaking with Davidson, correct?

Joshua Steinglass: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Emil Bove: I will break that up. You did not authorize Dylan Howard to speak to Keith Davidson about Stormy Daniels, correct?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Emil Bove: So anything that Dylan Howard was doing with respect to Stormy Daniels was unauthorized and outside of his employment?

Joshua Steinglass: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Emil Bove: When Mr. Howard came back to you on the Stormy Daniels story, what he said was Michael Cohen has not paid Keith Davidson, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And you were surprised to hear that?

David Pecker: I was.

Emil Bove: Surprised because you had told Howard to stay out of it, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And, frankly, you were not happy to be hearing that, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And, at that point, when Howard contacted you about this payment, the main concern was Howard's reputation, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: The concern was that Dylan Howard would look bad if this payment wasn't made, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And he said that to you, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: He said: "It can't be that in this industry somebody promises to pay one of my sources and that doesn't happen, I look bad?"

David Pecker: That is correct.

Emil Bove: And so you and Howard called Mr. Cohen, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And you said to Mr. Cohen: "I want you to know, I'm not paying or doing anything on this," right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And you meant it?

David Pecker: I did.

Emil Bove: AMI was not going to do anything on the Stormy Daniels story, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: You testified, I think, yesterday, about a meeting on January 6th, 2017.

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And I think you said that that meeting happened at Trump Tower, right?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Emil Bove: And I think you said that the way that the -- the reason that that dates sticks out to you is that there was a very violent incident that day, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: At the Fort Lauderdale Airport?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: I think five people died that day?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And then, obviously, there was a lot of coverage of that, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And, so, in your memory, you sort of pegged it, the date of that meeting to that incident, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And I think you said that on that day, January 6th, 2017, you were let into President Trump's office?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: By Ms. Graff, Rhona Graff?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And that when you walked in, President Trump was sitting at his desk, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And there was some people gathered around him, right?

David Pecker: Correct.

Emil Bove: And what he said was -- they were discussing the Fort Lauderdale shooting, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And you heard some of that conversation, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And some of the people who were -- who you said were there that day, Reince Priebus?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: He had been named the White House Chief of Staff in about November of 2016, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And you testified you saw Mike Pompeo standing around President Trump's desk that day, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And he had been named his Secretary of State once President Trump took office, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And you testified that you saw Sean Spicer, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And he became President Trump's Press Secretary, right?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Emil Bove: And you said that you saw James Comey, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: Who, at that time, was the FBI Director, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And so I just want to make sure that I understand the picture that you have of the meeting, everybody that I described as standing around President Trump's desk?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: President Trump is seated?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And Ms. Graff led you into an ongoing discussion of a national -- of a domestic national security incident?

David Pecker: I was in the -- when you -- when -- Mr. Trump has a large office, and I was by the door while they were discussing -- they were talking to Mr. Trump.

Emil Bove: But you overheard some of the conversation, you said?

David Pecker: I didn't hear the words, but I heard just that the people were talking.

Emil Bove: And I think you said that there was a sort of a joke made by President Trump about you knowing more about the Fort Lauderdale situation than the other people in the room?

David Pecker: I don't think he was referring to Fort Lauderdale, it was a joke just saying that I knew more about all of -- about information, that's all he was referring to as a joke.

Emil Bove: Okay. And you know that following that meeting, there were some issues between President Trump and Jim Comey, right?

Joshua Steinglass: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Emil Bove: Your Honor, can we have a sidebar, please?

Juan Merchan: Sure.

Juan Merchan: I want to hear what the objection is.

Joshua Steinglass: I'm finding it hard to see what the relevance is.

Emil Bove: I want to lay a foundation so I can ask -- can we do this out of the presence of the witness, Judge?

Juan Merchan: Is it possible to slide over this way?

Court Reporter: Yes, your Honor.

Emil Bove: I intend to lay a foundation, Judge, that Mr. Pecker was well aware of events surrounding Mr. Comey. He was well aware of the subsequent investigations at issue and that connection with this investigation, Mr. Comey made emphatically clear that on January 26th, 2017, was at Trump Tower with a classified briefing in an individual meeting in a conference room and not at his desk and that there was a very intense conversation.

Emil Bove: And the point of that cross is to illustrate that the witness has misremembered what he saw that day when he talked about Jim Comey, because there was nothing to talk about regarding Fort Lauderdale.

Juan Merchan: That's an awful lot of information to bring out just to get to the point that he misremembered something.

Emil Bove: This witness is a critical witness, and his memory --

Juan Merchan: I think you are doing a good job with his memory. I don't think you need to go there.

Juan Merchan: The objection is sustained.

Emil Bove: Mr. Bernik, can we just take a look at Page 1213 of the transcript.

Note: [Displayed]

Emil Bove: And --

Emil Bove: Thank you. Can you please zoom in. I think it's lines 21 through 24.

Note: [Displayed]

Emil Bove: And, Mr. Pecker, this is testimony that you gave of --

Joshua Steinglass: Objection, Judge. I think this is being displayed -- this is the transcript being displayed to the jury here.

Juan Merchan: Can you take that down, please. Please approach.

Juan Merchan: All right.

Emil Bove: I don't mean to run afoul of your rules, I have done that this morning already.

Juan Merchan: You did do that this morning already. I found it really unusual. There was no objection, so I allowed it, but there is an objection now.

Emil Bove: This is evidence, Judge. This is the transcript. Why can't I receive it in and display it?

Juan Merchan: Why can't you just asked the question.

Emil Bove: But I want to make my point.

Juan Merchan: Just ask the question. If he doesn't remember, then you can put that up, all right.

Emil Bove: All right. I understand.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Emil Bove: So you recall being asked some questions about this meeting yesterday by Mr. Steinglass, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And when I say "this meeting," I mean the meeting on January 6th of 2017, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And do you recall that you testified that President Trump said to you: "I want to thank you for handling the McDougal situation." Do you recall that?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And you said that yesterday, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And do you recall testifying -- and then you said: "This is referring to President Trump," right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: Quote, "I want to -- he also said, I want to thank you for the doorman story, the doorman situation," right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: Do you recall saying that yesterday?

David Pecker: I did.

Emil Bove: Was that another mistake?

David Pecker: No.

Emil Bove: And so do you believe that President Trump said that to you, as you sit here right now?

David Pecker: Yes, I do.

Emil Bove: We talked a couple of times about meetings you had with Federal Prosecutors on July 26th, 2018, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And we talked about the circumstances, there were Federal Prosecutors and FBI Agents, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And they told you it was important to tell the truth, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And you understood that not telling the truth could be a crime, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: It was serious business, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And you certainly did your best to tell the truth in 2018 about the January 6th, 2017 meeting and everything else, right?

David Pecker: Yes, that's correct?

Emil Bove: And do you recall saying during that meeting: "Trump did not express any gratitude to Pecker or AMI during the conversation on January 6th, 2017?"

David Pecker: I don't recall.

Emil Bove: Mr. Bernik, if we could bring up for Mr. Pecker, the parties, and the Court Defense Exhibit A101.

Note: [Displayed]

Emil Bove: And just to get oriented, I would like you to look at the bottom paragraph and under the date, investigation.

Emil Bove: Were you able to take a look? I just want to make clear that this is the report of the meeting that we were just talking about?

David Pecker: This is -- I'm sorry, can you clarify what this is again.

Emil Bove: If you look at the bottom, you see the date July 26th, 2018.

David Pecker: I see July 31st there, at the bottom.

Emil Bove: That's on the right side. Do you see that's "date drafted." On the left side you see "investigation on?"

David Pecker: Oh. July 26th.

Emil Bove: And that was the date of the interview, right?

David Pecker: This is the interview.

Emil Bove: And this is the interview, you see your name in the top left?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And do you recognize that address as the Federal Prosecutor's address?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And so if you take a look at Page 20 of Defense Exhibit A101, please.

Emil Bove: And zoom in on the top half when you get there.

Note: [Displayed]

Emil Bove: And so you were -- this is -- well, take a look and let me know when you've had a chance to read it.

Emil Bove: Did you have a chance to look at it?

David Pecker: You wanted to know if this is the meeting? Is that what you were saying?

Emil Bove: Right. If you look at the top paragraph, you see that this is a portion of the interview where you were discussing that January 6th, 2017 meeting, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And take a look at the last paragraph on the screen. Do you see that?

Emil Bove: And so I want to direct your attention to the paragraph that says "Trump then asked Pecker." Do you see that?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And do you see the last sentence of that paragraph?

David Pecker: Now?

Emil Bove: Yes?

David Pecker: I was just saying, this is the FBI's interview, is that correct? Is that what this is?

Emil Bove: This is the same document that -- the first page I just showed you, the report of the July 26th, 2018 interview by Federal Prosecutors and the FBI, right?

David Pecker: So the FBI -- these are the FBI notes?

Emil Bove: Yes.

David Pecker: Yes. So the FBI notes here -- what somebody is writing down could be wrong. This is not -- I know what I testified to.

Emil Bove: Yesterday?

David Pecker: Yesterday.

Emil Bove: Uh-huh.

David Pecker: And I know what I remember. This is going back to 2018. I didn't recall back from -- what I'm saying here is that -- -- during the FBI investigation, I know what I said yesterday happened, so I can't reconcile what the FBI interview was -- if someone made a mistake or not.

Emil Bove: So you can't reconcile because what you said yesterday is inconsistent with what's in this report, correct?

David Pecker: Yes, but I wouldn't be responsible for this report.

Emil Bove: I understand. And so are you suggesting that the FBI made a mistake here?

David Pecker: I know what the truth is. I'm not -- I can't state what the -- what's here, why this was written this way. I know exactly what was said to me.

Emil Bove: And so your testimony yesterday is inconsistent with what's written there?

Joshua Steinglass: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Overruled.

David Pecker: Can you repeat what you want -- what you asked me again? I'm sorry.

Emil Bove: I'm just trying to make sure that I understand it. And I'm not trying to put you on the spot.

Juan Merchan: Maybe if you could rephrase the question.

Emil Bove: Yes.

Emil Bove: Your testimony yesterday is inconsistent with what's written in that report, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: Judge, I have a couple more topics. I don't know if there is a mid morning break planned.

Juan Merchan: Sure. All right. Jurors, let's go ahead and take our mid morning recess. I will see you in about 15 minutes. Can you step out.

Court Officer: Leave your note pads on the chairs. All rise.

Juan Merchan: Thank you. Please have a seat. Mr. Pecker, you may step down and take a recess too.

Juan Merchan: Mr. Bove, I'm not trying to rush you, but I just want to get a sense of where we stand?

Emil Bove: Thank you, Judge. I appreciate that. I think I have less than an hour left, that's my best guess.

Juan Merchan: And I imagine that there would be redirect after that?

Joshua Steinglass: I imagine.

Juan Merchan: All right. I will see you all in a few minutes.

Joshua Steinglass: Thank you.

Note: [Recess taken, after which time Senior Court Reporter Susan Pearce-Bates relieved Senior Court Reporter Lisa Kramsky.]

Court Clerk: Continued case on trial, People versus Donald J. Trump. Parties are present.

Juan Merchan: Let's get the witness, please.

Juan Merchan: Please be seated.

Court Clerk: Case on trial continued, People versus Donald J. Trump. All parties and jurors are present.

Juan Merchan: Mr. Bove.

Emil Bove: Thank you, Judge.

Emil Bove: Mr. Pecker, I think you testified yesterday that in early 2018 FBI agents came to you?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: Can you describe what happened?

David Pecker: They came to my home. It was April 9th of 2018, and they gave me a search warrant, and they took my phone.

Emil Bove: What time did they come?

David Pecker: Around, I think was it like 8:00 in the morning.

Emil Bove: How many agents?

David Pecker: There was three.

Emil Bove: And you said they searched your house?

David Pecker: No.

Emil Bove: Just your phone?

David Pecker: Yes, just my phone.

Emil Bove: How many times did you meet with the agents after that?

David Pecker: I don't remember the exact number of times.

Emil Bove: But more than once, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And these were stressful meetings, right?

David Pecker: I was with my attorneys. I felt good.

Emil Bove: You wanted it over with though, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And eventually AMI entered into a Non-Prosecution Agreement with the Federal, correct?

David Pecker: Yes, they did.

Emil Bove: And you testified a little bit about that yesterday, right?

David Pecker: I did.

Emil Bove: Mr. Bernik, if we can please bring up People's 182 which is in evidence. This is the Non-Prosecution Agreement, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: You see the date at the top? Could you zoom in, please? It is not a vision test. Thank you.

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: September 20, 2018, right?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Emil Bove: And at the time that AMI entered into this agreement, there were negotiations going on related to some of AMI's assets, correct?

David Pecker: Can you clarify that?

Emil Bove: You know who the Hudson News Group is, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And you are part of that group, right?

David Pecker: I am not part of that group, no.

Emil Bove: Can you describe the transaction, please?

David Pecker: You just have to clarify. You asked me if I was part of Hudson News Group. No, I am not.

Emil Bove: I understand your answer. You are familiar that there was a transaction with the Hudson News Group?

David Pecker: There was a proposed transaction with the Hudson News Group to acquire the name -- to acquire the National Enquirer and the other two tabloids.

Emil Bove: There was a proposed deal, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: At the time of that proposed deal you were still an AMI executive, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And just to clarify, when I say, at the time of the proposed deal, I mean in September of 2018. Do I have that date, right?

David Pecker: I don't remember the exact date that we were negotiating or that we had a proposed transaction with Hudson News.

Emil Bove: Do you recall that you told the District Attorney's Office that the funds on that deal were in escrow at the time this agreement was entered into?

David Pecker: That was in the -- that was -- the conversations with the District Attorney was in 2018.

Emil Bove: One of them, correct, the meeting where we looked at the notes before the break, right?

David Pecker: I was saying 2019 we had the meeting, yes.

Emil Bove: And during that meeting, you told the District Attorney's Office that when this agreement was signed, the funds were in escrow?

David Pecker: For -- at 2018? I am a little bit confused here about the years.

Emil Bove: Let me ask it this way, were the funds in escrow at the time this agreement was signed?

David Pecker: No.

Emil Bove: Were there negotiations ongoing?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And the deal was worth about a hundred million dollars, right?

David Pecker: That was the proposed deal.

Emil Bove: And you knew that to consummate that deal, to finalize it, you had to clear up the investigation, correct?

David Pecker: Yes. Yes, that's correct.

Emil Bove: And that was ultimately written into the deal papers, that the investigations had to be resolved before the hundred million, approximately, could be taken out of escrow and a transaction finalized, correct?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Emil Bove: So, in addition to the unpleasantness of sitting with the FBI, that put some pressure on the negotiations, right?

Joshua Steinglass: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Overruled. You can answer.

David Pecker: From the timing standpoint, it would have added on to the -- to the stress of the transaction.

Emil Bove: Meaning, if I understood it right, that the Federal investigation had to get resolved before the deal could go through, correct?

David Pecker: The -- the reason why I am thinking is because the transaction could have closed subject to the investigation being completed.

Emil Bove: The transaction could close subject to the investigation being completed, and at that point, the funds removed from escrow, right?

David Pecker: It would have closed.

Emil Bove: You said that it created a timing dimension to AMI's negotiations with the Federal government?

David Pecker: It didn't have to. There was no pressure about finalizing the agreement, this agreement and the transaction, other than the transaction was subject to when the deal was going to be finalized. There was no drop dead date is what I am saying, that it had to be done by a certain time.

Emil Bove: Understood. And it created a little pressure on the negotiations, correct?

David Pecker: Price -- it wasn't a -- there wasn't price pressure on it.

Emil Bove: Well, AMI's assets are worth less to Hudson News Group if AMI is subject to a Federal investigation, correct?

David Pecker: To Hudson News it was -- the Federal investigation is not going to reduce the earnings of the company, the earnings of those magazines.

Emil Bove: If that investigation is resolved in a way that's favorable to AMI, right?

David Pecker: I would say just resolved.

Emil Bove: But if AMI had been indicted, that would have affected the value of its assets, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And Hudson News Group certainly would want to know if AMI was going to be indicted, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: Indicted means charged, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And AMI wasn't charged, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: Now, I think that yesterday you described this agreement as a Non-Prosecution Agreement, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And when you used those terms, you meant there was no prosecution, right?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Emil Bove: And there are no charges in this agreement, correct?

David Pecker: No.

Emil Bove: And this is the whole agreement, right, between AMI and the Federal government?

Joshua Steinglass: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Overruled. If you know. You can answer if you know.

David Pecker: Thank you. Yes.

Emil Bove: And do you recall testifying yesterday that, we admitted to a campaign violation, do you remember saying that?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And that was just another mistake, right?

Joshua Steinglass: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Emil Bove: That wasn't accurate, correct?

Juan Merchan: You can answer.

David Pecker: Can you repeat the question, again, please?

Emil Bove: I am going to back up on it. So you testified yesterday, did you not, we admitted to a campaign violation?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And when you said that yesterday, you were referring to this agreement, weren't you?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And this agreement is the entire agreement between AMI and the Federal government, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And there is no violation in this agreement, correct?

David Pecker: In this agreement, no.

Emil Bove: That's why it's called a Non-Prosecution Agreement, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: Because if everybody does what they are supposed to do under this agreement, nobody is getting prosecuted?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And, Mr. Bernik, if we can zoom in on the first full paragraph, please, and highlight the phrase, will not criminally prosecute American Media Inc. Do you see that, Mr. Pecker?

David Pecker: Yes, I do.

Emil Bove: And you were the Chairman and CEO and President of AMI at the time this agreement was executed, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And this is the main benefit to the AMI agreement, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: The Federal government will not prosecute AMI, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: So there is no admission in this agreement of any kind of campaign violation by AMI, right?

Joshua Steinglass: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Overruled. If you know. You can answer if you know.

David Pecker: Could you repeat that again?

Emil Bove: Yes. There is no admission by AMI in this agreement of a campaign violation, correct?

David Pecker: No.

Emil Bove: And if we can zoom out, please, Mr. Bernik. Mr. Pecker, just to be clear, you were on the Board of Directors at the time this agreement was signed?

David Pecker: Yes, I was.

Emil Bove: If we can zoom in to the bottom part of the first paragraph. Could you just read that for us, Mr. Pecker?

David Pecker: AMI accepts and acknowledges as true the facts set forth in the statement of facts. Counsel for AMI hereby represents and warrants that the Board of Directors has authorized counsel to enter into this agreement.

Emil Bove: So, as the CEO of AMI, you reviewed this agreement, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And also in your capacity as a member of the Board of Directors you reviewed this agreement, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And I don't want to get into the substance of communications with attorneys, but you consulted attorneys about this agreement, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And you looked at it carefully, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And now, Mr. Bernik, if you can zoom in on the carry-over paragraph on the second page. And so, this language refers to the time period of the agreement, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And so, this agreement is still active, correct?

David Pecker: It was signed in September of '18. So, it -- the agreement was for three years.

Emil Bove: Well, do you see the second entry that, the date on which all prosecutions arising out of the conduct described in the opening paragraph of this agreement are final?

Joshua Steinglass: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Emil Bove: What is your understanding of what that means?

David Pecker: I am not sure I understand what I am being asked.

Emil Bove: My question is, what is your understanding of what the language that's highlighted on the screen means?

David Pecker: Don't I have to look at one first?

Emil Bove: That's fine. Yes, I can hand you a copy.

David Pecker: It says for a period of three years from the start of this agreement. And it says the date on which all prosecutions arising out of the conduct described in the opening paragraph of the agreement are final. I don't understand.

Emil Bove: Do you remember, yesterday, answering questions about the provisions in the U.S. Code by Mr. Steinglass?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And those were hard questions because you weren't sure what those provisions meant, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: I am not going to make this a law school exam either. I am sorry. Let's look at -- Mr. Bernik, if you can zoom in on the next paragraph on the page. Can you read to yourself that first sentence?

David Pecker: That the agreement can be resigned?

Emil Bove: Do you see the phrase, false, incomplete or misleading testimony or information?

David Pecker: Yeah.

Emil Bove: So, basically, this paragraph gives the Federal government some options if they determine that AMI, or its representatives, have given false, incomplete or misleading testimony or information, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: If we can zoom in on the bottom paragraph of this page. So that first sentence refers to the period from the date of the agreement until November 6, 2018. Do you see that?

David Pecker: Yes, I do.

Emil Bove: There was, basically, a period of time where the parties agreed to keep the agreement, to some extent, secret?

David Pecker: Yes, that's correct.

Emil Bove: And the purpose of this provision was to give AMI an opportunity to coordinate credit coverage arising -- relating to the announcement of this agreement, right?

David Pecker: When you say, credit coverage.

Emil Bove: To negotiate with financial institutions.

David Pecker: You -- you mean about notifying them?

Emil Bove: Well, do you remember?

David Pecker: Well, that's the thing. When you -- I am a little confused when you say about credit coverage.

Emil Bove: Let's look to the next page, and please zoom in on the text. Do you see the reference to AMI's underwriters, auditors or insurers for the limited purpose of negotiations regarding credit decisions?

David Pecker: Yes, it was -- it was -- it advised them of the agreement.

Emil Bove: To give AMI an opportunity to protect itself financially when this was announced, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And as CEO of AMI, did that happen? Did AMI make those communications and notifications?

David Pecker: Yes, we did.

Emil Bove: You notified insurers and underwriters, correct?

David Pecker: Yeah.

Emil Bove: And those notifications provided a copy of this agreement, right?

David Pecker: I wouldn't know if the agreement was shared with them.

Emil Bove: But the substance of the agreement was disclosed, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And in connection with those disclosures, it was represented to the financial institutions that the agreement was factually accurate, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: Because you know from your experience that in order for the financial institutions to make credit decisions, they need to have the complete information about the issue, right?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Emil Bove: And so, you testified yesterday about a statement of facts attached to this agreement, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And if we can take a look at the next page, please. And this is that Statement of Facts, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And it was incorporated into the agreement, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: It was something that you approved as the CEO of AMI, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And it was something that, as a member of the Board of Directors, you reviewed and approved as indicated in the agreement itself, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: Can we zoom in on paragraph three, please? Now, you testified earlier this morning about the August 2015 meeting. Do you remember that testimony?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: Do you remember that you confirmed that during the August 2015 meeting there was no discussion on catch and kill, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And during the August 2015 meeting there was no discussion of a financial component to any agreement with President Trump and Michael Cohen, correct?

David Pecker: There was a discussion about that I was going to be the eyes and ears of the campaign. And there was a discussion that I would be notifying Michael Cohen of any women that were in the process of or going to be selling stories. And I would notify Cohen that they would be available, and they would either have to buy them or take them off the market or kill them in some manner.

Emil Bove: Are you testifying now that there was a discussion of the kill agreement?

Joshua Steinglass: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

David Pecker: I said, sell a story.

Emil Bove: I would like to go back for a moment to the October 2019 meeting that we discussed a few times today, the meeting you had at the District Attorney's Office.

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: Do you recall that this provision of the agreement was discussed during that meeting?

David Pecker: The August '15, the August meeting you are saying?

Emil Bove: Let me back up and ask a better question. Do you recall that paragraph three of the agreement that's on the screen was discussed during the October 2019 meeting?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And do you recall that your attorneys told the District Attorney's Office, in your presence --

Joshua Steinglass: Objection, Judge. Objection.

Juan Merchan: Approach.

Note: [Discussion is held at side-bar, on the record.]

Joshua Steinglass: So, he is trying to impeach the witness by what the attorney told the DA's Office. I think that's totally improper.

Emil Bove: Judge, first of all, the attorneys are his agents, speaking in his presence, on his behalf in a meeting. And just the fact that he is aware of what they said on this issue, they said to the District Attorney's Office this provision is inaccurate. So, it's -- in addition, I will lay a foundation that no one reported this to the Federal government.

Emil Bove: That they had taken the position with the District Attorney's Office that the Federal Non-Prosecution Agreement was inaccurate. He has already said that he verified that it was accurate. So, their decision not to inform the Federal authorities conferred a significant benefit to Mr. Pecker. So, on both those grounds these are entirely appropriate.

Emil Bove: It happened in front of the witness. He is aware of --

Juan Merchan: And it is completely admissible.

Joshua Steinglass: I will say two things to that: Number one, it's unbelievably confusing. I am not sure what sense the jury will make of that. Number two, I am not sure what the relevance of this is other than, you know, we have confirmed that the attorney was mistaken in this recollection.

Juan Merchan: The issue, as I am hearing you describe, it is that I am confused. And if I am confused, I imagine that the jury is going to be confused. So, if you can get to this in some other way, I will allow you to, but the way to go about it, I don't think this helps us to get to it.

Emil Bove: What I would ask permission to do, Judge, is finish the question that I was asking, which is whether at the October 2019 meeting his attorneys told the prosecutors that the agreement was inaccurate.

Juan Merchan: And leave it at that.

Emil Bove: No. Then I would confirm that, to his knowledge, that it was never conveyed to the Federal government.

Juan Merchan: You can finish your argument. Go ahead.

Emil Bove: It is a very significant benefit conferred on him by the District Attorney's Office and it's -- and, please, I think you know, this is the first cross-examination as a defense lawyer I have ever done. Please do not hold my shortcomings in the way I am forming questions against President Trump. This is right at the core of what we are doing to impeach Mr. Pecker.

Juan Merchan: Two things: One, you are doing a very good job. Two, that you may be doing a bad job in your opinion is of no consequence. Whoever the defendant is, whatever the position the defendant is running for and whoever represents him, you are all being well-compensated to come here and do a great job. To tell me not to hold it against your youth suggests that I shouldn't enforce the rules of evidence, and I am not going to do that.

Juan Merchan: I will allow you to ask those two questions and that's it. Beyond that, it will just get confusing.

Emil Bove: So I don't overstep, I can ask if he is aware that his attorneys argued in this meeting that the agreement was inaccurate?

Juan Merchan: Now, are you saying that he was there?

Emil Bove: Yes. And I would ask permission, if he doesn't remember, to refresh him.

Juan Merchan: Just ask him, and then follow up with the second question.

Emil Bove: That to his knowledge this was never conveyed to SDNY?

Juan Merchan: Yes, and leave it at that.

Emil Bove: Thank you, Judge.

Note: [Discussion at side-bar concluded, and the following occurred in open court.]

Emil Bove: Thank you. Mr. Pecker, so, before the side-bar, we were talking about the October 2019 meeting, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And I think we can put the Non-Prosecution Agreement back on the screen, please. And I think before the side-bar you said that this provision, paragraph three, was discussed during that meeting, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And your lawyers were there, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: Some of the same lawyers here in the courtroom today, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: During that conversation about paragraph three, do you recall that your attorneys said to the District Attorney's Office that part of paragraph three is, quote, wrong and inaccurate? Do you remember that?

David Pecker: No.

Emil Bove: Mr. Bernik, if we can show just the parties and Mr. Pecker and the Court Defendant's A108. Let's start with the first page just to get oriented. Do you see that these are the notes from October 25th?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And you testified earlier about somebody in the meeting typing everything down, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And if we can now look at the page ending 047.

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And if we zoom in on the first half, please. And I want you to read this, and then let me know when you are done and I have a question or two. And does that refresh your recollection that paragraph three of the Non-Prosecution Agreement was discussed in this meeting?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: You can see that at the top, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And the next entry is a statement by one of your attorneys, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And does that refresh your recollection that the attorney said in response to a question about paragraph three, I think that may be inaccurate. I think that came up with the Feds, I have never heard Pecker say that? Does that refresh your recollection that that was said during the meeting?

David Pecker: No. And I would like to clarify it, if I can.

Emil Bove: Okay.

David Pecker: The only wording here is the word, purchasing, selling stories.

Emil Bove: Meaning?

David Pecker: Meaning my -- the testimony that I gave, and what I said was, I offered at that meeting that being the eyes and ears and hearing any stories that are there, I would offer -- that women would be selling them, and I would be offering them to Michael Cohen. That's what I said. So, the selling here and purchasing, basically, are synonymous.

David Pecker: Somebody has to buy them.

Emil Bove: Does that -- my question is a little more straightforward. I appreciate the clarification. My question is, in response to a question from a prosecutor about the provision in the Non-Prosecution Agreement, did your attorney say, I think that may be inaccurate, I think that came up with the Feds, I have never heard Pecker say that?

Joshua Steinglass: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

David Pecker: Yes.

Juan Merchan: The objection is sustained.

David Pecker: I am sorry.

Emil Bove: There was a dispute in that meeting about some of the language in the agreement, right?

Joshua Steinglass: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Overruled. He can answer.

David Pecker: Yes, it was just the one word.

Emil Bove: We can agree that words are important, right?

David Pecker: Yes, that selling and purchasing is the same. Somebody is selling, somebody has to buy them.

Emil Bove: That's not what your lawyers said to the prosecutors, is it?

Joshua Steinglass: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Emil Bove: And as far as you know, after that October 2019 meeting, the District Attorney's Office did not tell the Federal government that their agreement was inaccurate, correct?

Joshua Steinglass: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Emil Bove: And you testified on Thursday that you received a letter from the Federal Election Commission in 2018?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Emil Bove: And you said that you spoke to Michael Cohen about the letter?

David Pecker: I did.

Emil Bove: And you said that during that conversation Michael Cohen told you that President Trump had Jeff Sessions, quote, in his pocket, do you remember that?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: Are you positive that Michael Cohen said that?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And in thinking back in time to early 2018, you knew that wasn't right?

David Pecker: That's why I said to Michael Cohen, I was very concerned and worried.

Emil Bove: You were concerned because Michael Cohen had said something to you that wasn't true?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Emil Bove: Because President Trump did not have Jeff Sessions in his pocket, correct?

Joshua Steinglass: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Emil Bove: And, in fact, this was an example of one time that came to form your view that Michael Cohen is prone to exaggeration?

Joshua Steinglass: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Overruled. You can answer?

David Pecker: I am sorry. Could you say that again?

Emil Bove: Based on your experience, Michael Cohen is prone to exaggeration?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: You could not trust everything he said?

Joshua Steinglass: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Overruled.

Joshua Steinglass: Could we be heard at sidebar?

Juan Merchan: Sure.

Note: [Discussion is held at side-bar, on the record.]

Joshua Steinglass: Sorry, Judge. I am not trying to be difficult. This is opinion testimony of a witness of the credibility of another witness who hasn't testified yet. That is not proper. To attack a witness' credibility -- a witness' credibility is being attacked for bad acts or reputation for peacefulness, truthfulness in the community by another witness.

Joshua Steinglass: The witness is not permitted to offer his opinion of another witness.

Emil Bove: The witness has been able to testify and give his opinion here today about President Trump's statements or admissions. The statements of Michael Cohen --

Juan Merchan: To the extent that you are asking him his opinion, I am not going to -- you need to move on. If you want to impeach Michael Cohen, that is not the right way to do it. All right?

Emil Bove: Yes, Judge.

Note: [Discussion at side-bar concluded, and the following occurred in open court.]

Emil Bove: You testified yesterday that the FEC investigation actually ended in sort of an agreement with AMI, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And I think you referred to that as a Conciliation Agreement, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And that was entered into in May of 2021, if I am remembering that right?

David Pecker: It was 2021, May or June.

Emil Bove: And you read that Conciliation Agreement at the time it was entered into, correct?

David Pecker: At that time I was not part of the company anymore.

Emil Bove: I understand. You left in 2020, correct?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Emil Bove: You were still interested in this investigation, weren't you?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: Part of that was because you still had equity in AMI, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And you also provided consulting services to AMI?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: What type of consulting services were you providing to AMI in 2021?

David Pecker: Just any questions from the President on the tabloids, on the celebrity magazines and the magazine issues.

Emil Bove: And for those reasons, among others, you reviewed the Conciliation Agreement, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And you testified yesterday, did you not, that the Conciliation Agreement involved an admission by AMI to a campaign violation?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: That wasn't accurate, was it?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: Withdrawn.

David Pecker: Yes, it was.

Emil Bove: Sir, it's -- you reviewed the agreement in 2021. Have you reviewed it more recently?

David Pecker: I re -- I reviewed it in 2021, yes.

Emil Bove: Have you reviewed it more recently?

David Pecker: More recently, yes, I reviewed it.

Emil Bove: In connection with preparing for your testimony, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: Mr. Bernik, if we can take a look at Defense marked for identification A131, please, and turn to page two. This is a Conciliation Agreement, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And if we can look at page seven, please, Mr. Bernik. And I would like to zoom in, if we could, to the paragraph with the Roman numeral entry five, sub one and two.

David Pecker: I have page six of eight.

Emil Bove: We will work on that. I think -- is this A131?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: There we go. Sir, take a look at the language that is zoomed in on the screen. And I want to see if that refreshes your recollection that AMI entered into this agreement with no admission as to the merit of the Commission's -- no admission as to the merit of the Commission's legal conclusions?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: That's different from an admission, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: One of the other reasons that you were following this FEC investigation was that you were actually a party at one point, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And you and AMI had counsel, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And the FEC was also accusing you of a campaign finance violation, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And you certainly did not admit to a campaign finance violation in connection with anything that you described during your testimony, right?

David Pecker: No.

Emil Bove: And that Conciliation Agreement that we just talked about with AMI, you were not part of that, right?

David Pecker: That was the company.

Emil Bove: Right. You didn't work at the company anymore, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And in connection with defending against the FEC allegations, you submitted a Declaration to the FEC, correct?

David Pecker: I did.

Emil Bove: That was on May 6th of 2021, do you recall that?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And you submitted that Declaration under the penalty of perjury, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And in that Declaration you described the legal advise that you had received relating to the agreement with Karen McDougal, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And the position that you and your lawyers took was that the agreement was lawful, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And there were certainly no suggestions in your sworn Declaration that you withheld anything from your attorneys in connection with the negotiation of the August 2016 agreement?

Joshua Steinglass: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Emil Bove: Your position with the FEC was that you were completely truthful with your lawyers, right?

David Pecker: Yeah. Yes.

Emil Bove: And the attorneys argued to the FEC that that was part of the reason that you had not committed a campaign finance violation, correct?

David Pecker: Can you repeat that again, please?

Emil Bove: You were represented by counsel in the FEC investigation, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And so was AMI, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And it was the same lawyers, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And they were making arguments on your behalf, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And also on behalf of AMI, correct?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Emil Bove: And they were arguing to the FEC that you had not committed a campaign finance violation, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And you believed in 2021 that that was true, correct?

David Pecker: Yeah.

Emil Bove: And that's why you authorized your lawyers to make those arguments to the Federal Regulatory Agency, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And you submitted a sworn Declaration under penalty of perjury describing the facts, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And in that Declaration you asserted to the FEC, under penalty of perjury, that you sought legal advise relating to the August 2016 agreement with Karen McDougal, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And your lawyers relied on that sworn Declaration to argue to the FEC that there was no violation, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And you were familiar with the argument that they were making, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: This was important to you, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: Similar to the situation with the FBI?

David Pecker: Correct.

Emil Bove: And we have talked a lot about that the October 2019 meeting with the District Attorney's Office, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And after that meeting, your hope was that at least the criminal proceedings were over, correct?

David Pecker: Yes, I thought it was over.

Emil Bove: And you wanted this civil regulatory investigation to get resolved also, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: You were focused on it, correct? And you believed that what your lawyers were saying to the FEC was true, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And you are aware that one of the things that your lawyers argued to the FEC was that the Washington Post had suppressed information relating to Paula Jones in connection with the 1996 election, correct?

Joshua Steinglass: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Emil Bove: You were answering questions yesterday about some boxes relating to President Trump. Do you remember those questions, sir?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And I think what you said was that there was a request from Michael Cohen to get access to these boxes so that he could look at what was inside of them, correct?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Emil Bove: There was some suggestion by Michael Cohen that he was concerned about what would happen if you left AMI, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And he wasn't -- I am just trying to make sure what I thought you were saying, what your understanding was, okay? He was not suggesting to you that this was a long-term media problem, right? He was just concerned about your Time Magazine job applications?

David Pecker: If you can clarify that. What you are asking?

Emil Bove: You were exploring some opportunities in 2016 and 2017, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And there was at least a possibility that you could take on a role at Time Magazine, correct?

David Pecker: In 2016, I was looking -- we were looking to acquire all of Time. I wasn't looking to just take a job and leave to become President of Time. I was acquiring it. It was a matter of acquiring the company.

Emil Bove: And there would be a change of roles for you, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And in connection with these conversations with Michael Cohen, you did actually have somebody review these boxes that we have been talking about, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And based on your review you saw -- you knew that everything in there was worthless, right?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Emil Bove: You are not suggesting that there is a trove of sensitive information about President Trump at the National Enquirer, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: There was nothing -- there was nothing, it was worthless, correct?

David Pecker: There was nothing in those boxes?

Emil Bove: And you believe they were worthless?

David Pecker: They were worthless.

Emil Bove: You have an agreement with the District Attorney's Office, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: That's an agreement that you entered into in October of 2019, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And what's your understanding of your obligations under that agreement?

David Pecker: To be truthful on everything that I testify to on the questions that are given to me by any agency.

Emil Bove: And at this trial, all sides asked you a lot of questions, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: Some harder than others?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And you understand that, ultimately, they will decide whether or not they think you were truthful, right?

David Pecker: I have been truthful to the best of my recollection.

Emil Bove: And, ultimately, they will decide whether you complied with the agreement, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: Nothing further, Judge.

Juan Merchan: Thank you. People, any redirect?

Joshua Steinglass: Yes, Judge.

Note: [Redirect examination by Joshua Steinglass.]

Joshua Steinglass: Good afternoon, Mr. Pecker.

David Pecker: Good afternoon.

Joshua Steinglass: I want to show you People's 161 in evidence. We can show it to everybody. It's in evidence. Do you remember being asked about this by Mr. Bove on cross-examination?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: This is an invoice that you testified was prepared by Daniel Rotstein?

David Pecker: Yes, that's correct.

Joshua Steinglass: And he asked you whether you were mistaken when you testified yesterday that this document was made and kept by AMI, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: When AMI gets an invoice, even from a third-party, do they keep it as part of their business records?

David Pecker: Yes, they do.

Joshua Steinglass: And is it kept by AMI to justify expenditures?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: So were you mistaken about anything when you testified earlier in this trial that this document was made and kept or made or kept by AMI?

David Pecker: I --

Joshua Steinglass: My question was a bad one. Do you want me to rephrase it?

David Pecker: Please.

Joshua Steinglass: Was this document kept by AMI in the regular course of business?

David Pecker: Yes, it was.

Joshua Steinglass: Now, you testified that prior to signing the contract with Ms. McDougal, that the general counsel of AMI consulted election, outside of election counsel, is that right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: You didn't personally speak to the outside counsel, did you?

David Pecker: No, I did not.

Joshua Steinglass: And did you -- I believe you told us, but who was AMI's general counsel at the time?

David Pecker: Cameron Stracher.

Joshua Steinglass: Now, prior to -- withdrawn. Is Cameron Stracher the one that reached out to outside election counsel?

David Pecker: Yes, he did.

Joshua Steinglass: Prior to his doing that, did you ever personally tell Cameron Stracher about the agreement you made with Donald Trump in August of 2015 when you agreed to help Mr. Trump's campaign?

David Pecker: No, I never did.

Joshua Steinglass: What was your understanding of what outside counsel was asked to review?

David Pecker: The Karen McDougal agreement.

Joshua Steinglass: The contract?

David Pecker: The contract.

Joshua Steinglass: Did that contract contain provisions that we discussed at length where Ms. McDougal would appear on magazine covers and author articles as a ghost writer?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: And you testified on direct examination that the true purpose of the contract with Ms. McDougal was to acquire her life rights to her story about her romantic and sexual relationship with Mr. Trump, is that right?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Joshua Steinglass: And that you had included the provisions about the articles, the covers, the ghost-written articles to give AMI some plausible deniability?

David Pecker: Yes, that's correct.

Joshua Steinglass: Can we put up People's Exhibit 182, please, paragraph five, and this can go out to everybody. Thank you. It is a little hard for me to read it from back here. This is part of the Statement of Admitted Facts that AMI entered into with the Southern District of New York that is appended to the Non-Prosecution Agreement, is that right?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Joshua Steinglass: And did you say, or did AMI say in this document that AMI's principal purpose in entering into the agreement was to suppress the model's story so as to prevent it from influencing the election?

David Pecker: That is correct.

Joshua Steinglass: Is that true, Mr. Pecker? Was that your purpose in locking up the Karen McDougal story, to influence the election?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: The provisions about her being on the cover, covers and writing articles that she wasn't even writing, why was that included in the contract?

David Pecker: It was included in the contract, basically, as a disguise of what the actual purpose of it was.

Joshua Steinglass: What was the actual purpose of it?

David Pecker: The actual purpose was to acquire lifetime rights to a story so it doesn't -- so it's not published. It wouldn't be published by American Media. It would not be published by any other media source.

Joshua Steinglass: Now, did you ever tell Cameron Stracher, before he consulted outside counsel, that the true purpose of the contract that he was asking outside counsel to review was to influence the election?

David Pecker: No.

Joshua Steinglass: Now, prior to Mr. Stracher's discussion with outside counsel, did you ever inform Mr. Stracher that you intended to transfer Karen McDougal's life rights to Michael Cohen?

David Pecker: No.

Joshua Steinglass: Did you ever tell him that Michael Cohen promised to reimburse you for most or all of the money that you had paid to Karen McDougal?

David Pecker: No, I never did.

Joshua Steinglass: Was there a Retainer Agreement signed by AMI and the outside counsel?

David Pecker: In --

Joshua Steinglass: Do I need to clarify that a little bit?

David Pecker: Yes, please.

Joshua Steinglass: You testified that prior to the signing of the contract with Karen McDougal, that it was your understanding that AMI's general counsel reached out to election counsel to have them review, the outside counsel, to have them review the Karen McDougal contract?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Joshua Steinglass: Was there a retainer agreement completed in connection with retaining such outside counsel?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: Privately, can we please show the witness Bates stamped AM/NYDA 74.23 and 4. Do you see that?

David Pecker: Yes, I do.

Joshua Steinglass: What day was the retainer agreement signed between AMI and outside counsel?

David Pecker: August 5, 2016.

Joshua Steinglass: What is the name of the attorney, the outside attorney, who worked on this matter?

David Pecker: Chris Murray.

Joshua Steinglass: Did Mr. Murray bill AMI for the work that he did reviewing the contract between AMI and Karen McDougal?

David Pecker: Yes, he did.

Joshua Steinglass: As you sit here, I think I asked you this on Tuesday, do you know how much time was billed for his reviewing of the contract?

David Pecker: Less than an hour.

Joshua Steinglass: Okay. Let me show you privately, and just for the attorneys, Judge, AM/NYDA 74.25 through 34. Do you recognize this document?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: Is this a series of bills from Mr. Murray to AMI for work done in 2016?

David Pecker: Yes, it was.

Joshua Steinglass: And I am just going to scroll through all the pages in this exhibit and ask you to keep your eyes out to see if there are any bills for services rendered in the months June, July, August?

David Pecker: Yes, there were.

Joshua Steinglass: So I want to direct your attention to page eight. Do you see a bill for services rendered on August 3rd of 2016?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: And does that refresh your recollection which -- well, does that refresh your recollection as to how many hours AMI was billed in connection with outside counsel's review of the Karen McDougal contract?

David Pecker: It was a half an hour.

Joshua Steinglass: Half an hour. I am showing you what's in evidence as People's Exhibit 156, and this can be shown to everyone. There is the contract that AMI signed with Karen McDougal, is that right?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Joshua Steinglass: And you were asked extensively about this on cross-examination, is that right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: Just to remind us, what is the effective date of this contract?

David Pecker: August 5th.

Joshua Steinglass: Does this contract mention anything about Mr. Trump reimbursing you, this contract that was reviewed by outside counsel?

David Pecker: No.

Joshua Steinglass: Does it mention Michael Cohen's name at all?

David Pecker: No, it does not.

Joshua Steinglass: Does the contract mention anything about the plan to reassign Karen McDougal's life rights to either Mr. Trump or Mr. Cohen?

David Pecker: No, it does not.

Joshua Steinglass: Does the contract mention anything about your agreement to help Mr. Trump's campaign that you reached at the August 2015 meeting at Trump Tower?

David Pecker: No, it does not.

Joshua Steinglass: Does it mention anything about your agreement to undertake certain actions at the request of the campaign?

David Pecker: No, it does not.

Joshua Steinglass: Do the contract even mention the word, campaign?

David Pecker: No.

Joshua Steinglass: Very recently Mr. Bove asked you a series of questions about the FEC investigation into the conduct by AMI. Do you remember those questions?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: And your original position in that case when the -- he asked you a lot of questions I should say, about your original position after the FEC filed a complaint, is that right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: And your initial response was to deny culpability, is that correct?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Joshua Steinglass: Subsequently, you entered into a Conciliation Agreement you testified about, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: And you were shown a page of that Conciliation Agreement by Mr. Bove as, I believe it was, Defendant's AB131?

Emil Bove: Can I have one minute to consult with Mr. Steinglass, please?

Joshua Steinglass: Thank you. On direct examination you testified about a Conciliation Agreement that AMI entered into, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: Can we show privately, please, that agreement, specifically page seven? This is the same page that Mr. Bove showed you --

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: -- on cross-examination, right?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Joshua Steinglass: And he asked you whether your understanding was that AMI had admitted to a campaign finance violation, correct?

David Pecker: Correct.

Joshua Steinglass: And that's what the FEC was investigating, right, whether or not AMI had engaged in a campaign finance violation?

David Pecker: Yes, they were.

Joshua Steinglass: Notwithstanding the fact that, initially, you and your lawyer denied having done so, you did enter into this Conciliation Agreement, is that right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: And this page that Mr. Bove showed you, contains the following language, solely for the purpose of settling this matter and avoiding litigation, with no admission as to the merit of the Commission's legal conclusions, Respondent agrees not to contest that AMI's payment to Karen McDougal to purchase a limited life story right, combined with its decision not to publish the story in consultation with an agent of Donald J. Trump, and for the purpose of influencing the election, constituted a prohibitive corporate in-kind contribution in violation of 52 USC Section 30118(a). Does the page that Mr. Bove showed you contain that language?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: Was it your understanding when AMI entered into this agreement that AMI was acknowledging that the conduct that it had committed in connection with the Karen McDougal payment violated Federal Election Law?

Emil Bove: Judge, I object and ask to be heard at side-bar.

Juan Merchan: Overruled. You want to approach?

Emil Bove: Yes, please.

Note: [Discussion is held at side-bar, on the record.]

Emil Bove: Judge, I can clean some of this up on re-cross, but Mr. Pecker did not sign this agreement. And it's been repeatedly embedded that this is his agreement. This is AMI's agreement entered into at a time after he left AMI. And the cover page is a cover letter from the FEC with the agreement, and says that the matter being investigated, as to when Mr. Pecker was dismissed --

Joshua Steinglass: I think I clarified this was an agreement that AMI entered into. In any event, Mr. Bove, is permitted to clarify anything he wants to.

Juan Merchan: I think Mr. Steinglass has a right to go back and clear it up. I think you left the jury with a certain impression.

Note: [Discussion at side-bar concluded, and the following occurred in open court.]

Joshua Steinglass: I apologize, Mr. Pecker. I don't remember the question, so I am going to ask the court reporter to read it back.

Note: [The question, as requested, was read by the court reporter.]

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: You testified on direct examination that after you entered into the agreement with Karen McDougal, you formulated a plan to sell the life rights to Mr. Cohen, sell her life rights to Mr. Cohen for a sum of money, correct?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Joshua Steinglass: What was the sum of money that you were selling her life rights for?

David Pecker: $125,000.

Joshua Steinglass: And, in fact, I believe you testified that you only entered into the agreement with Karen McDougal in the first place because Mr. Cohen had promised to reimburse you?

David Pecker: Yes, that's correct.

Joshua Steinglass: So, prior to -- withdrawn. You testified on direct, I can show it to you if you like, there was an agreement, a transfer agreement where you were -- had signed and Michael Cohen had signed, and this was the process of transferring the life rights. Do you remember that document?

David Pecker: Yes, I do.

Joshua Steinglass: And you went so far as to sign the document?

David Pecker: I did.

Joshua Steinglass: After that, but before money actually exchanged hands, did you communicate with your general counsel, Cameron Stracher, again?

David Pecker: I did.

Joshua Steinglass: And I do not want to ask you about any privileged questions about what you discussed with Cameron Stracher, but based on that conversation with Cameron Stracher, what became of your plan to transfer Karen McDougal's life rights to Donald Trump?

David Pecker: I, after -- after that conversation, I called up Michael Cohen and told him that the deal was off and to rip up the agreement.

Joshua Steinglass: Can we please show the witness 154, People's 154. And, actually, you can show it to everyone. It's in evidence, I am sorry. Do you remember Mr. Bove asking you a series of questions about this document on cross-examination?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: And he asked you whether this was a standard AMI document?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: And you said that it was, correct?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Joshua Steinglass: It's a fairly standard Source Agreement intended to kind of lock up a source?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Joshua Steinglass: That's something AMI does a lot?

David Pecker: All the time.

Joshua Steinglass: This agreement was amended by People's 155, is that right? Can you show People's 155?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: And one of the amendments that this -- that People's 155 changed in People's 154 was by extending the exclusivity period from 90 days to in perpetuity?

David Pecker: That is correct.

Joshua Steinglass: Whose idea was it to do that?

David Pecker: That was my conversation with Michael Cohen.

Joshua Steinglass: Is it standard operating procedure for AMI to be consulting with the presidential - with a presidential candidate's fixer about amendments to a Source Agreement?

David Pecker: No.

Joshua Steinglass: Who -- withdrawn. Another amendment that was made to the original Source Agreement with Dino Sajudin was to add a one-million-dollar liquidated damages clause?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Joshua Steinglass: Is a one-million-dollar liquidated damages clause on a 30,000-dollar Source Agreement standard operating procedure?

David Pecker: No.

Joshua Steinglass: Why did you amend the agreement to add a one-million-dollar liquidated damages clause?

David Pecker: That was at Michael Cohen's request.

Joshua Steinglass: Is it standard operating procedure to have a presidential candidate's campaign person weighing in on what terms of a contract ought to be amended?

David Pecker: No.

Joshua Steinglass: Speaking of Michael Cohen, you testified on both direct examination and again on cross-examination that Michael Cohen told you that he did not work for the campaign, is that correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: He was paid by the Trump Organization, not by the campaign, is that correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: Now, despite the fact that he did not officially work for the campaign, were you aware of the activities that he engaged in on behalf of the campaign?

David Pecker: Yes, I was.

Joshua Steinglass: Who invited you to Mr. Trump's announcement that he was running for President in the first place?

David Pecker: Michael Cohen.

Joshua Steinglass: Did you ever see Michael Cohen go on television to talk about Mr. Trump's campaign talking points?

David Pecker: Yes. I have.

Joshua Steinglass: I am sorry?

David Pecker: Yes, I did.

Joshua Steinglass: Did you ever know Michael Cohen to work his press contacts on behalf of the campaign?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: Did you ever receive an invite to a campaign fundraiser that Michael Cohen participated in on behalf of Mr. Trump?

David Pecker: Yes, I did.

Joshua Steinglass: After the Access Hollywood tape was released, who contacted you to ask you to remove the Playboy mansion story from the Radar Online archives?

David Pecker: Michael Cohen.

Joshua Steinglass: And during the meeting in which -- during the Trump Tower meeting between yourself, Michael Cohen and Mr. Trump, when you formulated the agreement to help the campaign, was Michael Cohen part of that conversation?

David Pecker: Yes, he was.

Joshua Steinglass: Mr. Bove asked you whether NDAs or Non-Disclosure Agreements were standard operating procedure for AMI. Do you remember being asked that?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: And you testified on cross-examination that during your tenure at AMI there were hundreds of thousands of NDAs, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: On how many of those other NDAs had the CEO, meaning you, the CEO of AMI coordinated with a presidential candidate for the benefit of the campaign?

David Pecker: It's the only one.

Joshua Steinglass: Were there any other instances where a candidate's fixer insisted on amendments to these NDAs?

David Pecker: No.

Joshua Steinglass: You testified on cross-examination that sometimes you suppressed stories to help a friend?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: And sometimes you suppressed stories to gain leverage against the target of a story?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Joshua Steinglass: I think you talked about Tiger Woods, is that right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: And you wanted him to appear on some magazine covers or do something with AMI?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: And so, you acquired a story and depicted him in a bad light and used it to leverage him into giving you what you wanted?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: In this case, did you suppress the stories to help a presidential candidate?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: And you testified on cross-examination that Arnold Schwarzenegger announced his candidacy for governor, and after he announced his candidacy for governor, 30 or 40 women came forward with allegations of sexual harassment, is that right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: And that you told Mr. Bove that you paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to kill those stories?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Joshua Steinglass: I don't want to make you do the math on the spot here, but what was the approximate average of those payments?

David Pecker: The largest one was $20,000. Then the other ones would be anywhere from 500 to $2,000.

Joshua Steinglass: Did you spend anything like the $150,000 to suppress any story in connection with the Arnold Schwarzenegger campaign?

David Pecker: No.

Joshua Steinglass: I believe you also testified that Arnold Schwarzenegger was the frontman for some of your fitness line magazines, is that right?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Joshua Steinglass: Why did you spend money -- and when I say you, I mean AMI. Why did AMI spend money to silence Mr. Schwarzenegger's accusers?

David Pecker: Mr. Schwarzenegger was critical to the body-building industry, as well as the supplement industry, as well a the two leading publications, Us, Muscle Fitness and Flex that we just acquired in the Weider acquisition.

Joshua Steinglass: So, do I understand that to mean that you were, at least in part, motivated by your desire to protect your own brand value?

David Pecker: It was mutually beneficial.

Joshua Steinglass: Your arrangement with Mr. Schwarzenegger?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: When you say, mutually beneficial, it also benefited Mr. Schwarzenegger?

David Pecker: Yes, it did.

Joshua Steinglass: To the extent it benefited Mr. Schwarzenegger's campaign, that sparked an investigation into potential campaign finance violations by AMI, is that correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: And as a result of that, I believe you testified when Mr. Bove asked you questions, you made some new rules to address these concerns, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: Now, when you -- when you -- withdrawn. Prior to your arrangements with Mr. Trump, and I am speaking of the arrangement that was formed in the August 2015 meeting at Trump Tower. Prior to that, did you ever preview with a candidate positive stories about that candidate or negative stories about that candidate's opponents?

David Pecker: No.

Joshua Steinglass: Prior to that August of 2015 meeting, did you ever give a candidate the opportunity to accept, reject or make changes to your stories before they ran?

David Pecker: No.

Joshua Steinglass: Prior to that arrangement with Mr. Trump from August of 2015, did you ever run attack ads against any candidate's adversaries that corresponded to those adversaries' polling numbers?

David Pecker: No.

Joshua Steinglass: Mr. Bove elicited from you that a lot of the articles, the negative attack articles against Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz were recycled, I believe, was the term that he used?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: Notwithstanding the fact that they were recycled at the time that AMI reprinted them, was AMI doing that because those candidates were surging in the polls against Mr. Trump?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: And was that done in coordination with Mr. Trump's campaign?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: You testified on cross-examination that even before your arrangement in August of 2015, that you were friends with Mr. Trump?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: And because you were friends, you didn't run negative stories about him even before this arrangement, is that correct?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Joshua Steinglass: And I believe you told Mr. Bove that you did that for several of your friends?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: Prior to the August of 2015 meeting in Trump Tower, did AMI ever agree to publish stories attacking Mr. Trump's political opponents?

David Pecker: No.

Joshua Steinglass: Prior to the August 2015 meeting in Trump Tower, did AMI ever agree to be the eyes and ears of Mr. Trump's campaign?

David Pecker: No.

Joshua Steinglass: Prior to that meeting, did you ever agree to use your network of sources to actively seek out potentially damaging stories, to report them to Mr. Trump so that he could prevent their publication?

David Pecker: No.

Joshua Steinglass: You were asked a lot about this by Mr. Bove on cross-examination. Let's be very clear here. At that meeting, what is your understanding of what you agreed to with respect to -- withdrawn. Let me come at this a different way. Did you ever, specifically, use the term, catch and kill, in that meeting?

David Pecker: No, I did not.

Joshua Steinglass: What was your understanding about the part of the agreement that involved money?

David Pecker: It was my understanding that I would use the company's sources, geared toward any information that would be coming out on Mr. Trump or the campaign relating to, specifically, women who would be selling their stories, similar to what I experienced with Schwarzenegger 13 years ago. So I notified -- it is my understanding I would, for those stories that come up, I would speak to Michael Cohen and tell him that these are the stories that are going to be for sale, that if we don't buy them, somebody else will, and that Michael Cohen would handle, buy them or try to make sure to get -- that they don't ever get published.

David Pecker: That was my understanding from that meeting.

Joshua Steinglass: You testified on both direct and cross-examination that certain parts of your arrangement with Mr. Trump's campaign were mutually beneficial, is that right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: For example, I believe you told us on direct examination, and told Mr. Bove again on cross-examination, that stories praising Mr. Trump sold magazines, is that right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: And how would you describe the overlap between your readership and Mr. Trump's political base?

David Pecker: Basically, the research that the company did over the years -- based on research that the company did over the years, there was no question that the celebrity audience, the tabloid audience or the other celebrity magazines, Star, Weekly, all loved reading positive stories about Donald Trump. And when he announced his presidency or going from The Apprentice to running for President of the United States, he -- our sales increased, newsstand sales increased, as well as any comments that were made by Mr. Trump about negative comments about his opponents were not -- when we published them, the sales also increased.

David Pecker: So, it was a -- that's clear enough.

Joshua Steinglass: So, if I understand you correctly, running stories that praised Mr. Trump appealed to your readership?

David Pecker: Yes, they did.

Joshua Steinglass: And so, that aspect of the agreement that you reached at Trump Tower was mutually beneficial, is that correct?

David Pecker: Yes, yes.

Joshua Steinglass: Now, you testified a moment ago that the primary purpose for entering into the Non-Disclosure Agreement with Karen McDougal was to acquire her life rights to help the campaign, is that right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: And I believe you told us, and it was in the document that we showed you, you never had any intention of publishing her story?

David Pecker: No, we weren't going to publish her story.

Joshua Steinglass: Mr. Bove asked you, wouldn't that story have sold magazines? Well, let me ask you the question. Had you published a story about a Playboy model having a year-long sexual affair, while he was married, with a presidential candidate, would that have sold magazines do you think?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: That would be like National Enquirer gold?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: But at the time that you entered into that agreement, you had zero intention of publishing that story?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Joshua Steinglass: And despite the fact that publishing that story would have helped your bottom line, you killed the story because it helped the candidate, Donald Trump?

David Pecker: Yes.

Juan Merchan: Is this a good time to break?

Joshua Steinglass: Sure.

Juan Merchan: Jurors, we will stop now for our lunch break. I remind you of all the admonitions, including do not discuss this case either amongst yourselves or with anyone else. Please continue to keep an open mind. Do not form or express an opinion about the defendant's guilt or innocence until all the evidence is in and I have given you my final instructions on the law.

Juan Merchan: Enjoy your lunch.

Court Officer: All rise.

Juan Merchan: You can step down.

Juan Merchan: Please be seated. So, I am not going to rush you. Give me a sense of how much longer you are going to be.

Joshua Steinglass: I have Post Its, on Post Its here. I am going to consolidate over lunch. I think, maybe, a half hour or less.

Juan Merchan: At this point, do you expect to have any re-cross?

Emil Bove: Yes, Judge.

Juan Merchan: All right. Enjoy your lunch. See you at 2:15.

Todd Blanche: Your Honor, we ask that you would ask the People -- direct the People to tell us who their next witness is.

Susan Hoffinger: I informed Ms. Necheles who the next witness is.

Todd Blanche: We will converse at lunch.

Note: [Afternoon Session.]

Court Clerk: Continued case on trial, Donald J. Trump. All parties are present.

Juan Merchan: Good afternoon. Is there anything we need to cover before we bring out Mr. Pecker?

Joshua Steinglass: I don't believe so.

Juan Merchan: Let's get the witness.

Juan Merchan: I remind you that you are still under oath.

Juan Merchan: Please be seated.

Court Clerk: Continuing case on trial, People versus Donald J. Trump. All parties and all jurors are present.

Juan Merchan: Good afternoon. Mr. Steinglass.

Joshua Steinglass: Thank you, Judge.

Joshua Steinglass: Good afternoon, Mr. Pecker.

David Pecker: Good afternoon.

Joshua Steinglass: I am not going to try to keep you here too much longer. You testified on cross-examination that the National Enquirer's circulation was around 350,000 in 2016, is that right?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Joshua Steinglass: Does that count all the people who see the headlines while on line at the supermarket or at Walmart or at other places where it's sold?

David Pecker: That is only the paid circulation for the newsstand and the subscribers.

Joshua Steinglass: You testified earlier that "catch and kill" was not a phrase that you would use to describe your deal with Mr. Trump during that meeting, is that right?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Joshua Steinglass: And Mr. Bove -- I apologize for the pronunciation -- earlier Mr. Bove got you to say on cross-examination that you first heard that name from the Federal Prosecutors, is that right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Note: [Displayed]

Joshua Steinglass: I want to show you People's 180 again. We can show everybody, it's in evidence. This is the Wall Street Journal that both myself and Mr. Bove showed you during questioning several times, is that right?

David Pecker: Yes, it is.

Joshua Steinglass: Can you remind us when this article came out?

David Pecker: This came out on November 4, 2016.

Joshua Steinglass: And you testified that you were certainly aware of this article when it was released, is that right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: Basically it had everything to do with AMI and its deal with Karen McDougal on behalf of then-candidate Trump?

David Pecker: Correct.

Joshua Steinglass: And as CEO, you were certainly familiar with this article?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: You certainly read it?

David Pecker: I did.

Joshua Steinglass: I want to turn to Page 2 for a minute and direct your attention to a phrase on Page 2. Can you read that line out loud, please?

David Pecker: "Squashing stories, that was known in the tabloid world as catch and kill."

Joshua Steinglass: So is it more likely, Mr. Pecker, that you did not first hear this term because prosecutors somehow fed it to you?

David Pecker: I first heard it from the press -- read to the press.

Joshua Steinglass: As Mr. Bove noted during cross-examination, you did not use the phrase "catch and kill" during your direct testimony in this case, did you?

David Pecker: No, I never did.

Joshua Steinglass: In response to Mr. Bove's question this morning, you testified that you wanted nothing to do this Stormy Daniels deal, is that right?

David Pecker: Yes. Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: What did you tell Dylan Howard about your willingness to pay for another story involving Mr. Trump?

David Pecker: I said to Michael Cohen: After paying for the doorman story and the Karen McDougal story, I wasn't going to buy anything further and I wasn't a bank.

Joshua Steinglass: And what did you tell Dylan Howard about it when he first reached out to you? I think you said you were having dinner with your wife on Saturday night?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: When he first reached out to you about the story, what did you tell him? What did you tell Dylan Howard?

David Pecker: I told Dylan Howard that there is no possible way I would buy the story for $120,000, and I didn't want to have anything to do with a porn star.

Joshua Steinglass: And I want to -- withdrawn. Now, you told us a moment ago that you also spoke to Michael Cohen about it?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: Why did you reach out to Michael Cohen when you learned that Stormy Daniels had a story involving sexual infidelity with Mr. Trump?

David Pecker: Based on our mutual agreement back in August 2015, any stories concerning Mr. Trump that would be very embarrassing, I would want to communicate that with Michael Cohen right away. If he heard it from somebody else, he would go ballistic.

Joshua Steinglass: Who is "he?"

David Pecker: If Michael Cohen heard the story, that he heard it from someone else. I was referring to Michael Cohen.

Joshua Steinglass: And so when you -- withdrawn. When you reached out to Michael Cohen, it was, as you just said, to notify him, as you had promised to do in that August 2015 meeting?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Joshua Steinglass: When you told Mr. Bove that you wanted nothing to do with it, you weren't going to print it, is that correct?

David Pecker: Print it or buy it or be associated with it.

Joshua Steinglass: You weren't going to print it, you weren't going to pay for it, you weren't going to be associated?

David Pecker: Correct.

Joshua Steinglass: You were still going to fulfill your obligation to tell Michael Cohen about it so that the campaign would squash it?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: I believe you testified on direct examination that sometime later Dylan Howard came back to you because Michael Cohen hadn't delivered on his promise to pay Stormy Daniels off, is that right?

David Pecker: That's correct. That's correct.

Joshua Steinglass: And he asked you to reach out to Michael Cohen?

David Pecker: Yes, he did.

Joshua Steinglass: I believe you testified on direct examination that you, Michael Cohen and Dylan Howard had a three-way call on October 25, 2016, regarding Stormy Daniels, is that right?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Joshua Steinglass: Can you remind the jury, please, what you discussed on that call?

David Pecker: We called Michael Cohen on the Signal. "We" being Dylan Howard and myself. And Dylan made a presentation to Michael Cohen. He was very aggressive over the phone and told Michael: "These two sources are very important to me. If you don't pay them, you're ruining my reputation. You promised to wire the money two times and you never did." Then Michael Cohen said to me I should buy it. I said to Michael Cohen: "Absolutely not.

David Pecker: I am not paying for the story. I told you a number of times, I don't want to be involved with it. My suggestion to you is, you should buy the story -- " you being Michael Cohen -- "should buy the story, because if you don't, and as Dylan just said to us over the phone, it's going to be sold to another media outlet.

David Pecker: The Boss is going to be very, very angry with you."

Joshua Steinglass: So when you are referring to "The Boss," telling Michael Cohen that The Boss would be very angry with him if he let the story go, who did you mean when you referred to "The Boss?"

David Pecker: Donald Trump.

Joshua Steinglass: Mr. Bove asked you several times about two interviews that you gave to the FBI on July 26th and one on August 2, 2016, do you remember him asking you repeatedly about those, the interviews?

David Pecker: Yes, I did.

Joshua Steinglass: Is it fair to say some topics were discussed on one day and some topics were discussed on the other day and some topics were discussed on both days?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Joshua Steinglass: You did not take notes during those interviews personally, did you?

David Pecker: No, I did not.

Joshua Steinglass: The notes Mr. Bove shown you were taken by FBI agents?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Joshua Steinglass: At one point Mr. Bove showed you a single line in the July 26, 2016 -- 2018 interview, in which an FBI agent wrote in reference to the January 6, 2017 meeting at Trump Tower, "that Mr. Trump did not express any gratitude towards you?"

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: Is that correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: Do you remember him showing you that?

David Pecker: Yes, I do.

Joshua Steinglass: You said, "I didn't say that, he got it wrong?"

David Pecker: That's correct.

Joshua Steinglass: You told Mr. Bove that you have always consistently said that Mr. Trump thanked you at that meeting, is that correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: Do you know how many pages long those interview notes are?

David Pecker: Not off the top of my head. I am sorry.

Joshua Steinglass: I guess that is not a fair question. I am sorry. Let me show you the FBI notes from the August 2nd of 2018 interview that Mr. Bove also showed you. Okay. Specifically, I want to show you Page 6.

David Pecker: Okay.

Joshua Steinglass: So this was, literally, a week after the interview in which your testimony is that the FBI erroneously recorded the fact that you said that Mr. Trump did not thank you?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: And one week later, did you not tell the FBI, "In January 2017, Pecker visited Trump in Trump's office at Trump Tower. At that time Trump told Pecker, in sum and substance, that he, Trump, wanted to thank him, Pecker, for handling the Karen and doorman stories because it would have been very damaging to him." Correct?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Joshua Steinglass: So did you, in fact, tell the FBI that the defendant thanked you for both the Karen McDougal story and the Dino Sajudin story?

David Pecker: Yes, I did.

Joshua Steinglass: Was that the truth then?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: Is it the truth now?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: Do you believe that you have ever been inconsistent about this point?

David Pecker: No.

Joshua Steinglass: I want to show you testimony from the Grand Jury, the Federal Grand Jury in this case that Mr. Bove also referred to. Do you remember him asking you about that?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: There was testimony given on August 13, 2018, do you remember giving that testimony on that date?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: Do you remember Mr. Bove asking you questions about it?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: And this was less than two weeks after the second day of that two-day FBI interview, is that right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: Were you asked these questions and did you give these answers in that Grand Jury: Page 26, line 22: "QUESTION: Now, I would like to draw your attention to approximately January 6, 2017. Did you meet with now President-Elect Trump at his request at Trump Tower? "ANSWER: Yes, I did. "QUESTION: Did you discuss Ms. McDougal? "ANSWER: Yes, I did. "QUESTION: Please tell the Grand Jury about that conversation. "ANSWER: Trump said to me: How is Karen doing?

Joshua Steinglass: Referring to Karen McDougal. So I said: Everything is quiet. Karen is writing her articles for the fitness magazines. Trump said that Karen was a good girl. Then he said that he -- it says as -- I guess it's was -- was very appreciative of the way I handled the McDougal story. He thanked me. He also thanked me for handling the doorman story.

Joshua Steinglass: He said he was very grateful and both these stories could have been very, very damaging?" Were you asked those questions and did you give those answers?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: That was in 2018 in the Federal Grand Jury?

David Pecker: In the Federal Grand Jury.

Joshua Steinglass: The questioning goes on -- excuse me one second. Skipping to line 19. Were you asked the following questions and did you give the following answers: "QUESTION: And I believe you testified that Former-President Trump said that the McDougal story and the doorman story could have been damaging, is that correct? "ANSWER: That's correct. "QUESTION: What did you understand Mr. Trump to mean by damaging? "ANSWER: I believe he was referring to that it would be very damaging to his campaign and his election." Did you give those answers -- were you asked those questions and did you give those answers?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: Was that the truth then?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: Is that truth now?

David Pecker: Yes, it is.

Joshua Steinglass: Is there any confusion on your part about that?

David Pecker: None.

Joshua Steinglass: Mr. Bove asked you about your agreement with the Federal Prosecutors, also known as the Southern District of New York, do you remember questions about that?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: And you have obligations, I believe he asked you about, under that agreement, is that right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: Excuse me. I am referring to your Non-Prosecution Agreement.

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: Among other things, you have to provide truthful information, is that correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: You have to cooperate fully with the Southern District of New York, the Federal Prosecutors, and any other law enforcement agencies designated by that office?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Joshua Steinglass: Did anyone from the -- when you were dealing with the Feds?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: Did anyone from the Southern District of New York or the FBI, did either of them ever suggest to you that they wanted you to say anything other than the truth?

David Pecker: Absolutely not.

Joshua Steinglass: Now, you testified on cross-examination that you spoke several times with members of the New York County District Attorney's office over the last few months, is that right?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Joshua Steinglass: And, in fact, Mr. Bove asked you in particular if you met with some of the Assistant District Attorneys sitting here?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: Including myself?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Joshua Steinglass: Mr. Bove asked you whether we decide whether you fulfilled your obligation to testify truthfully, is that right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Joshua Steinglass: Mr. Pecker, did anyone from the New York County District Attorney's office ever suggest to you that they wanted you to do anything other than tell the truth?

David Pecker: Absolutely not.

Joshua Steinglass: What did we tell you?

David Pecker: I was told to be truthful on any questions that were asked of me, only be truthful.

Joshua Steinglass: Thank you very much, Mr. Pecker.

Juan Merchan: Mr. Bove.

Emil Bove: Thank you, Judge.

Emil Bove: Mr. Pecker, before lunch you were asked some questions by Mr. Steinglass about "attack ads," do you recall those questions?

David Pecker: Yes, I do.

Emil Bove: The National Enquirer didn't run any attack ads relating to President Trump's opponents, correct?

David Pecker: Can you define for me that, what the headlines were?

Emil Bove: There were headlines, but not attack ads?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Emil Bove: We talked about some of those headlines this morning, right?

David Pecker: We did.

Emil Bove: Do you remember that before lunch Mr. Steinglass referred to Michael Cohen as a "fixer?"

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And you said repeatedly during your testimony that Mr. Cohen told you he was President Trump's personal attorney?

David Pecker: Yes, he did.

Emil Bove: You know from your experience that private attorneys can hold fundraisers for campaigns without being a part of the campaign, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: That type of fundraiser doesn't make a private attorney some part of the campaign, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And you were asked some questions by Mr. Steinglass just now and before lunch about Karen McDougal, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And I think before lunch Mr. Steinglass referred to Ms. McDougal's story as National Enquirer gold, right?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: Do you remember that phrase?

David Pecker: I do.

Emil Bove: And you were very clear on cross-examination that Ms. McDougal did not want to publish that story, right?

David Pecker: That is correct.

Emil Bove: She wanted to promote her name and her brand, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: She was a legitimate celebrity at the time, right?

David Pecker: Let me say this: Did she meet the celebrity category at that time?

David Pecker: No.

Emil Bove: She was a leading fitness model, correct?

David Pecker: She was a leading fitness model.

Emil Bove: I think you testified on cross-examination this morning that she was one of the first women ever on the cover of Men's Fitness magazine?

David Pecker: That's correct. That was in 1999. I also mentioned that was prior to my ownership, prior to the ownership.

David Pecker: She was on that magazine, that's correct.

Emil Bove: She was also the Playmate of the Year, right?

David Pecker: Yes, she was.

Emil Bove: And she had also been on the covers of other magazines between 1999 and 2016, correct?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Emil Bove: So there was real value to her brand, correct?

David Pecker: I wouldn't say there was value to her brand to a media company. To myself it would be.

Emil Bove: There was enough value that ABC was offering her a spot on Dancing with the Stars, right?

David Pecker: Yes, because she was -- she offered them her romantic story to sell.

Emil Bove: And there was real value in an opportunity beyond Dancing with the Stars, correct?

David Pecker: For Karen McDougal it was.

Emil Bove: Right. You were asked some questions about the Conciliation Agreement with the agency. Do you remember those questions?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: The Conciliation Agreement was entered into between the FEC and AMI, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And the FEC actually decided to take no further action against you personally, correct?

David Pecker: Yes, that's correct.

Emil Bove: And I just want to make sure I understand. In 2016, you didn't think you were doing anything wrong, did you?

David Pecker: No, I didn't.

Emil Bove: And in 2021, you submitted a Declaration to the FEC that said that, more or less, correct?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: And I would like you to take a look at that Declaration. It's not in evidence. It's Defense Exhibit A132.

Emil Bove: I can hand one up.

Juan Merchan: Thank you.

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: Have you had a chance to take a look?

David Pecker: Yes, I did.

Emil Bove: That is your signature on the bottom left?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: It's dated May 6th, correct?

David Pecker: May 6th, that's correct.

Emil Bove: This is a copy of the Declaration that you submitted to the FEC?

David Pecker: Yes, it is.

Emil Bove: Your Honor, defense offers Defense A132.

Joshua Steinglass: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Please approach.

Joshua Steinglass: First of all, if he is putting in this as a prior inconsistent statement, the witness has already acknowledged the inconsistency. You don't get to prove up a prior inconsistent statement with extrinsic evidence once the witness has acknowledged the inconsistency. Also, we haven't gotten notice of this exhibit.

Emil Bove: This is being offered in response to the redirect.

Juan Merchan: Assuming it's an inconsistency, if it's conceded, that is the end of it. That is the end of it.

Juan Merchan: Objection sustained.

Emil Bove: Mr. Pecker, at the end of your testimony yesterday, you told a story about an Anthrax incident at AMI?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Emil Bove: You said that President Trump was one of the first people to reach out to you to see if you were doing okay?

David Pecker: Yes.

Emil Bove: That is one of the reasons that you had and still have a long friendship with him?

David Pecker: That's correct.

Emil Bove: You know that he cares about people?

David Pecker: I do.

Emil Bove: And he cares about his family, right?

David Pecker: Yes, I do.

Emil Bove: And you believe that, right?

David Pecker: Of course I do.

Emil Bove: And so you understand that the types of stories that we were talking about during your testimony today in 2016, those were actually things that were stressful to him and his family, correct?

Joshua Steinglass: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Emil Bove: Nothing further.

Juan Merchan: Anything else?

Joshua Steinglass: No.

Juan Merchan: Thank you, sir. You can step down.

David Pecker: Thank you.

Juan Merchan: People, your next witness, please.

Rhona Graff: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, with respect to the exhibits, People's Exhibits 82 and 83 for identification, which of those contacts did you recognize to be Mr. Trump's contact for Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels that were entered into and maintained in the Trump Organization Outlook computer system?

Rhona Graff: Yes, I did.

Susan Hoffinger: And, now, I just want to direct your attention to the last exhibit, which is People's Exhibit 85 for identification. Did you recognize those to be calendar entries for Mr. Trump for various dates between January 16th and January 19th of 2017, that were entered into and maintained in the Trump Organization Outlook computer system?

Rhona Graff: Yes, I did.

Susan Hoffinger: And for each of these various types of records that we just discussed that you reviewed, emails, contacts and calendar entries, were each of those generated in the regular and ordinary course of business of the Trump Organization?

Rhona Graff: Yes, that is correct. Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Was it part of the business of the Trump Organization to make and keep each of those records?

Rhona Graff: Yes, it was.

Susan Hoffinger: Were those entries in those records made at or close to the time of the transactions or events to which they relate?

Rhona Graff: Yes, they were.

Susan Hoffinger: Were the person or persons who made those records under a business duty to do so accurately?

Rhona Graff: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: At this time, your Honor, I offer into evidence People's Exhibits 68, 69, 69B, 70, 71, 73, 75, 76, 82 and 83 and 85.

Juan Merchan: Any objection?

Susan Necheles: No objection.

Juan Merchan: Those exhibits are accepted into evidence.

Note: [Whereupon, Exhibits 68, 69, 69B, 70, 71, 73, 75, 76, 82, 83 and 85 were received into evidence.]

Susan Hoffinger: Thank you, your Honor. I can take the thumb drive back.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we now put up, which is in evidence, I would like to see People's Exhibit 82. That will come up on your screen.

Note: [Displayed]

Susan Hoffinger: So showing you People's Exhibit 82. Can you please explain to the jury what this is?

Rhona Graff: It's an entry in "contacts" for Karen McDougal and it lists her -- it's redacted, but it lists her business phone number, business address, and email address, and then there is a notation for an old address.

Susan Hoffinger: So is there a total of two physical addresses listed?

Rhona Graff: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And a cell phone number and an email address?

Rhona Graff: Correct.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you create this contact for Karen McDougal in the Trump Organization's computer system for Mr. Trump?

Rhona Graff: I believe I did.

Susan Hoffinger: You can take that down now. Can we please show for everyone People's Exhibit 83, also in evidence.

Note: [Displayed]

Susan Hoffinger: Can you please tell the jury what that is on your screen?

Rhona Graff: It's an entry in our contact system for Stormy, Stormy Daniels. I believe it contains her mobile phone number.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you -- you said you understand this to be a contact for Stormy Daniels, is that right?

Rhona Graff: Correct.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you create this contact for Stormy Daniels in the Trump Organization's computer system for Mr. Trump?

Rhona Graff: I believe I did.

Susan Hoffinger: You can take that down now. Thank you.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, did you on one occasion see Stormy Daniels physically waiting in the reception area of the offices of Trump Tower?

Rhona Graff: I have a vague recollection of seeing her in the reception area on the 26th floor.

Susan Hoffinger: And did you see her at that time, prior to Mr. Trump running for President, beginning in 2015?

Rhona Graff: To the best of my recollection, yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And when you saw her at Trump Tower, did you know at that time that she was an adult film actress?

Rhona Graff: Yes, I did.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, I am going to ask you to take a look at --

Susan Hoffinger: Please put up for everyone People's Exhibit 85 in evidence.

Note: [Displayed]

Susan Hoffinger: Can you tell us what this is?

Rhona Graff: It's an entry in the electronic appointment calendar, dated January 17, 2017, at 1 p.m.

Susan Hoffinger: I apologize. Is this Page 1? Without blowing it up, let me ask you a general question about this exhibit. There are a number of calendar entries in this exhibit?

Rhona Graff: Correct.

Susan Hoffinger: Are these documents contained in this exhibit calendar entries for Mr. Trump from approximately the dates of January 16th to January 19th of 2017?

Susan Hoffinger: Do you believe you entered this calendar entry in the Trump calendar?

Rhona Graff: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Does this show that Donald Trump was working at Trump Tower on January 17, 2017?

Rhona Graff: It should reflect that.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we show Page 1.

Note: [Displayed]

Susan Hoffinger: What does this document show?

Rhona Graff: It's another entry in the appointment calendar for a Teleprompter practice session on the 25th floor in Trump Tower, on January 17, 2017, at 1 p.m.

Rhona Graff: I believe it was.

Susan Hoffinger: Nothing further.

Note: [Cross examination by Susan Necheles.]

Susan Necheles: Good afternoon. How are you today?

Rhona Graff: Good afternoon.

Susan Necheles: You were asked on direct examination about working for President Trump, right?

Rhona Graff: Correct.

Susan Necheles: You worked for President Trump for 34 years, is that correct?

Rhona Graff: That is correct.

Susan Necheles: What was it like working for President Trump?

Rhona Graff: I never had to do the same day twice in all that time. It was a very stimulating, exciting, just a fascinating place to be.

Susan Necheles: And was he a good boss?

Rhona Graff: I think that he was fair. And, you know, he was fair and -- - what is the word I was looking for -- a respectful boss to me in all that time.

Susan Necheles: He promoted you a number of times?

Rhona Graff: He did.

Susan Necheles: Gave you a lot of responsibility?

Rhona Graff: My responsibilities definitely evolved over the years when I was there.

Note: [Senior Court Reporter Theresa Magniccari was relieved by Senior Court Reporter Laurie Eisenberg.]

Susan Necheles: And he respected you, right?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Rhona Graff: I'd like to think so.

Juan Merchan: Overruled.

Susan Necheles: Respected your intelligence?

Rhona Graff: I don't think I would have been there 34 years if he didn't.

Susan Necheles: What were your days like?

Rhona Graff: Again, every single day was different. That was part of why it was a very unusual place to be. There was no typical day, but I usually get there early in the morning before he came in. You know, kind of get his office ready for the day. You know, look at the calendar, see what was happening that day. You know, kind of anticipated what needed to be done.

Rhona Graff: Those kinds of things.

Susan Necheles: And he was working on a whole variety of things, correct?

Rhona Graff: Always.

Susan Necheles: He was in the real estate business, right?

Rhona Graff: Right. It evolved from when I started. It was primarily real estate when I started, and through the years it evolved into many businesses.

Susan Necheles: He wrote books?

Rhona Graff: Right. Many books. Obviously, he entered into the television realm when The Apprentice started, sports, you know, in many areas.

Susan Necheles: A lot of licensing deals?

Rhona Graff: Licensing deals, right, once The Apprentice came along. The Licensing Division became a big part of the company.

Susan Necheles: Lots of speaking engagements?

Rhona Graff: Correct.

Susan Necheles: Political fundraisers?

Rhona Graff: Correct.

Susan Necheles: And you helped with all those things, right?

Rhona Graff: I did.

Susan Necheles: Your discussions with President Trump, were they solely about business?

Rhona Graff: Ninety-nine point nine percent of the time.

Susan Necheles: Did you discuss things other than business? Your family?

Rhona Graff: On occasion. On occasion, he would ask me, "How is your family doing?" Sometimes, if it was a long day in the office, I appreciated it, he poked his head in and would say, "Go home to your family." It was very thoughtful of him. I didn't always go because I wouldn't get up and leave, but I thought it was a nice extra touch that he would think to do that.

Susan Necheles: Did President Trump invite you and your husband to his inauguration?

Rhona Graff: Yes, he did.

Susan Necheles: Did he arrange for you to sit up close?

Rhona Graff: I was on the platform. I don't think I was that close. I don't think I deserved to be that close, frankly, but it was an honor to be on the platform.

Susan Necheles: That was a special place to be sitting?

Rhona Graff: I'd say it was a pretty unique, memorable experience.

Susan Necheles: Now, you were asked on direct examination right now about Stormy Daniels, correct?

Rhona Graff: Right.

Susan Necheles: Am I correct that part of your job duties was to work with the producers of the TV show The Apprentice?

Rhona Graff: That was one of the things that I did, yes.

Susan Necheles: And President Trump was actively involved in producing The Apprentice, correct?

Rhona Graff: I'd say he was fairly hands-on, yes.

Susan Necheles: It was a very popular television show, right?

Rhona Graff: At the time it was probably "the" most popular television show.

Susan Necheles: Am I correct that it brought many people to Trump Tower?

Rhona Graff: There was a lot of interest, you know, globally, nationally, internationally, about The Apprentice.

Susan Necheles: And it made President Trump into a big star, correct?

Rhona Graff: I think it elevated him to a whole other platform, from being primarily known as a businessman to being an entertainer. Almost at that point, you know, rock star status.

Susan Necheles: And he was constantly on the cover of magazines in that time period?

Rhona Graff: I think that's fair to say, yes.

Susan Necheles: And The Apprentice was a very profitable show for President Trump?

Susan Hoffinger: Your Honor, I'm going to object at this point.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Susan Necheles: During that time period, with respect to Stormy Daniels, President Trump was very involved in and interested in finding contestants for The Apprentice, correct?

Rhona Graff: I think so. More when it involved Celebrity Apprentice than he was in the initial few years of it.

Susan Necheles: What was Celebrity Apprentice?

Rhona Graff: When the show officially began, they put out a kind of general casting call for people to be on the show. So it was just regular people that wanted to apply and be on television. And then I think they were looking for a new format as the years went on, kind of bring new juice to the show, and they decided now to make it The Celebrity Apprentice.

Rhona Graff: So, instead of other casts members, they would bring in well-known people, really well-known people to join the cast.

Susan Necheles: Celebrity Apprentice began in 2007, is that correct?

Rhona Graff: I believe so.

Susan Necheles: And during that time period, President Trump would talk constantly about what celebrities would be good to cast on that show, right?

Rhona Graff: I think he took a good interest in it.

Susan Necheles: He would talk about that with you, right?

Rhona Graff: With me and many of the other people in the office.

Susan Necheles: And you understood that he wanted celebrities who were colorful or interesting people to be on that show, right?

Rhona Graff: I think that's a smart casting choice, yes.

Susan Necheles: That's what he would talk about, right?

Rhona Graff: He would when we were talking about casting, yes.

Susan Necheles: He wanted people who were controversial sometimes, right?

Rhona Graff: Some maybe more than others.

Susan Necheles: That was because President Trump believed about having controversial people --

Susan Hoffinger: I'm going to object at this time.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we approach?

Juan Merchan: Yes.

Note: [Whereupon, the following proceedings were held at sidebar.]

Susan Hoffinger: This is going way beyond the scope of the direct. I let it go for a little while, but this is the basis of my objection.

Juan Merchan: I agree.

Susan Necheles: She asked about Stormy Daniels coming up. Stormy Daniels came up there because she was being cast.

Susan Hoffinger: So, ask him the question.

Juan Merchan: One second.

Susan Necheles: To get to that, I have to explain President Trump was very involved in that. Our whole defense or a lot of our defense in this case is he was involved with Stormy Daniels over The Apprentice. She knows directly about that. They asked on direct about Stormy Daniels coming up to the office and being in the cast.

Susan Necheles: That's why they called her.

Juan Merchan: They asked a couple of questions about that. You're going really far afield. Why don't you ask --

Susan Necheles: I have to talk about The Apprentice so they understand.

Juan Merchan: Get to it.

Susan Necheles: Can I have a little latitude?

Juan Merchan: I think you already had a little latitude.

Note: [Whereupon, the following proceedings were held in open court.]

Susan Necheles: Am I correct, you would often hear President Trump talking on the phone with people who were interested in being on The Apprentice?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Susan Necheles: Well, his office was right next to yours, right?

Rhona Graff: Well, I could not hear. There was a big wall behind us, and I couldn't hear him on the phone unless it was very loud.

Susan Necheles: Okay. But, you heard discussions about him discussing about people being on The Apprentice, right?

Rhona Graff: He would vocalize sometimes people that he was interested in to members of the staff, you know, and I would overhear it. I don't recall him saying directly to me, but it was discussed.

Susan Necheles: Am I correct that prior to Stormy Daniels coming up to the office at Trump Tower, you recall hearing President Trump discuss whether Stormy Daniels would be a good contestant?

Rhona Graff: I vaguely recall hearing him say that she was one of the people that may be an interesting contestant on the show.

Susan Necheles: Okay. And the prosecutor just referred to her, I think, as an "adult film actress", correct?

Rhona Graff: Uh, yes.

Susan Necheles: And you understood that to mean that she was, colloquially speaking, a porn star, right?

Rhona Graff: I'd say that's a good synonym for it.

Susan Necheles: And you knew she was a porn star because you had heard discussions about her, right?

Rhona Graff: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And you had heard President Trump say that he thought she would be an interesting addition to The Apprentice, correct?

Rhona Graff: I can't recall a specific instance when I heard it. It was part of the office chatter.

Susan Necheles: And when Stormy Daniels showed up to Trump Tower to meet President Trump, you understood that she was there to discuss being cast for The Apprentice, correct?

Rhona Graff: I assumed that.

Susan Necheles: And I understand your assumption was based on the discussions you had heard, the office chatter, right?

Rhona Graff: Correct.

Susan Necheles: Now, some of the exhibits -- one of the exhibits that you were shown is People's Exhibit -- People's Exhibit 73.

Susan Necheles: Can we pull that up? It's in evidence.

Susan Necheles: You saw this before, correct?

Rhona Graff: FedEx label. Yes, Federal Express.

Susan Necheles: That was a FedEx label that you had requested?

Rhona Graff: No. I -- oh. Yes. Yes. I guess it was requested by Madeleine Westerhout.

Susan Necheles: That was because you were sending checks down to the White House?

Rhona Graff: No. I don't know why she requested it.

Susan Necheles: Okay. Were you involved at all in sending checks down to the White House once President Trump --

Rhona Graff: No, I was not.

Susan Necheles: Okay. But, when you were President Trump's assistant, one of the things that he would do was sign checks, right?

Rhona Graff: Yes. Of course. Yes.

Susan Necheles: And am I correct that when he would sign checks, he was often multitasking?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: Overruled. Overruled.

Rhona Graff: It happened on occasion. It would depend what was going on at the moment and how important the checks were that needed to be signed.

Susan Necheles: Okay. But, you would often see him on the phone when he was signing checks?

Rhona Graff: I believe it happened. It wasn't unusual.

Susan Necheles: And he would also sign checks when he was meeting with other people, right?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Susan Necheles: One of the exhibits is People's Exhibit 70, am I correct?

Susan Necheles: If you could pull that up.

Susan Necheles: Page 1 is a memo. You see that in front of you?

Rhona Graff: Yes, I do.

Susan Necheles: Can we look at Page 2 also?

Susan Necheles: It's a newspaper article, right?

Rhona Graff: Correct.

Susan Necheles: Madeleine Westerhout -- who is Madeleine Westerhout?

Rhona Graff: She was the -- Mr. Trump's -- President Trump's Executive Assistant in the White House.

Susan Necheles: And she sent you this and asked you to send this newspaper article to Allen Weisselberg, right?

Rhona Graff: Correct.

Susan Necheles: It was a common practice of President Trump to clip articles like this, correct?

Rhona Graff: I don't know when he was at the White House how common it was, but certainly when he was at The Trump Organization, it was very common.

Susan Necheles: He would send them to various people, right?

Rhona Graff: Yes.

Susan Necheles: He would often write a little note on the article, right?

Rhona Graff: Often.

Susan Necheles: So, President Trump sending an article to Allen Weisselberg was not at all unusual, right?

Rhona Graff: No.

Susan Necheles: During the time you were working for him, you saw him send thousands of articles to people, correct?

Rhona Graff: Over the time period I was there, I would say that's reasonable.

Susan Necheles: And you were asked on direct examination, also, about whether The Trump Organization was paying your legal fees, correct?

Rhona Graff: I believe so.

Susan Necheles: And you met with the prosecutor a number of times before testifying here today?

Rhona Graff: Yes, I did.

Susan Necheles: And the only reason you're here, testifying today, is because you worked at The Trump Organization, right?

Rhona Graff: I believe so.

Susan Necheles: You have nothing personal to add to this, right?

Rhona Graff: I can't believe I do, no.

Susan Necheles: You don't want to be here, do you?

Rhona Graff: Correct.

Susan Necheles: And lawyers are expensive, aren't they?

Rhona Graff: I haven't seen the bills, but I assume they are.

Susan Necheles: And you understand The Trump Organization is paying for the lawyers for all of the employees, right?

Rhona Graff: That is my understanding.

Susan Necheles: And that's because they're all only here because --

Susan Hoffinger: Objection, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: Sustained. Sustained.

Susan Necheles: No one -- is the payment of your legal fees conditioned at all on how you testify?

Rhona Graff: No, that's not my understanding.

Susan Necheles: No one from The Trump Organization has told you how to testify, right?

Rhona Graff: Absolutely not.

Susan Necheles: You're just here testifying to the truth, right?

Rhona Graff: That's correct.

Susan Necheles: And the only reason your legal fees are being paid is because --

Susan Hoffinger: Objection, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Susan Necheles: Thank you. I have no further questions.

Juan Merchan: Anything else?

Susan Hoffinger: Nothing, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: You may step down. Please approach.

Todd Blanche: Your Honor, may we approach? Oh.

Note: [Whereupon, the witness is excused from the stand.]

Donald Trump: [To the witness as she leaves the well area] Are you okay?

Juan Merchan: Please approach.

Note: [Whereupon, the following proceedings were held at sidebar.]

Juan Merchan: Yes, Mr. Blanche?

Todd Blanche: My request is, after the next witness, before cross, if we could have a brief break. We didn't know this witness was testifying, and our printer in the back broke. My understanding is they're trying to fix it. If it's not fixed, I'll just need to pull stuff up on my iPad.

Juan Merchan: This is actually -- this is the best time to take a break, right now. We'll take about a ten-minute break right now. Who is your next witness?

Susan Hoffinger: Mr. Farro.

Juan Merchan: Thank you.

Note: [Whereupon, the following proceedings were held in open court.]

Juan Merchan: Jurors, we're going to take our recess. You can step out.

Note: [Whereupon, the jurors and the alternate jurors are excused.]

Juan Merchan: Let's take 15 minutes.

Court Officer: Your county of residence.

Gary Farro: I live in Monmouth County, New Jersey.

Juan Merchan: Good afternoon, Mr. Farro.

Rebecca Mangold: May I inquire?

Juan Merchan: You may inquire.

Note: [Direct examination by Rebecca Mangold.]

Rebecca Mangold: Good afternoon, Mr. Farro.

Gary Farro: Good afternoon.

Rebecca Mangold: I'm going to ask you to speak into the microphone and slowly so the court reporter can take down what you're saying. Where do you work?

Gary Farro: I work at Flagstar Bank.

Rebecca Mangold: What do you do there?

Gary Farro: I am a Client Adviser, also a Managing Group Director, Managing Director, Executive Manager.

Rebecca Mangold: Are you here to testify voluntarily or complying with a subpoena?

Gary Farro: Voluntarily.

Rebecca Mangold: Are you sure?

Gary Farro: Well, I did receive a subpoena after.

Rebecca Mangold: Are you represented by counsel?

Gary Farro: I am.

Rebecca Mangold: Are they here today?

Gary Farro: Yes, they are.

Rebecca Mangold: Can you tell everybody about your educational background?

Gary Farro: Sure. I attended Monmouth University, received a Bachelor's in finance. And I've also attended Executive Education Programs at The Wharton School.

Rebecca Mangold: And what did you do after you graduated?

Gary Farro: After I graduated, I worked at a wirehouse, which is an investment firm, doing brokerage, and then went into banking shortly thereafter.

Rebecca Mangold: Where did you work in banking?

Gary Farro: I started off working for a bank which was called First Union Bank. They later became Wachovia Bank. Then, when they were purchased by Wells Fargo Bank, I left and went to First Republic. I spent 15 years at First Republic, until last year's demise. And then, last year, went to Flagstar Bank.

Rebecca Mangold: One step at a time. When did you join First Republic?

Gary Farro: In March of 2008.

Rebecca Mangold: Did you say you worked there for 15 years?

Gary Farro: That's right.

Rebecca Mangold: What titles did you hold at First Republic?

Gary Farro: I started as a Relationship Manager. Moved on to a Senior Relationship Manager. Then I moved on to an Executive Managing Director -- excuse me -- Senior Managing Director, and then an Executive Managing Director.

Rebecca Mangold: What was your title in 2016?

Gary Farro: It was Senior Managing Director.

Rebecca Mangold: I think you said there came a time when you left First Republic Bank?

Gary Farro: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Can you describe the circumstances around that for the jury?

Gary Farro: Sure. In March of last year, First Republic Bank was one of the banks that went under, with Signature Bank, as well as Silicon Valley Bank. And a decision needed to be made. They were purchased by Chase Bank. And I decided to move on to another location, which is now Flagstar.

Rebecca Mangold: Is that where you are today?

Gary Farro: Yes, it is.

Rebecca Mangold: Turning back to your work at First Republic Bank, as part of your work at the bank, did you receive training on the bank's policies and practices?

Gary Farro: Yes, I did.

Rebecca Mangold: Did you receive training on banking laws and procedures that the bank was required to follow?

Gary Farro: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Did you receive any training on the statutory and regulatory requirements that the bank is required to follow?

Gary Farro: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Are there laws and regulations that govern what a bank must do when opening a new bank account for a client?

Gary Farro: Yes, there is.

Rebecca Mangold: Does the bank also have policies and practices around opening a new bank account?

Gary Farro: Yes, we do.

Rebecca Mangold: Maybe it sounds like a silly question, but when folks open a bank account and they put information on the bank forms, does the bank actually look at that information?

Gary Farro: Yes, we do.

Rebecca Mangold: And why do they look at that information?

Gary Farro: Well, depending on what the information is, it will help us determine if it's a bank account we want to open or not open.

Rebecca Mangold: Is that information also reviewed to ensure compliance with various laws and regulations?

Gary Farro: Yes, it is.

Rebecca Mangold: And does the bank take any steps to actually verify the information that their clients put on bank account paperwork?

Gary Farro: I was not sure what was done in the back office. I'm front. Certainly, if somebody stands out immediately -- for instance, sending currency to another sanctioned country as a regular practice, it would be shot down. But, we have a BSA Compliance Team that does further information on that.

Rebecca Mangold: For people who may not be more familiar with the alphabet soup of bank compliance, can you describe what BSA means?

Gary Farro: Sure. Bank Secrecy Act. It's the method of protecting the bank and making sure we're not doing transactions or opening any types of account that could present not only reputational risk to the institution, but also be against the law.

Rebecca Mangold: So, it's a law that sets forth a number of requirements that the bank has to follow?

Gary Farro: That's correct.

Rebecca Mangold: How about AML?

Gary Farro: AML is anti-money-laundering. It's another form of oversight to ensure that clients aren't using an account to filter money through.

Rebecca Mangold: I think you referenced something that you referred to as "the back office". What is the back office?

Gary Farro: So, a bank has three lines of defense. The first would be your client-facing employees, which would be, you know, people like myself, as well as individuals who work in the offices on the ground level, where you would do your typical transaction. The next would be your BSA/AML Compliance Team. Above that would be Audit.

Rebecca Mangold: So, there were multiple different departments within the bank, in other words, checking to make sure that every account and transaction complied with the law?

Gary Farro: That's correct.

Rebecca Mangold: And turning now, specifically, to banking transactions -- take a minute if you need water.

Gary Farro: I'm good.

Rebecca Mangold: Were there certain types of transactions that required more review by the bank?

Gary Farro: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Can you give us some examples?

Gary Farro: A wire is something that is -- requires multiple layers of review. Account opening requires multiple layers of review.

Rebecca Mangold: And how about types of transactions with particular types of people?

Gary Farro: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Was one of the types of transactions that requires more review a transaction with a political candidate?

Gary Farro: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: And did First Republic Bank also require more review for transactions involving the media industry?

Gary Farro: Um, not necessarily the media industry. But, if it was something that could pose reputational risk, then that would be determined. That's above my pay grade. That would be determined by our second level of support.

Rebecca Mangold: Were there any transactions that the bank did not process at all?

Gary Farro: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Can you give us some examples?

Gary Farro: Any transaction that would be going to a sanctioned country, any transaction that would be going to someone who would be considered on a person-of-interest list, potential terrorist, something along those lines, we would not process that transaction. Then there's also lines of business that we just decide as an institution that we will not do business with.

Rebecca Mangold: Can you give some examples of those?

Gary Farro: We didn't do gambling. We wouldn't do anything in the adult entertainment. We wouldn't do anything that involved check cashing. Those are a couple of examples.

Rebecca Mangold: Can you describe what you mean when you say "adult entertainment"?

Gary Farro: Porno. Um, I guess you would consider them strip clubs, or anything along those lines.

Rebecca Mangold: So, the bank wouldn't do business in the adult film industry, in other words?

Gary Farro: No.

Rebecca Mangold: What would happen if there were -- there was a transaction with paperwork that raised certain red flags? Could that delay a transaction?

Gary Farro: It would delay an account opening or delay a wire, yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Could the bank refuse to process a transaction altogether?

Gary Farro: Yes. We have the right to not do any transaction we don't feel comfortable with.

Rebecca Mangold: And could a bank shut down the client's entire account if they found something that -- in the paperwork that ran afoul of one of the regulations?

Gary Farro: To receive a bank account, yes. An existing account that's open already on the lending side, no.

Rebecca Mangold: Can you explain what you mean by that?

Gary Farro: Well, if someone has a mortgage already, we can't just close out a mortgage once it's agreed to.

Rebecca Mangold: Have you heard the term "shell corporation"?

Gary Farro: I have.

Rebecca Mangold: What is a shell corporation?

Gary Farro: My understanding of a shell corporation is an entity that's opened up to do -- to receive monies and send out wires. It doesn't have an actual business behind it.

Rebecca Mangold: So, it's a corporation without any business operations?

Gary Farro: Uh-huh.

Rebecca Mangold: All right. Now, focusing on the 2016 time period, I think you said you were a Senior Managing Director at that time?

Gary Farro: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: What were some of your responsibilities as a Senior Managing Director?

Gary Farro: As a Senior Managing Director, I led a team of people who did the same job as me, Relationship Managers, as well as manage my own book of business, of clients. I would be working with clients on their day-to-day money management needs, which would include checking, savings, money market, CDs, as well as their lending needs, mortgages, lines of credit, et cetera.

Gary Farro: As well as doing their investment management.

Rebecca Mangold: Was that part of First Republic Bank's private bank?

Gary Farro: Well, First Republic Bank is a unique entity in that it only is a private bank. There is no real retail. Although there is branches on the ground level, it was focused more on working with affluent and high-net-worth individuals.

Rebecca Mangold: Can you just explain at a very high level the difference between private banking and retail banking?

Gary Farro: A retail banking relationship would be someone who, essentially, walks into the branch, does most of the transactions themselves, and does not really look for too much advice except outside a mortgage.

Gary Farro: private banking relationship is when you're assigned to someone who is a Relationship Manager who would, essentially, help you and be your point of contact for all things that you need.

Rebecca Mangold: Were most of your clients -- were all of your clients high-net-worth individuals?

Gary Farro: No. Actually, the good thing about working for First Republic is we never set a barrier to entry. Most private banks have a minimum barrier to entry, which would be you have to have a certain amount in liquid assets at the firm. We never set any barrier of entry. So I had a very wide range of clients of various different levels of wealth.

Rebecca Mangold: About how many clients would you say you worked with while you were at First Republic Bank?

Gary Farro: Before I left, I had about eighteen hundred.

Rebecca Mangold: You got to experience the full range of clients in terms of wealth and industries?

Gary Farro: That's correct.

Rebecca Mangold: In general, in your experience, would you say that high-net-worth clients have more interaction with the banking industry than retail clients?

Gary Farro: Well, private banking clients tend to do more with the individual. They see us as a center of influence and utilize us for more of our services, whether it be on the banking -- day-to-day banking side, lenders side, investment managing side. So, by way of having that singular point of contact, it makes their lives a little easier for typically-very-busy people, so they want that one point of contact.

Rebecca Mangold: Despite being busy people, would you say that wealthy people are generally more familiar with the banking system?

Gary Farro: Depends on -- if I could speak on that for many of my clients, I would say yes. I would not say "all".

Rebecca Mangold: I think you said you had clients in a number of different industries. Would that include the real estate industry?

Gary Farro: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: About how many clients did you have that worked in the real estate industry?

Gary Farro: It's hard to say, but those who are fully focused in the real estate industry would probably be in the 20 or 30 range.

Rebecca Mangold: In general, were real estate clients more familiar with the banking system than an average client?

Gary Farro: I would say so, because they did a fair amount of borrowing on the buildings or whatever they were purchasing, so they learned the banking system a little bit more.

Rebecca Mangold: Did you have any clients that were lawyers?

Gary Farro: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: And based on your work at the bank, are you able to tell the difference between the different type of bank accounts maintained by lawyers?

Gary Farro: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Now, I think you said earlier that you oversaw client relationships. Can you describe a little bit more what that means? Are you filling out paperwork day to day for the clients?

Gary Farro: No. I have a team that works behind me. I would make suggestions on what types of accounts to open or in many cases, you know, it would be lending that I would get more involved with, lending and wealth management. But, I had a team of people that worked under me that would handle the day-to-day paperwork, and I handled the transactions.

Rebecca Mangold: So, you handled the relationships?

Gary Farro: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: So, clients would work with you, and you reached out to other folks in the bank in order to get their needs met?

Gary Farro: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Do you know someone named Michael Cohen?

Gary Farro: Yes, I do.

Rebecca Mangold: How do you know him?

Gary Farro: Michael Cohen was assigned to me after a colleague left as a client in 2015.

Rebecca Mangold: Do you know how long Michael Cohen had been a client of the bank when he was assigned to you in 2015?

Gary Farro: I do not know exactly.

Rebecca Mangold: Had he been a client of the bank for some time by the time you took over the client relationship?

Gary Farro: Definitely a couple of years or so. I'm not sure exactly how much time, though.

Rebecca Mangold: Do you know why you were selected to take over the Michael Cohen relationship?

Gary Farro: I can only tell you what I was told, um, that I was selected because of my knowledge and my ability to handle, um, individuals that may be a little challenging.

Rebecca Mangold: How long did you work with Michael Cohen?

Gary Farro: Um, from 2015 until I believe it was 2018 or '19. I'm not exactly sure of the end date.

Rebecca Mangold: And in those several years where you worked with him, did you have frequent interactions with him?

Gary Farro: Not frequent, no. Michael did a lot of his own business. And, frankly, I didn't find him that difficult. He did a lot of his own business by walking across the street. We had an office that opened right across the street from his office. So, he would do his day-to-day stuff there. But, anything he did need, he called me, and it was always something that was urgent.

Rebecca Mangold: Where was Mr. Cohen's office?

Gary Farro: It was in the Trump Tower.

Rebecca Mangold: Do you know where that is?

Gary Farro: I think it's Fifth Avenue and -- in Midtown.

Rebecca Mangold: You said that there's a First Republic Bank branch close to that office?

Gary Farro: Yeah, 56th and Madison.

Rebecca Mangold: And Mr. Cohen would frequently go to that branch in person?

Gary Farro: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: What was Mr. Cohen's profession?

Gary Farro: He was a lawyer or is a lawyer. I'm not sure.

Rebecca Mangold: And what company did he work for?

Gary Farro: The Trump Organization.

Rebecca Mangold: Do you know if he worked for anybody in particular at The Trump Organization?

Gary Farro: Um, only what he had told me, that he worked for, um, former-President Donald Trump.

Rebecca Mangold: Did he talk about that frequently?

Gary Farro: Yes. He was very excited to be working for him.

Rebecca Mangold: Based on your several years of working with Mr. Cohen, can you identify his home address versus his business address?

Gary Farro: I could.

Rebecca Mangold: And are you able to identify his signature?

Gary Farro: I believe I can.

Rebecca Mangold: Did Mr. Cohen have more than one account at First Republic Bank?

Gary Farro: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Did he already have several accounts at the bank when you took over the client relationship?

Gary Farro: He did.

Rebecca Mangold: And did his accounts at the bank relate to his work at The Trump Organization, or were they his personal accounts and his personal business?

Gary Farro: They were his personal accounts and personal entities. I didn't open any accounts for The Trump Organization.

Rebecca Mangold: Do you know how many accounts Mr. Cohen had opened by the time you took over the client relationship in 2015?

Gary Farro: Not exactly, but I believe it was anywhere between four and five, if you're including lending relationships as well as an account.

Rebecca Mangold: Did he open additional accounts while you were managing the client relationship?

Gary Farro: He did.

Rebecca Mangold: Based on your experience, was Mr. Cohen familiar with the requirements to open a bank account?

Gary Farro: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: And was he familiar with the account paperwork he had to fill out in order to do that?

Gary Farro: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Did Mr. Cohen understand that there was a review process that had to take place by the bank before he opened an account?

Gary Farro: Um, I assume he would be, yes, because he's done it before.

Rebecca Mangold: All right. Switching gears a little bit. During your time at First Republic Bank, did you become familiar with their recordkeeping practices?

Gary Farro: With the recordkeeping of First Republic?

Rebecca Mangold: Yes.

Gary Farro: Yes, I did.

Rebecca Mangold: Do you understand that you are testifying here today, in addition to other things, as a custodian of records for First Republic Bank?

Gary Farro: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: All right. Bear with me because I'm going to have a lot of questions on this. Before testifying today, did you have an opportunity to review files marked for identification as People's Exhibits 361 through 364 and 366 through 379?

Gary Farro: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Do those files contain First Republic Bank emails, banking documents, and client account records?

Gary Farro: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Were all of those records kept and maintained by First Republic Bank for the purpose of evidencing or reflecting the activity of the bank?

Gary Farro: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Did you look at two sets of documents with those file names, one with redactions and one without redactions?

Gary Farro: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: And aside from the redactions, are those two versions identical?

Gary Farro: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: And was the information that was redacted personal identifying information?

Gary Farro: Can you explain the question, please?

Rebecca Mangold: Sure. Was the people's personal phone numbers, email addresses and the like --

Gary Farro: Yes. Because it's documentation, yes.

Rebecca Mangold: -- redacted?

Gary Farro: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: All right. Turning to the emails in the files marked for identification as People's Exhibits 361 through 364 and 366 through 379, did First Republic Bank use emails in the regular course of its business?

Gary Farro: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Did that include the use of emails related to bank clients and bank transactions?

Gary Farro: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Was it the regular course of business for First Republic Bank to use emails for those purposes?

Gary Farro: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Were the emails sent and received at or around the time of the bank transactions and client communications?

Gary Farro: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Were First Republic Bank employees under a business duty to convey information accurately in emails?

Gary Farro: Always.

Rebecca Mangold: Did First Republic Bank have email servers?

Gary Farro: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Do you know where those email servers were located?

Gary Farro: San Francisco, at our home base.

Rebecca Mangold: Were emails that were sent and received by First Republic Bank employees stored on those email servers as part of the ordinary course of business?

Gary Farro: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Did the servers record the content of the messages, the senders, recipients, dates and times for each email sent or received using that server?

Gary Farro: For everything I reviewed, yes.

Note: [Whereupon, Senior Court Reporter Lisa Kramsky relieves Senior Court Reporter Laurie Eisenberg, and the transcript continues on the following page.]

Note: [Continued direct examination by Rebecca Mangold.]

Rebecca Mangold: And, to your knowledge, did the email server record and store that information accurately?

Gary Farro: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Did First Republic Bank rely on that information being accurately recorded and maintained?

Gary Farro: Absolutely.

Rebecca Mangold: So for the emails contained in the People's Exhibits marked for identification, were all of the emails and any related attachments sent or received through the First Republic Bank email server?

Gary Farro: I'm sorry, can you repeat the question?

Rebecca Mangold: Sure. Specifically looking at the email files that you reviewed, were those emails and any related attachments sent or received through the First Republic Bank email servers in San Francisco?

Gary Farro: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Do all of the emails that you looked at reflect bank transactions or client communications?

Gary Farro: Yes, they do.

Rebecca Mangold: Are the types of emails included the same types of emails that were routinely generated as part of the first order of business at First Republic Bank?

Gary Farro: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Do any of the emails contained reflect personal or non-business related activity?

Gary Farro: No.

Rebecca Mangold: Now, and I think you said you also saw First Republic Bank banking records in those files, is that right?

Gary Farro: That's right.

Rebecca Mangold: Did that include account forms, bank account statements and wire transfer forms?

Gary Farro: Yes, in addition to KYC forms as well.

Rebecca Mangold: And can you just explain what you mean by KYC forms?

Gary Farro: KYC is "Know Your Customer." It's a way in which -- that we can help identify that the customer is, in fact, who they say they are.

Rebecca Mangold: And is KYC something that's in place as a result of a law that banks are required to follow?

Gary Farro: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Were the types of bank account records that you looked at the type of records that are routinely generated and relied upon by the bank?

Gary Farro: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Did First Republic create and maintain the bank records in the regular course of its business?

Gary Farro: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Was it the regular course of the business of First Republic to create and maintain these bank account records?

Gary Farro: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Were the entries in the records made at or around the time of the recorded events or transactions?

Gary Farro: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Were the people who made the entries in the records under a business duty to do so accurately?

Gary Farro: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: And the last category, would you say that there were also client account records within the files marked for identification?

Gary Farro: There are.

Rebecca Mangold: Were the types of client account records included the types of business records that were routinely provided by clients to the bank as part of the bank's business?

Gary Farro: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Were they the types of business records that the bank routinely collected, reviewed and maintained in the regular course of its business?

Gary Farro: Yes, they are.

Rebecca Mangold: Was it the regular course of business to collect, review and maintain these types of records?

Gary Farro: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Do the client account records in these files include the types of records that the bank routinely relied upon in making determinations about its clients?

Gary Farro: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: And did these documents conform with the statutory and regulatory requirements that you were familiar with?

Gary Farro: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: I would now offer People's Exhibit 361 through 364, and 366 through 379 into evidence.

Juan Merchan: Any objections?

Todd Blanche: Just one moment.

Todd Blanche: Thank you, your Honor. No objection.

Juan Merchan: People's 361 through 364 and 366 through 379 are accepted into evidence.

Rebecca Mangold: Can we pull up People's Exhibit 361, which is now in evidence.

Note: [Displayed]

Rebecca Mangold: Mr. Farro, can you see that on your screen?

Gary Farro: I can.

Rebecca Mangold: Is this a First Republic Bank email?

Gary Farro: Yes, it is.

Rebecca Mangold: And can we blow up the top portion with the words, "there you can."

Rebecca Mangold: Is that easier to read?

Gary Farro: It is.

Rebecca Mangold: All right. What date was this email sent?

Gary Farro: This email was sent on 10/11/2016.

Rebecca Mangold: And who was it sent to?

Gary Farro: It's sent to me.

Rebecca Mangold: And who was it sent from?

Gary Farro: It was sent from Liz Rappaport, who is my assistant.

Rebecca Mangold: And did she go by any other names?

Gary Farro: Lizzie.

Rebecca Mangold: What's the subject of the email?

Gary Farro: "Missed call from Michael Cohen."

Rebecca Mangold: And can you read the text of the email without the phone number information, please.

Gary Farro: Sure. "Michael Cohen just called for you. I let him know that you were out of the office and were unavailable. He asked that you please return his call as soon as you are available at 3212 or on his cell 0114."

Rebecca Mangold: And can we pull up People's Exhibit 362 in evidence.

Note: [Displayed]

Rebecca Mangold: And pull up the top portion of that email.

Rebecca Mangold: Is this a First Republic Bank email?

Gary Farro: Yes, it is.

Rebecca Mangold: What date was this sent?

Gary Farro: On 10/13/2016.

Rebecca Mangold: And who was it sent from?

Gary Farro: It was sent from Elizabeth Rappaport to me.

Rebecca Mangold: And what is the subject of this email?

Gary Farro: "Missed call, Michael Cohen, Regarding: Important."

Rebecca Mangold: And can you read the content of the email to the jury?

Gary Farro: "Please return Michael Cohen's call when you are available today regarding an important matter."

Rebecca Mangold: Do you recall what these two emails related to?

Gary Farro: Yes, I do.

Rebecca Mangold: And did you ultimately connect with Mr. Cohen in response to these messages?

Gary Farro: I spoke to him briefly after that, yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Can you describe that call for the jury?

Gary Farro: Sure. I gave him a call, and he had mentioned that he wanted to open a new LLC account, so I referred him to my team.

Rebecca Mangold: When you say "LLC account," what does that mean?

Gary Farro: That's a Limited Liability Company.

Rebecca Mangold: And does that mean that Michael Cohen had a Limited Liability Company for which he wanted to open an account?

Gary Farro: That's correct.

Rebecca Mangold: Did he say anything else about the account or the LLC at that time?

Gary Farro: Oh, he said it was an account for real estate.

Rebecca Mangold: Can we take those down and pull up People's Exhibit 363 now in evidence.

Note: [Displayed]

Rebecca Mangold: Is this another First Republic Bank email?

Gary Farro: Yes, it is.

Rebecca Mangold: All right.

Rebecca Mangold: Now, I would like to pull up the date and time on the bottom email in the chain on the first page.

Note: [Displayed]

Rebecca Mangold: What date and time was this sent?

Gary Farro: Thursday, October 13, 2016, at 9:23 Eastern Standard Time.

Rebecca Mangold: Can we also pull up the date and time of the top email.

Note: [Displayed]

Rebecca Mangold: Now, traditionally, the top email is a later email in the chain, right?

Gary Farro: It is the later email in the chain, yes.

Rebecca Mangold: And what is the date and time stamp on the top email in this chain?

Gary Farro: 10/13/2016, 7:48 a.m. What they failed to notice there is that's Pacific time.

Rebecca Mangold: Yeah, can you explain how you sent an email before the email that you received?

Gary Farro: Well, I am not in the business of being in Back to the Future, so this was definitely the way that it's pulled through our server in San Francisco, so that would be the time in Pacific.

Rebecca Mangold: So the bottom email on the chain is in Eastern Standard Time and the top email on the chain is in Pacific Time?

Gary Farro: That's correct.

Rebecca Mangold: And is it going to be the case for the rest of the files in -- and emails in the exhibits that we just talked about, that the top email chain only is going to be in Pacific Time?

Gary Farro: That's correct. The most recent email or the last email would be the Pacific Time, everything below it would be in Eastern Time.

Rebecca Mangold: All right. Turning now to the top email in the chain. You said this is an email from you?

Note: [Displayed]

Gary Farro: This is an email from me to one of my team members, Olivia Cassin. And this was after the phone call with Michael Cohen, and he mentioned that he needs an account opened for Michael Cohen immediately and he wants no address on checks.

Rebecca Mangold: Was it unusual for Mr. Cohen to request something get done immediately?

Gary Farro: It was not.

Rebecca Mangold: And it said in the email he wants no address on the checks. Is that unusual?

Gary Farro: Not really for an LLC account, because most people who are employed by someone else do not use that business address for an LLC account, and they don't want to share their home addresses for reasons of being anonymous.

Rebecca Mangold: Turning now to the bottom email. Is this an email from Mr. Cohen to you?

Note: [Displayed]

Gary Farro: Yes, it is.

Rebecca Mangold: And are there attachments to the email?

Gary Farro: I can't tell by looking at this.

Rebecca Mangold: If you look at the top most --

Gary Farro: Oh, yes, yes, there is, based upon the -- there is an attachment, a PDF attached to it.

Rebecca Mangold: Can we flip to the second and third page of the PDF.

Note: [Displayed]

Rebecca Mangold: Can you see those?

Gary Farro: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: What type of document is this?

Gary Farro: This is a document that is provided by the IRS that gives an Employee Identification Number for a new account, a new business that's being opened.

Rebecca Mangold: Can we zoom in on the top left where it shows the address line.

Note: [Displayed]

Rebecca Mangold: What does it say there?

Gary Farro: "Resolution Consultants LLC. Michael Cohen, sole member."

Rebecca Mangold: Do you have an understanding of what Resolution Consultants LLC was?

Gary Farro: It was -- my understanding was it was a real estate consulting company.

Rebecca Mangold: And was that the LLC that Mr. Cohen referred to in the phone call to you earlier in that day?

Gary Farro: That's correct.

Rebecca Mangold: And was he calling to set up an account for this entity, Resolution Consultants LLC?

Gary Farro: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Turning now two pages forward.

Note: [Displayed]

Rebecca Mangold: Can you see that document?

Gary Farro: I can.

Rebecca Mangold: Can we blow up the top portion of the document.

Note: [Displayed]

Rebecca Mangold: Can you describe what this is?

Gary Farro: Yes. This is issued where the LLC was established in Delaware. So this would be the date of the establishment, which was on the 13th of September, 2016.

Rebecca Mangold: I'm sorry, what did you say the date was?

Gary Farro: It was September 13th, 2016.

Rebecca Mangold: Is that 13th or 30th?

Gary Farro: Oh, I'm sorry. 30th.

Rebecca Mangold: Do you know what this form is called?

Gary Farro: If you go back to the thing, it will go to full size, you know, I don't know exactly what it's called. I know it's -- this is the formal document that establishes the -- it in Delaware.

Rebecca Mangold: Would you refer to this as an Entity Formation Document?

Gary Farro: Yeah, that's what it is, it's an Entity Formation doc.

Rebecca Mangold: Okay. Let's go one page forward. And how about this, what is this particular document?

Note: [Displayed]

Gary Farro: So this is the Certificate of Formation, so this goes with the prior document. And this is the establishment of Resolution Consultants LLC.

Rebecca Mangold: And who signed the Resolution Consultants Certificate of Formation document?

Gary Farro: Michael Cohen.

Rebecca Mangold: All right.

Rebecca Mangold: Let's take that down. And can we pull up People's Exhibit 364 in evidence?

Rebecca Mangold: Is this another First Republic Bank email?

Gary Farro: Yes, it is.

Rebecca Mangold: And what's the date of this email?

Gary Farro: The date on this email is 10/13/2016.

Rebecca Mangold: And what's the time stamp here?

Gary Farro: 8:43 a.m.

Rebecca Mangold: And does that mean in New York it was 11:43 a.m.?

Gary Farro: That's correct.

Rebecca Mangold: Who is the email to and from?

Gary Farro: It is to Michael Cohen and from Olivia Cassin.

Rebecca Mangold: And are you also copied on the email?

Gary Farro: I am cc'd on it, yes.

Rebecca Mangold: And can you read the substance of the email to the jury?

Gary Farro: The entirety of it?

Rebecca Mangold: Just the first paragraph. I'm sorry.

Gary Farro: "Please find the attached paperwork to establish the account for Resolution Consultants LLC. Please complete all of the highlighted areas and sign where indicated. Please review the information in the business information to ensure that it is accurate."

Rebecca Mangold: Can you explain what was going on in this email?

Gary Farro: Yes. The -- obviously, Olivia and Michael had spoken and she was sending him the paperwork to establish the LLC account for Resolution Consultants.

Rebecca Mangold: And this is in response to his request in the phone call to you earlier that same day?

Gary Farro: That's correct.

Rebecca Mangold: All right. Turning now to People's Exhibit 366 in evidence.

Note: [Displayed]

Rebecca Mangold: And pulling up the top portion of this email. Who is this email to and from?

Gary Farro: To Olivia Cassin from Michael Cohen.

Rebecca Mangold: What's the date of the email?

Gary Farro: 10/13/2016, at 6:19 p.m.

Rebecca Mangold: And that's Pacific?

Gary Farro: That's Pacific.

Rebecca Mangold: What's the subject of the email?

Gary Farro: Subject is "Regarding: Account Paperwork."

Rebecca Mangold: Okay. And are there attachments to this?

Gary Farro: There are.

Rebecca Mangold: All right.

Rebecca Mangold: Can we flip to the first page of the attachment.

Note: [Displayed]

Rebecca Mangold: And look at the top left portion of the page. Can you tell what type of document this is?

Gary Farro: This is what we call the "master signature card." This will determine who is able to sign on behalf of the account.

Rebecca Mangold: Is this a standard record that First Republic Bank required its clients to fill out to open an account?

Gary Farro: Any business account would require this document.

Rebecca Mangold: And can we look now at the top third of the page, at the box that says "account name and address."

Note: [Displayed]

Rebecca Mangold: What entity is this an account opening document for?

Gary Farro: Resolution Consultants LLC.

Rebecca Mangold: And directing you now to the bottom row of that same box where it says, "Type of Business." What does it say in "Type of Business?"

Gary Farro: "Management consulting including HR and marketing."

Rebecca Mangold: For people who may not know, what is management consulting?

Gary Farro: Management consulting is pretty encompassing. It would be work that you are consulting on for a number of different types of businesses. In this case, through my understanding through conversations with Michael, it was for real estate.

Rebecca Mangold: And it says "including HR." Do you know -- do you have an understanding of what "HR" means there?

Gary Farro: Human resources. I could expand on that, if you would like. It's each account that you open has a NAICS code.

Rebecca Mangold: I'm sorry, are you referring to the numbers to the left of the word "management consulting?"

Gary Farro: Yeah, the 541611.

Rebecca Mangold: And you said that it's called a NAICS code?

Gary Farro: It's called a NAICS, N-A-I-C-S, code.

Rebecca Mangold: And what is a NAICS code?

Gary Farro: It identifies the type of business, so you have to choose one of those codes. So that's why it says: "Including HR and marketing." It's not as though we thought that he would be in HR and marketing, it's just a general category.

Rebecca Mangold: When you say you have to choose one of those codes, who is the person that filled in this information?

Gary Farro: Well, it wouldn't be me. It would be -- we would ask the client what their line of business is, and then we would identify what would be the most appropriate code.

Rebecca Mangold: So is the information in these forms provided by Mr. Cohen?

Gary Farro: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Turning now to the middle portion of that same page.

Note: [Displayed]

Rebecca Mangold: To the sentence labeled "Number 4." Does it provide you who the authorized signers on the account will be?

Gary Farro: Yes, the only one is Michael Cohen.

Rebecca Mangold: Okay. Turning now to the next page. Is there a signature on this page?

Gary Farro: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Do you recognize that signature?

Gary Farro: Yes, Michael Cohen's.

Rebecca Mangold: And what's the date?

Gary Farro: 10/13/2016.

Rebecca Mangold: Going one page forward. What type of document is this?

Gary Farro: So this is the Addendum. It's an agreement to open an accounts and services. And this is the information that we would gather on each of the signers. In this case there is only one signer, so this is completed by Michael.

Rebecca Mangold: This is another required account opening document?

Gary Farro: Correct.

Rebecca Mangold: And what does it list as the account name?

Gary Farro: Resolution Consultants LLC.

Rebecca Mangold: And is this document also signed?

Gary Farro: Yes, it is.

Rebecca Mangold: And whose signature is that?

Gary Farro: Michael Cohen's.

Rebecca Mangold: And what date was it signed?

Gary Farro: 10/13/2016.

Rebecca Mangold: All right. Turning now to the following page, is this another bank opening document?

Gary Farro: It is.

Rebecca Mangold: What is the purpose of this bank opening document?

Gary Farro: This gives us an overview on -- of what type of business transaction activity will look like and what type of business it is.

Rebecca Mangold: And taking a look at the top third of the page. In the top box that says "Business Name." What's listed there?

Gary Farro: Resolution Consultants LLC.

Rebecca Mangold: And in the box below that, can you describe -- I'm sorry, we will take that down.

Note: [Displayed]

Rebecca Mangold: Where it says: "Describe the type of business being conducted," what description is provided for Resolution Consultants LLC?

Gary Farro: "Resolution Consultants LLC is a consulting firm. Michael Cohen provides individuals and businesses, including financial services, law firms, technology firms, et cetera, advice on strategy, PR, marketing, best practices and procedures, et cetera. All of his clients are in the USA."

Rebecca Mangold: And is this consistent with the description that Mr. Cohen gave you on the phone call earlier that day about the type of account he wanted to open?

Gary Farro: It's consistent with it, yes.

Rebecca Mangold: All right.

Rebecca Mangold: Turning two pages ahead. I'm sorry, three pages ahead.

Note: [Displayed]

Rebecca Mangold: Do you see a series of questions and check boxes?

Gary Farro: Uh-huh.

Rebecca Mangold: Looking now at the question in -- labeled number 12. What does that say?

Gary Farro: "Is the entity associated with political fundraising/political action committee PAC."

Rebecca Mangold: And what answer is checked?

Gary Farro: "No."

Rebecca Mangold: And do you know why the form includes a question about political fundraising?

Gary Farro: Because it would be something the bank would want to know.

Rebecca Mangold: And if somebody checked "yes," is that something that would require additional review by the bank?

Gary Farro: Yes, it would.

Rebecca Mangold: All right.

Rebecca Mangold: I think we can take this down.

Rebecca Mangold: Now, do you recall what happened with the bank account that Mr. Cohen tried to open for Resolution Consultants LLC?

Gary Farro: Yes. It was -- we did all of our work to establish it, but it was never funded.

Rebecca Mangold: And what does that mean that "it was never funded?"

Gary Farro: A deposit was never made in the account, so the account never went live.

Rebecca Mangold: So the account was never actually opened?

Gary Farro: Technically, no.

Rebecca Mangold: Did Mr. Cohen explain why he didn't fund the account?

Gary Farro: Not until asked, and not until he reached out and stated he wanted to open a different entity instead.

Rebecca Mangold: But just to be clear, the Resolution Consultants account was never opened?

Gary Farro: It was never opened.

Rebecca Mangold: Let's pull up People's Exhibit 367 in evidence.

Note: [Displayed]

Rebecca Mangold: Is this another First Republic Bank email?

Gary Farro: Yes, it is.

Rebecca Mangold: What date was it sent?

Gary Farro: 10/26/2016.

Rebecca Mangold: And how long after the Resolution Consultants account opening day was this?

Gary Farro: Thirteen days, I believe.

Rebecca Mangold: And, again, it's sent at 6:34 a.m. in the time stamp. Does that mean that it was 9:34 a.m. in New York time?

Gary Farro: Yes, it does.

Rebecca Mangold: Who is the email to and from?

Gary Farro: It's from my assistant, Elizabeth Rappaport, to myself.

Rebecca Mangold: And what does the email say?

Gary Farro: "Please return Michael Cohen's call at 3212."

Rebecca Mangold: Did you return Mr. Cohen's call in response to this email?

Gary Farro: I did.

Rebecca Mangold: And can you tell the jury what happened on that call?

Gary Farro: He had stated that he was changing course and no longer wanted to open Resolution Consultants and wanted to open a new account.

Rebecca Mangold: Did he tell you what the new account would be for?

Gary Farro: The same. For real estate.

Rebecca Mangold: And did he express any type of urgency in opening the account?

Gary Farro: Every time Michael Cohen spoke to me, he gave a sense of urgency.

Rebecca Mangold: And this is one of those times?

Gary Farro: This is one of those times.

Rebecca Mangold: All right.

Rebecca Mangold: Can we take this down and show People's Exhibit 368.

Note: [Displayed]

Rebecca Mangold: So what type of document is this?

Gary Farro: This is our internal Know Your Customer form.

Rebecca Mangold: And this is the KYC form that you were referring to earlier?

Gary Farro: That's correct.

Rebecca Mangold: And is the bank required to fill this out for every client and customer?

Gary Farro: Yes, they are.

Rebecca Mangold: And looking now at the portion below the title of the document where it says, "Created By."

Gary Farro: This was created by DeWitt Hutchins.

Rebecca Mangold: Who is DeWitt Hutchins?

Gary Farro: DeWitt Hutchins at the time was a preferred banker. He worked in one of the offices, and the particular office was the one on 56th and Madison.

Rebecca Mangold: Was that the one across the street from Mr. Cohen's office?

Gary Farro: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: What date was the KYC form created?

Gary Farro: On 10/26/2016.

Rebecca Mangold: And it says: "Last updated by DeWitt Hutchins," correct?

Gary Farro: Yep.

Rebecca Mangold: Shortly after that, 11:04 a.m. Pacific?

Gary Farro: That's correct.

Rebecca Mangold: What types of information are included in the KYC form?

Gary Farro: It's due diligence, so it would be the documentation that has been provided, who the signer is going to be, the length of the relationship, who referred it, if we know the client, do we have an existing relationship.

Rebecca Mangold: And what was the legal entity name here for -- associated with the KYC form? I think that's partway down the form.

Gary Farro: Essential Consultants LLC.

Rebecca Mangold: Is Essential Consultants LLC the new LLC that Michael Cohen wanted to create an account for?

Gary Farro: Yes, it is.

Rebecca Mangold: And the KYC form said it was created by DeWitt Hutchins. Was Mr. Hutchins the person who had provided the information to fill out the form?

Gary Farro: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: So, but Mr. Hutchins input the information into the system at the bank, right?

Gary Farro: He input the information at the bank as he spoke with Mr. Cohen. He doesn't -- he didn't just --

Rebecca Mangold: He didn't just make up the information?

Gary Farro: He didn't just make up the information. We don't do that. It was information that was given to him.

Rebecca Mangold: And that information was given to him by Mr. Cohen?

Gary Farro: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Looking now towards the bottom of the first page where it says "document type provided."

Note: [Displayed]

Gary Farro: Uh-huh.

Rebecca Mangold: Can you explain what this is to the jury?

Gary Farro: This is the articles or Certificate of Incorporation/Formation. Very similar to the ones that we looked at earlier.

Rebecca Mangold: What was the date of formation for Essential Consultants LLC?

Gary Farro: 10/17/2016.

Rebecca Mangold: Turning now to the next page.

Note: [Displayed]

Rebecca Mangold: And looking at the questions towards the top third of the page. In the form does it say -- does this have the same question that we saw in the Resolution Consultants form? It says: "Is the entity associated with political fundraising or political action committee."

Gary Farro: Yes. This is just the digital form of what was provided earlier, which would be the hard copy.

Rebecca Mangold: What's the answer to the political fundraising question on the form?

Gary Farro: Is "No."

Rebecca Mangold: Now, turning to the business narrative portion in the middle of the page. What business narrative is provided for Essential Consultants LLC?

Gary Farro: It's Michael Cohen is opening Essential Consultants LLC as a real estate consulting company to collect fees for investment consulting work he does for real estate deals.

Rebecca Mangold: And is that consistent with the description of the LLC that he provided to you on the call earlier that day?

Gary Farro: Yes, it is.

Rebecca Mangold: Do you have an understanding of how it came to be that DeWitt Hutchins was the one filling out this information when Mr. Cohen called you?

Gary Farro: Yes, I do.

Rebecca Mangold: How did that come about?

Gary Farro: Well, when Mr. Cohen called me, I was on a golf course, that's very clich for a banker, I know, but I was on golf course on a day off and, essentially, it was easier for him to walk across the street to open an account than it would be for me to make a series of phone calls to get someone to reach out to him.

Rebecca Mangold: Your Honor, I'm at a natural stopping point now.

Juan Merchan: Sure. Can you approach for a minute?

Rebecca Mangold: Sure.

Juan Merchan: I was just wondering how much more you have with this witness?

Rebecca Mangold: Probably an hour or so.

Juan Merchan: Okay. Do you have that much cross?
