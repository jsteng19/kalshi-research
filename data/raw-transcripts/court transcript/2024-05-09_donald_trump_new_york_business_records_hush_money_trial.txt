Court Clerk: This is the People of the State of New York against Donald J. Trump. Indictment 71543/23. Appearances, starting with the People.

Joshua Steinglass: For the People, ADAs Joshua Steinglass, Susan Hoffinger, Becky Mangold, Matthew Colangelo, Christopher Conroy, and Katherine Ellis.

Susan Necheles: For the defense, Susan Necheles, seated here with President Trump is here, Todd Blanche, Emil Bove, and Gedalia Stern.

Juan Merchan: Good morning. Good morning, Mr. Trump.

Susan Hoffinger: Just a short application.

Juan Merchan: Sure.

Susan Hoffinger: I conferred with Ms. Necheles this morning. Among the Defense Exhibits are J-26. Marked as J-26 is an arrest record for Ms. Daniels from back in 2009. It's an allegation, according to the document, of simple battery, with absolutely no injury, regarding her former husband with whom she's divorced. I asked Ms. Necheles this morning if she was planning to elicit a question about a prior arrest.

Susan Hoffinger: She said she was. We move to preclude that. The case never proceeded and was dismissed without prosecution.

Susan Necheles: I wasn't intending to try to put the record in evidence. I was just going to ask about whether she was arrested.

Juan Merchan: As I say all the time, anybody can be arrested. Any one of us can be arrested when we step outside. That doesn't prove a thing. If it resulted in nothing, you're precluded from going into it.

Susan Necheles: I'm going to ask, instead, if her then-husband accused her of that. I won't say anything about being arrested, just accusing her.

Susan Hoffinger: Anybody can be accused of anything. It has nothing to do with credibility. It was as a result of a divorce proceeding.

Juan Merchan: If it wasn't a result of a conviction or a fine or sentence, no, it's not probative of anything. Anything else we need to go into before we get the witness back on the stand?

Susan Hoffinger: No, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: One thing. I asked on Tuesday if you wanted to submit a request for a limiting instruction, what do you want me to say on that.

Note: [Whereupon, defense counsel confer.]

Susan Necheles: Your Honor, I think that, given the cross, I'm not sure -- it depends where we end at the end of the testimony. Can it wait until then?

Juan Merchan: Yes. I agree. Let's get the witness back.

Court Officer: Witness entering.

Note: [Whereupon, the witness, Stormy Daniels, having been previously duly sworn and/or affirmed, resumes the witness stand and testifies as follows.]

Juan Merchan: Good morning, Ms. Daniels. I remind you, you're still under oath. Let's get the jury, please.

Court Officer: All rise. Jury entering.

Note: [Whereupon, the jurors and the alternate jurors are present and properly seated.]

Court Clerk: Do both parties confirm that all parties are present and properly seated?

Susan Hoffinger: Yes.

Juan Merchan: Good morning, jurors. Welcome back. Ms. Necheles.

Susan Necheles: Thank you, your Honor.

Note: [Continued direct examination by Susan Necheles.]

Susan Necheles: Ms. Daniels, when we ended the day on Wednesday -- or, Tuesday, we were talking about what occurred prior to the 2016 election, correct?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: You recall that President Trump was elected President in November of 2016, right?

Stormy Daniels: Correct.

Susan Necheles: And in 2011, you had given an interview with E! Online where you had said your story about having sex with President Trump was "bullshit", right?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection. Mischaracterization.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Susan Necheles: Well, do you recall that?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Susan Necheles: And -- but, in 2016, you were trying to sell your story, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: We were reviewing People's Exhibit 171-A.

Susan Necheles: If we could pull that up and put that up again. We can turn to Page 2. That can be shown to everybody. That's in evidence.

Susan Necheles: If we can blow up the part starting with: "I have her.", "Is she ready to talk?" Blow up the four from the bottom.

Susan Necheles: You see that in this part, you say that Gina Rodriguez was saying -- you know, was asking whether you were ready to talk, right?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Please approach.

Note: [Whereupon, the following proceedings were held at sidebar.]

Susan Hoffinger: Two things. One. This has been fully gone through last time. She can go through it again, but it's exactly the same. Second. She didn't say anything. These are not her texts. Ms. Necheles had her read the Gina Rodriguez texts to Dylan Howard. I guess if she wants her to read them again -- that's not her testimony.

Susan Hoffinger: She's mischaracterizing.

Susan Necheles: I am not mischaracterizing. I was in the middle of this. I have three minutes, and then I'm done.

Juan Merchan: One thing about this. I gave you latitude on Tuesday. You can ask her if she's aware of some of this, but you can't do it in such a way that you're putting their words in her mouth.

Susan Necheles: Okay.

Note: [Whereupon, the following proceedings were held in open court.]

Juan Merchan: The objection is sustained.

Susan Necheles: At this point, you were asking for money, you wanted money from President Trump, right?

Stormy Daniels: No.

Susan Necheles: You weren't asking for money in 2016?

Stormy Daniels: I never asked for money from President Trump.

Susan Necheles: You asked it from Michael Cohen, right?

Stormy Daniels: No.

Susan Necheles: Well, you wanted to make money from selling your story, right?

Stormy Daniels: I never asked for money from anyone in particular. I asked for money to tell my story.

Susan Necheles: And that's what you're asking in 2016, was for money to be able to tell your story, right?

Susan Hoffinger: Asked and answered.

Juan Merchan: Overruled. You can answer. You can answer.

Stormy Daniels: I was asking to sell my story to publications to get the truth out.

Susan Necheles: But, you entered into a negotiation over a Non-Disclosure Agreement, right?

Stormy Daniels: My attorneys did, yes.

Susan Necheles: And that was your choice, right?

Stormy Daniels: [No response].

Susan Necheles: Well, you made the decision that you wanted your lawyers to do that, right?

Stormy Daniels: I accepted an offer.

Susan Necheles: That was your choice, right?

Stormy Daniels: Not necessarily. I wanted to do a press conference.

Susan Necheles: You would prefer to do the press conference and get no money over making money, is that what you're saying?

Stormy Daniels: Absolutely, if it got the story out.

Susan Necheles: So, why didn't you do that?

Stormy Daniels: Because we were running out of time.

Susan Necheles: You were "running out of time" to get money, right?

Stormy Daniels: No. To get the story out.

Susan Necheles: You could have gone out any day of the week, could have walked out of your apartment, out of your ranch home and given a press conference, right?

Stormy Daniels: I could have.

Susan Necheles: But, you chose not to, right?

Stormy Daniels: I chose to be safe.

Susan Necheles: You chose to make money, right?

Stormy Daniels: [No response].

Susan Necheles: Right?

Stormy Daniels: I chose to take the Non-Disclosure.

Susan Necheles: And, do you recall that in 2016, that at the same time that your lawyer was negotiating with Michael Cohen over a Non-Disclosure Agreement, you were also speaking with a reporter from Slate named Jacob Weisberg? Do you recall that?

Stormy Daniels: I recall talking to someone from Slate. I'm not sure the name.

Susan Necheles: And, Slate, am I correct, is a website that runs stories, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And, you told Weisberg about your supposed affair with President Trump, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And, you told him about the fact that you were negotiating with Michael Cohen for a Non-Disclosure Agreement, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And Weisberg tried to convince you to let him publish the story, right?

Stormy Daniels: No. Um, let me see, he was my backup in case the Non-Disclosure fell through, not enough time.

Susan Necheles: He wanted to publish your story, right?

Stormy Daniels: Everyone wanted to publish the story.

Susan Necheles: But, you stopped talking to him when you got the money. You wanted money from him, right?

Stormy Daniels: I stopped talking to numerous people because I signed a Non-Disclosure, and that was part of the deal.

Susan Necheles: You could have just let Weisberg publish the story, but you wanted money from Weisberg, right?

Stormy Daniels: I could have had anybody publish the story.

Susan Necheles: But, they weren't willing to give you money, right?

Stormy Daniels: No.

Susan Necheles: Am I correct, you told Weisberg you were sharing these details because you were afraid that Michael Cohen was stalling on filing the Non-Disclosure Agreement and, after the election, he wouldn't pay you, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: You said that as an alternative to be paid for your silence, you wanted to be paid for your story, right?

Stormy Daniels: I don't remember. Can you show me where I said that?

Susan Necheles: Sure.

Susan Necheles: Can we pull up J-45 for the witness and the parties, please, and turn to Page 4.

Note: [Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the witness' and the parties' screens.]

Susan Necheles: We can turn to Page 3 and the second paragraph. You can blow that up for the witness.

Note: [Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the witness' and the parties' screens.]

Susan Necheles: Isn't it correct that you told Weisberg that as an alternative to be paid for your silence, you wanted to be paid for your story, right?

Note: [Whereupon, the witness reviews the exhibit on her screen.]

Stormy Daniels: [No response].

Susan Necheles: Is that correct?

Stormy Daniels: I'm sorry. What was that?

Susan Necheles: Isn't it correct that you told Weisberg that as an alternative to being paid for your silence, you wanted to be paid for your story, right?

Stormy Daniels: I don't remember saying that exactly, no.

Susan Necheles: Well, did you tell him that you wanted "something to show" for your experience?

Stormy Daniels: Yes. I wanted the truth to be printed, with a paper trail of some sort, whether it was an interview, a video, or money, that I was telling the truth, to protect me.

Susan Necheles: You wanted money, right?

Stormy Daniels: I wanted the truth to come out.

Susan Necheles: Well, are you saying you didn't tell Weisberg that as an alternative to being paid for your silence, you wanted to be paid for the story?

Stormy Daniels: I don't remember saying that. I just told you that.

Susan Necheles: Isn't it correct that Weisberg told you that Slate did not pay their sources, but he encouraged you to come forward anyway?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: But, you didn't go forward with him, right?

Stormy Daniels: Because I was offered the NDA.

Susan Necheles: Even though you would have gotten your story out, you chose not to go with Slate?

Stormy Daniels: Correct. This was a better alternative.

Susan Necheles: The "better alternative" was for you to make money, right?

Stormy Daniels: The better alternative was to get my story protected with a paper trail, so my family didn't get hurt if the story was out.

Susan Necheles: And the story -- the paper trail was out if the story had gotten out?

Stormy Daniels: Can you repeat that?

Susan Necheles: And the paper trail was out if the story had gotten out?

Stormy Daniels: Correct. With a target on my back and my family's. It was the perfect solution.

Susan Necheles: Am I correct, you told Weisberg another one of your motives was your anger about Trump's opposition to abortion and gay marriage?

Stormy Daniels: No.

Susan Necheles: You don't remember saying that to him?

Stormy Daniels: I don't remember saying that. Bullshit.

Susan Necheles: I want to direct your attention again to J-45 and --

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Susan Necheles: -- and Paragraph 2.

Juan Merchan: There's an objection. Overruled for now.

Susan Necheles: I'm sorry. I didn't hear the objection.

Note: [Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the witness' and the parties' screens.]

Susan Necheles: Directing your attention to Paragraph 2. Isn't it correct, you told him another motivation to go public was your anger about Trump's newfound opposition to abortion and gay marriage?

Stormy Daniels: I don't remember saying that. Was he opposed to abortion? I don't know.

Susan Necheles: Isn't it true that what you were telling Weisberg was you either wanted money or you were gonna hurt him politically?

Stormy Daniels: No.

Susan Necheles: Because that's what you thought, wasn't it, you were threatening that you would try to hurt President Trump politically by telling this story if he didn't give you money, right?

Stormy Daniels: False.

Susan Necheles: And when Michael Cohen was --

Susan Necheles: We can take that down. Thank you.

Susan Necheles: -- was not paying you the money he promised to pay you, you were furious, weren't you?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And didn't you scream at your lawyer, Keith Davidson, and call him a "pussy" and tell him, "You better get money before the election. Otherwise," you "would lose all" your "leverage and" your "story would be worth zero," you told him that, didn't you?

Stormy Daniels: Can you show me where I said that?

Susan Necheles: If we could play what is in evidence as Defendant's Exhibit F-17 interview, and if you could put up the transcript at the same time, F-17-AT.

Susan Necheles: You can blow up the transcript a little bit. Thank you.

Note: [Whereupon, an audio exhibit is played in open court.]

Susan Necheles: Sorry. That was a mistake.

Juan Merchan: It's all right.

Note: [Whereupon, an audio exhibit is played in open court.]

Susan Hoffinger: Judge, I'm going to object.

Juan Merchan: Sustained. Please stop the tape. Please approach.

Note: [Whereupon, the following proceedings were held at sidebar.]

Susan Hoffinger: This has nothing to do with the question that Ms. Necheles asked. This has no mention of the witness. She's just replaying a tape of a conversation between Michael Cohen --

Susan Necheles: I have to look at the transcript. I thought this is the one where she's talking about -- that she's screaming at him.

Susan Hoffinger: Nope.

Juan Merchan: I wanted to say on Tuesday, you guys need to be careful when you put stuff up. Make sure what you're putting up is what you mean to put up. I don't want any mistakes.

Susan Necheles: I thought this was the transcript. I apologize. There's one where she's calling him a "pussy".

Juan Merchan: See if you can find it.

Susan Necheles: I will.

Note: [Whereupon, the following proceedings were held in open court.]

Susan Necheles: I apologize. I put up the wrong tape. F-17-E.

Juan Merchan: Can we look at the transcript first, before you play the tape?

Susan Necheles: Yes. Can you put up the transcript first, please.

Juan Merchan: That's the one we're looking for?

Susan Necheles: Yes. That's it. If you could play that, please.

Note: [Whereupon, an audio exhibit is played in open court.]

Susan Necheles: Do you recall that that's what you were saying -- that's Keith Davidson, that's your lawyer that you heard on the phone right now, right?

Stormy Daniels: Keith Davidson and Michael Cohen, correct?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection. It doesn't refresh her recollection. She said she didn't recall.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Susan Necheles: Do you recall now that you made those statements?

Stormy Daniels: No, I do not, actually. It reminds me I never -- I never yelled at Keith Davidson on the phone. This specifically says that Gina's boyfriend was gonna go out and tell a story, not that I was gonna do this, because I didn't do this. Sounds like a threat from Keith Davidson.

Susan Necheles: So, if Keith Davidson said that, he was lying?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Susan Necheles: But, you got $130,000, right?

Stormy Daniels: I didn't. That was the payment.

Susan Necheles: That was the payment that --

Stormy Daniels: I got a portion of it.

Susan Necheles: -- that was negotiated on your behalf, right?

Stormy Daniels: Correct.

Susan Necheles: And, in return for that $130,000, you signed an Agreement that you would not tell your story publicly, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: I want to put up on the screen People's Exhibit 276, which is the Settlement Agreement. You can show that to all. It's in evidence.

Susan Necheles: If we could blow up the top, the heading of it, please.

Susan Necheles: You described this document, on direct examination, as a contract between people or parties to keep information secret, right?

Stormy Daniels: [No response].

Susan Necheles: Do you recall saying that?

Stormy Daniels: Yes. It's a contract.

Susan Necheles: And you understand that a contract is a legal agreement, right?

Stormy Daniels: Well, I'm not an attorney, but yes.

Susan Necheles: And it was called a Confidential Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release, Assignment of Copyright and Non-Disparagement Agreement, right?

Stormy Daniels: That's what it says, yes.

Susan Necheles: And if we look in the first paragraph --

Susan Necheles: If we could blow up the first paragraph, please.

Susan Necheles: This paragraph talks about who -- that there is a Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release between two parties whose names are acknowledged in a Side Agreement, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: If we can look at the second paragraph, please.

Susan Necheles: It says: "Recitals." These are the things that are then being agreed to by the parties about the facts, right? Do you understand that?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And it said that: "Prior to entering into this Agreement," you "had come into possession of some confidential information," right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And that it related to the other party, the defendant to this Agreement, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: We can go to the next paragraph.

Susan Necheles: And you had claimed that you had been damaged, the other party, the defendant, claimed that he had been damaged, and you were going to have Released Claims, right?

Stormy Daniels: Like I said, I am not an attorney, so I am reading this quickly and -- I signed this based upon what my attorney suggested that I do.

Susan Necheles: Okay. But, you read it, didn't you?

Stormy Daniels: Yeah.

Susan Necheles: We can go to the next paragraph.

Susan Necheles: And this is talking about that you guys were agreeing to sell or transfer those rights, right?

Note: [Whereupon, the witness reads the exhibit on her screen.]

Stormy Daniels: "Any property and property rights" -- yes.

Susan Necheles: We can go to the next paragraph.

Susan Necheles: And this is saying that you are -- the parties are agreeing that this will be kept confidential thereafter, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: Because this was a Confidentiality Agreement, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And, you had referred to it as an "NDA" or a "Non-Disclosure Agreement", right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: We can go to the next paragraph.

Susan Necheles: And this said that the parties want to avoid the expense of a litigation, and so you were settling any disputes between yourselves, right?

Note: [Whereupon, the witness reviews the exhibit on her screen.]

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And you were releasing any claims against each other, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: We can go to the next paragraph.

Susan Necheles: It said that all the things that had been said here are "integral", they're an important part of this Agreement, right?

Note: [Whereupon, the witness reviews the exhibit on her screen.]

Stormy Daniels: I'm not exactly sure what it means. But...[Shrugs].

Susan Necheles: Okay. So, these were some of the provisions in this contract, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And the contract went on for many, many pages, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And what you've been saying here is you're not a lawyer, and these were legal terms, and you didn't understand or you don't feel that you're able to discuss all these legal terms, right?

Stormy Daniels: Not without speaking to an attorney, no.

Susan Necheles: And lawyers negotiated this document, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: Your lawyer you had negotiated it, and Michael Cohen negotiated, right?

Stormy Daniels: That's what I was led to believe.

Susan Necheles: Because you understood that this was a legal matter that was being settled and a legal contract, right?

Stormy Daniels: [Pause]. Yes. Fine. Okay.

Susan Necheles: So, now, on January 10, 2018, The Wall Street Journal published an article that talked about this Settlement Agreement, right?

Stormy Daniels: I need to make sure that was the date, but yes. In January of '18. I'm not sure of the exact date.

Susan Necheles: Can we pull up P1-A1 in evidence

Susan Necheles: See the date there?

Stormy Daniels: It says January 12th.

Susan Necheles: January 12th. Sorry. But, you knew about that article that was coming out before, didn't you?

Stormy Daniels: Keith Davidson said that something was coming out.

Susan Necheles: All right. Am I correct that on January 10, 2018, you signed a statement saying you had not had sex with President Trump, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: If we could put up People's 277.

Susan Necheles: This was that statement, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And you state in there -- that was on January 10, 2018, you put up that statement, right?

Stormy Daniels: That's the day they sent it to me, yes.

Susan Necheles: Well, you signed it. That's your signature on it, right?

Stormy Daniels: I don't remember what day I signed it, but that's the day they sent it to me.

Susan Necheles: Okay. But, that is your signature, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: You state in there: "I recently became aware that certain news outlets are alleging that I had a sexual and/or romantic affair with Donald Trump many, many years ago" -- because it was many, many, many years ago, right?

Stormy Daniels: At this time, it was 12 years.

Susan Necheles: That's many, many, many years before, right?

Stormy Daniels: A lot of manys, but okay.

Susan Necheles: Then you go on: "I am stating with complete clarity that this is absolutely false." Right, this is what you wrote in there?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: "My involvement with Donald Trump was limited to a few public appearances and nothing more." Correct?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: "When I met Donald Trump, he was gracious, professional, and a complete gentleman to me and everyone in my presence." That's what you wrote, right?

Stormy Daniels: Well, to be clear, I did not write this.

Susan Necheles: You signed this statement, right?

Stormy Daniels: I signed it. It was given to me, and I was told that I had to sign it.

Susan Necheles: Then you said: "Rumors that I have received hush money from Donald Trump are completely false." Correct, that's what you said?

Stormy Daniels: Correct. Because it was not a rumor. It was the truth. Very different.

Susan Necheles: "If indeed I did have a relationship with Donald Trump, trust me, you wouldn't be reading about it in the news, you would be reading about it in my book. But the fact of the matter is, these stories are not true." And then you signed that document, correct?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: We can take that down. Thank you.

Susan Necheles: Am I correct that 21 days later, you put out another statement like that?

Stormy Daniels: Michael Cohen released a statement, yes.

Susan Necheles: And you signed it, right?

Stormy Daniels: But, I didn't release it.

Susan Necheles: But, you signed it, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: If we could put up People's 278 in evidence. That could be shown to everybody.

Susan Necheles: On January 30th, again, you denied that you ever had a sexual relationship with Donald Trump, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: You said: "Over the past few weeks I have been asked countless times to comment on reports of an alleged sexual relationship I had with Donald Trump many, many, many years ago. "The fact of the matter is that each party to this alleged affair denied its existence in 2006, 2011, 2016, 2017, and now again in 2018. I am not denying this affair because I was paid hush money as has been reported in overseas-owned tabloids.

Susan Necheles: I am denying this affair because it never happened. I will have no further comment on this matter. "Please feel free to check me out at Instagram at TheStormyDaniels." Right?

Stormy Daniels: That's what it says.

Susan Necheles: That's what you signed, right?

Stormy Daniels: Correct.

Susan Necheles: Am I correct that Michael Cohen had been pushing to get you to sign this, right? That's what you're saying?

Stormy Daniels: Via Keith Davidson. I never spoke to Michael Cohen directly.

Susan Necheles: But -- and you understood that in 2018, President Trump was denying this relationship, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And he wanted you to deny it as well, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And he was not running for election at that point in 2018, was he?

Stormy Daniels: No.

Susan Necheles: There was no election in 2018, right?

Stormy Daniels: No.

Susan Necheles: He was already President, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: But he was concerned -- you understood he was concerned about his family, right?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Overruled. You can answer.

Stormy Daniels: Can't?

Juan Merchan: You can.

Stormy Daniels: I never mentioned anything about his family.

Susan Necheles: Okay. But, there was nothing about an election going on then, right?

Stormy Daniels: No.

Susan Necheles: And you understood, also, that President Trump has a brand, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And you understood that he is concerned about protecting his brand and his image, right?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Overruled. You can answer.

Stormy Daniels: I wouldn't know what he wants to protect.

Susan Necheles: Well, you claimed that you had discussions about business with Mr. Trump, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes. And he never expressed concern about his brand.

Susan Necheles: Didn't you claim, don't you tell a story that he talked about creating an image that was successful?

Stormy Daniels: He implied it.

Susan Necheles: And that's his brand, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes. [Shrugs].

Susan Necheles: So, even though you had agreed that you would not discuss this supposed story, and you had received a lot of money for that Agreement, you then decided you wanted to publicly say that you had sex with President Trump, right?

Stormy Daniels: No. Nobody would ever want to publicly say that. I wanted to publicly defend myself after people attacking me after Michael Cohen told about the story.

Susan Necheles: Well, you wanted to make more money, right?

Stormy Daniels: No. That's why I did 60 Minutes for free.

Susan Necheles: Well, you hired Michael Avenatti to be your new lawyer, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes. [Facial gestures].

Susan Necheles: You then gave an interview to Anderson Cooper on 60 Minutes, right?

Stormy Daniels: I did.

Susan Necheles: That was televised in 2018, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: In that interview, you told the world about what you claimed had happened with President Trump, correct?

Stormy Daniels: Right. And I was not compensated.

Susan Necheles: And you were not paid for that interview, right?

Stormy Daniels: Correct.

Susan Necheles: And you really want to keep saying that, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: But, the interview generated a ton of publicity for you, didn't it?

Stormy Daniels: Lots of bad publicity, yes.

Susan Necheles: A ton of publicity, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And your attorney, Michael Avenatti, hated Trump and announced publicly that he wanted to run to be President of the United States himself, right?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Susan Necheles: Well, Michael Avenatti was helping you get all this publicity, right?

Stormy Daniels: No.

Susan Necheles: Well, he didn't arrange for you to go on CNN?

Stormy Daniels: He arranged for me to go on CNN and The View. Everything else he took for himself.

Susan Necheles: And you knew that getting a lot of free publicity for your story would allow you to then make lots of more money off of your story about President Trump, right?

Stormy Daniels: I actually didn't. I was completely unprepared for how far that went.

Susan Necheles: Well, after giving the Anderson Cooper interview, you were able to negotiate a book contract, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And it was for $800,000 right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: So, now you were able to sell your story for $800,000, right?

Stormy Daniels: I sold my life story, yes.

Susan Necheles: And that was in addition to the $130,000 that you had been paid previously, right?

Stormy Daniels: I didn't receive 130, though.

Susan Necheles: You were paid, but you had to give some of it to Gina Rodriguez and some of it to Keith Davidson, right?

Stormy Daniels: Okay. Yes.

Susan Necheles: Correct?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And so, now you had been paid $930,000, almost a million dollars, for selling the story, right?

Stormy Daniels: I also didn't receive the 800,000.

Susan Necheles: Well, that's what you had contracted to -- agreed to get paid, right?

Stormy Daniels: Minus commissions and what was stolen from me.

Susan Necheles: Okay. But, that's what you had sold your story for, right?

Stormy Daniels: Correct.

Susan Necheles: Am I correct that the centerpiece of your book is about your story about, supposedly, having sex with President Trump?

Stormy Daniels: No.

Susan Necheles: Well, you believed that was the reason people would buy your book, was to read about your description about sex with Donald Trump, didn't you?

Stormy Daniels: Sadly, I thought that's what a lot of people would turn to first. Luckily, the start of -- for me, the start of my story started when I was two-years-old.

Susan Necheles: Chapter 3 started with a joke about whether the reader skips right there and started with the chapter about President Trump, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: That's because that's what you believed people were gonna do, that they would buy the book just for that story?

Stormy Daniels: I don't know. Sad.

Susan Necheles: Well, that's your book, you wrote it?

Stormy Daniels: I did write it.

Susan Necheles: And after you wrote the book, you capitalized even more on the story you were selling by doing a strip club tour called The Make America Horny Tour?

Stormy Daniels: I did not name that tour, and I fought it tooth and nail.

Susan Necheles: That was the tour you went on. You spent a couple of years doing that?

Stormy Daniels: It was a job I had already been doing. Most of those clubs I did four or five times before that. Several of those clubs were in place before the book.

Susan Necheles: But, it was named The Make America Horny Tour?

Stormy Daniels: That's what the publicist called it.

Susan Necheles: Can we show J-15?

Stormy Daniels: I'm sorry. Am I talking too fast?

Court Reporter: It would be nice if you slowed down a bit.

Note: [Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the witness' and the parties' screens.]

Susan Necheles: That was for your tour?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: Can we admit it?

Juan Merchan: J-15 is admitted in evidence.

Note: [Whereupon, Defense Exhibit J-15 is received in evidence.]

Susan Necheles: We can show that.

Susan Necheles: You advertised your tour with a picture of you and President Trump together from the golf tournament?

Stormy Daniels: False. I have no choice how the club advertises, and I never posted this.

Susan Necheles: You did post The Make America Horny Tour?

Stormy Daniels: I never used that tagline. I hated it.

Susan Necheles: You continued this strip tour in 2018 and 2019, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes. I continued doing my job, dancing at clubs, which I've done through 2001.

Susan Necheles: And you traveled throughout America on this Make America Horny Tour, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And you were selling yourself to people who hated President Trump as someone who get could President Trump indicted, right?

Stormy Daniels: I was not selling myself to anyone. I was performing at clubs, and whoever wanted to pay admission. It was not geared towards people only allowed in who hated somebody. These were strip club patrons who had seen me dance. They were fans of my work. A lot of the people I knew from ten years before.

Susan Necheles: Am I correct that you said your fan base was completely different, and that the middle-aged white men who used to populate your show and buy your movies were gone, and in their place were now the so-called resistance, women, gay couples, immigrants, and other social liberals who despised Trump. You said it's pretty much these types of women and it was angry.

Susan Necheles: Do you recall saying that?

Stormy Daniels: I did. The climate in the club certainly changed. I was not selling myself to a certain demographic. I was certainly going on stage and doing my -- the shows I had done since I was 21-years-old.

Susan Necheles: But, now you had a new fan base and were able to get your shows sold?

Stormy Daniels: I was just doing the same job I always did.

Susan Necheles: You also got a job on a reality show called The Surreal Life?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: You promoted interviews on the show, saying you were doing the show so you could tell your "whole story", right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: When you said your "story", that was, supposedly, the story of you having sex with Donald Trump?

Stormy Daniels: It was the full story of my life and what I have been through through all of this.

Susan Necheles: When you did that and were promoting your story, you say: "Then I get to tell the story from our side, without editors or posing or stripping. That was the reason I wrote the book Full Disclosure. People still ask me questions that were in the book. I learned America doesn't read, so you have to put it on reality TV." That was the story you wanted to tell, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And the story, principally, in Full Disclosure was your story about having sex with Donald Trump, right?

Stormy Daniels: It was my entire life story.

Susan Necheles: And you have Tweeted you made a million dollars between the book deal and The Surreal Life, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: You made 200,000 from just appearing on The Surreal Life, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And you also participated in making an NBC documentary about yourself, which aired on television just recently, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And that involved several years of filming and interviews of you, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: In order to get you to cooperate with that documentary, the documentary writers paid you for the rights to your book deal, right?

Stormy Daniels: They didn't have "to get" me "to cooperate". I initially started filming myself.

Susan Necheles: And then you gave that over, the filming -- you were having an affair with the guy who was filming you, right?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Overruled. You can answer.

Stormy Daniels: I was having -- there was 17 people who shot footage of that, including, one of them is my husband.

Susan Necheles: And you started having an affair when you were filming it, right?

Stormy Daniels: There was one of the cameramen, we started dating, and he stopped filming as soon as we started dating.

Susan Necheles: You were married to someone else at the time?

Stormy Daniels: I was separated from my husband.

Susan Necheles: And you were, in fact, paid $125,000 by the documentary people, right?

Stormy Daniels: No, I was not.

Susan Necheles: Well, you didn't receive $125,000 for the rights to your book?

Stormy Daniels: Nope. Not yet.

Susan Necheles: You've been promised that, you're saying?

Stormy Daniels: I'm sorry. What was that?

Susan Necheles: You're saying you were promised that, but you haven't received all the money?

Stormy Daniels: I haven't received all the payments, no.

Susan Necheles: Okay. How much of it have you received?

Stormy Daniels: They gave me a hundred thousand dollars for back footage, but I was not paid for an interview.

Susan Necheles: But, you were paid for the rights to your book, right?

Stormy Daniels: That was part of my contract. You have to ask my attorney, who's sitting there, who did the deal.

Susan Necheles: Okay. But, you received $120,000 from the documentary people, right?

Stormy Daniels: A lot of it was footage that I had to reimburse cameramen for.

Susan Necheles: So, the answer is yes?

Stormy Daniels: Not exactly. You're trying to trick me into saying something that's not entirely true.

Susan Necheles: You are still grossing over 125,000, right?

Stormy Daniels: Supposed to be.

Susan Necheles: Where did you deposit that money?

Stormy Daniels: Into my business account.

Susan Necheles: You have also been holding viewing parties at bars to view the documentary, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And you've been selling tickets to that, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: It's another way you're making money off the documentary and off of this story, right?

Stormy Daniels: Which I haven't actually made any profit. It covers my travel, expenses, and security. No profit.

Susan Necheles: When you say covers your "travel" and "expenses", you're traveling to go to those viewing parties, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes. It's all part of promotion for the film.

Susan Necheles: And you have become a hero at those parties to Trump-haters, right?

Stormy Daniels: I don't know. I don't speak for other people.

Susan Necheles: Well, haven't you said -- didn't you say: "People come up and they're so emotional and put so much on me. They're like, 'You're gonna save the world, you're a patriot, you're a hero,'" right?

Stormy Daniels: You're misconstruing that quote from when I was in a strip club people said that. That's not from a viewing party. That documentary was actually very polarizing for people.

Susan Necheles: So, that is from a strip club that people would come up and say, "You are a hero," right?

Stormy Daniels: I am quoting a lot of women who came up to me in 2018 while I was on stage.

Susan Necheles: But, you are continuing to this day to continue making money to sell a story that you promised will put President Trump in jail, right?

Stormy Daniels: No.

Susan Necheles: Well, isn't it a fact that you keep posting on social media how you're going to be instrumental in putting President Trump in jail?

Stormy Daniels: Show me where I said I would be "instrumental in putting President Trump in jail".

Susan Necheles: All right.

Susan Necheles: If we could show the witness J-43, please. Just for the witness and parties.

Note: [Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the witness' and the parties' screens.]

Susan Necheles: Do you recognize that as your post?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And --

Stormy Daniels: And I don't see the word "instrumental" or "jail".

Susan Necheles: Your Honor, I offer that in evidence.

Juan Merchan: Any objections?

Susan Hoffinger: No.

Juan Merchan: Accepted into evidence.

Note: [Whereupon, Defense Exhibit J-43 is received in evidence and is shown on the screens.]

Susan Necheles: Just one month ago. If we could read this.

Susan Necheles: Blow it up a little bit more.

Susan Necheles: You were responding to the post, someone else's post there?

Stormy Daniels: Yes. Someone calling me a "human toilet". So I capitalized on the joke.

Susan Necheles: The other post: "Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels a/k/a the human toilet are their star witnesses." Right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: You said: "Exactly. Making me the best person to flush the orange turd down."

Stormy Daniels: Yes. I don't see "instrumental" or "jail" there. You're putting words in my mouth.

Susan Necheles: So, when you said you were "the best person to flush the orange turd down", you weren't saying you were going to be instrumental in causing him to be convicted of a crime, that was not what you meant?

Stormy Daniels: No.

Susan Necheles: What does that mean?

Stormy Daniels: I am pretty sure this is hyperbole. If somebody calls me a "toilet", I say I can "flush" somebody. See how that works? [Gesturing]. It goes around.

Susan Necheles: You said you were going to "flush" President Trump?

Stormy Daniels: I didn't say "President Trump". It says "orange turd". So, if that's what's interpreted by you...

Susan Necheles: What do you mean?

Stormy Daniels: I don't know what I mean.

Susan Necheles: You have no idea --

Stormy Daniels: I'm also not a toilet, so it's all... [Gesturing].

Susan Necheles: I'm asking whether you knew what you meant when you said an "orange turd"?

Stormy Daniels: Yes, I do.

Susan Necheles: What did you mean?

Stormy Daniels: I meant I'm not a "human toilet", so if they want to make fun of me, I can make fun of them.

Susan Necheles: You don't want to admit you meant Mr. Trump?

Stormy Daniels: I absolutely meant Mr. Trump.

Susan Necheles: Why did you say no?

Stormy Daniels: It doesn't say "instrumental" and "putting him in jail".

Susan Hoffinger: Can we let the witness complete her answers, please.

Juan Merchan: Did you finish answering the question?

Stormy Daniels: Can you ask your question again?

Juan Merchan: Can we have that read back?

Note: [Whereupon, the requested portion was read back by the court reporter.]

Stormy Daniels: So, what's the rest of the question? I did answer it.

Juan Merchan: That was your whole answer? You finished answering the question?

Stormy Daniels: I believe so.

Juan Merchan: All right.

Susan Necheles: If we could pull up for the witness J-43 -- J-44.

Note: [Whereupon, an exhibit shown on the witness' and the parties' screens.]

Susan Necheles: That's your post, correct?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And we can turn to the next page.

Note: [Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the witness' and the parties' screens.]

Susan Necheles: That's also part of the same post, correct?

Stormy Daniels: I'm not sure.

Susan Necheles: Well, you see --

Stormy Daniels: Because it says that it was suspended.

Susan Necheles: Yes. But, you see how your post is right above that?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And then you're responding to that post below that, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: Okay.

Stormy Daniels: I can't tell if there was something missing or not though, because it says "from a suspended account".

Susan Necheles: Okay. It says "from a suspended account". You understand, you can get old posts before it was suspended on the internet?

Stormy Daniels: If somebody screenshots it.

Susan Necheles: Do you recognize that as something you responded to?

Stormy Daniels: I respond to hundreds of Tweets like this, calling me names. Most -- most -- you know. I'm not sure.

Susan Necheles: Referring to the page before, you --

Susan Necheles: Your Honor, I offer that first page in evidence.

Susan Hoffinger: I object. Can we approach?

Stormy Daniels: I just can't be sure.

Juan Merchan: Sure.

Note: [Whereupon, the following proceedings were held at sidebar.]

Susan Hoffinger: What's happening here, Ms. Necheles is putting in half pieces of these texts. So -- sorry. Posts. They are in response to, as she has just said, threats from other people. Here, she's not clear what she's responding to. Previously, Ms. Necheles has done the same thing on Tuesday. She's put in half of the Tweet, without putting in what she's responding to. It's creating an impression with the jury.

Susan Hoffinger: We have Ms. Daniels' testimony. She's not sure exactly what she was responding to. Given this scenario, whether it was an account she was responding to, she has responded to hundreds or thousands of threatening Tweets.

Susan Necheles: The other part stands on its own. If you want, we'll call a witness on our direct case and say this was --

Juan Merchan: That wouldn't get it in. You want to get in a portion of her response, without letting us know what she was responding to?

Susan Necheles: I was trying to put the whole thing in. I have the whole thing there.

Juan Merchan: The whole thing is her response and a deleted post.

Susan Necheles: But it shows up on the internet from The Wayback Machine. I can put it in on our case.

Juan Merchan: It still won't tell us what the post was.

Susan Necheles: It does. Page 2 tells us the post she was responding to.

Juan Merchan: You can do that later.

Susan Necheles: I'll do it on my case.

Juan Merchan: That's fine.

Note: [Whereupon, the following proceedings were held in open court.]

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Susan Necheles: Ms. Daniels, when President Trump was indicted on this case, you celebrated on Twitter by repeatedly Tweeting and pushing merchandise that you were selling in your store, right?

Stormy Daniels: I Tweeted about his being indicted, yes. And people wanted to ask how they could support me, so I Tweeted the link to my store.

Susan Necheles: You have an online store where you sell merchandise, right?

Stormy Daniels: Sure.

Susan Necheles: I want to show you what has been marked as J-22, please.

Note: [Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the witness' and the parties' screens.]

Susan Necheles: You recognize that? That's -- the first page is a Tweet by you?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: If you can put up the second page.

Note: [Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the witness' and the parties' screens.]

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: That's a Tweet by you, as well?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: I offer those in evidence, your Honor.

Susan Hoffinger: No objection.

Juan Merchan: Accepted into evidence.

Note: [Whereupon, Defense Exhibit J-22 is received in evidence.]

Susan Necheles: If we can display, starting on Page 1.

Susan Necheles: Am I correct that in this first Tweet, you said: "Thank you to everyone for your support and love! I have so many messages coming in that I can't respond. Also, don't want to spill my champagne." Right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: What you're saying is you're drinking champagne because you're celebrating that President Trump was indicted, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: Then you said: "Team Stormy merchandise, autograph orders are pouring in too. Thank you for that as well. But allow a few extra days for shipment." Correct?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: This was on March 30th you said this, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: That was you selling your merchandise, right?

Stormy Daniels: That is me doing my job.

Susan Necheles: Selling your merchandise, right?

Stormy Daniels: Which is part of my job, yes.

Susan Necheles: Turn to the next page.

Susan Necheles: Blow up the text first.

Susan Necheles: You said: "New merchandise is now in the store. Yes, photos and comics are autographed. In celebration of new indictments, all orders in next 45 hours get a free surprise gift." Correct?

Stormy Daniels: Correct.

Susan Necheles: Again, you're celebrating the indictment by selling things from your store, right?

Stormy Daniels: Not unlike Mr. Trump.

Susan Necheles: Pushing your stuff so that you could sell it, right?

Stormy Daniels: Absolutely. I'm not allowed to sell anybody else's things.

Susan Necheles: In fact --

Susan Necheles: We can take that down. Thank you.

Susan Necheles: You have an online store that has -- much of the merchandise is you bragging about how you got President Trump indicted, right?

Stormy Daniels: I got President Trump indicted?

Susan Necheles: Well, aren't you bragging about that in your items that you're selling?

Stormy Daniels: No.

Susan Necheles: I want to show you what has been marked as J-24.

Note: [Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the witness' and the parties' screens.]

Susan Necheles: That's an item that you sell in your store, is it not?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: I offer that in evidence, your Honor.

Susan Hoffinger: No objection.

Juan Merchan: Accepted into evidence.

Note: [Whereupon, Defense Exhibit J-24 is received in evidence and is shown on the screens.]

Susan Necheles: That's one of the items you sell in your store, something called "Stormy, Saint of Indictments candle", right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes. That was made from a store in New Orleans.

Susan Necheles: You're saying that's not you bragging about how you are the Saint of a person who got President Trump indicted?

Stormy Daniels: No. I'm not bragging. I think it's funny that a store made those for me to sell, so I put those on my site.

Susan Necheles: And you're making $40 on each of those, right?

Stormy Daniels: No. I'm actually making about $7.

Susan Necheles: You're also selling Team Stormy merchandise, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: I show you what has been marked J-24 -- I'm sorry.

Susan Necheles: If we could turn to Page 2 of that.

Note: [Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the witness' and the parties' screens.]

Susan Necheles: You recognize that as another item you sell in your store?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: The next page, you recognize that as another item you sell in your store?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: I offer all that in evidence.

Susan Hoffinger: No objection.

Juan Merchan: Accepted in evidence.

Note: [Whereupon, Defense Exhibit J-24 is received in evidence.]

Note: [Whereupon, Senior Court Reporter Lisa Kramsky relieves Senior Court Reporter Laurie Eisenberg, and the transcript continues on the next page.]

Susan Necheles: If we can turn back to Page 2 and blow that up. Page 2 first.

Note: [Displayed]

Note: [Continued direct examination by Susan Necheles.]

Susan Necheles: And that's Team Stormy merchandise? That's an example of the Team Stormy merchandise, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And there are a number of them, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And Team Stormy is the "side" who is opposed to President Trump?

Stormy Daniels: It is whoever is on my side.

Susan Necheles: And your "side" means your side against President Trump, right?

Stormy Daniels: Not exclusively.

Susan Necheles: And if we turn to the next page.

Note: [Displayed]

Susan Necheles: You have a 30-dollar comic book called Stormy Daniels Political Power Comic Book, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And when you are talking about "political power," you are talking about you fighting against President Trump, right?

Stormy Daniels: Keep in mind, I did not write this comic book.

Susan Necheles: But you are selling it, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: So we can take all of that down, please. Thank you.

Susan Necheles: A large part of your livelihood, for a bunch of years now, has been making money off the story that you had sex with President Trump and that you will help President Trump be convicted, right?

Stormy Daniels: No.

Susan Necheles: Well, you testified on direct examination that there are two books you are working on right now, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And what are those books about?

Stormy Daniels: One is called "Rock Star Porn Star." It is about my partner. He's a musician who became a porn star. And the other one is a novel about a girl who grew up in New Orleans. It's nonfiction -- I'm sorry, it is fiction.

Susan Necheles: And did that person, that girl in the novel, have an affair with a presidential candidate?

Stormy Daniels: No.

Susan Necheles: And do you plan to continue to make money off the selling of your story?

Stormy Daniels: I plan to continue to do my job. And to fund my extraordinary legal bills.

Susan Necheles: And there is another way you are making money now, which is by telling people that you have the ability to communicate with ghosts and dead people, right?

Stormy Daniels: I work on a television show called -- well, the title had changed, but it used to be called Spooky Babes.

Susan Necheles: Well, my question was, are you making money by telling people that you have the ability to communicate with ghosts and dead people?

Stormy Daniels: Well, I am making money -- well, I haven't made any money yet, but the idea is to make money on a television show about the paranormal and UFOs and the unexplained.

Susan Necheles: Well, you have made a show and podcast claiming that you can speak to dead people, right?

Stormy Daniels: I have been on lots of podcasts.

Susan Necheles: Well, my question --

Stormy Daniels: Which podcast are you referring to?

Susan Necheles: Are you saying you have not made a show or a podcast telling people that you can speak to dead people?

Stormy Daniels: Yes, we are talking about the paranormal, yes.

Susan Necheles: And you also claimed that you lived in a house in New Orleans that was haunted and that the spirits that are in the house attacked your boyfriend and held him under water, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes, so the house was -- has some very unexplained activity. We brought in experts, people to measure the electromagnetic fields, the religious experts, scientists, people to check for gas leaks. So, yeah, it was a lot of interesting and unexplained activity, so I created a whole entire show. A lot of --

Susan Necheles: Your Honor --

Stormy Daniels: A lot of the activity was completely debunked as, you know, a giant opossum that was under the house, for instance.

Susan Necheles: Your Honor, your Honor, I move to strike all of that now and ask that the witness be instructed to answer the question.

Juan Merchan: No. Overruled.

Susan Necheles: And so, my question was that you claimed that you lived in a house in New Orleans that was haunted and that spirits attacked your boyfriend, is that correct?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And then you say your boyfriend attacked you, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And isn't it a fact that you were the one who attacked your boyfriend?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained. Counselor, we discussed this.

Susan Necheles: No, we did not, not about this, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: Please move on.

Susan Necheles: But, your Honor, this is not the same thing.

Juan Merchan: Please move on.

Susan Necheles: And, shortly thereafter, your boyfriend moved out, right?

Stormy Daniels: Define "shortly"?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Susan Necheles: Well, didn't your boyfriend question your sanity?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Susan Necheles: And you have been making money off of your claim that you are a medium and that you can talk to the dead, right?

Stormy Daniels: I am making money doing -- I am part of a ghost-hunting team that we go into locations, yeah.

Susan Necheles: And you read tarot cards for clients, correct?

Stormy Daniels: Yeah, a lot of my fans like to do things called High Tea and Tarot with Stormy Daniels, and we read tarot cards together.

Susan Necheles: And you charge people for that, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And you claim to be able to speak to people's dead relatives, right?

Stormy Daniels: I make them agree that it's all entertainment, right.

Susan Necheles: And that's what you charge them for?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: But, you claim -- you tell people that that's what you can do, right, speak with their dead relatives, right?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection. Asked and answered.

Juan Merchan: Overruled. You can answer.

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And that's what you have made money off of, right?

Stormy Daniels: One of the ways, yes.

Susan Necheles: All right. So, now, before you started making a living talking with dead people, and selling your story with -- about President Trump, you were an actress, a porn actress, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And you have acted in porn movies, in 200 sex films, right?

Stormy Daniels: Including comps -- compilations.

Susan Necheles: And you've also written and directed 150 sex films, you said in your direct, is that correct?

Stormy Daniels: Give or take.

Susan Necheles: And so, this was your career for over 20 years: Writing, acting, and directing sex films, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: So, you have a lot of experience in making phony stories about sex appear to be real, right?

Stormy Daniels: Wow. I'm a -- [Laughter] That's not how I would put it. The sex in the films, it's very much real. Just like what happened to me in that room.

Susan Necheles: All right. But you're making fictionalized stories about sex, you write those stories?

Stormy Daniels: No. The sex is real. The character names might be different, but the sex is very real. That's why it's pornography and that's a B movie.

Susan Necheles: Okay. But you testified on direct that these films have plots, right?

Stormy Daniels: Some of them do, yes.

Susan Necheles: And the plots are fake, right?

Stormy Daniels: Some of them. Some of them are based on truth.

Susan Necheles: And they are movies, right?

Stormy Daniels: Of course.

Susan Necheles: And you've been writing those stories about sex, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And then you act them out, right?

Stormy Daniels: Sometimes.

Susan Necheles: And you have --

Stormy Daniels: Sometimes I just direct.

Susan Necheles: And you have a lot of experience in memorizing these fictional stories and repeating them, right?

Stormy Daniels: I have of experience in repeating stories and of memorizing stories? I do a lot of that, but not just about sex, I'm pretty sure we all can do that.

Susan Necheles: And you have bragged about how good you are about writing porn movies and writing really good stories and writing really good dialogue, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And now you have a story you have been telling about having sex with President Trump, right?

Stormy Daniels: And if that story was untrue, I would have written it to be a lot better. [Laughter]

Susan Necheles: Because you are a good storywriter, right?

Juan Merchan: I'm sorry, I didn't hear that.

Susan Necheles: Because you are a good storywriter, right?

Stormy Daniels: I'm a good screenwriter.

Susan Necheles: And that story was enough -- you made that real enough sounding to make you millions of dollars, right?

Stormy Daniels: I didn't have to write this one.

Susan Necheles: But it has made you millions of dollars, right?

Stormy Daniels: No.

Susan Necheles: So, you're saying now that you could have written a better story and made more money?

Stormy Daniels: I'm saying I didn't make millions of dollars, and I didn't write this story.

Susan Necheles: Well, you made over a million on your book and the film, or The Surreal Life, right?

Stormy Daniels: Well, some money amassed, but that's not millions.

Susan Necheles: And you've also made money selling merchandise, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And you have made money on your two-year tour of sex clubs, right?

Stormy Daniels: I don't work in sex clubs. I work in strip clubs. So that's a big difference.

Susan Necheles: You made money on your two-year tour working in strip clubs, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And you made money from the documentary, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: Okay. And when you prepared for your testimony with the Prosecutor in this case, you had a number of meetings with them, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And they told you that they wanted to -- you to testify to lots of details so your story would sound credible, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And do you recall that when you testified on direct examination, you gave a whole description of what you say the tile in President Trump's hotel suite looked like, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And you included what you said the tile on the floor looked like, and that it was black and white, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And then Ms. Hoffinger asked you: "Did you mention anything about the floor?" Do you recall her asking you that?

Stormy Daniels: I think so.

Susan Necheles: And you responded, "The black and white tile." And she asked, "Did you mention that?" Do you recall that?

Stormy Daniels: Yeah.

Susan Necheles: And that had been part of your prep, that you were supposed to include certain details in your testimony, right?

Stormy Daniels: There is nothing wrong with preparing a witness. I would hope that any attorney would do that.

Susan Necheles: Okay. That wasn't my question. My question was --

Stormy Daniels: About a tile.

Susan Necheles: That had been part of your prep, that you were supposed to include certain details in your testimony, right?

Stormy Daniels: Truthful facts, yes. Don't forget the facts, that's all I was ever told to do.

Susan Necheles: And those were details that matched what you wrote in your book, right?

Stormy Daniels: I would have to see, but probably.

Susan Necheles: Well, you were prepped so that -- with the Prosecutor, so that you would match -- you would try to match things to your book so that you would look more credible, right?

Stormy Daniels: Well, I don't need to match things to my book because it's the same story. And my story hasn't changed when it comes to those details.

Susan Necheles: And you know that there is no way to check on the details of what you claim happened, right?

Stormy Daniels: No, I did not know that.

Susan Necheles: Well, this supposed sexual encounter that you testified about supposedly occurred 18 years ago, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And so -- and it was just you, supposedly, and President Trump in that hotel suite, right?

Stormy Daniels: And his bodyguard.

Susan Necheles: His bodyguard, you said, was outside the hotel suite, right?

Stormy Daniels: With the doors open. And it was the same floor.

Susan Necheles: You said the doors were open a crack, right?

Stormy Daniels: And then I opened it. He walked in. And the same thing when I exited.

Susan Necheles: Well, he didn't walk in, right?

Stormy Daniels: No. But he stood right there and watched me walk in.

Susan Necheles: And he was standing outside the doors, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And you said in your book that the suite took the entire floor of the hotel?

Stormy Daniels: It's -- I don't know if it took the whole floor, but it had its own elevator.

Susan Necheles: So you got on the elevator, and that was the only suite there?

Stormy Daniels: It was right in front of me.

Susan Necheles: Okay. And --

Stormy Daniels: To be fair, I don't know what was behind me.

Susan Necheles: All right. Now, in fact, your story about what happened between you and President Trump has changed a lot over the years, hasn't it?

Stormy Daniels: No.

Susan Necheles: Well, let's talk about your story.

Stormy Daniels: [Laughter]

Susan Necheles: You said you met President Trump at a celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And that tournament was called the American Century Championship, right?

Stormy Daniels: I'm not sure.

Susan Necheles: And there were a lot of celebrities and sports figures at that celebrity golf tournament, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: Aaron Rogers?

Stormy Daniels: I don't know.

Susan Necheles: Dan Quail?

Stormy Daniels: I don't know. I can't remember.

Susan Necheles: Drew Brees?

Stormy Daniels: Who?

Susan Necheles: Drew Brees?

Stormy Daniels: Oh, I have no idea.

Susan Necheles: Charles Barkley?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: Ben Roethlisberger?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And there were many, many other celebrities there, too, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And the company you worked for, Wicked Production, was one of the sponsors of the golf tournament?

Stormy Daniels: Wicked Pictures.

Susan Necheles: And there was a golf gift room where there was swag given out by various sponsors of the tournament?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And you and the other porn stars who were there took photographs of yourself with a lot of the celebrities, right?

Stormy Daniels: We didn't take the photos. The people who will worked there did, yes. Yes -- but, yes.

Susan Necheles: The people who worked for Wicked Pictures were taking photographs?

Stormy Daniels: And for the golf tournament, yeah.

Susan Necheles: And for the golf tournament. And you said on direct you took pictures with every celebrity that came in there, right?

Stormy Daniels: Every celebrity that came in to talk to me, I took a photograph with. I don't remember all of the names.

Susan Necheles: And you said that there were dozens of celebrities that you took pictures with, right?

Stormy Daniels: I would say so, yes.

Susan Necheles: So the picture that you have or that was in evidence of you with President Trump was just one of the dozens of pictures that you took with celebrities, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And it was taken in a public place, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And there were no other pictures --

Stormy Daniels: Semi-publicly.

Susan Necheles: And there were no other pictures with you and President Trump, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yeah. Right.

Susan Necheles: And you testified on direct that you spoke with President Trump in the gift room and that after he left, his bodyguard, Keith Schiller, came back and asked you for dinner -- to dinner, right?

Stormy Daniels: They hadn't completely left. He walked back.

Susan Necheles: Keith Schiller walked back?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And he is the one who asked you to dinner, right?

Stormy Daniels: He asked me on behalf -- he didn't ask me to go to dinner with him.

Susan Necheles: He's the one who spoke to you, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: Keith Schiller, according to you --

Stormy Daniels: He's -- that's -- he didn't say his name was Keith Schiller, he said: "I work for Mr. Trump."

Susan Necheles: Okay. But it wasn't the President Trump, according to your testimony, who asked you to dinner, it was his bodyguard?

Stormy Daniels: Right.

Susan Necheles: And your testimony was that you said, "Fuck no." That you didn't -- you didn't want to go, right?

Stormy Daniels: Right.

Susan Necheles: But you gave Keith Schiller your phone number anyway and you supposedly entered your phone number -- his phone number into your contacts, right?

Stormy Daniels: Correct.

Susan Necheles: And according to you, later, Mike Mosny, your manager at the time, told you that you should go to dinner at the time, right?

Stormy Daniels: Correct.

Susan Necheles: But this is a totally different story than what you told in 2011, isn't it?

Stormy Daniels: No.

Susan Necheles: Well, in your 2011 -- in 2011, you gave an interview with In Touch Magazine, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And you said on direct that it was for only 15 minutes?

Stormy Daniels: For 15 to 20 minutes. It was a phone call.

Susan Necheles: Wasn't it more like an hour?

Stormy Daniels: I don't think so.

Susan Necheles: And didn't you tell In Touch Magazine that Donald Trump himself asked if you would have dinner with him?

Stormy Daniels: I don't remember saying that. It was Keith.

Susan Necheles: All right.

Susan Necheles: If we could show the witness and the parties J28, Page 3.

Susan Necheles: And am I correct that you said to In Touch Magazine that when you first met Donald Trump, it was actually on the golf course?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And that: "Later when he was in the gift room, he came to talk to me and asked for my number and I gave it to him." Do you recall saying that to In Touch Magazine?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: So you said that, in that Magazine in 2011, you said it was Donald Trump who asked you for your number, right, not Keith Schiller?

Stormy Daniels: I didn't specify. I left out the names of all of the other people not to get them involved, that's why I specifically said just "he" asked.

Susan Necheles: All right.

Stormy Daniels: But he was there. They were together.

Susan Necheles: All right. So, didn't you say: "The first time I met him was actually on the golf course," right? You said that?

Stormy Daniels: Uh-huh.

Susan Necheles: And when you said that, the "he" you were referring to was Donald Trump, right?

Stormy Daniels: Keith was there as well, yes.

Susan Necheles: And you said "he" was introduced to everyone. And that's Donald Trump, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And you said: "He kept looking at me. And then we ended up riding to another hole in the same golf cart together and he's, like, I want to come talk to you later." Right?

Stormy Daniels: Uh-huh.

Susan Necheles: That's what you told them?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And that was still President Trump, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: So, still the same person you are talking about?

Stormy Daniels: Yes, which he did, he came to talk to me later.

Susan Necheles: "And later when he came to the gift room, he came to talk to me, he asked for my number and I give it to him." And that's still President Trump, right?

Stormy Daniels: I gave my number to his bodyguard on his behalf, yes.

Susan Necheles: Well, that's not what you said in 2011?

Stormy Daniels: I didn't specify in 2011.

Susan Necheles: Well, you haven't mentioned a bodyguard in that paragraph, have you?

Stormy Daniels: No.

Susan Necheles: The only "he" you were talking about --

Stormy Daniels: They asked me to not mention other people.

Susan Hoffinger: Can we let the witness finish.

Juan Merchan: Please.

Susan Necheles: I'm sorry.

Stormy Daniels: I'm sorry.

Juan Merchan: You can finish your answer. Do you want to hear the question again?

Stormy Daniels: Yes, sorry.

Juan Merchan: Can you read back the question.

Juan Merchan: All right. You can finish your answer.

Stormy Daniels: Okay.

Stormy Daniels: [Continuing.] They tried to get me not to mention other people when they asked me who, who ask who for whose number or whatever. But it was Keith. He was standing there. He was always with President Trump.

Susan Necheles: All right. So your testimony now is that the reporter didn't want you to mention the name Keith?

Stormy Daniels: It wasn't the reporter.

Susan Necheles: Who was it?

Stormy Daniels: My publicist. He didn't want his name mentioned.

Susan Necheles: Okay.

Susan Necheles: So if we can --

Stormy Daniels: Ex-publicist. Sorry.

Susan Necheles: If we can skip down to the last paragraph.

Susan Necheles: So you say, "I went up to the room and I was met outside by his bodyguard Keith?"

Stormy Daniels: Keith, yes.

Susan Necheles: So you mentioned Keith's name, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: But you didn't mention it in the first paragraph, right?

Stormy Daniels: Right.

Susan Necheles: In the first paragraph you were only talking about President Trump, right?

Stormy Daniels: Hmmm, it even says here, "That's how I got in touch with him. I never had Donald telephone's number. I always used Keith."

Susan Necheles: My question was: In the first paragraph, you were only talking about President Trump, right?

Stormy Daniels: No.

Susan Necheles: Well, that's the only reference --

Stormy Daniels: They were always together. Like this. [Witness indicating.]

Susan Necheles: But you didn't say that in 2011?

Stormy Daniels: When I give my number to someone and visa versa, it goes through my manager or bodyguard, anyone who has security or a handler knows that they are a unit.

Susan Necheles: Your Honor, I move to strike that.

Susan Hoffinger: It's her answer, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: Overruled.

Susan Necheles: And in your 2011 interview with In Touch Magazine, you said that -- well, you testified yesterday that when you were asked to dinner, you said, "No fucking way," right? That's what you testified on Tuesday, right?

Stormy Daniels: Correct.

Susan Necheles: But in your 2011 interview with In Touch Magazine, you said that Donald Trump himself asked if you would have dinner with him, right?

Stormy Daniels: Like I said, a bodyguard or a handler is a unit.

Susan Necheles: And --

Stormy Daniels: Someone who is speaking on your behalf is the same as being asked directly.

Susan Necheles: And you told the interviewer that you said "Of course," right?

Stormy Daniels: Uh-huh.

Susan Necheles: Right. So you said, "Then he asked me if I wanted to have dinner that night and I was like, yeah, of course," right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes. Those were the words of my publicist, actually, who said go to dinner with him. He's fascinating. What's the worst that could happen?

Susan Necheles: Well, that's what you said that you responded to President Trump that night, right?

Stormy Daniels: This is an entertainment magazine. It is very short and frivolous. And a very vast difference between someone who is a reality TV star and the President. This is an abbreviated, entertaining version of the events.

Susan Necheles: Now, you are saying that you lied in 2011 when you made this story -- when you were telling this story, right?

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Susan Necheles: Okay. You were telling the truth when you gave this story -- this interview?

Stormy Daniels: It was minus some details. It is a short interview.

Susan Necheles: And then you -- and you further told the interviewer: "Who would pass up an opportunity to talk to someone so interesting," right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And so, that's what you said in 2011, that you were happy to go to dinner with him. Immediately, you were happy to go to dinner with President Trump, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And you testified on direct examination on Tuesday that when you supposedly went to President Trump's hotel room, you thought you were going out for dinner, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: But your story is that even though you spent over three hours in the hotel room, you never got any dinner, right?

Stormy Daniels: We never got any food. It never -- we never ate, no.

Susan Necheles: And you previously said that you specifically remember this because your stomach was growling, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And you wrote in your book: "Plus I was freaking hungry. I needed a bowl of pretzels at least, if I was going to sit through this." You said: "There was going to be dinner, I thought. This monologue went on for a good 10 or 15 minutes, which is an eternity when your stomach is growling and you are hungry."

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And you are saying that this was a big deal that you didn't get dinner, right?

Stormy Daniels: I was invited. It was dinnertime. I was running hungry, yeah. We talked about ordering food or going down to get food, and we never got to eat. It was dinnertime, and we never ate.

Susan Necheles: And you made a big point of that on numerous interviews, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yeah, I went to go to dinner and I didn't get dinner.

Susan Necheles: And you gave an interview with Jimmy Kimmel, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And you said: "Actually, we never had dinner. Like, he lied to me. I'm very food motivated. That's why I stayed and held out for so long, because I was told there would be snacks. I was starving." That's what you said, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: So this was a -- this was a clear memory that you had, that you were not fed dinner and you were starving, right?

Stormy Daniels: Right. It was dinnertime. I was invited to dinner, but I never actually saw any food.

Susan Necheles: But in your 2011 interview with In Touch Magazine, you said the opposite, didn't you?

Stormy Daniels: I never said we ate.

Susan Necheles: No?

Stormy Daniels: No.

Susan Necheles: So I direct your attention --

Susan Necheles: If we could put up, again, J28.

Stormy Daniels: I remember ordering. Or asking to order.

Susan Necheles: And do you recall that you said that you had dinner with President Trump while you talked about whether he would put you on The Apprentice?

Stormy Daniels: Uh-uh. I don't have anything here.

Susan Necheles: I'm asking if you recall that?

Stormy Daniels: I don't. I need to see what I said.

Susan Necheles: All right. So I direct your attention to J28, Page 4.

Susan Necheles: Look at the bottom of the page. Do you recall being asked: "So this is all conversation while you are eating?" And you responded, "Yeah, like before, during and after. We hung out for quite awhile. A few hours at least." Right?

Stormy Daniels: What is this from? Okay.

Susan Necheles: Do you recall being asked that and giving that answer?

Stormy Daniels: I don't recall exactly, no.

Susan Necheles: Okay. Are you saying you didn't say that?

Stormy Daniels: I don't remember saying that.

Susan Necheles: And if we could direct your attention to the bottom of Page 7.

Stormy Daniels: Page 7?

Susan Necheles: And do you recall being asked, "Again, so this was all during dinner?" And you responding, "Yeah, during, after, yeah, it was definitely the biggest, longest topic of conversation."

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: "How he could get me on."

Stormy Daniels: And it was dinner. I was invited to dinner, and it was dinnertime. I maintained that I didn't see any food. We didn't go down. We never left the room to go down to dinner, like I said. My story is the same.

Susan Necheles: So you did say that, you were asked that question and you gave that answer?

Stormy Daniels: It was dinner, but we never got food.

Susan Necheles: So when, when the reporter asked you, "This was all during dinner?" You are saying, "During dinner," meaning it was dinnertime, but we didn't eat?

Stormy Daniels: Correct. I would have definitely mentioned what I ate in all of these interviews. I would have talked about the food. I'm very food motivated.

Susan Necheles: All right. And do you recall being interviewed on -- by Anderson Cooper on CNN in 2018, right?

Stormy Daniels: Do I remember doing the interview?

Susan Necheles: Yes.

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And do you recall that in that interview you again said you "had dinner that night with President Trump in the room"?

Stormy Daniels: Can I see what I said exactly?

Susan Necheles: You don't have any recollection?

Stormy Daniels: I would like to see what I said exactly.

Susan Necheles: You had testified to all of these details of -- about what the tiling of the floor was like on direct examination, but you don't recall what you said in 2018?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Susan Necheles: I will show you what is marked as J12, and directing your attention to Page 598.

Susan Necheles: Yes, directing your attention to Page 598. And in that interview, you said you had dinner in the room, right?

Stormy Daniels: It says, "Did we go out for dinner? No, you had dinner in the room? Yes. And then I know that I went on to explain that I didn't actually ever get to eat dinner. You are showing one sentence of an entire conversation.

Susan Necheles: You say that in this interview you said that you -- well, so isn't it correct that Anderson Cooper said to you: "ANDERSON COOPER: Did you two go out for dinner that night?" "STORMY DANIELS: No." "ANDERSON COOPER: You had dinner in the room?" "STORMY DANIELS: Yes." That was the conversation, right?

Stormy Daniels: Where is the rest of the conversation?

Susan Necheles: And he said: "What happened next?" Right?

Stormy Daniels: Uh-huh.

Susan Necheles: That was the conversation about dinner, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes. Where we don't talk about receiving food. What I ate. Which I definitely would have talked about.

Susan Necheles: Okay. But you said you had dinner in the room, right?

Stormy Daniels: I went up to his room to have dinner, yes. We did not have any food. And I did not eat any food.

Susan Necheles: Okay. So --

Stormy Daniels: And I have maintained that in every interview, that I never actually got my food.

Susan Necheles: And you are saying --

Stormy Daniels: That has not changed.

Susan Necheles: So you are saying, like, when you said to Anderson Cooper that you had dinner in the room, you really didn't mean that you had dinner, you meant something else, right?

Stormy Daniels: We had dinnertime in the room.

Susan Necheles: Your words don't mean what you say, do they?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Susan Necheles: And you testified on Tuesday that you and President Trump were staying in different hotels, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: He was staying at The Harrah's Hotel?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And you were staying at The Harvey Hotel, right?

Stormy Daniels: I don't remember.

Susan Necheles: Well, The Harvey Hotel was -- you understood that The Harvey Hotel and The Harrah's Hotel had a common owner, right?

Stormy Daniels: What?

Susan Necheles: They had common ownership?

Stormy Daniels: I did not know.

Susan Necheles: Well, that's where the events were taking place in the golf tournament, right?

Stormy Daniels: I didn't know.

Susan Necheles: And they are located one block away from each other, right?

Stormy Daniels: I don't remember.

Susan Necheles: And so it was your testimony on direct that you walked and then took a car to go one block?

Stormy Daniels: Uh-huh. I went to a tattoo studio shop first to see my friends. And I was wearing heels, and so I took a car the rest of the way.

Susan Necheles: Okay. And the tattoo studio was two blocks away, right?

Stormy Daniels: I don't remember.

Susan Necheles: And isn't it a fact that you -- when you gave an interview to In Touch Magazine in 2011, you said that you remember walking from your hotel to his hotel?

Stormy Daniels: I don't remember exactly. Like I said, it was an abbreviated interview. I did make a stop at a tattoo shop for like an hour.

Susan Necheles: Okay. I will show you what has been marked as J28.

Susan Necheles: And, by the way, this abbreviated interview is 29 pages long, right?

Stormy Daniels: I don't know. I mean, there are photos. And who knows.

Susan Necheles: And directing your attention to Page 4, the bottom paragraph.

Stormy Daniels: Uh-huh. From --

Susan Necheles: Well, I want to direct your attention to the top part of this. Just going back a minute. Let's see. 1, 2, 3, 4, five lines from the top. Do you recall saying during that interview: "We ended up having dinner in the room. I cannot remember what we ordered. I remember what I had the second time I had dinner with him, but I can't remember what we had." Do you recall saying that?

Stormy Daniels: Hang on.

Susan Necheles: You said that in that interview, didn't you, Ms. Daniels?

Stormy Daniels: Yeah. It says, "I don't remember ordering anything or what I ordered, if anything."

Susan Necheles: But you say twice there: "We had dinner in the room." Right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes. Like I said, it was dinnertime in the room.

Susan Necheles: So you are saying that when you said "we had dinner," you did not mean that, right?

Stormy Daniels: I'm saying a -- once again, I had dinner in his room, but we never got our food. And I never ate anything.

Susan Necheles: Okay.

Stormy Daniels: Having dinner with somebody, at least where I'm from, doesn't necessarily mean that you have to put food in your mouth. I'm going to someone's house for dinner. It's dinnertime.

Susan Necheles: And isn't it a fact that when you wrote your book, you said you walked from your hotel to President Trump's hotel?

Stormy Daniels: I walked halfway there or I -- actually, I think I went in the opposite direction first.

Susan Necheles: And you don't say anything in your book about taking a car, right?

Stormy Daniels: I don't remember exactly.

Susan Necheles: But when you were interviewed by the Prosecutors in this case, the first time, you told them that President Trump's bodyguard sent a car to pick you up and take you to the room, didn't you?

Stormy Daniels: I don't know how the car got there or who sent it specifically. I have no way of knowing who I was speaking to, who -- or who sent the car.

Susan Necheles: Well, when you testified on Tuesday, you said that you called a car -- you said you walked and then you said you called a car?

Stormy Daniels: I called for a car? I don't know how the car was called. I told them that I was going -- that I needed a car. I don't know if they called the car. I don't remember. I know it was before Uber, obviously.

Susan Necheles: The details of your story keep changing, right?

Stormy Daniels: No. I took a car from the tattoo shop to his hotel.

Susan Necheles: Okay. And you testified on direct examination that when you supposedly entered the suite, that President Trump came from the main area of the hotel suite and met you in the foyer, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And you say that there were -- the elevator -- no, withdrawn. But when you were interviewed for -- in 2011, for In Touch Magazine, you said that when you walked into the hotel suite, President Trump was all sprawled out on the couch watching television or something, right?

Stormy Daniels: I don't remember saying that.

Susan Necheles: Well, if you could look at J28. And directing your attention to Page 4.

Susan Necheles: Do you recall -- well, let's start at the bottom of Page 3.

Susan Necheles: You said: "I went in, and I was all dressed up, because I had just assumed that we were going to go to dinner, but he meant to have dinner in his room. Like, he wasn't dressed." And then if I could direct your attention to Page 4. "To go out at all. Just lounging. I remember taking a jab at him. I remember saying because he was all sprawled out on the couch watching television or something.

Susan Necheles: And he was wearing pajama pants." Do you remember saying that?

Stormy Daniels: Yes. I walked in. He was on the couch. He heard me come in. He got up and he greeted me in the foyer.

Susan Necheles: I see. So you say he was all sprawled out on the couch there, and now you are saying "but he got up." That's what you saying now?

Stormy Daniels: He did both. He greeted me from the foyer. He came from the inside from where the couches and things were, I assumed he was watching television, but he definitely wasn't getting dressed.

Susan Necheles: Okay. But you didn't say that in your 2011 interview, did you?

Stormy Daniels: No, I did not. Like I said, it was a shorter interview.

Susan Necheles: Okay. And you testified on direct --

Susan Necheles: Your Honor, is this a good time for a break?

Juan Merchan: I would like to go a little longer.

Susan Necheles: You testified on direct that after being in President Trump's hotel suite for several hours, you went to the bathroom, right?

Stormy Daniels: Correct.

Susan Necheles: And you claim when you came out of the bathroom he was on the bed in a T-shirt and boxer shorts, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: Just one minute before we get to that. I want to go back to where President Trump was when you entered the hotel suite room. Do you recall you wrote a book about this, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And do you recall that when you say, when you opened the door -- withdrawn. Let's just go back to the room. So you say you came out of the bathroom and he was on the bed in his T-shirt and boxer shorts, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And, according to you, when you saw him sitting on the bed, you became faint, the room started to spin and the blood left your hands and feet, yes?

Stormy Daniels: Yes. It was shock. Surprise.

Susan Necheles: So just so I can be clear on what you are saying, you've acted and had sex in over 200 porn movies, right?

Stormy Daniels: 150-ish, yes.

Susan Necheles: And there are naked men and naked women having sex, including yourself in those movies, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And, but according to you, seeing a man sitting on a bed, in a T-shirt and boxer shorts, was so upsetting that you got light headed, blood left your hands and feet, and you almost fainted, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes. When you are not expecting a man twice your age to be in their underwear -- I have seen my husband naked almost everyday -- if I came out of the bathroom and it was not my husband and it was Mr. Trump on the bed, I would probably have the same reaction.

Susan Necheles: And that made you feel like you were going to faint?

Stormy Daniels: Absolutely. If I came out of the bathroom and saw an older man in his underwear that I wasn't expecting seeing there, yeah.

Susan Necheles: And, according to you, earlier that evening, you had been bossing President Trump around and telling him to change his clothes out of pajamas and to stop talking about himself, right?

Stormy Daniels: That was hours before, yeah, I was in -- I guess it was seeing a man in his underwear that you are not expecting to be there, when you are not expecting him to be there.

Susan Necheles: And you were a pretty assertive woman, right?

Stormy Daniels: More so now.

Susan Necheles: Well, you have been working since you were 18, right?

Stormy Daniels: Seventeen.

Susan Necheles: Seventeen. And you've had to take care of yourself, you said, since you were 17, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Necheles: And some of the places you were working in are pretty tough places to work in, right?

Stormy Daniels: Sometimes.

Susan Necheles: And you have taken care of yourself that whole time, right?

Stormy Daniels: Mostly, yes.

Susan Necheles: And you said that even though he was twice your age, you had no problem bossing him around that whole day, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes. When I felt like I had control of the situation and I had an exit, and this was definitely a power shift.

Susan Necheles: Well, in your book, in fact, you wrote that "you had made him your bitch," right?

Stormy Daniels: I did earlier.

Susan Necheles: Those were your words, right, "you had made him your bitch?"

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: Right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: Because you are powerful, right?

Stormy Daniels: I used to think so.

Susan Necheles: But now, because he was supposedly in a T-shirt and boxer shorts, you were so upset that he wanted to have sex with you that you couldn't speak up and say that you didn't want to have sex with him?

Stormy Daniels: Correct.

Susan Necheles: Right?

Stormy Daniels: Correct.

Susan Necheles: The man who you claimed "I made him my bitch," but I can't say no to having sex with him supposedly, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: This was not the first time in your life someone had made a pass at you, was it?

Stormy Daniels: No.

Susan Necheles: And you testified on direct examination --

Stormy Daniels: But it was the first time that they had a bodyguard standing outside the door and they were in their underwear.

Susan Necheles: Okay --

Stormy Daniels: And they were twice my age and bigger than me.

Susan Necheles: Okay. And you understand there is no question pending?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Susan Necheles: And you testified on direct that Mr. Trump got out of bed and stood between you and the door, to the exit of the bedroom and said something like: I thought we were getting somewhere, we were talking and I thought you were serious about what you wanted, if you ever want to get out of that trailer park. Those were his words that you said that he said?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And you said you blacked out and the next thing you remember was being on the bed and having sex, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: But when you were interviewed in 2011 by In Touch Magazine, you told a completely different story, didn't you?

Stormy Daniels: No.

Susan Necheles: Well, when you were interviewed in 2011, you said that when you came out of the bathroom, Donald Trump was sitting on the bed and he said, "Come here." And you were like, "Oh, here we go." And then you started kissing and had sex. That's the story that you told in 2011, isn't it?

Stormy Daniels: Like I said, there were parts in the middle that I didn't remember.

Susan Necheles: Well, isn't that the story that you told in 2011, right?

Stormy Daniels: I don't remember exactly what I said.

Susan Necheles: Okay. I'm going to direct your attention to J28, Page 8.

Stormy Daniels: Uh-huh. QAnd do you recall saying, "I had to use the bathroom. And I went to the restroom, which was in the bedroom. Like I said, it was a big suite. I could describe the suite perfectly when I came out. He was sitting on the bed and he was like, 'come here.' And I was like, 'Oh, here we go.' And we started kissing." "I actually don't even know why I did it, but I do remember while we were having sex I was like, please, don't try to pay me. And then I remember thinking, but if I did -- but if he did, I bet -- no, but, I bet if he did, it would be a lot." That's what you said to In Touch Magazine in 2011, right?

Stormy Daniels: Correct. Yes, because I wasn't trying to get money, and he did say, "Come here."

Susan Necheles: Nothing about him standing up, right?

Stormy Daniels: No. I didn't -- I mean, it's not here. This was an abbreviated article. But he did stand up. And he was between me and the door, and Keith was outside the door. And then I don't remember -- and then I remember we were kissing and he was on top of me. That's what I remember. I --

Susan Necheles: You remember what you said to -- withdrawn.

Juan Merchan: We can only have one person speaking at a time.

Susan Necheles: So what you said to In Touch Magazine was: "We started kissing." Right?

Stormy Daniels: Uh-huh, yes.

Susan Necheles: Nothing about him standing up, right?

Stormy Daniels: But it also doesn't say that I got on the bed. This is an abbreviated version. He stood up. We started kissing. It has been edited for clearing.

Susan Necheles: It doesn't say he stood up, did it?

Stormy Daniels: No, it doesn't say that he stood up either.

Susan Necheles: You said that he said, "Come here," right?

Stormy Daniels: He did, he said, "Come here."

Susan Necheles: Meaning you should come to the bed?

Stormy Daniels: He stood up and said, "Come here."

Susan Necheles: It doesn't say that, does it?

Stormy Daniels: No, it doesn't.

Susan Necheles: And then you said, "We started kissing." Right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: Nothing about if you want to get what you want to get, you better go along with this, right?

Stormy Daniels: They left out a lot of stuff because they couldn't fact-check it. I do remember them telling me that.

Susan Necheles: And nothing about a trailer park, right?

Stormy Daniels: No.

Susan Necheles: And you made that -- you have made all of this up, right?

Stormy Daniels: No.

Susan Necheles: And, by the way, you weren't drinking anything that night?

Stormy Daniels: Just water.

Susan Necheles: No drugs, right?

Stormy Daniels: Absolutely no.

Susan Necheles: But you supposedly, you blacked out, right?

Stormy Daniels: I got lightheaded. I never blacked out. I didn't, like, hit the floor. I just -- everything spun and went black. But, no, I was not given any drugs. I did not take any drugs. And there was -- I don't even believe there was alcohol in the room.

Susan Necheles: And, in 2011, you said that you were fascinated and stimulated by President Trump and had really good banter and that you could tell he was a nice, intelligent -- he was nice, intelligent in conversation. Right?

Stormy Daniels: It was a nice, intelligent conversation, yes.

Susan Necheles: That's what you said, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And nothing about him threatening you with a trailer park, right?

Stormy Daniels: That was after I came out of the bathroom. There was no more conversation. The conversation was intelligent and interesting. I enjoyed it.

Susan Necheles: And you were interviewed for Slate Magazine by Mr. Weisberg in 2018, right?

Stormy Daniels: I'm not sure that was his name.

Susan Necheles: Okay. Let me show you J45. Q It was a 2018 interview by Jacob Weisberg, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes. That's what it says.

Susan Necheles: And this story gets published right after the Wall Street Journal article, right?

Stormy Daniels: I believe so, yes. January 16th.

Susan Necheles: The Wall Street Journal article, you recall, was on January 12th?

Stormy Daniels: January 12th. Yes, ma'am.

Susan Necheles: On January 12th 2018. And this was on January 16th to 18, is that right?

Stormy Daniels: That's what it says.

Susan Necheles: And am I correct that you told Mr. Weisberg that there was no abuse in what happened with President Trump and that you were not a victim, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And this is what you were saying in 2018, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And you said that the worst that Trump had done was break promises you never believed that he would fulfill, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And you told Weisberg that President Trump offered to buy you a condom in Tampa, Florida, and that he wanted to feature you as a contestant on an upcoming season of The Celebrity Apprentice, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: You didn't say anything to Mr. Weisberg about you supposedly blacking out or not remembering how you ended up in bed, right?

Stormy Daniels: Correct.

Susan Necheles: You said the worst thing he did was he didn't give you a condom, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes, I never wanted a condom.

Susan Necheles: Oh, you didn't want a condom?

Stormy Daniels: No, not in Tampa, Florida.

Susan Necheles: Well, you said the worst thing he did was he didn't put you on The Celebrity Apprentice, right?

Stormy Daniels: I said the worst thing he did was that he lied.

Susan Necheles: And you said nothing about a power imbalance or that you were scared that there was a bodyguard standing outside of the door, right?

Stormy Daniels: No. I said the worst thing that he did was lie. That's my feelings.

Susan Necheles: Okay. And you were also --

Stormy Daniels: I blame myself --

Susan Necheles: And you didn't say anything about --

Stormy Daniels: -- for feeling that way.

Susan Necheles: And you didn't say anything about feeling those things that you just described happened?

Susan Hoffinger: Can you please let the witness finish, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: Overruled. I think she was done. Overruled.

Stormy Daniels: And, I'm sorry, what did you say?

Susan Necheles: You didn't say anything about feeling faint in there, when this happened, right?

Stormy Daniels: No. Because the question was what Mr. Trump did. And Mr. Trump did not drug me. And he did not -- that was how I felt, the worst thing that he did was lie in that moment.

Susan Necheles: Right. And you were also interviewed by Vogue Magazine in 2018, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And isn't it correct that you were asked: "Did Trump do something that made you feel like you had to have sex with him?" And you responded, "No, nothing," right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And so, in 2018, you said that there was nothing that he did that made you feel like you -- that you had to have sex with him, but on Tuesday, on direct exam, you testified that he made nasty comments and stood over you and you felt a power shift, right?

Stormy Daniels: I never said he stood over me. He stood in front of me. I was not below him or on the floor.

Susan Necheles: So you were saying, when you testified on Tuesday, that his actions made you feel like you had to have sex with him, right?

Stormy Daniels: My own insecurities made me feel that way. I have maintained that he has not -- he did not put his hands on me. He did not give me any sort of drugs or alcohol, and he did not hold a weapon or hold me at any sort of -- threaten me with any short of an item. And I have said that, and I maintain that. I was not physically threatened or drugged or drunk.

Susan Necheles: But these nasty -- supposed nasty comments that he made and standing up over you, those statements were not what you were saying in 2018, right?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Overruled. You can answer.

Stormy Daniels: Those statements are exactly what I said.

Susan Necheles: You said --

Stormy Daniels: He said that he thought that I was on the same page about going onto the television show. That is exactly what it was --

Susan Necheles: In 2018 --

Stormy Daniels: -- he lied about that and stood in front of me and he never had any intention of --

Susan Necheles: My question to you is just: In 2018, you didn't say any of that to anybody, did you?

Stormy Daniels: Which part? That he stood in front of me and said I thought you wanted to prove that you could do this? That's exactly what he said.

Susan Necheles: You didn't say that in the Kold article, right, when I asked you about whether you said that to anybody? Do you understand my question?

Stormy Daniels: No, I don't.

Susan Necheles: Okay. In 2018, you didn't tell the Kold writer that President Trump had supposedly said that to you, did you?

Stormy Daniels: I said that he promised me a part in The Celebrity Apprentice. He thought that I was intelligent and would do whatever it takes. My own insecurities in that moment kept me from saying no.

Susan Necheles: You didn't say that --

Stormy Daniels: I have maintained that he did not physically threaten me in any way.

Susan Necheles: Okay. You claim that that's in the article, in the Kold article?

Stormy Daniels: I don't know what's in the Kold article, but my story hasn't changed.

Susan Necheles: You didn't say that then, did you?

Stormy Daniels: I don't know.

Susan Necheles: And, now, in 2024, your story has changed, hasn't it?

Stormy Daniels: No. Not at all. You are trying to make me say that it changed, but it hasn't changed.

Susan Necheles: And I want to talk about the night after the evening that you claim that you had sex with President Trump. So the American Century Championship, which was a Golf Celebrity Tournament which had celebrities in both hotels, and so they had parties and events, right?

Stormy Daniels: Several, yeah.

Susan Necheles: And, in fact, you testified that many of the parties were in your hotel, right?

Stormy Daniels: I don't know which parties were part of the event and not, but there were parties in both hotels.

Susan Necheles: Well, you testified --

Stormy Daniels: I have no way of knowing which parties were sanctioned for that.

Susan Necheles: You testified that there was an auction in your hotel of celebrity items, there were a couple of auctions, yeah? And you said that there was a nightclub in the hotel?

Stormy Daniels: Bar, restaurant, nightclub things, yeah.

Susan Necheles: And you testified that -- well, you have said that President Trump called you from his bodyguard's phone and invited you to come have drinks with him at the nightclub downstairs in the hotel that night, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes, I said yes.

Susan Necheles: And you said you met him in the VIP area, and that Trump was there and Ben Roethlisberger and Keith Schiller were there?

Stormy Daniels: He was sitting in a booth.

Susan Necheles: With Roethlisberger?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And while you were there, you talked -- and you went and talked with them, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And while you were there, you talked about The Apprentice, right?

Stormy Daniels: Very briefly, yes.

Susan Necheles: And you testified on direct that that conversation or that encounter lasted for about ten minutes, right?

Stormy Daniels: I would say so.

Susan Necheles: But in your book you said you were there for about an hour, right?

Stormy Daniels: The conversation -- Mr. Trump left first. He was there for like maybe 10 or 15 minutes.

Susan Necheles: Well, in your book didn't you say it was "max an hour?"

Stormy Daniels: "Max an hour," yeah.

Susan Necheles: And President Trump then left you alone with Roethlisberger, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And you said that at that point you really believed that President Trump wanted to put you on The Celebrity Apprentice, correct?

Stormy Daniels: I did at that time, yes.

Susan Necheles: And you -- and that was because of that conversation, right?

Stormy Daniels: Which conversation?

Susan Necheles: Well, the conversation in that nightclub, that was one of the conversations, right?

Stormy Daniels: That was one of them, yeah.

Susan Necheles: And then there were other conversations on the phone as well, right, about that?

Stormy Daniels: I only had two conversations by the time, at that incident which was in the nightclub, the one the night before and the one sitting in that moment.

Susan Necheles: Okay.

Stormy Daniels: So based on those two conversations, yes.

Susan Necheles: And you had other conversations later --

Stormy Daniels: Later.

Susan Necheles: And you said -- you told Jimmy Kimmel, in fact, didn't you, that you thought that President Trump thought that it would be great for the ratings, right?

Stormy Daniels: Uh-huh.

Susan Necheles: And that's what your discussions were with him, right?

Stormy Daniels: That's what he told me, yes.

Susan Necheles: And that's what you talked about in your phone calls with President Trump, right?

Stormy Daniels: Partially, yes.

Susan Necheles: And he also talked about that when you went to Trump Tower, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And, by the way, you took a selfie of yourself and your friend in his office in Trump Towers, right?

Stormy Daniels: Well, my friend did.

Susan Necheles: And that was in 2007, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: But you have no other pictures with President Trump other than that one picture?

Stormy Daniels: Right.

Susan Necheles: With her?

Stormy Daniels: We took a picture with him at the Trump Vodka Party and in his office.

Susan Necheles: And in his office?

Stormy Daniels: I didn't physically take them, my friends did.

Susan Necheles: The Trump Vodka Party was a party where he invited lots of minor celebrities, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And that was all public, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And then you also went to -- you asked to be -- for tickets to the Miss USA Pageant, right?

Stormy Daniels: I'm sorry. What was that?

Susan Necheles: You also asked for tickets to the Miss USA Beauty Pageant, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And you went with your agent too, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes. I went with my agent.

Susan Necheles: And that was also in public, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes, but I did not speak with him there.

Juan Merchan: Miss Necheles, would you like to take a break?

Susan Necheles: Yes.

Juan Merchan: All right. Jurors, let's go ahead and take our morning break. Let's take about 15 minutes. You can step out.

Court Officer: Leave your notepads. All rise.

Juan Merchan: You can step down. Thank you.

Stormy Daniels: Thank you.

Juan Merchan: People, counsel, is there anything that we need to discuss?

Joshua Steinglass: No.

Susan Necheles: No.

Juan Merchan: All right. I will see you in about 15 minutes.

Court Clerk: Case on trial continued. All jurors are present and properly seated.

Juan Merchan: Ms. Necheles.

Susan Necheles: Thank you, Your Honor.

Note: [Continued direct examination by Susan Necheles.]

Susan Necheles: Ms. Daniels, before we took the break, we were talking about you being at a nightclub with President Trump and Ben Roethlisberger, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes, ma'am.

Susan Necheles: And at some point President Trump left, and he left you alone with Ben Roethlisberger, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And you testified on your cross-examination, just a little while ago, I was asking questions about Make America Horny Tour, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And you said you hated that name, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And that you never posted it yourself, right?

Stormy Daniels: I never made any of those flyers.

Susan Necheles: And you never posted it on your social media you testified, right?

Stormy Daniels: Sometimes they made me re-tweet them, but I never made any of the flyers and posted them on my own accord.

Susan Necheles: You said sometimes you may have had to re-tweet them but that's it, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yeah. As a matter of fact, I fired a webmaster for posting them.

Susan Necheles: I want to direct your attention to -- showing you what has been marked as J-49. Susan --

Note: [Whereupon, the District Attorneys were shown a document.]

Susan Necheles: Do you recognize that as coming from your Instagram account?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: I will offer that in evidence, your Honor.

Susan Hoffinger: No objection.

Juan Merchan: Accepted into evidence.

Susan Necheles: And that's posted on your Instagram account, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes. It was reposted from Deja Vu.

Susan Necheles: And that was February 2nd, 2018, is that correct?

Stormy Daniels: February 24th -- oh, sorry. Yes.

Susan Necheles: And there is a picture of you and that you are going to be somewhere on February 24th, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And it says, Stormy Daniels Performing Live, Make America Horny Again 2018 Tour, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And that's you posing for that picture, right?

Stormy Daniels: Well, it's a flier made up of a photo that I posed for.

Susan Necheles: And you posted that on your personal Instagram, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes. That's not my personal Instagram. That's my business Instagram.

Susan Necheles: And I want to direct your attention now to J-50, which is just for the witness and the parties. Do you recognize that as being another post from your Instagram?

Stormy Daniels: Yes. That was the very first one.

Susan Necheles: And I offer that in evidence, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: Any objections?

Susan Hoffinger: No objections.

Juan Merchan: Accepted into evidence.

Susan Necheles: And that posted on January 14, 2018, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And it says, Stormy Daniels, the Making America Horny Again Tour, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And you posted that on your personal Instagram, right?

Stormy Daniels: That's my public Instagram.

Susan Necheles: Your public Instagram, right? And you said, see you soon South Carolina, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And those are just two of many that you posted, right?

Stormy Daniels: I don't know.

Susan Necheles: But you were advertising for that tour, right?

Stormy Daniels: For my appearances, yes.

Susan Necheles: And making money off of that?

Stormy Daniels: That's what you do with tours.

Susan Necheles: And turning your attention back to the tournament, the celebrity golf tournament, President Trump was the biggest celebrity, probably, at that tournament, right?

Stormy Daniels: It depends on what you are a fan of.

Susan Necheles: Well, people recognized him, right?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Susan Necheles: Well, you saw people following him around, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes. A lot of people are paid to follow him around I am sure. I don't know.

Susan Necheles: And he did very well at that golf tournament, right?

Stormy Daniels: I don't remember.

Susan Necheles: He was playing golf himself?

Stormy Daniels: He was playing golf. I don't remember what the scores were.

Susan Necheles: And so, when -- when you saw that -- when he went -- where he went, people were recognizing who he was, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes, but --

Susan Necheles: You recognized that --

Stormy Daniels: They recognized me where I went that day too.

Susan Necheles: Okay. And, according to you, when you went up to his hotel suite, there were double doors to the outside of the hotel, before you got into the suite, right?

Stormy Daniels: From the exterior, you mean the hallway?

Susan Necheles: Yes.

Stormy Daniels: Yes. There was a door that was cracked. One door was open, but there was a second wider door.

Susan Necheles: And so, you said Keith Schiller was standing outside of the hotel suite, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes. He was leaning against the wall by the door.

Susan Necheles: And when you went in there was another -- there was a door to the bedroom, right?

Stormy Daniels: The door to the bedroom was quite a ways away.

Susan Necheles: What was that?

Stormy Daniels: Really far away.

Susan Necheles: Okay. So when you went into the bedroom, it was very far away from where Keith Schiller was, right?

Stormy Daniels: I don't know where he was at that point in time.

Susan Necheles: You didn't see him inside the suite, did you?

Stormy Daniels: I never saw him inside, no, ma'am.

Susan Necheles: So you were in the bedroom, and the door to the bedroom was closed?

Stormy Daniels: No.

Susan Necheles: The door to the bedroom was open, but it was very far away from where the front door was?

Stormy Daniels: All the doors were open.

Susan Necheles: The bedroom was very far away from the front door you just said?

Stormy Daniels: It was off of the living room, yes.

Susan Necheles: And you claimed that one of the things that made you feel uncomfortable or feel like you couldn't walk out was that Keith Schiller was standing outside of the --

Susan Hoffinger: Objection. That's not the testimony.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Susan Necheles: Well, was that your testimony, that you were -- one of the things that went through your mind about why you couldn't just leave was because Keith Schiller was outside the hotel suite?

Stormy Daniels: Absolutely. I would have had to pass by him and get to an elevator and wait for an elevator, and he was a very large man.

Susan Necheles: Well, do you recall being interviewed by Vogue magazine in 2018?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And do you recall saying to their -- you were asked, did Trump do something that made you feel like you had to have sex with him? And you being emphatic, no. Nothing. Not once did I ever feel like I was in any sort of physical danger. I am sure if I had taken off running, he wouldn't have given chase, and even if I had, there is no way that he could have caught me. Do you recall saying that?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: You didn't mention anything, but, oh, there was a bodyguard outside the door, did you?

Stormy Daniels: I don't remember if I did or not. I don't control what parts of quotes they put in magazines and how many details they use. Vogue is an entertainment magazine and it is a fashion magazine. Sometimes I give too many details.

Susan Necheles: So you last spoke with President Trump in 2007, correct?

Stormy Daniels: Well, the last time, is that what you said?

Susan Necheles: Yes.

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And it was a long time ago, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes, non.

Susan Necheles: And you never spoke with President Trump in connection with your being paid $130,000 to sell the story, did you?

Stormy Daniels: No.

Susan Necheles: So you have no personal knowledge about his involvement in that transaction, or what he did, do you?

Stormy Daniels: Not directly, no.

Susan Necheles: And am I correct that you signed the Non-Disclosure Agreement in this case with legal advice?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And you did not negotiate that Non-Disclosure Agreement with President Trump, did you?

Stormy Daniels: Not directly, my attorney.

Susan Necheles: And your lawyer dealt with Michael Cohen, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And Mr. Cohen paid you, not Mr. Trump, right?

Stormy Daniels: Actually, my attorney paid me.

Susan Necheles: Okay. But you understand that the money came from Michael Cohen, right?

Stormy Daniels: I know the --

Susan Hoffinger: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Overruled. You can answer.

Stormy Daniels: I know that the money was wired to me from Keith Davidson.

Susan Necheles: Okay. And did you understand that the money was wired to Keith Davidson?

Stormy Daniels: That's what I understood, but I have no proof.

Susan Necheles: Okay. Then you understand that in this case President Trump is charged with a crime for how the payment reimbursing Mr. Cohen was labeled on President Trump's books, you understand that, right?

Stormy Daniels: I am not an attorney. I don't really understand. I am just here to answer the questions that are asked to me about specific things that I have knowledge of.

Susan Necheles: Okay. Even though you tweeted and celebrated about him being indicted, you have no knowledge of what he was indicted for?

Stormy Daniels: There was a lot of indictments.

Susan Necheles: Your Honor, I move to strike that.

Susan Hoffinger: It is responsive, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: It's responsive. Overruled.

Note: [Continued direct examination by Susan Necheles.]

Susan Necheles: Okay. You don't know what he was indicted for in this case? You don't have any idea?

Stormy Daniels: Business records.

Susan Necheles: And you know nothing about the business records, right?

Stormy Daniels: I know nothing about his business records, no. Why would I?

Susan Necheles: You know nothing about what he does, or does not know about the business records, right?

Stormy Daniels: No.

Susan Necheles: And, Ms. Daniels, you have changed your story many times. And isn't it a fact that the reason you changed your story many times is because you never had an affair with President Trump, but realized that you could earn money by saying you had an affair, and you have been doing that for 12 years?

Susan Hoffinger: Objection to the form.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Susan Necheles: I have no further questions.

Juan Merchan: Any redirect?

Susan Hoffinger: Yes, I do. Actually, Judge, may we approach for a moment?

Juan Merchan: Yes.

Note: [Discussion is held at sidebar, on the record.]

Susan Hoffinger: Judge, I want to be careful, given your prior rulings. There are two exhibits I would like to put in, Defense Exhibits, Ms. Necheles. J-2 and J-17, they are specifically tweets that you -- she elicited that Ms. Daniels wrote and put on her Twitter. But Ms. Necheles did not elicit the tweets to which she was responding, which are both threatening.

Susan Hoffinger: For example, J-2, she specifically asked about it. It was responsive to a threat that she received on that. In fact, the witness answered that, but Ms. Necheles did not put it in evidence. And so, frankly, we feel that the jury needs to have the full context on those. I would like to admit one of them. On the second one, I would like to at least elicit a question about what her tweet was in response to. Certainly, your Honor has ruled that these types of threats can be elicited in a proper context.

Susan Hoffinger: They have cross-examined throughly on the fact that, one, it attempts to undermine the threat in 2018 in the parking lot. These are in some ways corroborative of that. Second, they have cross-examined extensively about the fact that she was only doing all of this to make money, and even her testimony here, and her story is all about money, undermining the fact that there are other issues that have arisen in terms of the threats, and that her whole reason to testify here is not purely about money and that there have been other costs.

Susan Hoffinger: In fact, Ms. Necheles asked about that, and specifically about the money she made, all the money that she had made off of this.

Susan Necheles: Can I see it, the exhibit?

Susan Hoffinger: It's J-2 and J-17. Susan, I don't have a copy for you. It was yours. Here is J-2 and then here is J-17.

Susan Necheles: Thank you.

Susan Hoffinger: We would like to elicit those. This one here, defense counsel can't use it as both a sword and shield. You can't fully -- you can't elicit only what Ms. Daniels said and not show what it is responsive to.

Juan Merchan: Is there any objection?

Susan Necheles: Your Honor, I don't have a problem eliciting that it is a response to a threat. I think that they are not statements that are made by President Trump. They are statements that are made by some stranger, you know, and she is just --

Juan Merchan: Does that matter? I don't think that matters. You did go into these a little bit, and you left the jury with a certain impression. I think it's only fair that the jury should have the full picture of what we are talking about. I am going to allow it.

Susan Hoffinger: In addition, I am going to seek to show what's already in evidence, which is People's 408-B from May of 2024, which we didn't display that says, if you come after me, I am going after you. Now, with this witness, given the cross-examination that we have heard, I would like to elicit what, if any, affect it has had on her, and what, if anything, being involved in this case and telling her account, what the affect has been on her family, the economical costs and in terms of other costs.

Susan Hoffinger: And I think the door has not only been open, but the door has been flung wide open at this point.

Joshua Steinglass: August of 2023.

Susan Necheles: We object to that. That would be so highly prejudicial. We asked about what she wrote and the money she made. Now, they want to put into evidence a tweet that has nothing to do with her. It had nothing to do with her. They are insinuating it had something to do with her, things strangers have done.

Juan Merchan: You did a very effective job on your cross-examination of calling into question her motivation. That, specifically, you have left the jury with the impression again, you did a good job -- that she is doing all of this for money. She sold her story for money. I think it's fair for the People to try to demonstrate that she has suffered injuries as a result of that and what they look like.

Juan Merchan: I will allow it.

Susan Hoffinger: Thank you, your Honor.

Note: [Discussion at sidebar concluded, and the following occurred in open court.]

Note: [Redirect examination by Susan Hoffinger.]

Susan Hoffinger: Almost good afternoon, Ms. Daniels. How are you?

Stormy Daniels: Good.

Susan Hoffinger: Defense counsel asked you quite a lot of questions yesterday, and perhaps today as well, questioning whether fear was any part of your motivation in entering into the NDA. Do you remember any of those questions?

Susan Necheles: Objection, your Honor. Those weren't my questions.

Juan Merchan: Overruled.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, you said in response to questions from defense counsel that you entered into the NDA because of advice from an attorney. Do you remember that?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And that your attorney friend said something to you about hiding in plain view?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Can you explain that a little bit, what that term meant, hiding in plain view? What your understanding is, briefly?

Stormy Daniels: And it was not the attorney who was representing me. This is a friend who was just trying to give me advice. And his friends in the military used the term, get high, stay high. And it just means, if you are out in the open, you are safer, hiding in plain sight, being out in the open. That something won't happen to you if everyone is looking at you.

Susan Hoffinger: Okay. And so, part of your motivation to enter into the NDA was to make sure this was all documented to keep you safe?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And you were also happy to take the money, you are not saying that you were not happy to take the money, right?

Stormy Daniels: No. We are all happy to take money. It was just a bonus.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, there was a question today, Ms. Necheles showed you the NDA, and she walked you through a lot of the legal language in that document. Do you recall that?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And that was a document that you hadn't prepared yourself, right?

Stormy Daniels: No.

Susan Hoffinger: And some of it is hard for you to understand?

Stormy Daniels: Yeah.

Susan Hoffinger: There was no lawsuit pending at the time, right? Did you threaten to sue Mr. Trump or no?

Stormy Daniels: No.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, defense counsel on Tuesday, two days ago, asked you to read some texts between yourself -- withdrawn. Asked you to read some texts between Gina Rodriguez and someone whose name was Dylan, who you mentioned you didn't know. Do you remember that?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And those texts were from June 28, 2016. Do you remember that?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And she had you read from some texts --

Susan Hoffinger: Let's put up People's 171-A, please, in evidence. And can you pull up, please, the box where Dylan says, I thought she denounced it previously.

Susan Hoffinger: Do you see that box?

Susan Hoffinger: And then the two boxes below that. Maybe you can highlight the two boxes below that. These were from June 28th of 2016. I am sorry. Let's do it one box at a time.

Susan Hoffinger: You see the box, I think it's ending in -- it says, Fox 38904, I have her. Do you see that box? And do you remember she asked you to read the box that says, I have her?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Put up the next box now.

Susan Hoffinger: And do you remember she asked you to read, is she ready to talk? Do you remember that?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Can you put up the next box, please?

Susan Hoffinger: And do you see, Dylan asked a question, I thought she denounced it previously? Do you remember she had you read that box?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Let's go to the next one, please.

Susan Hoffinger: And you see she asked you to read that box that said, she said she'll do it under two conditions?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, lets look at the next box. The very next box. There is a reply from Gina. Can you highlight where she said, she never did?

Susan Hoffinger: Did she ask you to read that box where she said, she never did?

Stormy Daniels: I don't think so.

Susan Hoffinger: You can take that down. Now, defense counsel asked you a lot of questions about the In Touch article and you indicated that it was a very light article, is that right, for entertainment purposes?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And can we show just to the witness, please, and to counsel and to the Court, the second page of that page two of 29? Actually, we may not have it. It is J-28. It's a Defense Exhibit. Just for the witness and counsel and the Court, please. The next page. Could you display the next page?

Susan Hoffinger: Do you see at the bottom where it says, this interview has been lightly edited? Did you see that?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Did Ms. Necheles ask you about that?

Stormy Daniels: No.

Susan Hoffinger: Thank you.

Susan Hoffinger: You can take that down.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, Ms. Necheles also asked you a lot of questions about your 60 Minutes interview with Anderson Cooper. Do you remember that?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And she put up for you J-12. She asked you a lot of questions about it. She asked you a lot of questions about what you did and didn't say in 2018 in some interviews. Do you remember that?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And she asked you about your interview with Anderson Cooper. Now, you didn't tell every single detail to Anderson Cooper, did you?

Stormy Daniels: No.

Susan Hoffinger: But you mentioned a lot of the details in that interview with him, didn't you?

Susan Necheles: Objection to the leading, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Susan Hoffinger: Well, there was a lot of back and forth in that interview between yourself and Anderson Cooper?

Stormy Daniels: Yes. It was very long.

Susan Hoffinger: And defense counsel showed you that J-12, the 60 Minutes interview, and asked you some questions about it?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: We would offer that in evidence now, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: Any objections?

Susan Necheles: Yes, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: What's the objection.

Susan Necheles: It's hearsay, statements --

Juan Merchan: Approach.

Note: [Discussion is held at sidebar, on the record.]

Juan Merchan: What does that have to do with the interview? What is it for?

Susan Hoffinger: A prior inconsistent statement. They have spent a long time talking about all kinds of inconsistencies. The witness clearly said she didn't tell every detail. There are a lot of details in there which she told him. It is a prior consistent statement to rebut that it is a recent fabrication.

Susan Necheles: A prior consistent statement?

Susan Hoffinger: Ms. Necheles showed the article to her and asked her all sorts of questions. I am surprised she would object to it being admitted at this point.

Susan Necheles: I showed it under the clear rules that apply to prior inconsistent statements. Prior consistent statements are only admissible if they were made at the time before there was a motive for fabrication. These were made in 2008, when she is selling her story.

Juan Merchan: They are the same documents. It is the same document you used to impeach her as inconsistent.

Susan Necheles: I would rely on People v. Davis, a Court of Appeal case, which --

Juan Merchan: Direct me to it. Direct me to the relevant section.

Susan Necheles: Okay. I need Gedalia for that.

Joshua Steinglass: Do you have a copy for us?

Susan Necheles: No, I don't. And it's 44 N.Y. 2d. 269.

Joshua Steinglass: So, it starts over here. It has to be before the motive to fabricate started, and particularly this paragraph, if the Defense argue it was fabricated from the beginning.

Susan Hoffinger: Your Honor, it contextualizes the so-called inconsistency they asked about. It's unfairly giving the jury an unfair impression so it contextualizes it. It shows the entire context given that Ms. Necheles went through and asked a number of questions about what was told or not told to Anderson Cooper.

Juan Merchan: I can't read and listen to you guys at the same time.

Susan Hoffinger: I apologize. When you are done, I wanted to add one thing.

Juan Merchan: I understand what the decision says, and it does stand with what you are saying. I am asking --

Susan Hoffinger: If you are admitting it --

Juan Merchan: I haven't decided yet.

Susan Hoffinger: The question is, the motive to fabricate. They indicated her motive to fabricate was after 2008. It's more recently. It's -- the indictments -- it's going on these tours. It doesn't have to predate every motive to fabricate. She -- they brought up much later the alleged notice to fabricate.

Susan Necheles: I would say that's not correct.

Juan Merchan: I am going to run on the side of the caution and deny the application.

Joshua Steinglass: Can we bring out some of details that are consistent to rebut the inference that out of context there are these inconsistencies?

Juan Merchan: You can go back to anything that was taken out of context and address it in full context.

Susan Hoffinger: I can ask her all the things she did tell.

Juan Merchan: No. No. You can go back and address the things that were taken out of context and put them in context.

Susan Hoffinger: I should be able to ask what things she did tell him, Anderson Cooper. She didn't tell him all the details. There was a number of details that were asked and answered that she testified to here. I should be able to do exactly what Ms. Necheles did.

Susan Necheles: That's not the law.

Susan Hoffinger: I should be able to ask questions about what was told.

Juan Merchan: All right. Let's continue. Step back.

Note: [Discussion at sidebar concluded, and the following occurred in open court.]

Juan Merchan: Ms. Hoffinger, you can clarify to the extent that was discussed and to that extent only.

Note: [Continued redirect examination by Susan Hoffinger.]

Susan Hoffinger: Ms. Necheles asked about certain things that you didn't tell Anderson Cooper at the time. Do you remember that?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: But there were many things that you did tell Anderson Cooper, did you not?

Susan Necheles: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Overruled.

Susan Hoffinger: And in terms of the context, you did tell Anderson Cooper that you had sex with Mr. Trump in the hotel room?

Susan Necheles: Objection, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: Overruled.

Susan Necheles: Your Honor, I think this is not what I asked.

Juan Merchan: Overruled.

Susan Hoffinger: And you did also provide details of what happened in the room, didn't you?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And, for example, you told him that Mr. Trump told you -- never told you to keep it confidential?

Susan Necheles: Objection, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: Please approach.

Note: [Discussion is held at sidebar, on the record.]

Susan Necheles: These are none of the things I asked about. She is just going through, generally, things that are consistent with what she testified about. I never asked about this.

Susan Hoffinger: I am filling out, around Ms. Necheles' questions. I only have a few. Not every single thing.

Juan Merchan: What makes it a little bit unique is that she is not trying to use a prior consistent statement. She is using the same exact document that you used and you left the jury with a certain impression. Now, I don't want you to go full board and try to rehabilitate the prior inconsistent statements.

Susan Necheles: These are not ones I addressed. She is going to things that have nothing to do with what I addressed. I agree, if I raised an issue, if you told him the sky was blue, and I left off that on some days it was cloudy --

Juan Merchan: You did leave the impression that she left out a lot of details.

Susan Necheles: Yes. She wants to go back and say the details I never mentioned were actually things she said before and that's improper.

Susan Hoffinger: There were details.

Juan Merchan: Just go back and establish that she established a lot of details and leave it at that.

Susan Hoffinger: All right, your Honor.

Note: [Discussion at sidebar concluded, and the following occurred in open court.]

Note: [Continued redirect examination by Susan Hoffinger.]

Susan Hoffinger: So, Ms. Daniels, you did tell Anderson Cooper about a lot of the details of what happened in the room and in your other encounters with Mr. Trump, correct?

Stormy Daniels: I did.

Susan Hoffinger: I would like you, please, actually, I think we have -- I have the -- can we show J-2 just to the witness, the Court and to counsel, please.

Susan Hoffinger: So, we are showing you J-2, which is an exhibit that Ms. Necheles showed you, and asked you some questions about. Do you remember that?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And she asked you some questions about your saying, I will dance down the street when he is, quote, selected. Do you remember those questions?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And do you remember responding that you were -- you said that you were only responding and using the same words as the person who had tweeted it to you? Do you recall that?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: I offer that into evidence, your Honor.

Susan Necheles: No objection.

Juan Merchan: Accepted into evidence.

Susan Hoffinger: Can you put that up on the screen for everyone, please? Can you blowup the bottom tweet, please, meaning the first tweet.

Susan Hoffinger: Was this the tweet that you were responding to when you used the term, selected?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And in this tweet, do you know who it was who posted this tweet on your Twitter page?

Stormy Daniels: Are you asking if I know this person personally? No.

Susan Hoffinger: Did you know who the person was?

Stormy Daniels: No.

Susan Hoffinger: This is an example of people who sometimes show up and put tweets on your Twitter page?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And this person called you a disgusting degenerate prostitute?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And did this person also say, good luck walking down the streets after this?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: What you did you understand that to mean, good luck walking down the street after this?

Stormy Daniels: That I wouldn't be safe going in public anymore.

Susan Hoffinger: And did this person also tweet, no wonder Glen left you?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: What did you understand that to mean?

Stormy Daniels: There is no surprise that my daughter's father left.

Susan Hoffinger: And this tweet was dated March 21st -- sorry -- March 18th of 2023?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And then you responded to that, is that right?

Stormy Daniels: That's correct.

Susan Hoffinger: You can take that down, now. Can you now show the witness please, J-17? Just to the witness, counsel and the parties, please.

Susan Hoffinger: Do you recall Ms. Necheles showing you this tweet of yours and asking you a question about your response. Do you remember that?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And she didn't ask you at all about the original tweet that you were responding to, is that right?

Stormy Daniels: That's correct.

Susan Hoffinger: Is this another example of somebody that showed up on your Twitter page saying something about you that you responded to?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And this was back in December of 2022, is that right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And the tweet on this page that you were responding to, was -- were you responding to someone calling you an aging harlot?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Are these two tweets examples of some of the tweets that you have received from random individuals in relation to things that you have said publicly about Mr. Trump?

Stormy Daniels: Yes. These are tame actually.

Susan Hoffinger: You can take that down, now. Can we please show in evidence to everyone, People's Exhibit 408-B.

Susan Hoffinger: Ms. Daniels, this tweet by Mr. Trump was August 4th of 2023?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And were you aware of this Truth Social post from Mr. Trump when it came out?

Stormy Daniels: Yes. Sorry.

Susan Hoffinger: Who did you understand Mr. Trump was directing this to at the time?

Stormy Daniels: I wasn't sure, but I thought it was me.

Susan Hoffinger: In what way?

Stormy Daniels: Um, do you want me to read it?

Susan Hoffinger: No. You can read it.

Stormy Daniels: Okay. Because it says, if you go after me, I am coming after you, and this was right around the same time that he filed in Florida, so it seemed to be connected, but I am not sure.

Susan Hoffinger: That he filed in Florida the proceeding against you on the legal fees?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: You can take that down. Thank you.

Susan Hoffinger: By the way, defense counsel asked you some questions about whether you felt you were responsible for the charges in this case. Do you remember that?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: You didn't testify in the Grand Jury in this case, did you?

Stormy Daniels: I did not.

Susan Hoffinger: So you had nothing to do with the charges in this case initially, did you?

Stormy Daniels: I did not.

Susan Necheles: Objection, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: Overruled. I will allow.

Susan Hoffinger: I am sorry. Your answer?

Stormy Daniels: I did not.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, Ms. Necheles asked you at the end of her questioning about the fact that you didn't know anything about the business records in this case, meaning Mr. Trump's business records. Do you remember those questions?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Whether you knew anything about the repayments or the reimbursements or any of the business records. Do you remember that?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And you said you didn't know anything directly, is that right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Do you recall -- you recall the lawsuit that you filed, your lawyers filed against Mr. Trump to get out of the NDA? Do you remember that?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And do you remember that Mr. Trump was represented by counsel in that case?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: And do you recall that his attorneys, Mr. Trump's attorney, in court papers filed in June of 2018, confirmed that Donald Trump in 2017 had reimbursed Michael Cohen's company, Essential Consultants, for the 130,000 that was paid to you?

Stormy Daniels: Yes. I saw that.

Susan Hoffinger: So that was confirmed in Mr. Trump lawyer's submitted court papers, correct?

Stormy Daniels: Correct.

Susan Hoffinger: Now, defense counsel asked you a whole lot of questions regarding your making money about telling lies about Mr. Trump. Do you remember that?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Have you been telling lies about Mr. Trump or the truth about Mr. Trump?

Stormy Daniels: The truth.

Susan Hoffinger: And, now, Ms. Necheles asked you about whether your telling your account of what happened with Mr. Trump has made you money, and I think you said it also cost you a lot of money. Do you remember saying that?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Hoffinger: Can you explain that?

Stormy Daniels: I have had to higher security, take extra precautions, tutors for my daughter, had to move my daughter to a safe place to live. I had to move a couple of times. And I lost -- I didn't -- I lost -- had a judgment on automatic attorney fees because my case from the NDA was thrown out. And I appealed it, and it was dismissed again.

Stormy Daniels: So attorney's fees are automatically awarded in those kinds of instances.

Susan Hoffinger: Let me ask you a question: Ms. Daniels, on balance, has your publicly telling the truth about your experiences with Mr. Trump had a net positive or a net negative in your life?

Susan Necheles: Objection, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: Overruled.

Stormy Daniels: Negative.

Susan Hoffinger: Nothing further. Thank you.

Juan Merchan: Any recross?

Susan Necheles: Yes.

Note: [Recross-examination by Susan Necheles.]

Susan Necheles: Can we put up J-2 in evidence, now. Can you blowup the bottom part.

Susan Necheles: This is some stranger who sent a tweet to you, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And that's the kind of thing that happens on Twitter, right?

Stormy Daniels: You mean strangers?

Susan Necheles: Yes. Post nasty things?

Stormy Daniels: Of course.

Susan Necheles: Is says nasty stuff. It says, you are a disgusting, degenerate prostitute who accepts money, and then is says, to frame an innocent man, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And then at the bottom is says, POTUS will be selected by a landslide in 2024, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: It's a nasty post, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And it's from someone who politically opposed -- who is politically opposed to you, right, supporting President Trump, right?

Stormy Daniels: It appears that way.

Susan Necheles: And that's the kind of stuff that goes on Twitter?

Stormy Daniels: Among lots of things, yes.

Susan Necheles: And if we could take that down and let's look it -- wait. Put that back up for a minute. And go to your response, to her response, please.

Susan Necheles: And you say, so tiny paid me to frame him, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: It's you being nasty back?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And you sound even dumber than he does during his illiterate ramblings. You are being nasty also, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: You are calling each other names, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: At this point, a person you don't even know, you are engaged in a fight of calling each other names, right?

Stormy Daniels: I didn't call this person names.

Susan Necheles: You said, you sound dumber than he does?

Stormy Daniels: I am sorry. Yes.

Susan Necheles: And then you say, I won't walk. I will dance down the street when he is selected to go to jail, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And you engaged in these kinds of back and forths with strangers all the time, right?

Stormy Daniels: Sure.

Susan Necheles: You prided yourself in what you considered your witty answers, right?

Stormy Daniels: Uh-hum.

Susan Necheles: So, when the prosecutors put these up and talk about how people were attacking you, you were attacking them right back, right?

Stormy Daniels: I was defending myself.

Susan Necheles: And attacking them right back, right?

Stormy Daniels: I never attacked anybody first. The same with Mr. Trump, I didn't say anything negative about him until he did it to me.

Susan Necheles: And you are calling President Trump names there, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And you are calling whoever asked this Twitter, or posted this Twitter names, right?

Stormy Daniels: I said they sound dumb, as in the tweet is dumb. I stand by that.

Susan Necheles: If you can put that down and put up J-17 for the witness and the parties. And I offer this in evidence.

Susan Hoffinger: No objection.

Juan Merchan: Accepted into evidence.

Susan Necheles: We can show that.

Susan Necheles: And the prosecutors asked you about whether someone else said some nasty stuff to you again, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And they called you an aging harlot, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: Again, nasty, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And you jabbed right back at them, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And you jabbed back, and said, you are so rich that you have more money than they do, right?

Stormy Daniels: Did I say that?

Susan Necheles: Well, you said you made a million dollars and you just bought a new ranch house, right?

Stormy Daniels: I don't say I have more money than them.

Susan Necheles: You say you made a million dollars, right?

Stormy Daniels: Uh-hum.

Susan Necheles: And just paid for your new ranch, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And that's what you have been doing consistently for some time now, right?

Stormy Daniels: What's that, replying, standing up for myself on Twitter or paying my bills?

Susan Necheles: Entering into Twitter battles?

Stormy Daniels: Yes, sure. When somebody attacks me, I am going to defend myself.

Susan Necheles: We can take that down now. And if you can put up 408-B in evidence, please.

Susan Necheles: And you were just shown this by the prosecution, right?

Stormy Daniels: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And you said you thought that that was about you?

Stormy Daniels: I said I didn't know. It could be.

Susan Necheles: It doesn't mention your name, right?

Stormy Daniels: No.

Susan Necheles: And are you aware that there -- at the time that President Trump posted this, there was a Republican PAC that was going after him?

Stormy Daniels: No.

Susan Necheles: Do you know whether this had to do with that Republican PAC?

Rebecca Mangold: Now, when Mr. Trump moved to the White House, how did he get the checks he was going to sign?

Rebecca Manochio: I Fed Ex'd them.

Rebecca Mangold: And how frequently did you have to Fed Ex checks to Mr. Trump?

Rebecca Manochio: About once a week.

Rebecca Mangold: Can you describe that process in a little bit more detail for the jury? How would it get to Trump, in the first instance?

Rebecca Manochio: Deb would give me the checks in a manila folder, and I would put them in a Fed Ex envelope with a return, and I would send them out.

Rebecca Mangold: When Ms. Tarasoff gave you checks for Mr. Trump to sign, did you ever look inside the envelope?

Rebecca Manochio: No.

Rebecca Mangold: Approximately, how many checks would you send down to Washington D.C. at a time?

Rebecca Manochio: Many. A few.

Rebecca Mangold: What was the kind of standard amount or range, was it more than 50?

Rebecca Manochio: No. I don't know. Like one at a time.

Rebecca Mangold: Did you ever send more than that, if you recall?

Rebecca Manochio: It's very possible, yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Do you recall ever sending just a single check?

Rebecca Manochio: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: After getting the checks, how long did it usually take for you to send them out?

Rebecca Mangold: Did you always check to make sure the checks were signed once you got them back?

Rebecca Manochio: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Whose signature was on the checks?

Rebecca Manochio: Mr. Trump's.

Rebecca Mangold: How quickly did you usually get the return envelopes back?

Rebecca Manochio: A few days.

Rebecca Mangold: And when you got the return envelopes, did you -- if there were checks sent with backup, do you recall if the backup was still attached when the checks came back?

Rebecca Manochio: It was.

Rebecca Mangold: Were you ever informed that certain checks sent to Mr. Trump in D.C. had not been sent back up to New York?

Rebecca Manochio: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: How did that happen?

Rebecca Manochio: Deb would let me know if there was something missing.

Rebecca Mangold: And what would you do next if there was something missing?

Rebecca Manochio: I would reach out to whoever I sent them to.

Rebecca Mangold: And who would you reach out to, was that somebody in the White House?

Rebecca Manochio: Yes, Madeline.

Rebecca Mangold: Do you remember her last name?

Rebecca Manochio: Westerhout, I think.

Rebecca Mangold: And she worked in the White House?

Rebecca Manochio: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: And can you tell the jury what happened on those phone calls when a check didn't come back?

Rebecca Manochio: She would just look for it and see if she had it.

Rebecca Mangold: And what did she tell you would happen if a check was missing?

Rebecca Manochio: If it was missing, either it got lost or he had questions about it and he had to speak to someone.

Rebecca Mangold: And when you say "he," you are saying?

Rebecca Manochio: Mr. Trump.

Rebecca Mangold: He might have a question on a check that was found?

Rebecca Manochio: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: That is why he didn't send it back up?

Rebecca Manochio: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: And if he had questions, what would happen, would you question him?

Rebecca Manochio: No, that's as far as I go.

Rebecca Mangold: Would you just wait to get further instructions on what to do, if anything, with the checks?

Rebecca Manochio: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: What did you do with the checks that Mr. Trump did sign?

Rebecca Manochio: I gave them to Deborah.

Rebecca Mangold: Now, do you understand you are testifying here today, in addition to other things, as a custodian of records for The Trump Organization?

Rebecca Manochio: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Why did the previous code say D.T. and this one said A.W.?

Rebecca Manochio: I just like to switch it up.

Rebecca Mangold: And did you ever send Mr. McEntee anything other than checks for Mr. Trump to sign?

Rebecca Manochio: No.

Rebecca Mangold: So all of the Fed Ex between you and Mr. McEntee were either unsigned checks for him to sign or checks that Mr. Trump had already signed?

Rebecca Manochio: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: And what are the last four digits of the tracking ID?

Rebecca Manochio: 6548

Juan Merchan: Thank you. Ms. Necheles, can you wrap this up before lunch?

Susan Necheles: We'll take it up later.

Juan Merchan: All right, jurors, we're going to break for our luncheon recess. Remember the admonitions, including, that, please, do not discuss the case either among yourselves or with anyone else. Please try to keep an open mind as to defendant's guilt or innocence. Please do not form or express an opinion as to the defendant's guilt or innocence.

Juan Merchan: Jurors, some of you might be wondering how we're doing on scheduling. I am told by the attorneys we are on schedule or perhaps a little bit ahead of schedule. Enjoy your lunch.

Juan Merchan: You may be seated. Is there anything that needs to be addressed?

Todd Blanche: It doesn't need to be right now. We have three separate applications arising out of Ms. Daniels' testimony. One is, our renewed motion for a mistrial. The second is, a renewed motion to preclude the testimony of Ms. McDougal. The third is, regarding the Gag Order, as it relates to the witness who just testified.

Todd Blanche: I can do that now or I can do it after lunch, before the end of the day, it's up to the Court.

Juan Merchan: Can we break early with the jury at four and take it up at four.

Todd Blanche: Yes, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: Enjoy your lunch.

Note: [A-F-T-E-R-N-O-O-N S-E-S-S-I-O-N.]

Juan Merchan: Please be seated.

Court Clerk: Case on trial continued. All jurors are present and properly seated.

Juan Merchan: Jurors, one scheduling matter. We're going to break today at 4. Ms. Necheles.

Susan Necheles: Thank you, your Honor.

Note: [Cross examination by Susan Necheles.]

Susan Necheles: Good afternoon, Ms. Manochio.

Rebecca Manochio: Good morning.

Susan Necheles: We've never met, right?

Rebecca Manochio: No.

Susan Necheles: You've worked for The Trump Organization for 11 years?

Rebecca Manochio: Yes.

Susan Necheles: Does your aunt work there as well?

Rebecca Manochio: She does.

Susan Necheles: And is it a nice place to work?

Rebecca Manochio: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And you really didn't interact with President Trump?

Rebecca Manochio: No.

Susan Necheles: But you testified a lot on direct about some checks that you had sent to President Trump, right?

Rebecca Manochio: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And am I correct that President Trump was the only person who could sign his personal checks?

Rebecca Manochio: Correct.

Susan Necheles: And so, all the checks for all of his personal expenses were what were being sent to President Trump in these Fed Express packages that you were talking about?

Rebecca Manochio: Right.

Susan Necheles: It was all the checks for all of his personal expenses, right?

Rebecca Manochio: Right.

Susan Necheles: There were no business expenses that were being sent to him?

Rebecca Manochio: Correct.

Susan Necheles: Because the business expenses, once he become President, he had nothing to do with those any more, right?

Rebecca Manochio: Correct.

Susan Necheles: But the personal expenses that were being sent to him were things like his credit card payments?

Rebecca Manochio: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And expenses for his youngest daughter who was still in college?

Rebecca Manochio: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And some of his wife's expenses as well?

Rebecca Manochio: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And those were the checks that he was the only person who could sign for, right?

Rebecca Manochio: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And the business checks were being signed by either Allen Weisselberg or Don Trump Jr.?

Rebecca Manochio: Correct.

Susan Necheles: You also sent the Federal Express packages for Ivanka Trump's personal checks, right?

Rebecca Manochio: Correct.

Susan Necheles: Her personal expenses were sent down, were to be signed by her as well?

Rebecca Manochio: Correct.

Susan Necheles: Exactly the same way, right?

Rebecca Manochio: Yes.

Susan Necheles: You would send those checks in an envelope that went to Fed Ex, to people, instead of to the White House, right?

Rebecca Manochio: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And those checks were so that either Ivanka Trump or President Trump could sign them, right?

Rebecca Manochio: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And you testified that you got return envelopes back in a few days, right?

Rebecca Manochio: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And these were all personal bills that had to be paid promptly, right?

Rebecca Manochio: Yes.

Susan Necheles: So getting them back promptly was important?

Rebecca Manochio: It was.

Susan Necheles: Do you know whether it took a long time for the White House to process personal mail for President Trump and get it to him?

Rebecca Manochio: No.

Susan Necheles: You don't know about that. And do you know whether speed was the reason that these were being sent in this manner?

Rebecca Mangold: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Sustained.

Susan Necheles: You worked as a junior bookkeeper, you said?

Rebecca Manochio: Yes.

Susan Necheles: Am I correct that it was the practice for legal expenses to be booked in President Trump's personal account or his personal General Ledger as legal expenses?

Rebecca Manochio: I'm not sure.

Susan Necheles: You weren't in charge, you weren't involved?

Rebecca Manochio: No.

Susan Necheles: So you just don't know anything about that, right?

Rebecca Manochio: No.

Susan Necheles: On your direct examination you were asked about how often Allen Weisselberg spoke with President Trump, do you remember that?

Rebecca Manochio: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And you testified that it was about once a day?

Rebecca Manochio: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And that was for the period that was before President Trump started running for election, right?

Rebecca Manochio: Correct.

Susan Necheles: So, and after President Trump started running for election, he was out of the office a lot?

Rebecca Manochio: Correct.

Susan Necheles: And, to the best of your knowledge, Allen Weisselberg was not speaking to him every day?

Rebecca Manochio: Correct.

Susan Necheles: President Trump was very busy and out of the office, right?

Rebecca Manochio: Correct.

Susan Necheles: And then after President Trump went to the White House, after he was elected and went to the White House, to the best of your knowledge, President Trump and Allen Weisselberg didn't speak at all?

Rebecca Manochio: Correct.

Susan Necheles: I have no further questions.

Juan Merchan: Any redirect?

Rebecca Mangold: Nothing further.

Juan Merchan: Thank you. You can step down. People, your next witness.

Rebecca Mangold: Your Honor, the People call Tracey Menzies.

Juan Merchan: It will just be a minute.

Court Officer: Step this way. Raise your right hand and face the clerk.

Court Clerk: Do you solemnly swear or affirm that the testimony that you are going to give before this Court and jury shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, do you so swear or affirm?

Tracey Menzies: I do.

Note: [T-R-A-C-E-Y M-E-N-Z-I-E-S, called as a witness on behalf of the People, was duly sworn by the Clerk of the Court, upon being examined, testified as follows.]

Court Clerk: Thank you.

Juan Merchan: Good afternoon. You may inquire.

Rebecca Mangold: Thank you.

Note: [Direct examination by Rebecca Mangold.]

Rebecca Mangold: Good afternoon, Ms. Menzies. Can you please tell the jury where you work?

Tracey Menzies: I work at HarperCollins Publishing.

Tracey Menzies: Book publishing. We are the second largest book publisher in the world.

Rebecca Mangold: How long have you worked at HarperCollins?

Tracey Menzies: Twenty-five years.

Rebecca Mangold: What is your current position there?

Tracey Menzies: I am the Senior Vice-President of Production and Creative Operations.

Rebecca Mangold: Have you testified in a legal proceeding before?

Tracey Menzies: No, I have not.

Rebecca Mangold: This is your first time?

Tracey Menzies: Yes, it is.

Rebecca Mangold: Do you understand that you're testifying today as a custodian of records for HarperCollins?

Tracey Menzies: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Is HarperCollins testifying voluntarily, or was the company compelled to testify pursuant to a subpoena?

Tracey Menzies: Compelled to testify, subpoena.

Rebecca Mangold: Does HarperCollins have counsel?

Tracey Menzies: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Is HarperCollins' counsel present in the courtroom today?

Tracey Menzies: Yes, they are.

Rebecca Mangold: As a Senior Vice-President of Production and Creative Operations for HarperCollins, are you familiar with the company's book publishing process?

Tracey Menzies: I am.

Rebecca Mangold: At HarperCollins how involved are authors in the publication of their books?

Tracey Menzies: At HarperCollins, the author has a partner. We work with them to approve files and their cover design, their designs, their content, as we go to print it.

Rebecca Mangold: So you are saying there are multiple points in the publishing process for authors to have input into their books?

Tracey Menzies: Yes, they're fully engaged.

Rebecca Mangold: That includes the cover design for the books?

Tracey Menzies: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: And also the content of the books?

Tracey Menzies: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: And are they required to sign off on that before the book is published?

Tracey Menzies: Yes, they are.

Rebecca Mangold: How about if there is more than one author, are all of the authors required to sign off before the book is published?

Tracey Menzies: I believe so.

Rebecca Mangold: Are you familiar with the book entitled: Think Big: Make it Happen in Business and in Life?

Tracey Menzies: Yes, I am.

Rebecca Mangold: How are you familiar with that book?

Tracey Menzies: It's here. I looked through it.

Rebecca Mangold: It was published by HarperCollins?

Tracey Menzies: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Before testifying today, how did you obtain the copy of the book that you have with you now?

Tracey Menzies: I ordered it from the warehouse using the HarperCollins employee website.

Rebecca Mangold: And is that different from the way a member of the public would buy the book?

Tracey Menzies: Yes, it's direct from the warehouse, so not through a retailer.

Rebecca Mangold: And do you know if there was an audio book associated with the print book?

Tracey Menzies: There is an audio book, yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Do you know who the author of this book is?

Tracey Menzies: I do.

Rebecca Mangold: Who is the author?

Tracey Menzies: There are two authors, Donald Trump and Bill Zanker.

Rebecca Mangold: Do you know who narrated the introduction for the audio book portion of the book?

Tracey Menzies: I believe it is Donald Trump.

Rebecca Mangold: Before testifying today, did you have an opportunity to review files marked for identification as People's Exhibit 415 and 415A through F?

Tracey Menzies: Yes, I did.

Rebecca Mangold: Are those examples a set of excerpts from the book Think Big: Make it happen in Business and in Life?

Tracey Menzies: Yes, they are.

Rebecca Mangold: Do some of the exhibit pages contain redactions?

Tracey Menzies: Yes, they do.

Rebecca Mangold: Before testifying today, did you have an opportunity to compare People's Exhibit 415A for identification with the publisher's version of the book that you obtained?

Tracey Menzies: Yes, I did.

Rebecca Mangold: Other than the redactions, are the exhibits exact copies of portions of the publisher's version of the book?

Tracey Menzies: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: We now offer People's Exhibit 415 and 415A through F into evidence.

Todd Blanche: No objection.

Juan Merchan: People's 415 and 415A through F are accepted into evidence.

Note: [Whereupon, People's Exhibits 415, 415A through F were received into evidence.]

Rebecca Mangold: Can we show the jury what is now in evidence as People's Exhibit 415.

Note: [Displayed]

Rebecca Mangold: Do you recognize this?

Tracey Menzies: I am sorry.

Rebecca Mangold: Can you see the screen?

Tracey Menzies: Yes, I do.

Rebecca Mangold: What is this?

Tracey Menzies: This is the Think Big, the book.

Rebecca Mangold: The book that you purchased?

Tracey Menzies: Yes. Purchased and published, yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Do you see the names of the authors on the cover of the book?

Tracey Menzies: I do.

Rebecca Mangold: And can you read the authors' names from the top of the page?

Tracey Menzies: It says Donald Trump and Bill Zanker.

Rebecca Mangold: And can you talk about, in terms of cover design, the relative font sizes of the two authors' names?

Tracey Menzies: Well, Trump is pictured on the cover and his name is quite large. And Bill Zanker is more of a supporting role with a smaller font.

Rebecca Mangold: Is a picture of Bill Zanker also featured on the cover?

Tracey Menzies: No.

Rebecca Mangold: Can we turn to the next page of the PDF.

Note: [Displayed]

Rebecca Mangold: Do you know what this is?

Tracey Menzies: This is the title page of the book.

Rebecca Mangold: Does this have Mr. Trump's full name?

Tracey Menzies: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Finally, turning to the last page of the PDF. Do you recognize this?

Tracey Menzies: Yes, this is the copyright page.

Rebecca Mangold: And whose names are next to the copyright?

Tracey Menzies: Donald J. Trump and Bill Zanker.

Rebecca Mangold: Can you tell what year this book was first published?

Tracey Menzies: The year it was first published, 2007.

Rebecca Mangold: In what year is this edition of the book?

Tracey Menzies: 21. 2021.

Rebecca Mangold: How can you tell?

Tracey Menzies: On the printer line on the bottom. On the left-hand side it tells you the date.

Rebecca Mangold: Can you tell the publisher information for this book?

Tracey Menzies: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Does it list HarperCollins as the publisher?

Tracey Menzies: Yes, it does.

Rebecca Mangold: Now, are you familiar with the contents of this book?

Tracey Menzies: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Is there a way for the reader to tell which part of the book was written by which author?

Tracey Menzies: Yes, there is. There are different sections. One of the sections are called Zanker's Take. Also, the design of the book. Zanker's Take has like a graph above it, so it separates it out from Donald Trump's words. Donald Trump's words, or at least the writing, is in a sterile front, and Zanker's is a nonsterile front, a thinner font.

Tracey Menzies: So you could tell the difference between the two.

Rebecca Mangold: So, there are multiple ways for readers to tell which author is speaking in a portion of the book?

Tracey Menzies: Indicate which author is speaking.

Rebecca Mangold: Can you please publish for the jury what is now in evidence as People's Exhibit 415A.

Note: [Displayed]

Rebecca Mangold: Can you see that on your screen?

Tracey Menzies: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Is this an excerpt from the same book?

Tracey Menzies: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: What page is this from?

Tracey Menzies: 154

Rebecca Mangold: Based on your review of the book, is this from a section of the Book attributed to Mr. Trump or Mr. Zanker?

Tracey Menzies: Mr. Trump.

Rebecca Mangold: Is that true of the rest of the exhibits that form part of People's Exhibit 415?

Tracey Menzies: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Is there a section heading here at the top of the page?

Tracey Menzies: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: What does that say?

Tracey Menzies: Do Not Trust Anyone

Rebecca Mangold: And what does the unredacted content of the page say?

Tracey Menzies: "I used to say go out and get the best people and trust them. Over the years, I've seen too many shenanigans. Now I say, get the best people and don't trust them. Do not trust them because if you don't know what you're doing, they're going to rob you blind. I know dozens of sophisticated business people who hired accountants and lawyers and others and they trusted them, they got killed.

Tracey Menzies: They lost their business. So I say, get the best people and don't trust them."

Rebecca Mangold: Can you please display for the jury what is in evidence as People's 415B.

Note: [Displayed]

Rebecca Mangold: Ms. Menzies, is this another excerpt from the same book?

Tracey Menzies: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: What page is this?

Tracey Menzies: 160

Rebecca Mangold: Please read the unredacted portion of this page to the jury.

Tracey Menzies: Sure. "As a matter of fact, I value loyalty above everything else. More than brains, more than drive, and more than energy."

Rebecca Mangold: Can we please display for the jury what is in evidence as People's Exhibit 415C.

Note: [Displayed]

Rebecca Mangold: Is this another page from the same book?

Tracey Menzies: Yes. Page 162.

Rebecca Mangold: Please read the unredacted portion of the page.

Tracey Menzies: "I think the reason we have so many loyal people is that we reward loyalty and everybody knows this. It has become part of the corporate culture at The Trump Organization. People like Allen Weisselberg and Matt Calamari are great and have proven themselves over many years."

Rebecca Mangold: So, I think you said "corporate culture at The Trump Organization?"

Tracey Menzies: "Corporate culture of the Trump Organization."

Rebecca Mangold: Now, can we please display 415D to the jury.

Note: [Displayed]

Rebecca Mangold: What page is this?

Tracey Menzies: Page 180.

Rebecca Mangold: Can you plead read the unredacted portion of this.

Tracey Menzies: Sure. "I just can't stomach disloyalty. I put the people who are loyal to me on a high pedestal and take care of them very well. I go out of my way for the people who are loyal to me in bad times. This woman was very disloyal, and now I go out of my way to make her life miserable."

Rebecca Mangold: Can we please display People's 415E.

Note: [Displayed]

Rebecca Mangold: What page number is this?

Tracey Menzies: Page 183.

Rebecca Mangold: Can you read the unredacted portion to the jury?

Rebecca Mangold: Finally, can we pull up People's Exhibit 415F.

Note: [Displayed]

Rebecca Mangold: What page is this?

Tracey Menzies: 192

Rebecca Mangold: Can you read the unredacted portion of this page to the jury?

Tracey Menzies: "When you're wronged, go after those people because it is a good feeling and because other people will see you doing it. Getting even is not always a personal thing. It's just part of doing business."

Rebecca Mangold: No further questions.

Juan Merchan: Mr. Blanche.

Note: [Direct examination by Todd Blanche.]

Todd Blanche: Good afternoon.

Tracey Menzies: Good afternoon.

Todd Blanche: My name is Todd Blanche and I represent President Trump. We've never met before, have we?

Tracey Menzies: No, we have not.

Todd Blanche: Just a couple of questions. Now, this book was published in 2007, is that correct?

Tracey Menzies: Yes.

Todd Blanche: You worked for a long time for HarperCollins. Were you part of the publishing of this particular book?

Tracey Menzies: No, I was not.

Todd Blanche: So you said a little bit about the cover and how HaperCollins will work with the author to come to what the cover should look like and how it should be presented. At the end of the day, is it fair to say that covers of books, at least in part, are designed and developed for sales to help sell the book, is that fair?

Tracey Menzies: They're helped to sell the book, but they're also done very closely with the author.

Todd Blanche: Understood. Understood. And just to spend a few minutes on what you were just asked to read. Every page that you read was partially redacted, correct?

Tracey Menzies: Yes.

Todd Blanche: And you have the book in front of you. Is it fair to say that the book is 380 pages? You can check.

Tracey Menzies: Yes, that's fair to say.

Todd Blanche: Is that right?

Tracey Menzies: Close enough.

Todd Blanche: And you were shown six pages in between Pages 154 and 192, correct?

Tracey Menzies: Yes.

Todd Blanche: A portion of six pages, correct?

Tracey Menzies: Uh-huh.

Todd Blanche: Did you pick those or did the prosecution?

Tracey Menzies: I did not pick them.

Todd Blanche: Now, it's not unusual that this book has acknowledgements and whatnot, with the author thanking, for example, people that helped him along the way?

Tracey Menzies: Yes.

Todd Blanche: That's not unusual?

Tracey Menzies: No.

Todd Blanche: Does every book have that?

Tracey Menzies: I think most books.

Todd Blanche: Are you familiar with the book that you have in front of you, that Donald Trump, President Trump, thanked a number of people, including a staff writer named Meredith Mclver, does that ring bell to you? I can show you, if you don't want to look.

Tracey Menzies: Show me.

Todd Blanche: If we can show for the witness and the Court and the parties M-3.

Note: [Displayed]

Todd Blanche: So look at the top paragraph. There are a number of names. Do you see a staff writer?

Tracey Menzies: I see. Yes.

Todd Blanche: And then --

Todd Blanche: If you can leave that up.

Todd Blanche: -- President Trump also thanks a number of folks from your place?

Tracey Menzies: Yes.

Todd Blanche: From HarperCollins. That is not unusual, is it?

Tracey Menzies: No.

Todd Blanche: And you testified, I believe, that there are two authors, Mr. Zanker and President Trump, and that the book kind of distinguishes between the two, as far as which portions were written from President Trump and which portions were written by Mr. Zanker, correct?

Tracey Menzies: Yes.

Todd Blanche: Is it fair to say Mr. Zanker and President Trump in their respective sections may have had help writing the words that were ultimately published?

Tracey Menzies: I wouldn't know that, but it's possible.

Todd Blanche: Is that something that, for example, the acknowledgements would acknowledge?

Tracey Menzies: They could, sure.

Todd Blanche: No further questions.

Juan Merchan: Any redirect?

Rebecca Mangold: No.

Juan Merchan: Your next witness.

Rebecca Mangold: The People call Madeleine Westerhout.

Court Officer: Raise your right hand and face the clerk.

Madeleine Westerhout: About a year and a half.

Rebecca Mangold: Can you tell the jury a little bit about your educational background.

Madeleine Westerhout: Sure. I went to the College of Charleston. Got my undergraduate degree in political science.

Rebecca Mangold: What did you do after you graduated?

Madeleine Westerhout: I moved to Washington D.C., where I had an internship on Capital Hill for a couple of weeks while I was looking for a job. Then I got a job full-time job at the Republican National Committee.

Rebecca Mangold: For those who may not know, what is the Republican National Committee?

Madeleine Westerhout: The Republican National Committee, otherwise known as the RNC, is the Republican's Party's National Party Committee. So their main role is to elect Republicans up and down the ballot, but really focusing on electing a President.

Rebecca Mangold: Is it fair to say it's the organization that runs the Republican Party?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes, I think that's fair to say.

Rebecca Mangold: And when you joined the RNC, was it your full-time job to work for the RNC's Finance Director?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: And did your role at some point change?

Madeleine Westerhout: It did, yes.

Rebecca Mangold: And can you explain what happened to the jury?

Madeleine Westerhout: Sure. After the 2014 cycle, my boss, who was the Financial Director, was promoted to the Chief of Staff. So I became her assistant as she was the Chief of Staff.

Rebecca Mangold: In that role, was it your full-time job to interact with the RNC's Chief of Staff?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: How long were you in that role?

Madeleine Westerhout: From June 2013 to January 2017.

Rebecca Mangold: And, in total, how long were you part of the RNC?

Madeleine Westerhout: Three and a half years.

Rebecca Mangold: And did you work directly for RNC leadership that entire time?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: At some point in October 2016, did you become aware of what became known as the Access Hollywood tape?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: What was that?

Madeleine Westerhout: It was a tape of Mr. Trump and, I believe it was Billy Bush, having a conversation.

Rebecca Mangold: And what impact did the Access Hollywood tape have on the leadership of the RNC?

Madeleine Westerhout: At the time I recall it rattled the RNC leadership.

Rebecca Mangold: Did the RNC leadership consider replacing Mr. Trump as a candidate?

Madeleine Westerhout: It's my recollection that there were conversations about how to, if it was needed, how it would be possible to replace him as the candidate if it came to that.

Rebecca Mangold: Was Mr. Trump ultimately the Republican candidate in the 2016 election?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes, he was.

Rebecca Mangold: Before the 2016 election, did you ever work for Mr. Trump or his campaign?

Madeleine Westerhout: No, I did not.

Rebecca Mangold: What happened to your role after Mr. Trump was elected?

Madeleine Westerhout: After Mr. Trump was elected, I went and spent some time in New York working out of Trump Tower. Once the party has a nominee, the Republican Party, the RNC, that campaign really combines forces and then works really seamlessly. After the election, I spent time in Trump Tower and helped the President Elect schedule high-level interviews, so people that were interviewed for cabinet positions or high-level senior staff roles.

Rebecca Mangold: How much time did you spend in Trump Tower during that period when Mr. Trump was the President-Elect?

Madeleine Westerhout: I was still living full-time in Washington D.C., but myself and a couple of my colleagues at the RNC would travel to New York and spend most of the working days in New York. So a majority of the working days from November until about January.

Rebecca Mangold: You say that your role there was to schedule high-level meetings for Mr. Trump at that time?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Did you get a nickname in the media due to your role in scheduling high level meetings?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: What was that?

Madeleine Westerhout: "The greeter girl."

Rebecca Mangold: Did you work with or do you know somebody named Rhona Graff?

Madeleine Westerhout: I do.

Rebecca Mangold: Who is Rhona Graff?

Madeleine Westerhout: She was President Trump's -- Mr. Trump's long-term Executive Assistant at The Trump Organization. I don't recall her exact title, but she had been with him for a very long time.

Rebecca Mangold: Do you know how long she had worked for Mr. Trump before he was elected President?

Madeleine Westerhout: I think over 10 years. I'm not 100 percent sure.

Rebecca Mangold: Based on your experience -- withdrawn. Did you work with Ms. Graff during this transition period when Mr. Trump was the President-Elect?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes. She had a role in helping the RNC schedule his interviews. She was still really taking over, really had a handle on his schedule as he wasn't yet the President. He was still working out of Trump Tower. So we worked seamlessly together.

Rebecca Mangold: Based on your experience working with Ms. Graff, was Mr. Graff familiar with Mr. Trump's preference and work habits?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: And also Mr. Trump's contacts?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Do you know someone by the name of Michael Cohen?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Who is Michael Cohen?

Madeleine Westerhout: He was the President's former lawyer.

Rebecca Mangold: And how do you know him?

Madeleine Westerhout: He was around in Trump Tower.

Rebecca Mangold: And when you say "he was around in Trump Tower," that's at this time, between the election and inauguration?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: The end of 2016 and early 2017?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: At some point during this period, were you offered a job at the White House?

Madeleine Westerhout: I was, yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Can you tell the jury about that?

Madeleine Westerhout: Sure. My boss at the time came to me and said: "Do you have any interest in sitting outside the Oval Office?" I said: "Yes, I do. That sounds like it would be a very cool job."

Rebecca Mangold: Were you offered a particular job title at that time?

Madeleine Westerhout: I honestly don't remember at this time if titles were discussed, but I knew I was going to sit outside the Oval Office. I didn't care what my title was.

Rebecca Mangold: Do you remember around when that conversation took place?

Madeleine Westerhout: I believe December of 2016.

Rebecca Mangold: And had you spent any time working directly with Mr. Trump when you were offered that position?

Madeleine Westerhout: No.

Rebecca Mangold: Do you know when Mr. Trump moved from Trump Tower to the White House?

Madeleine Westerhout: January 20, 2017.

Rebecca Mangold: And how do you know it was that date?

Madeleine Westerhout: That was the inauguration date.

Rebecca Mangold: Did you also move to D.C. full-time on that date?

Madeleine Westerhout: I had never technically moved to New York, so I just never -- I just stopped going to New York.

Rebecca Mangold: Did you attend the inauguration?

Madeleine Westerhout: I did, yes.

Rebecca Mangold: And what happened after the inauguration?

Madeleine Westerhout: After the inauguration, I went to a Government building across the street from the White House and, you know, went through security, and then, with a couple of my new colleagues, were put in a van to drive across the street. And then we were taken into the West Wing. Kind of shown around a little bit. Taken into the Roosevelt room, where we were given laptops and cell phones.

Madeleine Westerhout: And then I was taken to my desk, which was, as I had been told, right outside of the Oval Office.

Rebecca Mangold: Did you start work that day?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes, technically.

Rebecca Mangold: Had you been to the West Wing before then?

Madeleine Westerhout: No.

Rebecca Mangold: Can we put up just for the witness, the parties, and the Court, People's Exhibit 390 for identification.

Rebecca Mangold: Ms. Westerhout, do you recognize this?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: What is this?

Madeleine Westerhout: This is a map of the first floor of the West Wing.

Rebecca Mangold: Did you create this map?

Madeleine Westerhout: No, I did not.

Rebecca Mangold: Do you find the map to be a fair and accurate depiction of the first floor of the West Wing?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: I now offer People's Exhibit 390 into evidence.

Susan Necheles: No objection.

Juan Merchan: Accepted into evidence.

Note: [Whereupon, People's Exhibit 390 was received into evidence.]

Rebecca Mangold: Pull up 390 for the jury.

Note: [Displayed]

Rebecca Mangold: Is this the floor plan you were talking about?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Where is the Oval Office on the floor plan?

Madeleine Westerhout: It's the Oval Office labeled "Oval Office" on the bottom, in the middle.

Rebecca Mangold: Can we pull up just the section "Floor Plan" around the Oval Office, please. Can we make it a little bit wider.

Note: [Displayed]

Rebecca Mangold: And can you see that in front of you, Ms. Westerhout?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Do you see the Number 7 on the floor plan?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Can you describe, I believe it's a little bit above and to the right of the Office Office, is that correct?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Can you describe what that area is to the jury?

Madeleine Westerhout: That is the area known as the Outer Oval Office.

Rebecca Mangold: What is the Outer Oval Office?

Madeleine Westerhout: It's where the President's secretaries or assistants sat.

Rebecca Mangold: And can you describe for the jury where your desk was relative to the Oval Office?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes. If you look at Number 7 as like a square, my desk was the bottom right.

Rebecca Mangold: So your desk was up against the wall of the Oval Office, is that right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Up against the horizontal line, kind of coming out of the Oval Office.

Rebecca Mangold: Did anybody in White House sit closer to Mr. Trump than you did?

Madeleine Westerhout: Not in the first few months, no.

Rebecca Mangold: Did anybody else sit in the Outer Oval with you?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Who else sat in the Outer Oval?

Madeleine Westerhout: Hope Hicks.

Rebecca Mangold: Who is Hope Hicks?

Madeleine Westerhout: She was the President's Communications Director.

Rebecca Mangold: And was there anybody else that sat in that area?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes. In the Outer Oval Office there was a little -- another little room and two of his aides sat there.

Rebecca Mangold: Who were those two aides in 2017?

Madeleine Westerhout: John McEntee and Keith Schiller.

Rebecca Mangold: Do you know what their titles were?

Madeleine Westerhout: I believe Keith was the Director of Oval Office Operations. I believe John was Personal Aide to the President.

Rebecca Mangold: Do you know someone by the name of Dan Scavino?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Who is Dan Scavino?

Madeleine Westerhout: Dan Scavino was one of the President's very trusted advisors.

Rebecca Mangold: Did he have a particular role in the White House?

Madeleine Westerhout: He did a lot of the President's communications, and especially helped the President get tweets out and other statements.

Rebecca Mangold: So he worked with Mr. Trump on social media?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: As the Executive Assistant -- withdrawn. Did you later find out what your formal title would be in the White House?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes. Special Assistant to the President and Executive Assistant to the President.

Rebecca Mangold: And in those roles, who was the focus of your attention?

Madeleine Westerhout: The President.

Rebecca Mangold: Is that your only focus?

Madeleine Westerhout: I tried to have it be my only focus.

Rebecca Mangold: When you started the job in January 2017, did you have job training or orientation?

Madeleine Westerhout: Not formally, no.

Rebecca Mangold: How did you learn how to do your job?

Madeleine Westerhout: The first few months I tried to really observe people that had been close to him, so people like Hope and John and Keith and Dan, and learn his preferences. Then, it was just a lot of on-the-job training. You know, we really started full force day one. So just trying to do my best to keep up.

Rebecca Mangold: When you say Hope and John and Keith and Dan, are you referring to Hope Hicks, John McEntee, Dan Scavino and Keith Schiller?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Was it your understanding those four individuals had previously worked with Mr. Trump?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Did you also make an effort to learn Mr. Trump's preferences by observing him while you were sitting in the Outer Oval?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: How long did you end up working in the White House?

Madeleine Westerhout: Until August 2019.

Rebecca Mangold: Is that a total of two and a half years?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Did you have the same job in the White House the whole time?

Madeleine Westerhout: The same job, yes. But at some point my title changed to Special Assistant to the President and Director of Oval Office Operations.

Rebecca Mangold: Did you sit at the same desk in the Outer Oval the entire two and a half years you were in the White House?

Madeleine Westerhout: I switched desks at some point. Like I said, there were two desks there. At some point, I switched to the desk that was further away, but it had a line of sight to the Resolute Desk. That was more helpful to kind -- for the President and I to communicate.

Rebecca Mangold: And for those who may not know, what is the Resolute Desk?

Madeleine Westerhout: That is the desk where the President sits in the Oval Office.

Rebecca Mangold: After working closely with Mr. Trump for two and a half years, did you develop an understanding of his work habits?

Madeleine Westerhout: I did, yes.

Rebecca Mangold: How about list preferences?

Madeleine Westerhout: I hope so.

Rebecca Mangold: How about Mr. Trump's relationships and contacts?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Are you familiar with the way that he used social media?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Are you familiar with the way that he interacted with others at the White House?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: And are you familiar with the way that he interacted with his family?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: So, turning now to his work habits, what was Mr. Trump's preferred method of communication?

Madeleine Westerhout: He liked speaking with people in person or on the phone.

Rebecca Mangold: And about how many calls did Mr. Trump typically take in a day?

Madeleine Westerhout: A lot.

Rebecca Mangold: Do you know, approximately, when he started taking calls in the day?

Madeleine Westerhout: I remember times where, you know, I knew he was taking calls as early as 6 in the morning.

Rebecca Mangold: And when would he stop taking calls at the end of the day?

Madeleine Westerhout: Again, it depended. I recall times he would be on the phone late into the night after I went to bed, so I always felt guilty about that.

Rebecca Mangold: How did you call the President at work? Can anybody call the President of the United States. Is this a more complicated process?

Madeleine Westerhout: There is a rather complicated process. If the President is in the Oval Office and someone calls in and they had my desk phone number, they could just call that number. If the President was available, I would patch them through. If someone was calling in, John Smith, you know, off the street and just calling 1-800 White House, obviously, they wouldn't be patched through to the Oval Office.

Madeleine Westerhout: But there were operators that took calls and then kind of determined if that person was someone that needed to get patched through either to myself or other members of the President's staff. There were also calls made by the situation room. Calls that were more secure that might need to be on a secure line.

Madeleine Westerhout: People might call through the situation room.

Rebecca Mangold: Once the White House operators had screened calls, did you see the calls that came to you after that?

Madeleine Westerhout: I am sorry.

Rebecca Mangold: Let me say that again. After the calls were screened, did they typically come to you before going to Mr. Trump?

Madeleine Westerhout: If he was in the Oval Office, yes.

Rebecca Mangold: So you were able to see much of the many people that he spoke to while he was there in 2017?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Did Mr. Trump use a computer?

Madeleine Westerhout: Not to my knowledge.

Rebecca Mangold: Did Mr. Trump have an email account?

Madeleine Westerhout: Not to my knowledge.

Rebecca Mangold: Did Mr. Trump prefer electronic documents or hard copy documents?

Madeleine Westerhout: He liked hard copy documents.

Rebecca Mangold: And did Mr. Trump like to read?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Did his role in 2017 require a lot of reading?

Madeleine Westerhout: It did, yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Where did he actually do his work?

Madeleine Westerhout: After a few weeks, he kind of moved his working space into a room off of the side of the Oval Office, known as the dining room. He really just, I remember, wanted to keep the Resolute Desk very pristine and kind of keep that more for meetings. Then he spent most of the time when he was working, reading, going over documents in the dining room.

Madeleine Westerhout: And that was really his working office.

Rebecca Mangold: Were the hard copy documents that he liked to review kept in the dining room?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Was there an organization system there?

Madeleine Westerhout: To my understanding, the President knew where things were and he kept it organized. But he did have a lot of papers and often brought things back and forth to his residence or Air Force One or Marine One. I thought he always knew where things were.

Rebecca Mangold: In general, is he the type of person who would pay attention to details?

Madeleine Westerhout: In my experience, yes.

Rebecca Mangold: How about his signature practices? Did he have to sign things that you saw in that first year in 2017?

Madeleine Westerhout: He did.

Rebecca Mangold: Did he use an automated signature or prefer to sign himself?

Madeleine Westerhout: He preferred to sign things himself.

Rebecca Mangold: That was signing by hand?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Was there a particular style of pen he liked to use?

Madeleine Westerhout: My recollection is he liked to use a Sharpie or a felt-tip pen.

Rebecca Mangold: Based on working with him for two and a half years, can you recognize Mr. Trump's signature?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Did Mr. Trump have to review and sign a lot of documents that year in 2017?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: In your experience, did he typically read things before signing them?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Do you know if Mr. Trump used social media while he was in the White House?

Madeleine Westerhout: He did, yes.

Rebecca Mangold: What was the primary social media platform that he used?

Madeleine Westerhout: Twitter.

Rebecca Mangold: Is that now called something else?

Madeleine Westerhout: X.

Rebecca Mangold: Do you know what Mr. Trump's Twitter handle was in 2017?

Madeleine Westerhout: @realdonaldtrump.

Rebecca Mangold: Did Mr. Trump post tweets himself using that Twitter handle?

Madeleine Westerhout: He did, yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Did anyone else have access to the @realdonaldtrump Twitter account in 2017?

Madeleine Westerhout: It's my understanding that Dan Scavino had access to it.

Rebecca Mangold: Was there anybody other than Mr. Trump and Mr. Scavino?

Madeleine Westerhout: Not to my knowledge.

Rebecca Mangold: In the two and a half years when you worked with Mr. Trump, did you ever see Mr. Scavino post a tweet without Mr. Trump's approval?

Madeleine Westerhout: I did not see Dan post, I didn't see the President or Dan ever post a single tweet. Not to my knowledge. If there was a video recap of an event or something that might have gone out without the President's approval, it's my understanding and recollection that the President did like to see the tweets that went out.

Rebecca Mangold: Do you know if that account was password protected?

Madeleine Westerhout: I believe so, yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Did you ever work directly with Mr. Trump on his Twitter posts?

Madeleine Westerhout: Once in a while, if Dan wasn't available, the President would call me and dictate a tweet to me. I would quickly scribble it down and then go back to my computer and type it up so that the President could actually read it because he wasn't able to read my handwriting. Sometimes print it back out, give it to him so he could look over it. It just depended if he put it out or held onto it or made edits to. That was the extent of it.

Rebecca Mangold: He would dictate a tweet to you, then you would go type it up on your computer?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Then you would print a hard copy document?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: And take that in for him to review?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Would he then edit sometimes the hard copy printout?

Madeleine Westerhout: Sometimes, yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Would he ask you to make additional changes and then show it to him?

Madeleine Westerhout: Sometimes.

Rebecca Mangold: Did he have any particular preferences when it came to the way that he wrote social media posts?

Madeleine Westerhout: My recollection is that there were certain words that he liked to capitalize. Words like "country." And he liked to use exclamation points.

Rebecca Mangold: Did he also periodically correct other punctuation, like commas or comma locations?

Madeleine Westerhout: It's my understanding that he liked to use the Oxford comma.

Rebecca Mangold: Now, during that first year in the White House in 2017, would you describe that as a transition period, that first year that Mr. Trump was in the White House?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes. I think, you know, the first year of any administration is a transition year. We were all trying to learn our way around and, you know, do the best work we could for the American people.

Rebecca Mangold: And you and others were doing things for the first time that year?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: And was Mr. Trump busy that year?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Was he constantly being pulled in a lot of different directions?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Based on your experience, were there things he overlooked or forgot during that period? Was he still attentive to the things that were brought to his attention?

Madeleine Westerhout: My understanding is he was attentive to things that were brought to his attention.

Rebecca Mangold: During that first year in the White House, in 2017, when things were in transition, did you coordinate with The Trump Organization?

Madeleine Westerhout: On some things, yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Did you ever have questions for employees at The Trump Organization?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: And did Trump Organization employees ever have questions for you?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Who was your main point of contact at The Trump Organization in 2017?

Madeleine Westerhout: Rhona Graff.

Rebecca Mangold: And, again, that was Mr. Trump's Trump Organization's Executive Assistant?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: And she remained at The Trump Organization after Mr. Trump moved to Washington D.C.?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: When Trump Organization employees had questions for Mr. Trump, did you pass those along?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes, sometimes.

Rebecca Mangold: Were there ever times that you didn't pass along something you were asked to?

Madeleine Westerhout: No, but it could have been they asked somebody else.

Rebecca Mangold: When Mr. Trump had questions for Trump Organization employees, did you pass those along?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: What types of things did you coordinate with Ms. Graff on during that year in 2017. Did you coordinate on Mr. Trump's contacts?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes, we did.

Rebecca Mangold: How about calls to and from Mr. Trump?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: How about Mr. Trump's calendar?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Mr. Trump's travel schedule?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Mr. Trump's golf schedule?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: How about the First Family's travel?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Personal mail for Mr. Trump?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: What other logistical issues?

Madeleine Westerhout: Such as?

Rebecca Mangold: For example, if there was an issue getting through on a particular number or other things that were lost in translation, anything like that?

Madeleine Westerhout: Sure. Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Overall, how frequently were you in touch with The Trump Organization in 20127?

Madeleine Westerhout: Especially the first few months, I think Rhona and I spoke at least weekly. Sometimes daily. But that trickled off as I kind of grew in the role and the contacts kind of shifted over to more of the White House side.

Rebecca Mangold: And, in total, how many communications would you say you had with The Trump Organization in 2017, a rough estimate? Is it fair to say it was dozens of communications?

Madeleine Westerhout: Dozens.

Rebecca Mangold: Now, one of the things you just mentioned was Mr. Trump's contacts, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: And did you get guidance from Ms. Graff on contacts that were important to Mr. Trump?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Can we show the jury what is in evidence as People's Exhibit 68. And can we blow up the top portion of the page. All of the portions.

Note: [Displayed]

Rebecca Mangold: Ms. Westerhout, do you recognize this?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: What is this?

Madeleine Westerhout: It's an email exchange between Rhona and myself.

Rebecca Mangold: And looking at the bottom-most email on the chain, who is that from?

Madeleine Westerhout: From me to Rhona.

Rebecca Mangold: What is date of that email?

Madeleine Westerhout: Tuesday, January 20, 2017.

Rebecca Mangold: And are there certain redactions in this email?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Have you reviewed the unredacted version of this email?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: And is that an email sent from your White House email address?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Note: [Whereupon, Theresa Magniccari, Senior Court Reporter was relieved by Laurie Eisenberg as Senior Court Reporter.]

Rebecca Mangold: And is that sent to Rhona Graff's Trump Organization address?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: And what's the subject of this email?

Madeleine Westerhout: "Contacts."

Rebecca Mangold: Can you please read the content of that email to the jury?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes. "Could you have the girls put together a list for me of people that he frequently spoke to? I don't want to have to bug you all the time, even though I will still call often." Smiley face.

Rebecca Mangold: When you said, "Could you have the girls put together a list for me," who were "the girls"?

Madeleine Westerhout: There were a couple of other assistants that worked under -- in The Trump Organization.

Rebecca Mangold: When you said "a list of people that he frequently spoke to", who does he refer to there?

Madeleine Westerhout: President Trump.

Rebecca Mangold: And why did you -- can you explain to the jury, kind of, why you sent this email?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yeah. So, when I got to the White House, I, naively, assumed that the operators kind of had everybody's phone number, and that is not the case. They didn't have, really, any phone numbers. And so, the President would often ask, you know, call John Smith, call so and so, and I didn't have their phone numbers.

Madeleine Westerhout: So, I would call Rhona all the time, asking for phone numbers for people, and that's something -- I guess, four days in, I just asked her to put together a list for me that she thought would be helpful of people that he either spoke to often or might want to speak to.

Rebecca Mangold: If you look at the top email on the chain, how did Ms. Graff respond?

Madeleine Westerhout: She said: "I'm working on it. Hope to have it to you in a little while."

Rebecca Mangold: Can you now pull up what's in evidence as People's 69?

Rebecca Mangold: Focus on the top portion of the page.

Rebecca Mangold: Do you recognize this?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: What is this?

Madeleine Westerhout: An email exchange between myself and Rhona.

Rebecca Mangold: Who is it from?

Madeleine Westerhout: Rhona.

Rebecca Mangold: Who is it to?

Madeleine Westerhout: Me.

Rebecca Mangold: What is the subject?

Madeleine Westerhout: "Contacts."

Rebecca Mangold: What is the body of the email?

Madeleine Westerhout: "How is this for a start? R."

Rebecca Mangold: Is this a copy of the email we just looked at?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Can you explain that to the jury?

Madeleine Westerhout: Sorry?

Rebecca Mangold: Withdrawn. Is Ms. Graff sending you the contacts that you had previously requested in the email we just looked at?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Is there an attachment to this email?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes. It says, "DJT limited contacts WH."

Rebecca Mangold: What does "WH" stand for there?

Madeleine Westerhout: White House.

Rebecca Mangold: Do you know what file type that attachment is, based on what's listed there?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes. That's an Excel document.

Rebecca Mangold: Before testifying today, did you have an opportunity to review the Excel file that was attached to the email?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Did you also take a look at a file that's been marked for identification as People's Exhibit 69-B?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Can you pull up People's Exhibit 69-B for just the witness, the parties and the Court?

Note: [Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the witness' and the parties' screens.]

Rebecca Mangold: Do you recognize People's Exhibit 69-B?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: The People offer Exhibit 69-B into evidence.

Susan Necheles: No objection.

Juan Merchan: Accepted into evidence.

Note: [Whereupon, People's Exhibit 69-B is received in evidence and is shown on the screens.]

Rebecca Mangold: Can you describe this, kind of at a high level, for the jury?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes. This is a contact list of the President's friends, family, and people that he might want to speak to.

Rebecca Mangold: How did Ms. Graff determine who to put on this list? What types of contacts were put in?

Madeleine Westerhout: It's my understanding that she put together a list of people that he either spoke to often or might want to speak to.

Rebecca Mangold: Can we look at Page 2 of the PDF, please?

Rebecca Mangold: Focusing in on the top portion of the page.

Rebecca Mangold: Sorry. Pull up the entire portion of the page with words.

Rebecca Mangold: Do you see who's listed in rows 49, 50 and 51?

Rebecca Mangold: Who is David Pecker, if you remember?

Madeleine Westerhout: He's -- at the time, I knew him to just be a tabloid person.

Rebecca Mangold: Can we turn to the first page of the PDF and pull up the top half of the page?

Rebecca Mangold: Who is listed in row 13?

Madeleine Westerhout: Michael Cohen.

Rebecca Mangold: And is that the same Michael Cohen you saw in Trump Tower during the presidential transition period?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Once you received this list, do you recall what you did with it?

Madeleine Westerhout: I believe I entered all of these contacts into my contacts.

Rebecca Mangold: And if a name appeared on this list, were you more likely to patch that call through to Mr. Trump?

Madeleine Westerhout: Um, yes. But I tried to -- yes.

Rebecca Mangold: All right. We can take that down.

Rebecca Mangold: Now, I know we just saw the contact information for Mr. Cohen. Was it your understanding that Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen had a close relationship in 2017?

Madeleine Westerhout: At that time, yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Did Mr. Cohen ever visit the White House in 2017?

Madeleine Westerhout: I believe he did, yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Can we show the witness, the parties, and the Court what's been marked for identification as People's Exhibit 391?

Note: [Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the witness' and the parties' screens.]

Rebecca Mangold: Ms. Westerhout, do you see that on your screen?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Do you recognize it?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: What is that?

Madeleine Westerhout: It's an email from me to Michael Cohen.

Rebecca Mangold: Is it a true and correct copy of the email that you sent to Michael Cohen?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: People now offer People's Exhibit 391 into evidence.

Susan Necheles: No objection.

Juan Merchan: Accepted into evidence.

Note: [Whereupon, People's Exhibit 391 is received in evidence.]

Rebecca Mangold: Can we publish that for the jury?

Rebecca Mangold: What date was this email sent?

Madeleine Westerhout: February 5, 2017.

Rebecca Mangold: And this email is from you?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Is it sent to Michael Cohen at a trumporg email address?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Are there redactions on this page?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Did you have an opportunity to review the unredacted portion?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: What is the subject line of this email?

Madeleine Westerhout: "Wednesday meeting."

Rebecca Mangold: Can you please read the content of the email to the jury?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes. "Michael. We're confirmed for 4:30 on Wednesday. What I need from you is the following: Full name as it appears on your ID. Date of birth. Social Security number. U.S. citizen, yes or no. Born in U.S., yes or no. Current city and state of residence. Thanks, Madeleine."

Rebecca Mangold: Do you recall why you were sending this email?

Madeleine Westerhout: Mr. Cohen was coming in to meet with the President.

Rebecca Mangold: Do you recall seeing him when he came to visit?

Madeleine Westerhout: Not specifically.

Rebecca Mangold: Did this visit, ultimately, occur?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: We can take that down.

Rebecca Mangold: Do you remember David Pecker's name coming up in 2017?

Madeleine Westerhout: I have recently been refreshed. My memory has been refreshed, yes.

Rebecca Mangold: What do you -- after refreshing your recollection, what do you recall?

Madeleine Westerhout: I recall an exchange between myself and Hope, a text that I sent her, asking if she had called David.

Rebecca Mangold: By "Hope", you mean Hope Hicks?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: And "David" is David Pecker?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Do you recall if you ever spoke to Mr. Pecker on the phone in 2017?

Madeleine Westerhout: I don't remember.

Rebecca Mangold: And do you remember if you saw him at the White House?

Madeleine Westerhout: I don't remember. The President met with a lot of people.

Rebecca Mangold: Can we please pull up what's in evidence as People's Exhibit 319?

Rebecca Mangold: Do you recognize this?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: What is this?

Madeleine Westerhout: This is a text exchange between myself and Hope Hicks.

Rebecca Mangold: And whose texts are white?

Madeleine Westerhout: Mine.

Rebecca Mangold: And whose texts are in blue?

Madeleine Westerhout: Hope's.

Rebecca Mangold: Do you remember -- well, directing you now to the bottom text, does it say it was sent on March 20th?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Does it say what year it was sent?

Madeleine Westerhout: No.

Rebecca Mangold: Do you recall what year this was sent?

Madeleine Westerhout: No.

Rebecca Mangold: Can you read that text to the jury?

Madeleine Westerhout: "Hey -- the President wants to know if you called David Pecker again?"

Rebecca Mangold: Do you remember the events surrounding this text?

Madeleine Westerhout: No.

Rebecca Mangold: Was this unusual, for you to send something like this to Ms. Hicks?

Madeleine Westerhout: No.

Rebecca Mangold: And is this the document you were just speaking about that refreshed your recollection that there was -- that you remembered Mr. Pecker's name coming up while you worked at the White House?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Can we show the jury what's in evidence as People's Exhibit 70?

Rebecca Mangold: Now, you said that Mr. Weisselberg was the CFO of The Trump Organization, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Do you remember his name coming up in 2017?

Madeleine Westerhout: Um, not -- well, yes. I mean, he had worked for the President for a very long time. Um. So, yes.

Rebecca Mangold: And looking at the document on the screen in front of you, do you recognize this?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: What is this?

Madeleine Westerhout: An email from me to Rhona Graff.

Rebecca Mangold: And when was it sent?

Madeleine Westerhout: January 27, 2017.

Rebecca Mangold: What's the subject?

Madeleine Westerhout: "NYT" -- I'm sorry. "Photo."

Rebecca Mangold: Can you read the content of the email to the jury?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes. "Can you please send this to Allen Weisselberg from the President? He sent to his family and wanted to" -- sorry. "He sent to his family and wanted Allen to see it as well. First time boarding Air Force One."

Rebecca Mangold: Is it common for Mr. Trump to send newspaper clips to his family and Mr. Weisselberg?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Was it your understanding Mr. Trump and Mr. Weisselberg had a close relationship in 2017?

Madeleine Westerhout: I'm not sure I can speak to the specifics of their relationship, but I believe Allen had worked for him for a long time, so I understood them to be close.

Rebecca Mangold: Did you pass messages back and forth between Mr. Weisselberg and Mr. Trump during 2017?

Madeleine Westerhout: I don't recall specific messages other than this one, but it wouldn't surprise me.

Rebecca Mangold: This doesn't strike you as unusual?

Susan Necheles: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Overruled.

Madeleine Westerhout: I'm sorry. Say that again.

Rebecca Mangold: This doesn't strike you as unusual?

Madeleine Westerhout: No.

Rebecca Mangold: Can we turn now to the attachment to the second page of the PDF?

Rebecca Mangold: What is this?

Madeleine Westerhout: This is the cover of The New York Times, and it's the President boarding Air Force One for the first time.

Rebecca Mangold: This is the newspaper clip that Mr. Trump asked you to send to both his family and Mr. Weisselberg?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: You can take that down.

Rebecca Mangold: Now, what, if anything, is your understanding of how Mr. Trump's personal expenses were handled in 2017?

Madeleine Westerhout: It's my understanding they were handled by checks.

Rebecca Mangold: And how did you learn that they were handled by checks?

Madeleine Westerhout: Checks came to the White House -- I'm sorry. Checks were sent from The Trump Organization to an employee at the White House, and I brought them in for the President to sign.

Rebecca Mangold: Do you know what employee the checks were sent to?

Madeleine Westerhout: They were originally sent to Keith Schiller, and then, later, they were sent to me.

Rebecca Mangold: And what did you do when you received the checks?

Madeleine Westerhout: The checks came in a FedEx envelope. Um, so I opened the envelope. And inside was a manila folder with a stack of checks. And I brought the manila folder in to the President for him to sign.

Rebecca Mangold: And was there anything else besides checks that were contained in the manila folder?

Madeleine Westerhout: Um, I didn't really dig around in the folder, but, um, I believe there were invoices attached to some of the checks sometimes.

Rebecca Mangold: And the checks that you received from Mr. Schiller, you received unsigned checks, is that right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: You said you brought the checks in to Mr. Trump for his signature?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: How frequently did you receive a package of checks for Mr. Trump to sign?

Madeleine Westerhout: I don't recall how frequently, but it was, um, consistent. Maybe twice a month?

Rebecca Mangold: And how many checks, approximately, came in a packet?

Madeleine Westerhout: It depended. Sometimes there was -- sometimes there was one. Sometimes there was a stack, maybe half-an-inch thick. I never counted them.

Rebecca Mangold: Was it ever more than half-an-inch thick or was it typically smaller?

Madeleine Westerhout: I don't remember.

Rebecca Mangold: Now, did you ever see Mr. Trump sign checks in his office?

Madeleine Westerhout: Sometimes, yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Did Mr. Trump individually sign each check by hand?

Madeleine Westerhout: To my knowledge, the ones that I saw him sign. I can't speak to the ones that I didn't see him sign.

Rebecca Mangold: And what happened after Mr. Trump signed the checks?

Madeleine Westerhout: He would give the folder back to me, and I would put it in a pre-labeled FedEx envelope and send it back to The Trump Organization.

Rebecca Mangold: Did the pre-labeled return envelope come with the original FedEx with the checks?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: And you were the one that sent that back to The Trump Organization?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Do you recall if there was ever a time where Mr. Trump didn't send back every single check in a packet?

Madeleine Westerhout: Um, no, I don't recall a specific time.

Rebecca Mangold: Do you remember if Mr. Trump ever had questions on -- about the checks?

Madeleine Westerhout: Um, I think I remember, maybe, a couple times him having a question about a check and then calling Allen -- Allen Weisselberg or somebody else in the Trump Organization to ask for clarification.

Rebecca Mangold: All right.

Rebecca Mangold: Can you please show the jury what is in evidence as People's Exhibit 73?

Rebecca Mangold: Could you blow up the top portion of that document?

Rebecca Mangold: Do you recognize this, Ms. Westerhout?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: What is this?

Madeleine Westerhout: An email from Rhona to me.

Rebecca Mangold: What's the date?

Madeleine Westerhout: April 6, 2017.

Rebecca Mangold: Can you read the content of the email to the jury?

Madeleine Westerhout: "M: Here is the FedEx label you requested. Hope it works." Winking face.

Rebecca Mangold: Can we turn -- is there an attachment to this email?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Can you please flip to Page 2 of the PDF?

Rebecca Mangold: Focus on -- yep, that portion of the page. Do you recognize this?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes. It's a FedEx label.

Rebecca Mangold: Who is the FedEx label to?

Madeleine Westerhout: Rebecca Manochio

Rebecca Mangold: What is the address --

Madeleine Westerhout: The Trump --

Rebecca Mangold: Sorry. -- provided for Ms. Manochio?

Madeleine Westerhout: I'm sorry?

Rebecca Mangold: What is the address provided for Ms. Manochio?

Madeleine Westerhout: The Trump Organization, 725 Fifth Avenue, 26th floor, New York, New York.

Rebecca Mangold: Do you see who the -- I don't know how to describe this. The return recipient is in the top-left corner.

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes. Keith Schiller.

Rebecca Mangold: Mr. Schiller was the one who received the checks that you, ultimately, brought in to Mr. Trump to sign?

Madeleine Westerhout: At this time, yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Can you describe for the jury the contexts around this email?

Madeleine Westerhout: Um, I probably had misplaced the return package with the pre-paid label, and so I was just requesting a new one.

Rebecca Mangold: And this is in connection with checks for Mr. Trump to sign or checks that he had signed?

Madeleine Westerhout: Probably.

Rebecca Mangold: Did you ever request FedEx labels from The Trump Organization for any other reason?

Madeleine Westerhout: Not to my recollection.

Rebecca Mangold: All right. Can we please show Ms. Westerhout and the jury what is in evidence as People's Exhibit 76?

Rebecca Mangold: Do you recognize this?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes. It's an email from me to Rhona Graff.

Rebecca Mangold: What's the date?

Madeleine Westerhout: July 18, 2017.

Rebecca Mangold: What's the subject?

Madeleine Westerhout: "Checks."

Rebecca Mangold: And can you read the content to the jury?

Madeleine Westerhout: "R. Can you have someone send me a FedEx label to send back the checks the President just signed?"

Rebecca Mangold: Is this a reference to the personal checks that we were just talking about?

Madeleine Westerhout: Probably.

Rebecca Mangold: And can we take that down?

Rebecca Mangold: Did Trump Organization employees ever have other questions for Mr. Trump about his personal expenses, unrelated to the checks?

Madeleine Westerhout: I -- I don't know the answer to that.

Rebecca Mangold: There were no one-off questions about Mr. Trump's personal expenses that came through you?

Madeleine Westerhout: Oh. Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Can we show the jury what's in evidence as People's 71, please?

Rebecca Mangold: Can we blow up the top of the email?

Rebecca Mangold: Do you recognize this?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes. It's an email from me to Rhona Graff.

Rebecca Mangold: What's the date?

Madeleine Westerhout: February 21, 2017.

Rebecca Mangold: What's the subject?

Madeleine Westerhout: "Winged Foot Golf Club."

Rebecca Mangold: Do you know what the Winged Foot Golf Club is?

Madeleine Westerhout: I believe it's a golf club.

Rebecca Mangold: Can you read the content of the email to the jury?

Madeleine Westerhout: "Rhona. Can you help me with this? See attached. Thanks. Let me know if I should call them directly."

Rebecca Mangold: Can you flip to the second page of the PDF?

Rebecca Mangold: Do you recognize this?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: What is this?

Madeleine Westerhout: This is an invoice.

Rebecca Mangold: What is it an invoice for?

Madeleine Westerhout: For the President's annual dues to the Winged Foot Golf Club.

Rebecca Mangold: Do you see handwriting on the document?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Is there two sets of handwriting?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Can we please blow up the bottom half of the page?

Rebecca Mangold: Do you recognize both sets of handwriting on the page?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: And is the amount of the invoice also shown here?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: What is the total amount of the invoice?

Madeleine Westerhout: $6,974.01.

Rebecca Mangold: Looking now at the handwriting towards the top, do you know whose handwriting that is?

Madeleine Westerhout: I believe that's Rhona Graff's.

Rebecca Mangold: Can you read what's written in Ms. Graff's writing?

Madeleine Westerhout: "Dear President, If Winged Foot will allow me to suspend your membership for four or eight years, do you want me to look into it, or do you want to continue paying annual dues and the food minimum?" I believe that's just "RG".

Rebecca Mangold: Do you see handwriting below that?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Whose is that?

Madeleine Westerhout: That's the President.

Rebecca Mangold: Do you know what type of pen was used for the President's handwriting?

Madeleine Westerhout: It looks to be a Sharpie.

Rebecca Mangold: What's written below the note in Mr. Trump's handwriting?

Madeleine Westerhout: "Hey."

Rebecca Mangold: Is there something else written in the President's handwriting?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes. "ASAP. Okay."

Rebecca Mangold: Is there another marking next to "Okay"?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes. The shortened signature.

Rebecca Mangold: What is your recollection or understanding of what was happening in this email exchange?

Madeleine Westerhout: Um, this one -- obviously, he wouldn't really be able to use a membership of this golf club while he was in office, so I believe Rhona was asking if she wanted him to suspend his membership or pay the annual dues.

Rebecca Mangold: Were you able to pass that question along to Mr. Trump for his evaluation or decision?

Madeleine Westerhout: Um, this was included in the stack of checks. So, by -- yes. I passed it along in the sense that I gave him this note.

Rebecca Mangold: And was it your understanding that Mr. Trump individually approved the amount of this invoice?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Can we now show the jury what is in evidence as People's Exhibit 75?

Rebecca Mangold: Do you recognize this?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes. It's an email exchange between Rhona and myself.

Rebecca Mangold: Can we focus on the bottom half of this page, please? Q Looking now at the email at the bottom of this email on the chain, who is that from and to?

Madeleine Westerhout: From me, to Rhona.

Rebecca Mangold: Was it dated, the email?

Madeleine Westerhout: June 20, 2017.

Rebecca Mangold: What's the subject line?

Madeleine Westerhout: "Photo."

Rebecca Mangold: Can you read the content to the jury?

Madeleine Westerhout: "This is what I have."

Rebecca Mangold: Do you remember what this email pertained to?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes. I believe this was in relation to a photograph that Mr. Trump -- that President Trump wanted to put in a frame to put behind his desk in the Oval Office. So, behind the Resolute Desk, there was a little credenza, and as time went on, he put pictures of his family behind him.

Rebecca Mangold: Can you read Ms. Graff's response to you about that in the email chain?

Madeleine Westerhout: "Wow. I never saw this one. And in color too. It's not one of the photos I gave to Lara Trump. I'm trying to find out what happened to those. In answer to your question, however, I don't have any empty Tiffany frames. I could go to Tiffany's next door and get one with the account we have with them."

Rebecca Mangold: Can you read your response?

Madeleine Westerhout: "If you don't mind doing that, that would be wonderful. He did mention a Tiffany frame."

Rebecca Mangold: Can you read Ms. Graff's response?

Madeleine Westerhout: It says: "Please note that the frames are on the pricey side. About $650 minus 15 percent discount. Does DJT want to spend that much?"

Rebecca Mangold: What do you understand "the frames" were "on the pricey side" to mean?

Madeleine Westerhout: That they were more expensive.

Rebecca Mangold: When it says, "Does DJT want to spend that much?", who does "DJT" refer to?

Madeleine Westerhout: President Trump.

Rebecca Mangold: In your experience, is this the type of thing Mr. Trump would want to weigh in on?

Madeleine Westerhout: I don't recall any other instances of this. I know this one was important and special because it was a photo of what I remember to be his mother, so he wanted a nice frame for that.

Rebecca Mangold: Was it unusual for Mr. Trump to weigh in on expenses of this amount?

Madeleine Westerhout: I don't recall any other instances like this.

Rebecca Mangold: Do you remember if you passed this question on to Mr. Trump?

Madeleine Westerhout: I don't. We may have made the executive decision without his approval.

Madeleine Westerhout: Sorry, sir.

Rebecca Mangold: Was it your understanding that this is the type of thing Ms. Graff would want Mr. Trump to look at?

Madeleine Westerhout: I really -- I don't know. I think she may have -- I don't know. I'm sorry.

Rebecca Mangold: Focusing on early 2018, do you remember a story coming out about Mr. Trump and a woman named Stormy Daniels?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Do you remember Mr. Trump's reaction to that story?

Madeleine Westerhout: I remember he was very upset by it.

Rebecca Mangold: Do you recall if Mr. Trump spoke to Michael Cohen around the time the story came out?

Madeleine Westerhout: Um, I believe they spoke around that time, yes.

Rebecca Mangold: In your position as Mr. Trump's Executive Assistant, did you interact with Mrs. Trump?

Madeleine Westerhout: I did, yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Were you familiar with their relationship?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: How would you describe their relationship?

Madeleine Westerhout: I -- I believe they have a relationship of mutual respect. Um, I -- I just found their relationship really, um, special. I know he cares a lot about her opinion. There was really no one else that could kind of put him in his place, too. So, he was my boss, but she was definitely the one in charge. But, I -- I just remember thinking that their relationship was really special.

Madeleine Westerhout: They laughed a lot when she came in to the Oval Office. Um. And he would, you know, once in a while tell me to call her and let her know that he was running late. Just like any other marriage. Like, "Honey, I'm going to be late for dinner." She would call me sometimes and say, "It's past dinnertime. When is my husband coming home?" So, I just really respected their relationship.

Rebecca Mangold: Did anything about their relationship change after the Stormy Daniels story came out?

Madeleine Westerhout: Not that I saw, no.

Rebecca Mangold: At some point, did you leave the White House job?

Madeleine Westerhout: I did.

Rebecca Mangold: Can you, very briefly, describe the circumstances surrounding your departure?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes. In August of 2019, I was invited by a White House colleague of mine to what I understood to be an off-the-record dinner. And at that dinner I said some things that I should not have said. That mistake, eventually -- ultimately, cost me my job. And I am very regretful of my youthful indiscretion. But I feel like I've learned a lot from that experience.

Madeleine Westerhout: I think I've grown a lot since then. [Crying]. Sorry. [Witness crying.]

Rebecca Mangold: Do you need a minute?

Madeleine Westerhout: No. I'm okay.

Rebecca Mangold: Did you end up writing a book about your experience?

Madeleine Westerhout: I did, yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Can we please show the witness, the parties, and the Court, People's Exhibit 392 for identification?

Note: [Whereupon, the exhibit is shown on the witness' and the parties' screens.]

Rebecca Mangold: Do you recognize this?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes. That's the cover of my book.

Rebecca Mangold: Is it an exact copy of the cover?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Rebecca Mangold: The People now offer Exhibit 392 in evidence.

Juan Merchan: Any objection?

Susan Necheles: No objection.

Juan Merchan: 392 accepted into evidence.

Note: [Whereupon, People's Exhibit 392 is received in evidence and is shown on the screens.]

Rebecca Mangold: What is the full title of your book?

Madeleine Westerhout: It is called Off the Record, My Dream Job at the White House, How I Lost It and What I Learned.

Rebecca Mangold: Why did you write the book?

Madeleine Westerhout: Um, I wrote the book because I -- I needed time to process what I had just been through. But, I also wanted to document for myself and my family the incredible experience that I had had working in the White House. Um, I also felt it was really important to share with the American people the man that I got to know. [Crying]. Um, I thought it was really important to share with the American people the man that I got to know.

Madeleine Westerhout: I don't think he's treated fairly, and I wanted to tell that story. [Crying].

Rebecca Mangold: Have you spoken to Mr. Trump since the publication of your book?

Madeleine Westerhout: Since the publication, yes.

Rebecca Mangold: Can you briefly describe that for the jury?

Madeleine Westerhout: Um, I -- he was at a fundraiser in Orange County, where I lived, last Fall. And I hadn't seen him since I left the White House. And so I called one of his aides. [Crying].

Rebecca Mangold: Did you discuss this case at that time?

Madeleine Westerhout: No, I did not. I called one of his aides and asked if I could come to the fundraiser to say hello, and they said yes. So, I got to see him then. [Crying].

Rebecca Mangold: Have you spoken to him since that time?

Madeleine Westerhout: No.

Rebecca Mangold: No further questions.

Juan Merchan: Your witness.

Susan Necheles: Do you want to take a short break?

Juan Merchan: No. We stop at 4 o'clock today.

Note: [Cross-examination by Susan Necheles.]

Susan Necheles: Ms. Westerhout, you were very young when you were working at the White House, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: You made a mistake, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: President Trump forgave you, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: He did.

Susan Necheles: Your book, in fact, was very flattering about him, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yeah. I didn't have anything negative to say, so why would I write it?

Susan Necheles: You thought he was a great person to work for?

Madeleine Westerhout: I did, yes. And he was.

Susan Necheles: And you thought he was a good President?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes. [Crying].

Susan Necheles: Are you ready to go on?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: So, during the 2016 election, before President Trump actually won the Republican nomination, you were working for the RNC?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: In fact, he was not your choice?

Madeleine Westerhout: No.

Susan Necheles: He only became your choice once you got to know him, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes. That's right.

Susan Necheles: So, once he won the election, you started working to help the transition, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And you still didn't know him, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Uh-uh, no.

Susan Necheles: But, before the transition, there was the Access Hollywood tape that you were asked about on direct examination, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And you testified on cross that it rattled the RNC leadership, correct?

Madeleine Westerhout: That was my -- that's my recollection, yes.

Susan Necheles: There were a couple of days of consternation, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: That happened all the time during the campaign, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yeah.

Susan Necheles: There's always some event that causes total consternation for a couple of days, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And when President Trump was running for election, there was always some event that everybody said, [claps twice], "That's it, he's not gonna win," right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And everybody around would be freaking out, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yeah.

Susan Necheles: But not President Trump, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: No.

Susan Necheles: He did not freak out about any of this, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Not that I was aware of.

Susan Necheles: He just kept his mind straightforward and kept running for the election, right?

Rebecca Mangold: Objection.

Juan Merchan: Overruled. You can answer.

Madeleine Westerhout: Can you repeat that?

Susan Necheles: He kept working and running to win the Presidency, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: After the Access Hollywood tape came out, some of the people freaked out, right, in the RNC?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And President Trump did not freak out, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: No.

Susan Necheles: He gave a video statement, am I correct?

Madeleine Westerhout: Not that I remember, but I trust you.

Susan Necheles: Okay. Do you recall him giving a public statement, saying he had -- that this was locker room talk and apologizing for that locker room talk?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes, I do.

Susan Necheles: And he said, "And I look forward to seeing everybody at the debate"?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yeah.

Susan Necheles: And the Access Hollywood tape uproar blew over in a couple of days, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yeah.

Susan Necheles: And after that, President Trump won the election?

Madeleine Westerhout: He did.

Susan Necheles: Now, the transition was an extremely busy time for President Trump, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: He had to fill hundreds of positions, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: Those were in his cabinet, correct?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And other high-level positions, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And he had to figure out what those positions were, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And he had to find candidates to fill those positions, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And then he had to interview all those people, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And part of your job was to help find those people and pre-vet them, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Um, yeah -- yes. At least schedule the interviews. I don't know if I was involved in finding them or vetting them. But, scheduling their interviews, yes.

Susan Necheles: Were you involved in helping create briefing papers?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes. I believe -- I think I did a lot of them. Yes.

Susan Necheles: And those were multiple-page documents, lengthy documents that would be given to President Trump or President-Elect at that point?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: So he could read them and be ready to interview these people, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Uh-huh. Yes.

Susan Necheles: You were scheduling as much as three interviews a day for President Trump with these high-level people, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: Those would be lengthy interviews, correct?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: The prosecutor just asked you on direct examination whether the press called you "the greeter girl", right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yeah.

Susan Necheles: And they did that because you would go downstairs in Trump Tower and escort people up, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes. Trump Tower was in the middle of Midtown Manhattan. It's protected by Secret Service. And these people were coming in for the most important interviews of their lives. So, I took it upon myself to greet them downstairs so they wouldn't get lost.

Susan Necheles: Them calling you "the greeter girl" was a little bit belittling your work, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yeah. I tried to not let it get to me. But -- I think people said I was unqualified.

Susan Necheles: Because you were doing work that was a lot more important than just greeting people, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: But, that's how the press treated you at that time, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And that's what the prosecutor just asked you about, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: [No response].

Susan Necheles: On direct, she asked you if you were called "the greeter girl"?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: This is a very busy and hectic time, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: President Trump was also transitioning his companies at that point into a Trust, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Not to my knowledge. But --

Susan Necheles: So, you were not involved in his business?

Madeleine Westerhout: No.

Susan Necheles: What was going on in his business?

Madeleine Westerhout: No.

Susan Necheles: You were involved in just the political side, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: But, you are aware he was also running a substantial business until he became elected President, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And you knew he had to put that all to the side and just move to become President, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And he only had a month-and-a-half to do that?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yeah. November, December -- yeah. Two-and-a-half months.

Susan Necheles: Two-and-a-half months to do all of that, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Uh-huh.

Susan Necheles: And you were asked on direct examination --

Susan Necheles: One minute, Judge.

Susan Necheles: After the transition, you moved to the White House, correct?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And that was the first time you were really working closely with President Trump, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: What was that like?

Madeleine Westerhout: Um, it was amazing. Um, I think -- I, um, yeah. I really had not spent any time with him. But, I don't know if anybody should feel like they deserve to be in the West Wing, but he made me -- he never once made me feel like I didn't deserve that job and I didn't belong there. Especially in an office filled with older men.

Madeleine Westerhout: Um, he never made me feel like I didn't -- I didn't belong there. Um, he was a really good boss. He -- I hope he respected me in my job and -- yeah. I just found him very enjoyable to work for.

Susan Necheles: And you were asked some questions on direct examination about the way that President Trump interacted with his family. Do you recall those questions?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And he had a close relationship with his children, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Very close, yes.

Susan Necheles: And he cared a great deal for them, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Definitely.

Susan Necheles: And you also said he had a -- you observed him, that he had a close and lovely relationship with his wife?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: Isn't it true that you would also see them, sort of, personally communicating during the day in some way?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes. Um, sometimes I would look down on my phone, and if the red light was on, I knew that he was on the phone, but I hadn't placed the call. So, if he was sitting in the Oval Office, I would kind of look up and look into the Oval Office, and there were times when I could kind of figure out that he was on the phone with Mrs.

Madeleine Westerhout: Trump. And he would say, you know, "Honey, come over to the window." And there was a window in the residence where you could see from the residence into the Oval Office. And he would say, "Come to the window," and they would kind of wave to each other [waves]. When he was, you know, boarding Marine One on the South Lawn, he would call Mrs.

Madeleine Westerhout: Trump and say, "Honey, I'm about to board," which I always found funny. Like, of course she knows his schedule. He just wanted to say hi and check in.

Note: [The following proceedings are continued from the following page.]

Note: [Continued direct examination by Susan Necheles.]

Susan Necheles: You were asked if the first year of the Presidency was a transition year, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And you said it was particularly hectic, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And some days President Trump would work from 6:00 a.m. in the morning?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes, uh-huh.

Susan Necheles: And sometimes he wouldn't go home until very late at night?

Madeleine Westerhout: That's right.

Susan Necheles: And all day he would be taking calls, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Oh, yes, uh-huh.

Susan Necheles: And meeting with people?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And you said he was reading documents and reviewing them?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes, uh-huh.

Susan Necheles: And he was also signing a tremendous amount of documents, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes, uh-huh.

Susan Necheles: And there was a lot of things that he was doing that you didn't really know the details of, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes, absolutely.

Susan Necheles: And you were asked by the Prosecutor if you were -- if you coordinated with The Trump Organization during that first year by asking questions of The Trump Organization employees, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: The person that you coordinated with most was Rhona Graff, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: And this did not have to do with The Trump Organization business, did it?

Madeleine Westerhout: No.

Susan Necheles: It had to do with his personal affairs, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes, uh-huh.

Susan Necheles: For example, you needed his contact list, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes, uh-huh.

Susan Necheles: You didn't know who he would want to get calls from, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: That's right.

Susan Necheles: And you didn't know the phone numbers of people, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: No.

Susan Necheles: And you needed his calendar from before, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: I don't think I needed his calendar. But, yeah, yeah, a lot of things that you would think, like, as a new Executive Assistant you would get. But there was no transition into the White House so Rhona was very helpful.

Susan Necheles: So that first year you spent a lot of time talking with Rhona Graff, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: Yes.

Susan Necheles: But you did not spend time talking with The Trump Organization employees to coordinate business of The Trump Organization, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: No, uh-uh.

Susan Necheles: It was just personal aspects for President Trump, right?

Madeleine Westerhout: That's correct.

Susan Necheles: Is this a good time to break, your Honor?

Juan Merchan: Yes. Is this a good time.

Susan Necheles: Yes.

Juan Merchan: All right. Jurors, we will stop at this time. I will remind you to please not talk either among yourselves or with anyone else about anything related to the case. Please continue to keep an open mind. Do not form or express an opinion about the defendant's guilt or innocence until all of the evidence is in, and I have given you my final instructions on the law, and I have directed you to begin your deliberations.

Juan Merchan: Do not request, accept, agree to accept, or discuss with any person the receipt or acceptance of any payment or benefit in returning for supplying any information concerning the trial. Report directly to me any incident within your knowledge involving an attempt by any person improperly to influence you or any members of the jury.

Juan Merchan: Do not visit or view the premises or place where the charged crime was allegedly committed or any other premises or place involved in the case. And do not use any program, or electronic device to search for and view any of the locations discussed in the testimony. Do not read, view or listen to any accounts or discussions of the case.

Juan Merchan: That includes the reading or the listening to the reading of any transcripts of the trial, or the reading of posts on any Court sites. Do not attempt to research any fact, issue or law related to the case. Please do not communicate with anyone about the case by any means, including by telephone, text messages, email or the internet.

Juan Merchan: And please do not Google or otherwise search for any information about the case, or the law which applies to the case, or the people involved in the case. I will see you tomorrow at 9:30. Have a good night.

Court Officer: All rise.

Juan Merchan: Please be seated. Thank you. You may be seated. Thank you. You can step down. Thank you.

Note: [Witness excused.]

Juan Merchan: All right. Let's take ten minutes and then we will pick it up with Mr. Blanche.

Todd Blanche: Yes, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: Mr. Blanche, I understand that there are three different issues that you want to take up?

Todd Blanche: Well, yes, your Honor. Although the good news is that there is now only two.

Juan Merchan: All right.

Todd Blanche: My understanding is that -- well, the People informed me that they no longer intend to call Ms. McDougal. So that will -- we no longer need to discuss that.

Juan Merchan: Okay. Good.

Todd Blanche: The other two issues -- the first is with respect to the Gag Order as it relates to Ms. Daniels. We ask that President Trump be allowed to respond publicly to what happened in court the past day and a half. And this will tie into the motion that I'm about to make for a mistrial. But the press reporting over the past 24 hours about -- about what -- about the current version of the story that we believe is completely false, and that President Trump has said is completely false since the first time it has been mentioned, is completely different in kind than the denials and the story that has come forward as far back as 2011, as 20 -- 2018. And it is significant because, for example, on the news last night, there was -- and this is just one example, and there are many -- one of the supposed participants in that evening, the friend of Ms. Daniels who supposedly was returned -- she got a phone call from the room that there was testimony about.

Juan Merchan: Yes.

Todd Blanche: She was on television last night talking about what happened and also corroborating what Ms. Daniels said. This was on a political show with political commentators then commenting about the seriousness of, again, this new, false allegation, right. So it's not -- this isn't President Trump, again, being able to say this never happened, this isn't true.

Todd Blanche: It's now him having to not be able to respond to this new version of events that now deals very deeply with a very different issue than a sexual event that took place in 2006. And so, you know, as we said repeatedly -- and I'm not going to dwell on it -- but, you know, this is about -- he needs an opportunity to respond to the American people.

Todd Blanche: And the reasons for the Gag Order as they relate to Ms. Daniels are over. She's no longer a witness. And as it relates to other witnesses in the case, your Honor, we are towards the end of the case, I can be corrected by the People, but I believe that the only significant witness left -- that's the wrong word -- the only witness that is really the subject of the Gag Order is Mr. Cohen.

Todd Blanche: And so, as far as the Court's concern about this proceeding, it should give way to the testimony of the past couple of days. I mean, he's going to be asked repeatedly over the next week or two about these new accusations of consent and of what happened that night. And as the Gag Order stands now, he's not allowed to say, "I did not do that." So there are voters out there and there are questioners who will ask him questions about it, and he can't say anything.

Todd Blanche: His -- the other side can say things. And they already have. There are numerous news articles about it. Many articles, your Honor, today, just based on yesterday. I haven't checked the news today. But there is no doubt that there will be a feature of political shows tonight and articles. And it cannot be that he cannot respond to that, your Honor, now that she's off the stand, especially because this isn't just the same story that has been going around for the past several years.

Todd Blanche: It's much different. And so we would ask that he be removed from the Gag Order as it relates to Ms. Daniels and that he be able to respond.

Juan Merchan: All right. Let me hear from the People.

Christopher Conroy: Thank you, Judge. And it seems as though the other side lives in almost an alternate reality. First of all, there is not another side out there. There is a proceeding here that this Order is designed to protect. And I think it has been somewhat effective thus far. And I think we have to look back as to why it was issued in the first place, to put in context what's going on here.

Christopher Conroy: This Order was issued to protect the witnesses, the citizens participating as jurors, all the people participating in this proceeding, and the very proceeding itself. This is where facts are brought out. This is where, if somebody wants to respond to something that's said in this room, that can happen in this room.

Christopher Conroy: It's not supposed to happen out there. There are people out there saying things about Ms. Daniels and other witnesses, clearly saying them with the defendant in mind. I'm not in a position to say that it's at his direction or anything close to that. But there are people making the defendant's case for him out in the world.

Christopher Conroy: We have been told repeatedly by witnesses, even in the courtroom, even on the stand, we have seen the fear in some of these witnesses. The witness who just testified, a couple of times broke in because there was an exhibit displayed on the screen that had her home address. And you could see the fear in her eyes when that happened.

Christopher Conroy: It was luckily not displayed to the public. And that's because of what this defendant is doing. It's what he has done in the past. It's why this Order was issued. The Order was not issued lightly. It was issued after we developed an extensive record relating to the attacks this defendant mounts indiscriminately for anyone that he deems worthy of his venom.

Christopher Conroy: He does it selfishly, with no concern about the safety of the people he is attacking. And, unfortunately, we have seen the results. Among the evidence the People submitted, in a room that formed the basis of the two Orders restricting extrajudicial statements, was evidence of the significant safety consequences of the defendant's public attacks.

Christopher Conroy: We submitted an affidavit from the head of the DANY -- the DA's Office Executive Protective Detail about the explosion and threat cases lodged by the NYPD against the DA, his family, members of the Prosecution, their families. Your Honor has seen firsthand, as I talked about the very real consequences for witnesses when they express fear in the courtroom.

Christopher Conroy: I had a conversation with a witness last night, a custodial witness, somebody who is coming in to put in records, who is concerned about safety. And that's not the only witness like that. They are not witnesses who have a huge stake in this, and they are worried about it. The fact that witnesses are brave enough to come in here, under subpoena, tell the truth under oath, shouldn't expose them to this defendant's barrage of threats that will put them and potentially their families in danger.

Christopher Conroy: Modifying this Gag Order now, in the middle of trial, would signal to future witnesses that they could be at risk as well. In affirming the D.C. Court's Gag Order in the D.C. criminal case, the D.C. Circuit relied on exactly this point. That Court held, and I quote here: "Common sense and common human experience teach that hostile messages regarding evidentiary cooperation that publicly relate to high profile witnesses have a significant likelihood of deterring, chilling or altering the involvement of other witnesses in the case itself." "The undertow generated by such statements does not stop with the named individual.

Christopher Conroy: It is also highly likely to influence other witnesses." Here, we have other witnesses. We have a jury. This is a proceeding that's going on. Some of these Orders have involved proceedings where we weren't even on trial yet. Here we are on trial. This Order is not designed just to protect the witness until they are done on the stand and then they walk out the door and they have no protection.

Christopher Conroy: And it's not just designed to protect the proceeding part of the way. I also just wanted to point out, we saw a quote from this defendant an hour and a half ago that sort of addressed that exact point. He said: "You attack people because other people see you doing it, and it sends a message." That's his words on that screen today.

Christopher Conroy: And that's what he's doing here. Modifying the Gag Order now to allow the defendant to attack Ms. Daniels -- and that's what he wants to do. Let's not pretend he wants to engage in high-minded discourse, and to thereby put her at risk would seriously risk jeopardizing the integrity of these proceedings. We understand -- well, I will leave it there.

Christopher Conroy: Thank you.

Juan Merchan: All right.

Todd Blanche: I mean, Judge, just briefly. Everything that you just heard is different in kind from our request. We are not talking about all kinds of threats that witnesses may be hearing from others besides President Trump, or a witness' concern for her safety testifying, or his safety testifying in this environment, which is understandable, having nothing to do with President Trump.

Todd Blanche: What we're saying is that in this case, on a narrowly-tailored Gag Order, the Court should constantly be making sure that its terms should remain in effect. And you have Ms. Daniels, who came in here yesterday and today, and was allowed to talk about a completely different version of events. And, yes, we discredited her.

Todd Blanche: And I am going to turn to that in minute.

Juan Merchan: When you are saying a completely different set of events, what specifically are you referring to?

Todd Blanche: Your Honor, there are several.

Juan Merchan: Look, just give me the main one.

Todd Blanche: I will give a handful. So, for example, she testified at Transcript Page 2610 yesterday about the incident, where she said: "At first I was just startled. Like jump scared. I wasn't expecting someone to be there. He's, essentially, minus a lot of clothing. That's when I had this moment where I felt the room spin in slow motion.

Todd Blanche: I felt the blood basically leaving my hands and my feet and almost like if you stand up too fast, and everything kind of spins. That happened too. Then I just thought, oh, my God, what did I misread to get here? Because the intention was pretty clear." Now, what she had previously said and, again -- now I'm getting more to the mistrial motion.

Todd Blanche: But, the only reason why her testimony was admissible, according to the Court's ruling prior to trial, was to President Trump's motive and intent, the coconspirator's motive and intent, and what they knew at the time. So their motive and intent was based off of, among the articles and what she was saying publicly at the time, which is that: "Ugh, here we go. We started kissing.

Todd Blanche: I hope he doesn't try to pay me." Okay.

Juan Merchan: So I don't understand how that's a different alternate set of facts?

Todd Blanche: One is about consent and one is not, your Honor. I mean, that's the issue, your Honor. One is about --

Juan Merchan: Right. So there is some crossover between this and the motion for a mistrial. I'm trying to keep it narrow. I'm trying to deal with just one issue at a time. I know that there will be crossover. So let me address this first issue, and then I will hear you on the second one.

Todd Blanche: Understood. The other -- another example of something that we heard on the stand today, but is not part of what was previously said about this incident and what happened next, briefly, this is Transcript Page 2611 to 12: "I think I just -- I just think I blacked out. I was not drugged. I never insinuated that I was on drugs.

Todd Blanche: I was not drunk. I never said anything of that sort. I just don't remember." And then, very shortly later, Transcript Page 2613 --

Juan Merchan: I'm going to stop you just in the interest of time. You will be able to make your arguments for the motion for a mistrial. I want to stick, again, just to this first issue. I don't see what you are referring to as a new set of facts, as a new theory of the case. Please have a seat.

Todd Blanche: Yes, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: Look, in response to your request that I modify the Gag Order so that your client can respond to Ms. Daniels, it's interesting what Mr. Conroy said, because I actually wrote the same thing down when I was reading that portion of the book. My concern is not just with protecting Ms. Daniels, or a witness who has already testified.

Juan Merchan: My concern is with protecting the integrity of these proceedings as a whole. That means that everybody sees what happens. Witnesses who have not yet testified will see what happens. They will see how witnesses who have testified are going to be treated by your client. So, the portion that I wrote down was where your client is attributed with saying "because other people will see you doing it." And that's my concern.

Juan Merchan: Other witnesses, including not only Michael Cohen, but these other witnesses that Mr. Conroy referred to, will see your client doing whatever it is that he intends to do. And I can't take your word for it that, no, no, this is going to be low key, this is not going to be an attack, this is just going to be a response to what was said, because that's just not the track record.

Juan Merchan: The reason why the Gag Order is in place, to begin with, is precisely because of the nature of these attacks. The vitriol, these were very real, very threatening attacks on potential witnesses. So the track record, your client's track record speaks for itself. I can't take your word for it that he will just say, hey, I dispute the facts.

Juan Merchan: Now, I continue to be concerned about the witnesses using the Gag Order as a sword instead of a shield. And I will continue to be mindful of that. And I will continue to keep an eye out for that, but that's not what I see happening here right now. And that's not the argument that I see you making. So, with regard to your application for me to modify the Gag Order to allow your client to respond to Ms. Daniels, that application is denied.

Juan Merchan: I will hear you on the motion for a mistrial.

Todd Blanche: Your Honor, we started this conversation yesterday. I made a motion yesterday, and I am making another motion today. We are also prepared, if it's helpful to the Court, as we go through this, to put something in writing over the weekend that further articulates why we believe that there is simply no way that this case should go forward given the testimony that happened, the past day with Ms. Daniels.

Todd Blanche: It's worth -- we mentioned it yesterday, but it's worth mentioning it, that in your Honor's decision of March 18th on Page 4, when you are explaining why Ms. Daniels testimony is admissible at this trial, you, the Court says: "Daniels not only completes the narrative of events that precipitated the falsification of business records, but is also probative of the defendant's intent." "Further, the evidence and testimony surrounding these individuals is inextricably intertwined with the narrative of events and is necessary background for the jury.

Todd Blanche: We then, thereafter, your Honor, put in a motion for an adjournment based upon, in part, on Ms. Clifford's recent change of story. And we alerted the Court and the Government that Ms. Daniels was now making additional claims, contradicting her previous claims that were made at the time that the NDA was entered into, claiming that the -- that this, you know, again, completely made-up encounter with President Trump may have been non-consensual.

Todd Blanche: And we got that from the documentary that was recently released and from a few pages of notes from December when the People met with Ms. Daniels and gave us the notes. And then, as the Court knows, before the testimony started, we objected again. And the Court allowed -- indicated it would allow testimony about it, but said that it was fine, but we don't need to know the details of the intercourse, and Ms. Hoffinger said that's correct.

Todd Blanche: And then, what proceeded to happen was a whole host of questions that went way beyond just mere fact that it happened. And it included questions from the transcript at Page 2592 asking about the fact that Ms. Daniels had a difficult time growing up. And, again, that was objected to, and it was sustained, but that's a question that should have never been asked.

Todd Blanche: And she then is questioned about President Trump spanking -- being asked to be spanked during the incident. Again, how that's relevant to why we're here, when you -- especially when you weigh it and compare it to the prejudicial nature of that sort of testimony. It almost defies belief that we're here about a records case and the Government is asking questions about an incident that happened in 2006, which we deny even happened, and a series of questions about rolling up a magazine and spanking him.

Todd Blanche: The Court then warned the Government at the break and said that the degree of detail that we're going into here is unnecessary, we don't need to know the details, what the suite looked like or anything like that, please move along more quickly. And the Government said, Okay. They did not do that, your Honor.

Todd Blanche: Instead, they -- there was extensive testimony -- and, again, this is extremely prejudicial testimony. This is not a case about -- this is not a case about sex. This isn't a case about whether that incident took place or didn't take place. Presumably, the NDA can be entered and was entered. We completely denied it. Ms. Daniels said it happened, the NDA was entered.

Todd Blanche: Whether it happened or not has nothing to do with the charges in this case. And it continued on. At Page 2609 of the transcript, there was a question asked about what the inside of the bathroom looked like, right. And you will hear, your Honor, when I'm just highlighting some of the questions that were asked, this isn't a witness that was out of control.

Todd Blanche: This was a question that was answered in response to the Government's question of what the bathroom looked like inside, and she answered the question. A little bit later on, I already read it to the Court in response to the Gag Order, the question was: "What was your reaction to seeing him like that?" Now, before the -- before the witness took the stand, there was direction given by the Court about limiting that.

Todd Blanche: There was additional direction by the Court after the break about moving expeditiously through this. And there is an open-ended question about what your reaction was to seeing him like that. There is a very long answer that, again, is completely different than the story that Mr. Cohen, that AMI knew about, Dylan Howard, Gina Rodriguez, the story that they had been told about in 2016, when they were presumably negotiating and determining what -- whether to pay for this story.

Todd Blanche: That's not the story that they were told. So, it's not relevant, and it shouldn't have been asked. And I already read that. I'm not going to reread it again. And then, it didn't stop there. Page 2610 of the transcript onto Page 2611, there is a long question about what happened when she exited the bathroom.

Todd Blanche: And this is where, again, she said something not anywhere near the story that was told, supposedly, to Mr. Cohen. She says: "I went to step around. I laughed nervously, tried to make a joke out of it and to step around to leave. Even though I was moving like I was in a funhouse, like slow motion. I thought to myself, great.

Todd Blanche: I put myself in this bad situation. Like, what did I do? How did I misread everything? He stood up between me and the door. Not in a threatening manner. He didn't come at me. He didn't rush at me. He didn't put his hands on me or nothing like that. I said, I got to go. He said, I thought we were getting somewhere.

Todd Blanche: We were talking. I thought you were serious about what you wanted, if you ever want to get out of that trailer park." Now, again, that is a power description. That is an extremely prejudicial statement by a witness that was never said to -- there is no evidence that that was said to AMI. There was no evidence that that was said to Mr. Cohen.

Todd Blanche: There was no evidence that that had anything to do with the motive of anybody involved in this case to enter into that NDA in 2016. On the other hand, it's just extraordinarily prejudicial for a jury to hear. Shortly thereafter, 2611 to '12, the question is: "What happened next, briefly?" Okay. There has already been testimony -- the Court was clear with the Government to not go into more than just the fact that it happened.

Todd Blanche: But, they didn't abide by the Court's rules. "What happened next?" And the witness says, "I think I blacked out. I wasn't drunk. I just don't remember." And then there was the questions that we talked about yesterday, about how -- the size, how tall was he. So, there is a question: "So, he was standing up and you were standing up. What were your relative heights?" How is that relevant to this case?

Todd Blanche: That is so prejudicial, and so incredible for a jury to hear the Government ask a witness talking about what she's now saying is a power move by the person who she's having sex with, okay. And the DA says: "Well, what were your heights," knowing the answer. Now, we didn't know the answer because we didn't get any notes from their prep except for one from December.

Todd Blanche: But, they knew the answer because there was no surprise when she said, "I'm 5'6", I don't know how tall he was, but several inches taller and much larger." Okay. Now -- and then there was a question about the -- whether a -- at 2613, about whether she felt threatened and the answer was, "No. Not physically." And then she describes how threatened she felt. "Although I did note there was a bodyguard right outside the door.

Todd Blanche: There was an imbalance of power for sure." I mean, that is -- I mean, you have jurors who are now hearing about an imbalance of power between a man and a woman. And none of that information is information that goes to the motive of anybody in this case, including President Trump, because it's not any information that she was saying at the time, which is the only reason that evidence is coming in, your Honor.

Todd Blanche: And, then, even though your Honor had said that, clearly, that that's fine -- this is the transcript at Page 2511, before the witness took the stand: "We don't need to know the details of the intercourse." But the People still asked. And then the People said: "Can you very briefly describe, you know, where you had sex with him?" She describes it. In detail.

Todd Blanche: Right. And I'm not going to read all of the whole answer. But it's 2613 and '14. And, again, I don't know what -- I mean, our understanding of the Court's motion in limine for why this evidence was coming in and then your Honor's instructions, there was no basis for the Government to ask that question, given what the testimony was offered for, your Honor.

Todd Blanche: And then the People didn't stop there. They asked whether she remembers how her clothes came off. And the answer was no. And the question -- and, again, presumably the Government knows this is coming -- says, "Is that a memory that has not come back to you?" Again, that is so prejudicial to suggest that there was an event where -- again, I mean, nothing to do with this case and why we're here.

Todd Blanche: And the answer, that was an objection sustained, but it's the question that should never have been asked. Thereafter, the Government wouldn't stop. They said: "Do you have a recollection of feeling something unusual that you have a memory of?" There is no reason for that question, your Honor. That should not have been asked.

Todd Blanche: And, you know, we didn't know these questions were coming. We didn't know. And that's -- you know, we had a sense from her documentary that she was changing her story. And we alerted the Court, and we alerted the Government, but we were sitting here, hearing that for the first time on the witness stand yesterday.

Todd Blanche: And then, finally, at 2615: "What, if anything, did you remember other than the fact that you had sex on the bed?" The answer: "I was staring at the ceiling. I didn't know how I got there. I made note like I was trying to think about anything other than what was happening there."

Juan Merchan: And there was an objection, and it was sustained.

Todd Blanche: Excuse me, your Honor?

Juan Merchan: And there was an objection, and it was sustained.

Todd Blanche: Judge --

Juan Merchan: In fact.

Todd Blanche: Judge --

Juan Merchan: In fact, after many of these anecdotes, there were objections and they were sustained.

Todd Blanche: There was an objection and it was sustained. That doesn't excuse the conduct and doesn't excuse the questions being asked. Especially with your Honor's ruling, especially knowing full well that the jury hears the question, hear's the answer, and then objection is sustained. I mean, Judge, that's why this type of evidence is so dangerous and so prejudicial and borders on a problem from the beginning, which is why the Court was very careful in allowing it in for a specific purpose and, further, very careful about telling the Government that they're limited in what they can ask.

Todd Blanche: And then the questions about wearing a condom. Judge, now, in that situation, the significance of that is -- and, again, we didn't know this was coming. But, a few minutes earlier, the questions had been elicited about her job and about how and why she went to work for a particular company, the only company in the industry where a condom is mandatory, and so then eliciting that there wasn't a condom -- and, again, that has nothing to do with the false business records, but is so prejudicial.

Todd Blanche: It's a dog whistle for rape.

Juan Merchan: All right. I mean, let me hear from the People, please.

Todd Blanche: I have many, many more, but I will stop.

Juan Merchan: I appreciate that, but let me hear from the People.

Joshua Steinglass: Okay. So that was a lot that Mr. Blanche said. Most of it just flat out untrue. Starting with the fact that this is a new account. This is not a new account. This account has been documented in many previous interviews, which the defense has had access to, and used somewhat effectively and somewhat misleadingly on cross-examination.

Joshua Steinglass: Not the least of which is, at least half the things that Mr. Blanche has said that they didn't know was coming are included in the exhaustive typed interview notes that were taken in a December interview with Ms. Daniels, and shared with counsel promptly after that interview. Those details were elicited in the Anderson Cooper interview.

Joshua Steinglass: They were elicited in numerous other interviews, all of which the defense has access to. So the claim of ambush is just nonsense. The claim of changing the story is also extraordinarily untrue. There may be, as with any witness recounting a story, details that are said in one forum, but not in the another forum.

Joshua Steinglass: Things that were, you know, omitted in an interview that was given for entertainment purposes versus an interview that was given for, you know, a more fulsome interview with Anderson Cooper in 2018 versus an interview in preparation for trial testimony, which is more detailed than any of those things, versus a documentary.

Joshua Steinglass: All of which the defense has had access to. So, our first point here is that this is not a change of story, as they have tried to characterize it. Second of all, to the extent that there were inconsistencies, Ms. Necheles -- certainly, Ms. Necheles certainly probed them in her very narrow, but somewhat misleading cross-examination.

Joshua Steinglass: You will remember that she, in an attempt -- she attempted to impeach Ms. Daniels with three or four inconsistencies or omissions from the Anderson Cooper interview, which were allowed. We attempted to put in the rest of that interview to show just how similar her testimony was to the account that she gave Anderson Cooper in 2018. And I'm not going to reargue the ruling, I understand the Court's ruling on that.

Joshua Steinglass: But, the fact of the matter is, is Ms. Necheles led a very misleading impression, as Mr. Blanche is doing now, that her story has somehow become radically different from the way that it always was. So, moving on to the actual mistrial motion. It has always been the People's contention that the details in this case, the details of the two-hour conversation that Ms. Daniels had with the defendant in the living room and the dining room of his hotel room in Harrah's corroborate her account.

Joshua Steinglass: They corroborate, A, the fact that sex happened, which increases the motivation to silence her. I will point out a few things. Well, the point here is that the details of her story, both before and during the sexual act corroborate her story. That is the -- those are the kind of details that make her account more credible.

Joshua Steinglass: Now, the defense has gone through great lengths to try to discredit her, to try to claim that the sex never happened. And, incidentally, if they want to offer testimony of the fact that the sex never happened, that's their prerogative. However, they have -- they opened on, and this is Page 96 of the transcript, referring to Stormy Daniels: "She was paid so she would not spread false claims about Mr. Trump." They opened also on Page 905 to 906 of the transcript: "Ms. Clifford has publicly denied any improper relationship in writing." Page 906 of the opening: "Her testimony will be salacious." Now, this is all coming from the defense.

Joshua Steinglass: And so, they are basically trying to have their cake and eat it too. They are trying to discredit Ms. Daniels by claiming in their opening that her story is false and then preclude the People from eliciting the very details that can corroborate that account because they have the ring of truth. Ms. -- Mr. Blanche gives a couple of examples and thinks that these questions were totally out of left field.

Joshua Steinglass: For example, he raises the question about the spanking incident that Ms. Daniels relayed during her testimony. And Ms. Daniels also testified that when she came out of the bathroom in Mr. Trump's -- the bathroom off of Mr. Trump's bedroom, that he was lying on the bed and the first thing that went through her head was: "How did I misread this?" "How did I misunderstand these clues?" "How did I think this was about a business meeting?" And you can bet that if we didn't draw the sting and elicit the spanking incident, that Ms. Necheles would have cross-examined her: Oh, really?

Joshua Steinglass: You spanked him? You didn't think that there was anything sexual about that. So we needed to give her a chance to explain that, to prevent them from undermining her credibility. Similarly, Mr. Blanche complains about eliciting the fact that Mr. Trump did not wear a condom during their sexual encounter. Now, if you remember the testimony, and part of the reason the testimony was elicited about the conversation that preceded the sexual encounter, is that Mr. Trump seemed -- asked a lot of questions about the testing in the adult film industry: How often the testing happens, whether performers are required to wear condoms, et cetera, questions about that.

Joshua Steinglass: And the reason -- the reason that that's relevant is because it explains his decision to not wear a condom. And the fact that testimony about him not wearing a condom comes out is because the description of the conversation that she had with Mr. Trump, again, corroborates her story. So what seems like a detail that is insignificant and irrelevant to Mr. Blanche is not, as Ms. Necheles' cross made perfectly clear, cherry-picking the details that she thought were inconsistent and omitting the details that have always been consistent.

Joshua Steinglass: So the overarching point here is that the details are essential to give the jury the tools they need to analyze her credibility. And presenting only a generalized account undermines her reliability as a witness because it affects her ability to perceive and remember these details. And Mr. Blanche complains about the fact that these details are messy.

Joshua Steinglass: But, the point is -- and Mr. Blanche says, well, she never said any of this to Michael Cohen or AMI in 2016. She didn't speak to Mr. Cohen or AMI in 2016. But you know who knew what happened in that room? Mr. Trump knew. And those details of what happened in that room, those messy details, that is motive.

Joshua Steinglass: That was Mr. Trump's motive to silence this woman before she could tell her story in 2016, less than a month before the election. So, these are not -- this is not irrelevant. Mr. Trump was aware of those details. And the fact that the testimony is prejudicial and messy, according to Mr. Blanche, that is why Mr. Trump tried so hard to prevent the American people from hearing about this.

Joshua Steinglass: Notwithstanding all of that, we went out of our way to eliminate the most salacious details in order to avoid embarrassing the defendant, even though some of those details are highly corroborative. And, you know, there was a fair amount of detail elicited about the room outside, the conversation, the two-hour conversation that Ms. Daniels had with Mr. Trump.

Joshua Steinglass: But do you know where there was not a lot of detail elicited? The actual sexual encounter. By my count, there are about eight questions about it. Most of them are yes or no answers. There is no opportunity for long explanations about it. We tried very hard to respond to your Honor's efforts to pull back the testimony and to not have a fulsome description of the actual sexual act.

Joshua Steinglass: And, you know, despite the fact that the details of that sexual act would corroborate her story, they were not elicited. I will give you an example. I believe your Honor sustained the objection here, at one point Ms. Daniels was asked, you know: "Did you feel anything unusual?" Now, the answer to that question was going to be: "I felt what it felt like to feel the skin of a 60-year old man.

Joshua Steinglass: I was 27 years old. And that was a different -- that was different than anything I had ever felt before." Now, that's the kind of detail that would corroborate her account of having a sexual interaction with the defendant, but was not elicited. Your Honor sustained the objection. There are other details that I don't want to put on the record.

Joshua Steinglass: I'm happy to make an ex parte -- or not an ex parte, a sealed record about some of the very salacious details that were deliberately omitted, notwithstanding the fact that they are highly corroborative because we did not have the desire to embarrass the defendant. So Mr. Blanche, in his application, is conflating the significant level of detail that was elicited about the pre-encounter, the conversation, the relatively harmless conversation that happened in the dining room and living room, but not details about the sexual encounter.

Joshua Steinglass: And that's what -- the adjustment that we made to be responsive to your Honor's concerns that we not go too far into the details of the sexual encounter. I'm going to say one more thing about this, which is the argument -- this argument was thoroughly briefed by the defense in their endeavor to keep this testimony out, as well as similar testimony about Karen McDougal and Dino Sajudin.

Joshua Steinglass: And, by the way, about Karen MacDougal, we didn't change our minds about calling her. She was on our witness list, but we had never indicated an actual intention to call her. I am just correcting Mr. Blanche. We had never affirmatively indicated that we were going to call her. She was like many people on our witness list.

Joshua Steinglass: Anyway, back to what I was saying. This issue was thoroughly briefed. And the Court, mindful of the potential prejudice, limited the details of the Karen McDougal and Dino Sajudin story to just the fact of the allegation and not the underlying details, but did not make a similar limitation on the Stormy Daniels story because, as the Court recognized, it was so intertwined with the motive to silence her.

Joshua Steinglass: I'm just going to read very briefly from your Honor's ruling.

Juan Merchan: Which ruling are you referring to?

Joshua Steinglass: I'm referring to your decision on the defendant's motion in limine, which is at Page 3 and 4, I believe, the decision was issued on March 18th or 19th. What your Honor wrote was: "In the instant matter, testimony from or regarding Sajudin, McDougal and Daniels may be introduced." "The probative value of the evidence is evident.

Joshua Steinglass: For example, the actions of the three individuals allegedly flow directly from the 2015 meeting at Trump Tower where Pecker, Cohen and defendant were present. Their testimony qualifies under several of the Molineux exceptions." I'm skipping a little bit. "Locating and purchasing the information from Daniels not only completes the narrative of events that precipitated the falsification of business records, but is also probative of the defendant's intent." "Further, the evidence and testimony surrounding these individuals is inextricably intertwined with the narrative of events and is necessary background for the jury." Your Honor went on to distinguish between Karen McDougal and Dino Sajudin: "However, when carefully balancing the probative value of testimony against the potential for undue prejudice, the Court believes that the testimony from or about Sajudin and McDougal must come with some limitations.

Joshua Steinglass: Unless the People provide a satisfactory offering of proof, the testimony by or about Sajudin and McDougal will be limited to the fact of, and may not explore the underlying details of, what allegedly transpired between those individuals and the defendant." And we honored that ruling. That limitation did not apply to Stormy Daniels, although the defense asked that it did.

Joshua Steinglass: I'm only saying this to say that we feel that we have very faithfully adhered to your Honor's rulings and even took additional details out of the questions that we had planned on asking Ms. Daniels as a result of your Honor's -- the conversation that we had at the bench before she began testifying, when the defense renewed their motion.

Joshua Steinglass: All of this to say, is that the defense has not alleged anything remotely approaching grounds for a mistrial. And their motion should be denied.

Juan Merchan: Thank you. All right. Following the motion --

Juan Merchan: What, Mr Blanche?

Todd Blanche: Just very briefly.

Juan Merchan: Very briefly.

Todd Blanche: I mean, Judge, what they are saying is not true. So, for example, the People just told you that Ms. McDougal was not on the witness list --

Juan Merchan: I'm not going to get bogged down on that.

Todd Blanche: But, Judge --

Juan Merchan: It's not relevant to this motion. That's why I'm saying, very quickly, whether she was going to be called or not going to be called has nothing to do with this motion for a mistrial.

Todd Blanche: But it does, your Honor.

Juan Merchan: No, it doesn't. I am making the ruling, and I decide whether it does or it doesn't. I'm telling you, it doesn't. Please have a seat so that I can render my decision. Following your motion for a mistrial on Tuesday, I went back to chambers and I pulled out my decisions on both motions in limine, the omnibus decision.

Juan Merchan: I also looked at the transcript from Tuesday's proceedings. I looked at that yesterday. And I went back to just make sure that everyone had followed my guidelines and that there were no inconsistencies, and to just make sure that no one had violated my rulings. After having done so, after reading, again, both sets of motions, both decisions and the motions in limine, the Omnibus Motion and the transcripts, I came away satisfied that -- let me backup.

Juan Merchan: You will recall in my decisions, both in the motions in limine and the omnibus motions, that while I did decide on many of the issues, there were some that I said we are going to have to see how the evidence comes in. And at every trial, the evidence comes in in a different way and it's very, very difficult to anticipate.

Juan Merchan: So sometimes a Court has to change its rulings. Sometimes there has to be a certain amount of flexibility. Why do I say that now? Because in going back to the very opening statements, and I'm looking at Pages 897, 905, 906. Mr. Blanche, in your opening statement, you deny that there was ever a sexual encounter between Stormy Daniels and the defendant.

Juan Merchan: And, again, I direct you to Page 897. Your denial puts the jury in a position of having to choose who they believe: Donald Trump, who denies there was an encounter, or Stormy Daniels, who claims that there was. Although the People do not have to prove that a sexual encounter actually did occur, they do have the right to rehabilitate Ms. Daniels' credibility and to corroborate her story, which was immediately attacked on opening statements.

Juan Merchan: The more specificity Ms. Daniels can provide about the encounter, the more the jury can weigh to determine whether the encounter did occur and, if so, whether they choose to credit Ms. Daniels' story. Now, there is more to say about the details. You will recall that I commented on the details on Tuesday.

Juan Merchan: And I will get to that in a minute. I direct your attention to pages 2508 and 2511 of the transcript, having to do with Ms. Daniels' story, but we continue. Ms. Necheles claimed when you made your motion for a mistrial that she did not object more or earlier or more frequently because she believed that my ruling at the bench had prevented her from doing so. That's not correct.

Juan Merchan: In fact, if you look at the transcript, you will see that Ms. Necheles actually objected very early on. Look at Page 2592. So she can't say that she didn't object because of my ruling when, in fact, she did object at 2592. However, there were many times, not once or twice, but many times when Ms. Necheles could have objected, but didn't. And, here, I will direct your attention to Pages 2598 and 2610. Now, after the Court sua sponte objects, and that objection had to do with the reference to the trailer park, I felt that wasn't necessary.

Juan Merchan: I felt that there was a certain amount of prejudice to that. There was no objection, so I sua sponte objected. I didn't want that in. And then I struck it from the record. Following the Court's own objection, Ms. Necheles then began to object with some frequency. And virtually every single one of her objections was sustained.

Juan Merchan: And every one of her applications that the answers be stricken from the record were, in fact, stricken from the record. And I direct your attention now to Pages 2612 through 2615 for that. Yet, for some unexplained reason, which I still don't understand, there was no objection to certain testimony, which was later used in the motion for a mistrial on Tuesday, and again used today.

Juan Merchan: For example, the mention of the condom. I agree that shouldn't have come out. I wished those questions hadn't been asked, and I wished those answers hadn't been given. But for the life of me, I don't know why Ms. Necheles didn't object. She had just made about ten objections, most of which were sustained.

Juan Merchan: Why on earth she wouldn't object to the mention of a condom? I don't understand. We continue. Ms. Daniels made clear in her testimony, and I direct you now to Page 2611, that she was not drunk or drugged or in any way coerced. Again, this is Page 2611. And for some reason, I don't know why, you went into it ad nauseam on cross-examination.

Juan Merchan: I had sustained any objections related to that. The witness herself had backed off and said, hey, listen, I don't mean to suggest for a second that this was coerced or forced in any way. She backtracked immediately when she heard how that might have sounded. And for some reason, today, I don't know how much time Ms. Necheles spent on this, on cross-examination, drilling it over and over and over again into the jury's ears.

Juan Merchan: I don't understand the reason for that. With regard to your concerns about this, the numbness in the hands and this feeling that she didn't know what was going on and the room spinning, you will recall that at a bench conference, Ms. Hoffinger asked that the People be permitted to ask a question about a moment that came years later, with what was referred to as a Bombshell moment, and that that would explain a lot of the things that she had not mentioned originally, that she had remembered later on, and some of her emotions that she was feeling, I asked Ms. Hoffinger, what are you referring to? What are you talking about?

Juan Merchan: And she said she was specifically referring to the movie Bombshell. And which is -- which chronicled Roger Ailes and certain allegations of sexual -- of a sexual nature made against him. And, apparently, Ms. Daniels had watched this movie years later and it was at that point that certain memories came back and certain explanations came back to her for her feelings.

Juan Merchan: I ruled immediately that that could not come in. I felt that to somehow inject Roger Ailes into these proceedings would be unduly prejudicial to your client and I did so even though these feelings of the numbness of hands, the room spinning, the blacking out went unexplained. And I did that to protect your client.

Juan Merchan: I disagree with your narrative that there is any new account here. I disagree that there is any change in story. What's happened is people have gone into more detail than they originally planned. And I do agree that certain details, although I may have originally disagreed on Tuesday, certain details such as the color of the floor tiles, the description of the furniture in the bathroom, the weight of the furniture, these details add a sense of credibility if the jury chooses to believe them.

Juan Merchan: And the fact that you went after her right on opening statements, attacking whether -- attacking, your claim that they never had sex, you didn't attack that there was a falsification of business records, you didn't attack any of the other elements of the offense, you said my client denies that there was ever a sexual encounter.

Juan Merchan: Again, as I said before, right off the bat, that puts your client's word against Ms. Daniels' word. And that, in my mind, allows the People to do what they can to rehabilitate her and to corroborate her story. Your motion for a mistrial is denied. I will see you tomorrow at 9:30.

Note: [Whereupon, at this time, the matter was adjourned to Friday, May 10th, 2024, at 9:30 a.m.]
