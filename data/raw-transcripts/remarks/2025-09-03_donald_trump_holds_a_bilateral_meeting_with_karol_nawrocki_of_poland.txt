Donald Trump: Thank you very much. It's a great pleasure to have President Nawrocki with us. Poland. He -- did a good job with that, right? Give me a little different pronunciation. I said I want to get it perfect. I want -- did I get it right?

Karol Nawrocki: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Good.

Karol Nawrocki: Nawrocki. Very good.

Donald Trump: [Inaudible] And the president's been amazing. He had an incredible race. He came from behind and he won very handily. The people of Poland have taken to him immediately. They really love him. There's great love and respect. He's a very successful man, but he was -- he went into a political hatchet, so to speak.

Donald Trump: It was a pretty tough race, pretty nasty race and he beat them all and he beat them all very easily. And now he's become even more popular as they got to know him and know him better. He's doing a really fantastic job, so it's an honor to -- I also endorsed him. So I'm very proud of that. I was -- I don't endorse too many people, but I endorsed him and I was very proud of that.

Donald Trump: The job he's done. I want to thank Vince Haley for that recommendation. Vince was fantastic and I appreciate it. And I can tell you who really appreciates it, Poland, because they're very happy with their president. And I just want to say it's an honor to have you. We'll be discussing trade and various other things, the things that you discuss.

Donald Trump: We'll have a few questions from you and then we'll get on to a discussion that we'll have lunch and then he goes and he meets with the Pope and that'll be very exciting. Say hello to the Pope for me.

Karol Nawrocki: Yeah, I will. Thank you.

Donald Trump: Thank you very much.

Karol Nawrocki: Thank you very much.

Donald Trump: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

Karol Nawrocki: Mr. President, thank you very much and I would like to express my gratitude for your invitation only after one month from my sworn -- in sworn and from celebration for my inauguration. It means that the Polish-American relations are very important, very strong. I think that we have so strong relations that we have never had.

Karol Nawrocki: And it's very important for me, our relations are based, of course, on the values.

Donald Trump: Right.

Karol Nawrocki: Thank you very much for your support, for your endorsement during my very hard campaign. And I remember it and I'm very grateful for your support. It was the fight me against others, so your support was very important. And the support of Polish people, polish diaspora in the United States of America, we have almost or more than 10 million people here and they voted for Donald Trump.

Donald Trump: They voted for me. Yes. [Laughter]

Karol Nawrocki: In vast majority, they voted also --

Donald Trump: They did --

Karol Nawrocki: For me. So I would like to say hello to Polish diaspora in the United States of America. Those relations for me, for Poland for Poles are very important with the United States of America and they are based on values independence, sovereignty, democracy. And I think, Mr. President, that those values are epitomized -- epitomized by our common heroes.

Donald Trump: Yes.

Karol Nawrocki: Casimir Pulaski and Tadeusz Kosciuszko.

Donald Trump: That's right.

Karol Nawrocki: So thank you very much and I hope it will be very fruitful discussion around energy, around the economy, and military service.

Donald Trump: And the flyover was very much in honor of your great pilot who just passed away recently, who was a legend in Poland. You might want to say something about him.

Karol Nawrocki: Yes, of course. It was a terrific accident in Poland. Thank you for this gesture, that F-35 opened our meeting. Major Krakowian was one of the best Polish pilots, well honed Polish pilots, and he died. He lost two children. So it was a great tragedy.

Donald Trump: He was a legend in Poland, actually.

Karol Nawrocki: He was.

Donald Trump: A legend as a pilot. He was an incredible pilot. And I think he went to the Air Force Academy, actually, but he was a fantastic pilot. And it was a big -- a big setback, a big -- people of Poland are very, very sad. So we thought we'd do that. That was the single plane that swooped up and --

Karol Nawrocki: Machines. American machines opened our meeting. It was great. And we are waiting for 32 F-35s in Poland. So it also shows that we have great relations according to the best military equipment in the world, American equipment, which revealed Polish security, too.

Donald Trump: Well, Poland, we've had a tremendous relationship. I think now it's better than ever because of this relationship, but it's a little special because we fought together. But we've always been very good and we have some wonderful people, as you know, due to my friend. He's a good -- he's a good man and still a big fan of yours, very much so. So it's a great honor and we're going to talk about trade, we'll talk about some other things.

Donald Trump: We'll take a couple of questions from the media.

Question: President Trump, will American soldiers -- will American soldiers remain in Poland?

Donald Trump: Say it?

Question: Will American soldiers remain in Poland?

Donald Trump: Yeah, I think so. I mean, do you know something I don't? I don't know. [Laughter] And we're very happy.

Question: Any policy --

Donald Trump: If anything, we have -- we'll put more there if they want, but they've long wanted to have a larger presence. We have some countries that have more, not too many. But no, they'll be staying in Poland. We're very much aligned with Poland.

Question: Thank you. [Inaudible] we saw a dramatic picture where we saw the leaders of Russia and North Korea and China together, the first time the leaders of those three countries have been together to sort of show solidarity. You said that they're conspiring against the United States. What do you think they're conspiring to do? And given this is a reason why you should slap or would consider slapping secondary sanctions on Russia if they're conspiring against the US now?

Donald Trump: Well, I've already done that with regard to India and we're doing it with regard to other things. And I put out a Truth last night, you saw that, and I was the one that brought it up. I said they're only doing this to really -- they're looking to -- when they -- when they did what they did, I thought it was a beautiful ceremony.

Donald Trump: I thought it was very, very impressive, but I understood the reason they were doing it and they were hoping I was watching and I was watching. My relationship with all of them is very good. We're going to find out how good it is over the next week or two. I think that we helped China very much, as you know, when they talk about freedom and I don't believe that -- and maybe I'm wrong.

Donald Trump: I hope I'm wrong, but I don't believe that America, that the United States was acknowledged for helping China to get to gain its freedom. But perhaps that was just a -- that was a sleight of hand. I mean, I was very -- I was very surprised. I watched the speech last night. President Xi is a friend of mine, but I thought that the United States should have been mentioned last night during that speech because we helped China very, very much.

Question: Invited you, Mr. President -- do you think they should have invited you? You've expressed many times, your frustration and disappointment with Putin, but there's no action since you took your office. Don't you worry that --

Donald Trump: How do you know there's no action?

Question: But don't you worry -- what actions have you taken?

Donald Trump: Who are you with?

Question: I'm with Polish Radio.

Donald Trump: OK. How do you know there's no action? Would you say that putting secondary sanctions on India, the largest purchaser outside of China, they're almost equal -- would you say there was no action? That cost hundreds of billions of dollars to Russia. You call that no action? And I haven't done phase two yet or phase three.

Donald Trump: But when you say there's no action, I think you ought to get yourself a new job. Because if you remember, two weeks ago, I did -- I said, if India buys -- India's got big problems and that's what happened. So don't tell me about. Go ahead.

Question: Mr. President, right now, there have been survivors of Jeffrey Epstein speaking at a press conference on Capitol Hill. They're calling for these case files, these documents to be released. And Thomas Massie, who's sponsoring a discharge petition to get the House to vote on the release of the documents, says he doesn't believe you're implicated in these files, but many of your friends and donors may be. And he says that's why the Justice Department is redacting them and slow walking the release.

Question: Is the Justice Department protecting any friends or donors, sir?

Donald Trump: So this is a Democrat hoax that never ends. You know, it reminds me a little of the Kennedy situation. We gave him everything, over and over again, more and more and more and nobody's ever satisfied. From what I understand -- I could check, but from what I understand, thousands of pages of documents have been given.

Donald Trump: But it's really a Democrat hoax because they're trying to get people to talk about something that's totally irrelevant to the success that we've had as a nation since I've been president. Even if you look at DC right now, DC, it's a totally safe zone. It's called a safe zone. That's a -- that's a term -- it's a term of art.

Donald Trump: It's a safe zone because it's very safe. You can walk down the street now and nothing's going to happen, no crime, no murders, no nothing, because we had a lot of problems with certain places. And we still do, all run by Democrats or for the most part, run by Democrats. So what they're trying to do with the Epstein hoax is get people to talk about that instead of speaking about the tremendous success like ending seven wars.

Donald Trump: I ended seven wars. Nobody's going to talk about because they're going to talk about the Epstein, whatever. I understand that we were subpoenaed to give files, and I understand we've given thousands of pages of files. And I know that no matter what you do, it's going to keep going. And I think it's -- I think -- really, I think it's enough because I think we should talk about the greatness of our country and the success that we're having.

Donald Trump: I think we're probably having, according to what I read, even from two people in this room, we're having the most successful eight months of any president, ever, and that's what I want to talk about. That's what we should be talking about, not the Epstein hoax.

Question: When are you going to make a decision on Ukraine, Mr. President? What's [Inaudible] message to Putin? Mr. President, [Inaudible] message to Putin?

Donald Trump: I have no message to President Putin. He knows where I stand and he'll make a decision one way or the other. Whatever his decision is, will either be happy about it or unhappy. And if we're unhappy about it, you'll see things happen.

Question: On Venezuela, can you give us a sense of what the US policy, or what you're trying to achieve with the aircraft carriers, or the boats I should say, near Venezuela? And also, the boat that you mentioned yesterday where 11 people were killed, what was found on that boat and why were the men killed instead of taken into custody?

Donald Trump: On the boat, you had massive amounts of drugs. We have tapes of them speaking. There was massive amounts of drugs coming into our country to kill a lot of people. And everybody fully understands that. In fact, you see it. You see the bags of drugs all over the boat and they were hit. Obviously, they won't be doing it again.

Donald Trump: And I think a lot of other people won't be doing it again when they watch that tape. They're going to say, let's not do this. We have to protect our country and we're going to. Venezuela's been a very bad actor. They've been -- as you know, they -- they've been sending millions of people into our country, many of them Tren de Aragua, some of the worst gangs, some of the worst people anywhere in the world in terms of gangs.

Donald Trump: And we had some in Washington, DC. We took care of them very quickly, but they're out of here, they're gone. But Venezuela has been very bad both in terms of drugs and sending some of the worst criminals anywhere in the world into our country. They emptied out -- you don't know this, but they emptied out their prisons in Venezuela and they emptied them out into the United States of America, and that's part of the problem we have.

Donald Trump: We're getting them out. We're getting them out rapidly, but it's caused a tremendous problem. And Pete and all of the people that are working very hard to rectify the stupidity of the Biden administration allowing these people to pour into our country with open borders. We are paying a big price as a country for the incompetence of the Biden administration.

Donald Trump: But think of it opened up prisons, drug dealers, drug lords, everything coming out of Venezuela, they said -- and we said, we're not going to put up with it anymore. So Venezuela has been one of the worst actors in the whole group and we have a group of pretty bad actors.

Question: Are you wanting to -- are you wanting to force Maduro --

Donald Trump: Go ahead.

Question: Yeah, thank you, Mr. President. At the end of this month, the government or the Congress has to pass a budget. Do you think we can avoid a government shutdown?

Donald Trump: Yeah, I do. I think the Republicans will vote for an extension. We won't have any Democrat votes. We could give the greatest budget ever, a tax cut of 50 percent, everybody taking care of perfect for women, perfect for men, perfect for minorities, perfect for everything, and we wouldn't get one vote for the Democrats because they've lost their mind.

Donald Trump: They are so deranged. They have Trump derangement syndrome and I don't want to burn the Republican Party with it, but they really are. They've become almost sick. You know, they actually think -- there is a disease, it's called Trump derangement syndrome. They've got it. No matter what we did, no matter how good, you could give them everything that they've ever dreamed of and you wouldn't get one vote.

Donald Trump: These are sick people and I think we're going to have a tremendous midterm. We just approved the largest tax decrease in the history of our country. We have things -- when you think of it, no tax on tips, no tax on Social Security for our seniors, no tax on overtime, deductions when you buy a car and you borrow money to buy a car.

Donald Trump: First time they've ever seen anything like this, middle income people get deductions. You get a deduction when you buy a car, nobody's ever seen. And by the way, they're selling cars like crazy. Cars are pouring back -- because of the fact that we have tariffs, cars are pouring back into our -- or car plants, are pouring back into our nation.

Donald Trump: They're coming from all over the world. They're coming back. You know, we lost about 54 percent of automobile manufacturing over a 30-year period, 35-year period. They're all coming back. I think they're coming back higher than ever before. We have AI going up. What we've done is amazing and what we've passed is amazing.

Donald Trump: But the Democrats, I don't believe we'll get one vote. It's very anti-crime. We want anti-crime, they're in favor of crime. We're against crime. You know, they gave us things like men playing in women's sports, open borders for everybody, transgender for everybody. I mean, they wanted transgender for -- all of the crazy things that they were saying.

Donald Trump: And you know, people would say they're 80/20 issues. I say there were 97 to three. I would say 97 to three and nobody knows who the three are. This is the biggest issue of all they are against preventing crime. They are fighting us. I want to go into Chicago and I have this incompetent governor that doesn't want us. Do you know that this weekend, 72 people were shot in Chicago?

Donald Trump: I'm embarrassed to say it in front of the President of Poland. 11 people were killed, 72 people were shot. Last week, seven people were killed in Chicago, a place which is probably your number one place. I hate to say it.

Karol Nawrocki: Yeah, a lot of Polish [Inaudible]

Donald Trump: And we got to keep it safe. But seven people were killed. The week before that, five people were killed and 21 people were shot. This is in three weeks. So in three weeks, I lost almost -- almost 35 people were killed. It could have been stopped. If you look at Washington, DC, three weeks ago, it was the same or worse and now it's considered a totally safe zone.

Donald Trump: Restaurants are open, they're bustling. Restaurants, you have to see, restaurants were dying. Nobody wanted to go out. They didn't want to be attacked. They didn't want to be mugged. They didn't want to be attacked even in the restaurant and you take a look at what's happened. Friends of mine that haven't gone to a restaurant in four years.

Donald Trump: One -- one of them went out five times in the last two weeks to a restaurant with his family. They feel totally safe. Washington, DC is a totally safe city. You're not reporting any crime because there is none. They said crime is down 87 percent and I said no, it's not. It's down 100 percent. We have a great thing going.

Donald Trump: I could do that with Chicago. We could do that with New York. We could do it with Los Angeles. So we're making a determination now. Do we go to Chicago or do we go to a place like New Orleans where we have a great governor, Jeff Landry, who wants us to come in and straighten out a very nice section of this country that's become quite, you know, quite tough, quite bad.

Donald Trump: So we're going to be going to maybe Louisiana and you have New Orleans, which has a crime problem. We'll straighten that out in about two weeks. It'll take us two weeks. Easier than DC. But we could straighten out Chicago. All they have to do is ask us. To go into Chicago, if we don't have the support of some of these politicians -- but I'll tell you who is supporting us: the people of Chicago and I sort of want them to let it be known.

Donald Trump: They have incompetent people. A guy like Gavin Newsom, he's the governor of a state that if we didn't go in, if we didn't go into Los Angeles with our soldiers with our National Guard, you wouldn't even be having the Olympics there. They were going to take it. And remember this: your top law enforcement officer in Los Angeles said there's no way we could have done this without President Trump coming in with the troops.

Donald Trump: We saved Los Angeles and we saved the Olympics. Thank you very much.

Question: Mr. President -- [Inaudible] -- [Inaudible] -- Thank you. Thank you. Mr. President, in regards to Gavin Newsom, would you be open to congressional investigation in regards to the specific Palisades fire that killed 12 seniors to see if there's any negligence on Gavin Newsom or Karen Bass in regards to those deaths?

Donald Trump: Well, I tell you, there's negligence on not getting people permits. That is negligent. We got all of the federal permits. Lee Zeldin. The federal permits are much more difficult. They were all gotten within 30 days. People could go build their houses. It's going to be years before they are allowed to build their house.

Donald Trump: And Karen Bass is grossly incompetent. And Newsom, he's -- this is a very incompetent guy. I watched him with the hands. I'm saying what's going on with the hands. There's something wrong with -- there's something wrong with him. Do you watch him? There's something wrong with this guy. But more importantly, he didn't allow the water to come from the Pacific Northwest.

Donald Trump: You know, they have tremendous amounts of water in California. People don't know. They send the water out to the Pacific Ocean. So I demand that it be open. If that were open during the fire, before the fire, you wouldn't have had the fire because all the sprinklers would have worked in the houses. They had no water.

Donald Trump: They had no water in the fire hydrants. You wouldn't have had the fires. It would have been put out after one house, two houses, but he stopped the water from coming in. And I had to send in the military to have that water opened after the fires. And now they have water, but he should have more because he's -- they've restricted.

Donald Trump: They still restricted. There's something wrong with these people. There's something really wrong. As to investigation, I view it as a gross incompetence. I view it as an ideology that's wrong. It's a radical left ideology. And if I didn't win this election, I think our country would be destroyed. I don't believe you'd be here right now and our country would be destroyed.

Question: Mr. President --

Question: Mr. President --

Question: [Inaudible] --

Question: [Inaudible] --

Donald Trump: Go ahead, please

Question: Mr. President Trump, thank you, sir. What's the most important branches of interests between Poland -- Poland and US, in your opinion?

Donald Trump: Well, it's just the relationship we have. I think there's a great trust and a great -- more than, you know, more than most countries, more than almost any countries. We have some in a category that's very special, and Poland is in that category. We have a very special relationship. It's like the question about the soldiers that was asked.

Question: Has he --

Donald Trump: We never even thought in terms of removing soldiers from Poland. We do think about it with regard to other countries, but we would never know. We're -- we're with Poland all the way and we will help Poland protect itself.

Karol Nawrocki: Thank you.

Question: Mr. President --

Question: Mr. President --

Karol Nawrocki: I would like to add something. Yeah, of course security is most important also for -- for our relation. And I'm a historian. As you know, maybe Mr. President knows.

Donald Trump: Sure.

Karol Nawrocki: I'm historian and this is the first time in Polish history in 20th century and the 21st century that the Poles are happy that we have foreign soldiers in Poland. So the American soldiers are the part of our society nowadays. We have almost 10,000 soldiers and this is the signal to all world and also to the Russian Federation that we are together.

Karol Nawrocki: But we are not like the Poland free riders in Europe and in NATO. Mr. President Trump knows it because our GDP for military service achieved 4.7. So we are probably the one NATO nation which is on this level. And we will not stop. Me as the President of Poland, we are going to achieve five percent of GDP for military service, but with American soldiers on Polish soil, we solidified and we are secure.

Question: Mr. President -- Mr. President -- [Inaudible] --

Donald Trump: Just about that, you know, Poland was one of two nations that paid more than they were supposed to with NATO. I don't know if anyone knows that, but there were two nations and Poland paid more than they were supposed to. They thought it was low. And by the way, since then at my request, they've raised it from two percent to five percent.

Donald Trump: But Poland was one of two nations that paid more than they were supposed to, which was a very nice thing. Yeah?

Question: President Nawrocki -- President Nawrocki -- [Inaudible] --

Question: [Inaudible] You were not invited to the parade in Beijing.

Donald Trump: Never even thought about it until just now.

Question: President Nawrocki, what's your message for President --

Donald Trump: Never even thought -- I would -- it wouldn't have been my place to be there.

Question: President Nawrocki, what's your message for --

Question: On tariffs? On tariffs? Will you visit a restaurant in DC? You haven't gone to --

Donald Trump: I might. Sure.

Question: You haven't gone to one in either of your terms. That wasn't in your --

Question: How do you know? How do you know?

Question: Because I and many others --

Donald Trump: Do you want me to prove you wrong? Do you want me to prove you wrong?

Question: Yes, please.

Donald Trump: But I will -- I think it's something we could consider doing. I'd love to do it. I love the White House food, but after a while I could see going to a nice restaurant. It's safe. If you would have said like the governor, Governor Moore wanted me to go and walk through Baltimore with him. And I said, you know, I'm -- I think I'm a brave guy, but it -- there's no reason to be stupid.

Donald Trump: They have crime that's at levels that nobody's ever seen before in Baltimore. They've done a terrible job. We'd go into Baltimore, straighten it out very quickly, too. You know why they respect our soldiers, you see our soldiers, they respect our soldiers. We'd go there, too. But we're going to have people asking us to go, they're going to want to -- and I think the people of those places are -- the politicians are not in tune with the people.

Donald Trump: The people in Chicago, the people in Baltimore, the people in all of the places we talk about, they want to see us there and I think we're pretty much waiting until we get asked and properly.

Question: President Nawrocki --

Question: President Nawrocki --

Donald Trump: We're doing them a big service. Yeah, please.

Question: President Nawrocki --

Question: You talked about how historic these tariffs have been bringing in revenue, additional revenue for our country. You've also mentioned before they could possibly replace federal income tax --

Donald Trump: Possibly.

Question: Do you think -- do you think that --

Donald Trump: Someday it's possible. It used to be. So if you go back to 1913 is when they ended tariffs. We were the richest ever from 1850 -- it was all tariffs. We didn't have income taxes from 1850 to 1913 In the 1887s, about 1887, they had the Great National Tariff Act and it was a group of people that got together because our country was so rich.

Donald Trump: They didn't know what to do with the money. We had so much money, they didn't know what to do. It was a group of very prominent people that were set up to hand out money to everybody because we were the richest we ever were. Proportionately, we were, in 1887, around that time -- even in 1913. We ended them in 1913. How did that work out?

Donald Trump: And then we went to the income tax system and then we had the depression. And by the way, a lot of people try and say that, oh, tariffs with the depression, no. They ended in 1913 And then we went to income tax. And then in 1929 you had the depression, they did try and bring it back in 1931, '32, but the depression had long started.

Donald Trump: And -- and this poor beautiful nation was gone. It was gone. We suffered for 25 years, took 25, 30 years to really recover from the depression. And we don't ever want to see that happen again. The tariffs are vital to the success of this country. When I say I ended seven wars, at least half of those wars were ended because of the power of tariffs.

Donald Trump: I was able to say, well, we're not doing any business with you or if you're going to war, we're putting a tariff on you and all of a sudden they announced that the war was settled. I would settle -- I settled seven different wars. One going 31 years. One -- look at the Congo and Rwanda, look at that. Thirty-one years, 10 million people dead.

Donald Trump: I got it settled and a little bit of that one, less than in some cases, had to do with trade and had to do with tariffs. So you know what I'm saying, tariffs are vital to our country. And just so you know, other countries use them on us. But I just used them a lot better. We're in a much better position.

Donald Trump: We have trillions of dollars coming into our country. If we didn't have tariffs, we would be a very poor nation and we would be taken advantage of by every other nation in the world, friend and foe. We're not going to let that happen. And we have a very, very big case in the Supreme Court. I can only say this, our country has a chance to be unbelievably rich again, but it can also be unbelievably poor again.

Donald Trump: If we don't -- if we don't win that case, our country is going to suffer so greatly, so greatly.

Question: [Inaudible] sir.

Donald Trump: But I think we're going to have a big victory. Even if you look at the people that brought the case, they're foreign-oriented. They're foreign. Countries have taken advantage of the United States for so many years. And I started with China. You know, last term I took in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs from China.

Donald Trump: But when COVID came, the last thing I was going to do is we're going to tariff France and Italy and, you know, others, Spain, when they were doing so badly. But now, we made a deal with the European Union where they're paying us almost $1 trillion, and they're happy to do it. You know what, they're happy.

Donald Trump: It's done. These deals are all done. I guess we'd have to unwind them. We've done deals with Japan, with South Korea. We've done deals with many countries and others to come. And if we didn't have the power, prestige and dignity of tariffs -- and I used them wisely and people respect America again and we've become a rich country again.

Donald Trump: The money coming in is incredible. And again, they use them on us. If we didn't have them, they would use them on us and we would have no way to fight them. We would be a third world nation. So I think it's one of the most important cases I've ever seen go before the Supreme Court of the US.

Question: You gave Vladimir Putin a two-week deadline to agree to talks with Vladimir Zelenskyy. That deadline is now nearly approached. Can you give us any indication of when you will make a decision?

Donald Trump: Well, I'm having a conversation with him very shortly and I'll know pretty much what we're going to be doing. We've taken very strong action, as you know. and in other ways, we've taken very strong action. But I'll be speaking to him over the next few days and we're going to see.

Question: With whom, sir?

Donald Trump: I'm going to know exactly what's happening.

Question: Mr. President --

Donald Trump: But I'm not happy with all the people. You got 7,819 people killed last week, Russian soldiers and Ukraine soldiers, right? Not American soldiers, not soldiers from Poland, but they're human beings. They're souls. They have parents, they wave goodbye to their parents and the parents never see them again and that's the end of them, over a stupid war, and I want to see it stopped.

Donald Trump: Now, we have stopped the money. I send -- we send weapons to NATO. They pay full price. We don't -- you know, Biden spent $350 billion, so stupidly and it was one of the reasons that this whole thing happened. A big -- a big reason this war happened was sitting right in these chairs, this one in particular.

Donald Trump: So I -- I think that -- I think we're going to have a good solution, but they're losing soldiers at levels that nobody has seen since the Second World War. This is the worst conflict, and it's just going on and on. It's -- one's defense, one's offense. The offense moves a little bit, just a little bit. You take a look.

Donald Trump: They move inches. They're dropping bombs and killing everybody. The whole thing is -- not since the Second World War. Has there been anything even close to this and they're not -- again, they're not soldiers from my country. This is my country. But I have a power to end things. That's why I was able to end seven other wars.

Donald Trump: And you know that I thought of the seven, basically seven, those were tough wars to end, much tougher I thought, than the war with Ukraine and Russia. I thought that Ukraine and Russia -- I have a very good relationship with President Putin. I thought that that would be much easier. I thought that would be in the middle of the pack, maybe one of the easiest.

Donald Trump: Sometimes you never know with war. You know, war is a very interesting thing. You never know with war. War is complex and dangerous and -- and what a mess, what a bloody mess. It's going to get -- it's going to get done. One way or the other, but they have to stop killing all of these souls. They're souls and we have to stop killing.

Donald Trump: Thank you very much. Thank you.

Aide: Thanks, press. Let's go. Let's go. Thank you, press.
