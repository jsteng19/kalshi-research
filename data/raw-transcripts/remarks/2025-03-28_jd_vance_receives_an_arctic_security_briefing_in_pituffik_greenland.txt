JD Vance: Hey, everybody. At ease, please. Thank you all. Good to see everybody. Let's have a -- let's have a seat and have a briefing and learn exactly what you do here, Colonel. I will say that the Colonel was kind enough to lend me her office for a few minutes so I can get my bearings, and I'm going to -- I'm going to embarrass the Colonel.

Unidentified: Oh, no. [Laughter]

JD Vance: So, it turns out that Colonel Myers here did the polar bear plunge and got a certificate that the temperature never reached above 41 degrees. And let it be known that this task of questionable sanity was accomplished despite near freezing temperatures, the threat of collapsing icebergs, and lusty seals. So, I want to hear about these lusty seals in this briefing here.

Unidentified: [Laughter]

Unidentified: Yeah. So, every July we do a polar bear plunge where we actually jump into the ocean, go in a few feet, spend a couple seconds, and come out. Some of us do it twice or three times. And then you could also do it at the waterfall and a few other places, and for it, you get a certificate for your stupidity.

JD Vance: [Laughter]

Unidentified: So, to get the certificate, how long do you have to stay in?

JD Vance: You just have to go in --

Unidentified: You just have to go in.

JD Vance: You have to go -- you have to go all the way.

Unidentified: You have to go all in.

JD Vance: All in.

Unidentified: OK.

JD Vance: Yeah.

Unidentified: Man, you guys are tough up there.

JD Vance: It's awesome.

JD Vance: Alright. Thank you, reporters. Get out of here so we can talk about this stuff.
