Unidentified: The Vice President of the United States and the second Lady Miss Usha to the Global gateway. Sir, as I -- as I told you before, you got on the mighty C-130 that our mission here is to project power and to create community. Sir, you saw one of our platforms across the multitude of what we do to project power here.

Unidentified: But something that's very dear to my heart is creating community, and I understand you're here to toast our awesome airmen and guardians. Hello. And so, sir, in honor of that, we have a 86th Airlift Wing mug for you.

JD Vance: Fantastic.

Unidentified: And then we also are ready for you to serve some beer if you'd like.

JD Vance: OK. Thank you. Well, thank you, general. Thank you, guys, the entire team. I just want to say a few things. First of all, we're so proud of you, and we're so grateful for what you do. I see some families here. We know that military service, especially at the level that you guys do it, is an incredible sacrifice not just for all of you but for the whole team.

JD Vance: So, we're grateful to you. We just got back, as you may know, from a trip. We went to Italy. We went to India, and now we're back again. So, I have no idea what the hell day it is, what time it is, but we're proud to be here celebrating with you guys. And as the general said, we know that you guys are one of the most important parts of how we project power overseas.

JD Vance: We refuel our missions. We deliver cargo. We deliver weapons if we have to. We deliver humanitarian assistance to the people who need it. So, I'm just so grateful to you guys for what you do. And as a -- as an Iraq War veteran myself, I know this is a place that a lot of wounded warriors came before they came home.

JD Vance: So, whether you're getting cargo to where it needs to go or taking care of our troops who've gone off to war, we are grateful to you guys. We're thankful for what you do. And I guess as a small token of appreciation, I'm going to serve you some beers. Thank you all. God bless you. Thanks for having me.

JD Vance: Alright, so -- I've got -- I've got a great -- is this a stein? Is that what this thing is called? OK. Well, we are in Germany here, and I would chug -- you guys want some beer? No. That would go viral and not in a good way my friends. All right. But here, let me -- so what kind of beer we got here? Is this a good German beer?

Unidentified: Yes.

JD Vance: Yes? OK. All right, here we go. All right. All right, to the airmen of this base, the airwomen of this base, and all of our troops serving overseas, God bless you guys. Cheers.

Unidentified: Cheers.

JD Vance: Great. Thank you all. Now, I think if you don't have a beer, I'm happy to serve one. Is it the red tap I guess that's on. We'll see how my my -- my pouring abilities are here. But come on, guys. Get a drink and say hello. Thank you all.
