Donald Trump: Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. I just wanted to say, we love you, you are special. We're here to take care of you. It's going well. And I want to thank you for coming out. We're going to get you back and operating immediately. Thank you, everybody. What a crowd. What a turnout.

Donald Trump: I want to thank our governor. Your governor has done a fantastic job. Governor Abbott, thank you very much. He's right here, someplace. He's right here. So we just want to thank your governor, and Senator Cruz, Senator Cornyn -- everybody. We want to thank the whole group. This has been a total cooperative effort.

Donald Trump: Again, we will see you soon. I will tell you, this is historic, it's epic, what happened. But you know what, it happened in Texas, and Texas can handle anything. Thank you all, folks. Thank you. [Applause] Thank you.
