Donald Trump: On behalf of Melania, myself and the entire Trump family, I want to wish everyone a wonderful Thanksgiving. From the very beginning of our nation, Americans have come together to remember our blessings, and give thanks to God.

Donald Trump: This Thanksgiving, we remember more than 200,000 brave Americans who are currently serving overseas. We thank God for every patriot who serves our nation in uniform.

Donald Trump: We also pause to pray for all of those who have suffered loss this year, especially survivors and families of the innocent Americans who were victims of the horrific and hateful acts of violence, and we pray for everyone affected by catastrophic storms and devastating wildfires that have ravaged communities in California.

Donald Trump: Every American heart is with those impacted by these terrible tragedies. We thank every firefighter, first responder, and law enforcement officer, who raced into danger to save so many lives. These are brave people. These are great people. These are special people.

Donald Trump: Our spirits are lifted as we witness Americans across the country rescue those who are in danger, support those who are in need, and come together to rebuild homes and restore hope.

Donald Trump: This Thanksgiving, we express our profound gratitude to the family and friends who enriched our lives, to the neighbors who strengthen our communities, and to our fellow citizens who make this glorious nation into a beautiful home.

Donald Trump: We are all thankful for the incredible prosperity booming all across our land. We thank God for the blessing of being American, the joy of spending time with loved ones, and the sacrifices made by the heroes who keep America safe, strong, and free. Thank you. God bless you, and Happy Thanksgiving to everyone.
