Donald Trump: Well, thank you very much, and I just want to congratulate everybody. The stock market -- Dow Jones Industrial Average -- just hit 30,000, which is the highest in history. We've never broken 30,000, and that's just -- despite everything that's taken place with the pandemic.

Donald Trump: I'm very, uh, thrilled with what's happened on the vaccine front. That's been absolutely incredible. It's -- nothing like that has ever happened medically, and I think people are acknowledging that, and it's having a big effect.

Donald Trump: But the stock market's just broken 30,000 -- never been broken, that number. That's a sacred number, 30,000. Nobody thought they'd ever see it. That's the 9th time since the beginning of 2020, and it's the 48th time that we've broken records in -- during the Trump administration.

Donald Trump: And I just want to congratulate all the people within the administration that worked so hard, and most importantly, I want to congratulate the people of our country, because there are no people like you. Thank you very much everybody. Thank you.
