Note: [The campaign of Brad Schimel advertised a telerally with Donald Trump to be held on March 27, 2025. Per media reports, the telerally was held, but a recording was not made available after the event.]

Note: [Similar telerallies for candidates were subsequently released in full by the campaign. The Schimel campaign did not respond to email and social media messages requesting a copy of the recording or for the recording to be released publicly.]
