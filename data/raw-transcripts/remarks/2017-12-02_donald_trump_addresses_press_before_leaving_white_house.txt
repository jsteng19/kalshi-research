Donald Trump: Well, it was a fantastic evening last night. We passed the largest tax cuts in the history of our country, and many other things along with it. Tremendous tax reform, but it was the biggest package in terms of tax cuts ever passed in our country.

Donald Trump: Now we go on to conference and something beautiful is going to come out of that picture. People are gonna be very, very happy. They're gonna get tremendous, tremendous tax cuts and tax relief, and that's what this country needs. One other thing: business tax, all the way down from 35 to 20. It could 22 when it comes out, it could also be 20, we're gonna see what ultimately comes out.

Donald Trump: But we now go into what I call the mixer, and the mixer is conference. And out of that, the House Republicans and the Senate Republicans, are going to pick something that will be truly spectacular.

Donald Trump: In addition, though, we have other things that we approved last night, which really make it some package. So these are the biggest tax cuts in the history of our country.
