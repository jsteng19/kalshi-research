Note: [Donald Trump was greeted by King Willem-Alexander, Queen Máxima and Catharina-Amalia, Princess of Orange of the Netherlands at the Huis ten Bosch Palace in The Hague on June 24, 2025.]

Note: [The video of the greeting -- 74 seconds long, was released by the White House without audio. Using experimental ✧AI technology at Roll Call Factba.se, we were able to lip-read some of the exchange. Please note this is experimental and should be treated as an educated inference / a good faith attempt to discern what was said, and is no way meant to be verbatim.]

Note: [Based on the ✧AI technology, the four exchanged pleasantries and greeetings. The King stating he was glad Trump was there and thanking Trump for joining them. Trump thanked them and commented that it was a nice day, and delivered a brief "he said to me" anecdote and commented that -- something -- was beautiful and asked if the king thought it was beautiful.]
