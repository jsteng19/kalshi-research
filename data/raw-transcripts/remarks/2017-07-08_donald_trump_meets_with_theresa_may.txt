Theresa May: Can I say it's great to have an opportunity, Mr. President, to talk with you again, and to continue to build on a special relationship we have in with the United States.

Donald Trump: Yes, thank you.

Theresa May: Looking forward to doing that, particularly, obviously in the area of trade, as... and our talks beginning very positively in that area. But there's a lot of other big international issues for us to talk about today.

Donald Trump: That's right, that's right.

Theresa May: On counterterrorism, on tensions in the Middle East. I think a great deal that we can work on together.

Donald Trump: Well, we had a great group of people together, and really done a fantastic job together. I'd like to thank Prime Minister May for being with us. We've had tremendous talks. There is no country that could possibly be closer than our countries. And I just want to say thank you very much.

Donald Trump: We are working on a trade deal -- a very, very big deal, a very powerful deal. Great for both countries. And I think we'll have that done very, very quickly. We have all of our trade people. We have Wilbur Ross with us. We have all of the trade people.

Donald Trump: Rex and I had a tremendous meeting yesterday with President Putin, and we've had really great meetings with a lot of people. We're having a lot today. But Prime Minister May and I have developed a very special relationship, and I think trade will be a very big factor between our two countries. I want to thank you very much.
