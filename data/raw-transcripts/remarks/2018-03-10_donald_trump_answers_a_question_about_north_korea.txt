Question: Why now for North Korea, sir?

Donald Trump: I think North Korea is going to go very well, I think we will have tremendous success. I think this is going to be something very successful. We have a lot of support. So I think North Korea is going to go very well.

Donald Trump: The promise is they wouldn't be shooting off missiles in the meantime, and they're looking to de-nuke. So that'd be great.
