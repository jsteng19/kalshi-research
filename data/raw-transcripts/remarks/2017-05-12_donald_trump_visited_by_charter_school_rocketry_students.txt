Donald Trump: So I want to welcome... this is so great. Oh, I love you too. Come here [Laughter]. Thank you. He's a scientist. So I want to welcome the incredible students from Victory Christian Center School in Charlotte, North Carolina. What a state. Great city, great state. You like it in North Carolina? [Crosstalk]

Donald Trump: These students competed against 810 teams in preliminary stages to advance to the National Team America rocketry challenge, the world's largest student model rocket contest.

Donald Trump: And they did fantastically well, and you're down to about a hundred now, and guess what the name of the rocket is? It's called Trump. [Laughter]. It better work well. And to qualify the Trump needed to soar to an altitude of 775 feet with a flight duration of 41 to 43 seconds. How long did it stay up? How long? How long was the duration?

Teacher: [Inaudible]

Donald Trump: That's good, that's good. And return without breaking so much as an eggshell -- that means that it had to land soft, right? And the Trump will compete tomorrow against 100 other teams in Northern Virginia. So I just want to congratulate you, that's a fantastic achievement, really? You all want to be scientists or something? [Crosstalk, Laughter]

Donald Trump: I also might add they were sponsored by the Aerospace Industries Association and the National Association of Rocketry, and that's a great group of people, and they spend a lot of money on a lot of good things, so you have to be very happy. But that looks like a mean machine you did like there, so I want to wish you a lot of luck. Anybody... how did you come up with the name Trump, does anybody have an idea?

Student: Simply because it conquers all. [Laughter]

Donald Trump: Okay, They're never gonna put that on television. [Laughter] That's really nice. well I wish you a lot of luck. I'll be watching, and do the best, and I'll make you a deal, if you win come, on back and we'll celebrate, okay? [Applause] Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you.
