Donald Trump: Thank you very much. It's a great honor and privilege -- because he's become a friend of mine -- to introduce President Erdogan of Turkey. He's running a very difficult part of the world. He's involved very, very strongly and, frankly, he's getting very high marks. And he's also been working with the United States.

Donald Trump: We have a great friendship as countries. I think we're, right now, as close as we have ever been. And a lot of that has to do with the personal relationship. So, President, thank you very much. It's a great honor to have you in the United States. Thank you.

Recep Tayyip Erdogan: [Via Interpreter] Thank you so much, Mr. President. We are here in New York, in the United States, to attend the General Assembly of the United Nations.

Recep Tayyip Erdogan: And I would like to once again thank you for this opportunity, and it's great to get together with you.

Donald Trump: Well, thank you very much, Mr. President. We appreciate it. Thank you all very much.
