Donald Trump: Thank you much. We appreciate it. President Putin and I have been discussing various things, and I think it's going very well. We've had some very, very good talks.

Donald Trump: We're gonna have a talk now, and obviously that will continue. But we look forward to a lot of very positive things happening, for Russia, for the United States, and for everybody concerned. And it's an honor to be with you. Thank you. Thank you.

Vladimir Putin: [Via Translator] Your excellency, Mr. President, we spoke over the phone with you several times on very important bilateral and international issues. But phone conversation is never enough definitely.

Vladimir Putin: [Via Translator] But if we want to have important bilaterals and be able to resolve most acute international topics and issues, definitely we'll need a personal meeting. And I'm delighted to be able to meet you personally Mr. President, and I hope, as you have said, our meeting will yield positive results. [Inaudible]

Vladimir Putin: [In English] Thank you
