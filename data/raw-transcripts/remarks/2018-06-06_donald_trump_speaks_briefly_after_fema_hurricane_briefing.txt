Donald Trump: Well, thank you very much, everybody. We just went through a briefing, and it's very impressive, what's taken place in the last short period of time. We've never had a season like we had last season. And what we went through is incredible. And without you we couldn't have done it. We know how hard you work.

Donald Trump: And Brock and Secretary Nielsen, we really appreciate it. We're with our great First Lady and our great Vice President.

Donald Trump: I want to just say we very much respect the work you've done. And the fact that you do it so well, so seamlessly. We had a season last year like no other, in terms of the power, the level, the hurricanes, the fires along the West Coast. We just really appreciate what you've been able to do.

Donald Trump: Whether it's in Texas or in Florida, in Puerto Rico. You're going to Louisiana, you're going to Alabama, you're going to places that really have not been hit like this. You can be very, very proud of yourselves. And I'm very proud to be with you.

Donald Trump: And speaking for Melania and Mike, we thank you all very much. Great job. Great job. Thank you. [Applause]
