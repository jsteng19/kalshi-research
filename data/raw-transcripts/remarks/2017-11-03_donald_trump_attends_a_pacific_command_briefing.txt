Donald Trump: Well, thank you very much. So many familiar faces, admiral, from the media. They're lovely people. Good relationships. But I'll tell you, this is very special to be in Hawaii, and to be visiting, very shortly, Pearl Harbor, which I've read about, spoken about, heard about, studied, but I haven't seen.

Donald Trump: And that's going to be very exciting for me and my wife. So thank you very much. It's really incredible. It's been wonderful meeting the folks that you're with, and that's a lot of talent. A lot of tough people, and a lot of talented people and we appreciate it.

Harry Harris: It's great... it's great to have you here in Hawaii. Great to have you visit Pearl Harbor. We're all honored to have you on the island.

Donald Trump: Thank you.

Harry Harris: The people here on the island are grateful that you are here.

Donald Trump: Thank you. Appreciate it.
