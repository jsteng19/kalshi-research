Donald Trump: [In Progress] -- the President of France, who's doing a terrific job being President of France. He's changing a lot of things around. And I guess that had to happen. And I think it's going to be very successful. We have a tremendous relationship.

Donald Trump: We're discussing trade. We're discussing NATO. We're discussing a lot of different things. And hopefully, in the end, it will all work out. And so it's great to be with you.

Emmanuel Macron: [In French, Translation via Google Translate] Thank you very much. I am very happy to meet with President Trump. Almost a year ago now, it was in Paris, to attend our national holiday with his delegation. Since then, we speak regularly and we still do. Obviously, the commercial topics,as he also said, were discussed.

Donald Trump: It sounded beautifully. [Laughter] I have no idea -- it sounded great.

Emmanuel Macron: I told them exactly the same -- [Laughter] -- but in French, for French journalists. [Inaudible] I just reminded everybody that almost one year ago you were present with your wife in Paris for Bastille Day.

Donald Trump: Beautiful.

Emmanuel Macron: [Inaudible] 14th of July. And we've worked together for 12 months now.

Donald Trump: True.

Emmanuel Macron: And took some great decisions.

Donald Trump: We've made some good decisions.

Emmanuel Macron: And we'll continue to work together [Inaudible].

Donald Trump: That's right. Thank you very much. Thank you.

Question: President Macron, do you agree that Angela Merkel is beholden to the Russians?

Donald Trump: Oh, I believe they asked you that. [Laughter] Thank you. Thank you very much.

Emmanuel Macron: No, I think --

Question: No?

Emmanuel Macron: We just discussed the nature of that. We work together.
