Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani: And we count on you and your leadership as well to end this war and to help the people of Gaza, the situation is very, very, very bad there. So we are here to meet and to do everything we can to stop this war and to bring the hostages back. So once again, Mr. President, thank you very much for hosting everybody.

Donald Trump: Well, and also a great speech you made today. Really, I watched it, a really great speech. Thank you very much. And you too, my friend, great speech. You did a great job, pounding on that table. They said, how would you like to deal with him all your life? It's not easy.

Donald Trump: You did a great job. Thank you very much. Thank you, everybody. We're going to work very hard on this. This is going to be -- this is my most important meeting.

Donald Trump: I've had important meetings. I don't want to insult anybody that we've met with, and we met with because I had 32 meetings here, but this is the one that's very important to me because we're going to end something that should have probably never started. Thank you very much, everybody. We appreciate it. Thank you.
