Note: [Pool coverage had short clips of Trump speaking and answering questions. This assembles them, as available, unedited.]

Question: Mr. President, your reaction to the Easter massacre in Sri Lanka, please?

Donald Trump: It's a terrible, terrible thing. Unthinkable. We've been fighting it for a long time, a lot of people have, a lot of people don't want to talk about it. It's a terrible thing. I just spoke with the Prime Minister. I spoke with the various government officials and we are working with Sri Lanka. But that's a terrible thing. Thank you.

Question: Are you worried that your staff is ignoring your orders as the Mueller Report portrays?

Donald Trump: Nobody disobeys my orders.

Question: Are you worried about impeachment, Mr. President?

Donald Trump: Not even a little bit. [End of first clip.]

Donald Trump: I will. Oh It's happening. It's being built now. Here's a young guy who said 'Keep building that wall. Can you believe it?' He's going to be a conservative some day, huh?

Donald Trump: You gonna say hello to your dad? Whose is this? So is everything good? Everything good? You got that one, right?

Unidentified: [Laughter]

Donald Trump: Thank you kids. Have a good time. Do well in school. Work hard. [Inaudible]  alright? Who would want to be? [Inaudible] Have a good time everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much.
