Donald Trump: Thank you very much. We've all had a very successful day and a very interesting day. It's great to be with my friend, the President of Mexico. And we're negotiating NAFTA and some other things with Mexico, and we'll see how it all turns out. But I think we've made very good progress. So, it's great to be with you. Thank you.

Enrique Peña Nieto: [Via Translator] Thank you very much. I want to thank you for opening this space that I have with President Donald Trump. I have truly hope that will help us continue a very flowing dialogue that will allow us, of course, for the negotiation of NAFTA; to continue working in terms of cooperation, especially for security, for the security of both nations, especially in our borders.

Enrique Peña Nieto: And, of course, also working on migration issues, which is a task that both of our nations are occupied, and our administrations are occupied with this issue as well. And, of course, something that both of our administrations have taken upon ourselves to really admit, that is in a co-responsible manner to look into organized crime issues. Thank you so much for this space of opportunity.

Donald Trump: Thank you. Thank you very much.

Reporter: Mr. President, do you still want Mexico to pay for the wall?

Donald Trump: Absolutely.
