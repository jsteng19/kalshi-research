JD Vance: Great. Well, hello, everybody. Um, we're happy to host, uh, the UK delegation, uh, led of course by Foreign Secretary David Lammy, who I've known for a little while here. And obviously we have a lot in common. The special relationship between the United Kingdom and the United States will remain very strong.

JD Vance: Uh, we're going to talk about something that -- that he and I spoke about a couple of years ago when we met, which is our shared belief that Europe really should take a bigger role in its own security. And I'm glad the Foreign Secretary agrees with me on that. I think there are a lot of other issues of common agreement.

JD Vance: I'm sure we'll talk about Russia, Ukraine, as well, but Mr. Foreign Secretary, it's good to see you. Welcome. Thank you.

David Lammy: Very good to see you. The special relationship, the Anglo-American relationship, is more than just an alliance. It's a covenant.

JD Vance: That's right.

David Lammy: Between two partners. And we're very pleased to be your partner across the sea. Last year, we met with both in opposition. We were talking about growth in our economies. We were talking about the problems we've got with controlling our borders. And, of course, we were talking about European security.

David Lammy: Uh, we're committed to increasing defense and encourage our friends across Europe to do the same. And, of course, we've got important issues to discuss on Ukraine and how we support Ukraine in this tough moment, um, and also broader issues, uh, of UK-US security.

JD Vance: Wonderful. Well, we're looking forward to it. Thank you, all. Good to see you.

Question: Do you think Russia should rejoin the G7?

JD Vance: Take care, guys.

Question: Thank you. Will you talk about Gaza? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, everyone. Thank you.
