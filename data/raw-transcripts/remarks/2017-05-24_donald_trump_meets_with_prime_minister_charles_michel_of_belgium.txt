Charles Michel: Mr. President, a pleasure to meet you. I want to welcome you in Brussels, and we are very pleased to have this occasion to discuss with you. We are facing many very sensitive and important challenges, and the ties between between your country and our country are also very important, and thank you for your presence. Thank you for this occasion to discuss together. Thank you.

Donald Trump: Well, thank you very much. It's an honor to be with you, and my whole group, we've been looking forward to this trip. mMeting the king was wonderful, and we had a great discussion, and we will work together on various problems. Number one right now is terrorism, and we are fighting very hard, doing very well under our generals, and making tremendous progress. But when you see something like happened two days ago, you realize how important it is to win this fight, and we will win this fight. It's a horrible situation. What took place is horrible, unthinkable. But we will win 100%.

Charles Michel: Thank you.

Donald Trump: Thank you. Thank you.

Unidentified: Thank you. Thank you very much.
