Donald Trump: [Off-mic] Get it?

Unidentified: Yes, sir. [Inaudible]. Thank you very much. [Inaudible]

Elon Musk: So, you can see some of the Starship vehicles that are -- you see [Inaudible] things.

Unidentified: Yeah. Yeah.

Elon Musk: OK. The head of the factory. And then those [Inaudible] are actually hollow inside, and they're [Inaudible]

Unidentified: Awesome.

Elon Musk: Yeah, it looks awesome. Inside there, it's like -- looks like a science fiction movie.

Unidentified: I [Inaudible] extraordinary because [Inaudible]

Elon Musk: Yeah. When you see this compared to -- the Falcon [Inaudible] small --

Unidentified: Yes.

Elon Musk: Actually the Falcon is not as small [Inaudible]

Unidentified: No, no.

Donald Trump: By comparison.

Elon Musk: By comparison. It's a [Inaudible]

Donald Trump: [Inaudible] a lot. Right there.

Unidentified: [Inaudible]

Elon Musk: So, if you can [Inaudible] you can see a tower that -- you can see sort of -- it looks like smoke, but that's actually gaseous oxygen. So, that's -- that's the [Inaudible]

Donald Trump: Yeah.

Elon Musk: [Inaudible] comes back, catches [Inaudible]

Donald Trump: [Inaudible] When does it come back? How long?

Elon Musk: Five minutes. Five minutes. [Inaudible] Roughly five or six minutes after launch, it'll come back in.

Donald Trump: Oh [Inaudible]

Elon Musk: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Oh, love that.

Elon Musk: Yeah.

Donald Trump: I thought it'd be like in a day.

Elon Musk: Yeah.

Donald Trump: [Inaudible]

Elon Musk: No.

Donald Trump: [Inaudible]

Elon Musk: Yeah.

Donald Trump: So, it's up [Inaudible]

Elon Musk: The booster, actually, [Inaudible] this propellants and [Inaudible]. It's 7,500 tons of thrust roughly. At 5,000 tons [Inaudible]. It's 10 times the weight of a -- if you take the biggest 747 fully loaded, it's 10 times the weight of a -- the maximum weight of a 747.

Donald Trump: Wow.

Elon Musk: So like [Inaudible] 10 fully loaded 747s, that's the weight.

Donald Trump: So, what's the closest you figure that [Inaudible]

Elon Musk: Yes, we do actually [Inaudible] that has like -- like [Inaudible] gas.

Donald Trump: That's right. That's right.

Elon Musk: But I would say this is about as close [Inaudible]

Donald Trump: [Inaudible]. Hello. How are you?

Donald Trump, Jr.: [Inaudible]

Elon Musk: That [Inaudible]

Donald Trump: [Inaudible]

Elon Musk: That's the Starship [Inaudible]. Yeah. So, we'll -- yeah.

Donald Trump: Does the wind effect [Inaudible]

Elon Musk: This is actually an OK level.

Donald Trump: It is? Good.

Elon Musk: And if you want to see -- these are some videos that kind of illustrate what [Inaudible] like.

Donald Trump: [Inaudible]

Elon Musk: Sorry, guys. Just [Inaudible] try to watch the video. This gives you a sense of, you know, what it's like.

Donald Trump: [Inaudible]

Elon Musk: This is [Inaudible] designed to -- to be a Mars colonizer. [Inaudible] planet colonizer rocket. It's a -- it's intended to be able to carry multiple [Inaudible] to Mars.

Donald Trump: [Inaudible] size much bigger [Inaudible]

Elon Musk: Well, we'll make bigger [Inaudible] or roughly 100 to 200 [Inaudible] going to be like [Inaudible]

Unidentified: 10,000ft. How long will it take to get to Mars?

Donald Trump: [Inaudible]

Unidentified: How long will it take to get to Mars?

Elon Musk: [Inaudible]. It's kind of like [Inaudible] to Australia from here. [Inaudible]

Donald Trump: [Inaudible]

Unidentified: Have you identified [Inaudible]

Elon Musk: Yeah. The -- this [Inaudible] but where there's a lot of water ice. So, [Inaudible]

Donald Trump: [Inaudible]

Elon Musk: [Inaudible] ice [Inaudible] there's no liquid water.

Donald Trump: No liquid water.

Elon Musk: [Inaudible] like a planet. You could -- you could [Inaudible] like a planet [Inaudible]. Well, there's the fast way and the slow way. Slow way [Inaudible]. Fast way would be with [Inaudible]

Donald Trump: [Inaudible]

Elon Musk: Yeah. Quite far [Inaudible] but that's -- that's what you want to get it done [Inaudible]

Donald Trump: [Inaudible]

Elon Musk: i mean, I'd say [Inaudible] why not? It's [Inaudible]

Ted Cruz: Well, if you [Inaudible]

Elon Musk: Yeah.

Unidentified: Elon, how long does it take [Inaudible] see form this direction [Inaudible]

Elon Musk: Well, this place -- everything you see, we built it from scratch. So [Inaudible]. So everything, we built. And we have basically nothing about five years [Inaudible]

Unidentified: Wow. [Inaudible]

Elon Musk: [Inaudible]

Unidentified: [Inaudible]

Donald Trump: [Inaudible]

Unidentified: [Inaudible]

Donald Trump: [Inaudible]

Elon Musk: It looks crazy.

Unidentified: [Inaudible]

Elon Musk: Yeah.

Unidentified: [Inaudible]

Donald Trump: This [Inaudible]

Elon Musk: Yeah.

Donald Trump: Because they're still counting votes in [Inaudible]

Elon Musk: Seriously.

Donald Trump: You know what? They're counting votes still in Pennsylvania.

Elon Musk: That's pretty absurd. That's kind of what the inside of the factory looks like.

Donald Trump: [Inaudible] you see that [Inaudible]

Donald Trump, Jr.: [Inaudible]

Elon Musk: I think you'd actually go [Inaudible]. I'm going from the [Inaudible].

Donald Trump: Wow.

Elon Musk: Mars' gravity is only 40% that of Earth, so it's much easier to like -- dramatically easier. [Inaudible]

Donald Trump: Well, that's [Inaudible]

Unidentified: [Inaudible] see the tower to get [Inaudible]

Elon Musk: Yeah.

Unidentified: You've been [Inaudible]

Donald Trump: You can save that for Mars.

Elon Musk: At some point. At some point [Inaudible]

Unidentified: [Inaudible]

Elon Musk: That would be a risky move.

Unidentified: I think we want his mind here. Yeah, no. We can't -- we can't let -- we can't let him go.

Donald Trump, Jr.: Let's just leave that here.

Donald Trump: Showing the public [Inaudible]. Whoops.

Elon Musk: So, this is -- so, the left is what is the simulation, and the right is reality. Can you see how close the simulation versus the reality is? [Inaudible] see the right side.

Donald Trump: [Inaudible]. Oh, good. Nobody could [Inaudible]. Is that [Inaudible]

Elon Musk: Yeah.

Donald Trump: [Inaudible]

Elon Musk: But I know [Inaudible] this is crazy. It is kind of of crazy. [Inaudible]

Donald Trump: [Inaudible]

Elon Musk: Yes. [Inaudible] so we might -- we might sort of [Inaudible]

Donald Trump: [Inaudible]. What's the time [Inaudible]

Elon Musk: About 45 minutes.

Donald Trump: [Inaudible]

Elon Musk: [Inaudible]

Unidentified: He's the last one. Blue dress. Am I going? I don't know [Inaudible] We're going to do one video camera, and then we'll have you guys come in one second. Did he point to me? Yes.

Donald Trump: [Inaudible]. Steve, come.

Unidentified: Mr. Witkoff.

Donald Trump: He's our envoy to the Middle East [Inaudible]

Unidentified: Hey, Mr. [Inaudible]. How are you, sir? Good to see you. How are you? Good. Good. [Inaudible] Oh, yeah. It's tight.

Elon Musk: [Inaudible] You try to use the atmosphere, right, as much as possible. So, you're kind of going like this. So, this is [Inaudible] if a porous [Inaudible]

Donald Trump: Right.

Elon Musk: It's [Inaudible] like this. It's literally trying to use its entire body as the brake, and that's using these flaps to control its position, try to achieve a [Inaudible] 70 degree angle [Inaudible]. Then when it goes subsonic --

Donald Trump: Is that controlled by a computer or by a man?

Elon Musk: [Inaudible]

Donald Trump: Right.

Elon Musk: [Inaudible] So -- and when it goes subsonic, it actually starts to go [Inaudible]. It's falling -- it's falling down like this. So, it's just -- it's like a skydiver. So, just think of these -- these flaps like the skydiver's arms and legs. So, it's falling down like this. And then, right at the end of its run, [Inaudible]

Unidentified: How high [Inaudible]

Elon Musk: Like [Inaudible] this.

Unidentified: What's this [Inaudible]

Elon Musk: It's [Inaudible] high.

Unidentified: [Inaudible] on the surface.

Elon Musk: So, if you see -- you see that first black cloud? [Inaudible] leeward side of the rocket. So, the other side, the windward side of this glass house [Inaudible]

Donald Trump: [Inaudible]

Donald Trump, Jr.: [Inaudible]. It didn't seem like there [Inaudible]

Donald Trump: [Inaudible]

Donald Trump, Jr.: Yeah. That's what [Inaudible]

Donald Trump: [Inaudible]. Yeah. [Inaudible]

Donald Trump, Jr.: [Inaudible]

Donald Trump: [Off-mic]

Donald Trump, Jr.: [Off-mic]

Donald Trump: OK? A pretty good job, huh? [Inaudible], you OK? Everything good? [Inaudible]. Are you OK, [Inaudible]? Good? [Inaudible] [Off-mic]

Unidentified: [Off-mic]

Donald Trump: [Off-mic]

Donald Trump, Jr.: [Off-mic]

Unidentified: [Off-mic]

Donald Trump, Jr.: We're not the same.

Donald Trump: How's the [Inaudible]? Good?

Unidentified: It's good [Inaudible]

Donald Trump: [Inaudible]

Unidentified: [Inaudible]

Donald Trump: [Off-mic]

Donald Trump, Jr.: [Off-mic]

Unidentified: [Off-mic]

Donald Trump: Don't tell him.

Unidentified: I'm not. I know I'm not [Inaudible]

Donald Trump: [Inaudible]. So, here we go [Inaudible]

Unidentified: Flight director's go for launch. All right. We're now T-minus 20 seconds until liftoff of Starship Flight 6. This will mark our second attempt to catch the Super Heavy booster at the launch tower. [Inaudible] six, five, four, three, two, one. Four, three, two, one. [Inaudible] vehicle [Inaudible] down range.

Unidentified: [Inaudible] nominal.

Donald Trump: [Off-mic]

Unidentified: Coming up in just a little over a minute from now, it's going to be hot staging [Inaudible] on those ship ignite while still attached to the booster. Just before that, we'll see all the three center end rings on the booster shut down. And we call it MECO as most engines cut off [Inaudible] main engine.

Unidentified: So, while we continue to watch it go up, a lot of our flight controllers looking at all the systems are at the tower, yet we have to send a manual -- we're just about 30 seconds away from hot staging.

Donald Trump: [Off-mic]

Unidentified: And we heard -- we heard the tower is go for catch. All right, hot staging confirmed. Six out of six lit on the ship. Booster boostback going. We heard that we are go for [Inaudible]. Kate [Inaudible]. Hopefully, we got a booster coming home real soon. From our view here, Dan, great views of planet Earth behind that Super Heavy booster.

Unidentified: Right now, it is performing [Inaudible] good news. They're telling us that the -- the pressures inside the ship are good. That is the second stage or the upper portion of the vehicle, follow along the telemetry on the bottom of your screen. Yeah, booster is currently -- super heavy is currently in its boostback burn.

Unidentified: This boostback burn lasts just a little bit over a minute. So, we've got a little -- approximately 30 seconds left.

Donald Trump: [Off-mic]

Unidentified: [Inaudible] hand side of your screen then tracking cam there on the right of your screen. You see those [Inaudible] [Inaudible] So, you can see that the hot stage has been jettisoned. Has visual confirmation of that there on your screen, which is great. Now, the next -- Starship is following the nominal trajectory.

Unidentified: The next step for booster is going into that landing burn. Again, it will light up 13 of those engines and then tear down into three engines right before booster [Inaudible] Just real quick. We did hear the [Inaudible] left boostback [Inaudible] steer offshore divert. Unfortunately, that means we are no go for the catch.

Unidentified: As we said before, we'll have tower and the vehicle, as well as the operators [Inaudible] have been actively evaluating the criteria for that return to the watch tower. And, unfortunately, we did not have a pass on those specific criteria [Inaudible] tower catch. And we did mention that we were constantly evaluating the criteria for catch.

Unidentified: There's a lot of things that need to go well in order to line that up. Unfortunately, today, we're going to forego our booster catch of the day. But what you're seeing on your screen is the ship currently making its way towards the Indian Ocean, still looking good so far. Exactly. The views there of the booster on the left-hand side of your screen, views of the ship on the right-hand side of your screen.

Unidentified: Now, we said before that it was not guaranteed that we would be able to make a tower catch today. So, while we were hoping for it, like we said, it was pretty epic on [Inaudible] but the safety of the teams and the public and -- and the pad itself are paramount. [Inaudible] in any of those [Inaudible] Exactly.

Unidentified: We're still trying to get a lot of good flight data with [Inaudible] have an additional objective today to do an in-space relight of our Raptor engine to [Inaudible] help us set us up for being able to do [Inaudible] Super Heavy [Inaudible] kicking its way back down to Earth. Once again, we are attempting an offshore landing of the Super Heavy booster.

Unidentified: So, we have seen this before, and it is still very fun to watch [Inaudible] come down for a soft splashdown [Inaudible]. So, you can see it there reentering. So, earlier [Inaudible] grid fins [Inaudible]

Donald Trump: [Off-mic]

Unidentified: [Off-mic] [Inaudible] again. So, we'd like to confirm a water landing once again for the Super Heavy booster. Congrats to the SpaceX team for making that [Inaudible] continues to look [Inaudible]

Elon Musk: [Off-mic]

Donald Trump: Now, you need to get it [Inaudible]

Elon Musk: [Inaudible] right over [Inaudible] at the touch [Inaudible] we can prove it with every successful [Inaudible] by a thousand little things. The specific next one we have is a lot of small improvements. There's a big version of increase with the -- that'll -- that'll be flying next year. That's got the Version 3 of our engines.

Elon Musk: That'll look very different. That will be longer and have a lot more thrust and have the [Inaudible] next generation versions. So -- but you can see on those screens up there, that's the ship that is now going around the Earth. So, if you want to maybe get a better view if you come --

Donald Trump: Oh.

Unidentified: It has been a very exciting afternoon so far. We'd like to send it back over to Dan, who can give us that live view experience. Dan, once again, are you OK after witnessing another Starship launch? Yeah. Totally --

Elon Musk: So, this is going around the Earth. [Inaudible] 26,000 kilometers an hour. I'd say about 16,000 or 17,000 miles an hour.

Donald Trump: It's going to land [Inaudible]

Elon Musk: It's about 600 miles northwest of Australia.

Donald Trump: Incredible.

Elon Musk: So, it's actually going through the dark side of -- like Earth is -- the region of Earth that it's going through is now dark. It'll enter -- the return -- where it's actually sunny. So, it's currently sunny about 600 miles northwest of Australia. So, it'll go out of Earth's shadow, and we should be able to see it land, and that'll be pretty cool.

Unidentified: [Inaudible]

Elon Musk: It's going to land in the water.

Unidentified: OK.

Elon Musk: The -- once it gets to reenter, it's pretty wild because [Inaudible] stay close like super hot. I mean, it looks like special effects because it's like every color -- it's like purple, red, white. It's wild.

Donald Trump: [Inaudible]

Elon Musk: There's some chance of it if it [Inaudible]

Donald Trump: [Inaudible]

Elon Musk: If it doesn't blow up [Inaudible]. It's going to be pretty toasty with [Inaudible]

Unidentified: How are the jest [Inaudible]

Elon Musk: If it doesn't blow up, we do have ships to try and bring it back. And then we can expect it to learn more.

Unidentified: But this one won't be reused?

Elon Musk: This will not be reused. So, this one is all about just learning. It's about learning more. So, we're going to actually -- this time, we're going to enter at a steeper angle than before. So, it's going to be a higher heating. And -- yeah. And we'll see if some of the changes we've made to the heat shield are better.

Elon Musk: In the last launch, you can actually see where it's getting really hot [Inaudible] some heat shields and there's like kind of glowing and little bits of melting -- all that kind of thing. So, this time, the heat shield could more robust. We also reduced the amount of heat shielding, so there's about six feet less heat shielding on the sides. We don't think that's necessary.

Unidentified: We are going to continue. The mission is not done.

Donald Trump, Jr.: [Off-mic]

Elon Musk: [Inaudible] so they -- there's a steel side and then the tile has [Inaudible] snap the tile onto the steel just so it doesn't have to worry about [Inaudible].

Unidentified: [Off-mic]

Elon Musk: [Inaudible] attached to the tower. We'll put them back on the booster. [Inaudible]

Unidentified: [Off-mic]

Donald Trump: Let's go.

Elon Musk: Yeah. Let's check it out.

Unidentified: They're still working.

Elon Musk: It's going to work [Inaudible]

Unidentified: Can I get a photo? Oh, yeah. [Inaudible]

Elon Musk: [Inaudible]

Unidentified: [Inaudible]

Elon Musk: OK.

Unidentified: OK. [Inaudible] about 10 times as [Inaudible] Yeah. [Inaudible]

Elon Musk: Yeah. So like [Inaudible]

Donald Trump: [Inaudible]

Elon Musk: That'll be the fastest way to get [Inaudible]. One thing this might actually [Inaudible]

Unidentified: [Inaudible] space monkey?

Elon Musk: Oh, OK. [Inaudible] spice monkey [Inaudible]

Unidentified: I'm Sorry. [Inaudible]

Elon Musk: No, we don't -- no --

Unidentified: I'll volunteer.

Elon Musk: No. No space monkey [Inaudible] Is it --

Unidentified: [Inaudible] Yeah.

Elon Musk: We should go to give it [Inaudible] or --

Unidentified: They're going to tell me [Inaudible] We're going to get -- are you ready to go get --

Elon Musk: Go to the factory?

Unidentified: Yes, sir.

Elon Musk: All right. So, we can go look at the factory.

Donald Trump: Good. Good.

Elon Musk: And then come come back and see the [Inaudible]

Donald Trump: OK.

Elon Musk: [Inaudible] Yeah. It's like weird wearing a jacket in this weather, but I guess -- well before [Inaudible]

Unidentified: You've got a flight date. You've got to wear [Inaudible]

Elon Musk: Yeah.

Bryson DeChambeau: I'm Bryson.

Unidentified: Phil. I will ask but -- are we allowed to go with them to the factory or is that a no [Inaudible] [Inaudible] It's probably already tracked us, but Elon told the president that they're going over to the factory to do the tour and then he wants to bring him back here. OK. Did you know that? I just [Inaudible] OK. We'll stay here.

Unidentified: You heard that. [Crosstalk] Well, I heard him say they were going. I didn't know if they were [Inaudible] [Inaudible] come back here for some other landing thing. Whatever they want to do, we're going to stay here [Inaudible]. They're going to go to [Inaudible] [Inaudible] too much sensitivity with the [Inaudible] [Inaudible] do you want to go to a departure where Katrina can ask questions?

Unidentified: Yes, ma'am. Are we doing that now though or when they come back? You can ask questions if you'd like. I don't know. Here? Yeah, where they're standing. OK. Once he begins photos, we're going to -- we will head up to the top for departure. So, Katrina, if you want to ask questions, you can come stand right here.

Unidentified: [Inaudible] right here. Nope. It's up there where they're already lined up. The sun is harsh today. OK, go. USA! USA! USA!

Question: Mr. President, are you reconsidering the nomination of Matt Gaetz?

Donald Trump: No.

Question: How far are you willing to go to get him confirmed?

Unidentified: Thank you. Thanks again. I'm going to hold you guys right here. USA! USA! USA! I'm going to hold you guys right here. And, Brandon, we're just going to hold right here. OK. Am I allowed to throw any more questions at him? Or -- [Inaudible]

Donald Trump: [Off-mic]

Unidentified: Three, two, one. Thank you.

Donald Trump: Thank you. Thank you, fellas. [Inaudible]
