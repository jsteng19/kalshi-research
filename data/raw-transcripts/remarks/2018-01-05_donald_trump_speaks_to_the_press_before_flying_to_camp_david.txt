Donald Trump: Hi, everybody. I'm going over with the senators. We're going to Camp David. We have a lot of things to work on, a lot of things to accomplish. The stock market is up very, very big today. We've set new records, and I think they'll be continued to set.

Donald Trump: The tax cuts are really kicking in far beyond what anyone thought. Numerous companies have today come out and announced that they're going to make big payments to their employees -- something that nobody really had in mind. So we're very honored by it.

Donald Trump: But the market is good. The jobs reports were very good, and we think they're going to get really good over the next couple of months. So again, we're going to Camp David with a lot of the great Republican senators, and we're making America great again. Thank you. Thank you very much.
