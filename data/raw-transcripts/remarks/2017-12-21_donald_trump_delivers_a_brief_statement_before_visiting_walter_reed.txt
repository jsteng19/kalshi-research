Donald Trump: I just want say Merry Christmas to everybody. I'm heading over right now to Walter Reed Military Medical Center to say hello to some of the bravest people anywhere in the world. They're great people.

Donald Trump: I'll be coming back right after that. We'll be over there for a while, but we're just going to wish them a Merry Christmas, a Happy New Year, and we love those people. Thank you. Thank you very much.
