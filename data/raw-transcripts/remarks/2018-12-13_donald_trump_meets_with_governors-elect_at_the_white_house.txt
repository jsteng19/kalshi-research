Donald Trump: Well, thank you very much. We have invited the nation's -- our great nation's newly elected governors. And some really terrific people. They're going to do a wonderful job. All of them had great victories. Some had very, very outstanding victories, in terms of the percentage of victory, and even surprising.

Donald Trump: We have some real stars in the room. And they became stars because of the way they handled themselves. I could almost say -- I think I could pretty much say, Mike, most of them have become stars, if not all. Because you won. Winning is a wonderful thing. [Laughter] So I thought what I'd do is go around the room, and maybe you could just introduce yourself; say hello.

Donald Trump: We have some Cabinet members, too. You can quickly introduce yourself, because we've all seen you guys. But I'd love to -- maybe say a couple of words. And it's an honor to have you all. Kristi?

Question: Mr. President, quick question about Michael Flynn. Mr. President --

Question: Any update on [Inaudible] your next Chief of Staff?

Donald Trump: We're interviewing people now for Chief of Staff, yes.

Question: How long is the short list now?

Donald Trump: Five people. Really good ones. Terrific people. Mostly well known, but terrific people.

Question: Mr. President, quick question about Michael Flynn. As you know, Judge Emmet Sullivan has asked the Office of Special Counsel and the FBI for the documents related to the interview of Michael Flynn. Do you --

Donald Trump: That's great.

Question: -- do you believe that the FBI acted improperly in how they handled his interview?

Donald Trump: Well, the FBI said Michael Flynn -- a general and a great person -- they said he didn't lie. And Mueller said, "Well, maybe he did." And now they're all having a big dispute. So I think it's a great thing that the judge is looking into that situation. That's a -- that's an honor for a lot of terrific people.

Donald Trump: Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you.
