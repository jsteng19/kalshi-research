Donald Trump: Thank you, everybody. Thank you very much, everybody.

Question: Sir, what did you say to Kamala Harris this morning when you -- when you shook hands?

Donald Trump: Just very polite, very polite.

Question: Is it plans for Debate 2?

Donald Trump: It was a great -- we had a great debate. We had a great poll numbers on the debate, and we enjoyed it. I think -- I hope she enjoyed it, too, but I enjoyed it. And -- no, we're looking at it. But, you know, when you win, you don't really necessarily have to do it a second time. So, we'll see, but we had a -- I thought we had a great debate last night. Thank you very much, everybody.

Question: What would need to change for you to agree to a second debate. Would you want different rules? Would you want a different format?

Donald Trump: Well, you know, when you -- when you don't win, it's like a fighter. When a fighter has a bad fight, gets knocked out, or loses the fight, the first thing he says is, "We want a rematch." So, we won the debate according to every poll, every single poll. I think that -- are we going to do a rematch? I just don't know. But we'll think about it.

Question: Would you still do the one on NBC on September 25th? You'd proposed that. Are you still committed to that?

Donald Trump: Yeah. I would -- I would do NBC. I'd do Fox, too. I'd do Fox, too. But right now, we have to determine whether or not we even want to do. We had a great night last night. And you see, by the poll numbers, it was really fantastic. Thank you very much, everybody.

Question: Thank you. [Inaudible] yesterday, sir?
