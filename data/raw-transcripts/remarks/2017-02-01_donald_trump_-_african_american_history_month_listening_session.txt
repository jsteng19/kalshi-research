Donald Trump: Well, this is Black History Month, so this is our little breakfast, our little get together.

Donald Trump: Hi, Lynn , how are you?

Lynn: Hi. How are you?

Donald Trump: Good. Nice to see you.

Donald Trump: Just a few notes. During this month, we honor the tremendous history of the African-Americans throughout our country, throughout the world if you really think about it, right? And this story's one of unimaginable sacrifice, hard work and faith in America. I've gotten a real glimpse during the campaign, I'd go around with Ben to a lot of different places that I wasn't so familiar with. They're incredible people.

Donald Trump: And I want to thank Ben Carson who's going to be heading up HUD. It's a big job, and it's a job that's not only housing, it's mind and spirit, right, Ben? And you understand that. Nobody's gonna be better than Ben.

Donald Trump: Last month, we celebrated the life of Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., whose incredible example is unique in American history. You read all about Dr. Martin Luther King a week ago when somebody said I took the statue out of my office. And it turned out that that was fake news. Fake news. [Laughter]

Donald Trump: The statue is cherished, it's one of the favorite things in the -- and we have some good ones. We have Lincoln and we have Jefferson, we have Dr. Martin Luther King and we have -- but they said the statue, the bust of Dr. Martin Luther King was taken out of the office. And it was never even touched. So I think it was a disgrace. But that's the way the press is, very unfortunate.

Donald Trump: I am very proud now that we have a museum at the National Mall where people can learn about Reverend King, so many other things. Frederick Douglass is an example of somebody who has done an amazing job and is being recognized more and more, I notice. Harriet Tubman, Rosa Parks and millions more black Americans who made America what it is today. A big impact. I'm proud to honor this heritage and will be honoring it more and more.

Donald Trump: The folks at the table in almost all cases have been great friends and supporters. And Darryl , I met Darryl  when he was defending me on television. [Laughter]

Donald Trump: And the people that were on the other side of the argument didn't have a chance, right? And Paris  has done an amazing job in a very hostile CNN community. [Laughter]

Donald Trump: He's all by himself, seven people and Paris. And I'll take Paris  over the seven. [Laughter]

Donald Trump: But I don't watch CNN, so I don't get to see as much. [Laughter]

Donald Trump: I don't like watching fake news. [Crosstalk]

Donald Trump: So -- but Fox has treated me very nice. Wherever Fox is, thank you.

Donald Trump: We're going to need better schools and we need them soon. We need more jobs. We need better wages, a lot better wages. We're going to work very hard on the inner-city. Ben's going to be doing that, big league, big time. It's one of his big, big things that he's going to be looking at.

Donald Trump: We need safer communities and we're going to do that with law enforcement. We're going to make it safe. We're going to make it much better than it is right now. Right now, it's terrible. And I saw you talking about it the other night, Paris, on something else that was -- really, you did a fantastic job the other night on a very unrelated show.

Donald Trump: I'm ready to do my part [Inaudible] -- I'm ready to do my part. And I will say this, we're going to work together. This is a great group. This is a group that's been so special to me. You really helped me a lot. If you remember, I wasn't going to do well with the African American community, and after they heard me speaking and talking about the inner city and a lots of other things, we ended up getting -- I won't go into details -- but we ended up getting substantially more than other candidates who had run in the past years. And now we're going to take that to new levels.

Donald Trump: I want to thank my television star over here. [Laughter]

Donald Trump: Amarosa is actually a very nice person. Nobody knows that.  [Laughter]

Donald Trump: I don't want to destroy her reputation, but she is a very good person and she's been helpful right from the beginning of the campaign and I appreciate it. I really do -- very special. And so I want to thank everybody for being here.

Donald Trump: Could we maybe just go around the room and we'll introduce ourselves and the press can stay for that. And I'm sure they have no questions about last night because it was such a good launch. We have a fantastic hopefully new justice of the Supreme Court, and hopefully that will be -- he'll be approved very, very quickly. He's outstanding in every way. Academically, he's done almost as well as you did, Darrell, in college. [Laughter]

Donald Trump: Not quite, right? But he's a great -- a great man. I think he'll be a great, great justice and he's been very well received. It was a big evening, very big evening.

Donald Trump: So Paris, why don't we start with you? Go ahead.

Paris Dennard: Pleasure to be here, Mr. President; honored to be here. Paris Dennard. I'm with Thurgood Marshall College Fund. It represents the 47 publicly supported Historically Black Colleges and Universities, which I know you are very much in support of. So it's a pleasure to be here, sir.

Donald Trump: Well, thank you for supporting me, because I'd be all -- I'd be in wilderness without you. [Laughter]

Donald Trump: You are so effective. I appreciate it. [Crosstalk]

Donald Trump: Thank you.

Bill Cleveland: Bill Cleveland, retired Capitol Police officer; former vice mayor of the city of Alexandria, and substitute teacher in Alexandria school system. Glad to be here.

Donald Trump: Thank you. Thank you, Bill.

Earl Matthews: Bill's also a Vietnam veteran, sir. [Crosstalk]

Earl Matthews: I'm Earl Matthews, sir. I work for you at the U.S. Department of Defense. I was sworn in an hour after you were. So, I'm also a veteran, and a long-time supporter of yours. I worked for you since late summer and I'm happy to be here, sir.

Donald Trump: And a lieutenant colonel. Good job.

Earl Matthews: Yes sir.

Donald Trump: Our vice president... [Crosstalk]

Donald Trump: [Laughter] [Crosstalk]

Belinda Scott: [Inaudible] Belinda Scott, Darrell's wife, New Spirit Revival Center, from Cleveland, Ohio; pastor of New Spirit; great amount of support in that African American community where we are. We love the Lord. We love our new president. And we're praying for our president on a regular basis. That's [Inaudible]. [Crosstalk]

Donald Trump: You know, the one thing I remember [Inaudible] about Belinda, I thought they were married maybe five or six years, because look how they look so young. Should you say how many years you've been married?

Belinda Scott: Thirty-five.

Darrell Scott: Been together 38. [Crosstalk]

Belinda Scott: [Inaudible] but in the Lord... [Laughter]

Belinda Scott: Thirty-five years.

Darrell Scott: 38 under the blood. [Laughter]

Donald Trump: It's actually amazing. I would have never... [Crosstalk]

Belinda Scott: Can I say this? I'm so grateful that our president gives us the ear. You know, to listen to the community, to listen. And people like us are just here to constantly put that message out into the community.

Donald Trump: Thank you. That's so nice.

Belinda Scott: And we love you for that. We love you for listening and we thank you for that.

Donald Trump: Thank you. Thank you very much.

Darrell Scott: Darrell Scott, pastor, New Spirit Revival Center, and black Trump supporter. [Laughter] [Crosstalk]

Darrell Scott: But speaking of the community, let me just say this real quick. I also told you I'm [Inaudible]. I was recently contacted by some of the top gang thugs in Chicago for a sit-down. They reached out to me because they're so [Inaudible]. They respect you. They believe in what you're doing. And they wanted to have a sit-down about lowering their body count. So in a couple of weeks, I'm going to Chicago...

Donald Trump: It's a great idea because... [Crosstalk]

Donald Trump: ... Chicago is totally out of control.D. SCOTT:

Darrell Scott: Absolutely. [Inaudible] we've got to lower their body count. We don't want to talk about anything else; get that body count down. And they agreed that the principals  can do it. These are guys straight from the streets. No politicians; straight street guys. But they're gonna commit that if they lower that body count, we'll come in, we'll do some social programs. So they're...

Donald Trump: Well, if they're not going to solve the problem, and what you're doing is the right thing, then we're going to solve the problem for them because we're gonna have to do something about Chicago because what's happening in Chicago should not be happening in this country.

Darrell Scott: But they want to work with this administration.

Donald Trump: Good.

Darrell Scott: They want to. They reached out. I didn't reach out to them, they reached out to me. They want to work with this administration. They didn't believe in this administration. They didn't believe in the prior administration. They told me this out of their mouths that they see [Inaudible].

Donald Trump: I love that.

Armstrong Williams: Mr. President, I'm a member of the -- what we call the media when we try to be fair... [Laughter]

Armstrong Williams: ... and objective. Not all media seems to be in the opposition party. There are those that see good that you do and we're gonna report it [Inaudible].

Donald Trump: Thank you [Inaudible]. And it is. I mean, a lot of the media is actually the opposition party. They're so biased and really it's a disgrace. Some of the media's fantastic and fair, but so much of the media is opposition party, knowingly saying incorrect things. So it's a very sad situation, but we seem to be doing well. You know, it's almost like in the [Inaudible] we won. So maybe they don't have the influence they think.

Donald Trump: But they really are. They really have to straighten out their act. They're very dishonest people.

James Davis: Pastor James Davis. We've been a -- Mr. President, we've been a supporter of yours from the beginning, alongside Mr. Michael Cohen and Dr. Darrell Scott with the National Diversity Coalition helped to bring out a huge number in the back community with respect to the vote and we're still happy to be in support...

Donald Trump: Thank you.

James Davis: ... as we go forward.

Donald Trump: You've been great. Thank you.

Donald Trump: OK. And Lynne, we [Inaudible].

Lynne Patton: Hi, Mr. President. Yes, I am, as you know, the former vice president of the wonderful charity that your son founded, the Eric Trump Foundation.

Donald Trump: Right.

Lynne Patton: I've been with your family for about eight years now. Right, Jared ? And I will -- I was an RNC speaker and I will be landing  with Dr. Carson at HUD...

Donald Trump: That's great.

Lynne Patton: ... as one of his senior advisers and director of the Office of Public Liaison.
