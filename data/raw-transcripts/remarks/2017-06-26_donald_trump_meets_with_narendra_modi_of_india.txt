Donald Trump: Thank you very much. It's a great honor to have Prime Minister Modi of India, who has been such a great Prime Minister. I've been speaking with him, and reading about you, and you have done a great job. Economically, India's doing very well and so many other ways. So I'd like to congratulate you. I'd like to congratulate you very much.

Narendra Modi: Thank you.

Donald Trump: Would you like to say something?

Narendra Modi: [Via Translator, first in Hindi, then English] I think I'll have a lot to speak after the meeting. But the way I've been welcomed by the Honorable President and First Lady in Washington DC, I'm extremely grateful for them for they respect and for grand welcome. This is a welcome of 1.25 billion people of India. So I'm grateful to the Honorable President and First Lady. I do remember very well that when President Trump, when he was not even President of India, and when in a media interview he was asked about me, he was full of very warm remarks and observations to me. I still remember them today. Extremely grateful, but of course I will have a lot to speak after the meeting.

Donad Trump: Thank you very much. Thank you.
