Donald Trump: Thank you very much. It's an honor to have Prime Minister Turnbull, Mrs. Turnbull -- friends of mine and friends of Melania for, actually, quite some time.

Donald Trump: The relationship we have with Australia is a terrific relationship, and probably stronger now than ever before -- maybe because of our relationship, our friendship. But we're working on trade deals, we're working on military and protection, and all of the things that you would think we would be discussing today.

Donald Trump: We have a big meeting set up in a little while, and we have a luncheon set up, also. And we have all of our representatives surrounding us and a lot of good things will come out of this visit. So, Mr. Prime Minister, we very much appreciate you being here. Thank you very much.

Malcolm Turnbull: Well, thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. And I just say, thank you and Melania for your hospitality and your friendship.

Malcolm Turnbull: It's the 100 Years of Mateship that we're celebrating this year. One hundred years ago, for the first time, Australians and American soldiers went into battle together, in the Battle of Hamel on July the 4th, 1918, and we have been fighting side-by-side in freedom's cause ever since. So, a hundred years of mateship, and a hundred more to come.

Donald Trump: That's great. Thank you all very much.
