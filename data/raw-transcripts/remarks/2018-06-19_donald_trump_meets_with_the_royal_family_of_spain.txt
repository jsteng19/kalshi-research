Donald Trump: Well, thank you very much. It's a great honor to have the King and Queen of Spain, a beautiful country. We were in Spain not so long ago, and we love it. Very special people and a beautiful place.

Donald Trump: And our relationship has been outstanding over the years and, I think, especially right now. Excellent trade relationship, military relationship. Just about everything you can have. So we love Spain. And it's really a tremendous honor to have you both at the Oval Office. Thank you very much.

King Felipe VI: Thank you, Mr. President. I'd like to, first of all, thank you for your time. As you know, we had a visit around the country. We were visiting Texas and Louisiana. And this is a great end to a perfect visit.

King Felipe VI: We appreciate very much our common history, our heritage. So many years that we've shared. And we like to use that as a good benchmark for our very excellent relationships that we enjoy today.
