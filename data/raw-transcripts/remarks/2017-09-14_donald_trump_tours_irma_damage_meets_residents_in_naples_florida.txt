Donald Trump: Well, we love the people of Florida, and they went through something that, I guess the likes of which we can really say nobody's ever seen before. They've never seen a category like this coming, because it came in really as a five. All you have to do is look at what happened in the Keys.

Donald Trump: But we love these people, and we're going to be back, and we're going to help, and the job that everybody has done in terms of first responder and everybody has been incredible. And, and by the way that includes the people that live here, because you see the people immediately getting back to work to fix up their homes, like Bobby and like some of the others.

Donald Trump: So I just want to tell you we are there for you 100 percent. I'll be back here numerous times. I mean, this is a state that I know very well as you understand, and these are special, special people and we love them. Thank you. Thank you.

Audience Member: Thank you Mr. President.
