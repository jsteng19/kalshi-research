Donald Trump: A very special hello to all of the law enforcement heroes, family members, and friends of our police, who have come to the nation's capital this week to honor our brave men and women in blue. Every day, countless thousands of courageous officers, sheriffs, sheriff's deputies, troopers, and federal agents risk their lives to protect our communities and keep America safe.

Donald Trump: They stand firm in the face of crisis and faithfully pursue justice. They are the thin blue line, and it really is very special. It has to do with a thing called civilization and chaos. And we love them, we respect them, we salute them, and we thank them for their incredible, big, beautiful hearts. Today, on Peace Officers' Memorial Day, we especially honor those who have made the supreme sacrifice in defense of our laws.

Donald Trump: Last year, 147 officers gave their lives in the line of duty -- that's some high number. So terrible. So terrible. They were some of the great and very best among us. We cherish their memories, and we wrap our arms around the beautiful families that they left behind. We will honor their sacrifice for all time, and their loved ones will always have our infinite gratitude and unyielding support.

Donald Trump: On my first day in office, I signed an executive order directing Department of Justice to seek the death penalty for any criminal who murders a police officer. It was my wonderful honor to do it. I want every law enforcement officer across the country to know that you have a president who will always have your back.

Donald Trump: So thank you once again for what you do for our country. You are our great people. Great, great people. God bless our police officers, and God bless America.
