Donald Trump: Well, Mr. Secretary-General, you've become my friend. And we have had a lot of time together -- hours and hours -- talking about world problems, world events. And a lot of progress has been made. You know, I've long said that I think the United Nations is an institution with more potential than virtually any institution I can think of. It's called the "potential of war," which is bad, and "peace," which is great.

Donald Trump: And I think we've been doing a great job on the "peace" aspect of it. But we've had many great meetings with Angela and -- thank you very much. The Polish people are very happy. I've heard that today. They were very happy with your performance yesterday. Great job. But I just want to thank everybody for being here.

Donald Trump: It's an honor to have you in the United States, an honor to have you in New York City. And the United Nations is very, very special. And most importantly, I want to congratulate you on the incredible job you're doing. Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary-General. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. [Applause]
