Donald Trump: Thank you everybody. This is really an honor. We're going to win Ohio, right? Come here, Mike. We're going to win Ohio. We're going to win it all. Going to Make America Great Again. That's what we want to do. But the last time I got accused of speaking a little bit long, so this time we have to speak a lot short.

Donald Trump: But I just want to introduce a man who's become a friend of mine. Somebody who is going to make an unbelievable vice president of the United States, Governor Mike Pence.

Mike Pence: Thank you, Don. Let's hear it for the next president of the United States of America, Donald Trump. It is such an honor to join your family to welcome you to Cleveland. We're excited to hear you address the nation tomorrow night. It's been exciting to hear from your family more to come tonight. And I'm convinced, what begins in Cleveland will end in the White House.

Mike Pence: Thank you and God bless you. And welcome to Cleveland.

Donald Trump: Thank you very much Mike. I just also congratulate Don and Tiffany and Eric is going to have his shot tonight, and Eric's gonna be great, and Ivanka tomorrow night and my whole family. And Karen I want to just tell your whole family is an incredible family and we love having you with us in this endeavor and hopefully we're going to do an amazing job and an amazing job.
