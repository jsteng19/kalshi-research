JD Vance: I'm sure we'll talk about Russia, Ukraine, as well, but Mr. Foreign Secretary, it's good to see you. Welcome. Thank you.

David Lammy: Very good to see you. The special relationship, the Anglo-American relationship, is more than just an alliance. It's a covenant.

JD Vance: That's right.

David Lammy: Between two partners. And we're very pleased to be your partner across the sea. Last year, we met with both in opposition. We were talking about growth in our economies. We were talking about the problems we've got with controlling our borders. And, of course, we were talking about European security.

David Lammy: Uh, we're committed to increasing defense and encourage our friends across Europe to do the same. And, of course, we've got important issues to discuss on Ukraine and how we support Ukraine in this tough moment, um, and also broader issues, uh, of UK-US security.

JD Vance: Wonderful. Well, we're looking forward to it. Thank you, all. Good to see you.

Question: Do you think Russia should rejoin the G7?

JD Vance: Take care, guys.

Question: Thank you. Will you talk about Gaza? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, everyone. Thank you.

JD Vance: Good evening, everybody. How are we doing? Are we ready to make America great again? I just want to say we're so grateful to all of you. So grateful for making sure that we made this election too big to rig because that's exactly what we did. And we did it together. And, of course, I want to thank my dear friend and I think the best president that this country has had, a man -- A man who has put everything on the line for the United States of America and gets an opportunity to serve this great country once again, President Donald J. Trump.

JD Vance: So, do we want to hear from the 45th and 47th President of the United States? Take it away, sir.
