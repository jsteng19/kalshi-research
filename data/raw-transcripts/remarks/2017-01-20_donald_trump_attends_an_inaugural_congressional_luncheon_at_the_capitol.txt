Donald Trump: Thank you very much, Mitch and Paul and our great vice president. I don't think anybody wants to hear me speak any more today, right? So we'll cut it short. But we have so many of our Cabinet members here. I see my generals -- those generals are gonna keep us so safe. They're gonna have a lot of problems, the other side.

Donald Trump: They're gonna look at -- they're gonna look at a couple of them -- these are central casting. If I'm doing a movie, I pick you, General, General Mattis, who's doing really even. Even -- even Chuck likes General Mattis. And General Kelly. So -- and we had a very interesting talk. Kiddingly, he thinks we're doing great at the Cabinet level, but we're going to do just fine.

Donald Trump: We're going to do just fine. But you know, I'll tell you, there is something that I wanted to say because I was very honored, very, very honored when I heard that President Bill Clinton and Secretary Hillary Clinton was coming today and I think it's appropriate to say and I'd like you to stand up. I'd like you to stand up. And honestly, there's nothing more I can say because I have a lot of respect for those two people.

Donald Trump: So thank you for being here and we're going to have four great years hopefully of peace and prosperity and we'll be working very, very hard. Our Cabinet's lined up and ready. I know eventually, Chuck's gonna approve them, I'm sure. I really believe that. And we're all dealing (ph) together -- we all want to same thing, we're all good people, whether you're a Republican or Democrat, doesn't make any difference.

Donald Trump: We're going to get along. Again, thank you very much. It's an honor. And Roy, you have done a spectacular job, you and Tom Barrack. I want to thank you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much.
