Donald Trump: We had a very good phone call. It lasted for a long time. President Xi would like to do something. We'll see whether or not he can do it. But we will not be putting up with what's happening in North Korea.

Donald Trump: I believe that President Xi agrees with me 100 percent. He doesn't want to see what's happening there, either. We had a very, very frank and very strong phone call.

Question: Mr. President, are you considering military action?

Donald Trump: We're going to see what happens. We'll see what happens. Certainly, that's not our first choice, but we will see what happens. Thank you very much.
