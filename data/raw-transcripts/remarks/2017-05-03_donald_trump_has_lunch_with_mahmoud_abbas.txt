Donald Trump: It's a great honor to have President Abbas with us. We'll be having lunch together, we'll be discussing details of what has proven to be a very difficult situation between Israel and the Palestinians, and let's see if we can find the solution.

Donald Trump: It's something that I think is frankly maybe not as difficult as people have thought over the years, but we need two willing parties. We believe Israel is willing, we believe you're willing, and if you both are willing, we're going to make a deal. So, I want to thank everybody. I want to thank Rex Tillerson for being here. Rex, do you have anything to say?

Rex Tillerson: Mr. President, I think it's a historic opportunity, because there are a number of positive conditions in place. And I know, under your leadership and the willingness of the President, the Prime Minister, that we hope good things will happen.

Donald Trump: Thank you, Rex. And, Vice President Mike Pence, sitting right here, has been a longtime supporter of peace. And, certainly, peace between the Palestinians and Israel. And, Mike, would you like to say something?

Mike Pence: Thank you, Mr. President. I'd just like to welcome the President and his entire delegation here to the White House. It is good to see you again. My family and I had the privilege of your hospitality during a Christmas visit just a few short years ago, and we welcome you and look very much forward to our discussions.

Donald Trump: He's made great progress, hasn't he? He's doing a great job. And Rex is doing a fantastic job, also. Thank you all very much. Thank you.
