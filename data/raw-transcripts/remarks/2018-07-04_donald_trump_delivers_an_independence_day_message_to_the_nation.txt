Donald Trump: My fellow Americans. Melania and I are truly honored to wish every American a happy Independence Day. It was 242 years ago today in Philadelphia that 56 brave representatives of the American people adopted our Declaration of Independence.

Donald Trump: They announced to the world that America would be free, and America would be independent. They pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor. In so doing, they forever changed the course of human history.

Donald Trump: General George Washington and his army of brave patriots fought a long, tough war with the British to win America's freedom. When they did, from Bunker Hill to Saratoga to Yorktown, American soldiers fought and died to secure our independence, and to make a sovereign nation.

Donald Trump: Today, as we celebrate the 4th of July with friends and family, let us never forget that our freedom has been earned through with the blood and sweat and sacrifice of American heroes -- and these were great American heroes.

Donald Trump: And let us share the grateful heart of our nation, with every veteran and member of the United States Armed Forces -- truly special people. We are in awe of their courage and we are eternally in their debt.

Donald Trump: Together, we honor their noble sacrifice by pledging our love and loyalty to our country, our flag, and our fellow citizens. We are -- and will always be -- one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. Happy 4th of July, and God bless America.
