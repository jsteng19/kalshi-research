Donald Trump: I just want to say, it's a great honor to have the President of China and his incredibly talented wife, a great great celebrity in China -- a great singer -- it's an honor to have you in the United States.

Donald Trump: We've had a long discussion already, and so far I have gotten nothing, absolutely nothing [Laughter], but we have developed a friendship, I can see that.

Donald Trump: And I think long term we're going to have a very, very great relationship and I look very much forward to it. [Applause] Thank you all very much. Thank you.
