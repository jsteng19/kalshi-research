Donald Trump: Well, thank you very much. We have a great shipyard -- one of the great shipyards. It was having difficulty, and now it's in very good shape. We'll have a contract that goes about ten years in Wisconsin. They're going to build 20 ships larger than this one -- actually, this is about three-quarters the size.

Donald Trump: It would go from that wall to this wall, and they're magnificent, fast with tremendous firepower  -- all built in Wisconsin, so we're very happy about that. It's a big contract. Thank you. Thank you very much.
