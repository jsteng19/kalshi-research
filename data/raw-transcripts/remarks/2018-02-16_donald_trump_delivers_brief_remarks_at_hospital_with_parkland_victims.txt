Question: Mr. President, did you meet with any victims? Can you tell us about your visit, Mr. President?

Donald Trump: This is a fantastic hospital, and they have done an incredible job. The doctor was amazing. We saw numerous people and, incredible recovery. Incredible. And first responders, everybody, the job they've done is incredible and I want to congratulate you. [Shakes Doctor's Hand] Incredible job.

Question: Did you see the victims Mr. President?

Donald Trump: Yes I did. Yes I did. I did indeed and it's, uh, very sad something like that could happen. But the job the doctors did, the nurses, the hospital, first responders, law enforcement... really incredible. The speed they got the victims over to the hospital was, like, record setting. In one case, 20 minutes. In one case, 19 minutes from the time they were shot. It's an incredible thing. Thank you very much everybody.

Question: Do more gun laws need to be changed, Mr. President?
