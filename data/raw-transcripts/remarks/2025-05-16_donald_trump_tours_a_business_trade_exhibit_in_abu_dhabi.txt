Unidentified: Thank you.

Unidentified: [Inaudible] thank you.

Vicki Hollub: Hello, President Trump, how are you?

Donald Trump: [Inaudible]

Vicki Hollub: Good, good. [Inaudible] so good to see you. Great. How are you?

Donald Trump: [Inaudible] situation. [Inaudible] do they know [Inaudible]

Vicki Hollub: Pam Bondi is doing what she can [Inaudible]

Unidentified: [Inaudible]

Donald Trump: [Inaudible] they gave you a very fair deal. Do they know about her?

Unidentified: [Inaudible]

Donald Trump: [Inaudible] sure. [Inaudible]

Note: [Crosstalk]

Unidentified: [Inaudible]

Unidentified: [Inaudible] behind you on the screen. [Inaudible] this is [Inaudible] Gaza [Inaudible] energy -- this is what exists you're getting in our balance sheet [Inaudible] and it was [Inaudible] this we considered [Inaudible] which is our [Inaudible]

Donald Trump: [Inaudible] does that make sense? Is that [Inaudible] the press is here. [Inaudible] I'd like you to hear it. The investment that they're making [Inaudible] November 5th, but I think it's so impressive. I'd love to have you speak. We have some of the greatest people on earth in business, ExxonMobil, etc., and they could say a couple of words also.

Donald Trump: But this is a very big investment, you can see. And I'd love to have them speak, so that you could hear it as well as me. So please, go.

Unidentified: You can see on the map, we exist in [Inaudible] and assets in 18 different states. This spans the whole energy value chain from gas, development, reduction, acceleration, distribution and electrification, LNG terminals, energy infrastructure --

Donald Trump: So, the money that they're spending, they will be spending in the United States over a period of --

Unidentified: Well, our current investments are $70 billion.

Donald Trump: Right.

Unidentified: We committed $370 billion over the next 10 years, leading to $440 billion by 2035.

Donald Trump: $440 billion.

Unidentified: This will have an annual GDP impact of $29 billion US dollars and it will support 470,000 jobs. This is what Exxon [Inaudible] was created for. It's an internationally dedicated investment company focused on the energy value chain. The US has become an absolute imperative when it comes to our investment strategy.

Unidentified: We're investing across the value chain of gas, specialty chemicals, energy infrastructure, as well as technology. And here, this is just an example of how great and how well-cemented and deeply rooted the existing relationship would be.

Donald Trump: ExxonMobil is right here.

Unidentified: Exxon is investing with us here in the UAE and we're also investing with them in the US, Occidental Petroleum, and we will [Inaudible] Mr. President, with your permission just to give --

Donald Trump: Occidental Petroleum. This is the most powerful woman in the [Inaudible] presence. That's what they tell me. I don't know. What do I know?

Unidentified: So [Inaudible] have committed in new investments worth $60 billion US in upstream oil and gas as well as new unconventional opportunities. Please?

Unidentified: Well, Mr. President, we're obviously the largest -- ExxonMobil, the largest investor in oil and gas in the United States, we're also a large investor in the United Arab Emirates. ADNOC is a strategic partner of ours globally. We look at it as the best of both. Exxon brings the technology and the global experience.

Unidentified: ADNOC had a deep, deep capability set. The best of the both is the way we're developing businesses.

Donald Trump: Great. Great job you're doing.

Unidentified: Thank you.

Donald Trump: We appreciate it.

Unidentified: Thank you.

Donald Trump: The US appreciates it.

Unidentified: Thanks.

Unidentified: With Exxon, Mr. President, would like to present you with [Inaudible] the highest [Inaudible] lowest carbon [Inaudible] and that is what we both [Inaudible]

Unidentified: Hey, Howard, how are you? Good to see. You.

Donald Trump: So this is one drop of oil. Now, they think I'm happy with that. This is the highest quality oil there is on the planet, and they only gave me a drop.

Unidentified: [Inaudible]

Donald Trump: Can you imagine? But anyway -- but it's tremendous what you're doing.

Unidentified: [Inaudible] benchmark [Inaudible] ballpark.

Donald Trump: It'll be great. Yep. I know that very well. Everybody knows that.

Unidentified: Thanks.

Unidentified: Mr. President, thanks. [Inaudible]

Donald Trump: Thank you very much. Congratulations.

Unidentified: [Inaudible]

Donald Trump: Thank you very much.

Unidentified: How was your morning, sir?

Donald Trump: Do you want to say who you are?

Unidentified: Yeah. [Inaudible] represent [Inaudible] resources. We're excited to get a concession, first of its kind for unconventional oil resources here in Abu Dhabi, partnering with ADNOC, the leading energy company in the world. We're very excited to be here. We appreciate the opportunity.

Note: [Crosstalk]

Unidentified: I think it'll be the beginning of a long-term strategic partnership for both companies. [Inaudible] thank you very much.

Donald Trump: Thank you very much for the investment.

Vicki Hollub: I'm Vicki Hollub with Occidental Petroleum and we've been here 25 years. And together with ADNOC, we took on one of the most difficult projects here in the UAE and that was to build the largest ultra-sour gas processing plant in the world, in the middle of the desert, where it took 43,000 people at the peak of construction.

Vicki Hollub: We had to build a small city for that and we built it on time and on budget because of the strength of the ADNOC technical capabilities along with ours. But now we're going to take that technical expertise, we're going to expand that plant from the one BCF a day that it was. They've already expanded it to 1.4, and now we're going to take it up to 1.8 times that.

Vicki Hollub: So that technology is going well for us and we've been highly successful with it. The next technology that we'll partner with ADNOC on is in the United States. It's our direct air capture facility that will take CO2 out of the atmosphere and use that CO2 in our oil reservoirs to enhance our production and extend the energy independence of the United States.

Donald Trump: And the profits all go to the United States and also the firms used to do the building, most of them, a lot of them, and the equipment purchased is made in the United States. So it's been an amazing relationship and we have a few others that we're going to show you also, but this has been great. Congratulations.

Unidentified: Thank you, Mr. President.

Donald Trump: It's a great job. Scott, do you have anything to say, and Howard?

Scott Bessent: Sir, this has been an incredible trip in terms of bringing foreign direct investments into the US and solidifying our position via with our partners. And seeing you with these leaders over the past three days has been an incredible experience and it's going to enhance the partnership and grow the US economy, so peace and prosperity.

Donald Trump: And I only got one drop. One drop.

Unidentified: But it's high quality, sir.

Scott Bessent: We're working on a barrel.

Unidentified: We'll send you a barrel. We'll send you a barrel. We'll send it.

Donald Trump: Howard?

Howard Lutnick: The AI Industrial Revolution is coming to the world and it needs power. And so our focus is going to be to dramatically increase the power of production in America. We're going to bring our partners with us, we're going to do it together and we're going to try to double the power capacity of the United States of America under your leadership, so this is incredibly exciting.

Donald Trump: Well, you saw what was presented last night and there's nothing like that anywhere in the world. And the United States is the big beneficiary, and now they're also moving into many sites like what you saw last night and actually, will actually even be bigger. And we have many of those already committed and going forward.

Donald Trump: Some of them have already started and we've got their permits in record time. Otherwise it would be years and years waiting. Their permits, they've already gotten. In fact, a couple of them that you know very well, the biggest in the business said we can't believe it. We [Inaudible] a permit to build an electric plant and we got it in very short [Inaudible] so it's really been amazing and we're going to go through a list of a couple of different groups and you see some incredible investment going back into the US.

Unidentified: OK.

Unidentified: That's all right. Thank you.

Donald Trump: [Inaudible] this will be healthcare.

Unidentified: Hi, good morning. Nice to see you again.

Unidentified: Where's your full camera view? Full camera. CBS, where are you?

Unidentified: Mr. President [Inaudible]

Donald Trump: Wait one second [Inaudible] we're going to [Inaudible]

Unidentified: Right here. Yes, sir.

Unidentified: Right here. [Inaudible] right here [Inaudible]

Unidentified: All right, sir.

Donald Trump: So this is very interesting on health care, and if you could take it away?

Unidentified: Yes, sir. You'll pick up on my colleague [Inaudible] just now about energy, yeah? In the UAE, we change the formula of Einstein of E equals MC squared to E equals to I. Energy equals intelligence. And last night, you unveiled an amazing project, the largest intelligence factory to be built outside the United States and we believe the best use case of intelligence, AI, is in healthcare.

Unidentified: As much as we follow our colleague, Elon Musk, going to the outer space, we believe the inner space of humanity need to be better as well, and that's why healthcare is so critical. If you allow me [Inaudible]

Unidentified: Here's a brief overview of working [Inaudible] together with our US partners, including [Inaudible] intelligence means low cost, and high-quality equal access for all. We have linked all the hospitals and ecosystem of healthcare providers, patients and payers in a single network. So all the data is in one single place, no paperwork everywhere.

Unidentified: We already are applying AI from medical reading, the documentation across all hospitals in England, and 4.5 billion numbers of medical and insurance records are consolidated. Most importantly, we have the largest [Inaudible] in the [Inaudible] almost one million people have been sequenced.

Donald Trump: So this is going to make a tremendous difference on health. You're just going to find out what's wrong with somebody a lot quicker.

Unidentified: 100 percent.

Donald Trump: That's great.

Unidentified: You know, we invent the large language model. It unlocked the secret of human thinking and communication is now in the field of biology because our biology is using languages like English, Russian or any other language. This is a new AI platform for living with our American partners.

Donald Trump: I was just going to introduce, Cleveland Clinic is here and the gentleman from Oracle, representing Larry Ellison [Inaudible] Larry is a great -- he's a great guy, a great man, and you have been the best partners. And again, they're working here. They're US companies and it's all ultimately coming back to the US and we'll be doing even bigger versions of this.

Donald Trump: This is a real pioneering thing and so many good things are going to come out of AI. But most of you haven't seen yet, but the number of plants being built in the United States is at a level that nobody can even imagine [Inaudible] and the big ones, right? [Inaudible] and what we showed last night was fantastic.

Donald Trump: It was good [Inaudible] with a great leader. [Inaudible] would you like to say [Inaudible]

Unidentified: [Inaudible] Cleveland Clinic --

Note: [Crosstalk]

Unidentified: You can see here, since 2008, there was just this small island. And [Inaudible] in 2025, this is Cleveland Clinic in [Inaudible]

Donald Trump: Some difference, isn't it?

Unidentified: Yeah. [Inaudible] that is transforming healthcare in this part of the [Inaudible] so now 10 years since the opening, it has become the best hospital here in the region. And people [Inaudible] from all over the country to experience the best of US healthcare that is available here in the United Arab Emirates.

Donald Trump: And AI is going to really take it over?

Unidentified: And AI is going to [Inaudible] this is going to make Cleveland better, scalable and available to people in the United States as well as here in the UAE and ultimately, all over the world and that's why the collaboration with Oracle is so important.

Donald Trump: Two great US companies benefiting and it comes back to our country and they're doing things like this and even at a bigger level. Go ahead, please.

Unidentified: Yeah. Thank you very much. It's a tremendous honor to partner with the Cleveland Clinic and G42. This AI platform that they're rolling out in the United States, and in Abu Dhabi here at Cleveland Clinic. It's not just about making it a little bit better, it's about making things dramatically better, reinventing health care, reinventing the technology around health care and bending the cost curve down.

Unidentified: People get sick, but knowing what's wrong with them more and more quickly and then perhaps even more importantly, keeping them from getting sick in the first place. And the [Inaudible] aggregating all this data. And again, we're just honored, and thank you, Mr. President, for all the support to make this possible.

Donald Trump: I'm just thinking, we have a president of the United States doing the selling. Do you think Biden would be doing it? I don't think so. But it's so important. I think -- I have to be a cheerleader for our country. And that's why our country is doing so well and it's people like this [Inaudible] we appreciate it. Great job at Cleveland Clinic.

Donald Trump: Say hello to Larry. And now we'll take a look at aviation.

One of the most important things that this is going to get used for [Inaudible] trillion worth of [Inaudible] create jobs [Inaudible]

Donald Trump: That's right.

Unidentified: We're glad with this relationship. It's been an impressive relationship we've had [Inaudible] Boeing and GE. And Mr. President, we are also doubling our capacity and our fleet. We're growing from 57 to an easy 100 aircrafts. I just finish the deal also with Boeing so far and it's been an incredible relationship.

Unidentified: Do you want to say a few words, Stephanie?

Unidentified: Sure. [Inaudible] partnership with Etihad as well as with [Inaudible] we appreciate your support and leadership. We look forward to [Inaudible]

Unidentified: Mr. President, our backbone [Inaudible] is actually Boeing. [Inaudible] Mr. President, and tells you a lot about the relationship that we have with the US. And our CEO also --

Donald Trump: You are mostly going for [Inaudible] --

Unidentified: Yes, sir.

Donald Trump: -- completely [Inaudible]

Unidentified: The backbone, we have 70 percent or more.

Donald Trump: It's just my opinion, but Boeing makes the best client, and they've had some headaches over the last few years, but they make the best plane, and you see what's happening. And it's not the only case, but a lot of people are ordering the Boeing jets and they're gearing up. And I think it's going to be one of the great -- really one of the great stories.

Donald Trump: And the General Electric engine is phenomenal. The big body General Electric engine is phenomenal, so it's great to see. Thank you. So you focus on Boeing [Inaudible]

Unidentified: Yes, and [Inaudible]

Note: [Crosstalk]

Donald Trump: It's a hot engine.

Unidentified: But there's --

Donald Trump: That's great. Twenty percent less fuel. That sounds good.

Unidentified: Mr. President, we have --

Donald Trump: How many engines will they be behind then, ultimately?

Unidentified: Oh, about 100 [Inaudible]

Donald Trump: Are they the biggest engines at this point?

Unidentified: [Inaudible]

Donald Trump: That's the biggest one? That's the one we're hearing about?

Unidentified: Yeah. And [Inaudible]

Donald Trump: They had a breakthrough, GE, on engines. Their big engine is the hottest engine there is. So it's through the roof and General Electric, you talk about a comeback. General Electric has made one of the great comebacks and it's both in health care and other things. But on your engine, I think that's really, maybe, the greatest story of them all.

Donald Trump: They came out with a way to make a better engine with 20 percent less fuel and that's a tough combination. So congratulations. I was with Larry yesterday and he's done a fantastic job.

Unidentified: And great customer service. [Inaudible] --

Donald Trump: Yeah, yeah.

Unidentified: -- which is very [Inaudible]

Donald Trump: It's true.
