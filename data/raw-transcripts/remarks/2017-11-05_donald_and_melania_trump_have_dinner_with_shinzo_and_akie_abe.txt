Donald Trump: Thank you very much for being here. We are in the midst of having very major discussions on many subjects, including North Korea, and trade, and other things, and we're doing very well. We've been doing very well, and the relationship is really extraordinary.

Donald Trump: We like each other, and our countries like each other, and I don't think we've ever been closer to Japan than we are right now. So it's a great honor. Believe me, it's a great honor.

Donald Trump: We're going to have dinner tonight, where I think we'll insult everybody by continuing to talk about trade. But, the time is a little bit limited and then tomorrow is a very busy day. So thank you all for being here. We appreciate it. Thank you very much.
