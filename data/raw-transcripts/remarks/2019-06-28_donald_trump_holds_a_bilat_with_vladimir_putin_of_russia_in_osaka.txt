Donald Trump: Thank you very much everybody. It's a great honor to be with President Putin, his representatives, my representatives. We have many things to discuss, including trade, and including some disarmament and some -- a little protectionism, perhaps, in a very positive way. And we're going to discuss a lot of different things.

Donald Trump: We've had great meetings. We have had a very, very good relationship. And we look forward to spending some pretty good time together. A lot of very positive things going to come out of the relationship. So, Vladimir, thank you very much. Thank you.

Vladimir Putin: Thank you, Mr. President. [Via interpreter] Well, I cannot but agree with Mr. President. We have something to discuss here. All the topics have been outlined.

Vladimir Putin: [Via interpreter] Thank you very much, both teams, for that. Thank you for your time.

Donald Trump: Thank you very much. Thank you.
