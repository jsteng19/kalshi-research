Donald Trump: Well, thank you very much, Mr. Secretary General. I have to say that, as someone born in New York and raised in New York, it is a great honor to have the United Nations in New York, and always has been.

Donald Trump: For years I've been a critic, but I've also been somebody that said that the United Nations has tremendous potential. And under your leadership -- and I've seen what you've done and working with Nikki Haley and all of her friends. She's made so many friends here, and Rex Tillerson, likewise, has become, really a fixture here. We're working very hard to solve world problems.

Donald Trump: But there is no better forum; there can be no better forum. And certainly there can be no better location where everybody comes together. So, I want to congratulate you -- the word is "potential." The potential of the United States, in terms of what it has done has been wonderful. But we can do better, and we're going to.

Donald Trump: The potential of the United Nations is unlimited, and I really believe -- I've met your representatives, and I know you well. You are going to do things that will be epic, and I certainly hope you will. But I feel very, very confident.

Donald Trump: So I just want to toast everybody in the room. And let's give this, as a toast, to the potential -- the great, great potential of the United Nations. Thank you all for being here. Thank you very much. [A toast is made]
