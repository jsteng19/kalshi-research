Shinzo Abe: [Via Interpreter] So over lunch, we had an in-depth discussion to cover various challenges of the international community, including the issue of North Korea.

Shinzo Abe: [Via Interpreter] So to build on the discussion that we had over lunch, I very much look forward to continuing our discussion mainly on global affairs as well as our economic issues and also our bilateral issues.

Donald Trump: Well, thank you very much. It was indeed a good meeting, and mostly pertaining to trade, North Korea and a couple of other subjects that we lightly touched on.

Donald Trump: We're making tremendous progress I believe on trade in particular, bringing the deficits down and having a very fair and equal trade, and I look forward to finishing up the discussions.

Donald Trump: A lot of great work and great friendships have been built and they will continue to be built. Thank you very much. Thank you.
