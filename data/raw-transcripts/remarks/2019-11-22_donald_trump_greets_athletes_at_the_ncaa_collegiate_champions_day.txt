Donald Trump: Thank you very much, everybody. We're having a great year. This has been an amazing year for our economy. And meeting these athletes -- they're real athletes, I can tell you. It's a tremendous achievement. And we're bringing many of them over to the Oval Office. I guess all of them. So far, nobody has turned that one down -- [Laughter] -- because it is a special place.

Donald Trump: They want to be there within 25 years, somebody out of here. So -- but we had a -- we've had a great time. This has been the best economy we've ever had. We're up again today. We have a lot of things going. The China deal is coming along very well. It's a question of whether or not I want to make it. And tremendous things are happening.

Donald Trump: I think we had a tremendous week with the hoax. You know, the great hoax. They call it the "impeachment hoax." And that's really worked out incredibly well. And we have tremendous support. I think Roger is around here someplace. I don't think I've ever seen support in the Republican Party like we do right now. We've never had this kind of support.

Roger Williams: We're with you all the way, Mr. President.

Donald Trump: Yeah, thank you very much, Roger. I'll see you -- I'll see you over at the -- we'll see you over at the Oval Office.

Question: Should the whistleblower be fired, Mr. President?

Donald Trump: What whistleblower? I don't think there is. I consider it to be a fake whistleblower, because what we he wrote didn't correspond to what I said in any way, shape, or form. Thank you very much everybody.

Question: Why don't you fire this person then? They're still in your administration, Mr. President.

Donald Trump: Thank you very much everybody.
