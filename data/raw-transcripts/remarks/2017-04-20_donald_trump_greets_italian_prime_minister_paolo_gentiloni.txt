Donald Trump: A great welcome to the Prime Minister of Italy. We're going to have a long discussion and it's a very great honor to have you.

Paolo Gentiloni: Thank you Mr. President. I'm really pleased to be here. I was saying to the President... waiting for his visit to Sicily next month.

Donald Trump: Yes, I look forward to that very much. I imagine many of these people will be going, but we look forward to it very much. Thank you very much.
