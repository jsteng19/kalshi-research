Donald Trump: My fellow Americans. At this holy time of the year, families across our nation gather in homes, churches, and synagogues to light candles and to praise God.

Donald Trump: During the sacred holiday of Passover, Jewish families around the world give thanks to God for liberating the Jewish people from bondage in Egypt and delivering them to the promised land of Israel.

Donald Trump: For Christians, we remember the suffering and death of God's only son and his glorious resurrection on the third day. On Easter Sunday we proclaim with joy, Christ is risen.

Donald Trump: Both of these sacred celebrations remind us that God's love redeems the world. Almost three thousand years ago, the prophet Isaiah wrote darkness covers the Earth, but the Lord rises upon you and his glory appears over you, for the Lord will be your everlasting light.

Donald Trump: In America, we look to the light of God to guide our steps. We trust in the power of the Almighty for wisdom and strength, and we praise our Heavenly Father for the blessings of freedom,and the gift of eternal life.

Donald Trump: Happy Passover. Happy Easter. Thank you. God bless you, and God bless America.
