Donald Trump: Thank you very much. This is the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and we've had a very productive meeting. It's going to continue after you leave. But we've had a very, very productive meeting.

Donald Trump: Our military is very strong, more -- more so than it's been in many, many years. I think I can say "in many, many decades."

Donald Trump: We've spent one and half trillion dollars rebuilding our military, and it shows it. And we are discussing various things. And, with that, thank you very much. Thank you.
