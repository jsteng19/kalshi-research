Donald Trump: Well, thank you very much. You are a man of great honor and respect, and it's an honor to be with you. And thank you for having us. And we want to thank Vietnam and the Vietnamese people. They have been so terrific. They greeted us with such respect and, really, such affection. The relationship is so healed. And to think where we were and where we've come is a tribute to both countries.

Donald Trump: We have so many things in common. We have been discussing at great length, today and yesterday, trade -- and trade, in particular, with Vietnam. And we're opening up and you're opening up, and it's going to even out. And we're both going to do very well for our people. Trade has become a very important element of our relationship and it will continue onward.

Donald Trump: And again, I want to thank you very much for this. It is a true honor to be with you. Thank you.
