Donald Trump: Look, we have a tragedy, we're gonna do... and what happened in Las Vegas is in many ways a miracle. The police department has done such an incredible job, and we'll be talking about gun laws as time goes by.

Donald Trump: But I do have to say how quickly the police department was able to get in was really very much of a miracle. They've done an amazing job. Go ahead.

Question: [Inaudible, relating the mayor of San Juan]

Donald Trump: Well, I think she's come back a long way, and you know I think it's now acknowledged what a great job we've done, and people are looking at that. And in Texas and in Florida we get an A+ and I'll tell you what: I think we've done just as good in Puerto Rico, and it's actually a much tougher situation.

Donald Trump: But now the roads are clear, communications starting to come back. We need their truck drivers, Their drivers have to start driving trucks. We have to do that.

Donald Trump: So, at a local level, they have to give us more help, but I will tell you, the first responders, the military, FEMA.

Donald Trump: They have done an incredible job in Puerto Rico and whether it's her or anybody else, they're all starting to say it. I appreciate very much the governor and his comments. He has said we have done an incredible job and that's the truth.

Question: [Inaudible]

Donald Trump: We'll talk about that later.

Question: [Inaudible, relating to Las Vegas]

Donald Trump: He was a sick man, a demented man, a lot of problems. I guess and we're looking into him very, very seriously, but we're dealing with a very, very sick individual. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
