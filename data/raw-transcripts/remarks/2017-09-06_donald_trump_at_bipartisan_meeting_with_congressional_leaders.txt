Donald Trump: Thank you very much. We have the Congressional leaders here with us today. And we have a lot to discuss, including the fact that there's a new -- and seems to be record-breaking -- hurricane heading right toward Florida and Puerto Rico and other places. We'll see what happens,

Donald Trump: We'll know in a very short period of time, but it looks like it could be something that will be not good, believe me, not good.

Donald Trump: We have many, many things that are on the plate. Hopefully we can solve them in a rational way, and maybe we won't be able to. We'll probably know pretty much at the end of this meeting or the meetings that we'll be having over a short period of time.

Donald Trump: But our country has a lot of great assets, and we have some liabilities that we have to work out. So we'll see if we can do that.

Donald Trump: I appreciate everybody being here. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Nancy, Chuck, appreciate it very much. And thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much.
