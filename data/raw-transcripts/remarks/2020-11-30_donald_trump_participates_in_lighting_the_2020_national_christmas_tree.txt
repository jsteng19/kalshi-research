Unidentified: Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States and Mrs. Trump.

Donald Trump: Well, thank you very much, everyone, and a very merry Christmas to all. It's going to be a great year. Tonight, we're honored to continue the nearly 100 year ceremony of lighting the national Christmas tree. That's really something. I want to thank the National Park Foundation, the National Park Service and students from all across the country who helped us really with such a magnificent tree.

Donald Trump: They designed it. They put up the ornaments and they're very, very special. The First Lady will do a very special honor also of right now lighting the national Christmas tree. And please join me from your homes and all over the country, and in fact, all over the world as we light our great tree. We'll start with five, four, three, two, one. [The tree is lit, music is played]
