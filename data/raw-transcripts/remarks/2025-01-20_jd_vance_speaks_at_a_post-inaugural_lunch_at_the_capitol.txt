JD Vance: How are we doing? Yeah, isn't a great day to make the 45th president of the United States the 47th president of the United States? Just say first of all, thank you to all of you for your support, for your kindness, for your friendship, for believing enough in this country to fight for it and make Donald J. Trump the president America needs at this moment in time.

JD Vance: We love you, and we're grateful to you. And second, I want to thank the president for his trust that he's placed in me but most importantly for the willingness to sacrifice, to serve, to fight through all, and let's be honest and call it what it is, fight through all of the lies and the bullshit to serve the American people once again.

JD Vance: So, I'm going to introduce the 45th and 47th president of the United States, and we are lucky to have him. God bless you all.
