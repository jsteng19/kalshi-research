Donald Trump: [Audience chants "Four more years"] Hello, everybody. [Inaudible] over there in two seconds. Thank you very much, everybody. It's great to be with you. I'm going to a battleship. Did you ever hear of a battleship... The North Carolina, right? So we're going to say hello to some of our incredible veterans, and it's really... Boy, this is a lot of people.

Donald Trump: I thought there might be a few people. So we won a big race in 2016 and they say the enthusiasm right now is far greater than even 2016. I have to say this: this is the most important election in the history of our country. I really believe that. Because we're running against people that have got some big issues.

Donald Trump: They've got some big, big problems. They're stone-cold crazy, and we have to keep our country. As you know, Joe Biden, he doesn't have a clue. We can't let it happen to our country. We're making strides. You know, the stock market's hitting another high. That means your stocks, your 401(k)s. We have to do what we're doing.

Donald Trump: The country's coming back really strongly. I'm going to say hello to this group, then I'm going to say hello to that group, and then I'll say a few words in the middle, okay? Thank you. I'll be right there. Yeah, if you could just hold that for -- just hold it.
