Donald Trump: Well, thank you very much, everybody. It's a great honor to have President Kuczynski with us from Peru. Peru has been a fantastic neighbor. We've had great relationships -- better now than ever before. And I have known him for quite a while through reading about the work that he's done, and I believe he's here to get an award at Princeton. An award for what? Explain, please.

Pedro Pablo Kuczynski: For being an alumnus who did okay, I guess. [Laughter]

Donald Trump: Yeah, did very okay. And your daughter goes to --

Pedro Pablo Kuczynski: Alex? Oh, my other daughter, Susie, goes to Princeton.

Donald Trump: Right. That's exactly right.

Pedro Pablo Kuczynski: She wants to study medicine.

Donald Trump: And I assume she's very proud of you getting the big award tomorrow, right?

Pedro Pablo Kuczynski: Right. And Alex went to Columbia.

Donald Trump: That's great. Good students, good children. So a very, very special man, and it's an honor to have him in Washington, at the White House. And we're going to talk some business. I understand they're going to be buying quite a bit of our military -- some of our military vehicles. And they are great vehicles. I just looked at it and we're approving it. And use them well. Use them well.

Donald Trump: And if you'd like to say something, Mr. President, please.

Pedro Pablo Kuczynski: Well, I'm happy to be in Washington. I lived here for a while. I lived in New York. We greatly respect the U.S. We have excellent relations. And Latin America needs to grow more, and we're going to talk about how to do that. Maybe you have a few ideas.

Donald Trump: I guess I do. I guess I do. And we have a problem with Venezuela. They're doing very poorly. And so we'll be talking about a lot of different things.

Donald Trump: And thank you all for being here. Thank you.
