Donald Trump: My fellow Americans, the heartbreaking devastation caused by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma and Maria and Nate, along with the terrible wildfires in California, have impacted millions of our fellow Americans.

Donald Trump: As a nation, we mourn for those who died, and we pray for those who lost their homes or their livelihoods. In the aftermath of these terrible storms, the American people have done what we do best. We came together, we helped one another and through it all, we remain resilient.

Donald Trump: We came together as one, as we rushed to the aid of Texas, Louisiana Florida, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. Now, as we begin to rebuild, some of America's finest public servants, are spearheading the One America Appeal.

Donald Trump: Through this effort, all five living former presidents are playing a tremendous role in helping our fellow citizens recover. To Presidents Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, Melania, and I want to express our deep gratitude for your tremendous assistance.

Donald Trump: This wonderful effort reminds us that we truly are one nation, under God, all unified by our values and our devotion to one another. I also want to thank every person, including everyone here tonight, who has contributed to this vital effort.

Donald Trump: There is a lot of work ahead of us, and I want to thank groups like the Points of Light, for making such a big difference in our disaster response efforts. Together, we will recover, we will rebuild, and we will come back stronger and better than ever before.

Donald Trump: Thank you, God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America.
