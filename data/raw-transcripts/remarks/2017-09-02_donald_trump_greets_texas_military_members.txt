Donald Trump: And I gave the commencement speech this year at the Coast Guard academy, and they're gonna come out and compete with you guys now pretty soon, you know that right? So I want to congratulate you, you guys, the army guys. This has been, I mean, it's brutal, what was up there.

Donald Trump: But you have done so much for the service. And we respect... and the whole world is watching. The whole world is watching. So I want to thank you. And I want to thank... look at all these. Thank you fellas, thank you everybody. Thank you.
