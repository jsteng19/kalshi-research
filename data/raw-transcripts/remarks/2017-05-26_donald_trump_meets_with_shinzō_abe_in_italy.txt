Donald Trump: Thank you you very much. It's great to have Prime Minister Abe, a friend of mine and somebody... we've just developed a great relationship. And it's wonderful to have you here. We'll be discussing many things, including, of course, North Korea, which is very much on our minds. We'll be discussing terrorism, but I think we will really be, in particular, focused on the North Korean problem. It's a big problem, it's a world problem, and it will be solved. At some point, it will be solved. You can bet on that. And I just want to thank you very much, thank you.

Shinzō Abe: [Via Translator] Hello, it's a great pleasure for me to see you again. There's one unfortunate thing that I have to confess. This time around, we won't be able to play golf together. [Laughter]

Shinzō Abe: [Via Translator] And also, at the outset, I'd like to congratulate you on your successful visit to the Middle East region, as well as your participation in the NATO summit. And through your visit, I understand that you have demonstrated robust commitment to ensuring global security. And I highly value your commitment.

Shinzō Abe: [Via Translator] Of course, as you mentioned, we are going to talk about North Korean issues, but also, we are going to cover other areas -- challenges of the international community. And on this occasion, I would like to reconfirm our close partnership, as well as collaboration, in addressing those of the challenges.

Donald Trump: Well, I want to say that it is reconfirmed. It is a close partnership and collaboration, and friendship. We've developed a great friendship, and I look forward to being with you, spending some time with you, and I'll be seeing you through today. And I'll be seeing you, I'm sure, many times over the years to come. And I look forward to that. Thank you.

Donald Trump: Thank you very much.
