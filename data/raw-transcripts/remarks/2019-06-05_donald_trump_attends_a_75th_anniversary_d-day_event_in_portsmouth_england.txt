Donald Trump: Almighty God: Our sons, pride of our nation, this day have set upon a mighty endeavor, a struggle to preserve our Republic, our religion, and our civilization, and to set free a suffering humanity.

Donald Trump: They will need Thy blessings... For the enemy is strong. He may hurl back our forces, but we shall return again and again; and we know that by Thy grace, and by the righteous [sic] of our cause, our sons will triumph...

Donald Trump: Some will never return. Embrace these, Father, and receive them, the [sic] heroic servants, into Thy kingdom... And, O Lord, give us faith. Give us faith in Thee; faith in our sons; faith in each other; faith in our united crusade...

Donald Trump: Thy will be done, Almighty God. Amen.
