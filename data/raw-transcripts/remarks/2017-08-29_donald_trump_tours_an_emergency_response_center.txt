Donald Trump: Well, first of all, I want to thank Governor Abbott. This has been an experience, really, like unfortunately we've never had before. There's never been anything like this.

Donald Trump: But it's showing some tremendous love and coordination, and so many things are coming out in Texas. And I will tell you, the whole country, the whole world, is really seeing and gaining such respect for everybody. And the job you have done is incredible. What you've done is, under circumstances -- I said before the word "epic"" and ""historic."" These are words used to describe this monster known as Harvey. "

Donald Trump: But the job you've done is really special. And I said, let's fly over, let's see these great people. The nerve center. You're really the nerve center. And we appreciate it very much, and millions of people appreciate it, that I can tell you. But the world is watching and the world is very impressed with what you're doing.

Donald Trump: So I just want to thank you on behalf of myself, the First Lady, the Governor. Nim, you have been incredible, working with our man. He's doing okay, right?

W. Nim Kidd: give him an A+.

Donald Trump: He's doing great. But FEMA has been just working along with everybody. And the coordination, I think as much as anything else, everybody is talking about it. The coordination has been beautiful to watch.

Donald Trump: So to the two of you in particular, I want to say congratulations. Thank you very much for everything. And go out and do it. It's going to be long term; it's not going to be a quick one. It's going to be long term. But we appreciate it very much. Thank you.
