Donald Trump: It is a pleasure to be with the newly elected President of France, who ran an incredible campaign and had a tremendous victory. All over the world, they're talking about it, and we have a lot to discuss, including terrorism and other things. And, congratulations, great job.

Emmanuel Macron: Thank you very much. [In French] For my part, I'm also very happy to be with President Trump. We have an extremely large agenda to discuss: the fight against terrorism, the economy, climate and energy. The occasion of the NATO summit also allows us to have a first meeting, and I am very happy to be able to change many things together.

Donald Trump: Thank you very much. Thank you.
