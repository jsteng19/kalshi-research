Donald Trump: Well, thank you very much. It's a pleasure to have President Rajoy with us. We will be discussing with our various representatives lots of different issues; among them is trade. And the United States is changing many of its trade deals, it's renegotiating many of its trade deals.

Donald Trump: We've had a really great first nine months, I would say, with Spain. It's a special place. It's a special country with incredible people.

Donald Trump: So, Mr. President, it is an honor to have you with us, and we look forward to spending the day. Thank you.

Mariano Rajoy: [In Spanish, no translation given]

Donald Trump: We are very much involved in the fight against terrorism together. We're comparing notes and we're comparing intelligence. And we are very, very unified in that fight. As you know, Spain is also very involved.

Donald Trump: And it's an unfortunate situation, but these are -- the times are changing. And we're being very, very strong on terrorism, as you see. We have had tremendous success in the Middle East, in Iraq and in Syria, in terms of ISIS and in terms of what we've done to get rid of this threat.

Donald Trump: But we work very closely with Spain, and we'll be very successful. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you.
