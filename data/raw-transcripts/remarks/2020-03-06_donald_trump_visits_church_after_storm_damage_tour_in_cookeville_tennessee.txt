Question: Mr. President, what's your impression of how the people have reacted to this (inaudible)?

Donald Trump: Incredible. The people are incredible. We spoke -- what they've done with the first responding and all of the care -- emergency, fire, every aspect of it. The law enforcement was really not law enforcement. They just went out, and they went out and did a great job of safety.

Donald Trump: Because you have such a great people here, you don't have to worry about the law enforcement; you have to worry about just helping them. And you did it. You did a fantastic job. I want to thank you for that. What a job you did. We're all talking about it too. So I hope they talk about it because you deserve it.

Donald Trump: Thank you all. We're going to make a couple of other stops. We're going to CDC later on, but this is inspiring to see the way it all came together. Even all of this -- Churches of Christ -- tremendous amounts of food and goods, and it all came within a matter of hours.

Donald Trump: So it's a case study -- a case study of what should be done and how it can be done. It's Tennessee.

Marsha Blackburn: The Volunteer State.

Donald Trump: It is indeed the Volunteer State. Thank you all very much. Great job.
