Donald Trump: Okay, thank you very much. It's my great honor to have Giuseppe Conte of Italy. He's a man who's doing a fantastic job. I really want to thank you very much for being here. We've become friendly over the G7 meetings and some phone calls.

Donald Trump: And I agree very much what you're doing with respect to migration and illegal immigration, and even legal immigration. Italy has taken a very firm stance on the border, a stance a few countries have taken. And, frankly, you're doing the right thing, in my opinion. And a lot of other countries in Europe should be doing it also. Some have taken that stance a long time ago, and they're doing a lot better.

Donald Trump: So I just want to thank you, Giuseppe, for being with us. It's an honor. We have a lot to talk about having to do with trade, having to do with our military. You're ordering planes, lots of planes. The United States has a very large deficit, as usual, with Italy -- about $31 billion. And I'm sure we'll straighten that out pretty quickly.

Donald Trump: But we find it a great honor to have you with us. Thank you. Thank you, Giuseppe.

Giuseppe Conte: Thank you. It's a big honor for me, of course. And thank you for this kind invitation, for your warm hospitality.

Donald Trump: You'll always be treated warmly. Okay? Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you.
