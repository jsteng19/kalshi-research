Note: The pool feed provided was extremely noisy. There appear to be brief remarks exchanged at 0:00 - 1:10, and Trump asks a question at 2:30 and converses for 40 seconds. An exchange also happens at 4:40 - 5:30. However, neither human nor robot could make out more than brief words.

Note: We apologize for our inability to accurately transcribe what was spoken in these exchanges.
