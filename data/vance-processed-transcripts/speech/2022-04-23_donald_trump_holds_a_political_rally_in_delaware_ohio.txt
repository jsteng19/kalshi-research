Thank you, sir. Ohio, do we love this guy? Whoo. Ladies and gentlemen, all I'll say is it is time to send Republicans who know what time it is. We've got Big Tech-censoring conservatives. We've got a crazy fake president who will buy energy from Putin and the scumbags of Venezuela but won't buy it from middle-class Ohioans.

We've got a ridiculous leadership, even on the Republican side, that tries to undo some of the best things that Donald Trump did over the past four years, things that no other president has done. It is time to send people who know what time it is, ladies and gentlemen. That's why I'm running for Senate, and that's why we're going to win and take this state back.

Now, the president is right. I wasn't always nice, but the simple fact is he's the best president of my lifetime. And he revealed the corruption in this country like nobody else. I'll give it back to you.

Now, ladies and gentlemen, let me introduce again the Republican who knows what time it is, the best president of my lifetime, the great Donald J. Trump.
