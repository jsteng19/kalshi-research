Isn't it great to have the president back in Ohio? Sir, thank you for being here. Look, the stakes are simple. The president said it well. We got to get out there and run up the score on these guys because we need to win and we need to win big and take our country back. That's exactly what we're going to do.

The simple thing here is we need senators who are fighters and senators who are doers. No more talking about big tech. No more talking about the border. We need people who are going to fight for the issues and actually get something done for the people of Ohio. That's what I'm going to do. Let's get out to the polls tomorrow.

Thank you all.
