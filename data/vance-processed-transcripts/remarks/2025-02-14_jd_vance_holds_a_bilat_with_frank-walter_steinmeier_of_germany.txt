I guess we'll restart here. We're already in the middle of a gripping conversation. We'll try to repeat it for the sake of media. So -- so, first of all, I want to thank the president and his staff for making time for us. Obviously, Germany is a great ally of the United States, and we're going to talk a lot about our economic and security cooperation.

I want to, given the attacks yesterday, to offer my condolences from -- from my wife and I. Munich is a beautiful city that we've actually visited before, both on work but also on vacation. So, very sad for what's happened and wish everybody the best to recover and try to care for the victims and their families.

And we'll have, I think, a good conversation about how to move the relationship forward and -- and cooperate on some -- some areas of shared interest. As you all know, uh, one of the things that the president and I really believe is that Europe is, of course, a very important ally for the United States. We also think it's really important to recognize that in the future we think Europe is going to have to take a bigger role in its own security.

And obviously, Germany being the biggest economy in Europe, is going to have a major role to play there, and so I'm sure we'll talk about that, as well. Mr. President, thank you and good to see you.

Sure.

Of course. Great, well, thank you, all, and, uh, now we'll hit the private conversation so you guys have to leave, but it's good to see everybody.

Well, let's see. Take care, guys.
