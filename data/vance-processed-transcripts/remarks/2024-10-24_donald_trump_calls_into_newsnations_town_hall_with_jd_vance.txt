Oh, no.

Well, first of all, sir, this is supposed to be undecided voters. I would hope that I have your vote of all people, but I -- here -- here's -- first of all, sir, of course, you're very brilliant, and we -- we both agree -- we both agree that it's important to have very smart people running our government.

But here's -- here's the thing about President Trump that --

A side of you, sir, if you'll forgive me for -- for telling this story, that I think often people don't see. And, of course, I got my beautiful wife here in the front row. And one of my favorite moments with President Trump is we were hosting an event for him near our home in Cincinnati a few months ago.

And, of course, you know, my wife is a little bit nervous to really, you know, talk to the -- the president of the United States. And he asked her, "What do you think about your husband being in public service?" And she gives -- if you know my wife -- a very diplomatic answer. "You know, sir, he really cares about the people of Ohio. He's thrilled to be able to serve them. And I'm happy to support him however I can."

And President Trump chuckles and goes, "Yeah, my wife hates it, too." And -- and the thing that it did is it just immediately broke the barrier. And it wasn't the former president. It was just a person talking to my wife. And I think you guys were able to have a nice conversation. But that ability to relate to anybody in any environment, I think that's the true brilliance of Donald J. Trump.

Oh, that's a very tough one, sir. I'm -- I'm supposed to say --

Something.

Take care, man. Mr. President, thank you.  Well --

No, man. We're pro-First Amendment. We're the only candidate that -- the candidates that are pro-First Amendment in this race.
