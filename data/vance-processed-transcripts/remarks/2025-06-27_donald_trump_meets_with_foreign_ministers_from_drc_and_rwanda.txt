Great. Well, first, let me welcome the foreign ministers of Rwanda and Congo. It's great to have you in the Oval Office. And second, let me say congratulations to the president, Secretary Rubio, the entire team. I think for the people of these two countries, they should know that the United States is committed to the pathway of peace.

But to my fellow Americans, this is really a celebratory moment. This is a big moment for our country, because under the president's leadership we've taken what was 30 years of killing and war, the worst war in terms of death count since World War II, and now we're on a pathway to peace. And so if I think about what I know about these two countries for 30 years, pretty much the entire time that I can remember, these two countries being in the news, much of the story has been about them fighting one another, about them killing one another.

And now we can look forward to a future where my children will look at this moment as the beginning of a new story, a story of prosperity and of peace. So thanks to the president. Congratulations to the entire team. And to my fellow Americans, we should all be really proud because it's amazing what active presidential leadership can accomplish when it's geared towards peace and prosperity, and that's what we have in the Oval Office right now.

So great job, sir.
