Great. Well, hello, everybody. Um, we're happy to host, uh, the UK delegation, uh, led of course by Foreign Secretary David Lammy, who I've known for a little while here. And obviously we have a lot in common. The special relationship between the United Kingdom and the United States will remain very strong.

Uh, we're going to talk about something that -- that he and I spoke about a couple of years ago when we met, which is our shared belief that Europe really should take a bigger role in its own security. And I'm glad the Foreign Secretary agrees with me on that. I think there are a lot of other issues of common agreement.

I'm sure we'll talk about Russia, Ukraine, as well, but Mr. Foreign Secretary, it's good to see you. Welcome. Thank you.

That's right.

Wonderful. Well, we're looking forward to it. Thank you, all. Good to see you.

Take care, guys.
