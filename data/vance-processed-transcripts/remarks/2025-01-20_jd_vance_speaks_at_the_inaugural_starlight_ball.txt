Well, thank you all so much for being here. And was that a hell of a speech or what? That was -- man, that was a good way to start it off. You know, I didn't know exactly what the president would put in that speech, and I hope to myself that he wasn't going to hold back, and, sir, you didn't hold back.

That was a hell of a way to start the next four years. But I just want to say, from the bottom of my heart -- and I know I speak for the president and for all of us. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for making this possible. We love you. We wouldn't be here without you, and we're going to make America great again together for the next four years.

And the last -- the last thing I'll say is, you know, having stood outside for about five minutes to wave goodbye to the Bidens, thank God, we moved that thing indoors because it was a beautiful ceremony. It was cold as hell outside. So, sir, the 45th and 47th President of the United States, Donald J. Trump.
