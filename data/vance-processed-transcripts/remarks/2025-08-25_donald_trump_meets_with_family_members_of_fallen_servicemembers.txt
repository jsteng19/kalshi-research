Oh, sir, I just echo what you said. We're so honored to have all of you here. I know that, uh, days like today can't make the hurt go away, but hopefully four years on we can start to, uh, remember with fondness and with a little bit of joy, the people that were taken from us. We're so proud of you. We're so proud of your loved ones for giving their life for our country.

And I think importantly today, this is a rectification of a wrong. The fact that the President of the United States lost your loved ones through incompetence, but never acknowledged it. And your government never actually put pen to paper to say, "We're grateful for your sacrifice." We correct that wrong today, and we're gonna keep on fighting to understand, as Pete said, what happened so it never happens to another family again.

But God love you all. God bless you. We're so thrilled to have you here in the people's Oval Office.

No, no they did not.

Sir.
