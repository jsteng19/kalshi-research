They gave me the hardest question, sir. I mean, look, as the president said, we're not going to do the negotiation in public with the American media. He's going to do it in private with the President of -- of Russia, with the President of Ukraine, and with other leaders. And I think that's how this has to go. I think the -- I just want to push back against some of the criticism I've seen of the administration on this because every single time the president engages in diplomacy, you guys preemptively accuse him of conceding to Russia.

He hasn't conceded anything to anyone. He's doing the job of a diplomat and he is of course the diplomat in chief, as the President of United States.

Well, said, sir .

Sir, they want you to negotiate with them instead of President Putin .
