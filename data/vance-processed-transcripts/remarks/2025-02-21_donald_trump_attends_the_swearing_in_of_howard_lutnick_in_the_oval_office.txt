So now we get to swear Howard in. Now where -- we need the actual --

Sign the commission first. Okay, Mr. President? We're going to sign the commission first.  I can't swear him in I guess until you sign the commission. Yes, sir.

All right, now, Howard, come -- come next to your beautiful wife and your beautiful family here. Put your hand on the Bible. Raise your right hand and repeat after me. I, Howard Lutnick.

Do solemnly swear.

That I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States.

Against all enemies, foreign and domestic.

That I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same.

That I take this obligation freely.

Without any mental reservation.

Or purpose of evasion.

And that I will well and faithfully discharge.

The duties of the office on which I'm about to enter.

So help you God.

Congratulations, Mr. Secretary.
