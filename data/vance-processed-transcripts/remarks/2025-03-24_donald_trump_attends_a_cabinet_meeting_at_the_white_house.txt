Yes. Sure. Yes, sir. Just on that topic, if you think about what happened with the Abraham Accords, one of the great diplomatic breakthroughs under the first Trump administration really in the last 30 or 40 years of American history in the Middle East, and the Biden administration did absolutely nothing with it. Built on it, not add at all, added zero additional countries.

Purely out of political spite, the Biden administration, I think, hurt the United States and really hurt the project of world peace. That has changed. Luckily, about two months ago, we got a new president, and that president has given us the task of building out the Abraham Accords, adding new countries to it. And really, what you see is a lot of these -- these -- these countries that have historical, ethnic, or religious hatreds want to build.

They want to build new artificial intelligence. They want to build new real estate projects. They want their citizens to become rich and prosperous and peaceful. And they're setting to the side some of those old hatreds under the leadership of President Trump. So, it's early, but we made a lot of progress, and we'll keep on making progress, sir.
