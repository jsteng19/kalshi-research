I, James David Vance, do solemnly swear.

That I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States.

Against all enemies, foreign and domestic.

That I will bear true faith.

And allegiance to the same.

That I take this obligation freely.

Without any mental reservation.

Or purpose of evasion.

And that I will well and faithfully discharge.

The duties of the office.

On which I'm about to enter.

So help me God.
