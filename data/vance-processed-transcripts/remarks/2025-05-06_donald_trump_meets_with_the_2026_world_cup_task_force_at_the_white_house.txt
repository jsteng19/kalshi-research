Well, thank you, Mr. President, and thanks to this incredible group that we've assembled. I'm proud to be the vice chair of this for a couple of reasons. First of all, the last time the president had me around a national or international sports trophy was the College Football Playoff National Championship and I almost broke it. And so, I appreciate the president giving me a second chance here.

But as all of you know, soccer is a sport of incredible grace and finesse and beauty. These are three things that have nothing to do with politics. And so, we're thrilled to have the FIFA World Cup in the United States of America. I think that you'll see the very best of the United States of America, both in athletic competition, but also in hospitality, something our boss knows quite a bit about.

And so, we're excited to have you. We're excited for this event and we will do everything at the government level to make this thing as successful as we can. And I will say to -- before I turn it over to the next speaker, that of course everybody is welcome to come and see this incredible event. I know we'll have visitors probably from close to 100 countries.

We want them to come. We want them to celebrate. We want them to watch the game. But when the time is up, they'll have to go home. Otherwise, they'll have to talk to Secretary Noem, who I'll turn it over to now.
