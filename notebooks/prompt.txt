I am looking to research how I could predict the odds of Trump mentioning different words and phrases during his upcoming March 2025 State of the Union speech. The end goal is to be able to estimate probabilities for the occurences of different words so I can bet on the Kalshi prediction market for what Trump mentions. I need to explore different approaches. What I've done so far: Pull his 4 previous SOTU addresses, and speech transcripts since September 2023. This amounts to 164 speeches. I plotted the average phrase frequency over time, looked at occurrences in the past 4 SOTUs, and used the Poisson distribution to naively calculate the chance of n or more occurrences given that the speech length will be the average of Trump's last 4 SOTUs. There are also some phrases  which require more than 1 occurrence for the betting market to resolve yes(e.g. America 15+ times). I calculated the probability of these occurring as well. I also divided the dataset into pre and post inauguration. I analysed the per-speech occurrences as well as the per 1000 word frequency.
