https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AbFXuGDRTs,World's Most Expensive Bunkers!,1037,20250830,En,"Hidden in this mountain is
a $1 billion nuclear bunker.
We are 2,000 feet underground
inside of a mountain,
and it can survive the biggest
atomic bombs ever made.
And I'm gonna show you the difference
between this $50 million nuclear bunker,
this $30 million bunker,
and everything in between.
Starting with this $1 bunker.
Feels safe.
Let's see what's inside.
Oh, it's wet.
I'm gonna give you guys
a tour of this bunker.
The tour's over.
It's basically a shipping container
buried underground
And already bending.
Which would explain
why they sold it to me for $1.
I mean, it looks like it's already
after the explosion.
Do you think this bunker
would survive a bomb?
- No.
- Let's find out.
Drop the bomb!
Wait. What?
The bunkers get crazier as we go,
let’s head to the next one.
Next is the $1 million bunker.
It was originally built to shoot missiles,
survive a nuclear apocalypse
far underground.
But how do you even
get inside it?
Well, after descending countless stairs
and opening a 7,000 pound door…
Why is 7,000 pounds
so heavy?
you reach the heart
of the bunker.
Oh my God.
This kind of looks
like Star Wars.
This room is where they would
launch the missile from.
This whole facility is designed to
withstand a nuclear attack
and then respond.
The floor we're standing on
is actually suspended
like a giant platform hanging
from the ceiling above.
These 8 springs are the only thing
holding all of us up right now.
It's crazy to believe that
50 years ago,
this used to be like
a missile command center.
But now this man has turned it into
a hidden, fortified house
that's ready for
the end of the world.
How did the government
let you buy this?
Dude there’s a bath tub!
How's the IQ of my friends
compared to your normal guests?
Um… I think it's lower.
We're gonna go 2 floors down.
This is the lowest point.
We are now 5 stories underground.
So kitchen, entertainment area,
but the best part about this?
This is a club.
This guy actually throws parties
5 stories underground
that Nolan is probably
not invited to.
So I don't normally
show people this.
Like, no one
sees this.
But he actually took us to
a secret part of the bunker,
to the nuclear silo where decades ago,
a real nuclear missile was stored inside.
No. Jimmy, come in here.
Whoa, wait.
What is this?
- Is that safe over there?
- Uh, no.
Wait, no Karl.
He said it's not s--
How bad would it be
if we turned the lights off?
I mean, I actually
don't know how we--
- Oh, dude.
- This is really scary.
I can't even see anything.
What's crazy is we're just
getting started.
The bunkers later in this video
are insane.
They just keep getting bigger and
more and more expensive.
But if you were going to try
to build one yourself,
it might look like the one
in this backyard.
Secretly hidden beneath our feet
is a bunker worth $3 million.
Follow me to
this creepy shed.
Going into a bunker someone
built in their backyard.
This is crazy.
This is awesome.
In terms of security, you've got like
a meter of concrete above you.
Other than a safe house, it is kind of
a museum for my YouTube creations.
If you're wondering why
this bunker is worth $3 million,
it's because of this YouTuber's collection
of insane and dangerous weapons.
That's a backpack flamethrower.
This guy's like
a real life Tony Stark.
I mean, look at this wrist-mounted
rocket launcher.
It fires knives and
has a taser in it.
And a machine gun
with a chainsaw.
Oh my gosh,
this is crazy.
Don't break into
this bunker.
He did mention fire earlier, so…
- Oh, gosh. Wait.
- No way.
Bro, we're in a bunker!
You come here.
Ok.
Now you can--
Oh my gosh.
I don't know if
I feel safe with this. 
This is terrifying.
You're gonna burn
your bunker down.
Do you want a go?
Yes.
Oh my God.
This is insane.
This guy is crazy.
This would be the worst bunker
in the world to rob.
Well, it's not just this bunker.
There is another room.
Oh, what do you mean?
I think this guy really likes
digging holes.
He has like a literal underground
tunneling system.
Whoa, wait this one's bigger
than the other bunker.
And there's one invention in here that's
so dangerous we saved it for last.
Just in case.
I'm gonna go over here.
But first, Colin showed me a cannon
that turns anything into ammunition.
I mean, we’ve got bread rolls
at the moment.
Here it comes.
Ok, just do it.
I'm about to do it.
Get it over with!
- About to happen.
- I'm terrified!
Any second,
he’s gonna shoot it.
Just go.
This is awesome.
The whole toilet roll?
The whole point of a bunker
is to protect you.
But I can't say I felt safe
once Colin pulled this out.
This is my spinning belt of knives.
Don't get too close.
Oh my gosh.
Especially after
he started doing this.
Have you ever had
a knife fall off?
No.
Alright.
Turn it off.
You could do that without
having a spinning belt of knives.
Yeah, but this is so much better.
Now Jimmy,
check this out.
This is a freezer-wave,
the opposite to a microwave.
So we get some Feastables,
we shove that in there,
we've got this little thing.
He couldn't wait to show us how it worked
on some Feastables Cups.
Done. Nothing is what it seems.
Oh my gosh.
Frozen Feastables.
- That's cool. Right?
- Yeah. Well, literally.
But as safe as Colin feels
there's no chance it compares
to this island paradise,
$5 million presidential bunker.
Why does it smell
like cat pee?
It may not look like much,
but in 1961, it was
more than enough
for one of the United States'
most well known presidents, JFK.
Oh my gosh.
What?
You're telling me that JFK
only had this?
But yeah, now it's kind of a dump.
These are the presidential bathrooms.
You're telling me five mil.
But more impressive, we've got
a billion dollar bunker so secure
that it's the only place you could survive
a nuclear extinction.
This is not very big.
I hope JFK never sees this video
'cause he's going to be like pretty upset
at all the other cool bunkers.
I have a feeling he won't.
Now let's go from the bunker of the past
to the bunker of the future.
Welcome to the $30 million bunker.
This is a 15 story bunker.
It's basically an underground skyscraper,
and it's built for 75 people
to survive anything.
First of all, these are
armor plated steel doors.
The doors are 2 feet thick.
How many RPGs would it take
to blow through this door?
Probably 3.
And if that doesn't make you feel safe,
there's a sniper's nest on the roof,
24 hour security,
and Larry's favorite…
Guns.
Oh my gosh.
So you're ready for
an invasion!
We aren’t gonna let people
steal our food.
Can I hold one?
This bunker also has its own
indoor shooting range.
This is insane.
Maybe this is all overkill,
but if the world was really about to end,
who wouldn't wanna live here?
This bunker has a hospital,
an exam room,
a dentist office,
a pharmacy.
This is jail!
And 15 luxury apartments,
which we've actually seen before.
Dude, I remember.
Five years ago, we filmed a video
where we did 24 hours in this bunker.
We looked so different.
I was younger.
This apartment
15 floors underground
is nicer than most people's
not bunker apartments.
Washer dryer.
This is awesome.
And all the other amenities
on the other 14 floors.
Don't tell Chandler and them
'cause he might get jealous,
but I think we'll buy
one of these.
- Yo, Jimmy.
- Oh, what's up? Hey.
- I saw there's like another--
- Yo, can you go check out over there?
There’s enough rooms
for all of us to--
Can you guys check that?
I'll take this room, yeah?
Jimmy I'll take this room.
And if you're wondering
what they eat down here.
This is our grocery store.
You really want this to feel like
real life, this is crazy.
Y'all got bacon in a can?
What kind of bunker would be
if we didn’t have bacon?
In a can?
And if you don't want to try
bacon in a can.
This is the entrance to
the hydroponics.
Wow.
This is probably one of the most
important rooms in this bunker.
Instead of dirt, hydroponics use water
to grow a variety of plants
that would essentially produce
infinite food for the residents.
And finally, we made it to
what could be
the most protected pool
in the entire world.
Oh my gosh.
I'm gonna be honest, this bunker is
at least 20 times better
than every bunker
we visited so far.
It had a pool, infinite food, a gym,
and even an entire rock wall.
I don't know how it's gonna
get better than this,
but somehow there are
more expensive bunkers.
Let's go check 'em out.
And now the $50 million bunker
which is underneath this ordinary house
in this ordinary neighborhood.
But if you look
30 feet underground,
you'll find one of the most expensive
and most bizarre bunkers on the planet.
Let's go explore it.
Inside here,
it's just a normal house.
But there's a secret code
to open up the elevator.
Blur this because I'll get in
trouble if it shows it.
Ok. One, two, three…
And the elevator opens up.
Alright, you guys ready?
Now we're going
3 stories underground.
If you turn around,
you can literally see the--
You can see!
This is like all the stone and cement
we're going down.
That’s so cool.
This elevator takes forever.
Ok. And--
Oh my gosh.
How’d they fit all that
in here?
This is crazy.
This $50 million bunker is designed
to look like you're not in a bunker.
Dude, hey,
feel this carpet.
Is this carpet or grass?
I don't know,
but it feels great.
If you're forced to be trapped
in a bunker for 100 years
this is probably the bunker
you would choose
because it doesn't
feel like one.
It looks like you're outside.
They got palm trees
3 stories underground.
They have a Christmas tree.
Even though Christmas was
9 months ago.
I guess they just
leave it up all year.
Let's kick this bunker tour off
by exploring the house
that is in a bunker
underneath.
Watch out!
Oh my God.
The guy who built this bunker
is like 5 feet tall.
Wait, Tareq,
walk under it.
I'm good.
No, that's not a flex.
You're short!
Oh my God.
What is this place?
Whoa! This is huge.
This is way bigger than
I thought it would be.
This is so fancy.
It does not feel like
you're in a bunker.
No, I feel like
I'm in a normal house.
Obviously, this bunker was
designed in a way
where if you had to live down here
for decades,
you wouldn't miss the outside world
because it feels like the outside world.
Bro it literally looks like you're outside
with the trees in the window.
Surely if you're own a $50 million bunker,
you wouldn't care if I took a Diet Coke.
Wait how old is this?
Oh, God. Um…
Yo.
Yo, wait.
This expired 2 years ago.
It tasted so bad.
Hey, Google if I'm gonna die.
Yeah, I'm not getting anything.
Yeah, it's 'cause we’re
3 stories underground.
- Whoa!
- Yeah.
Where is this?
Bro.
Yeah, this is it.
This is the room.
Wait, is this the video where we trapped
Hugo and Rayne in a bunker for 100 days
to win $500,000?
What do you guys think
of Hugo and Rayne?
- They always fight.
- I like ‘em.
What if I told you…
that was a signal for them
to come down the elevator,
and they're probably gonna be mad
this bunker's way nicer
than the one
I put 'em, in.
What the heck?
Welcome to the $50 million bunker!
- Hey, guys.
- What the--
What do you think?
This is a bunker?
This is nicer than the bunker
I built you guys.
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.
And don't drink the diet Coke,
it expired 2 years ago.
Have fun!
Yes!
Don't fight.
Don't disrespect me like that!
You’re so stupid.
We won't fight.
We're watching your bunker video
in a bunker,
in a house in the bunker
below another house.
How does that make you feel?
What did you just say?
Don't worry about it.
Let's keep going.
It didn't take long for Hugo and Rayne
to fall back into old habits.
It's all pink!
Hugo, I promise, if this was
our kitchen in the bunker,
I would have cooked
for you every night!
It is nice, but I still don't think
you woulda cooked.
No-- Oh my God.
Outside this house is a pool!
We're still in a bunker,
keep in mind.
Hugo!
Oh! He just jumped in
with socks on.
So far, my only critique
of this bunker:
The pool can use some heat.
It’s pretty cold.
How different would your challenge
have been if you guys had a pool?
- Very different.
- I don’t think I would've left.
And to make this bunker even better….
You guys loved our
peanut butter cups so much
that we decided to make
an alternative version with hazelnut.
They're only available for a limited time
at these select retailers,
so go try some
before they're gone.
And if you haven't already,
try our peanut butter cups
and tell us which
you like more.
They taste amazing.
And obviously, it wouldn't be
a hidden bunker
without its own secret escape route.
That's the secret exit.
Not sure if I'm supposed to show it.
And that brings us to last,
but not least,
the $1 billion dollar bunker,
the most secure bunker on the planet!
The Cheyenne Mountain Space Force Station.
This bunker is shielded by over
2,000 feet of solid granite rock,
and can literally withstand
the most destructive weapons
ever devised by mankind.
What happens if we run down this tunnel?
Don't ask him.
They'll shoot you.
Oh. I won't run down
the tunnel then.
Alright, let's do this.
Now, usually this is where
we'd have a fancy 3D map
showing just exactly how
this bunker is laid out.
However, this place is so secretive
and secure…
I need you to put a lens cap
on this camera.
I legally cannot show anything
like that from here on out.
And if somehow,
you make it past the guards…
Can I hold your gun?
Or no?
- No, you cannot.
- Ok, alright.
Karl-- don't ask that.
Wait, can I hold it?
You'll reach this massive
nuclear bomb-proof door.
Durable enough to protect you
from the biggest and
deadliest bombs ever created.
Whoa! Wait, there's 2?
And if all of that somehow wasn't enough,
there's a second one
right on the other side.
If someone blew up a nuke out there,
and we were here…
We would be good.
So this is what we call
the welcome wall.
This is going in
to the compound now.
Does that say Space Force?
It does. You have Space Force here.
These are the 4 commands that operate
outside of this bunker.
And to ensure complete safety for
these elite world leaders,
this bunker’s also designed to survive
something far less predictable
than any enemy threat:
mother nature.
And it does so
by literally floating.
They carved out a gap between
the mountain and the bunker,
and then put the bunker
on springs
so the shockwave of a nuclear attack or
even an earthquake is completely absorbed.
Welcome to the most secure bunker
on the planet.
Alright.
We've gone through massive blast doors,
walked for an eternity…
I can't even tell you how far
because it's classified
to get here, the most secure place
on the planet.
Let's see what's inside.
And now, we are at the what?
The battle deck.
Am I allowed to show all this?
Everything except for
what's on the right.
That's definitely not a UFO.
But to protect North America from
an airborne or maritime attack,
this is where the leaders of NORAD
would be calling the shots.
This is where
our General sits.
Oh, this felt like
the General seat.
- Can I sit in the General seat?
- Absolutely. Go ahead.
Just don't touch anything!
Uh, I touched the chair.
Is that fine?
- That's it.
- Ok.
I'm the General now!
Tareq, ready the systems.
Yeah… sure.
No!
Did you actually
touch something?
You're not supposed to touch it!
- Don't touch anything.
- I didn't--
Tareq, they've only told us like 30 times
not to touch anything.
We gotta make sure
for real.
Dude! He’s gonna
get arrested!
Oh my God, I'm so sorry.
I am actually so sorry.
Tareq might have literally just
got us kicked out.
Don't touch it again.
- Ok. I'm so sorry.
- Please don't do that.
I'm so, so sorry.
Tareq, these buttons could launch
missiles for all you know.
What's on the other side
of those windows?
You wanna clap?
No way. Really?
I just clap?
Yup.
- Yo!
- Stop it!
Eric showed us the secret command post
at the heart of the bunker.
Alright, where am I?
You're in the AJOC.
Alternate Joint Operation Center.
And it's responsible for protecting
the air and sea
of the entire North American continent.
With an unknown aircraft, how many minutes
until fighter jets are tailing them?
Less than 5 minutes.
Then we're getting into
some dangerous territory.
I can read between the lines.
And because they're monitoring
every potential threat,
you know I had to ask…
Any UFOs?
Uh, possibly?
You can't answer?
He’s lookin' at the ground.
Oh, nevermind.
- Different subject.
- Cut it there!
So, I finally got permission
to film a hallway.
Take it all in!
Now I need you to put
the lens cap back on, Jimmy.
Really?
Alright, I'll see you guys
in the next room.
While the number of people that
work here is classified,
I can tell you it has everything needed
to keep hundreds of people alive
for years at a time,
including a gym,
a grocery store…
Wait, so many people work in this bunker
that you opened a Subway?
Correct.
I'm about to have the most secure
meatball marinara I've ever had.
It also has its own fire station.
Yes, with fire trucks that drive on
actual roads inside this mountain.
Alright, hold up.
Oh, let's not run with that.
- No running with that.
- Alright. I got you.
They usually practice on dummies,
but we brought one of our own.
They better save me.
- He's unconscious!
- Slap him in the face!
- Get him up!
- Wake up!
Sorry.
- Lift me up!
- Hurry!
Sir, how would you say we did?
Uh, probably a 4/10.
That's 'cause we didn't
do enough CPR! More!
Wait! I'm good!
Some bunkers hide in backyards.
And with enough money,
hide under entire neighborhoods.
Others go beyond survival
and are so luxurious
that they have their own water park.
But none compare to this:
an underground city
with its own power grid,
endless hallways, highways,
and multiple lakes.
This bunker one day could be what
defends North America and humanity.
One last thing I need you to do.
Cover the camera.
Before I do,
could you say the U.S. military will hunt
them down if they don't subscribe?
Absolutely not.
Ok, I tried.
Thanks for coming out."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDv56whosPQ&t=842s,"Survive 100 Days In Prison, Win $500,000",1775,20250816,en,"I built this maximum
security prison, and if this cop and this criminal
survive 100 days together, I will give them
half a million dollars. - What's going on?
- Nice to officially meet you. - Nice to meet you. Lenny.
- Ian. You guys want to be
uncuffed? That'd be great. Now that that's
out the way… At any point over the next 100 days, if either of you decide to leave,
you’ll both get nothing. Have you guys ever seen
$500,000 in real life? Never. Well, I owed a half a million
when I got out of prison. Does that count? How long were
you a cop? 17 years. How long were you a… …criminal? 3 years in
federal prison. How do these compare
to the prison you were in? These are a little thicker.
And we have a pillow. You didn't get a pillow
when you're in prison? They don't give you
a pillow. Well aside from the pillow,
this prison is a 1:1 replica of what an actual prison
would be like. Dude, he's got
the real prison toilet. Wow. We’re gonna feed you guys
3 times a day, we’re gonna cut the lights off
at the same time every night, and we’re gonna give you
a wake-up call every morning. Good luck. They really made this like prison. These seats are cold. - Uncomfortable!
- Cold. Hard. As always, we have a ton of cameras
monitoring their every move. They're listening to everything
that we're saying, so anything that
we say… They're gonna get ideas. Today was the first time that this
cop and this criminal have ever met. And we didn't know it yet,
but over the course of this video, Ian and Lenny quickly
became enemies. There's gonna be stealing… I'm now the smuggling convict. Fights… So because I'm not religious,
it's an issue. Whoa, I didn’t say that. We're gonna need
an EMT! And even betrayal. You’re Lenny, the snitch. This is brutal. Will they make it the entire 100 days
or will one of them screw the other? All I want to do is go home
with all the money, and if I have to strangle a cop,
so be it. - Dibs on bottom bunk.
- Nah, I'm taking the bottom bunk. Whatever, old man. In prison, it goes by
the elder respect. So whoever's older
gets to decide first. What if he snores
at night? I do. Good night. Hey, what about a warning? All right, criminal.
Get some rest. Good morning. It is way too early. The stupid cop
was snoring all night. Your snoring kept me up. - It did?
- Yeah. So I think it's like,
judging by the sky, like maybe 6 or 7 a.m.
right now? The first night. Jimmy, I gotta say,
that really did feel like prison. The most important question:
What were you locked up for? Fraud and
money laundering. So I start lying, borrowing money
from this person to pay this person, lost everyone's money. But the problem became
I lied about the losses. So I ended up with
$500,000 of debt… Which coincidentally is
the same amount of money they could win
in this video. Meal time. Guys, we got our first meal
in prison right here. This actually looks
better than prison. Ian the criminal seems to be
right at home here. It's actually pretty cozy
down here. While Lenny the cop is fighting
to adapt to prison life. I've locked people up
my whole life, so it's weird to be
on the other end of it. Them telling me what time
I gotta go to sleep, what time I’m gonna be waking up,
and what time I'm going to be eating. Like, that’s a wild, crazy
adjustment for me. Good morning. Ian and Lenny’s relationship was off
to a bit of a rocky start. I think I might sleep
on the floor for the snoring. Bro, it’s so annoying. I have officially
moved my bed, and hopefully it will deflect
Mr. Lenny's snoring. Even with the tension between them
and Ian's lack of sleep, the cop and criminal had to do
something to cure their boredom. They worked together to create a
basketball hoop with their bed frame… This is a dope idea. And even utilized it
as a pull up bar. I was not athletic
my first prison go around, so I'm making it up
my second one. There we go. It was clear that they wanted
some workout equipment. I'm tryna turn a jail body
into a beach body. And as usual, I had something
for them on day 10 that might help
them out. Officer Beast reporting. Officer Beast reporting for duty! Let's see how our prisoners
are doing. How's it going, boys? Warden Jimmy! I see you dismantled
the bed here. Well, I'm living
with Snorlax over here. Snorlax?
What, you snore? Apparently,
but I don't believe it. What do you think
the day 10 offer is? - Personal chef, a library…
- A book. What if it was none
of the above? Follow me, boys. This locked door is the first
of many restricted areas that I will reveal throughout
the course of this video. Guards! Unlock the door. East wing unlocked. Right this way. Welcome to
the prison yard! Out here, you'll have
everything you need to stay fit for
the next 90 days. Let's go. For 1 hour a day you'll have access
to a pull-up bar, a basketball goal. Just soak it in. This would make time go by
so much faster. Oh, it feels great
seeing the sun. Are you ready
to hear the offer? - Yes, we are.
- Yes. Alright, come on in. Unlock the interrogation room. Area unlocked. Alright, come on in.
Have a seat. Alright. Now that you're in
separate rooms with no ability to communicate
with each other, the day 10 offer is… If you guys want
the recreational area, it's gonna cost you $50,000
of your prize pool. If you both accept it,
it's yours for 50 grand. But where this gets
interesting is if one of you accept it
and the other doesn’t, you still pay the 50 grand
for the prize pool, but only one of you gets access to it
for the rest of the video. This is not what
I was expecting. You've had 10 days in this prison
to get to know each other, but can you predict what
the other person will choose? Oh, my goodness… It's a big decision because
this affects the next 90 days. I'm tired of lookin’ like
the bad guy in life. You know what
the good guy would do, but being the good guy
for 90 days kinda sucks. I wanna cry. Alright, you've both
made your decisions. They have no idea what
each other chose. Want to kick us off? I said yes. I haven't told him what you chose yet. I said yes. My view on the money aspect
has changed drastically. I'm willing to spend money
to live more comfortably, to get through
this time here. Who knows? You might not
make it to the end if we pass up the things that could
make our situation more comfortable. Some money is better
than no money. That's the way that
I see it. Good morning. Good morning. It was crazy to see that
an hour a day of recreation time made them feel like they could
stay here for 100 days. Wow. Freedom, baby. Definitely worth the 50K. 50 grand well spent. Over the next
couple of days, they took full advantage
of everything the yard had to offer. Gonna come out of here
looking like savages. For now, it seemed like
the rec yard allowed them to tolerate each other
enough to survive. But there were some things
about this challenge that they didn't handle
so well… because I built this set to be
just like a real prison. And we all know
prison food is not that good. This is Warden Jimmy’s version
of meatloaf. Like a frozen burger, probably
defrosted with some gravy on it. This food is absolute
butt cheeks. I had no idea the people
I arrested were eating this. I really don't know how much
longer I can eat this. I would not wish this upon my worst
enemy, what's goin’ on right now. And that's why, on day 20,
I had the perfect thing for them. Are you ready
for the day 20 offer? - Yes. Let's go.
- Yes. One of you is gonna have to make
the decision for both of you. Which one of you wants
to make the decision that both of you
will have to live with? Alright, I'll just let you
rock with it. Ok. Oh, really?
You trust him that much? - Course he does.
- Yeah. We talk a lot. Ok. Let's go. Kitchen unlocked. Come on in. Wow. There's a kitchen
in here? In this kitchen is all
the ingredients and cooking equipment you'll need to cook
delicious and healthy meals for the rest of your time
in this prison. You can continue eating
the prison meals which you don't like or take this kitchen
and eat whatever you want for breakfast, lunch,
and dinner every single day. You just have to give up
your yard time every day. Do you know what the offer is? It's trade the rec yard
for a kitchen. Me personally, I would rather
have the food. Could have fun cooking
throughout the day. We can make creations. Do we have any meat? Do we have any meat?
What do ya think? We got some beef patties,
some hot dogs. Everything you could want. Ok, ok. But here's the thing:
You're not just deciding for you. What do you think
your partner would think? Aw man, I don’t know what
he’d want me to do. Well, I'll give you
a minute to choose. Ian, I gave your roommate
the choice to trade the recreation yard for
a fully-stocked kitchen. I already know what he picked.
He picked keep the yard time. Yeah, he didn't even
consider my offer. Guys, every single day
you complain about the food, I thought you were
gonna take it! You know what? That was a little easier
than I thought. Day 30, I’m gonna make it
not so easy on you guys. Alright. Bye, Warden Jimmy. Not giving up this rec yard
for nothing. Another day in paradise. It's been a full 24 hours since
my bunkie and I made the decision to turn down
the kitchen. We're not feeling
the least bit of regret. - You feeling any regret over there?
- None. We're so happy we're not
cooped up all day. I can't wait to see
my wife's reaction. She's gonna be like, ain't no way that you didn't take
that basketball court. No way you didn't take
being outside. Despite being happy with
the results of their challenge, they were also beginning to think
about what they were missing outside of
the prison. What I have to remember is
why I'm here and what my purpose is. Winning that money for my family
is the ultimate goal. I got my wife.
I have a beautiful family. I can't back out of this because
everybody else is depending on me. It must be nice having
a wife and kids. Yeah, I did a year
without my family. I mean… I saw my dad once in that year
for two days. Once? But I didn't see my brother
or my mom for a year. Really? That's that. Limited to an hour of
yard time a day… Can't wait for yard time. … they grew restless and found
creative ways to pass the time before the next
challenge. Ketchup Dodgeball! Get outta here, copper! We’re gonna need an EMT. Wrap me up!
Officer, am I gonna lose it? I‘m losing breath! Our inmates have now been living
in this prison for 30 days. Let's see how they're doing.
What up, boys? - Hey!
- Hey, Warden Jimmy! Guys, you're a month into it.
How's it been? It's been good. Come on inside, fellas. There's a new area of the prison
that we're going to unlock right now. Unlock the library door. You gotta be kidding. Library unlocked. Are you serious? Seriously! And there are literally
hundreds of books in here. We got magazines. Wait, hold up. Here's the catch. Access to this library is 100% free,
but only one of you gets it. - For the next 70 days…
- You gotta be kiddin’ me. …one of you will get to go in here
for an hour and read. The other will not. Oh, for an hour every day? And you can't bring
the books out? Cannot bring the books out.
That is strictly forbidden. What else is included
in there? Alright, we'll do a tour. You have lots of
books in here. They got a Bible.
Look at this. This right here will get me through.
This the only book that I need. What's the computer about? You gotta put that back. Leave it to him to try
to steal a book. This bad boy will play
Tetris and Minesweeper. Got some more books
over here. Oh man,
this is tough. It's disrespectful. I'm gonna need you guys
to step out. I'll give you guys a couple hours
to negotiate amongst each other. Good luck deciding. - Thanks, Jimmy.
- I'm not happy with this. You guys like reading
this much? Yeah, have you ever been
locked up? No, actually. We're dying in here. Ok. I'll be back in 2 hours
for your decision. One of us always has to suffer
in MrBeast’s prison. We got to talk it out just like
we do everything else. Hopefully it doesn't come down to
me putting him in a headlock. After I left, Ian and Lenny
kind of avoided each other… This sucks. …agonizing over
my offer. It is literally so close. I'm not asking for any other books.
I just want one. We have to come up with something.
We can't just do nothing. This library, I mean,
it's meant, obviously, to pit us against
each other. So what's on your mind?
You're the philosophical one. I think that we have no choice
but to take it. Because it's a freebie.
It's too good to pass up. The question is, though,
is who takes it? Right now, I'm shooting
hoops, and… I'm still pretty happy with
the decision that we made in regards to that, so… I’m gonna put the ball
in your court because you put the ball
in my court for the last one. Oh, sorry. Trying to kill me
out here, bruh… It seemed like a fair trade
to put the library decision on Ian. But there was one thought
that Lenny just couldn't shake. I should have my Bible. With all honesty… Why do you think that you
deserve the library more than me? Just like, what I need to help get me
to 100 days, you know? You possibly wanting to cop out
as a result is… I don't know. What makes you think
you deserve the library, then? The Bible is the only thing that'll
get me through the next 70 days. It's not just for
entertainment. So because I'm not religious,
it's an issue. Whoa, I didn't say that. I just feel like you're changing up
on me out of the blue for no reason
right now. Then we just go with
no books. If that's the way
it's gotta be, bro. Alright. It’s whatever, bro. It's just really making me
second guess. Honestly, this whole thing's
getting ridiculous. Too bad you don't have
a book to distract you. I think we're ready for
the warden at this point, guys. It looked like this cop and criminal
might have landed back at square one, but nonetheless,
their time was up. Alright, I'm ready for
your decision. Is it you or is it you
that is getting library time every day for
the next 70 days? Jimmy, the thing is… Looks like I'm gonna be getting
that library time. - You are?
- Yep. You're givin’ it to him?
I was a little concerned. It's been a hard last
couple hours. Why did you
give it to him? When it came down
to the yard… I said yes… Without hesitation.
He was cool losing 25,000. That's the only thing
that he's wanted. So I had to do him
the justice. You're lucky. He's a good man.
He's a good cop. I didn't expect that
from a cop. I was wrong. I feel like that was unnecessary.
He just gave you a library. Library unlocked. It was Ian's first day with access
to the new library. And right away,
he got to work to ensure that Lenny
wouldn't be left out. I believe this is what
he was looking for. I know how important
the Bible is to Lenny. So I'm writing down quotes from it
that I can share with him. Thank you, I appreciate it.
I gotta live through you. Vicariously through me,
you know. The fact that he’s sharing, it
shows that he's a good bunkie. But no later than
the very next morning did Ian begin to test
the limits. Found a little artwork
we can hang up somewhere. Said we can't bring books out,
but I'm just smugglin’ pages out. Wow, that's pretty cool. And over the next couple days,
it wasn't just Ian having all the fun. We got some artwork. And the prison
began to change. Makin’ this place look nice. And even with cameras
aimed at them all the time, Ian's inner criminal
finally surfaced. There was no way I was gonna
leave him out there struggling with no Bible,
no books, nothin’ to do. And I was in here
enjoying myself. This thing is a beauty.
That’s all I need while I’m in here. They carried on as if
they'd never be caught… Enjoying the materials. My new name's Smuggler Vic,
the Smuggling Convict. I literally have books hidden
everywhere. Here in the bathroom.
Look at that. In here. We're just gonna keep getting
as many books as possible. Hidden all over
this place. It's day 40. How's it going, guys? We have a surprise,
but we can only take one at a time. You guys have to decide
who goes first. Rock, paper,
scissors, shoot! He got me.
He goes. Store unlocked. We've opened
our very own shop. You're gonna have some
decisions to make. We combed through all of
the prisoners’ conversations and stocked this store full of items
that they wanted. And it ranges from this mystery box,
which could literally be anything, all the way down to this handball
that on the outside would cost $1. But in this prison, every single
thing here is the same price: 10,000. A handball for $10,000? But of course, they were only allowed
to spend the money that they were
competing for. - And I have to decide now?
- Yeah. I'm gonna take the… …mystery box. $10,000. Pleasure doing business with you. And while Lenny was happy with
just the mystery box, Ian's criminal spending habits
resurfaced. Oh, wow. This is actually
pretty cool. If I spend too much money,
Lenny’s gonna get really mad. I’m a little nervous here. This is 100% gonna be
my first purchase of the day. See, the thing is, at least
he knows what he's getting. I have no clue
what’s in there. This is a great package
for 10,000. Don't buy too much, Ian. I'd like the melatonin
and the clippers. We're gonna have some
fun in here, buddy! But how much
did you spend? 30,000, but we got
Feastables. And honestly,
I am so happy right now. I got clippers for us.
I got you the sleep mask. If I really needed those things,
I would’ve spent the 10K on them. Listen, I went to prison for
spending a lot of money, so… I couldn't resist! There was just
dollar signs everywhere. Do you wanna see what's
in the mystery box? 20 grand! Come on.
He's makin' money! I think now we have enough
to keep us busy to the point where we don't need
to spend anything else. And now that the boys had
some of the items they wanted, they were able to pass time
more easily. They made art with
the $10,000 colored pencils. These are my first of
the colored ones for the walls. Feastables, the best chocolate
in the world. So excited for this. - Oh, these things are legit good.
- That's my new favorite. You guys already know, Feastables is the best tasting
chocolate in the world. And we just launched our brand new
creamy hazelnut cups. Usually cups have peanut butter
inside of them, like our Feastables
Peanut Butter Cups, but when I was
testing prototypes, and I tried creamy hazelnut chocolate
filling inside of a cup, it was phenomenal. And so we launched
this product, and the reviews have been
out of this world. It's available at these retailers.
Go give it a try. Then they made paper airplanes
with $10,000 paper. Somebody come get
this guy. A new level of
boredom. Did they ever diagnose you
with ADHD? And Lenny gave Ian the most
expensive haircut of his life. Now the guards will finally
be afraid of me. And eventually, Lenny came to
appreciate what Ian bought for him. I gotta keep it real
with you. These earplugs and
the melatonin, they definitely come through
in the clutch. Really helps me get some
extra rest. - Thanks.
- You’re welcome, buddy. But they still wanted one thing
that they couldn't buy in a store. Tomorrow's day 50,
challenge day. Hoping it's family or
a phone call. Toughest part is being away
from my family. Would you spend money
on a phone call? Yeah, I’d spend money
on a phone call. So I have the perfect offer
for day 50. Boys!
It's day 50! Before I reveal the day 50 offer,
I need to show you two some clips. Let's do it. Here's you one day,
smuggling the books into your pants. Eventually, you started
caring so little that you literally
threw the books out. And then you just flat out walked
out of there with the books. Day 50 is a huge milestone. Your families are sitting outside
in a prison bus, and we were
going to celebrate it by bringing in both of
your families for free. But because you
broke the rules, only one of you gets to see your
families instead of both of you. And this will be the only time
you can see your family until the end of
the 100 days. Warden’s playing dirty. The only thing I think I've been very
consistent about seeing my family. So who is it
gonna be? My man’s gonna see
his family today. - Really?
- Appreciate that. How does that
make you feel? Well, I just see him honoring me,
just like I honored him. Looks like I'm gonna be
getting that library time. And he's kinda also the reason
why we're being punished. This man is working with
the cops right now. Are you kidding me? - Confiscate all the paraphernalia.
- Are you serious? Oh, and there's
one more twist. You can keep your family
as long as you want, but he doesn't leave solitary
until they leave. Ok. Wow, this is brutal. Chandler, take him to solitary. I'm happy, but I feel horrible
at the same time. Yeah. Just don't sneak
books out, man. I’m gonna keep sneaking
the books out, warden. Spoken like a true criminal.
Close the door. Have fun. Oh, man.
This is brutal. Come on inside.
Lenny’s waiting to see you guys. Hi, Dad! Hi, Dad! Lenny! Go see him! Daddy! Look, it's daddy! That's so freaking adorable. Oh, I miss you so much! Oh my gosh… What's it like seeing your dad
in orange instead of blue? - Very weird.
- Yes, he never wears that. Your family can stay in here
as long as you want. Just know your partner doesn't leave
solitary until they leave. Have fun, everybody! Thanks. You miss dadda, mama?
Ah, you miss dadda. I'm happy to have
my family here with me. Apparently, I can keep them here
as long as possible. It's definitely gonna be
a recharge for me as well, and makes me want to push through
to get on day 100. I want everybody in the family
to be proud of me, not just the people
that are here. We're all counting on you. I got you. Hearing Lenny and his family
out there just chilling and I'm stuck in here
locked up like a dog. Every minute
I'm standing in here, I just got more and more mad
that I'm sitting in the solitary. It gives you PTSD.
It sucks. Ian got some time
to think about things. But as the hours
went on, Lenny spending more time with
his family only made Ian more mad. Ian, your time is up. I'll tell you what. I figured out your nickname
while I was in there, though. Oh, yeah?
What you got? You’re Lenny the Snitch. He's kinda also the reason why
we're being punished. You rat me out on
my book supply, bro. Look at this.
I got wiped clean. You come out here laying down
the law, why’s that? I’m a little upset, bro!
I was stuck in there. You were having a good meal.
You know what I got? I got nothing, bro. You volunteered to do it,
so why complain? You threw me
right under the bus saying it was my idea
for the smuggling. Everything was on video! But I'm just saying you coulda just,
we could have stand united. You snitched me out— I didn't snitch you out. They did not know about
under the bed. Bro, they have
camera footage! And I went into
solitary confinement— They have camera footage! But it still didn’t go
under the bed. So do you want to
hear me talk or you just want to express
your feelings or— I’m just saying, I took
the major one for the team— All I'm saying is this:
Watch what you say. - That's all I'm saying.
- Ok. Well, you made your decisions.
I make my decisions. It is what it is,
you know? It is what it is. You snitched me out. Ian’s definitely feeling in
a bit more of a somber mood today. I got to see my family.
Ian didn’t. It's definitely changed
the atmosphere as a result of that. He didn't want to play any chess,
he didn't want to play basketball. Lenny and I have definitely been
talking a lot less. He has his routine,
I have my routine, and that's all there is
kinda really to it. Even with the divide, Lenny couldn't
help but worry about his friend. You alright, buddy? I'm depressed. What's the matter? I'm ready to go home.
I’ve had enough. Even though it was only halfway
through the challenge, Ian was ready
to call it quits. Oh, man. I can't wait
to go home. All I want to do
is go home. I'm just fed up. Lenny will have to find a way
to rekindle their friendship. Because they can leave at any point
and if Ian goes home, they both lose. Gentlemen! - Morning, Jimmy.
- Morning! I have good news for
the both of you. Our day 60 offer, something that will help
bring you back together. Hey, Chandler!
Bring it on in! Here we come. A TV. Look at this thing. I know this TV is old, but it's what you're getting
since you're in prison. And you can watch these movies on it
over the next 40 days. What, were you guys born in the 50s
with some of these movies? What, you don't want to
watch movies? And the board games
are included? Of course. You can have all this for 1 hour a
day for the measly price of $30,000. I think this man's
losing it. I don’t know,
it's kinda tempting. Ok. An hour a day? An hour a day for 40 hours
of entertainment. Jimmy, you can't even watch
a movie in an hour. You just watch an hour of a movie,
we take it away and then the next day you watch the other hour
of the movie. The movie selection…
not really my cup of tea. This is a terrible deal.
Hard no. No? No. Hey, I thought you guys were bored.
No worries. Chandler, wheel it on out. Ah… man. Hold up, Chandler.
Pat him down. I didn't do anything. Pat him down. Oh my gosh.
In the underwear!? And he's looking for sympathy after
the last time he broke the rules. Get it out of here before
he steals anymore. Bye TV, bye VCR,
bye Titanic! Ian was not happy
with the offers, which was making Lenny worried
that Ian would leave. I just feel like I'm getting
brutalized every 10 days now. No family, not even a phone call.
It's pretty miserable, honestly. I could definitely feel myself having
a bit more of a short fuse. It kinda gets annoying. There's always something
to complain about with this guy. I feel like I got hit by a bus
the second time. I do not wanna be here
anymore. I'm definitely starting to get
worried he's gonna quit. I wanna go home. I wanna go home,
he says… I'm just going to be thinking
about that dogging. He dogged me on
that last challenge. I got dogged, dogged, dogged,
dogged, dogged! Man, I wish this guy would
shut up already. But because I had my biggest offer
planned for day 80 I decided not to give them
anything on day 70 so they'd have to heal the divide
themselves. When you're actually
in this thing, when you're in the belly
of the beast, it's hard. It's been very depressing and
sad the last few weeks. All you can do is read,
work out, play chess. It's definitely mentally challenging. I just wanna go home. It’s one of those days, huh? Ian was saying how he feels like
he wants to go home. It's gonna be an uphill battle.
Just gotta keep this guy on board. Because either one of these contestants
can leave at any time, Lenny was continually worried that
Ian would leave early and lose them both all the money
they had worked for. - What time is it?
- Time for you to get a watch! I was gonna ask if you wanna play chess,
but I'll go back and have a seat. His name's Leonard,
aka the Snitching Convict. You've snitched on yourself. That guy cracks himself up. Yo, we got the Snitching Convict! You’re the real convict, not I. It became clear that Ian
wasn't gonna let certain things go. Here, there was only an option
for a visit once, and only Lenny got
the visit. Desperate to stay
in the challenge, Lenny knew he had to lift Ian's spirits
if they were gonna make it to the end. Life is good! No, just makes me miserable. But things only got worse. I don't think I would have any problem
walking outta here early. Being here with Ian and
feeling negative the whole time, I feel frustrated. If they give me an offer
to take less money, I'm gonna take that. - What to leave?
- Yeah, I'm out of here. At this point, with only
20 days left, it looked like they were about to fail,
so I had an idea. My next offer was an opportunity
to rekindle their friendship. Or, the final factor that could bring
this entire video to an end. Oh boy. Oh, what do we got here? What the— In front of you is
a 2,000 pound boulder. Inside of which is a key that will
unlock a box containing $100,000. If you want that money, you will have
1 hour a day for the next 10 days to break this rock open
and get the key. By accepting this risk, you give me
that $50,000 right now. But if you complete it,
I will give you $100,000. If you guys wanna have a shot
at pulling this off, you're going to have to
work together. I'll give you guys
some time to decide. We just gotta grind it out. You know Ian, I know
you don't like to sweep, but you're gonna have to
put in your work on this one. Are we both gonna be able to
whack at this thing? Bro, we gonna be good! You gotta— We just—
We’ll be fine. There's no way Lenny! Feel like this is
a highway robbery. Now, do you guys think you have what
it takes to take on this challenge? We got this. - Do we?
- Absolutely. Alright! You brought this
on yourselves. Boys, take the $50,000. Just be easy with it,
'cause we're gonna get that back soon. It's gone! Be easy with it. Inmates, your first hour
begins now. For the entire first hour,
they hammered the boulder nonstop. This is hard! I think we just lost 50,000. I hate it here! We have 9 hours left
to get through this rock. But despite their lack of progress, the next day they came outside
and got started right away. We gotta hustle ain’t got
no time to play. Every minute counts. There it is! And even though it was only
their second hour with the rock, Ian was already settling into
more of a hypeman role. Come on, Lenny! There we go,
there we go Lenny! Everything we got
on this Lenny! And Ian watched from the sidelines,
all the way through day 4. Oh, man. Very disappointing day. All I know is I'm spent. Yeah, I'm pretty fried. We have to work
as a team. I think Ian could tell
Lenny was disappointed. Because the next morning,
he had a pretty big shift in his mindset. Let's go!
Yeah boy! And when Lenny tapped out,
Ian stepped up. Let me try hammering it
so we can get that key. Now, it was both of them together,
versus the boulder. Son is putting in
that work! We gotta real chisel. We're getting major progress right here,
as you can see, there's giant cracks. There you go!
There it is! Oh, she blows! We got hope now, boys! While they're hammering
that rock, I wanna tell you about the brand new
MrBeast Lab's Hybrids. These test tubes just started
hitting shelves. Inside these are random parts of Hybrids
that you can mix and match to create your own unique
MrBeast Lab experiment. They call me the rock slayer! And to make these things even cooler,
we developed an animated show, so a lot of the characters you'll be
creating with these Hybrids, you'll actually see
in the show in October. We got 18 minutes! We're gonna be close
to this thing! Hybrids are available
wherever you buy toys. Go collect unique parts, and build your very own customizable beast
that only you have. Panthar, should they buy ‘em? Let's see if they smash
this rock open. And even though they were
working as a team, an hour a day for 10 days
is a pretty tight deadline. Inmates, your sixth hour is up. 1 for the rock,
0 for the inmates for today. We made no progress. No progress, son. We need something that's gonna help us
get that key to get that $100,000. Each new day, they swung
hundreds of times, but the rock
wasn't budging. We did a lot of work.
No major progress. We might not make it,
I'm not sure. If we lose that 50 grand,
I'm gonna quit. Ian realized force wasn't enough.
What they needed was knowledge. There’s gottta be an answer in here. Oh, a book about rocks. I ripped out the pages that had to do
with our exact task. It says we need to use leverage. You think it can fit
under this? Oh, yeah. Push it that way. I can stack weights
on there too, to hold— It’s not gonna budge… But they still couldn't even put
a dent into the rock. This is a grind. Tired of you, rock!
Sick of this. The rock was just too heavy to lift. So with 2 days left, Ian went back to
his book to search for more answers. There's another picture right here
I was able to find. It looks like we're supposed to use
a chisel on a weak point in the rock. This is the kinda
the weak spot. Oh, it's coming apart!
Look at this! It’s splitting, Lenny! Dude, the whole rock's
split in half. Yo, we might literally make
$100,000 today! Not getting any movement. Inmates, your ninth hour is up. Man, we had a good momentum,
but we ran outta time. We are almost through
this thing. It's gonna be the final day. This rock is no joke! No, it's not. Way harder than
I expected it to be. I think at this point, it’s 50/50
if we get through this thing. I’m ready to go. Inmates, it's rec time. Suit up! It's rock slaying time. This rock is goin’ down,
ladies and gentlemen! Your final hour starts now. Keep pushing. - I'm right here with you.
- Yeah, we gotta go a little deeper. That's a thick freaking slab. Let's get this thing outta here! Look at this!
We got a key yet? - Here's home!
- Yeah! The key's gotta be in here! You have 30 minutes remaining. You better hurry up on this! This concrete's the only thing in our way
from us and 100 grand! 15 minutes remaining. 10 minutes remaining. Oh my God,
the key’s out! Oh, baby! $100,000 right there! Get it! The $100,000 is
officially yours! - Let's go!
- Let's get it! - Let's go!
- A hundred grand baby! Cop and con! Cop and con, baby.
For life. Are you guys ready to hear
what the day 90 challenge is? - Yes!
- Yeah! What I'm about to offer is actually… …nothing. Because on day 99, we have something especially brutal
planned for the two of you. I'll see you then. Wow. What's happening day 99? All throughout this video,
Ian has stayed true to his convict ways. Time flies when
you're stealing books. Well on day 99, he will have the chance
to steal the entire prize pool. Today is day 91. But most importantly,
it's my man Ian's birthday. I woke up to a nice surprise by
my bunkmate over there. He's such a good guy. I can't believe I'm spending
my third birthday now in prison, but at least I got
a good bunkmate. But even with over
90 days behind them, Ian and Lenny never imagined
that the final 10 days would be the toughest of
their 100 day sentence. Going slow. Trying to find new ways
to pass time in here. There's nothing else
for us to do. You got access to
the library, right? That would give us something to do
if I just emptied the library. If you pulled the computer out
that would be hilarious. That would be great, son! And honestly,
I don't blame them, 'cause this is the only prison where
acting up won't extend your sentence. I'll wake up early tomorrow
and get it. Operation computer is a go! You crazy! We've set up shop!
There we go. Good job, buddy. We're in business baby!
We got somethin’ new to do! Normally I would punish
them for stealing, but with day 99 quickly approaching,
I'm just gonna wait until then. We should bring this thing in here
today as a little chair. That we can put in front
of the computer! - Yeah, this would be nice!
- Here you go. Warden Jimmy, we're doing whatever we can
to get back at you this week. Oh, we could be like two brothers
sitting down next to each other. Hello, buddy. It's kind of poetic, that throughout
this entire video, the thing that brought a cop and
a criminal closer together was stealing. I like seeing Lenny go over
the dark side a little bit. He's encouraging me to break the rules,
too, this time. We're taking extra rec time today. Time is up.
Please come inside. Another win for the inmates. You're a troublemaker. Yeah, I've adapted to it,
like I feel comfortable with it. I'm glad that I got to experience this
as a police officer. To understand what it feels like to be
on the other side of the fence. I have no regrets. But what both of
these prisoners don't know, I will be putting the relationship they've
been building over the last 99 days to the ultimate test. Boys, boys, boys. Well, well, well. 99 days ago,
you two were strangers. Do you guys think you're gonna be
friends outside of jail? - Oh, yeah.
- We’re definitely close. Well, let's see if this final challenge
changes that. - Ah, man.
- Here we go again. For this entire video,
we've been seeing how two people from completely different backgrounds
get along together. You've been through so many
ups and downs and it all comes down
to this final day here. Wow. And that's exactly why
for the next 24 hours, I’m gonna put each of you in two different
solitary confinement cells. Warden Jim.
Twice solitary? But this time
there's a twist, because in each of your cells,
there is a button. And if either one of you presses it
before the 24 hours is up, you leave your cell
immediately and walk away with the entire
$480,000 prize pool, thus stealing all of your
fellow inmate's money. That's foul, bro. I don't think you're
gonna take it, but you have to ask yourself,
is he gonna take it? Just like he stole the books,
the movies… And if so, should you take it
before he does? He cried a lot about solitary confinement
when it came down to the family visit, and he's been saying, ""He’s not paying me to ever
go back into there again."" Well now I'm paying you $480,000
to leave this room. I know, that's why
it's a very tempting offer. I could imagine. I think he’ll do it. - You think he will?
- I think he will. I'd hit that button
before he does. Alright. Do you need anything? Uh, Freedom? Yeah, just press
that button. Alright, the 24 hours has
now begun. Oh, and one final thing. You won't know if the other person is left
until that timer hits zero. This sucks, man. I don't know if trusting
the criminal with a red button that can give him $480,000
was the smartest idea. I mean a guy that went to prison for fraud
could be a little tempting, you know? Worried about Ian not being able
to make it through. How do I know that I can trust him
with this prize money? They've been through so much
throughout this video that it feels like they would never
screw each other. But as someone who's spent a lot of time
in solitary confinement, a lot of time alone to yourself
can make you see things differently. I think someone's pressing it. This is my first time in
solitary confinement. This is Ian’s second.
He’s scared of tight spaces. I don't like being in
tight, confined spaces like this. This is not meant for me. Just remember, you're free to leave
whenever you want to. All with the press of
that button. Honestly, for me, I don't want
to see this counter because it just gives me
anxiety looking at it. So I'm gonna use one of these garbage bags
and I’m gonna put it over the clock. I don't need it in my face. But the longer they sat
in those cubes, the harder they thought about
what they could do with their partner's
half of the money. If I just go and hit that
red button right there, I could pay off all my restitution
in just one shot. Well, I owed a half a million
when I got out of prison. I could fix everything in the past
in just one push. There's a lot of things that
I could do with $480,000. That's an education for my kids,
a new car for me and my wife, possibly another house,
all with the push of that button. Do I hit the button,
get the $480,000 and pay off all my old debt
and screw over Lenny? Might have to. And the longer Ian thought about the money
the more he realized he deserved it more. Honestly, I feel like I had a way worse
time than Lenny these 100 days. Especially because I didn't get that visit
and didn't get to see my family. How come I gotta spend twice as much time
in solitary than Lenny does? Doesn't make sense. If he left, that’d be heartbreaking. I've put in just as much
work as him. If he can't toughen up
for 24 hours, then it just goes to show that
his convict ways are still the same. There's been too many
doggings to go around. I've had enough. Good night. I hope that Ian is out there
when this all wraps up. 100 days. All dependent on
the last 24 hours. If you're in solitary,
please come out to the middle. I repeat, if you are in solitary,
please come out to the middle. There are currently black curtains
blocking off both sections of the prison. If you're both standing there,
you'll each evenly split that prize pool. But if only one of
you is there, then you just spent 100 days
in prison for nothing. 3, 2, 1… Drop the curtains! Boom! They didn't screw each other over. My man! That is your $240,000—
Well now he dropped some of the ground. And to celebrate,
we brought your families! You two are free men! Hopefully they never go
to prison again! If you haven't already,
turn on notifications. We upload every other Saturday. Look how happy they are.
This is amazing. I loved this video. And don't forget, we're still
raising money for Team Water. A $1 donation on average gives someone
1 year of clean water."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4hVGCWH1Kc,"2,000,000 People Get Clean Water For The First Time!",620,20250801,en,"We're on a mission to give
2 million people all around the world
clean water. This village in Malawi
now has clean water impacting over
1 thousand people. This is the first of many projects
we’re gonna be doing, and the largest creator collab
in history. Over 3,000 of your favorite creators
are all coming together with over 3 billion followers
combined. This could be one of the largest
philanthropy projects in history. Team Water. All of us, teaming up from
around the globe, to get clean water
that will last decades to over 2 million people
in need. All starting here in Malawi.
Let’s give away some water! We just installed this pump. This is gonna be
the first time we use it. So the first cup of water is going to
the village chief. Oh, he’s downing it! This entire community
used to survive on water collected from
puddles like this. And every drop had to literally be
carried by hand. And that's what they do
every single day. What does this water looks like?
I mean, look at all that dirt. If I drank this,
would I get sick? Yes, you probably shouldn't. I think we can all agree this is
very unacceptable. I mean, look at those
chunks of the dirt in this water. That will no longer happen now that
we have that well. With local leaders, we made sure
that clean water is no longer
a concern here. Wow, look how
excited they are. Over a thousand people that
live around here are gonna be supported by
just this pump. Orkun or Ben, who wants to sub in?
I’m gettin’ tired. These two have 55 million
subscribers combined, and are just 2 of the thousands of
creators that make up Team Water. Here you go. That's a lotta water. Jimmy, is it gonna last
forever? As long as this well
is maintained, which is obviously what
Team Water's gonna do, this well can practically
last forever. The well we started at and this
water pump are just the beginning. Team Water is on a mission
to raise $40 million so that we can provide over
2 million people clean water. Let's keep going! Next, we went to
South America, where we received an amazing welcome
from the people of Colombia. You guys are too kind,
you don't have to do this. Amazingly, the pump for
the local water source was designed from spare parts
by one man with no formal training. You built this with recycled
bicycle parts. Yes And this well, it's what's
currently supplying over 1,000 people
with water. Yes. Oh my goodness. Out this pipe comes water that
the communities are drinking. And at first glance, this water
doesn't look too bad. But really, there are
little particles of dirt and more importantly,
bacteria that is constantly getting
everyone here very sick. Which is why literally right
beside the well that Christo made with
bicycle parts, we built this giant
water filtration system. The system filters water
in 3 stages. This removes dirt, sand,
and large particles. The water is then
pumped into here, which removes the bacteria and
even smaller particles, and then is pumped into here,
which removes the saline so that fresh water can be
pumped through this pipe. If anyone deserves
the first glass of water to come out of
this filtration system… it's Christo. Be my guest. Oh, he's going right for it.
Oh, he's downing it! The water is tasty! Do you approve?
Is it good? Yes! Yes! Yes! Thank you. Even Yolo, with over 33 million
subscribers, couldn't help himself. This water is better
than in my home! Team Water is going around the globe
with all of your favorite creators, like Mark Rober, the Stokes Twins,
and so many more. With the mission of bringing
clean water, the most basic human right,
to millions of people. We also built this massive
water storage container that can hold the equivalent of
20,000 bottles of water, and because we brought
a ton of reusable bottles, we couldn't wait to share the fresh,
clean water with the community. Hey, we got water
for everybody here! But unfortunately,
nearly 1 in 10 people don't have access
to clean water. Which is why we need
your help to raise $40 million. On average,
every $1 donated will provide 1 person with
clean water for an entire year. To power the water filtration system,
we installed a solar farm here, but we couldn't
stop there. We also have a special surprise
for all the little kids. That's your brand new playground! They're way more excited about
the playground than they were about
the water I gave them. We then traveled to the site of
an existing clean water project, where more than 100 kids come
to school just to get clean water. Here you go! Here you go, little man.
Majd, this one's empty! Ah, Jimmy! And even though this community
has access to clean water, there was still
a problem. Since people from over
4 communities have to walk far to reach this central
water source, we added 3 tanks nearby
for easier access. Now I'm gonna show you
how much walking it's gonna save people
in the community. - These jugs are so heavy.
- Come on Jimmy, push! It's hard to believe
nearly 1 in 10 people don't have access
to clean water. So for every $1 they donate,
someone on average will get 1 year of
clean water. - Oh my gosh.
- Well done, Jimmy. As you can tell,
it's very hard to carry water. Team Water goes above and beyond
to take care of people. And of course, we also gave
this community a playground. And then we went just north of India
to Nepal, to this small village where locals hike up a winding trail
to reach this water tap, where they rely on just
a piece of cloth to filter their water. Behind me is
1 of the 3 tanks that’s gonna be providing
clean drinking water to over 300 people
in the community. This tank, when completed,
will hold 15,000 liters of water paired with a mechanism
to clean the water, disinfect it, and make it safe
to drink. Once this is done
being built, how long is the tank supposed to
service the community for? Easily, for at least
15 to 20 years. We've teamed with WaterAid,
our lead global partner, to help provide
clean drinking water. They also support local governments
that handle repair and make sure everything
keeps working. Not only we're providing
the project, but we're maintaining it
for decades to come. We should probably
get back to work. Yeah, we should. You know it’s gonna take over
2,700 kilos of concrete to complete
this water tank. I think I've worked
18 hours today, but if that means these people get
clean drinking water just 1 day early I’ll work 24. Don't look me in the eyes
doing this, bro. Those three water tanks will provide
clean drinking water to 71 households and
around 300 people. On average every $1 donated’s
gonna provide clean water for an entire year
to someone in need. Make sure to donate! And if you're in
the United States, you might think this only affects
other countries. But science creator Mark Rober and I
are hard at work because in 2022, flooding caused
Jackson, Mississippi's entire water system
to fail, which had this assisted living
facility struggling. Having water to brush
your teeth, prepare meals for
your food, to take a bath. And to solve
this issue, we have a machine that pulls
water out of the air? That's right.
An atmospheric water generator. And I've no idea what
that means, which is why I brought
Mark Rober. What does this do? So you know how on
a really hot day your glass gets beads
of water on the outside? Yeah 'cuz, like, the water
goes through the glass. It's not going through
the glass, Jimmy. That water is coming
from the air. This machine
cools down the air, and then it can't hold
that water anymore, at which point you collect it
in this big tank. Plus it purifies it all
in the process. It's basically just squeezing and
wringing out air. How is that
humanly possible? This water is so
clean and fresh, you could use it
in an operating room. Cheers. Wow.
Science is amazing. This machine generates
enough water for the entire
assisted living facility, and they're going to be giving it to
other people in the community who also struggle
to get clean water. Team Water, we are eternally grateful
for everything. And Team Water is also partnering
with Dig Deep to give the people of
Rhodell, West Virginia an updated water system. In previous years,
they just had a lot of problems with the infrastructure
crumbling, so this should do a lot of good
for this community. All the way over
in Ecuador, we're with Ricky Limon and
4 of his friends with over 120 million
subscribers combined, and they're gonna help
clean up the water from this dangerously
contaminated river. Even though it's very beautiful,
the water here is dirty. The river is full of germs,
like E. Coli and Giardia. And unfortunately for the village
right next to the river, it's the only source of water for
them and their children. 34% of kids under 5, they got
malnutrition and stomach issues. So to change
these kids' lives, we're building filtration for each of
the 3 water storage tanks, using reverse osmosis filters
to make the water safe to drink. It comes out
completely clear. It's like magic. Great! I know that means
""very good"" Yes, this is
very good. And with some help,
we're giving water filtration bags to everyone in
the community so they can have clean water
with them anywhere they go. It will work so you can
drink the water. Did you tell her what
the bag is for? Yeah, I just told that, bro. I was just checking. Thanks to the Amazon Rainforest
Investor Coalition for supporting the amazing work
that's being done in this video. Meanwhile, across the world
in Zambia, fitness creator Browney is at
the largest community in this video. There are a staggering
9,000 people that do not have access
to clean water here, and their only option
is to dig shallow wells that often
get polluted. It's not covered,
so when we receive rainfall, there’s flooding into this well,
it gets contaminated. You'll find yourself
in the hospital. So we installed 3
10,000 liter water tanks to make sure that every last one
of the 9,000 people here have access
to clean water. Is it good?
Yes, good! Now that these tanks are supplying
brand new water stations all around
the community, they can finally fill
those old, unsafe wells. Let's go. Putting a stop
to this! The projects you guys saw in
this video are just a sample size of what we're gonna be doing
with Team Water to give 2 million people clean water
all around the world. Five years ago,
we did Team Trees, where we raised $20 million
to plant 20 million trees, and 3 years ago we did Team Seas,
where we raised $30 million to pull 30 million pounds of trash
out of the ocean. And now we're back
with Team Water. Only this time is
the audacious goal of $40 million. To give 2 million people
all around the world clean water for
decades each. And none of this
would be possible without our
lead global partner, WaterAid. If you want to donate, just click
the donate button down below. Or you can go to
teamwater.org, where you can see
every single donation, you can leave messages
when you donate. You can also see
the top donaters. And me and Mark Rober know
we can't raise $40 million on our own which is why you're gonna see
thousands of creators uploading videos, TikToks, shorts,
reels, Instagram photos about Team Water. And on top
of donating, I need you guys to go engage
with all that content. I need you to share it.
I need you to spread the word. And I need you to harass
your favorite creators to support
Team Water. Do your part to
make this a success. If you're watching this video
when it first goes up, you'll notice
the counter doesn't start at $0. It's starting at
$500,000. That's because Shopify,
who powers the Team Water merch store has stepped up with
a $500,000 donation. Thank you, Shopify. Also a special thanks
to YouTube, who will match the next $2 million
donated to Team Water. So if you donate to
Team Water right now, instead of giving someone 1 year
of clean drinking water, you'll actually be
giving them 2."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzBi1nwDn8U,"Survive 100 Days Trapped In A Private Jet, Keep It",1983,20250719,en,"I just bought this luxurious private jet. And if this pilot can spend a hundred days trapped inside, he keeps it. >> No joke. I spent two and a half a million dollars on this private jet. And once you step inside, the 100 days will begin. >> Oh my god. >> And now that hour one of this 100 day challenge has started. I say we kick things off by taking it for a spin. Let's go. Let's take it for a spin. >> We're about to find out if he's a real pilot. He >> woohoo. If Armando stays on this plane for the next 100 days, it will forever be his to fly anywhere he wants all around the world. 100 days living in this thing. No problem. That was a smooth ride. This thing is nice. We'll see if the landing smooth. What a great flight. That was awesome. >> You're now 2 hours into your 100 day challenge. But if any part of your body touches the ground outside this plane, the video ends and you lose this private jet. >> Don't touch the ground. >> Good luck. See you when I see you. Let's see if Arando can win this private jet. >> What do I do now? This is my usual office. And here is the dining room. And allow me to show you the bedroom. This is where I will sleep apparently for the next 3 months. >> I don't have a real kitchen. Got a microwave and a airline cart full of canned meats. I don't have a shower. That's going to be a challenging part. >> And he is not wrong because even though this jet is a worldass vehicle, it's not built for a person to live in. So, over the next 100 days, it is going to get a lot more difficult. The walls are starting to cave in. This is what prison is like. Maybe I'm hallucinating. Sunshine makes me happy. I'm missing my family. Well, that's not good. Weird falling out of the sky. I am ready to be done with this. It's night one. I don't have a bed. The best option might be the chair. Good night. This is going to be my own private jet. It is day two. You would think this is a comfortable jet. It is not that comfortable to sleep in. >> It's day two. What better way to kickstart this video than to use this private jet for our personal game. Yeah, >> me and the boys are thinking. You want to fly us to a hockey game in New York? >> Let's do it. You can come, bro. We got you a ticket. This is not a trick. >> If you get off the plane, you lose. But you can still go to the game. Well, we'll see. >> And take us to the hockey game he did. But once we did land, thanks for the play. >> I wish I was going to a hockey game. I just had to stay inside. Wonder what Armando is doing right now. Playing yoga. Yeah. >> Using the jet just to go to a hockey game was so fun that the next day the boys and I had another trip in mind. Do you mind taking us to Miami, Florida? >> 100%. >> And that's the beauty of owning this private jet because we can literally fly wherever we want. >> All right. Welcome to Miami. >> Let's go have fun, boys. >> See you later. I love the fact that they are using a jet. I wish I could talk to my wife, my daughter. I miss them so much. But I still got 96 days of this challenge to go. Hope I can make it. This is my first day just hanging out in the hanger. I got to get in a routine. >> And so over the next few days, Armando would exercise, >> crab walk. Oh, that's more work than I thought it was going to be. >> Make his meals in the microwave, mix vegetables for the morning, clean himself without a shower. The only way I have to clean myself is with dude wipes. Make sure we're clean. Use the goodies. and try to find any place to sleep. >> My bed is a bust. Cut really messed up my neck. This is the only place in this airplane that I can fully stretch out. But even that wasn't enough to make Armando comfortable. I cannot stare at these four walls. We got to fly this airplane. And the following morning, that's exactly what he did. >> Never have I gotten the keys to a jet, go wherever I want. We're going to Niagara Falls. Going to go see them from the air. That is so awesome. Tell me that's not the coolest thing you've ever seen. We are at 4,000 ft over Niagara Falls. No jets ever get to do this. Hawker is a two pilot airplane. My great co- captain is here with me. The best office in the world. It is the best office. >> But unlike Armando, his co-pilot can actually leave the private jet. The end of my universe is right there. And even though he couldn't leave those steps come day 10, I devised a little loophole to change that. >> Ah, damn it. >> I screamed and you didn't even stop the door. >> No. What's life been like the last 10 days? >> Jimmy, there's no shower, no bed, there's no real kitchen. Overall, pretty good. That's not where I thought he was heading with that sentence. But I may just have a solution for you. Every 10 days, I'm going to present you an offer on this private jet. And your day 10 offer is a choice. You can choose between receiving these coordinates, which will lead you to a runway with $50,000 in cash on it, or Alpha, bring in the goods. I hook up a shower to your private jet. And before you make your decision, I feel like I should at least let you see the shower. And because it would obviously be an extension of your jet, you will not be eliminated if you enter that room. Ooh, looks like a real shower. And even though you don't need it, it comes with shampoo. Yeah. It's not only that it's a shower, this is space. I can stand up. This is amazing. >> It's time to make a decision. A shower for 90 days or $50,000 in cash. Which do you want? >> Showers for 90 days would be great. I'm going for the cash. >> Whoa. What? Oh my gosh. I'm meant to fly. The airplane's meant to fly. Let's take it. >> I can't believe he said no to the shower. Have fun retrieving the 50 grand. I can't wait. And now that I think about it, with this specific pilot, I guess shampoo wasn't really an enticing offer after all. >> Someone is going to meet us at these coordinates with $50,000 in cash, >> which on top of his $2.5 million jet could potentially make Armando the highest paid winner in the history of the Mr. Beast channel. $50,000 for not showering. >> No brainer. >> My biggest problem tonight is where am I going to put $50,000? So now I can actually take my family places. I can go to sleep with the sweet smell of money tonight. My weirdest task of this challenge so far is how to reorganize all this cash into as few cases as possible so they don't take up room in my airplane. Feel like the wolf of Wall Street. I might just sleep on money. 50 grand might have helped his bed situation, but it created a whole new problem in Arando's head. >> What on earth would I do with this thing if I actually got the keys to it? Do I sell it? Would I keep it? >> Owning this jet would be a dream come true for a pilot like Armando. But there's one huge problem. >> I just did a little bit of math. After the challenge, if I own this airplane for 3 months, that's going to be $8,000 for a hanger, $10,000 in insurance, $30,000 in maintenance. Obviously, the cost of owning a private jet can really add up. Which is why throughout this video, he has a chance to win up to an extra million on top of this $2.5 million jet in prizes and money. So, if he does end up winning, he can actually afford to keep it and make his family's dreams come true. I can't help but picture my family and friends in this airplane having just the best time going to some destination. I can picture it. Looks like I'm going to have to win a lot more money from Jimmy. >> I can't help but think that military service helped me prepare for this. Always started with being excited and being happy to be there. Then you get into your groove and then you hate your life and all your life choices and then you start seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. >> It's a Fortnite 2 weeks into this challenge and Armando is trying to remain optimistic. That's a great meal. Upgrading myself to a feastable. This is how I'm keeping track of all my chores. Here's the things that I haven't done today, and I just move them over as the day goes along. >> But even with a good attitude, he still might not make it 100 days because of his horrible sleep situation. >> I can't figure out how to sleep without something hurting. It goes down and up and down and up. It's the first day that my body is not happy with me. My workout was weak. My stomach feels icky. I don't know that I got a great night's sleep. Tried the couch again last night. It was a miserable failure. 10 minute one. That's how I'm feeling today. I'm really curious what he's going to offer tomorrow, but I need a bed. I had the perfect offer for Arando. But since I was filming a video where I was giving away a million meals, he had to come to me. Here we go. And to thank him for the flight, I brought Arando a special meal of his own. Since we're in Philadelphia, we got you some Philly cheese. How long is the flight to North Carolina? >> 48 minutes. Oh, that's it. >> Our private jet is awesome. Tomorrow is day 20. Time flies. >> All right, let's get All right, let's go. Normally, my offer would come on day 20, but in order to fully appreciate it, I'm giving Armono the opportunity to sleep on it. Your day 20 offer is this custommade inflatable bench specifically for this plane, or I give you coordinates to a mystery crate hidden somewhere across the world. And hidden inside that crate could be anything. Could be a quarter of a million dollars, could be a Tesla. It could be worth more than the jet itself. >> Oh man. >> I'll see you tomorrow for your decision. And so I left Armando for the night thinking he would try out the bed, but I didn't expect him to share his bed with a cheese steak sandwich. He must really need some sleep. >> That was the first night that I've slept comfortably on this airplane. >> Let's see if he chooses this inflatable bed or the mystery gift, which is actually worth $250,000. [Music] Knock knock. Is anyone in here? Come in. Welcome aboard. It's day 20. Yay. Please come into my living room, dining room, and bedroom. Be honest. How was the night's sleep? It was like sleeping on little baby clocks. Do you think having this bed increases the probability you make it 100 days? I know with this, my body can make it 100 days. >> On the other side, though, at a random set of coordinates hidden anywhere on this planet is the mystery box. This is something I can feel right now. I can't fly this airplane without getting a good night's sleep. Would you prefer this inflatable bed or the magnificent ginormous mystery gift? I'm in it for the long run. I am going to choose the bed to make 100 days. Yeah. >> Really? The mystery gift was a Lamborghini. >> Really? >> Yeah. >> Oh, don't dream of Lamborghinis tonight. >> Yeah. I'll count them in my sleep. Can't believe he just turned that down. Carl, he declined the Lamborghini. >> Okay, his lost. Turned down a Lamborghini. Whatever. It's cool. I got a bed. This is going to be a game changer. With this, my body can make it another 80 days. Thanks to the bed, Arando is thriving. Well, I feel like my eye is on the final prize, which is owning this jet. I want to learn about my airplane. It's only about 2,000 pages, but this is still an endurance challenge, and it's about to get way more difficult. Beautiful day to fly. Armando, how you doing? I would love to take the airplane somewhere. Interesting. But what if I told you for the rest of this challenge, you can't fly unless I say so. But you'll need to keep practicing because later in this video, you'll face the greatest challenge in your piloting career. So, I'd start practicing if I were you. Good luck. I can't wait. Let's do this. I practice in here putting in the routes are takeoff speeds, time speeds, emergency speeds, performance numbers, just part of professional flying. This morning I woke up and I started dreaming about all my dream places that I want to go. And while these practice flights may have been a great way to spend his time, Armando couldn't resist making it all about food. New Orleans is one of those places that I want to go to. Creole food and some beignet. There's a lot of good cuisine. Charleston seafood. I am very much partial to New York pizza. flying to Key West Cuban sandwich and some empanadas about barbecue today. And it's no wonder he's fantasizing about food when this is what he's been eating for almost a month now. >> I will not lie, it smells like cat food for 100 days. No one said this challenge was going to be easy. It's been 30 days since he started living on this plane. We have a very special offer. >> Hi guys. >> Come on down. Do you recognize this? >> I do. >> It's a galley cart full of food. the exact same food you've been eating the last 30 days. Since you only have 24 hours of food left, I brought you enough food to resupply you till the end of the video. Okay, but before we restock your jet with enough food for the next 70 days, I have an offer for you. Okay, you can turn down the canned chicken and tuna that you've been eating in exchange for a phone that has Door Dash installed that you can use whenever to order whatever you want. >> Obviously, the phone only has the Door Dash app, no call or text. But the catch is if you choose Door Dash, you have to let whatever is in this mystery box live with you in the jet for 24 hours. That's an entire day sharing this tiny space with something horrible. Don't don't open it. Don't open it. Things are breathing in there. Yeah. Well, I did do 22 years in the military. I feel like I could probably handle myself. I don't know if this is going to surprise anybody, but I'm going to pick the Door Dash. >> Really? Yeah. When you open this, whatever is inside of here is stuck with you for the next 24 hours. >> 24 hours. >> Here, give it a bang test. No. Harder. >> Snakes get violent when you do that. >> Three. >> Oh my god. >> Two. One. Open. >> You're stuck with Nolan. Have fun, Nolan. Try not to annoy him too much. >> Why would I ever be annoyed? >> I'm super excited about this. I have not had like human interaction really. Armando hasn't had much personal connections over the last 30 days, and Nolan hasn't had any in 26 years. What if I just started smashing things? I'm going to press buttons. >> Arando, stop letting him press buttons. >> Self-destruct. You do. I can't. I can't. I need to leave. No. Nolan in the cockpit. Oh my god, I'm so excited about this. >> Ooh, tacos. I guess if you're starving for attention and gourmet food, >> that smells amazing. >> This isn't the worst punishment. I don't know why you've been complaining about the food. This guy way better than Ken chicken. I feel like it's going to be a fun night. Let's see who the real pilot is. Oh man, I am the pilot now. Jimmy didn't say what you could order or how much money you could spend on Door Dash. I just wanted tacos. Tacos and we're going to buy a lot of things from a lot of stores. So the next day when I returned, I was in for a pretty big surprise. Nolan, what the heck? Come check it out. I had no idea, but Nolan and Armando had used Door Dash to order so much insane stuff just to decorate the jet. All this was available on Door Dash. >> Yeah, this was cool and all. I kind of needed the jet to fly me today. Are you saying we got to get rid of the tree and stuff? >> I'm saying we got to get rid of everything. Armando, we got to take some stuff off. We had to clean up the plane so it would be safe to fly, but it was worth it since where I was going, we were about to make a much bigger mess while shooting another video. While we were blowing up stuff, Nolan and Armono were still back in the jet. >> Now that Jimmy's gone, we have a couple hours. We do. >> I think we fly somewhere. Okay. It's a beautiful flight down to Florida today. I'm down for that. >> And they actually did fly down to the Florida Keys, which I just found out when I watched this video. Literally right now. >> That's the end of my 24-hour period on the jet. >> Shut it. >> Thank you for flying me to the Florida Keys. >> Get out of here. >> And he did get out of here. >> I'll bring souvenirs for the entire day. And when they flew back to Georgia to pick us up, I had no idea that they had ever left. 45 minutes home. Let's go. >> Now that Armando was alone in the hanger, the very first thing he did was bust out Door Dash to order more food. I could have almost anything. Going to do some bow buttons for dinner. This is going to be so much better than canned tuna. I'm ordering pasta. This is going to be a good one. I can eat fresh fruit and vegetables whenever I want. >> But soon, Armando started using the app for more than just food. >> Love it. I love it. I love it. cleaning supplies. This is a vacuum cleaner. Oh, yes. This is amazing. You can order almost anything. I get some resistance bands. Having Door Dash has been a game changer. I finally feel like I've nested. I've made this place my home. I feel at peace. >> But Armando soon realized that there's one thing you just can't Door Dash. I would love the chance to take this airplane all the way across the world with my family. I have a lot of great adventures. I've been to 70 countries, climbed Kilamanjaro, raced motorcycles, flown all kinds of airplanes, and met some of the best people in the world. I want to take my beautiful wife and daughter with me all around the world in this private jet. Probably the biggest thing now that I have a bed and Door Dash and I can order anything. I'm still alone. When Jimmy and the team come on board and we get to go somewhere, those are the only times that I really get to have fun in here. It made sense that he was getting lonely. You see, every video where a contestant stays for a long time, eventually the isolation starts to eat at them. And that's why when Armando had finally made it 40 days on a private jet, I wanted him to have some company. But I was deep in the jungle exploring ancient temples. So, I sent Carl and Chandler to help cheer him up. We have a really cool offer for you. A vacation with me and Chandler for $50,000? >> Yeah, I don't think so. >> Oh, $25,000? M. No. >> $10,000? I don't think so. >> All right. How about a dollar >> for $1? >> The deal. >> Deal. >> Here's your shirt. Welcome. >> All right. Where are we going, fellas? Let's open up the board. Check it out. >> This is a antilimactic. >> Woo. You're going to have the time of your life. Don't worry. Look at this strong guy. >> Yeah. A little fruit platter. [Music] I know what you're thinking. You're thinking, ""How can this vacation get better?"" Let's open the door. Projector system. I love it. Let's do a movie. This night would have been worth 50K. I had a great time. >> I feel like I'm recovering from a party. >> A lot of times, the day after a check-in is the hardest because on check-in days, you have a lot of activity. You get to see people. You get to talk to people. Today I'm kind of coming down from all that. Just here by myself with my thoughts. This stretch is a test. No flying, staring at the walls. I don't think this challenge is going to get easier. The biggest thing is going to be keeping my mind busy. So I came up with a routine. I sit up on the flight deck every day and I practice a flight all day long. >> Check was complete. >> But Armando found that indulging in flights of fancy only caused him to think about what he was really missing. I have this little doll of my daughter. Everywhere I go, even if there's turbulence, she's just happy and dancing. I wonder if she misses me. This morning, I woke up just thinking about like family. Like, I miss them. I want to go see them. I just want to cuddle with my wife. My weak point is my family. They deserve to know how I'm doing. Just want a hug. I'll take a hug. Coming up on halfway through the challenge. Almost day 50. I regret not being there for my family. I cannot believe that I have not stepped foot off this airplane. >> It's day 50. Let's see how are our boys doing. Armando, I thought you forgot about me. >> Yeah. How's it going? >> Oh my gosh. >> How's the first 50 days of the challenge been? >> I don't know what's going on in the outside world. I haven't seen anybody but you guys. I miss my family. This is the longest I've ever gone without seeing them, without talking to them. >> What if we made a phone call? Oo, >> I would love a phone call. Oh my gosh, I'm already tearing up. >> Babe. >> Babe. >> Babe. >> Oh my god. >> Oh my god. I miss you. >> Oh, I miss you so much, baby. >> Oh, >> your husband is now halfway done with the jet challenge. You know, if he potentially flew into your airport, would you meet him there and hang out with him tonight? >> 100% yes. >> I'm all like, ""Let's get this airplane ready."" >> As soon as I see them, I need to make sure I do not run off the airplane. I cannot wait for that first hug. There better be a marching band when we pull in. This is going to be a tearjerker. >> Maddie, look. I see you waving a damn. >> I just can't wait for my kid to run into my arms. Oh my god. Oh my god. Baby, hi. >> I knew I was going to cry. Welcome home. Welcome to my house. >> Okay. >> I haven't showered since the day I left the house. >> Oh, this is so cute. you know, just having a little jet picnic. >> It was clear that seeing his family gave Armando a much needed boost of energy, and he savored every moment he could. I can't believe I'm here. >> But unfortunately, these moments are always fleeting. It's a little surreal to be back in the hanger after having a day with my family. Now, they're just like forefront in my mind for the next 50 days. that could make it harder to make it the rest of the challenge. But being away from his family wasn't the only thing weighing on Armando. The walls are starting to cave in a little bit. It's starting to feel real tight in here. A little claustrophobic. Ow. Oh, godly. Not a whole lot of room in a private jet. This is what prison is like. There's only four more offers before day 100. I think Jimmy's going to make me an offer between extra space or maybe some extra money. Extra space. That would be really nice, but I'd have to think about it because I need like over $100,000 just to fly it and house it. How's it going? It's always good to see you. Can I have you at the door, sir? Absolutely. What do you think the offer is? I think it's going to be space related. Not space. >> Like we're going to take this to space. >> No. No. Like I think you're going to offer me more space. >> That is correct. for day 60. Carl, bring it on in. >> Coming. Hello. Wow. I am offering you an entire gym trampoline. >> Oh man. Everything you could possibly need is on this platform. Holy moly. Come on over. Yeah. Well, don't fall. >> How does it feel to be standing outside of the jet? It actually feels amazing. This is designed like the jet. It is currently touching the jet. So, it is a part of the jet. >> I could sleep out here. You can open the door and get fresh air out here. >> Oh my gosh. >> And you can have all of this for the measly price of $50,000. >> 50k. The same 50 grand you won on day 10. That same money you've been saying you need to maintain this jet. >> The only thing I needed was space. But for 50k, >> the only thing I need is a yes or a no. >> I like that. Let's go. >> 50 grand coming back to me or 50 grand staying in your pocket, but you're trapped in a jet. 10 9 8 Start counting. 7 We need an answer. 5 4 >> I'll take this space. >> Wa! >> Really? >> No tasty back seats. This space is now yours. But before you enjoy it, I kind of need a flight to New York. Let's go to New York. Before he can enjoy his new space, Armando had to fly me and my fiance Tia to the biggest indoor ski slope in America and then Florida for a private dinner by Chef Gordon Ramsay. >> Thanks for waiting. >> Absolutely. >> Let's head back home. >> Let's go home. >> But now it was finally time for Arando to try his new space. I'm actually getting to spend some time in what I'm calling the yard. This is amazing. Look at my kingdom. I just sit out here, have coffee. The extra room also made his workouts much easier. I was struggling to walk a mile per day. I just walked 3 and 1/2 miles in under an hour. I'm focusing on my mind, my body, and getting to 100. It's basically like having a playground attached to this airplane. It's a feastable kind of day. It is actually like an upscale European chocolate. Tastes really great. Feastable chocolate is made with simple, high quality ingredients and ethically sourced. Go get Feastables at Walmart right now and help us end child labor in the chocolate industry by eating Fastables. Armando was so happy about his new space that he was spending almost all of his time out there. I can't wait to see what Jimmy has for tomorrow. >> But what Armando didn't know was that I wasn't going to visit on day 70 because when I checked in and saw how much better Armando was doing, I worried we might have made things a little too easy. Haven't heard from Jimmy. Haven't had a check-in. Day 71. Hours and hours going by. It's day 72. No check-in from Jimmy. 73. Haven't heard from Jimmy. It's day 74. I'm starting to think he forgot about me. When I started this challenge, I thought the challenge was going to be flying all over the country. However, it's not. And even though the yard had improved Armono's quality of life, it couldn't give him what he needed the most, connection. Imagine being by yourself and not talking to anybody for 100 days. That's probably the biggest challenge is just the isolation. Goodbye, fellow hawker jet. I wish I was you flying away. I don't know what Jimmy's going to offer me. I just hope it involves flying. It's day 80. Sorry, missed day 70. I was taking my fiance on dates. Hi, guys. In 20 days, assuming you don't touch the floor, you'll be a free man with a $2.5 million jet. I can't wait. Dream flights with my family, with my friends. Those dream flights probably cost money. You know, view on a PJ is expensive. For day 80, would you like a chance to win some money? >> Are you offering? >> Give me one second. You guys just talk to him. >> Uh, we don't know what he's doing. >> For your day 80 offer, I have 10 cards. And remember on day 30 where you got the Door Dash phone? Uh, yes I do. We're about to put it to good use because on each of these 10 cards, there are coordinates to airports scattered across the entire country. You must fly this jet to each city. And when you get there, order an item on Door Dash. No matter what obstacles you run into, you must collect all 10 items and be back in North Carolina by day 90. And if you can, me and Door Dash will give you $50,000 in cash. Oh, airport number one's in Ohio. Good luck. >> I was worried about how am I going to fly this airplane once I win it. >> So, this money is the difference between making everyone's dreams come true or letting everyone down. If you gave me 10 days to get 10 items, we have planned 8 days to get 10 items because losing this challenge is not an option. I'm in Cleveland. I got to door dash a power bank. First item, Cleveland Power Bank. Order complete. >> Armando spent the night in Cleveland and decided to plan ahead for his stop in Charlotte. I know exactly what airport I'm going to. I know what address. I know what time I'm going to be there. With Door Dash and Dashpass, I can schedule a delivery and I am getting item number two in Charlotte. Pretty cool to be coming home to Charlotte. >> Here you go, sir. >> Thank you very much. Next stop, Providence, Rhode Island. I totally got this. >> Armando is gaining confidence and he knocked out the next three deliveries. That $50,000 good as mine. And then this happened. >> Oh, what's that? Uh, well, that's not good. She's falling apart. All right, we're taking her down. And due to maintenance, Armando was forced to spend the night in Denver. These little maintenance issues are starting to come up. >> One of our main gear struts was low. Luckily, we found a mechanic to come out and take care of it. We are headed to Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Yellowstone National Park to pick up a board game. >> Armono thought that the obstacles were behind him, but the issue wasn't maintenance anymore. It was weather. >> Supposed to go to Portland, Oregon. The weather's not looking great. I think we're going to divert to Idaho. I am losing one of my 10 days to weather. There's $50,000 on the line. I can't lose another day. It is what it is. All right, we just took off from Drake, Idaho. Now we're headed to Portland, Oregon to pick up champions. I have acquired seven of the 10 items on the scavenger hunt all over the country. I've got three left with only 3 days to go. I have absolutely zero margin for error right now. That is amazing. I need money to operate this thing once I win it. It looks like I'm going to get back to Jimmy on day 10. I just landed in Tampa, Florida. This is my last item, a Bluetooth speaker. I just ordered it and it's going to be here in 15 minutes. This is my last item. This is $50,000. Thank you very much. 10 items, 10 cities. Last one. Tampa, Florida. It is day 10 and we are headed back to the home hanger. Only 10 more days until this jet is mine. That's pretty awesome. Armando de, you just won $50,000. Catch, boys. All right, throw the items in here. Camping utensils. Had no idea what you meant by that. And not only did Door Dash give him $50,000, but they're also giving the chance for 10 of you to win $10,000 for scanning this QR code and signing up for Door Dash right now. If you don't have Door Dash on your phone, you're literally living life on hard mode. It's super easy. And while you're at it, you might as well sign up for Dash Pass for exclusive deals and discount. Scan the QR code, download it now. Thank you, Door Dash. Back to this challenge, though. On day 100, obviously, you'll win this $2.5 million jet, a bunch of money. It'll be great. But at the same time, I'm also going to offer you enough money so that you can fly this jet as much as you want. But in order to win it, you'll have to compete in another 100 day video on this jet. Another 100 days on this plane for half a million dollars. >> I don't know how I feel about that. Okay, luckily, you'll have 10 days to think about it. on day 100. Will I keep going for another 100 days for a half a million dollars? I don't know. Big decision. >> Armando survived the first 90 days on this jet. But the decision to possibly remain another 100 days became more difficult the more he thought about it. I've got pretty much everything that I need. I've got decorations. I've got a bed. Getting Door Dash was a game changer. I miss my family, but I don't have to worry about them because they've got a really good support network. If I had taken all of Jimmy's offers, I would have $100,000, a Lamborghini, and a private jet. But half a million, that pays for everything. I was almost at the end of this. If I were to sell it, I get $2.5 million for this jet, but getting another half million for another 100 days. I could actually keep the jet for longer than a couple months and fly it to all the places I want to go. Maybe around the world, Italy, Croatia. 100 days, take the jet, go home. Martha's Vineyard and it could stay an extra 100 days for half a million dollars. A lot of money. Do I need it? I don't know. Might be a game changer. Mexico City in Japan. Another 100 days for half a million dollars. Another 100 days from your family. Another 100 days on this plane for half a million dollars. It is the morning of day 100. Still haven't made my decision. >> It's day 100. How you feeling? I made it. There's still technically 10 minutes left. Don't step off. Can we spend the last few minutes in the cockpit? Let's do it. Yeah. I just realized I've never actually sat in the cockpit. >> All right. Welcome to the business end of the private jet. Do you remember what I asked you on day 90? >> I do. I've thought about it a lot. >> Good. But before you tell me your choice, bring them out. Tariq, >> come on, babe. We did this. >> Oh my goodness. >> Here's the thing. Your family has no idea about the second offer. The next 100 days for $500,000. >> I heard $500,000 just now. >> Enough money where you can fly this wherever you want. Whenever you want. You can fly them around. >> No. >> Yo, they're sorry. They're yelling at you. >> No. Say no. Oh, whatever it is, say no. >> Oh, she heard us. She said whatever it is. No. >> I've been through enough. >> Okay. Well, that might make it a little harder on you. Armando, I need you to come to the back. >> He better not stay on that jet. >> Yes or no? Do you want to do another 100 days? I If Armando steps off this jet right now, he'll end the video and walk away with the largest prize we've ever given away on this channel. But if he stays on, he's signing up to be in a new video where he'll compete for an additional $500,000. The past 100 days have all come down to this final decision. >> Daddy, >> this is the deed to the private jet. It's officially in your family's name. >> We own a private jet. >> Where are we going? Orlando. >> Orlando. Turn on notifications so you don't miss a video ever again. I hope you enjoyed."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWAdfuPpLOc,World's Fastest Car Vs Cheetah!,1236,20250705,en,"Who's faster? A cheetah or one of
the fastest cars in the world? Can a man beat a bear in
a fight? Can a tiger beat the world-record
high jumper? We're gonna answer all of these
and more— starting with the strongest man
in the world. And he's about to test his strength
against a 500-pound lion in a game of
tug-of-war. Any last words? It's go time. 3, 2, 1… Go! Alright and
we’re off. Oh my gosh!
Look at his mouth! Look at that
brute strength. Oh my gosh. The lion’s literally holding
the strongest man in the world back right now! Wait, what is he doing? Did that lion just
turn around? It looks like he's trying to
wear Brian out. Here's Brian pulling
a literal plane. But right now, he cannot get
this lion to budge. He’s starting
to struggle! Brian's actually
doing this! Oh, ok. Ok. You got like
3 feet left. You're almost
there! Brian, you’re almost
there! Brian won! Brian won, congrats! Yes! Brian just won! Did you have fun? Oh, ok.
I just— I won't talk to him.
That's fine. But that's just the first of
seven challenges that will test man
versus animal. Up next, we have the highest
vertical leaper on the planet. No joke.
That's his Guinness World Record. Of all 8 billion humans alive,
none can jump higher than him. And he's gonna be going against this
tiger to see who can jump higher… man or animal. Team Human.
Let’s go. Look at that majestic beast. Do you actually think you
can out-jump that? I’m not gonna lie. If she jumps 13,
I’m jumping 13. Oh, look how she's looking at him.
She's scoping you out. Is that a threat? She doesn't speak
English. I say we get into it. They’re gonna use this meat
to lure her and see if they can get her
to jump. - Let me see what you got, Luna.
- Oh, she wants it. Here it is. Here comes
the jump. How high will the tiger
jump? Oh my gosh! Now, if you can somehow jump
higher than the tiger… I want it to be because you beat
your own world record. So I'm not putting this
at 10 ft, 9 in. I'm going to put it
at 12 ft, 3 in. Exactly 1 inch higher than
your Guinness World Record. If he manages to touch this,
not only will he decimate the tiger, but he will set
a new world record. I mean, I think I got it.
12' 3""? - Yeah.
- I don't see why not. I’m gonna be honest,
I think Darius is lying. I'm not gonna lie,
I dang near think I'm lying. This does not seem
humanly possible. For the world record attempt.
Are you ready? Let’s get it. Let's see if you can set
that world record! Luna, this is for you. Can he do it? Oh my gosh!
Whoa, he crushed it! That was crazy! Luna, what are you gonna
say to that? Bro, you just jumped higher than
anyone in history. And you seem chill. Ah, I feel like
I can go higher. - I'm not gonna lie to you.
- Oh my gosh, this guy. I feel like I could go higher. You just set a world record.
He's like, ""Oh, I could go higher."" Brian beat a lion.
Darius beat a tiger. Animals need to
start winning. Team Human.
Let's go. I think Team Human is going to have
a much harder time with this next
competition. We are now in a bull arena
with Bubba. Hello. - Bubba is a bull rider.
- Yes, sir. We are gonna release 3 bulls
in this arena. 3 bulls? You need to carry as many bags of
money as you can all the way to the other side
of the arena, with 3 bulls chasing you
in the process. Every dollar you get in the bucket
in the next 3 minutes, you keep. - I'm ready, Jimmy.
- Good luck. Release the bulls! Here they come! Bubba, please
don't die. They're through the gate,
and they're coming right at him. Ok. Oh, they're
chasin’ him! Oh! Oh, they went right
past him. Take the money, Bubba!
Keep going! Go! He lost his hat. He's already secured
$10,000… Bubba!
Behind you! …but how long can he stay clear
of the bulls? Alright, here we go. He just got 2 more bags. - They're right behind you!
- Run, Bubba, run! Oh my gosh. I'd be terrified to be anywhere
near those bulls. Oh! They're coming right
towards us. Wait, no.
Go after him. Not me! Meanwhile, Bubba is somehow laughing while 3 bulls are barreling
towards him. This guy's way too chill to be running around with 3 bulls
that weigh 1,500 lbs each. ‘Bout to touch him
right on the head. He's adopting a strategy of
scaring the bulls away? This is hard! Note to self: don't do these things
with professionals. He literally breezed through
this challenge. - Woah, he did it!
- There you go. You won! - Congrats on winning $50,000!
- Thank you. What're you gonna spend
the money on? Probably
a new truck. Why am I not
surprised? But what will surprise you is who
wins the race later in this video. But this next challenge has
2 creatures built to shatter every bone
in your body. Alright, Nick. Come through
these doors. I'm terrified. This is Nick, who you might remember from his race
against the fastest man on the planet where, even with a mile headstart,
he still lost to Noah Lyles. And today, I'm gonna be giving him
a second chance at something
a little more deadly. In front of you. Just— I can't, bro.
I can't touch, bro. - Trust me.
- No, no. In front of you… - Bro…
- Bro, bro— When you see this footage, you're
gonna realize how dumb you're being. - What is it, bro? Ok?
- It's literally $100,000. Ok. He lost against Noah Lyles,
so he's not— he doesn't know what large sums of
money feels like. I did. To win this
$100,000, you must choose to survive 1 minute
in the ring with either— Take off your
blindfold. Ramy, a 500-lb professional
sumo wrestler… Why are you doing—
Why is he doing the… Or… Turn around. A minute in the ring
with this bear. Oh my God—
Bruh, yo! Ok. Why is he there? And if you think that
this bear is harmless… don't. Because he can literally tear
an average human to shreds. Thing’s big, bro. Tom, how you doing? He's— Ok, don't look at
him too long. It's time for a decision.
$100,000 on the line. You want to wrestle a sumo wrestler
or a grizzly bear? Oh, he's coming towards you.
He's excited. It's mobile now. Ok, I'm not going back to the bear.
He's up. Jesus. Alright.
Let's go with you, bro. You're picking him? I mean, I have to. What do you mean?
It's a big grizzly bear. You have your life insurance
with you? I don't. And so Nick doesn't
literally die, I brought an actual sumo coach
to suit him up for the match. See if you can bend your knees.
Slide your feet. Are you ready? Step in the ring! Come on. You're good.
Come here. Come to the middle. In order to win this
challenge Nick, you'll have to wrestle Ramy
for 1 minute without crossing over
the red circle. If you get pushed outside of
the circle before the minute is over, you will once again
lose everything. Touch your fist to the ground
to begin the match. Are you mentally stable? You're in too deep now, Nick.
Let's do this. Oh my God… Did you hear that? Bro, he's making sounds
worse than Tom! - Nick, touch the ground.
- Wait up! Wait up. Touch the ground, Nick! Go! Ok, alright.
Ok, ok. Alright, the timer's off. - Fight back, Nick.
- Wait, one second. Nick! Fight back, Nick! Fight back! Go for his belt, Nick! Nick! He’s suffocating me! He's toying with him.
It's nothing but a game. Nick, you made it
15 seconds. Are you just hugging him?
What're you doing? 20 seconds! Nick, you're almost
halfway done. Nick! No!
Fight back, Nick. Nick, fight back!
Fight back, Nick! 20 seconds! Nick! You’ve almost
won the money, Nick! Oh my God, he's toying with him.
It's a photo finish. 5 seconds! 3, 2, 1… He went over
the line. Are you good? You literally grabbed the side and
reached out before the minute ended. Bro, this guy's an animal
looking like a human. You lost to the fastest man
on earth. You've now lost to the best
sumo wrestler on Earth. I feel bad.
So… I'm gonna give him $10,000
for winning! Loser. Whoa! That's crazy. - Loser. Loser.
- I want to see you outside. I say we jump into what might
literally be the biggest challenge
of this entire video. And to lighten things up, I decided
to bring out comedian Trevor Wallace. Trevor, take off
your blindfold! Are we gonna address
the elephant in the room? This elephant is the best painting
elephant on the planet. Which is exactly why,
for our next challenge, we'll be doing
a paint-off. Both of you will have 10 minutes to
paint whatever creation you want. Whichever one of you draws
a better painting will have your masterpiece hung up in
an actual art museum. May the best— May the best elephant win. Hey, stop eating grass! If you don't want to mow your lawn,
just buy an elephant. Oh. She just smacked me
with her ear. She's trying to paint.
Here, give us a second. She needs a head start. Go ahead and go to your painting.
She can't wait to start. 3, 2, 1… Start the timer! This is the first time ever
on this channel that we've had
an elephant paint, so we're gonna hide the artwork
until the end. Paint?
Oh, not me. Jimmy, what do you want me
to paint? A giant school. I got you. Ok, so we're going to start with
a nice yellow, copper tone. That's the color you're
going with? Dude, what colors
are schools? Oh. There we go. Oh, she dropped it. We'll give her some
motivation. Orange. How come the elephant gets fed,
and you guys aren't feeding me? No Feastables,
no nothing? Can we get some
Feastables? Less talking, more painting.
Eat this. I hope it’s not chocolate.
I'm allergic. Huh? Alright. 5 minutes
left, Trevor. Yes, yes! Can I get my
Bob Ross wig? He's locking in. Bob Floss right here. Let's clutch up.
Let's go. We can't lose to
this guy. Oh, yes!
Good girl! - How much time do I have?
- Uh, 4 minutes. Hey, time's ticking,
Bob Ross. Yeah. Right now, that is
a yellow blob. No, no.
It's a G-Wagon. Look at that! Alright, go!
Paint! Oh! Not me.
Paint that thing. And the road,
the road. - You gotta get a sun going.
- Here, gimme yellow. Whabam!
Juilliard! We got 2 mins left so we'll clock in.
Let's lock in. You're doing great. She did not like
that paintbrush. Trevor, we’re running
out of time. - Dude, this is so bad.
- Believe in your art. These were supposed to be bricks,
not windows. I’m gonna help you out.
We're running out of time. I feel like a firefighter with
the hose. Let's go. One minute left!
We might actually win. You might actually lose
to an elephant. I feel like I'm painting at
a funeral. Now, this is her signature move
that she puts on all her artwork. - Three…
- Just keep going. - Two…
- Oh! That was a mistake. That was a fumble. One! Time is up! No! He didn’t finish! But before we judge these
works of art… Coming up, we have
a literal cheetah racing one of the fastest cars
in the world. But for now, I brought in
a professional with over 30 years of experience
to judge these paintings. And now, on
a scale 1 to 10… One being bad.
Ten being good— - Two.
- Two? - Two.
- Ok. It feels a little bit
adolescent, so maybe someone's getting in touch
with their inner child. Woah, ho-ho! Talk about the art,
not the artist! Hey! No influencing the judge. And now to reveal the masterpiece of
the world's best painting elephant… Are we really gonna grade this?
This looks like a clown threw up. She painted this
on her own. What are your
thoughts on it? I feel a lot of joy in
this particular painting, but I see that they're being
honest to who they are. You can't separate the art
from the artist. What do you rate this art piece
out of 10? I would give her
an 8 out of 10. Whoa! Trevor, you lost to
an elephant. Whatever, man. Your competitor is literally hitting
a Fortnite emote. How does that
make you feel? Alright, you're good.
Rest… Go back to
Rainforest Cafe. And as promised, here's Isla’s painting hanging
in a real art museum. Exquisite. I wonder if any of
these people realize this was painted by
an elephant. Anyway, for this
next challenge, we have the most advanced soldiers
on the planet. How long would it take you guys
to kill me? - 30 seconds.
- They're very scary men. And we're gonna see
how long they can hide in this massive junkyard
from Odin, one of the best search dogs
on the planet. How long do you think
they’ll last? Probably about 5 minutes. And if any of you can evade
these dogs until morning, you'll split $50,000 - Yeah!
- Let's go. Alright. 10 minutes to hide. 3, 2, 1… Go!
Have fun! While these men spent half of
their lives evading enemy capture, these dogs have been trained since
birth to seek out humans. So I will be shocked if these guys
can survive until morning. Get over to our
hiding spot here. I just gotta evade these
dogs the longest. These guys are running around
like a bunch of fools. I'm not gonna sweat. Rub up on some of these vehicles
just to get my scent. They’re all probably doing
zigzags and rubbing up against as many
vehicles as they can.  While Johnny created false flags
by rubbing up against cars. Carlos— I found some water! decided to mask
his scent. Here we go! He literally dunked himself in
the river hoping to throw them off. Now I’m going back to
my hiding spot. Most of these guys had
the same strategy. Create a diversion for the dog,
then hide in a car. Gotta find the right spot. While one of them had
a different idea. Hey, what's up? So I'm sitting up
in a tree about 50 ft up. And the only tree in-play. Here's the whole yard where
everybody's hiding. I just pray that God will hide
my scent. Hopefully they
don’t find me. The 10 minute timer is up!
We're coming to find you. Here they go.
You can hear the dog. 3, 2, 1… Release the hounds! - And they were off. Let's go.
- Alright, we're good? Yep. Watch the dog
and his behavior. You'll see it when he
catches that odor. You’ll see his nose
goes up. How can dogs smell
this good? It's called their olfactors. The longer the snout, the more
olfactors that these dogs have. It’s nice and windy up here so
they shouldn’t be able to smell me. I know it’s a win for me because
I’m not near the ground. Remember, this is
a very large area. So the dog has to systematically
decipher what odor is a person. And what's just somebody who
walked through here earlier. Alert! Alright. Standby. Sage might’ve found
something. Oh, the doors are
unlocked. Yo! - They got me.
- You're the first one found. Oh my God. The dog’s barking over there,
so they must’ve found somebody. Yo! That's crazy. Sage might’ve scanned
4— 500 cars. This is the only car that Sage
barked at, and he was in it! If it makes you
feel better, everyone who gets found is getting
a Lenovo Legion Pro 7i powered by Intel Core
ultra 9. These laptops are beasts, but we still got 4 more people
we need to find. Let's keep going. On our Lenovo Legion laptop
powered by Intel, we have a map of
the junkyard. We're gonna search
over there. Go over to the bus,
see if we find someone. - If not, rendezvous up.
- Yep. Ok, we got
a game plan. They’re coming my way,
so I gotta kill the light. Oh, he's on the hunt. I’m gonna call an alert
on this van! Oh, wait. Sage is barking
at this car. Sage, is it this one? Step back. Alright, is anyone
inside— - Oh!
- You got me. You could’ve just
opened the door. Two down.
Sage is crushing! I'm sorry, but you've lost
$50,000. But don't worry, you'll be able to overcome any
obstacle with this brand new laptop. That's the power of Lenovo
with Intel inside. Nice. Thank you. Alright. Let's keep
hunting, Byron. Alright, #2 has been found,
which was close to me, which could throw
the dog off. I mean he may not find me because
he just found somebody close to me. The dogs came super close
to finding the marine. Becky and Sage just
walked by. Oh my gosh, they walked
beside the car. Didn’t find him.
Holy cow! But then something completely
unexpected happened. I don't know how they did it, but somehow the dogs could not find
these guys. One of the guys threw
a Redbull can in here. What we have here is
a false find. Somebody came here
and has left. Their trap worked. Thank you, Lenovo and Intel,
for giving us these computers. And if you guys are interested in
buying one for yourselves, just go to this website right here
or click the link in the description. Even after searching for hours,
it was like the soldiers disappeared. The dogs have been looking all night,
and now the sun is coming up. We can't find these
people. It’s 5:30 in
the morning. It's obviously getting
lighter out. There's about 3 of us
still out here. But then, mere moments before
we ended the challenge… Alright, they’re really close
right now. Is he in there? Is there anybody
in this truck? - Someone’s in the back!
- We got somebody! Got me. You might be
a little hungry. I actually got you a Feastables
Peanut Butter Cup. Let me know what you think. Oh yeah. That's a 10
right there. Come on. And with the time
finally up, the 2 winners emerged from
their hiding spots. It's a good one. Oh, that was
a long night. Congrats to them on
splitting $50,000. And now, the moment you've
all been waiting for. After the most insane
man vs. animal competitions, it all comes down to
this final challenge. This cheetah is gonna race
the fastest car on earth. Let's see who wins—
Oh, cheetah! Alright, I'll get it
to come back. This cheetah reigns as the literal
fastest land animal on the planet. Clocking speeds
so intense, that humans need the speed of
a Formula E race car to stand a chance. Which is exactly why I brought not
just 1 but 3 cars to try and beat it. All starting with
this golf cart vs. cheetah. Oh, look at that thing. Ready boys? - Let's do this.
- Yup! 3, 2, 1… Send the cheetah! Oh my God,
it's so fast! Oh, it's not even
close. It's crushing us. We’re getting left
in the dust! I can't even see it anymore,
it's gone. The cheetah literally
already finished, and we're still halfway
through the race. This is embarrassing. Sir! Cheetah, you didn't even give us
a fighting chance. We need something faster.
Bring out the next car! We all knew a golf cart wasn't going
to beat this cheetah. But for this next race,
I spared no expense in acquiring one of the most
beautiful cars in automotive history. Minivan vs. cheetah. Go! Oh, here we go. - Go, Jimmy! Drive!
- Oh, what is this acceleration? - You gotta speed up faster!
- What're you doing? I have literally gas
all the way to the floor. It is gone! This thing does not
accelerate. Why’d we choose
a minivan? This is embarrassing. We already lost. What are we doing? Wait, cheetah! Cheetah! You're supposed to cross
the finish line. The cheetah stopped conveniently
right before. Oh, there it is. It's teasing us. I guess that's what can happen when
you work with animals. - It felt sorry for us.
- Yeah. But before this cheetah races
a Formula E car, we need to prevent it
from overheating. Which meant we somehow
got to do this. I wanted to say hi
to the cheetah. I'm good, thanks. - Millie— I touched the cheetah.
- Oh my God, bro. For whatever reason, they actually let us hang out
with this apex predator. I can't believe we're just
next to this right now. Come here, Millie. I can't believe I'm literally calling
a cheetah over to me. It is so big. Give it a pet, Nolan. Nolan, stop touching it.
It did not like when you touched it. You guys are actually crazy. Oh my gosh, this cheetah's literally
exactly like a giant cat. You’re so cute! We're giving the cheetah a little bit
of a break in between the race, that way it's not too
out of breath. And in case you guys
are curious, we partnered with
the American Humane Society, which is basically making sure
that all the animals are being ethically treated
while we're filming this video. That's because today there are less
than 8,000 cheetahs living on earth, which is why it's important to me
that all of these endangered animals are treated very carefully
on our set. It's so soft! The cheetah is purring
insanely loud. That means it
likes us. It looks like Millie is ready for
the next race. Let's get this on
the road. It's finally time for the moment
we've all been waiting for. What you're about to witness is the
ultimate showdown of man vs. animal. This race is so monumental,
in fact, that if anyone is going to ruin it,
it might as well be Nolan. Let's answer the most important
question in modern history… - Three!
- Can a cheetah…. - Two!
- …outrace a Formula E car? One! Let's find out. Go! That was so fast. The car just flew past
the cheetah! Oh my God! Although Millie
didn't win, it is crazy to me that
a cheetah can hold its own against the same car used in
the Formula E World Championship. But when the first car was made
more than a century ago, over 100,000 cheetahs were
alive in the wild. But today with less than
8,000 remaining, it's our job to protect these extraordinary
creatures from extinction, so that they can keep inspiring us
all to push beyond our limits. Millie is like the sweetest animal
I've ever met."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe_ejTiIcSs,"Lose 100 LBs, Win $250,000!",2209,20250621,en,"This is my friend Majd. And if he loses 100 pounds
in the next year, I will give him $250,000. This is Majd’s new home, and he'll have his own
personal gym, unlimited healthy food, and everything else he needs
to lose 100 pounds. This is actually crazy. But Majd,
there is a catch. If you step on this red line before
you lose 100 pounds, the challenge ends,
and you get nothing. If he actually loses 100 pounds, this will be the craziest
transformation ever. This is my home for the next year.
This is actually insane. See that?
That’s my gym! 250K… that's the goal. Anything you need to lose 100 pounds,
you literally have it here. This is the longest challenge
we’ve ever done. This might be one of the longest
challenges ever done. And I didn't know it yet, but the journey Majd would experience
in this video was unlike anything
we've ever captured. It will go down as one of
the most powerful stories we've ever shared on
this channel. Honestly, I'm super excited.
364 more days. I’ll see you guys tomorrow. Good morning.
It’s day two. What do I want
for breakfast? Ooh, you know what?
Could make an omelet. Going from PB and J's,
energy drinks… to this! First breakfast of many. All right, well…
I guess I better start working out. One… He just started working out and
I think he's already going to bed. I think it's hitting him just how
hard this is gonna be. Which is why we got him a trainer.
I'm gonna go introduce ‘em. This is your personal trainer,
Coach Wall. - You're about to get me shredded?
- Yes, sir. - About to lose this belly?
- Yep. I can't wait to see this man
skinny and jacked. Come on! One of the most exciting things
about this video, is right now, Majd doesn’t even
know how to squat. By the end of this video,
he's gonna be a machine. Sit your butt down toward your heels.
Drive back up. I might poop myself
doing that, brah. How much do you think your life will
change once you lose this 100 pounds? I'll just be happier.
Longevity of life. You know, being able to be
with my fam. My niece and nephew,
that's really the most important, so. The beginning of Majd’s
fitness journey was off to
an incredible start. He stayed active
every single day. …Five. Good.
Come on! But since we were only weighing him
once a month, he didn't even know how much
progress he had made. 100 pounds is tough. I don't even know if I've lost
any weight yet. But Coach was teaching him
how to eat healthy for the first time
in his life. Coach cooking today.
He teaching me how to grill! - That's good, right?
- That's so good. The plan your trainer
laid out for you… You've been completing up to
18,000 steps per day, you've been lifting weights
5 days a week, and you're only eating
2,500 calories per day. This is life-changing, right?
I want to lose this healthily. This is what I've been eating.
This is what's been getting me full. This is the new and reformed Majd,
not the past Majd. Every day of his first month,
from the moment he woke up, Majd put everything into
losing this weight. From cooking and
eating healthy meals to doing every workout Coach
designed for him. And honestly, it was
amazing to watch. This is the face of a man
who wants it. - Fantastic job today.
- Thank you so much. Super proud of you. It has officially been 30 days since
Majd began his weight loss journey, and he has no idea how much
weight he has lost. Let's go find out. It's been a month! - Let's go!
- Yeah. How you doin', man? Oh my gosh, he's sweaty—
which is what you want to see! Means he's working hard.
It's been a month in here. And now it is time for your
first monthly weigh-in. We're gonna do this every month
until you've lost 100 pounds. Majd, when you are ready, step on the scale and
reveal how much weight you have lost! Come on! When you started this video,
you weighed 324 pounds and now… - Holy crap… Majd.
- No way. You lost 20 pounds! What!?
Yeah! That is insane! 20 pounds! - That’s insane, man. Congrats.
- Let’s go, baby! Majd, that's 20% of the total weight
you need to lose in this video. The weigh-in isn’t all I had
planned for today. What do you
got planned? Every 30 days, we're gonna be
introducing challenges where you can add money
to the prize pool. On day 1,
we tested you, and you weren't very good at
doing push-ups. So your first
challenge is: On day 60, after your
second monthly weigh-in, for every push-up you can do,
I will add $1,000 to the prize pool. So if you do 100 push-ups,
I'll give you $100,000. Wait, that's actually crazy.
That's a lot. Anyways, I'll see you for
the next weigh-in. Bye, Jimmy.
Thanks. What can we expect over the next
30 days from Majd? Over time, we're only going to
decrease his calories, increase his activity,
and up his cardio. So it's gonna get harder with him
as the video goes on. He is gonna suffer.
This is gonna get harder for him. And every 20 pounds Majd
loses moving forward, you'll be able to see
a noticeable difference in his physical appearance. I lost 20 pounds,
which is crazy. This is not like,
“Oh, I lost 20 pounds, let's go.” No, the challenge is lose
100 pounds, you know? And with Coach Wall’s help, you know,
I think we're gonna crush this. And crush it, they did. Oh, whoa!
Look at this guy! 22… 23… Majd was the definition
of determined. Gimme 25. Alongside the help of Coach and
his best friend, Chandler. Pushin' each other.
Love it. 'Cause when the opportunity
arises where, hey, Jimmy asked me
to do push-ups. You know, if I hit 50 push-ups,
I could win 50 grand. I didn't expect that. 1… 2… 3… 4… All right, first smoothie ever. Literally the first smoothie that
I have ever made in my entire life. Protein scoop… Oh, let's hope this is good. Bruh, I'm not gonna lie,
that looks pretty good. I'm just gonna do the
fruit bowl from now on. It was obvious that just doing
push-ups every day wasn't going to keep Majd on pace
to lose his weight. So as you might
have guessed, Coach was there by his side
day in and day out, helping him
push the bar. - What's up, chat?
- How you doing? What up, big dawg? What a day, man.
I'm almost done here. - You're almost done.
- Holy— Sorry, bro. Come here, man. Every single morning.
Make breakfast. I’ll walk my track.
I'll play basketball. I know, like,
a lot of it's the same. It's literally how
my days have been. This is it, bro.
I'm really doin' it! And I love it,
I’m so grateful for it. I like how much you're having to
pull-up your pants. That means we’re on
the right track. Yeah, I hit 15k steps yesterday. - 15?
- That's what we do here. Let's go. Steak, egg,
and cheese today. Every day it’s looking
better, right? Every single day.
Unbelievable. Now, pushing your body to its limits
every single day isn't healthy. So we made sure Majd
took rest days and got weekly checkups from a doctor
monitoring his progress. You're healthy, doing great.
Your stamina's improved. So I think you should continue with
the weight loss that you're doing. That's awesome.
Thank you so much, doctor. I just gotta make
my basketball shots, do 20 push-ups,
and 20 minutes on elliptical. Should be a breeze. But even after rest days, Majd was
still just locked in as ever. I have a goal that I wake up
every morning and I go to. Every morning,
I choose to win. I believe in myself.
I believe in myself to the highest. There's not a doubt in my mind where
I can't achieve something that, you know,
I'm putting into my mind. Good work this week. This might be
the best week yet. Your gains, the increases
and everything. Let's just say push-ups have gotten
significantly easier. We're now on day 50,
and I brought Majd a special present. - Majd!
- What up, baby? You've been killing it
in here. You've been following your diet,
working out consistently, and walking more than
5 miles a day. And to celebrate,
I brought you a gift. Get outta here. Brand new clothes! You have lost so
much weight, we got you clothes that is
one size smaller. One size smaller
than this? Let's see if it fits. Oh, yeah. What do you think?
Does it fit? Yeah! Ok. Next step is extra large,
then large, then a medium. Wait— - You’re on the path, man. Congrats.
- Let’s go! Don't pick me up—
Oh God, don’t pick me up. In 10 days is your next weigh-in and
the push-up challenge. - You ready?
- I'm ready, man. - I'll see ya then.
- See ya, Jimmy. Please don't win too much
money on the push-ups… This guy doesn’t know I’m about to
take all his cash. Which at this point,
Majd was already on pace to win at least
another $20,000. Dude. Good work
today, man. Proud of you for
that 2XL, baby. - Thanks, man.
- Yeah. Graduated! Having dropped a whole clothes size
gave Majd a huge confidence booster. - How's that 2X feeling?
- Good. - Yeah. You look great in it, man.
- Thanks. Dude, I'm really proud of you.
This is a big step. Although maybe now he had
too much confidence. Over the course of
the next few days, Majd seemed to have lost
a lot of interest in keeping up with
his goals. I'm not lookin' forward to
this right now. Yeah, this sucks. Maybe it was because Coach
wasn’t there… Coach is not gonna be in for
training session today. Or the weather… Bro, it's actually snowing! Majd was just simply
not being himself. I am tired. But then we unfortunately realized
just exactly what was bringing him down. So one year ago,
I found out my dad passed away. One whole year ago,
my life was changed. Like I lost, like X amount of pounds.
I FaceTimed my dad. He's congratulating me and telling me
“Oh, you look great,” you know? When you lose a parent,
especially just losing someone close, like, it's gonna take
a toll on you. Went from almost 270 back to 324
in a matter of months. I'm just so proud of myself
to see how far I've come. I'm not lettin’ him down. He's with me.
He's watching. Luckily, Coach was there for him
in more ways than just fitness… I love you too, Dad. …and was beginning to have
a profound impact on his life. Good man.
Made a good son. Thanks, Coach. - Yeah, brother.
- For real. I got you. Thanks for sharing
that with me. It looked like Majd had found
strength to keep pushing after all. It has been over two months since
we started this challenge, and I have a surprise for
Majd after his weigh-in. - Jimmy!
- All right. - It's game time, baby.
- What up? - Before we get into these push-ups…
- Let’s go! - How much do you weigh?
- I don't know. - Let's find out.
- Come on! It has been over 2 months. Last weigh-in,
you weighed 303 pounds. And now, Majd weighs… Oh my gosh. I wanna see. 286 pounds! Yeah! Since the beginning of
this challenge, you've lost 38% of
your total goal weight. Wait, where are you going? Majd! Come on! I'm gonna interpret that as,
he's very happy right now. Come on! Push-up challenge! As promised, Majd,
every push-up you do, I will add $1,000 to
your prize pool. Get in position. On the first day of
this challenge, you weren't exactly
the best at push-ups. - How many can you do now?
- Let's find out. When you're ready… $1,000… $2,000… $3,000… $4,000… $5,000—
Majd, you’re getting rich. $11,000… $12,000—
Yo, this is crazy. - $18,000—
- 19! - $19,000—
- 20! All right, you're up to
20 grand. Oh, yeah.
I’m here. How many more do you have
in you? I got some, bruh.
I got some— Got more in you?
Majd, look at this right here. This could go in
your bank account. Let's go. 25, 26, 27, 28… 29. 30 grand!
I believe in you. 31. 32— 32? Ah! 31 push-ups,
aka $31,000, will be added to
your prize pool. Look how red
his eyes were. Bro, you just
pushed yourself. I'm very proud of
you, man. You're becoming healthier,
you're losing weight, and have now over 2-X'd your
push-ups since being in here. You should be really
proud of yourself. Thanks, Jimmy.
For real, thank you. And follow me to find out what
your next challenge is. Oh my gosh. - Wait, why are we going outside?
- Uh, you'll see. Your next challenge: every $1 you can
carry for a lap around this building, I will add it to
your prize pool. Ok. That doesn’t sound
too hard. Well, it depends.
You might get greedy. And you might try to carry
$500,000, but you can't make it all the way
through, and then you lose. That's a lot of thinking. And to top this day off,
which I would say's been pretty good, I have one final surprise. Come on inside and
come see your family. Mom! No way! Oh, no way! My mom, my sister,
my brother-in-law, Dani! Have fun with
your family. They can stay here
as long as they want. - No way!
- Yup. Mom— you guys
are here! And over the next
few days, Majd's family did
everything they could to support him in
his weight loss journey, like cleaning the gym and preparing meals so that he could train for
the money walk challenge. The big focus right now is just
to get your grip strength up and the endurance. Coach wants me to emulate
how it would be for me to carry duffel bags
full of money. Keep in mind, too,
the faster you walk, the faster it's gonna be done. We're also working back
your shoulders, your upper back. The main goal with this is we're
gonna be building up your strength to be able to
do some work. And with Majd progressing so
much in his workouts, Coach's incredible impact on
his life was so great, he became a member
of the family. [singing “Happy Birthday” in Arabic] Thank you so much.
You do a great job! And with his family visit
coming to an end… Bye, mom. And me being halfway around the world
shooting another video… For the next few weeks,
Coach and Majd's connection would only grow
even stronger. You have one new message. Yo, my man. This is so cool,
we get to do this together and form this deep friendship.
Man, you rock. The way I've come to know you over
these past couple months, man. It’s like, you're just a very kind,
caring, compassionate human being. You're gonna positively influence
millions of people. I haven't thought that far. I don't know why I got this
idea in my head. What was that like,
jumping in that money? All right, your turn,
Coach. Yeah, I don’t know if
I want to get out of here. - What up, man?
- Yo. It’s ya boy, Coach. Who this? And because their bond
was so powerful, what came next was the worst thing
that's ever happened in one of
my videos. And because I was still out
of the country, one of my producers had to
break the news. - Yo!
- Yo! - Hey, how's it going?
- Will, right? Yeah. How you doin'? - Are you tellin' me I'm fired?
- No. This is bad. No, I wish that’s what I was
telling you, I'll be honest. Um… but I do have
really unfortunate news. I hate to be the person to
tell you this, uh… Coach Wall was found dead in
his apartment yesterday. No. No… No, man. No. No, don’t lie to me, bro! No, that’s not something
I would joke about. Oh my God…. Oh, no… No, this has gotta be a joke, bro.
There’s no way… Bro, there’s no way… Over the next
few days, visitors poured in to help Majd
process his grief while he contemplated the decision of
continuing or stopping this video. Because ultimately, whether or not
this video continues was up to him. You know, both times
I experienced a loss… it's snowing outside. Yo, my man! This is so cool
we get to do this together. —so cool we get to
do this together. Coach? I look at
the door and… I just hope he
walks through. Coach was side-by-side
with me. And now,
he isn't here. He was a good dude. And he spoke very highly of you.
And he believes in you, man. The moment I arrived back in the US,
I went to see Majd. And I'm choosing not to play our
conversation here, but essentially, I wanted to let him know
that his grief was real and that we could end the video
right then and there if he didn't want to continue. - We're not pullin' the plug on this.
- Yeah? I can't let him down. I'm doing this for myself,
and now it’s for Coach, too. To honor his mentor and friend,
Coach Wall, Majd refused to take on another
trainer for his next challenge. And in the days leading up to
the money walk, he gave every ounce of strength
he had in every single workout. This is exactly why I thought that
for Majd’s next milestone, it was only fitting that I give him
something to honor his dear friend. Before we do
the day 100 challenge, I wanted to give you something
a little special that you can put up
on the wall. Oh, man. Incredible human being. I'm so grateful that I got to,
you know, spend time with him. Where do you want to put up
your wall plaque? Literally right at the door. Coach! How are ya? Just looking up
at this, it’s just gonna be my motivation
moving forward. - Thanks, Jimmy.
- No problem. Let's go weigh in and
see how much weight Majd has lost. One hundred days ago,
Majd weighed 324 pounds. And now…
let's see what he weighs. You've lost over 50 pounds! Yeah! Meaning, Majd is officially
halfway through the challenge! Only one thing
left to do! Let's see how much money
Majd can carry. We have $100,000
that you could win. That was not supposed to fall. Remember, you can carry as
much or as little as you want, but if you drop any of it,
you walk away with nothing. Ok. How's it feel? It feels good. I mean,
it feels pretty light. He’s now got 15 grand. One more?
Ok, one more. This one on my arm. All right, that's $40,000.
We pushin’ for 50? Nah. $40,000. - This is all for Coach Wall.
- Come on. When you're ready,
cross the start line. Let's do it. - Let's go, man.
- All right, he's off. Come on, Majd,
you got this. All right, he's cooking Bro, he is running
with that thing! $40,000. Don't pass out on us. Claw! Chandler, don't let him
touch the red line. I'll push you over
before that happens. For Coach Wall! Quarter of
the way done. If a single bag, a single dollar,
touches the pavement… Dollar! you lose all 40 grand. Wait, are the bags closed? - Yeah?
- Most of em'. No! Hey, you need a break?
You can just put the money down. - No. No break.
- Yeah, yeah. Keep going. Three quarters of the way. I feel pretty tired! Are you gonna pass out? You’re almost there!
Less than 10 steps! Cross it! He did it! Your prize pool has now
increased to $321,000. Let’s go! Time to make it rain, baby! Adding it to the pot. Yeah! Do you remember on day 1,
how long it took you to run a mile? 17:01… One mile. Dang. For our next challenge, if you can do a mile in under
8 minutes and 30 seconds, aka, half of your
one mile time, I'll add another $25,000 to
your prize pool. I'll see ya in 30 days. You have
a lot of time you need to shave off. Bro, 8 minutes and 30 seconds
sounds easy, but that's hard. We’re gonna get through it, though.
We’re gonna give it our all. Majd started training immediately. I have to get
a baseline today. I'm gonna find out how long it takes
for you to run a mile. The challenge is
8 minutes and 30 seconds. We're aiming for anywhere around
like a 10 minute, 11 minute mile. I’m done. Good Lord. Oh, damn. I just ran my first mile,
12 minutes and 50 seconds. My legs are on fire. Means I have to shave
5 minutes. It’s gonna be tough. This is strictly cardio, something
that I only do 2 times a week. And the cardio that I do
2 times a week isn't even this. Majd looked like
he was struggling, so I thought I'd check in to share
something that might help. When Shopify heard about
your weight loss journey, they decided they wanted
to help out. Inside is a bunch of gear to help you
train to get under 8.5 minutes. Actual running shoes,
more supplements, an actual track suit, better clothes,
better gear. Here's some balls.
Do you get the point? This thing is loaded with things
to help get your mile time down. And they're all from businesses
built on Shopify. Thanks, Shopify! Your race is in 20 days. Shopify, me, and millions of people
are rooting for you. - Let's go!
- Get that time under 8.5 minutes! Majd wasted no time in running with
his new gear and he even had
some other ideas. Let's go! Come on, man.
You got this! Don't let me beat you. The mile’s ours! I'm honestly not sure if
that helped, but Majd seemed more
fired up than ever. And we were all starting to see
a difference in him. - Majd-eroni!
- What up, baby! I noticed something,
your clothes are a little baggy. Wait! No way. Yeah, put the banana down. We got you clothes
one size smaller. When Majd started this video,
he was a three XL. When you put these on,
you'll officially be just an XL. Damn! Congrats.
10 days. We'll see if you can
do the mile. Majd wasted no time in
getting to work. And other than yelling across
to our prison set where a cop and a criminal
are trapped together, - Hey, yo!
- Yo! He completely locked in. But his victory was
far from guaranteed. - It’s day 130!
- Come on man! Come on! Are you ready? Yeah! Think I gotta change… This is the first time in 130 days
I've seen him not in a white shirt. When we started this video,
it took you 17 minutes to run a mile. And now,
130 days later. You must do it in under
8 minutes and 30 seconds. Are you ready? Come on! 3, 2, 1… Go! 25 grand on the line. Let's see if
he can do it. Let's go! One out of seven
laps down. Majd is flying through his
second lap. It's amazing to see how far he's come
in only 130 days. When Majd didn't know where to start
his weight loss journey, I helped him just like Shopify
helps entrepreneurs when they don't know how to start
a brand new business. Remember at the
start of this video when you didn't know how to begin
your weight loss journey? Absolutely. That's how it can feel for
brand new entrepreneurs and exactly why Shopify exists
to help them start their businesses. Don't quit on us!
Let's go! Shopify literally helped me launch
Feastables with an online business. I had no idea how to set up a store,
fulfill orders, but thanks to Shopify,
we've sold millions of bars. Water, water!
Go! Ah, thanks! Hurry up, Majd!
You're running out of time! There's only
2 minutes remaining. His pacing has slowed down
tremendously. We don't have enough time.
We have to run with him. Last lap!
Majd dig deep! We’re coming with you! To those of you
watching at home, go start the business that
you've been dreaming of. Go to Shopify.com/MrBeast. Starting an online business.
It's easier than you think. You're almost there! Come on! Go! Let's go! I can’t believe it! Majd you did it in
8 minutes and 4 seconds. Congrats, Majd! Thanks Jimmy! You show up for me,
I show up for you! - Who’d you show up for?
- Coach Wall. He shows up for me every day.
I show up for him every day. Congrats on 25 grand! But more importantly, let's go see
how much weight you’ve lost. Come on! Turn off the lights! On day 1, he weighed
324 pounds. On day 30, he weighed
303 pounds. On day 60, he weighed
286 pounds. On day 100, he weighed
271 pounds. And now,
reveal his weight! That’s 71 pounds since the start! All right. Ok, don’t hurt him! Maybe at the end of the video,
we'll lift you up. When you started, you were able to
dead hang for 6 seconds. In exactly 30 days,
for every second you can hang, I will give you $1,000. Get out of here. And truthfully, because your
hang time was… …awful. I brought someone who
literally trains bodybuilders. This guy has a degree
in biochemistry and is the smartest fitness
influencer I could find, Jeff Nippard. Let's go! All right, he just did
the whole mile thing. He's on adrenaline. I personally think you can do
a pull-up. I wanted to do a pull-up
my whole entire life. Just one single pull-up. If you can do it,
I'll throw in an extra 10K. - No way.
- I got you. In 30 days? Wait Majd, you can win
a lot of money. These next 30 days
are important. Yeah, they are.
They're crucial. And to celebrate
crushing the mile, Majd and Jeff sat down to share
a little something special. - The Feastables cups!
- Let's go. This is something that I really
wanted to have. You deserve it.
You earned it. This is a big moment for me, guys. Cheers, brother. That's some good stuff. This peanut butter is like
real peanut butter. Right?
So good. It was clear that in order to
dead hang for a minute, let alone do
a singular pull-up, Majd would have to alter his
training plan significantly to focus on
upper-body strength. - Take your grip.
- Ok. And then this is gonna really
kinda shoot you up. Does that make sense? So it's giving you
a lot of assistance. Ok. Jeff! I'm so sorry. The main goal for me
is to finish this, lose the 100 pounds, and just make sure that the world can
hopefully see Coach's impact. I'm crushing dead hang! In only 3 days, Jeff really helped
Majd improve his dead hang, which was not looking good
for my bank account. This guy is an animal. Do you wanna guess
what it was? It’s probably like
37 seconds. 45? No way. It’s not even the end
of the first week! Let's go! With Majd now
set up for success, Jeff left it up to him to prepare
over the next 27 days. This is where the real challenge
starts, right? Now I’m all alone. On his own now, Majd was really
starting to see his body improve. I can feel these chisels. He started locking in on everything,
from his workouts… You saw that? Eating only
1800 calories a day… We just switched over to
1800 calories. And even having a strict
sleeping schedule. 10 o’clock food cut-off,
sleep by 12. So for the remainder of training for
the dead hang challenge, Majd really was set up
for success. Chalked up. I gotta do 3 sets of dead hangs,
10 to 20 seconds Every single day,
he improved his hang time. Day of the challenge,
when it comes down to it… we’re going till like,
my thumbs actually fall off. I'm so close! It really just
goes to show that when you put your mind
to something, anything is possible. Doing pull-ups, running miles in
under 8 minutes and 30 seconds, carryin' a bunch of money around,
doing 40 pushups straight. Such an incredible story. Game day tomorrow, baby! Day 161.
Let's see how Majd is doing. Drive! Why’s it stuck?
Bro, I’m literally flooring it. Majd! - It’s weigh-in day!
- What the— I think you
broke the door. Bro! It's the big day!
Are you ready? - Uh yeah, I'm ready, man.
- This is gonna be awesome. To kick things off, we're gonna see
how much you weigh. My theory is you're actually pretty
close to finishing the challenge. I feel like it. And then second, we're gonna
dangle you 100 feet in the air. What? And every second you hang,
you win $1,000. Ok. Hold on. - Dangled from a crane?
- Hey! Don't worry about it. - Let's weigh in.
- Oh, man. What do you think that
number will say? 246. Majd has done
10,000 steps a day. Followed his diet perfectly. Not skipped a single rep on
his workouts. Hop on. Let's go! 3, 2, 1… Reveal the weight! 234 pounds! What? No way! - No! No!
- Yeah! You only have 10 more pounds to lose,
and then this video is over. If you play your
cards right, you could be out of here
in the next 30 days. Thanks, Jimmy. All right, but now
you need to lock in. Come on! Let’s go outside. Today we find out how long
I can dead hang for. I have no idea what
Jimmy has in store for me. All I know is there's a crane,
a platform, and a bar for me to
hang from. 100 feet in the sky and
$1,000 for every second you can hang. Majd, are you ready? 3, 2, 1… Here we go. All right, the time
has started. 4 seconds,
5 seconds… Hey Majd,
look down! - Oh my gosh, does that scare you?
- Not at all. Oh, my— Wait, get a shot of this.
This is real. Look at that.
15 seconds has gone by. You've already doubled
your first time. Majd has now won
$20,000. - This is light work for you, bro.
- Do not quit! You're almost there, Majd.
You're almost there, brother. You're the one that's going to
accomplish this! 30 seconds! Focus on your breath.
Don't listen to Jimmy. His hands are giving out.
His face is getting red. Don't regret this! Bro, do you think I'm not
watching you? 40 seconds! I got eyes on you
at all times. Keep pushing.
Don't stop. 50 seconds! You don't have to follow
your diet plan. You don't have to stay inside
this red circle. You don't need to do
anything. You don't even need to do this,
but you're choosing to do this. Let's go, Majd! Your prize pool's now 400 grand.
His arms are shaking. You're almost there. I can't open
my eyes. 60 seconds! The hardest part of
all this, obviously, is the connection that
I had with Coach. It sucks that, like,
it was so close. Oh, he just dropped. A minute! It was—
Oh my God. The entire platform. 6 seconds to
60 seconds. That's 10X! Hello?
That's $60,000! - I'm so proud of you, man.
- Let’s go, man! You officially made it
a minute and one second. Let's go! But we're not stopping there.
Because as you'll remember… If he could do a pull-up,
I'd throw in an extra 10K. Let's go, man. - You ready?
- I'm ready. Big breath. And then you're gonna drive as
hard as you can, chest to the bar. Let's go! Let's go! Can you do another one? Wait, 3. Wait, he doesn’t
need help! Let’s go! No way! Let's go fill up
the prize pool. I've never seen Majd
this happy before. I told you I was gonna
break the bank today! There we go. $71,000 has now been added
to the prize pool. What the heck? I know you're on cloud nine.
Arguably the best day of your life. But I do have to give
some bad news. That was the final challenge. No, losing 100 pounds was
the final challenge. Ok, yes, but that's the final
micro-challenge. - Ok.
- So… - We'll start weighing you every day.
- Let's go! And when you officially lose the next
10 pounds, video's over. All right.
Good luck, man. Thanks, Jimmy. Majd has only 10 pounds
left to lose. So at this point,
it had become clear that he was on track to hit his goal
weight within the next month. So it started out 250,000.
Now it's at 417,000. It was actually insane. Now that it's my final 10 pounds,
we are coming to an end man. These may be my last
few weeks in here. It's definitely
a bittersweet feeling. It's kind of crazy how far we've come
in less than 6 months. It's like I look at myself like,
who is this person? If my old self walked through
that door right there, right now, he'd be like,
""Who is this?"" I've seen the seasons change
while I've been in here. Bro! Look at that! I've been inside of a red circle,
basically away from everything. I'm just, I’m so grateful.
So thankful for the experience. Coach being the biggest impact
of this whole thing. God rest his soul. I know he'd be
proud of me. He said this one thing, ""It’s so cool that we
get to do this together."" While Coach gave Majd all the tools
he needed to lose 100 pounds, when he does finally
leave the circle, it will be up to him to apply what
he's learned to his everyday life. The journey’s
almost over— Sike. The journey’s
almost over in here. The real journey starts
on the outside. I have the clothes that I wore when
I first got in here. I'm gonna try 'em on. Let's just say…
we lost a little bit of weight. Bro, look how baggy
these are. Seeing Majd trying on his old clothes
gave me an idea. What if he could try on
his old body? This is a bodysuit that is
a 1-to-1 replica of Majd on day 1. No joke, we scanned
your body, saw exactly where you lost fat,
and created this suit. Bro, there’s no way
this is me. That's literally another
human being. - Let's put it on.
- I gotta wear this? 175 days ago,
you wore this every day. This is crazy! I wanna see myself
real quick. Oh my God! No way! This fat suit weighs exactly
97 pounds. He is now back at
his starting weight. You probably forgot what life used to
feel like. Let's do a lap. I hope this helps
you realize how much you’ve changed
throughout this video. Alright, let's try a lap. Here's footage of him actually
running a lap on day 1. If you think he's being dramatic,
go pick up 97 pounds, and you'll see, that's a lot of weight to
have on your body. There you go. You like your day 1 body,
or your day 175 body? Of course,
my day 175 body. Since we're weighing
Majd every day, we were seeing him get
closer and closer, until he was only a half a pound away
from his goal of 224 pounds. - Oh my God, dude.
- You have no idea how close you are. Wait, wait, wait.
Can I turn around? Seeing just how far Majd had come
from his old self made it pretty clear
to everyone that it was probably time to do
his final weigh in. Today could be my last day. It's crazy. 6 months.
Half a year. Today could be the day
all the hard work paid off. Or we're still half a pound away. Over these 6 months, Majd slashed his
daily caloric intake by 600 calories, decreased his fat mass
by over 50%. He also did 3,950 pushups and
made 17,600 basketball shots. And according to his doctor,
if he keeps this up, he'll have increased his lifespan
by around 5 years. But before we know if
this is his final weigh in, we have a message from Majd,
from himself. This is actually a video from
day 1. Play it. Majd, you're looking lean.
You're looking healthy. You're looking bald.
Beautiful as ever. But most importantly,
you don't wanna go back to what you're
looking at now. This is something that you never
wanna feel again. Once you break
that barrier, you continue to push on and
push through, you'll never wanna get
back to this. This is something that you're gonna
do for the rest of your life. I'm not gonna let you fall off. 100% 178 days ago. Dang, bro.
That's crazy. Majd, it's time. I gathered all your best friends,
even David Letterman. David Letterman! Yeah! He told me he's a fan of his show
so I brought him out. Good luck! This could be the
final weigh in. - Ok.
- The last time. Reveal the results! Let's go! And before he goes out
to see his family, we're gonna do something a little
different and jump forward in time to show you his
full transformation. Here it is.
After half a year. Wait… Yo! Bro! I might get married. I might get married! 178 days in
this circle. Take your hand off
your eyes. We brought your family out! Oh, I love you, mom! You know, without Coach Wall I
wouldn't have been able to do this. And he said it would be so cool that
we get to do this together. And today is that day that
we get to do this together. Thank you guys
for watching!"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTSaweR8qMI,"$1 vs $500,000 Date",1042,20250607,en,"We're going on some of the most
expensive dates in the world. Like this $500,000 date that includes the
entirety of Disneyland, all for ourselves… a $100,000 date at this mega complex with
a massive waterpark and indoor ski resort… a $50,000 private island date… Best date ever! a $10,000 date cooked by Gordon Ramsay… and we even convinced
superstar singer Madison Beer to go on a date with
my most awkward friend. All starting with this $1 date:
a Ferris Wheel! - Here's $1.
- Ok. - Ladies first.
- Thank you. Take notes, men. Is this safe? I see why it's only $1.
The $1 date has now begun. It's, uh, making a lot of noise. Why is it making that noise? It's just the wind, right? I usually film 20, 25 days a month, and I don't really get to
spend much time with my fiancee, so I literally picked this video so me and
my fiancee could spend more time together. I love you, even if you
didn't take me to Disneyland. Well… not yet. But for the final date in this video,
for the first time in history, Disney reserved
the whole park just for us. That's it for the $1 date! Let's head out to the $10,000 dinner date—
After you, babe. Turn off the park.
I'll see you guys there. And now, the $10,000 date where we're gonna be recreating
our first-ever date with sushi. - After you.
- Thank you. She doesn't know this, but Gordon Ramsay's
gonna be making us the meal for this date. Thank you. There you go.
You look really cute. I picked this just for you. It's been a long time since my first date
with Thea, and now that we're engaged, I'm really excited to explore the world's
most expensive dates with my fiancee. You're probably wondering,
""Why is this the $10,000 date?"" Why is it? Gordon Ramsay himself
is gonna be cooking our meals. The Gordon Ramsay? Yep. Come on in. Welcome to Lucky Cat Miami! It's nice meeting you! How's it going? What an amazing night
this is gonna be. Oh, I'm excited. Yes. We're gonna kick off with some pea
guacamole with some delicious crackers. Did you say peacock? I said pea guac! Oh, pea guac, oh… Not peacock, babe. To celebrate this $10,000 dinner,
some seriously exclusive sushi. Ladies first. Cheers. Yeah, this is good. We have a delicious gourmet fried chicken,
wonderful fried rice, and duck bao buns. Duck tacos? Bao buns! Duck tacos. Bao buns! You can yell at me. I will do in a minute.
You're pushin' my limits, man. Enjoy. I want you to take the first bite. I knew you were gonna do that. It's only the $10,000 date, and we already have the world's best chef
cooking a romantic dinner for the 2 of us. Nothing could possibly
ruin this moment. Chef. What are you guys
doin' here? No, no no, no. - I got you.
- Come on, man! Don't rip it! I'm not ripping it, chef!
I'm not ripping it! Oh my goodness, mate. Why are you disrespecting
his restaurant? This is supposed to be
a romantic dinner! Nolan, mine's burning. That's it.
I'm done! What are you? An idiot sandwich! That is worth 10K alone. You guys have turned it
to a nightmare! For $10,000, Gordon had a romantic
surprise for our final course. This is nice!
This is romantic! This is actually
very romantic. Aww. Thank you. This 10K date was amazing. I can't imagine how insane these dates
are gonna get later in the video. The $50,000 date is this
entire private island, so me and Thea brought some friends with
us to make this a quadruple date. Wait, what?
What is that? This is Tom,
the turkey. Please tell me we're
not eating Tom. We are not eating Tom. I didn't know if this was like a
Say-Hi-To-Your-Dinner thing as you arrive. We have this entire $50,000 island
and everything on it to ourselves. I say the best way to kick off
an island date is to go jet skiing! Let's go! Best date ever! You might recognize Grizz and Hase from the video where they spent 74 days in
the wilderness together. The day I took that hood off and saw you
was the best day of my life! And you saw these two when Josh spent
22 days in solitary confinement. These three spent weeks away
from their wives, so I thought I'd give them
some quality time together. This is the best date
we've ever been on! Does the wife approve? I approve! This is how I make good with
all the people I put in prolonged places. Oh my gosh,
that was so close! Hey, Jimmy! It’s Nolan! Yo! Uh-oh,
we're bouncin'. Nolan is flying solo for this date, but later on, he'll be going on
a date with Madison Beer. I, uh—
the great outfit… Everyone, the island is all yours.
Go do whatever you want! So we all enjoyed the luxuries of
this $50,000 island date. All right everyone,
heads up! Like hitting golf balls that are also
fish food right into the ocean. - Thea, you show me how it’s done.
- I actually don't know how to do this. Now we're getting couples' massages
on the beach. There is just a person on my back.
Very relaxing. Grizz and Hase were playing
some beach volleyball… against their wives, of course. And Josh and Kenna were having
a picnic on the beach. I forgive you for taking him away
from me for so long. - Welcome in, guys.
- Oh wait, there's rose petals. I mean, I laid those
just for you. For 50 grand, we all get these
luxurious bungalows. Where do the petals lead? I mean, look where
the petals lead. Into the lovely master suite. I made a heart just for you. It is so pretty.
And you picked them yourself? - Oh, I made this myself.
- Wow. And as the sun was setting on
this $50,000 date… To our loved one! Cheers! …Nolan was the only one
at dinner without a date. Until Tom the turkey showed up. Nolan, we found you a partner! Uh, I'm all good on Tom. And after dinner,
we did some couples dancing. Rate our dance move. Again. Got it? Come on! And after dark, we had a beach campfire,
and I had a surprise for everyone. Cue the fireworks show! And lightning at the same time! - Nolan, your date showed up!
- Tom the Turkey! Yo, why are you standin' so still? That's it for the $50,000 date!
I'll see you guys at the next one. For double the cost of
the previous date, we get this massive indoor metropolis
all to ourselves. There's a giant theme park, the largest indoor
water park in America, even its own
weather control system so they can have the largest indoor
ski slope in America. Ooh, it's so cool. This is terrifying! And while Thea loves skiing… I haven't told her… I have no idea how to ski. Babe, this is massive! You're scared?
Don’t be scared. I'm not scared. Nah. You're good. Hey, what's over there? - What?
- I'm freakin' terrified. - What did you say?
- I'm excited! Ok, you got it? Babe, grab the straight— Babe, stop! How do I stop? Babe, I'm starting to think
that you don't know how to ski. No, I—
I know how to ski. - How do I stand up?
- I got you. Ah! Oh, no. Babe, stop! Babe, help! Thea, make me stop. Ok. I got you. How do I stop? Legs together! Legs closed, legs closed! What, are they not closed? Yeah, skiing is so much fun. Anyways, let's move on with the date! With so much to explore in
this shopping metropolis, it felt like doing ten dates in one! From winning prizes in an arcade… …getting a hole-in-one
in mini golf… - Look at that!
- Yeah! …or building each other
custom teddy bears. I love it. And where I normally do these kinds of
videos by myself or with my friends, doing this with the person I love most
was kind of magical. Being able to do pretty much anything
you could ever want to do on a date— It felt like being a kid in a candy store
…literally! Ooh, chocolate. Whoa. What is this? Uh. Hey, ma'am?
What is this? They're Hershey's. Can we replace these with Feastables? Sure. Ok. Oh! Much better! If you haven’t already,
try Feastables. It's the best-tasting chocolate
on the planet. Let's keep the date going. We now have an entire waterpark
to ourselves, and we just wanna take
a relaxing swim together. Isn't it crazy that we're
in the middle of a mall? It's like as big as the ocean. Up next, we actually got Madison Beer to
go on a date with Nolan. Do you think Nolan has a chance with her? We're about to find out. For the $250,000 date,
Madison Beer, the two-time Grammy nominee,
platinum-selling artist, with over 3.5 billion streams worldwide, is going on a date with… my awkward friend Nolan. - Hello!
- Hey. - Great to meet you.
- How are you? Nice to meet you. And while Nolan is on his date with
Madison Beer, me and Tareq are currently
tucked away in the bathroom with a walkie that communicates
directly to a mic in Nolan's ear. Where are you from? - I'm from Long Island.
- New York? Yes. Where are you from? Nebraska. Not much
out there besides corn. - Cool.
- Yeah. No, he's talking about corn! In this seven years I've known Nolan,
I have never seen him this nervous before. So to help Nolan out, I spent $250,000
on Madison's dream date. From driving her favorite car,
getting VIP treatment at an MLB game, and an over-the-top sushi dinner, all to give Nolan the best shot of
securing a second date. Tell her you like her outfit. A great outfit. Thank you. We told the waiter to help us
wingman Nolan. I'll be your server.
Welcome to Bar Siesta. You guys look amazing.
I like your shoes my man. Dude, thank you. But it was quickly clear
that it wasn't working. How's the weather? How's the weather? Cool. He’s falling apart. Nolan is not used to talking
to attractive women. - You've watched the videos before?
- I watch all the videos. What's your favorite video? The one where they were underground
for 100 days. Madison Beer watches our videos. I never expected that. Same. I don't really eat meat. Vegan?
Vegetarian? Pescatarian,
'cause I love sushi. They're getting to know each other,
this is nice. - Sorry, I just got lost in your eyes.
- Aw, that's so sweet. Ohh, he hit it! He took the shot! I was staring into the abyss.
I don't… - Oh, not my eyes?
- No. As they finished eating,
I had one last idea to help Nolan. I want you to tip the waiter $10,000.
My card is in your wallet. That guy was so nice.
I think we should tip $10,000. I would love nothing more. - Nolan has a gift for you.
- We left a little something for you. Wait, are you guys serious? - Thank you.
- I appreciate it. - Here are the keys.
- Thank you. Let's hit it. Madison really loves animals, so their
next stop on their date is an animal farm. Nolan's only problem now was that
the petting zoo was an hour drive away. Me and Tareq are still listening in. What's it like going up in front of
thousands and thousands of people? I just love my fans. They're the reason I get to do
stuff like this and live my dreams. He's warming up and
he's getting better with time. We made it to the second part of the date. The Gentle Barn, a sanctuary that
rescues abused animals. What made you start loving
animals so much? I have a lot of anxiety, and I feel like
they just are a calming reminder of peace. I feel a sense of calm around you. You are smooth with it. But visiting animals wasn't the only thing
on our agenda. They're gonna give you guys $25,000, and I'm actually going to match them,
and I’m gonna give you another 25,000. And then it was time for me to ask
an important question. You two ready to head to
an Angels baseball game? - Let's do it.
- Sure am. Do you mind if me and my fiancee join you
guys for the next part of the date? Am I allowed to say no? No, 'cause I paid for it. I mean, you paid for it, right? And then we had an entire suite to
ourselves at an Angels game. This view of the game is insane. We got custom jerseys with
our names on the back. And after almost all of us
made it on the jumbotron… a crowd began forming around us. You'll be in a video, say ""Hi."" Anyways, we should probably head to
the next part of this date. And for the final part of
the $250,000 date— What are we
doing, Nolan? Sushi dinner and an ice skating rink with
some of the best sushi chefs on the earth. I can definitely say I've never
done anything like this. I gotcha, I gotcha. Thank you, Jimmy. Tonight we prepared for you all
a tasting menu. How much does this
amount of fish cost? A couple thousand. How do you think we got up to
the 250K price tag? Definitely looks like
my type of bite of sushi. Oh my God. - That is so good.
- Wow. And then we all enjoyed some of the best
sushi I've ever had in my entire life. This is the best date ever. - Thanks, Nolan.
- Anytime. The 250K date, I think we could all agree,
was a lot of fun. Nolan, you had a question
you wanted to ask. I do. Oh, God. Oh, Jesus. Oh, God. My shoe was just untied. Would you like to go on a second date to
Disneyland with me? Yes. Let's head on over! And now it is time for the most expensive
grand finale date. We have Disneyland all to ourselves! This is gonna be awesome.
Let's go ride some rides! Disney won't just hand over
their keys to anyone, but for this once-in-a-lifetime date, we were given the entire park
for one night. And with so much to do,
we had to bring the boys, our friends from the island,
and of course… Madison and Nolan. Yo, once we’re at the top,
this is gonna have a crazy view. But our first stop is this
absolutely insane Star Wars ride. All right, that's cool. Holy smokes!
Look how big this is! Normally, people can wait
hours for this ride, but my friends and I walked right in. Yo, strap in. All right, who's ready for
the Star Wars ride? Is now a bad time to mention
I haven't seen the movies? What? This is crazy!
How did Disney build all this? This is wild. Oh my Gosh. Nolan, protect Madison! Yo, can you believe we're
doing this right now? Yeah, this is insane! - That was awesome.
- Once in a lifetime! This is crazy! That was amazing! Every other cart was empty.
We have this whole place to ourselves. Disneyland is awesome! That was sick! And after that ride,
what could be cooler… …than building your own lightsaber? Oh, yeah!
Coolest lightsaber! Up next, we're all gonna ride
this giant Ferris Wheel. We're back to where
this video started. You could say it went full circle. I've never been on a Ferris Wheel
that looks like that! Yeah, this is massive! It feels like we're stepping into
an old movie. Come on in, babe. This is like the $1 date,
but in Disneyland and much bigger. Much bigger! You can see the entire
park up here. Wow! How does this compare to
our $1 date? I mean, it's so much better. It's very romantic here in Disney. Wonder what Nolan and
Madison are doing. Fist bump. Let's go. Things are not looking good for
Nolan right now. I can't wait to
play games. Yeah, that sounds fun. - Are you gonna win me something?
- Of course. Yay! Are you gonna win me something? Oh, you betcha! Let's go! With his eye on the prize,
Nolan challenged me and Chandler to a friendly competition. This is what you're
competing for. - A worm? Babe, do you want that worm?
- Yes, I really want it. Ok, boys, I'm gonna
have to win this one. - All right, I wanna win this for you.
- Please. 3, 2, 1… Go! - Nolan!
- First one, first one. Let's go! It's, like, curving. Two! That's two! You need three to win. This is the grand prize.
It's all yours. For you. You can feel the tension in
the air right now. Gah, come here! But you know I couldn't lose to
Nolan like that. Yes! Yes! Oh my goodness! Let's run it back! Yes! - Yay!
- Here y’go, babe. The Three P.
Here we go! We won again! That was fun! It's fun winning. There are no words to describe how special
it is to have Disneyland all to ourselves. And I think we all made memories
that are gonna last a lifetime. Whoa, babe.
There's a puddle. You're a gentleman! No wet feet for you. Take notes, boys. And to wrap things up,
we have one final surprise. We're gonna be eating dinner in
front of the Disney castle. - Oh my!
- What? All right, I don't know why Disney's going
all out for us, but thank you guys. - Oh my gosh.
- Wow! - This is crazy.
-This is beautiful! Everyone, come on, sit down. Cheers to the greatest date in history. Cheers! Yes! This was an awesome night.
I'm glad I can enjoy it with all of you. Cheers! Of all the dates I took you on,
which one was your favorite? Definitely this one. Yeah? Yeah, ‘cause everybody's here.
We should do this more! Rent all of Disneyland? Yeah. That was awesome. And to wrap up the video,
for the first time in Disney's history, they're going to do a private parade
for all of us. Let's head on over. I gotta say, this date is gonna be
so hard to top. Huge thanks to Disney for absolutely
blowing our minds with this experience. This was truly a once in a lifetime. If you don't have notifications on,

can beat him in a 1V1, I'm gonna give him
half a million dollars. I also got the greatest shooter
in basketball, the strongest hitter
in baseball, That is gone! and the most famous athletes on the planet
all competing against normal people. Starting with Serena Williams, the greatest female tennis player
to ever live. And she will be competing against… Bring ‘em on in! …these four quadruplets. Hi. Oh my goodness. If one of you can return a serve
from Serena Williams, I will give you guys $100,000. But if you can't, we'll be donating it
to a charity of her choice. You girls can do it. - We got this.
- Easy! Alright, it's now time. Here we go. Serena Williams serves a tennis ball
faster than any woman on earth. So good luck, quadruplets! Oh! It literally went past all of them. I’m sorry! - It's ok.
- You killed us. I'm gonna send this to
Yetunde Price Resource Center, so really
excited about it. And what I'm really excited about is that
we have Steph Curry and Neymar later in this video. But right now we have a 1V1 with
a different basketball all-star… And for our next 1V1,
we have Giannis, the Greek Freak! A nine time All-Star,
two-time MVP, and NBA champion. Versus Tristan,
your typical basketball player. Let's get it baby. First one of you to make a layup, free
throw, three pointer, and half court shot wins this $100,000. I’m about to win all this money. Let's see if an average guy can beat
an NBA champion. 3, 2, 1… Go! Let's see who wins. - Wait, he made it.
- It's a race. Pass me the rock. Hey help him out,
Nolan! Let's get it. Tristan's already halfway to 100K. Gotta hit your free throw,
Giannis. I'm ready. Oh, Giannis missed!
He missed! Oh, he hit the three! He’s going to
half court! Come on. Giannis! Giannis!
What is happening? No way.
If he makes it— Tristan only needs a half court
to win it all. - Giannis, it’s just a free throw.
- I'm ready. That's it! Alright, Giannis made
his free throw. He's an NBA champion. He's clutch.
He's gonna come back. Go for it! That happened so fast! This is crazy. Let’s go! I'm so salty right now. You said you’re,
he’s salty— - Man, I'm so salty right now.
- Look at his face. He’s so mad! Come on, man This guy came to Milwaukee and
left with 100,000 in this pocket. Wow. - You good?
- I'm good. Don't drown in
the money. Well since the Greek Freak
couldn’t beat an Average Joe, let's see if another
basketball legend can. For our next 1V1, we have
the greatest shooter on the planet: Steph Curry! Leading the NBA with
the most three pointers of all time, no human in history has shot a basketball
better than Steph Curry. Which is why he is going to be
going up against the number one shooter in
this high school. You ready to have some fun? - Yeah!
- Alright! The game is simple. We're gonna give Steph Curry 30 seconds
to make as many threes as he can. Demarrion will then have 60 seconds
to try to beat his score. If he does,
we will give him $100,000. If he loses, we'll give it to
whatever charity Steph Curry wants us to. Who do you like more,
Steph Curry or LeBron James? - LeBron.
- So he's a 'Bron guy? Oh my gosh. You shouldn’t piss him off
before you go against him. I like it. Alright. Head on over
to the corner. Let's see why he's the greatest
three point shooter to ever live. 3, 2, 1… Go! Oh my gosh.
Oh, he's just not missing. Oh, he missed! Alright, he missed one. 20 seconds left. Half the time has now gone by. Ok, only eight so far. He's onto rack three.
There's only 10 seconds left. Oh, he missed! 3, 2, 1… Time’s up,
time’s up! 14 shots in 30 seconds. Come on! Come on! Let's see if Demarrion
can beat that. And obviously, since he's just
a high schooler, he'll have twice as much time
as Steph Curry. I really wanna
see him do this. Will Demarrion, in front of
his whole high school, win this life-changing $100,000? Let's find out. Let’s go! 3, 2, 1… Go! 100 grand on the line. It's alright.
Don't give up yet. Remember, you still have
double the time. Alright,
he made one. 100 bands, man.
Lock in! Alright, he's starting
to ease into it. Yes! He still has half a minute left. Alright, Demarrion, you're still in this
and you have 20 seconds left. Hey, who's gonna win? Steph Curry! Alright, he’s gotta hit
all these. Come on. 3, 2, 1… Last shot! Come on! And that's Demarrion 9.
Steph Curry 14. That was an honor, man.
How'd that feel? All right. - Is, like, your heart going crazy?
- Yeah. Steph, what charity do you want us
to donate this $100,000 to? The Eat.Learn.Play. Foundation, so it's gonna go to a great,
great, great, great cause. Let's go film with one of the most elite
racecar drivers on Earth. For our next 1V1, we have two-time
Formula champion Dan Ticktum. ""Dan Ticktum!"" And he's gonna be racing Ronnie. And obviously Ronnie
is not an FE driver, so he has to do three laps
before Dan does four. If you win, I will give you $100,000. And if you win, I'll donate $100,000 to
whatever charity you want. My charity. It's coming to me, baby.
It's coming to me. How much money have
you lost in our videos? 750K. We about to make it 850K? Well, we'll see.
I hope so. Redemption! These two will be strapped into
two of the fastest-accelerating single-seater cars on the planet. Out of the billions of cars on Earth,
nothing launches faster than these. And we're just giving it to
my friend to drive. I'm not listening. Anything that’s gonna
make me scared. I'm just driving. No joke, while doing a test lap
for this video, I slammed into the wall at
multiple Gs of force, so I don't blame him. Pray for me, mama. $100,000 on the line! - Dan, are you ready?
- Yeah. Ronnie, are you ready? Let's do it, bro. 3, 2, 1… Go! Oh, Ronnie actually
got a faster start. Now Ronnie’s
getting destroyed. He’s obliterating him! Yo! This is crazy. Dan is already significantly
ahead of Ronnie. - Here they come.
- There it is! Oh, he's going so fast. Dan is smoking him! While Ronnie's playing it safe,
Dan's literally going 200 miles an hour. Even with the handicap,
Dan might blow him out. These things are fast, man. Dan's coming around the turn,
we're about to see him on the stretch. Alright, there he is. And Dan's done with lap one. Oh my gosh. That sounds like a fighter jet. So that was Dan. And Ronnie…
Ronnie is very far behind. Where’s Ronnie?
I'm coming, I'm coming. Ronnie's finally completed his first lap. There he is! You’re doing good! He's not doing good. Faster! What is he doing? Bro, that's the straightaway. - Ronnie.
- I hear you, Jimmy. What’s up, bro? Ronnie, you're getting destroyed. Oh, that was a bad turn. How fast are you guys going? 112… That's already Dan’s second lap,
and Ronnie's just finished his first. Speed it up! I'm pushing the throttle
all the way down, baby. He’s about to lap you, Ronnie. C'mon baby,
we can do this! Go faster! I’m coming, baby. Ronnie, don’t make this so easy! I’m running like Forrest, Jimmy. I’m running like Forrest. I’m coming. Oh no! - See ya!
- Oh no, oh no! Dan's already completed
his third lap. This is not even close. Alright, I feel good.
This last lap's gonna be my best one. When Dan passes this finish line, he wins.
They're both on their final lap. Let's go! He’s already finished? What? Dan! You won! Let's go! Let's go! 100K! He's jumping in it! In front of Ronnie!
In front of you! What charity do you want to
donate this money to? Help for Heroes.
This is a UK veteran charity. Does that make you feel better, Ronnie? Yeah, I guess so, man. He’s like,
“My bank account’s a better cause.” If you thought hat was epic, just wait for
the moment later in this video when Neymar 1V1s a random guy. But for our next 1V1, I got a stadium filled with
almost 20,000 people and the greatest NBA players of all time to watch this random guy go head-to-head
with Damian Lillard, one of only three players ever to score
70+ points in a game. We're gonna see if he can make 1 shot
before Damian makes 3. If he does,
we're gonna give him $100,000. He nervous. Alright, Damian you're up first. One of the best
shooters of all time. He actually missed. Anything you want to say to everyone? First try, come on. First try, you can win
$100,000 right here. - I go whenever?
- Yeah! Go for it. That's 1 of 3. You gotta make 1 before
he makes 2 more. 100 grand! Is it game time? Alright, he's going easy on you, clearly. You hear how loud they’re getting.
They're getting hyped. Alright surely he’s gonna hit this one.
That’ll be 2 out of 3. - Just shoot as high as you can
- Yeah. Oh, ok. That's 2 out of 3. He only has to make 1 more. He did it! He did it! How's it feel to win $100,000 in
front of everyone? This is surreal.
I can't thank anybody but my dad. Thank you for the opportunity. Alright, let’s head to the next bit.
That was awesome. Up next, we have two-time MVP,
six-time All-Star, Aaron Judge. - How's it going, man?
- I'm great. And he's gonna be going head to head in
a home run derby versus… One of the greatest baseball players
the world has ever seen. He is a pitcher's worst nightmare. A Division 2 juggernaut. Aaron Judge's toughest challenge yet
will be against... Yeah! Woo!
Let's go! Chandler. - How many career home runs do you have?
- One. How many do you have? More than one. Well, 300 is a lot more
than just one. In fact, no one in
all of baseball has hit more home runs in the past 5 years
than this guy. Which is why,
to make things even, he's gonna get 10 swings and
Chandler's gonna get 20. Might need more than that. You’re supposed to be confident. I'm getting that 100 grand. - Yeah, there we go.
- I like it. This is literally the greatest hitter
in baseball right now. Chandler doesn't have a chance. Hits 1 of 10 for Aaron Judge.
100 grand on the line. Alright. Ooh, not a home run. He's oh for one. - That's money in my pocket.
- Take your time, man. No rush. Oh my God. Oh, there it goes. Oh, that is gone! - Home run, baby.
- Oh my God. 1 for 2. He won't do that again,
he won’t. Hop them up. He was aiming for
the moon with that one. Hey, throw a curve ball. Wait, I think that's warning track. That's not a home run. Where’s the wind at? He's 1 for 4. I might be able to hit one. - That might hit across.
- I think we pissed him off. Home run! Here we go. Alright, we're halfway
through, 2 for 5. You got him in the pocket. He's on fire. Hey wait a second. Ok. Thank you. I'm trying to throw him off,
you know? Pop fly. It worked. It did. Aaron, I heard you're on
T-Mobile, right? Yep. By joining T-Mobile, you instantly get
Magenta Status like me and Judge, which comes with tons of premium perks
like free in-flight WiFi, hotel discounts, and even a free subscription to MLB.TV so
you can watch more stuff like that. That's you! That counts.
That's gotta count, right? Yeah. No, of course.
Bro, he dinged the top of the fence. 4 for 8. Chandler’s counting,
so don't worry. Stop it. T-Mobile Magenta Status will also
give you the opportunity to win tickets to the World Series and discounts to
thousands of other live events. Just for being a T-Mobile member. Why were you out here? T-Mobile is so much more
than your phone carrier. If you wanna sign up, just scan
the QR code on Chandler's face. Get it. Alright, let's see
this final swing. Yes. 5 for 10. You hit 6 home runs,
I wire you $100,000. - And you get to say you beat Aaron Judge!
- Let's go! So you’re signing me to
the Yankees after. Where's my bat? Alright, swing 1 of 20. Oh my God. Wait, where did that
come from? That's you, Karl.
That’s you. I don't have
my glasses on. And he's almost
out of there. Now do that, just hit it
40 feet further. What are you doing
swinging at that? That hit off the telephone pole. Is my swing ok?
Any tips? - Oh no, no, no, no.
- What? Oh, he instantly said, ""Nah."" Dude, I'm not 6'8"".
What do you want me to do? I like my chances. Hey, you got it.
Lock in! Heads up. He's going more sideways than
over the home run fence. He's only hit 1 of the first
3 swings fair. First baseman
catches that one. Hey… That's a double in the gap. It's not what we're looking for, though. Yeah, you gotta pull it. - Hey!
- That-a-boy! That's not a home run. Oh for 6. Lots of ball game left! I'm trying to swing
out of my shoes. You're working the whole field,
which I like. Nolan, that’s you. Where is it? This is why we gave him
so many swings. That doesn't count. Alright. This is not going well.
He's oh for 11. Chandler, you gotta
start hitting 'em. No… Chandler, I'm begging you. Chandler, come on.
I gave you double the tries. By this point,
it was pretty clear that the chances of Chandler catching up
were pretty slim. Time out. I'm just a hitting machine.
Like, maybe I should just get stronger? I don’t know what do. There's 100 G's on the line.
You're oh for 13. So to make this even
somewhat of a challenge, if you hit just one home run,
I'll give each of you $100,000. I gotta step up right now. Aaron, you have any
advice for him? You thought your moment was
gonna be against me. Yeah. - Oh, that’s—
- I mean, what other chance do I have? Don’t let him do this to you! Alright, come on. We're all rooting for you. Thanks. I knew that if Big Justice could hit
5 home runs, then Chandler, the King of Clutch,
could hit just 1. Alright, pitch 14. Wait, is that it? - Hit up! Go up!
- He held it. Wait! No way. Ah, that was the
warning track. You're close. That might be it. Wait. He was so close. Next one, it’s you! - Nah, don't be swinging that high.
- It's a great swing. I appreciate it. A second earlier. No! Bad swing. Karl, that's you.
Catch it! Chandler, we just need
1 home run. That might be it. Off the wall. Alright, you have
2 swings left. Come on. Just one. I'm getting lazy.
I'm tired. Well, you're gonna have to put everything
you've got left into this last swing. You got this. Think of your family,
think of everybody. You got this, Chandler! Chandler, you gotta get one, bro. Last swing. Wait! It's so close! It was, like, two feet! That's what you get
paid to do, right? I get paid to be funny,
you get paid to hit home runs. Judge, what charity would you like us
to donate this money to? Oh, this will go to
the All Rise Foundation. Chandler, don't look at this. Yeah, honestly you should just
look away. I mean, I'm glad it's going
to the kids, man. That's why I didn't
hit any of ‘em. You’re a good guy. Alright. On to the next 1V1. But for this 1V1, we're gonna do something
a little bit different. We're gonna see if
these 5 contestants can hold their breath
longer collectively… than this gentleman. That's it? The World Record Breath-Holder. Are you scared at all
of the 5 of them? No, I'm not. Those guys, with all due respect,
they uh… I'm cannonballing, first time. I'm gonna try to get as
much water out as possible. I could try to drink it. Yeah. And you still hold
the world record? Yes. I started when I was 48. How old are you now? - 60.
- Dang! Don't lungs, like,
degrade with age? It's like 5 minutes. - Like, you guys got it.
- Easily. And if somehow you guys
do manage to beat him, I will give you… No! Bring it on in! A brand new Lamborghini. We gotta win this! In the next 20 minutes,
this could be your guys's Lamborghini. Wait, 20 minutes? No, you said 5 minutes was
his best time. It's like five minutes.
You guys got it. This could be your Lamborghini
very soon. We will die for
this Lamborghini. Contestants! Will both of you
get inside the tank? I don't know how to swim, though. Oh, if you don’t know
how to swim, you won. Yo, look at him.
Look what he's doing. Do that. He's doing breathing techniques. Are you ready? - Yes.
- Let’s run it. 3, 2, 1… Go! Let’s go! They are both under the water. Five average dudes versus
the greatest breath-holder on the planet. Hey! What? - Five what?
- We’re not average! Five slightly-above-average dudes. You guys might
win this Lambo. Oh, he's already panicking. What did I say?
Stay down there, bro! Dude, that was only 23 seconds! Ed, we're all dying for this. Wait, no. He came up!
Get out! Get in there! Wait, I gotta— Get in there! They are freaking out over there. Meanwhile, he’s just zen-ing out. What? Push him down! No way! It’s only been 45 seconds. Push him down! These guys quickly realized just how
difficult this challenge actually was. They’re already on the third person and
it’s only been a minute. That's it? Alright, 2 left over here. Before they knew it, they had put all the
pressure on their one remaining player. - What is this?
- That’s a Lamborghini. No, this is your Lamborghini. It's my Lamborghini. Now, get in there! You got this!
You got this! C’mon! C’mon, Raech. C’mon, Raech. Hey, calm down! Wait! Wait!
He’s panicking! Wait, is he gonna give up? Oh, no no no no no! Don't let him come up! Time’s up!
You guys lost! Don, you're good! You guys only lasted
3 minutes and 13 seconds. Can we make sure
he's alive? Don't worry.
He was still very much alive. And went on to hold his breath for
11 minutes and 45 seconds. I'm ok! Now that I know this guy is
somehow still breathing, I say we go to our final competition
before we finish with Neymar. To my right is Joey Chestnut. You'll know him as the winner of literally
every hot dog eating contest ever in history. And to my left
are 4 Sumo wrestlers. Combined, these behemoths
weigh over 1,500 pounds. Whichever side eats the most hot dogs in
10 minutes wins this $100,000. 3, 2, 1… Go. The glizzy contest has now begun. They've each ate half of 1,
which means they've technically ate 2. And Joey is already on his fourth. He's already eating at
twice the speed, gentlemen. He's going so fast I cannot
look away on this one. I don't know how he's doing that. These are all gonna go
in his stomach. It's been a minute,
and Joey’s already ate 10 hot dogs. And they're on 4, which means individually, they're eating
one tenth of the speed of Joey Chestnut. But the Sumo wrestlers
aren't giving up yet. This is his twentieth hot dog. He's on number 20.
And it's only been 2.5 minutes. Eleven over here by the
4 Sumo wrestlers. Guys, you're very, very close.
Just keep eating. You're beating them so badly. Do you wanna tell me what you think of
this Feastables chocolate bar? The greatest chocolate on the planet? Here you go. You can chew.
Oh! Ok! That’s good! Would you say it’s the world's
best chocolate? Oh, yeah!
Best in the world. Feastables is available
wherever you get your chocolate. For God's sake,
go try some! Anyways, forget about the chocolate!
Keep eating! I think I'm full at this point. You're full?
Is that what you said? Forty seconds remain!
It's a close race. Everyone, just shove
glizzies in your mouth! Put the glizzies in your mouth! Yes! Hurry! C’mon! Do you want it? Take the wieners out of your mouths.
The time is up. This harder more than Sumo! Chandler, how many glizzies
did Joey Chestnut eat? 46. If we go over here to
the 4 sumo wrestlers, how many did they eat? Thirty three hot dogs. Joey, You won! Yes! Can anyone beat this man? What charity do you want me to donate this
$100,000 to? Gleaners Food Bank in Indiana.
They make sure kids don't go hungry. Are you gonna eat
all the food? Nah, I'm gonna make sure the kids
are eating plenty of food. You're gonna make sure
the kids get the food. - Yeah.
- Ok. Now that I’ve given away almost
a million dollars, it's time to give away even more in
our epic grand finale with Neymar! And now, the moment you've
all been waiting for. One of the greatest football players
on the planet: Neymar! An international football superstar with
28 championship wins, one Olympic gold medal,
and above all, the crown as Brazil's all-time
leading goal scorer. He’s gonna be going up against our boy
Higor over here. And they're going to be competing for
half a million dollars. If you win, this money goes
straight into your bank account. But if Neymar wins, I will donate it to
whatever charity he chooses. - Makes sense?
- Yes, sir. Sorry, you lose! Oh, he just said,
""You lose!"" You're gonna take that? No, definitely not! Ok. Neymar,
does that scare you? Ok! As always, the rules of
this game are simple. We're gonna start things off with
a penalty shootout. If they both score,
we're gonna go 15 feet back. And we’re gonna keep going
15 feet back until one of them scores and
one of them misses. Who’s shooting first? - Alright. 1, 2…
- Rock, paper, scissors, shoot! - I won.
- Me first. Yeah, Neymar's first? Put the pressure on me.
That’s what you want, right? Easy. Easy! Ok. We all knew they were both gonna score,
but now let's head 15 feet back. Oh, he's getting serious. He's deemed you're a worthy opponent.
He tied his shoe. It doesn't take a football player as
coveted as Neymar to nail the first 4 stations of shots. So far, they're both
making it look easy. But the fifth station and beyond
separates the average from the elite. Eventually this is gonna become
hard for them. We will keep going the whole distance on
the pitch if we have to. - Now you go first.
- Me first? The GOAT said he wanted
you to go first. I will go first then. Ok! That was your
worst shot so far! Alright, Neymar's up! Oh my gosh! Well that literally curved
out of the goal and in! I love pressure! How does this compare to
playing in the World Cup? Nah! World Cup more pressure. Hey, wait, wait! Before you go,
you wanna hold the half a million? Sure thing. You can score this, he misses,
and then this is yours. You can beat Neymar, ok?
Believe in yourself. Alright. No! Neymar has to score.
If he misses, it's a reshoot. Miss it. Alright, let's give him
a little space. The goal only counts if
it hits the crossbar and goes in. Otherwise, it doesn’t count. Neymar is so good that he doesn't want me
to count the goal unless it touches the crossbar and
then goes in. Bro, don't miss. C’mon. Don’t miss!
C’mon, man! Ok! He is lucky Neymar
is a forgiving man. Neymar didn't even wait. That was the most nonchalant thing
I've ever seen in my life. Alright, for this one
I say Neymar goes first. Normally in Neymar shoes, there's a
giant world class goalie in goal. Now it's empty. Oh my gosh! There you are. I'm worried for you, buddy.
This could be it. Just aim at that camera over there
and then— Neymar is literally coaching him. See! That's it! Easy! See! He did it! Let's go! We are officially at midfield. We'll keep going as
long as this takes. Whenever you're ready. Oh my gosh! Oh, that’s not a goal! Is it? Wait, let's go look.
Come on! Wait, wait, wait.
Get a shot of that. Yeah, it's on the line. The majority of the ball's over the line.
How does that work? No, it has to be full! Oh, really? Neymar! Come check this out! Nah, no goal, no goal. Yeah, it's on the line! No goal. On the line! If the ball is still touching the line,
it is technically not a goal. And as you can see,
it's on the line. That means, if you score,
you win. If you score,
you won, bro! From midfield, you now have a
half a million dollar shot. Yes, sir. Ok! Higor, it's on you. Half a million dollars on the line. The biggest shot
of his life. The GOAT Neymar watching.
Is Igor clutch? He did it! Let's go! Wait, where did those whales come from?
I'm confused. Let’s go! Aw, that's so sweet! Here’s your half a million dollars! - Yes! Let's go! C'mon!
- Let's go! Alright! Let's go whale! Ok. Oh, he’s eating him! I don't know what's going on.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4GmbBoYQjE,I Survived 100 Hours In An Ancient Temple,946,20250510,en,"We just got dropped off on
this 2,000-year-old ancient temple! - Bro, we're so high up!
- And we're surrounded by jungle. See ya later! Let's go see what we can find! In this video, we're gonna be exploring
dozens of ancient temples, all of which hide ancient Mayan secrets
from the world, deep underground. Everything you guys are seeing now
the Mayans didn't want us to see. Nobody gets to go where we're going. Including exploring one of the
seven wonders of the world. But we only had 100 hours
to make discoveries. Dude, I'm discovering
these stairs are huge. Yeah. I wanna find an escalator. Let's go discover
the secrets of the Mayans. This is the door to the inside of
this massive Mayan temple. Oh, that's a deep tunnel. Dibs on going first! That's fine with me.
There’s booby traps. - This temple is over 2,000 years old.
- Woah. This is insane! We're inside an ancient temple right now. Where are we going?
Oh, my gosh! Oh, wow. The first thing you see in this temple
is this giant statue, which is supposedly the corn god
inside of a jaguar’s mouth. This is so beautiful! My gosh! I'm gonna tell you what I think this means
then you tell me what it means, okay? This is a hand. This is a parade.
That's a toilet. - Errr! Wrong!
- Okay. No, that is not his toilet.
That is his earring. - Yeah, Jimmy.
- Oh. So here's the thing,
this place is actually a pyramid built on top of a pyramid. So, the deeper we go in,
the older things get. - Be careful, boys.
- This is so sketchy, Jimmy. Can't believe the government's
letting us do this! It really is crazy. Not even archaeologists
are allowed to go back here. How deep underground are we? And after hours of navigating
this ancient temple, we finally made it to the end. Now that we're at the end,
you said you had a surprise. Yes! This has been found in
the last two decades. Whoa! What?! It is a funerary mask. This is the face of one of
the kings of the Snake Kingdom. The Mayans used masks like this one
to shield those that had passed away from dangers on
their journey to the underworld. - Can I hold it?
- Yes. - This was made over 1,000 years ago.
- Yes. Which means my great-great-great-great-
great grandparents weren't even alive. Why is this not in a museum?
Why's a YouTuber holding this? Get this away from me!
Take it. Take it. Don't tell anybody. Okay. I totally won't show
200,000,000 people. That's it for this temple,
but we are in the middle of a giant city with multiple other ancient temples! And later in this video, even visiting
the seventh wonder of the world! Let’s find some treasure! This jungle’s full of monkeys, snakes,
and people have even died to jaguars here. Well, we survived Snake Island. Wait… Is that a monkey? Sir! Sir! Sir! Well, guys, this is where
we’re gonna be camping tonight. Look at these hammocks! We still have over
a dozen temples to explore. I need you guys to get some good sleep,
because this video's just getting started. Good morning, boys! Good morning! First things first, we need to explore
the rest of this massive abandoned city. And looking at it now, it's hard to
imagine what it might've looked like. And, so, I'll just show you. Over 100,000 people
used to live in this city. That's what that used to look like. This is what they think these roads
looked like. There were temples everywhere.
It was flourishing. But on the inside, you’d witness
magnificent artwork like this. - Whoa!
- Oh, this is incredible. One of my favorite part of these videos
is when we take old paintings and bring 'em to life. So this is our best estimation of
what they represent. Bro this is so cool! It’s a rare glimpse into what the life of
a Mayan looked like 2,500 years ago. This is amazing! Nolan really thought that was a llama. - Can we talk about this for a second?
- Nolan, you thought that was a llama? Cuz, look, if— I thought that was the eye,
that was the mouth, and I thought that was the leg. Yeah, I thought you… were smart. And after I picked on Nolan, Nolan returned the favor to
Tareq with a spider. - Tareq, only—
- Stop.  Tareq's gonna quit. My friends have a strange way of
having fun, but the Mayan way was arguably stranger. We're standing where a ball court used
to exist over 2,000 years ago. This was the first ever team sport
to use a ball. As far as we know… Also the captain of the losing team's
head got cut off. Yes. No, but the Mayans are crazy, man. - Whoa!
- This is huge. Yeah. So beautiful. Why don't we build temples
like this today? Around 2,000 years ago, this is where
the king and his queen lived. But 2,500 years ago,
this is what it looked like. Massive crowds of people would gather here and even wait for hours just for
a chance to see the king. And here it is today. - Let's go check it out.
- Okay. 2,000 years ago,
the king would probably stand here and watch sports from his palace. Kinda cool. Oh, my gosh.
It's kinda like a labyrinth. Yes, because if you want to
protect your king… - You make it confusing.
- …you make it confusing Ernesto, be honest with me. Has anyone ever pressed this block in to
see if it reveals hidden treasure? I would not do it… How about this one? How about this one? You’re telling me the king didn't build
a hidden treasure room 2,600 years ago? Maybe yes, but it's hidden. With the hopes of finding
the king's treasure, we ventured to a cave deep in the jungle, where the treasure may lie. Hey, Jimmy did not say anything
about bats, bro. Oh my…
Yo, there's so many bats. They just flew right behind our heads. The Mayans, they used to think that this
is the mouth of the monster of the Earth. Look above us right now. We're surrounded by bats. Thousands of bats swarming us. Dude, it’s a bat tornado. If there is a Mayan treasure there,
it's under tons of… - Bat poop.
- …bat poop. I feel like I've already
found my treasure. This is beautiful.
We're gonna leave. There's a lot of bats.
I would prefer if you go fast. Oh, I got poo’d on! For me, this is the real treasure. - Oh, it hit my hand!
- Nolan, let's get you out of here. We’ve gotta get out of here.
There's absolutely no treasure here. But there's still one more temple
that might have treasure. And because it's already dark out— Boys, light your torches,
and let's go on an adventure. If our torches go out before we get to
an ancient temple, I'm gonna be very sad. Temple! Temple!
Temple! This is so much cooler with just torches.
Let's see what this bad boy looks like. Feel like an ancient adventurer. - But as it turns out…
- All right, it's a dead end. …this didn't go well either. Everything's a dead end. - Oh, my God!
- What was that? There's, like, a monkey up there. Wait, is that a monkey or a jaguar?! Why is this video becoming
scary all of a sudden? Make sure you sleep well tonight, because I have a big surprise
for you in the morning. Let me guess, you guys thought
the dozens of ancient temples in this city was the entire video? - Yeah.
- Yeah, I think so. Send the helicopter back. Because to explore even further,
we were gonna need a lift. I'm climbing these stairs like a dog… We're almost there. There's our ride! All right, we’ve gotta go. Let's go explore some more temples! And where we're going has some of
the craziest ancient remains ever built by mankind. And to kick off this location,
we're gonna visit this bad boy, which the Mayans used to call
the gateway to the underworld. Back in the day,
there used to be giant fangs here. What happened to them? They fell off. That seems logical.
Let's go explore! Whoa… this is awesome. There's some very special features that
I love, like that structure in the middle. Wow. I'm gonna guess this
building was a temple. Was it for sacrifices? - Yes. You got it.
- Yes! I had something right! - What a nerd.
- Bro lost his hat. But what our guide
really wanted to show us was a cave which Mayans believed
humans emerged from. The Maya believe that humanity
came from a cave. Deep inside of there is what they called
the Tree of Life, and they believed that all of us spawned
from this very majestic, beautiful tree deep in this cave. This is so sacred that we're gonna
do a ceremony to ask for permission to
the spirits of the cave. If I was a betting man, I'd say
the spirits are gonna reject Nolan. And as we entered the cave… Whoa. Okay. This definitely looks sacred. …we were met with the ritual
our guide spoke of. What is he doing now? He's purifying the entrance of the cave. And it's here where we would seek
the approval of the gods. Naturally, I wasn't worried at all. But were the gods really about to let
Nolan enter this sacred place? I hope they accept me. I think it's good. What's he doing? All right, is he good? - Come on. The spirits didn't reject him.
- Thank goodness. So with the gods
officially on our side, we started our journey for
the Tree of Life. But the deeper into the cave we went,
the hotter it got. Is it just me, or is it only getting
hotter in this cave? It’s getting hotter, and the air's
gonna be more difficult to breathe. More difficult to breathe, yeah. I’m so hot right now. The deeper you go in the cave,
the thinner the air gets. I don't know if you can see the sweat.
It is really hot in here. This cave just keeps on going,
but at least there’s no bats. Everything you guys are seeing now,
the Mayans didn't want us to see. They literally tried sealing this off. Imagine being a Maya 2,000 years ago,
see this beautiful cave, and all of a sudden see
this beautiful room… Whoa. …and the amazing tree. Oh… Am I the only one that thought
the Tree of Life was an actual tree? Yes, this is it. This is the sacred Ceiba
that holds the sky. Are these pots around it the same pots
the Mayans created? Yes, sir. So the tall ones,
they put incense, and they burn it to
get the attention of the gods. This is very cool. If you were a Mayan
thousands of years ago, and actually believed that
this is where humans came from, I understand why they thought
this was so sacred. Of course, of course. But this cave is about to
get really dangerous, because where we're going next, we will
literally need an oxygen tank to breathe. Why do I keep doing things in videos
that could kill me? Worst idea ever! So after a few deep breaths
to top off on oxygen… - How deep are we going?
- About two football fields. Yo, I'm gonna stay up here. - You're always backing out on it.
- He said there's no oxygen. I don't wanna hear it. And Nolan may have
been on to something, because at the literal first thing
our guide wanted to show us… I'm dizzy, and, uh… - Are you good? Hey, take—
- No, I'm good, I'm good. Whether you like it or not,
you're gonna get some oxygen. Breathe. Anyways, what were you saying? Well, there's some, uh,
ceramic pot shards. Whoa… This is so cool. Can I take one home? Well, you would go to jail. - I would go to jail?
- Yeah, sure. All right.
I won't take one home. I can't believe they actually
believe me. They're so gull—
they're so gullible. Time to blend in
and scare 'em. Look at all the bats in this tunnel. Let's continue! Wait, I actually— Unironically, I don't know.
Do bats bite humans? I found a hiding spot. Oh, there's a bat. Jimmy, get you a hit of this oxygen. So we're only getting deeper. Here, get you some. The air’s getting thicker. But as we got close to the end, we were confronted by
the final boss of this secret tunnel. - See those, uh…
- Okay. …the stalactites? Wait! Jimmy, behind you is
the biggest spider in the world. Oh, my gosh! What did the Mayans give
the insects down here? Why do you think
the world's largest spider is at the end of a secret tunnel
in the most sacred place of the Mayans? - It's protecting something.
- What do you think? I think so. So instead of fighting the final boss… …we let the secret tunnel
keep its secrets. Oh, my gosh. That was terrifying. I almost threw the oxygen tank
right at your face. And after escaping with our lives,
we were exhausted. So we headed to our new camp to turn in. Because not only were we gonna
need our energy for the seventh wonder of the world. For day four, I wanted to know what
the Mayans did for fun. Starting with… The first ever team-based game to
use a ball. Over 3,000 years ago,
the Mayans invented the game of pitz, where you score by shooting a ball
through a small hoop, like in basketball. Only, you can't use your hands
just like in soccer. But remember what we said
all the way back in day two… The losing captain’s head
would get cut off. The head? - This is hard.
- I say we're gonna get the hang of it. And although we started to
get a handle on the ball, it's safe to say
we were still far from scoring… So I even brought in
our camera guys to help out. But even then, failure after failure
only brought us countless more failures. Wait, wait. We might not ever score. But in ancient times, giving up meant
literally losing your head. Nolan?
You better stand up, bro. And so failure after failure
continued until… After a long day of this brutal sport,
the surviving players might've celebrated by heading down a sinkhole for
a relaxing dip in the natural pools. And while I'm not cutting any heads off,
Nolan did lose at pitz. - Is the water cold?
- You know, it’s kinda refreshing! - Oh, is it?
- Yeah. Go for it! Oh, this water feels amazing. It doesn't look like
you think it feels amazing. Oh, it's so cold! And although a swim in
the Cenote is refreshing, the craziest Mayan temple —
a literal seventh wonder of the world — is still to come. But first… A classic Mayan dinner! So everything you're seeing here is what the Mayans used to eat
over 1,000 years ago. As you've heard throughout this video,
they worshiped the corn god. And if you don't know,
corn is a main ingredient in tortillas. Whoever's editing this, did the Mayans
invent tacos? Yes or no? To our final night, cheers. Enjoy the Mayan tacos. And to wrap up the night,
we have a special Mayan dessert. The brand new
Feastables Peanut Butter Cups! Wait— brand new
but it's a Mayan dessert? Don't ask questions.
It's dessert. Here you go. The king of marketing over here. Bro, look at how much
peanut butter is in there. Isn't it sad that there are
humans on this Earth whose taste buds
have not been blessed with the brand new
Feastables Peanut Butter Cups? So if you want an ethically-sourced,
amazing-tasting snack… - …make sure you reach for Feastables.
- It's good. The only Mayan-approved snack
on the planet. Before I go to sleep, I wanna let you guys
know that I'm giving away $500,000 to ten random people
that subscribe to the channel. No joke. My birthday is coming up. And to celebrate, ten random people
that subscribe to the channel will win $50,000 each. Thanks to Jack Link's,
the best beef jerky, for providing me
this awesome birthday present. And I'll see you guys at
the seventh wonder of the world. And with the last remaining hours of
our trip here, it's the moment you've
all been waiting for: the seventh wonder of the world, the temple of K’uk’ulkan. Bro, this is so cool. I can't believe we're actually here. K’uk’ulkan is the seventh wonder of
the world, partially for its grand size, but weirdly enough,
also for the way it sounds. The Mayans somehow constructed this in a
way where if you clap in front of it… …you hear what sounds like a laser
coming back at you. All right, anyways!
What we actually came here for… At the top of this pyramid is a temple
so sacred to the locals that no one is allowed up there. Which begs the question: What Mayan
secrets lay in that ancient room? Out of respect for the culture and all the
people who hold this very sacred, we are not gonna touch the temple. Instead, we're gonna fly this drone up to
see what's in that secret room. - You cool with this?
- Yeah, that's cool. Godspeed. Oh, my gosh, this looks so majestic.
I'm dying to know. All right, let's see what's in this room. Wait… Arthur, the room's empty. Well… 500 years ago,
the Spanish came here, and they take a lot of stuffs inside. But before everything was stolen, this is what historians think the seventh
wonder of the world looked like. Man, not gonna lie,
it's actually very beautiful. And while we didn't find any gold, I'm grateful that I can even visit
these ancient monuments and share it with you. Guys, I love you.  Mexico, it's been great.
See you later."

to pull him to the bottom of the ocean. And this is only the first
of 7 death traps we have planned for him. Like balancing

you can get to the exit moves on with you to the next trap. The challenge begins now. Good luck. All right, I'm just gonna get froggy. Oh, he's getting so close to the bear. You went for that one of all of ‘em? How are you staying so calm? I'm not. I look this way,
but the reality is, I'm not calm. The bear just looked at you walk by. Uh, be careful, bro… Even though Byron was absolutely terrified - of getting torn to shreds by this bear…
- Brother? The bear is literally standing
on one of the bags. He's gonna rip that open. The bear was fixated on one bag of money. He's preoccupied. Byron snuck around the room,
easily collecting the rest, until the bag the bear was eating
was the last one. The last fifty grand
is currently being eaten by the bear. Byron, you don't have to do this.
You can stop. Byron, if you're too afraid
to steal that last bag from the bear… you can quit now
and just move on to the next trap with the money you did get. No. I'm not quitting. Well, be careful.
Don't grab it yet. Just maybe wait
till he gets bored of it. He's trying to distract the bear
away from his money. Oh, it might— It's kinda working. He's trying to get a killing machine
to go over to him. He might be the first human ever to want
a thousand-pound bear to come towards him. Oh my God,
he's going for the last bag! - Oh! He did it!
- He got it! Oh my God! Oh my God! Congrats! And for our third of seven death traps,
you might recognize the challenge, but we put a new spin on it
just for Byron. Take off your blindfold!
Welcome to the next death trap. Oh, no, Jimmy… We're not even 100 feet in the air yet. Oh my God! Raise us up! Welcome to the Balance Beam of Death! God, c’mon… Actually, we'll call it
the $500,000 Balance Beam. Your 500 grand is dangling
100 feet in the air. You must balance on this narrow beam, unlock each bag of 50 grand,
and throw them on the target below. Any money that lands on the target,
you move on with, and any money that ends up in the water
is lost forever. Oh my God. You chicken now?
You gonna walk across? The only thing on this platform that's
chicken are your legs. This is for you, kids. Oh, he's off! The first step. My God, he's doing it.
He's actually doing it. Oh my gosh, look at his feet.
This is insane! Now he's gotta reach for the money. Oh, he got the money. This is scary 'cause, look,
he's actually leaning back. Bro, what's going through your mind?
You're like a scarecrow. - Jimmy you're talking too much right now.
- You're not talking enough! Oh, God. All right.
Are you gonna throw 'em from here? He landed one! Don’t celebrate too early, Byron.
You still have 9 bags to go. He's lining his shot up! Speaking of legs,
my leg is cramping right now. Come massage it right now for me! Oh, he threw it! He’s two for two. All right, can he keep his streak alive? Third bag is off. Bullseye! He has $200,000 on his target,
and Byron isn't even halfway across yet. You feel that wind, Byron? Oh, yeah. The wind
is really picking up. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
It's very unstable. It's actually shaking like crazy! Oh, he almost fell! God! Shoot! Don't pass out on me! Oh, he's just dropping ‘em.
He's just dropping ’em! Oh, no. It bounced off. He lost 50K. C’mon, baby! And if you're wondering who
this maniac is, his name is Byron, a battle-hardened Army Ranger who's fought
in the world's most dangerous war zones, and above all else, he wants
to bring this money home to his kids. Let's go! C’mon, baby. That's it,
that's it. That's already $100,000 in the water. And if he falls now,
he's losing another $100,000. You gotta land these next two! - Right on the money!
- Yeah. All right. The last bag! I'm in my head right now. Byron, do it for your kids! Byron, you lost a lot of money
on this round. You've already lost 150 grand,
and you're only on the third trap. - Jimmy!
- Yeah? I have a deal for you. You give me 100K back,
and I'll jump off this. 50 grand and you have a deal. 75! Sure! Just because I wanna see it. You're 100 feet in the air!
What are you talking about? Byron, you're crazy! I've been told that once or twice. Byron, you and your $425,000
are moving on to trap 4 out of 7. Take off your blindfold! Welcome to the Minefield of Death. Oh my God! Jimmy! Buried beneath this minefield
are 20 gargantuan bombs completely hidden out of sight. Come on, Jimmy! Your job is to drive your money
across the minefield, but be careful which path you take. Because if you
accidentally trigger a mine, all your money inside of that car
will burn to ashes. Roger that. But lucky for you,
you have 5 chances to save your money. You can put it all in one car.
You could spread ‘em amongst the 5 cars. It's all up to you. So, this is car number 1. - How much money do you want to put in it?
- None. Predictable. How about car number 2? 25K. You're putting 25 grand in? No, no, no! You can put it all in the last one
and just pray you don't hit a mine. 25K in this vehicle. - We'll go for it.
- Yes, let's go! And let’s put everything else
in the last car. Any sane person would not have chosen to spread their money
outside of the last car. But as I'm sure you've
already picked up on, Byron's not exactly what I'd call normal. So, one of the great benefits
to this challenge is that most of my experience
is with roadside bombings. I'm not sitting
in this vehicle this time. Wait, so you were in a car
that drove over a real mine? Yup. The terrorists buried
a roadside bombing too deep. And when it went off,
it just created a big bump in the road. I didn't know that!
Please tell me this doesn't give you PTSD! No, I mean… not really. Lovely. All right, anyways, to the Bunker! Ooh, buddy! And now, the remote control. Of death… It is rigged up to car number 1. Obviously, you hit a mine,
the car will blow up. Ok guys, here we go. He's moving! This first car has no money in it.
It's technically risk-free. But the more of the map you uncover
in this car, the better your odds are
of saving your money in the next car. You could take the right path.
You could take the left path. - I'm gonna go left.
- I'm terrified. There could be an explosion
at any point. Oh, no! It is not left. One car down, four more to go. But this time, $25,000 is on the line. All right, here we go. I got a hitchhiker! - Karl?
- What is he doing? Karl’s gonna make sure
your car burns extra good this time. I would really avoid
this next mine. Thanks, Karl! On this first path, he accidentally
picked the side that had the mine, which means the right side is clear. Do you regret putting
25 grand on this one? Yo, 100,000%. He now has another fork in the road. You gonna go left or right? Yeah, I'm gonna stick with the right. So far, so good. I could've just stayed in there. Two cars down and $25,000
of your money is up in flames. Do we have to talk about it? That amount of money could’ve bought you
a non-exploded car. Karl, he could kill you,
just so you know. No, I'm very aware.
I'm very aware. All right, Byron, you haven't even made it
halfway through yet. You only have two more failures before you send your remaining $400,000
down this road of explosives. At this pace,
you'll lose all the money. Oh my goodness. - Send out your third car!
- Here we go. You got this. You're the bomb. Just stand out there for the rest. Now you can focus better. So right now,
I am completely unable to see my vehicle. Oh, it's killing me that I don't know
where the mines are. - Any second now it could blow up.
- God, I don't wanna look. You're coming up on the next 50/50.
Big decision. You're going right? Yup. - My heart.
- Oh my God. I'm so nervous. Don't forget, the more mines you trigger
with your empty cars, the safer that $400,000 becomes
on your final drive. So far, so good… - What are you thinking?
- I'm gonna go left. What made you pick left? Uh, it's just a harder route. If it's hard,
I'm doing it. That's what she said also. - Karl, this is a serious moment.
- Sorry. This is intense. Over halfway. No bomb yet, but there could be several
between this car and the finish line. I'm gonna stay committed. Oh, he doesn't care. - You're just ripping!
- He doesn't care! So you now have a winning path. The question is, can you remember it? No, but we're gonna go. So, using his last empty car, Byron made
sure he had the route memorized. - You're good!
- Remember the route. Because for the final car, all $400,000
of his money was now on the line. Now that you know the path, I say
we do something special for the final car. I don't trust you anymore! This time, we're gonna walk
behind the car. Let's do it. Onward! So if you accidentally trigger a mine, now we'll get a front row view
to his money blowing up. - You sure this is the path you took?
- Yes. We're literally
in between two mines right now. That guy right there is our safety expert,
and he keeps telling us to back up. So Byron, can you back up? Why have a safety exp— - Karl!
- Jimmy! - Stay on the side.
- What're you doing? We're walking through a minefield!
I'm the wrong one? Keep driving! Wait, I don't know
if I remember the path. I actually don't remember
if this is right. Is it right or is it left? Wait, wait. Stop! Wait!
He's going so quick. You're one mine away
from ending this entire video. Uh, God! Stop! Stop! Congrats! Your money survived! Good job! It's on my neck! Yeah, ok here.
I got you. Don't— Don’t die. Don't die. - Wait, wait! The car, the car!
- Oh, the car! We'll stop it! Could you imagine
if that triggered a mine and blew up? - Oh, it's coming back!
- Wait. It doesn't have brakes! Jimmy said, ""It doesn't have brakes,""
and got behind it! Well, yeah.
I had to brake it. All right. Anyways, duck behind the car.
Duck behind the car. Why are we ducking? - All the mines you didn't blow up
- Oh, God. we're gonna blow up now. Let's go to the next death trap. We just walked there! Byron's a little harder to kill
than I thought. But seriously, he'll be terrified
when he sees the twist on this next trap. Byron, take your blindfold off! For this next trap,
you're gonna be buried alive. Oh my God. You're gonna lay in that coffin. Then I'm gonna seal it, cover you with a
ton of dirt, and reveal the challenge. Do you trust me? No. Whenever you're ready,
climb in the coffin. There's a hatchet there,
which you'll need. You won't be needing this ladder anymore. Watch out, Karl. Seal the coffin! I'm sorry, Byron. I can't believe I'm doing this, but I'm actually helping you
seal me in a coffin. Permission to bury you alive? You have my permission to bury me alive. Get to shoveling, boys! Oh my God! Oh Byron, I'm so sorry. No, you're not! While we're burying you,
check underneath your pillow. You'll have the greatest chocolate
in the world, Feastables. And the greatest meat snack
on the planet, Jack Link's. Yep, yep, I've got 'em. - You have big muscles, right?
- One might say. And big muscles require protein,
wouldn't you say? I would. Which is why the Duos I gave you
is pretty convenient, because it's protein-packed
and made with 100% real beef. Quite honestly, probably
in the most uncomfortable position I've ever been in my life. And at least I'm gonna have strong muscles
from my Duos. Oh, God! He's done. You are officially buried alive!
How does it feel? I've been better. As you can see,
there is a giant flaming furnace with a conveyor belt leading towards it. Pull the lever. Oh! There it goes. This is not your money.
This is test money. In a moment, this conveyor belt will start
slowly dropping your money into this fiery furnace. Behind your knee, you're gonna see an axe. You're gonna to use that axe
to break your coffin, somehow traverse through all this mulch, and turn that lever off. Which will then stop the conveyor belt,
AKA, stopping your money from burning. - Now, Karl, turn it off.
- Ok. Put his money
on the conveyor belt. I'll die before I quit. It's on you.
Give me a countdown! 3, 2, 1. Pull the lever! All right! Your money is officially
falling into the furnace! Good luck. Do you not feel bad burning his money? Of course I do. I feel like your actions
contradict your words. He needs to break
through the lid of his coffin. I need to get out of here!
Bro, it's getting everywhere. And while he's digging out of the hole, I wanna tell you about
Jack Link's new product, Duos, because it's actually
two separate flavors in the same bag. This bag, for example, has their
original flavor and their teriyaki. Boys, give it a try. I really enjoy the original and teriyaki. You wanna switch it up?
Go for the mango and jalepeno. Scan the QR code or click the link
in the description to buy now. Look at all his money
just coming up and it— Oh! Whoa. I just caught a dollar!
That was crazy! Some of you are gonna think that's fake,
but I don't even know how I'd fake that. Byron, your money's burning! This money is making his fire bigger. Keep going, Byron!
Get outta there! Over $10,000 of your money is burned! - Oh my gosh!
- C'mon! Oh, he's getting out! You got it! Oh, my gosh!
Don't cut yourself! Yes! - You're a monster!
- You came out like a zombie! He swallowed dirt! Before we go
to the next death trap, you let me know what you think of
Jack Link's Duo, their brand new product? These are legit phenomenal. Byron, I hope that jerky
gave you a lot of protein, because you're gonna need it
for this sixth trap. Welcome to the next trap. I'm a little bit nervous on this one. Behind you is your $384,000. Don't move. To the trap! Oh my God. What do you think the trap is? I'm going up somewhere. In order to pass this trap, you must scale up this 60 foot tower
while hanging this money behind you. And this trap is different than the last. It is all or nothing here. If you fall one time or drop a single bag,
just like in other videos like this, you will lose everything
and the video will end. But there is a twist. You don't have to carry all of it. To make yourself lighter,
you can leave some of the money behind. And all of this money
literally weighs 200 pounds. So it's up to you to decide
how much money to carry to the top. So one of the things
I'm thinking about right now is leaving it as high up
on this as possible. So if he leaves them
on that platform, that's basically 3 or 4 feet less that
he's gonna have to be pulling the bags. If he somehow cheats this trap,
I'm never casting an Army Ranger again. If you ain't cheating, you ain't trying. I can tell. I'm gonna be honest,
I don't think you can carry it to the top. Let's push this body
and see what it can do. You're crazy, man. I’m gonna go up top.
No shot he’s making it. A lot of people in my life didn't, uh, believe that I could do and accomplish
the things that I've accomplished, so my goal is to prove that I can. It's about that time
where you have to decide: How much money
are you going to attempt to drag up here? It's all or nothing,
brother. You are a psychopath. If just one extra bag is too heavy
for you, you'll risk losing all of it. You don't even want to just leave
50,000 behind? Nope. I'm going. All right, he's officially off. If he falls, the video ends.
He gets no money whatsoever. And as soon as all these bags
are suspended in the air, the full weight will be on his back. That's way heavier
than I was thinking. Look at this trail of bags behind him! He is literally climbing up a 90 degree
incline carrying 200 pounds of money! What's going through your mind? Ah, you brought the heat
on this one, Jimmy! He's going fast. Oh my God, he's falling. He is just brute-forcing it! Oh, God. All right,
the hardest part is coming up! Oh my God, almost there. Yeah, he has 200 pounds of money! I can't give up! Oh, gosh!
Let me get out of his way! Bro! This is insanely impressive. You have no idea
how heavy this is! Oh, you did it! You did it! Yeah! People don't realize how heavy money is. And when you have over 300,000 bills,
it adds up. You only have one death trap left between
you and me wiring you all this money. Oh, God. Jimmy. Let's do this. All right! To the junkyard! …where lies Byron's final obstacle
between him and his money. Are you ready? As ready as I'll ever be.
Let's do this. Why are you flexing? When I'm uncomfortable,
I just start randomly flexing. Ok! Take off your blindfold.
Welcome to the final trap. - You must protect your money right here
- Ok? from that bomb. Oh my God. I'm giving you three construction workers, Holy crap. - a ton of machinery,
- Ok. and you can use anything
in this junkyard to protect it. In 8 hours,
that bomb will drop. - Gotta go.
- Good luck! In past videos,
even when given 24 hours, contestants have failed
to protect their money. If Byron succeeds in a third of the time,
it will be a first in Beast history. So now we got to figure out
what's flammable, what's not flammable. This roof is plastic,
so that's gonna burn. We don't want that. You have a ton of hoods over here. - Do you think these will burn?
- No. So this could be, like,
your blast shield at the top. Yeah. All right, guys. I want to get as many of these hoods
over here as possible. If it burns, like, there's,
like, that felt on it? Rip— just rip that felt off. No fiberglass, no nothing.
It has to be metal and metal only. - Do you think this would be of any use?
- Not at all. But you can get rid of the plastic jugs
and use the metal. Uh, yep. Ok. So what you're seeing me do right now
is grabbing my cages that are going to end up
becoming my buffer. Now the flammable plastic is gone, he has this nice metal frame
to put around the money. That's smart. - Do you think these would be of any use?
- Not at all. Considering what the bomb
is potentially made out of and there's a liquid accelerant inside,
it's gonna burn fast, and this astroturf right here
is flammable. But it looks good on camera, though. I don't care. Ok. I figured he'd say that. They've gotta make sure they remove
everything flammable, because the bomb might increase
the temperature in there so much that it could light on fire. So now, we're gonna take this,
and we're gonna— Oh, you’re gonna make, like,
a shield with hoods. Yep, so bring in our containers. Then we're gonna start stacking them
as high as I can get them - Ok.
- creating a multi-story tomb of metal until, basically,
I'm told I can't build this any higher. You can build as high as you want. Ok, well, it's gonna keep going. Ok. Good luck! And as confident as he felt
about his plan, Byron thought there was still a piece
missing from his puzzle. We’re gonna create another layer of these
over the top of it, but I wanna get that money
as secured as possible. And I know I said the less I have
on there that's flammable, the better, but if it's insulated,
it may not affect the money at all. In Indiana Jones,
this literally survived a nuke. Yeah well, they don't make things
that way anymore. - So…
- Oh, really? You don't think this would survive? I mean… you know, it could. Well, I guess Byron gave
my Indiana Jones joke some thought, because it looks like
he just found the Holy Grail in money-incinerating defense. Oh, what is this?
What did we just find? Let's flip this. 1, 2, 3, flip! Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yes! So much “yes” right here. We're gonna close the money
inside of this, then bury it
at the bottom of my barricade. Now that Byron had everything he needed,
it was full steam ahead. Got it? So, yeah, we’re gonna start
laying those across, over the top. And I need cinder blocks stacked
in this dead space. All right here. The mentality that I have with things
is success or death, in everything. I don't give myself a plan B. You cannot have bravery
and courage… without fear. I'm not gonna, lie Byron's defense
strategy was looking pretty airtight. That was, until he decided to place a massive fiberglass boat
on top of his structure. That's a highly flammable object right next to the massive bomb
we're about to drop. Isn't the boat fiberglass? Oh, man… No fiberglass, no nothing.
It has to be metal and metal only. I'm genuinely at a loss right now. Time is up! - You all right?
- Yeah, yeah. Dead serious, like, just I'm seriously
just second-guessing everything right now. How you doing, buddy? Oh my gosh, Jimmy. Dude, you've literally buried me alive. You made me climb with over 200 pounds— Don't forget when we
drove through a minefield. Made me drive through a minefield. And I put you
in a room with a bear. A thousand pound bear.
Not just any bear. A huge bear. Absolutely everything comes down to this
last moment right here in front of me. Literally everything. The only thing that really matters
is always being a hero to my wife and kids but the influential mind,
seeing that fear is ok, it's what you do
in the midst of that fear. You can't have courage without… without being scared. $384,000 on the line
with your wife and kids here to watch, and it all comes down
to this explosion. Oh, man. - Are you nervous?
- Yes. I'm extremely nervous. Ok. Any last words? Let's do it. 3, 2, 1! Drop the bomb! Everything's on fire! Let's go! There’s so much fire! Byron, a bomb just went off!
Be careful. No! Oh, whoa.
That is burning. Go, Byron, go! It’s under the boat,
it’s under the boat, it’s under the boat! Oh, there’s still more! That is the fridge
he put his money inside of. All right, slowly bring her down! Moment of truth. It worked! Yes! - Yes!
- The money didn’t burn!! The money’s safe! Let's go! Yes! Yes! Oh my God! Congratulations! $384,000! 384 grand! We did it! This is gonna change
so much for us, Jimmy. I’m gonna buy a tractor
for the ranch. - Subscribe to MrBeast!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=figrl0aOULs,Click This Video To Feed 1 Person,629,20250412,en,"Every single time someone watches
this video, it helps feed someone in need. And since we get a lot of views, I brought a lot of people! Here you go. Thank you, friend. Yeah, no problem. If you're wondering how this works, every time someone
watches this whole video, including you right
now, money is generated. And as this video grows, that
increasing amount of money will feed an astonishing amount of people. Everybody eats. But that's not all it's going to do. Mr. Beast! You watching this video
will supply farmland, build massive kitchens, fill
schools with food for their students, and save children from child labor. So, honestly, I'm glad you're here. There you go. 1500
people have now been fed. I'm very excited for the future. And because of our meal program, the school attendance skyrocketed, so it only made sense to
upgrade their classrooms. They have so few desks at the school that some students
literally have to sit on rocks. I assume you're not supposed
to put four kids on one of these. Of course. This is only
supposed to take two kids. - Really?
- Not four. Can you ask them if they'd like new desks? [speaking foreign language] Yes! I'll be right back, then. Bring it on in! We got some new desks for everybody! And now, even with all these new
students, everyone has a place to sit. Look how happy they are! Let’s get to unloadin'! Bro, I love this video! This really puts into perspective... the things we take for
granted in America and Europe. Like, something as simple
as a new desk for their school so they don't have to sit on rocks... is literally making their week. - Thank you, Jimmy.
- No problem. This means a lot to me. All right, thanks for the help, guys.
They're carryin' all the way right now. You ready for your new desks? Yeah! Yeah? Obviously, they can't feed all
these kids breakfast and lunch every school day with... this “kitchen"". Which is why we built
this brand new kitchen! And on top of revampin' the school, we also dug a well
here with water storage, plus a greenhouse and,
pan the camera, a farm. We are hooking this school
up with everything they need. And for the influx of students
at neighboring schools, we're partnering with... Massive farms like this one! And this is Justice.
He runs the farm. Welcome to Oleleshiva farm. We have two parts of the farm. One part of the farm
goes directly to the schools, and the other part of the farm, we specifically grow to
sell to nearby communities, which helps to keep the nonprofit going. And because right now these
farms are using manual labor, which is not efficient enough to produce
as much food as the schools need... ...we brought you a brand new tractor! No way! Now, instead of people
doing manual work like this, they can instead just use this tractor. What previously took 45 minutes
will now just take 45 seconds. This tractor is more
important than you may realize. Just because we're takin' the
money from all the views on this video and giving it to school meal programs, doesn't mean food just
magically spawns outta thin air. The food has to come from somewhere, and in this case, it's comin' from
the increased yield on this tractor across this massive farm. And to be sure this food reaches
as many people as possible, we've got a special
surprise for the school. Everyone, come over here! Here are the keys to your brand
new truck for the community! Congratulations! What?! I want you to use this to
feed all of the community. Thank you. Thank you so
much! We have a new truck!! This truck will enable the
school to provide excess meals to families all over the community. And inside of your guys's brand new truck
is enough food for over 100,000 meals! The community was so
thankful they...gifted me a goat. I have a goat now. And if you thought
100,000 meals was a lot, by the end of this video,
because of your view, we will be giving away a million meals. That's Kenya for ya! Let's head to Ghana, where we also funded the construction of
not just another kitchen and water tank, but also a new farm for a local school. The cabbage we're planting here, in around
two and a half months, will look like this. We can feed the students just
from this small cabbage farm. But unlike this farm, the
millions of others all across Ghana don't share such a positive story. It’s a farming community. Most
of the parents are cocoa farmers. And sadly, the children are as well, playing a crucial role in
generating their family's income. Four out of five of your students, before they enrolled to this
school, worked on a cacao farm. Yeah. And now, instead of
working on a cocoa farm, they're getting an education just
because we're giving them a free meal. Yeah. This food is increasing our enrollment. It will bring the kids to school
and they'll stay in school, too. And... we found another
way to help kids stay in school. These are their brand-new cows. We bought dozens of pairs of animals that
we're gonna be gifting to these families, and with that extra income, they'll be able to send
their kids to school as opposed to having them work on farms. Tomorrow will be
their first day of school? Yes. Congrats! All right! And with so many animals to give away, I had to rely on Tareq for
help, which... was a mistake. Tareq, bring out the next
ten goats at the same time! Oh, man, that's a lotta goats. That's a lotta goats. Come
on, goats! Come on, come on! Here we go. Wait! No, no no! Somebody get the goats! All right, Tareq! Tareq! They got away. Tareq, you're fired. Congrats on your brand-new goats!! And I know the perfect way
to celebrate our time in Ghana. Have you guys had chocolate?
Tell me what you guys think of it! No problem. Do you like the taste of it? Yes! Do you guys wanna see the drone? Yes. If you look up, you can
see yourself on the camera! You are welcome, you are welcome,
you are welcome, my friend. It's sad, but 45 percent of children that live in to cacao
farming households in Ghana work in illegal child labor. So to fight this, at Feastables, we're working with the farmers
to establish Child labor monitoring and remediation systems to get these kids out of
child labor and into school. It's been our prayer that we have
school feeding for our learners, and now we have it. So, we thank you so much, and we
hope that this will continue for years. I hope forever. And now that these families
in Ghana have enough to eat, back in the United States, ending hunger requires solving
a completely different problem. Believe it or not, America
produces so much food, that almost 40 percent of
it simply gets thrown away. But if we can preserve
just ten percent of it, we could theoretically end
hunger in the United States. And that brings us to the Philadelphia
Wholesale Produce market... One of the largest food
marketplaces in America! Where every year, up to ten million pounds of unsold
food is at risk of going to waste. Which is where Evan and his
nonprofit, Sharing Excess, come in. And if they don't have a place to sell it,
it's the easiest option to throw it away. Let's take these potatoes, for example. Some retailer might be like, ""Hey, if they're within one month
of expiring, we don't want it."" But instead you're like, ""Yo! why
not give it to people who are starving?"" That's right. It's a no-brainer. So Evan and his
organization, Sharing Excess, collect millions of pounds of food that, for silly reasons, would
have been thrown away. What are we lookin' for? This looks good. That looks good, so we're
gonna put it in the good box. This one? This one looks a little... not good. Not so good. Throw it in the bin. Okay. And that's all you do? Yeah. If we make it more
complicated, people wouldn't do it. Wait, Tareq, why is your pepper so small? I think I got the biggest
pepper out of the boys! Everyone knows
this is what you do with your pepper. Wait. Your pepper's deformed, Nolan. It's, like, curly. Yo, the boys wish they
had a pepper this big. All this food is just what's been
donated today from this building. And there's even more out there. We need more trucks to be able to pick up all of the food that's actually available. This market and others like it, have so much food that even Sharing Excess Organization can't distribute it all
before it goes bad. But with just one more truck, they could rescue up to seven million
pounds of additional food, every year. And maybe you can see where this is going, but I made sure Evan couldn't as I led him to the surprise
that I had prepared for him. Evan, take off your
blindfold and turn around! Look at your brand new truck!!! Yeah! And again, just by watching this video, you're helping us give more
money to Sharing Excess so that they can continue to fill this
new truck with food for years to come. But let me show you what just one
day with an additional truck can do... starting with supplying the
Double Trellis Food kitchen where they cook gourmet
meals for the needy every day. Everything you see here
would have been thrown away, but now it is a gourmet meal going
to someone in need. This is crazy. And while the meals we
cooked fed 600 people, our one truck still had thousands
of pounds of fresh produce to stock multiple community fridges, hand out directly to
people on the streets, and even host our own
food drive in North Carolina, where hundreds of people
were in need of nutritious food. And you can help too,
with the help of DoorDash. By watching this video right now,
you're helping feed someone in need. And for a limited time, if
you purchase this hoodie, available exclusively at
DashMarts on DoorDash, you're gonna help to donate... a hundred meals like
this to people in need. I got some meals for ya. - Oh, I appreciate it.
- Of course. I'm noticing Evan's putting his
Sharing Excess branding over the... DoorDash hoodies. All right, here we go. Oh, there he is! Sorry, I had to pause the
food drive to settle that. Do you need a hat? Scan the QR code or click
the link in the description to purchase your hoodie on DoorDash now. Let's help as many
people in need as possible. DoorDash's Project DASH, in just a few years has helped to deliver over
a hundred million meals. All this food would have been
thrown away. Isn't that crazy? That is crazy. Hey! Do you watch the videos? - Yeah.
- Do you know his name? No. She took a picture of me! Hey, neither do we! And once the food drive was over, I
still had two more surprises for Evan. Evan, I have two checks for you. First, to get us to a million meals, here's a check for six
hundred thousand meals. Oh, my God... Before the video goes up, we
said we'd do a million meals. I need you to do six
hundred thousand of them. We're on it. And then after the video goes up... I don't know yet. It depends how many of them
watch the video. So here's a blank check. And as they watch the video, I will fill it in so you can
keep feeding people in need. Oh, my God. Guys, please watch this video. We could provide so much food! The dollar amount written
here is up to you guys. And not only did DoorDash
step up to help fund these meals, but so did a gentleman named Tony
Robbins who has a message for you guys. What you're doing is so important. Every view you watch is
gonna bring more meals, so I'm gonna commit
ten million meals to you, matching funds for anybody
who wants to join me here. Let's really do everything we can and
get as many people helped as possible. Make sure you share
this video with your friends. Because of Tony Robbins and DoorDash, every 20 views equals a meal to
someone in need. Let's share this."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKq8bkY5eTU,I Survived The 5 Deadliest Places On Earth,802,20250322,en,"I am currently on an
island infested with snakes! ...but I'm visiting way deadlier places. Like scaling a mountain covered in ice... I'm gonna die! Let me down! Driving a road that has
killed thousands of people... We’re like seven inches
from falling to our deaths. Swimming uncaged with vicious sharks... And so much more. All starting in this cage in the middle of an African
safari where there are lions, cheetahs, hippos and a dozen
other species that could kill us. Why are we doin' this? Because we're visiting the
five deadliest places on Earth. Oh, I see one of them. Oh, my God, why are we doing this? And to make sure the lions actually
visit us, I brought a bunch of meat. To spread And surround the cage with it. Oh, man, are we trying to die? But what actually makes
this place so deadly, is that when the sun goes down and
we lose our sight, the animals do not. Jimmy, there's two lions. That sound. Is that a rhino? No! Bro, it’s huge. Dude, everything's coming out at night. Bro, we're surrounded by lions. They're literally twenty
feet away from us. Oh, my God... These lions will not stop circling us. We might actually die in this video. Well, let's see if we do! Because the next places
we'll be visiting in this video will progressively grow more
and more deadly than the last. All leading up to an island
riddled with poisonous snakes. And next, we're going to be ice climbing
on this massive, deadly, frozen waterfall. And now there is no turning back. One way or another, we are going to climb this massive
cliff using these bladed boots and these ice picks. This might be the scariest
thing we ever do. Wish me luck. Jimmy, you really expect
us to climb this whole thing? Yeah. There's no chance. Truthfully, I wasn't sure
if we could pull this off, but what happened next with Nolan
did not make me feel any better. No. All right, guys.
Guys, stop! I'm out. I'm out. You can't quit! Watch me. I can't believe Nolan
chickened out. That is insane. Nolan truly left us. We're
really high up right now. You're almost halfway! Oh, Jimmy, don't look down! Oh, my God. It's gettin' steeper as we go. Oh, my foot! I’m losing grip. Oh, did you almost fall? Yes! Oh, God. I see the top, Jimmy! This is the scariest
thing I've ever done. I'm doing this. I'm gonna get to the
top. Show ‘em how steep it's gotten. We’re in too deep, I can't quit! I got like ten percent left. I'm fighting the urge to cry, man. Even though I definitely
shouldn't have been doing this... You're almost there, Jimmy! I somehow made it all the
way to the top of this waterfall. We made it to the top. Let's go!! You know what? Nolan had the right idea. But we'll see if he can handle
the third place on our list. All the way in Bolivia, where we'll be driving a road
where few make it off alive. And now we are on the
deadliest road on Earth. This rock drop is literally
as tall as a skyscraper. I am regretting this. I really am. No joke, so many people died on this road that they literally shut
it down a decade ago. This road was causing
nearly 300 deaths per year. But I got the government's
permission to reopen it just for us. I really wish they hadn't done that. Ah, it’ll be fine. I'm not sure that it will. I’m startin' to understand
why they call it Death Road. You're not driving like it's
Death Road, I’ll tell you that. Yeah, when your life is in my
hands, I don't like when you say ”Oh!” No, your life is in my hands. And
look, the steering wheel just jerked. Hands on the wheel, please! We're like seven inches
from falling to our death. You're getting too close to the edge. Please. Please, please, please, please! Oh, my God, my life is flashing! It's flashing over and
over and over again! And if you thought that was a close call, we're about to hit the first of the
three deadliest spots on our route. This is where the road gets very thin! This is the part you
gotta be really careful on. Oh, my gosh. Dude, I mean, the tire is going to
go off right up here. Do you see that? Yeah, I see what you're saying. Oh, my God! Look how far down that is. Here. Nolan, can you guide me? Gladly. I'll get out of
the car. Gladly, bro! Don't fall, please. No way! Look at how steep the drop is. That's a whole ravine.
There's, like, a waterfall. Yo, help me get through this. All right. Dude, this looks crazy! Look how close we are to the ledge. Your tire is literally right
next to this giant ravine. That is crazy. Watch out! It goes down.
It's very slippery. Keep comin'! Nolan, you're not really good
at this whole “directing” thing. I mean, I feel like I'm just running
away from the car at this point. Not much direction that I can give. All right, get in the
car. You're useless. Okay. You get in, too. I'm 'bout to speed up. Nolan, you know what might
make this ride a little more fun? What? Our brand new Feastables
Creamy Peanut Butter Cup! Oh, I thought you were
going to say you driving slower. No. Oh, jeez! It's getting so foggy
coming up. I can barely see. At some parts, the road
is actually pretty normal, but due to extreme elevation
change here in Bolivia, sudden blinding fog can
roll in as a silent killer. All right, stop, stop, stop. It’s the edge. Am I good, Nolan? No. It actually looks like they're
about ready to fall. It is so close. Okay. So, like, right here? Good? Just stay as far away Ah! What's that noise? It's closer than I prefer, but... I thought, why don't we mix things up and
come out with our own Feastables cups? No! You see, the best part about these cups is that we use peanut butter straight
from a jar, and look how jam-packed it is. These things taste amazing. And on top of that, we use
Feastables chocolate in this. Which, if you don't know, at Feastables,
we pay all our farmers living wages. We use Fair Trade certified beans.
We remediate child labor on our farms... Oh, my gosh. This is very bumpy. All three of which no big American
chocolate company does. Nolan. It's been like a decade. Can you
go make sure that bridge still works? All right. I just really want to make sure if it
collapses, you know, I'm not...on it. All right, Nolan, test
the bridge! Am I good? It's good. Big Chocolate pays farmers so little that they're forced to
literally use child labor. No joke, there's over a million kids
in illegal child labor in West Africa just on cocoa farms. So not only should you try the new
cup because it tastes phenomenal, but also help me send a
message to the chocolate industry. Pay your farmers a living income and do more to get rid of
child labor on your farms. This was crazy! We survived Death Road! So far, we've survived on the land. But for this next bonus place, Karl and Nolan are in the middle
of the ocean surrounded by sharks. And we're gettin' in the water
without a cage for some reason. Yeah, we usually use this
thing, but now we're not going to. The sharks in these waters are
notorious for unprovoked attacks, making this the most dangerous
water in the United States. I can't believe this is happening. Oh, my gosh. These are gigantic
sharks. Oh, my God! Dude, why are we
doin' this without a cage? Dude, behind you, behind you! Oh, my God, it's huge. Nolan, get in now! I don't want to! Hopefully I don’t die. I
don’t wanna die today. Oh, my God, that thing is so big. Okay. All right. All right. Karl, the sharks are,
like, twice as high. I'm good on sharks. I'm good. But that was nothing compared to
our second most dangerous spot. Which just so happens to be in
the middle of the Amazon rainforest, the beauty of which can only
be paralleled by its danger. Because in a matter of moments,
the forest can go from this... to this. Just a little rainstorm can
cause the rivers to flash flood and overwhelm the entire area. And today we're visiting
the Gocta Cataracts waterfall, where a flash flood could send us down
over 1,000 feet... to our watery grave. And to join me on this cloudy day... I brought these guys! You'll remember Hase, he spent
seventy days in the wilderness, and Bailey spent 100 days
trapped together in a cube. What we're about to do
seems more up his alley. They said the chance of death is low. - Wait, what?
- Not zero? Come on, boys, let's hit it. And after hours... And hours... ...of trekking through
some of the most slippery and at times, steepest terrain
mankind has ever set foot on... Nothin' to see. ...we finally made it to our destination. That's a waterfall... right there! Like if you slip, you're dead. And with the help of a guide, we
were able to cross the river safely. Hey, look! And then we were secured to some ropes so that we could look over
the edge of the waterfall. Can you see over? Wow! This is so gorgeous! But as I said before, for
how beautiful this place is, at only a moment's notice... it can be just as deadly. And it just started
downpouring like crazy. You know, this is why this is one of
the most dangerous places in the world. This waterfall is now
becoming wider and wider, which are creating flash flood conditions. So we're literally getting flooded out
of the Amazon right now. We gotta go! Should we use the ropes to go
down the side of the waterfall?! I don't think so. That's
really a bad idea, Jim. We're going to be in the woods. Isn't
that just equally as bad? What's the risk? There's mud coming down
on Jimmy’s line. Like, a lot. And at any point, they
could be struck by lightning. And I really don't want you to die. So with our YouTube video
turned emergency operation, the only way out was through
the same steep and slippery terrain that got us here, and now we had to do it while
the entire forest was flash flooding. You can see the flash flooding.
Now the path is blocked off. We’re gonna have to
rope off multiple parts 'cause it’s gonna take us
hours to get off this mountain. Do you remember when I crossed
this river and I was laughing? I'm not laughing anymore. I'm actually scared. And if I fall, that's the
waterfall right over there! Look at this water.
Like, seriously, no joke! Grab the rope and pull yourself up. Don't let me die. And after hours and hours
of trekking through the floods and muck, we walked away
from this mountain with our lives. Now we're headed to the
most lethal corner of Earth. The number one spot on our
list of the world's deadliest places. And what better way
to end this video, boys, than the most dangerous island
on the planet... Snake Island! Why are we going to an island filled
with killing machines? We might die. Bye-bye! And we are now officially
stranded until tomorrow. That's right. We will be spending the
night on the most deadly island on Earth, and with lethal snakes
hidden beneath our every step, these specialized shin guards
were our only hope of protection from their venomous bites. So there could just be
snakes anywhere here. Yeah. Jimmy, what happens if
one of these snake bites us? Basically, as soon as the
venom enters your bloodstream, your skin melts off, and you
could be dead in under an hour. Well, it's kind of terrifying to think
that I could just die at any second. This is wild, bro. You know, for an island full of killing
machines, this is actually very pretty. This is so beautiful from up here. Man... If you fall right here, you're dead. Yes. I see that. Boys, be careful. You'd think that with a
name like Snake Island, there would be thousands
of snakes out in the open. But after killing all of
the ground animals, the snakes now hunt the birds in the trees the island's only remaining prey. We are officially entering the jungle. At any point now, a snake could
jump from the tree and bite us. I was just worried about my legs, but now we've gotta be worried
about them falling from trees, too! This is insane, bro. There's one right here. There's
one right here right next to my face. By capturing the snakes, scientists can extract their venom
and create anti-venom with it. Wait. That's venomous. Yeah. So if that bit me, I would die. Yeah. Hey, make sure you got a good grip. It's a juvenile. Oh, no. No! It's gone. You... dropped it. No, it escaped. It escaped. But... He’s as chill about dropping
that snake as I am when I drop my phone. And the further in the jungle we get... These bushes are too thick. I can't see two feet in front of me.
A snake could pop out any second. The more snakes we see. Here and there... This time, let's not lose 'em, okay. Okay. Scoot back. Scoot back. How many lives will the
anti-venom from that snake save? Thousands of lives. Oh. That's insane. The anti-venom they create can be used to treat 90 percent
of all snake bites in Brazil, which means every snake we catch
could mean thousands of lives saved. Hey, Jimmy, there's
another snake up there. Oh, my God. That one's huge! We’re finding 'em all
now. They're coming out. So for the rest of the day, we helped find these deadly snakes,
and we even assisted the scientists with their research. So that snake is about 15 feet in the air, and the scientists propose we
shake the tree so we can get it. There's no way I'm
campin' under those trees. That thing ain't moving, dude. We need that anti-venom.
They can save lives. At this point, it was getting dark,
and we needed to focus on survival. Time to build camp. Camp is now set up. Full disclosure, I have
no idea if these tents are snake proof. We'll be sleeping among the snakes. A little bit scary. About to go to sleep. Hopefully a snake doesn't
slither in my tent tonight. This is terrifying. I can't wait to be in the
safety of my own home. So, we woke up with
one thing on our minds.... Getting off this island as fast as we can. I just wanna go home. From hanging off the side
of a massive ice mountain to driving inches away
from a 1,000 foot drop, swimming in shark infested
waters with no cage, and lastly... We survived Snake Island, and no one died! Thanks for watchin' the video. Make sure you go try the brand-new

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zajUgQLviwk,"Last to Leave Their Circle Wins $500,000",2318,20250301,en,"Behind me are a hundred circles
with a hundred people inside of them. I don't care if this takes
weeks, months, or even a year. The last one of you to leave
your circle wins that $500,000. The rules are simple: If at any point
you cross the red line around your circle, you lose half a million dollars. The challenge has officially started. Good luck. Right back there, that's a half a
million dollars. I got nothin' but time. This is my home from now on. You can't take me out of this
circle even if you wanted to. Five hundred thousand
dollars all for myself. I flew 27 hours to be here, so I gotta last at least
27 hours, as far as I see it. Believe it or not, this challenge
is much harder than it looks because after only 30 minutes in, this happened. We have our first elimination! Oh! Somebody touched it. Someone touched the line? I'm so nervous. Throw it on the screen! T.J.! You touched your circle,
which means you are eliminated. Someone's gotta do it,
and I'll take the sacrifice. All right, you're free to go. Chandler, you weren't the first out! - You're right.
- I'm proud of you, Chandler. I wasn't the first, but
I will be the second. Wait. What? Wait, wait, wait! Whoa! All right, now there's two out. And if you're wondering why Chandler and a bunch of other
familiar faces are competing, it's because every star competitor
from all of my videos are here for the biggest crossover
in MrBeast history. Everyone here has been
in a MrBeast video before. They know what it takes to win,
so it's very tough competition. I watched the 1 to 100 video.
42 is the biggest threat for sure. This is the lady that jumped
off the platform, and um... Eliminated 99 people. Yeah. Is this bigger than your
house in the woods, yeah? It is literally bigger than
me and Grizz's house. Throw him in here with me. Let's do it. And on the back of everyone's shirt
is all the money they've won and lost in previous videos. So Lannan here has lost
$200,000, $250,000, $1 million, a $2.5 million private jet, and
another million dollars to the cube. I like hanging out with Jimmy ‘cuz
he reminds me of all my failures. And our next elimination happened in the
most surprising way I could have imagined. Oh, heck no. - Big Justice got out!
- No! Why’d you get out? You didn't
want to use the porta potty? No. Okay. Porta potty got someone out. - Thanks for having me, though.
- No problem. This was a big BOOM! This is a last-to-leave video, so all these contestants will literally
be sleeping in their tiny circle. Except... it seemed
like Gio had other plans. And if you've seen our videos before, you
might already know what he was planning. I’ve played these games before! Trying to keep everyone from sleeping
seemed like it was actually working. That’s it. I'm outta
here. Good luck, guys. I'm tired, and I'm going home. This isn’t an old man's game.
This is a young man's game. This one was too much for me. And they weren't the only ones, because while they were sleeping, seven
people accidentally touched the red line. And one of them was
none other than... Karl. I woke up with this big
toe touching the line. After the first night, 14 players had already lost their
chance at half a million dollars, and more are about to go during
this all-time favorite next game. Guards! Bring in the blocks! Oh, here you go again! Oh, no. Towers. - Woah, no.
- What? No! Because all of you are
very experienced players, it's only fitting I bring back one of
the hardest games we've ever done. This is how I got out on Beast Games.
This is not gonna happen again. All I need you to do is build
a tower on the red block. Make sure your tower is very sturdy. I’ll come back in a couple minutes. I've seen this on Beast
Games, and it looks so hard. I don't know how I'm gonna do this. I don't see a lot of people comin' out
of this. Hopefully, I'm not one of them. Or hopefully... I am one of them. In the wilderness video, you
guys were against each other. Are you working together now? I trust him right now. Can I give it a jump test or no? Yeah. All right. Well, if you
hold it. That's not... Get outta here, man. How's everyone feel about their tower? Yeah! Yeah! Control room, throw up a 24-hour timer! Starting now, if your tower falls over in
the next 24 hours, you will be eliminated. Oh, my God. And to spice things up... guards!
Hand everyone a dodgeball. - Oh! No way, bro.
- Oh, my god. When that 24-hour timer hits zero, the lights will turn red, and
you will have exactly ten seconds to throw your dodgeball
at someone else's tower. If you knock it over,
they will be eliminated. Make sure you make some friends, because you probably don't want 20 people
throwing their dodgeball at you. Let's figure out who we're gonna take out. Hopefully you trust your neighbors.
We created a nice little pact here. Dude, there's some people on
our perimeter I don't really trust. Someone can throw a dodgeball at
my tower, and I can get eliminated. I’m tired. I want to sleep. But I don’t know how can I sleep. But some people didn't sleep, focusing instead on guarding their
tower against the challenge ahead. It's officially day number
three, and I'm kinda scared for it. This is a game of endurance, so
I've just been sitting here... waiting. Because this is an endurance challenge, a few people inevitably
touched the red line. And one player literally
got eliminated by a raisin. Not only did he touch it, but then
he proceeded to caress the circle. Well... That's a half-a-million-dollar raisin! But the majority of this time
was spent forming alliances and deciding who they were
going to target with their dodgeballs. That's the thing. You don't
know who's aligned with who. Who's gonna try to defend each other. It's almost time! Yo, who are we thinking of throwin' it at? Jeremy. I saw him on TV. I feel like he should have
made better decisions. There's a couple people on my hit list. It's Rayne. I know Hugo’s not gonna do
nothing, but aside from him... Or is he? After nearly 24 hours of all
of you protecting your towers, finally, one minute remains. You had ample time to form alliances, develop a strategy,
figure out your enemies. This is gonna be crazy! Three. Two. One. Go! Joey! Jeremy's down! Mark’s out! Are Rayne and Hugo out? All right! And, cease fire! Cease fire! If your tower’s standing, you're still in! Let's go! I can't believe I survived, dude. All right, Jeremy. You lost
in Beast Games, and now you might be the first person to lose to
Joey and not be a hot dog eating contest. You can leave. All right, Mark. You can head out. But by far, the most brutal elimination
is when Hugo eliminated Rayne. What you just witnessed is
what I would call instant karma. Hugo, what do you
have to say for yourself? Maybe if she woulda cooked a
little more in the bunker, helped out– Hold on, Hugo. Don't act like
I didn't clean up the bathroom, mop the floor... You two should just leave.
You’re good to head out. All right, take care. And to the rest of you, you can kick your
tower over! You survived! Get some rest while you can, because
tomorrow, half of you are going home. This isn't just another
last-to-leave challenge. The 62 people you see here
have all competed before. Some have won hundreds of thousands and others have lost everything. So the only question is:
Who will last the longest? Slept a little better tonight now that
there's not a giant tower in my circle. Jimmy said that we're gonna
eliminate a lot of people today, which... I'm down for
whatever challenge comes next, because we need to thin the numbers out. At the end of the day, only one
person’s gonna take home the $500,000. Attention, everyone. I have
an announcement to make. I hate to do this, but half of
you are about to go home! 50% of us going home. Absolutely
diabolical. I'm so scared right now. Yeah. It's terrifying. I'm
probably going home. I'm just hoping it's a game
of skill and not a game of luck. We have a line going
through the middle of the room. Since they're putting tape down, it seems like they're dividing
the room into four quadrants. We're gonna try to figure out a way to
make sure that half of the room that goes. In a matter of seconds, Gio
and I are literally separated. Yeah. This is, by far, the worst
I've felt in this challenge yet. And now all of us are about to
get out in less than 30 seconds. We have now split the
circles into four quadrants. We are going to be
playing a game of hot potato. I'm going to start a one-hour
timer that none of you can see, and at the end of the one-hour timer, the two quadrants with these balls
inside of them will be eliminated. Everyone, get the balls out. There is a lot of strategy
in this coming-up game. It's up to you to work with your team to figure out the best
way to keep track of time if you want any chance of moving on. I'll give you a little bit
of time to strategize. Who wants to count? We need to keep track of the time somehow. One person’s counting the seconds.
The other person’s counting the minutes. Because if we get enough people counting,
the average should be pretty accurate. Do you think they're gonna
be able to time it perfectly? Not in the slightest.
Yeah. They said that they need
“counters,” and I can't even count. Yeah. There's no way you can guarantee
a perfect count, especially to an hour. You know, you can maybe
get close for a minute. We are panicking.
We have no idea what to do. There's 100 different strategies,
and now everyone's, like, freakin' out. And after we spun to see which
two quadrants got the balls first... Orange team! Green team! Three, two, one. Go! The 60-minute timer has begun. How long you holdin' on to the ball for? I'm holding it on ‘til to
the last second, baby. Well, what if you hold on to it a
second too long? Your team's out. Well, I've got multiple
different counters. Oh, these are the counters over here? We got counters in the back. 2, 3, 4. This entire game... Six. ...is reliant upon your team's
ability to keep track of time. Eleven. If you're just a second off, they
could hold the ball and you all go home. They're trusting their teammates
to count, to stay focused, to be right. But what if they're not? Orange team thinks it's been
nine minutes and 20 seconds, but green team's on ten
minutes and 15 seconds. We already have a minute
difference between the two sides. I'm hoping they're
holding the ball too long. It goes red while
it's still in their hands. Because that's the thing about time. No one here knows
exactly how much they have. We're locked in. Everyone's quiet. Drum major. Are you guys gonna throw at each other? - No, no no. We're not...
- No. We're going. And while some were trying their
hardest to keep track of the time... How you feeling? Dude, as soon as those balls get
thrown, time goes out the window. It's just gonna be a frenzy. ...others would inevitably
try to throw them off. 52, 53, 54. 200, 242 Go back to the grocery store, Alex. 947, 931 Noah. We're done. Noah, send it. Send it? Hot potato! Oh, he threw it! - Josh! Throw it.
- Throw it? All right. Get the ball! Oh, no! All right, let's see where it goes. Okay. Okay, okay. They hit a camera! What happened to the film on it? Why is the ball green? - Oh, what a throw!
- Oh, my god, he went out of his circle! - Oh, he ran out. He ran out!
- I'm already out. Whose side will it be on
when the timer hits zero?! Minute. Go, go, go! Go, go! Get it over! Get it over! Get it over! Get it over! Get it over!
Get it out of the zone! Oh, my God. Kick it! Oh, this is chaos. Throw it, throw it, throw it! This is chaos. When its timer gonna be up? Hit it! Hit it, hit it! No! They’re both over here. Let's go! I tried to keep track. I don't think anybody really in here had a proper count with how
much chaos was going on. When the lights turned red, both balls were in the yellow quadrant. I'm sorry, but you guys are eliminated. As for the other three of you, we'll be running it back, but
this time with a ten-minute timer and one ball between
pink, green, and orange to figure out which is the other
team that will be going home. Oh, boy. And before we settle the tiebreaker,
six of you stepped on your red line. If you see your name up
there, you are eliminated. Hell nah. Bret. Oh, he took his shirt off. Bret! Put your shirt on! I don’t–
I don't know what's going on. Don't encourage this behavior! No, don’t encourage this. That was the most intense game
I've ever played in my entire life. And getting the ball first is... orange. Three. Two. One. Go! The ten-minute timer has now begun. When it hits zero, whoever's
quadrant has that ball will be eliminated. You’d think after the first round,
they'd have this figured out, but nope. Same panic, same confusion.
Just a little bit more desperation. What time are you at? I’m at like 9, but they’re at 7. She said she's at nine,
but they're at seven. Which one are you trusting? We'll let you know, Noah. Hold it. Hold it, Noah. - Hold it, hold it!
- Chaos! Chaos! Chaos? Chaos! Dude, you should have listened! Oh, it's going again! Oh, he got out! Oh, hit it out of your
quadrant. Hit it out! Throw it! Gio! Oh, my God. Oh, snap, this is good. Throw it, throw it. Nice. How much time is left? Oh, my God. Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it! Akira just saved the day once again. Pink team, you guys are
eliminated and can now head out. See you, guys! Dude, that was the most heart-wrenching
thing I think we've faced so far, man. We'll bring out the Lovesacs. I’ll
have another game in the morning. So it's day five. Energy's feelin' good.
You know, we got a good night's sleep. Everyone is acting
maybe a little too confident. I think at this point it's gonna
start getting pretty intense. Now we're all thinking about
our chances of winning $500,000. If it comes down to me or another
competitor, I'm not gonna hesitate. Before we can play the
next game, look at the screen. One of you stepped on your red circle. Oh, nooo! Who is that, bro? Yo! Josh! No! You've spent five days
in this circle for nothing. I have one thing to say to everyone here. Obviously, this is not
how I expected to get out, but the right person’s
gonna receive that money. And as for me, Imma go
get my wife pregnant. Later! What? We're a family-friendly
channel. Gio, close your ears. All right. You heard nothing. For this next game, we're
gonna be randomly pairing you up. You're gonna be goin' head-to-head with a
different circle to eliminate each other. That's crazy. I want to reveal the first two circles
going head to head: Asma and Arlene. Guards in the back, bring
out the balance beam! Will you please connect
these two circles for me? In between your circles is a
balance beam and two gold balls. The first contestant to grab
their ball, and return to their circle will move on, while the
other will be eliminated. And if you both lose your balance
and fall, you will both be eliminated. Three. Two. One. Go! All right, they're off. She's going quick. But she might fall! Or she might not. Graceful. She’s beating you! You gotta
hurry! You gotta hurry! Yes! I don't know if I’d celebrate just yet. You guys, look at this screen over here. She won, but then literally one and a
half seconds later touched the red line. They have both, sadly, been eliminated. I celebrated too hard. Guards! Set up the next game. Preston versus Noah. Noah, are you ready? I'm ready. Preston, are you ready? Yeah. Well, before you go, I want to let you know that
Shopify is the best way to start... Jimmy, can you say go so I
can get on this balance beam? Noah, do you want to start a business? Yes. Well when you do, make
sure you use Shopify to build it, grow it, and manage it, okay? Shopify all the way, baby. Let's go. Go! Shopify has literally
powered my businesses since I had 3 million subscribers. It’s what I used to sell merch on. It's what I started selling Feastables on. Basically, anything I've ever
sold online, I've used Shopify. Noah touched it first. Oh! Oh, my gosh. That was a blowout! Let's go! I want to help you start
your own business as well. To get started, go to shopify.com/MrBeast or scan the QR code on his face right now. I'm gonna be buying random
products from 100 stores that start a brand-new business. Never been a better time. Go do it. Reveal the next
opponents... Gio and Nicholas. If you lose, that means
you lost to a 12-year-old. I won’t let that happen. Gio, are you gonna win this one? I’m gonna cook. I'm gonna saute. I'm gonna deep fry. Good luck. Go! All right, they're off. Oh, he's beating you, Gio. He's beating you. Oh, he fell! All right, Gio, just
don’t fall. Don’t fall! Don't fall. Don't fall, Gio! Don’t fall! Yeah! Let's go, Gio! Let’s go! And as more and more
players were eliminated... ...we arrived at the final game. Rami and Akira. Who's going home? You or him? Unfortunately, it's gonna
have to be Rami today. He's standing in the way
of me and 500K right now. Now, Akira is known for doing
many challenges, and he's won plenty. You just won a brand new Lamborghini. I did win a Lamborghini.
That's pretty cool. I will beat you no matter what. Akira, any last words? It's go time, baby. Any last words? I don't care what you've
done, my friend. It's over. Oh, the best for last! Three! Two! One! Go! You can't talk all that
smack and lose! You can’t! Pleasure doing business with you, baby. I am here in the top ten
to prove that I belong. Top ten, baby. We got top ten. Ten! Top ten! After five days and 90 eliminations,
we had narrowed down to our top ten. A week ago, all 100 of these circles were
filled, and now just the top ten remain. Yeah! Let's go! This top ten is stacked
with Beast veterans. We have Los, who's been in several videos Akira is back from Beast Games. Ronnie competed in Laser Maze. Noah did 32,000 curls. Omar took his hand off the $1 million Gio was in both of our
Ages 1 to 100 videos. Alicen left her previous
circle for an iPhone. Julia lasted 20 days in the wilderness. Gabrielle was in the top ten
for a one up million dollar island, and Mallory actually
won that $1 million island. And because each of you have
already competed in my videos, we are going to do something
I have never done before. For this next game, I'm going to let
the ten of you pick the game yourselves. Oh, God. Oh, no. It could be a game of chance. A game of skill. It could be who jumps the highest. Whichever game gets
the most votes, we will play. And I need that game
to eliminate half of you. We'll give you guys some time to mingle. Just remember, $500,000
depends on your decision. That’s wild. We pick the game? The faster we come to an agreement,
the faster we can get this over with. Would anybody want to
do Rock, Paper, Scissors? No! I'm not taking chance. I'm not taking a chance for 500K. No. All right, I got an idea. How about
we do a bench press competition? No! No! Guys, I say we do one foot! Who can stand on one foot the longest? That's actually a really good idea. First five to drop off one foot? Okay. Yeah, let's do it. All right, we got it! Jimmy! We have a game! I am a dancer... but I won't tell them that. You guys want to leave
$500,000 up to balancing? Well, before we play--
Patrick, come on in. This is our standards and practices guy. You're gonna have to explain
exactly what the rules are. He's gonna be the one upholding them. And in case you were all are
wondering, for these challenge videos, we have someone whose literal
job is to make sure they're fair. You gotta pick one leg.
You can't change legs. You cannot use your
other foot for support. If your foot touches
your other leg, you’re out. If you agree with the rules
Noah laid out, raise your hand. Oh, my gosh. Okay. Any last words?! Cuties! Love you! May the best men win, guys. Three! Two! One! Go! And the game is off. There's a timer on the screen... Let's see how long it takes for
five of them to touch the ground. Okay. It's been 10 seconds. It is dead quiet in here.
No one is talking. Wow. Do any of you guys want some Feastables? I'll take one. There you go, help distract you. ‘preciate it. The cookies
and creme is hittin’ Yeah.
That's good. I have a theory that if I say, ""Buy MrBeast merch,
buy MrBeast Labs Swarms, everything you can find
MrBeast-related. Yeah. Feastables. Like this? Yes. I get a 50%
plus chance of surviving That's not true. But I
will put that clip in the video. I'll come over here. Hi, Jimmy. Hey. Okay. If your foot touches the turf,
you lose half a million dollars. I’m aware. Okay. How long do you think you could
oh, okay. How long do you think you could go? I don’t know. 20 minutes? I don't know. An hour? Maybe. Five hours? Maybe. Could go a day? Could go a day. I would say his toe's maybe two
inches off the ground right now. All right, well, now it's
five inches off the ground. I see a little shake-age in the feet. He's not responding. He is locked in. And that seems to be
the case for everybody. And with laser-like focus, they
were about to close in on five minutes of standing on one leg... but not before our first elimination. Ugh. Gabrielle! 4 and a half minutes! Yeah. Even though I didn't
win, I feel fulfilled. Last time, I made it to
the final ten for my video, and I felt like I gave it my all
this time around. I'm proud of it. Back-to-back top ten. Yeah. Congrats. C’mon. Thanks, Jimmy. Appreciate it. Nine remain. Oh, I'm seeing some shaking over here. I'm not gonna lie. My calves are burning, and if my calves are burning,
I know everybody else's is. Why are your calves
burning? You're... a gymnast. You're wobblin' more than
anyone else here. What is going on? Yo, no. Los is wobblin' a lot. Los is dancing all over the place. While this challenge may look simple, after a certain point,
comfort does not exist. And after lasting over five
minutes longer than Gabrielle... You're good. You got this, dude Los was feeling just that. No! Los! That's a second one down! It was tough man. What gave out? My hip. My ankle. It was fair. I didn't know
I was gonna cave that hard, but... Oh, actually, she's
about to touch it. I'm sorry, Mallory, it's not looking
good for you over here. You don't think? I could see that foot
shaking from across the room! I'm good. But just to make sure, we
decided to review the footage. You can listen to what I'm saying. Mallory over here. Do you
think you touched the ground? I don't-- if I did, I don't feel
it. I don't feel my legs at all. If you look at this shot right here. You'll see That counts as a touch. Yes. Okay. All right. Mallory touched the ground. Three people have been eliminated! And with two eliminations still remaining. Bye! It has been over 16 minutes. Everyone here wants it badly. Let’s see how far
they're willing to take it. We're gettin' some hoppage over here. Minor hoppage Oh wait, there's some hopping over there. I'm seeing hopping
everywhere. Omar's hoppin'! Omar, I'm seein' a
lot of movin' over here. How bad's the leg burnin'? It's okay. And Omar wasn't the only one
feeling fatigued, because Ronnie... Woah. Are you sweating? You see that? Oh, my gosh. He is
sweating a pool over here. Don’t lose, Ronnie. We got this, bro. My foot is burning. Stay strong. Oh, my gosh. Bro, how
much pain are you in? I can literally see every strain
of your calf moving right now. He wants it. And as time crawled along, things weren't getting
any easier for Omar. How bad is your calf burning right now? It's okay. I'm going to
do this no matter what. He is literally half an
inch off the ground. Breathe, Omar. You can do this! Don't give up! 23 minutes has gone by. Will Omar be the next to
drop, or will it be Ronnie? Y’all are doing great.
Almost a half an hour. That's crazy, actually. And with resolves truly being tested, we had to review footage once again... but not for who you're thinking. Everyone, I have footage. Someone
has touched the ground. That someone... Thought so. If you look right there... Yeah, I did. See that? Yup. Julia is out. Six of you remain! Which one of you will give up
first? We're goin' until we find out. Truthfully, I would say out of
everyone, Akira is shaking the least. He is not moving an inch. Omar is constantly jumping around. It looks like Ronnie is really struggling. I’m not gonna give up.
I’m gonna do this! And this seemed to be it. As the clock was reaching 38 minutes, he and Ronnie were
reaching their breaking points, and both were on the verge of collapse. I'm sweatin' up a storm. I've been drippin' since,
like, 13th minute, bro. Don't think about your
leg. Just don't think about it. Jimmy, I can't do this. You got this. Breathe.
Find your balance. Oh, he's out! He's out! The five of you are now movin' on! Gio! Yeah! Oh, my god, yeah! Top five, bro! Top five! You gave it everything. That's what
you gotta keep telling yourself, okay? Be proud of yourself.
You fought to the end! Hey, Alicen. You're an animal, dude. I'm the last girl. Cuties! Hey, Omar. You're a beast, man. I heard you fightin’ for your life
down here. That was incredible, bro. That was amazing. I will say I regret keep
d-doin' that challenge. Are you getting flashbacks to when you
took your hand off the million dollars? This was the moment to
redeem myself, and I couldn't do it. I would not beat yourself up too much. You definitely gave it everything you had. Thank you so much, Jimmy. No problem. I’ll walk you out. Walk out with that head
high, you did amazing bro. All love, Omar! Now that you've made it to the
top five, I'm gonna give you a choice. You can choose to play a final
game that will eliminate four of you, giving us the winner of
this half a million dollars. Or you can choose endurance, and we settle this like a
traditional last-to-leave challenge. Let's do it, man. Endurance
all day. Endurance. Keep in mind, if you choose endurance, you could be stuck in these circles
for days, weeks, or even months. We'll have one minute to either
write ""endurance"" or ""game."" Start the timer! What do you think? Game or endurance? I wanna play a game. I
wanna end this on a high note. Think we played too many games. This is the last leave the circle
challenge, and I think... endurance 30 seconds! They’re all so sure. It's up to the five of
you to decide your fate. I think I'm a tie-breaker What are you feelin'? I don't, I'm torn. I don't know yet. You wanna be in here for a month? Do you want to win $500,000?
You wanna listen to a 12-year-old? 20 seconds left! They don't want to be here any longer. That means they're
gonna leave before you do. 15 seconds! Hey, look, the 12 year
old's gotta go to school. You wanna be out of here?
You wanna take a shower? Come on, don't listen to them. I know it's a big decision. Alicen. Five! Listen to your own
self. Don't listen to them. Two! One! Time is up. Drop your markers. Akira, what did you write? I wrote ""game."" Gio. Game. Noah. Endurance Ronnie. Waitin' it out, baby. And the tiebreaker is... Game! Yes! Let's play a game! Woo! I'll go set it up. Hey, can you see my sign?
This is what I really chose. You shoulda picked endurance. Yeah. I'm sorry. Hold on. Everybody's gonna roast me to
pieces if I lose to a 12-year-old, and honestly, it doesn't
matter what challenge it is. At this point, I feel like
I'm a challenge beast. It's fine. We’ll have fun.
It'll be fun. It’ll be fine. No more friendships. It's all about
who's winnin' this one right now, and I'm walkin' out with that money 100%. We’ll all have fun, and
we'll all be friends after this. Alicen let a 12-year-old manipulate her. 12-year-old's not going home with money. We're locked in now We're locked in, bro. I wanna kill her over there. 100%. Oh, we're all going to hate each other. In order to play this final game, the guards will be moving
your circles to a new location. Stay calm and be careful,
because the rules still apply. If you leave your circle, you will lose half a million dollars
and leave it for someone else. You guys have defeated 95 competitors, lived in these circles for over a
week, and it all comes down to this. Feast your eyes on your
very own mannequins. That's me, bro! I've equipped each of you with
a different color paintball gun. On my cue, all five of you will
fire one shot at the same time. If your mannequin gets hit, we will shrink your circle. After three shrinks
you will be eliminated. Oh.... It is up to you who you wanna aim at. I think Akira is coming for me, 100%. He's not going to say it out loud,
but he's intimidated by me for sure. I got a pretty big target on my back. I have a feeling some of them
are gonna come after me early on. I gotta make my shots count. I'm just gonna hit the cleanest shot I
can, just try to hit every single target Akira and then Noah, I think So I didn't tell no
one, but I play airsoft. You're awesome. Are you guys ready?! Yes! Yeah! Let's do it! Guards! Load the rounds. You get shot three
times, you're eliminated. Last one standing wins
half a million dollars. Game on, baby Let’s go, baby. I'm ready. Three! Two! One! Fire! Oh, my God. They all missed!
Every one of them missed. They fire a little higher than
you aim, so that’s good note. But now everyone clearly saw
where I was shooting at so... Hey, Alicen's goin' first. Alicen. Alicen's goin' first. All right. All right. If they're all three going for her, I might as well aim for
someone on the right. Guards, load the paintball guns! Three. Two. One. Fire! Oh, somebody got hit. You got hit. Oh, my gosh! Ronnie got hit. That's a hit. Oh, wait, Akira got hit! My leg! Wait, who’s yellow? Let's go. Wait, Ronnie, you shot Akira? Let's go, baby. - And Akira shot Ronnie.
-It’s a good shot. Shrink their circles! Stood on one foot for
38 minutes yesterday. We're good. My money's
going towards kids, so... y'all are takin' it outta
their hands as well. I'm a kid! Load their gun! $500,000 on the line. Three! Two! One! Fire! Oh, he got me in the nuts. Akira got hit in the nuts! It’s what I was going
for the first time too The only person who got
hit was Akira in his genitals. That's brutal. That's personal. Shrink his circle. As you can probably tell, Akira, next
shot, you will be out of room to stand. This is true. This is your last leg. Your last life. Akira, they might be missin'
on purpose to let us battle it out. You got two targets already. You might want
to put one on somebody else now this time That's true. I'll go Alicen this time. Hey, we agree to go Alicen
if he agrees to go Alicen? I'm down. Three shots right to her. All three of you? You were the one who
chose this game, girl. Are you agreeing to target
Alicen like the rest of them? Yeah. I have to. Yeah. This is my last round. Love you, guys. Love you, too. Guards, load the guns! Three! Two! One! Fire! Ronnie stuck to his word and shot Alicen! Hit her right in the nuts. He hit me in my nuts. Oh, my gosh. Wait, wait,
wait. What is this? Wait! Ronnie! What color is it? It's blue. End of the day, it’s
only one of us can win. You're goin' down, bro. This time
I'm goin' right for your forehead. I gotta take him out. If I take him out and he goes
down with me, it's a poetic way to go. I shoulda knocked him out.
Shoulda knocked him out. We’ll see what happens Load 'em! Three! Two! One! Fire! Oh, my gosh. All right. Akira got hit
right here on the side. Then if you look over
here, Ronnie also got hit. The two of you were so stubborn that you
cost each other half a million dollars. Game's the game. He's already got a Lambo. I needed that. We both battled our hearts out. We got this far. Looks like one
of these three deserves it more. I feel like you shoulda been standin'
there instead of the cardboard. Tough, man. I'm sorry. Akira. Ronnie. You both
have been eliminated. But if it makes you feel
better, you can drop your gun. Here's ten grand. You're
not goin' home empty-handed. Doesn’t make me feel better. Oooh! Ten G’s! That's a dub! Boys, remove Akira and Ronnie, please. Three players remain! Let's keep shootin' Three! Two! One! Fire! Gio hit her right in the chest! Yo, Gio was holdin' back this whole time. When do you become John Wick? Alicen, you're one shot away
from losing half a million dollars. Three, two, one, fire! Wait. It went through
Gio’s head! You were hit. You sure you want to keep
dukin' it out with Alicen? What if you hit Alicen here,
she hits you one more time? Then it’s mister no circle
versus you with two hits. Noah’s got nothin'. Guards, load 'em! Three, two, one, fire! That's a hit. That's a hit. You're eliminated. Noah, hell of a shot. Gio, you're the youngest contestant to
ever get this far. You can make history. - I could.
- You can do this. Alicen, here's your
10,000 dollars in cash. Thank you. Nevermind. Bye, Gio! Nolan, do you mind knockin' it over? Did he just tackle a girl? I think now would be a great time, Gio, to hear from your father! Come on in! Oh, my God Your son is this close
to half a million dollars. How are you? I’m so amazing. - Are you having fun?
- Yes. Whether you win or not, you
have literally shown the world, like, how incredible you are. You have truly impressed
everybody. Like, you've... Does that, uh... does that
make you wanna go easy on him? No. That was absolutely heartwarming; but they're not my family,
and I came here to get mine. Oh, my gosh. This is gonna be good. Guards, load their guns! $500,000 on the line. Three, two, one, fire! Oh! Gio landed a hit! Yes! Right on the neck! Guards, bring out the circle. You had a lead. Now it's a tied ball game. All of a sudden, you
both went quiet on me. All right. Load 'em up. You guys fought hard to be
here. Don't let it be for nothing. Three. Two. One. Fire! Come here. Noah hit the foot! Hit- he just hit Gio! All right. Shrink Gio’s circle! That is Gio’s second hit. You are one shot away from $500,000. This kid is not gonna
miss too much. I gotta put one on the target real fast. Guards, load 'em up. $500,000 on the line! Three. Two. One. Fire! Oh, my God! Gio! You hit it! I can put my finger through the hole. Bro. You can't make this up. Dude, it's tied up again. Oh, my gosh, I'm gonna barf. It is now tied. We are now one shot away. Oh, my God. Yo, Godspeed, bro Hey, yeah. Good aim. That's all love, man Their circles are shrunk to the max. I cannot believe this. But next shot wins half a million dollars. This is the most important
moment of both of your lives. Will it be Gio or will it be Noah? Who is walkin' away with
this $500,000 right now? Three. Two. One. Fire! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Gio won! Oh, my God! He won! You won! Hug your Dad! Hug your Dad! Your son just won half a million dollars! Come on in! Gio has had one of the most amazing
journeys of any competitor we've ever had, always standing out amongst their peers. You outlasted this entire row And winning the hearts of
everyone they competed against Save Gio! Save Gio! Because Gio never gave up, they are now the winner
of half a million dollars! This is so crazy. Oh, my God!"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDsO1LT_0lw,I Spent 100 Hours Inside The Pyramids!,1302,20250208,en,"I somehow have unrestricted access to all of the Great Pyramids of Egypt! No, this is the coolest
thing I've ever seen. We'll be going into the
tombs of ancient pharaohs, places that are literally ilegal to enter because they're incredibly dangerous. What if we fall? Oh, yeah, you'll definitely die. We’ll even be swimming to a secret
underground tomb beneath the pyramids. Oh, my God! We've only been granted
100 hours to explore, and we're gonna start right now! Follow me, boys! It's about to be fun. This is so beautiful. Someone 4,500 years ago
put this rock right here. Correct, this pyramid dates
back to about 4,500 years old. The passageway we're in leads to what
Egyptologists say is King Khufu's tomb: the pharaoh who may have
ordered the pyramids to be built. This room is called the Grand Gallery. What percentage of this pyramid
do you think we've seen so far? We might never know
the answer to that question. That's the coolest way
he could have answered that. This next room was the
king's final resting spot. As far as we believe, yeah. Let's do it. Holy crap! Boys! What is this? 4,600 years ago, this chamber may have contained
the king's mummified body. This is where the pharaoh was buried. This is what we believe
is the final resting place. Believe? How do we not know? I think somewhere inside this
pyramid, there's another chamber that we have not found yet that
might have the body of the king. You know what? In this
video, we're gonna find it because we will literally be exploring
from hundreds of feet below the pyramids up to the highest point in the
largest ancient pyramid on Earth. That was awesome! Before we go explore the other giant
pyramids, I wanna show you guys base camp. - Yeah!
- This is nice. We got a dinner table, some tents to sleep in, and... Okay. We even brought lights so you
can see the pyramids from camp. That's gotta be the most expensive
nightlight that's ever existed. This is the pyramid we're
gonna explore tomorrow. I wanna start at 5 a.m.
Everyone get some sleep. These pyramids were so
technologically advanced for their time that some credit them to
a pre-Egyptian civilization, while some point to even
crazier theories like aliens. But Egyptologists are sure that
they were built by the first Egyptians as tombs for their kings. And by the end of this video, we're gonna
find out which of these theories is true. All right, boys, I hope you're ready
to explore the next pyramid on our list, the Pyramid of Khafre. What is special about this monstrosity? Well, this pyramid is how we learned
how the casing of each pyramid look like. This is how they all
looked like at some point. That was right after
the aliens built them. No aliens! Rami led us nearly 100 feet
below the Earth's surface, deep into Khafre’s pyramid. This is a place where hardly anyone
in the modern world has ever been. So to be honest, we had no idea
what to expect going down here. The ancient Egyptians had cardboard. We believed that this was the
burial chamber for King Khafre for the longest time. And now they're using it to store stuff. Well, they're restoring the
pyramid, Jimmy. They gotta use tools! So that means there's
a real burial chamber. Yes. Rami actually took
us to the real resting place thought to have once held
the body of King Khafre. I see a big ceiling. Dude, we’re deep in this pyramid. Here we are... ...the final burial
chamber of King Khafre. No, this is the coolest
thing I've ever seen. What the heck, bro?! What is this? Wait. Look at the date. The graffiti right there is the
guy who discovered this tomb. He claims he discovered this tomb, yes. This is where the Pharaoh was buried. This is the final resting
place for King Khafre. Is it disrespectful to lay in there? I wouldn't worry about the
disrespect so much as much as the curse. What does the curse do to you? Do you wanna try? No. All right, let's get out of
here before we get cursed. Oh my gosh, that pyramid is insane. The king's tomb didn't really
answer many of our questions. However, the portal to the
underworld deep beneath the pyramids could have everything we were looking for. This is the tomb of god Osiris,
where very few... Oh my gosh. ...humans have ever been. What are we doing? As you can imagine, the god of the underworld's
tomb is pretty deep underground. Oh, heck no. It really just goes all
the way down there. After you, Karl. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Why is he walking down so-- so nonchalant? This is the entrance, Karl. Yeah, to the god on the underworld! This is a tall ladder. It's actually really
deep. Like, if you fall– - Oh, yeah, you'll definitely die.
- Yeah. This is gettin' pretty scary. I don't like this anymore. And if we weren't already scared
enough, we then came across this. 3,000 year old Human. Oh my God. 
Why am I still holding this? - Dude, is this a part of a skull?
- This is a skull. Yeah. Oh, my God. When we go down there,
we will be so far underground that there's a chance we pass
out due to a lack of oxygen. Correct. Chandler is heading
to Osiris’s resting place. All right. Here we go. Oh, I'm in the water. You can tell it's– The
air’s pretty thin down here. Wait, what is this? Oh,
there’s a rock right here. Is this a rock or lid? Right in the center of the room
is the sarcophagus of God Osiris. Right here is supposedly
the gateway to the underworld. Yeah. So try to get in. To the underworld? Well, yeah. Screw it, screw it, screw it. Screw it. Oh my God. This sarcophagus is allegedly
the portal to the underworld, and virtually no humans
have ever been here before. - How deep was it?
- Oh, my God! Why am I here? 
Why– I’m a YouTuber. What are we– Look all the way to that
right corner up there. That's a shaft that goes
to nobody knows where. Karl, get up in there. Shou– I can go up there? Jimmy, don't let him. I'm so scared, bro. Karl, that's not smart. Dude, I'm literally in a tunnel in ancient
Egypt that nobody's ever been before. No one is crazy enough. Can
you explain to us what's happening? I'm in a turn in the cave. And it's gettin’ thinner. Dude, I'm literally, like, actually... like, actively kind
of stuck in this thing. Karl, you're making history. I got, like, one inch of clearance, bro. It's been longer than
the safe limit for oxygen. Can we get out? I'm ready. So before we literally all die and
see the underworld for ourselves. There's no gracefully
doing this, is there? We got out of there as quick as we could, because I want to live long enough to
explore the never-before-seen shafts of the Great Pyramid of Giza, Where literally less people in modern
times have been than have gone to space. Who wants to ride a camel with me? Let's do it. Pet ‘em. Pet ’em. He doesn't want it! Have you ever been bit by a camel? Yes. What? Yeah. Does it hurt? Yes. I told you! Another big day of exploring ahead. This is unbelievable. Chandler, you good? No! Pull it. Pull it. I can't. 
Give me off this thing, bro. Dude, it looks so good. This is probably one of
the coolest shots ever. Me just riding a camel by one
of the Great Pyramids of Egypt Bro, this is absolutely insane. And now the director of
the entire Giza Plateau is joining us for the
third pyramid on our list, the Pyramid of Menkaure. If you look at the bottom,
you'll still see some of the granite from 4,600 years ago remaining. Here's an illustration of what
they think it used to look like. But now this is all that
remains almost 5,000 years later. This is my friend Nolan. Can-- can
we send him to go scout up there? Yes. I got permission to do
something normally illegal. Nolan, be careful! Can you just, like, started
yelling at Nolan? He'll freak out. You don't really get many
opportunities to climb a pyramid. I’m gonna take it, bro. Get down! Get down, now! - Get down.
- Down? Yes, down. All right. Nolan, not a bit. You gotta come down. - Come on!
- Yeah, I’m going down. Get down, now! Yallah! Yallah! All right. Hey. He's kidding.
Keep going. He’s kidding. - Bro!
- That was a joke. Oh my God. You had me freakin' out. Oh my God, I thought I was
gonna get arrested or somethin'. Lead the way, sir. Let's do it! Wait, wait. Point the camera down there. Why is it so dark? We have switched the light off. Oh. Okay. That would explain it. All right, lead the way. The initial descent of the
pyramid took us down a shaft over a hundred feet below the ground to the very first chamber
in ancient Egyptian history to have decorative carvings. What is this? A decoration of false doors. We didn't have any decoration inside
any pyramid from the First Dynasty, except this one. So this was done four,
five thousand years ago? Four thousand six hundred years. Furthering our journey
deeper into the pyramid, the next shaft brought us to Menkaure's... antechamber! There's so much history in here. What's in that room? I can tell you, nothing there. Have you been up there? No. Then how do you know nothing's up there? Because I can see from here. Oh, yeah. You see? Just a tunnel. Nothing there. - Okay. Yeah, you can see the...
- Yes. Always be skeptical. The Pyramid of Menkaure, known for its complex passageways, had one final descending shaft
that led to the burial chamber. So this is the king chamber, and it has
a vaulted ceiling to relieve the weight. And how did they know
that 5,000 years ago? If you can build a pyramid, you can build anything. You can do anything! You can do anything. On our way out, I got to thinking, why is there three more
pyramids outside next to this one? What are these three mini pyramids? Menkaure, he got three small
pyramids for the Queens. The wives. So Menkaure had three wives.
And these are their tombs? Yes. Nolan! Come over here. Nolan. Oh God. If he can have three partners,
you can at least find one. It's a work in progress. I did discover a mummy.
She's not asking for money. She's always listening to
you. Never talk too much. It's a good choice for you. Did you just offer me a mummy? Yes... The things we do to find you love. Our time with Ashraf was coming to an end, and before he left, I wanted
to hear his take on this. So aliens didn't build the pyramids. Aliens?! Come on, don't break my heart! We have 124 pyramids all over of Egypt! So each time I am calling aliens, “Come build a pyramid for me.” 
Cannot be like this. Egyptians. - Yeah.
- We are the builders. Tareq! What? Don't bring up aliens again. You did! Egyptians built it. If you can build a pyramid,
you can do anything! Yeah! Let's go! And by anything, I guess that
also meant a massive half-human, half-lion mountain of a sculpture, which I'm sure is crawling with secrets. And now we're at this Sphinx with Dr. Zahi, the man who
basically found everything here. I read online that there's a
temple buried beneath the Sphinx filled with gold. And I'm on a
mission to find out... who is right? Dr. Zahi, or all the conspiracy
theories on the internet? Okay, hear me. Yes, sir. Help me! Is that an entrance? Yes. I cannot believe I'm entering the Sphinx.
I want to see if that temple's real. I'm not sure I’m gonna fit. You will. Whoa! This is cool. All right, let's see if
there's any hidden gold. Uh... Zahi, I just see an empty hole, Then I need you to give
a statement right now. I need a statement! All right. Zahi, there is
nothing inside the Sphinx. Jimmy, you are going to make history. And what better way to make history
than by leaving a message for the future? How long do you think this
paper will survive down here? Thousands of years. - Really?
- We will dig it now With the letter, can I
bury this gold Swarm? Perfect! This is worth $10,000. Really? This is for the future. Yo. And I guess the internet
conspiracy theories are right, because the Sphinx
definitely has gold in it now, thanks to the rarest
Swarm in the entire world. Guys, I'm trusting you
not to steal this gold. At this point, I was starting to
wonder what the other boys were doing until I heard this sound above me. Zahi, do you hear some helicopters? I can't believe we're doing this! Somehow, the boys convinced
the Egyptian military and government to let them fly around in helicopters while Zahi and I were
exploring the Sphinx. This is an awesome day. But the coolest part of this
entire experience is yet to be seen. When you take us to the
top of the Great Pyramid, you're gonna show stuff on camera
that you've never shown before. Amazing things. No spoilers! Bro, this video is gonna keep
getting better as we go on. And before we climb
to the top of the pyramid, we thought, what better way
to look for more hidden secrets than in a place that
almost no one gets to go? Rami, where are we? We are at the tomb of Iymery, one of the places that is
completely illegal for people to go in. That's why you’re gonna unlock it. Before we go in, it's
extremely, extremely important... Yeah. ...not to touch these walls.
Do you hear me, Nolan? Loud and clear. You should stay out here. Just maybe. Hey, Finger Food. I will not touch the wall. - Finger Food? What does that mean?
- You’re a wall toucher. Wall toucher? Hey, Butterfingers. Ready? Yeah. I thought I had seen it all, but nothing could have prepared me
for what I was about to see in this tomb. Guys, come in here! Oh, my gosh. Oh, this is beautiful. This was the tomb of
the high priest at the time, which is like the Pope of the time. No one is allowed in here
because these colors cannot be hurt after surviving 4,600 years. This drawing is 4,600 years old? -Exactly. 4,600 years old.
- It’s everywhere! In tombs like this one, it’s sometimes
more important than the pyramids for us. They explain the daily life of Egyptians. This is the one we figured out
how ancient Egyptians made wine. Really? They’re stomping on grapes up here. And going through the
process to bottling the wine. So this is like a YouTube
video, but 5,000 years ago. This is a how-to video. Dude, this is the most
beautiful room I've ever been in. Wait, Karl. There's more over here. Whoa! What is all this? These are normal ancient Egyptians
giving all the normal offerings, <i>ta and henket</i>, brandy
and beer, to the high priest, Iymery. How do you think the high
priest would have reacted if they offered season two MrBeast
Labs Swarms that are available now? I think Iymery would
very much appreciate it. Much like the buzz around
Mr. Beast Labs Swarms season two, our fourth day in Egypt
was just getting started. We're kicking things off by
going to the Workman’s tomb and joining an active excavation. Today's gonna be a great
day. Let's have some fun. The only thing that can make this moment
better is some Feastables chocolate. Ooh, wait. For all of us, maybe? Yeah, you can look at the pyramids. Man, that would hit with
Feastables, though, probably. And so, with only 22 hours left, I thought we'd upgrade from
camels to something a little faster. - Alright, Jimmy, you ready?
- Yeah. Floor it! This is insane! So sick! Yeah! This is way too much fun. Let's go! Crazy being
by the pyramids right now. Why’d we ever ride camels? I feel like I'm in Indiana Jones. We are now at the workman's tomb. Let's see if we can find one. And who better to show us
around the workman's tomb? Once again, Doctor Zahi. These are the tombs
of the pyramid builders. According to Zahi, this is literally where the people
who built the pyramids were buried over 4,600 years ago. In many other tombs, Jimmy, you see beautiful paintings.
But these people are poor. This is-- this is so beautiful. This man, his name is
<i>Nephyr Thys</i> And I know what you're thinking. Just because the writing on the wall says the people who built the
pyramids are buried here, it doesn't actually prove that they were; and I thought the same
thing until I saw this. Wait wait, wait. Is that what I think it is? Is that a skull? Zahi, I need to ask you something
because they're gonna question this. You did not put this skull here? No, no, no. This is the
exact location of the skeleton From 4,600 years ago? Yes. Yes. We have not moved it at all. And you're letting me excavate it? Is that a spine? Yeah. Well, we found out
that all the skeleton here of men and women had
a stress on their back. Okay. Why? Because they were moving two-ton blocks? Exactly! Very smart guy. 
Those? Nothing. Yeah? You're not say anything! And this is why you keep saying
that aliens didn't build the pyramids, because the worker's
bodies are literally here. This might be the coolest
thing I've ever done. Thank you for having me do this, Zahi. And tonight, we still have
an insane adventure left. We will reveal many secrets
for the first time to the world. He's not joking. We will literally be ascending to the
highest point inside the Great Pyramid, where less than 50 people
in modern history have been. This might be the best day ever. Perfect! But before we ascend to
the top of the Great Pyramid, we need to recharge our
energy back at base camp. Do you know why I
gathered all of you here? Ancient Egypt? More important. The season one of Swarms is almost over. Right here is every single
Swarm currently in existence. And this is the last time
you'll ever see them. Are these not the coolest
things on the planet? Yes. Rami, do you have kids? Do you think they'll like some of these? I think they will obsess
over them for the rest of time. Grab whichever ones you're
missing from your collection, because once they're
gone, they're gone forever. Oh, this is cool. You can find Swarms at Walmart,
target and Amazon in the US and around the world in top toy retailers. The last batch of season one
Swarms are flying off the shelves, so make sure you get them
before they're gone forever. Do any of you have a hyperchrome?
We only made a thousand of 'em. Wait, what, uh-- what is this? Okay. Well, Karl took it. And now what you've
all been waiting for... We're finally going to ascend
to the top of the Great Pyramid. This is the part of the pyramid
we're going to be climbing to. Wish us luck. And to make sure we
explored this entire pyramid, our guide suggested that
before we go to the highest point, we make a stop at the very lowest point hundreds of feet deep below the pyramid. Why are we going down this 300ft tunnel? Well, you asked for things
that no one else does. Why didn’t the pharaohs just
build a nice staircase to the top? Because they wanted to protect
their mummies and treasure. That's the whole point of a pyramid! Pyramids make me
regret being six-foot-five. Yeah, dude. That was a stupid choice, Bro, look how deep that tunnel goes! I hate being tall! Please tell me we’re
halfway there. Please. - No, nowhere close.
- And he wasn't lying. This tunnel kept going
for hundreds of feet. But after almost an hour struggling
through these narrow passageways... My knees. Jimmy, this feels like we're buried alive. We finally made it to the bottom. Whoa, I can stand! Rami, is it normal to be lightheaded? Well, you just crawled down over 300ft. I have bad knees that hurt. Whoa. This is pretty huge. When we first discovered this, 
we came into here, this massive chamber, 
and nothing was found. Why was it empty? It’s another decoy. They went through all this effort
just to create a decoy chamber? Correct. Which makes you wonder. Is the chamber we found the real chamber? Is it also a decoy? Which would imply that Khufu's body could
still be in here somewhere in the pyramid. Proving that the pyramids were
built as tombs for the kings of Egypt. But this decoy chamber also included
the deepest point in all of the pyramid. Guys, I'm gonna be the
person that's gone the deepest. I'm at the lowest point of the pyramid! And now that we've been to the lowest
point of the pyramid, let's go to the top. From here at the bottom-most point, the same long passage took us
to where we can meet Doctor Zahi and begin our ascent
to the top of the pyramid. Now, I need you to choose the
five people that they will go with us. Only five? Five. Who’s staying behind? All right. Rock, paper scissors. Shoot! No! Hey Nolan, it was nice knowing you. Hey. Fair and square. And so from there, we somehow
ended up back in the corridor we went through on day one
to get to the King's Chamber. We started the video off going
down this tunnel; but to end the video, we're going to the hidden
chambers up above. In the last 5,000 years, less than 50
people that we know of have been up here. Is this a bad time to
say I'm afraid of heights? I couldn't think of a worse
time for you to tell me that. And let me tell you, it was
not easy getting up here. The top of this ladder led
to another tiny passageway. The final hour of the challenge, and we're making a journey
to the top of the pyramid. This is hard. Good, Jimmy. Good boy. I’m not gonna lie, I thought
this would be much easier. What is this over here? We are in the third chamber now. We have two under us, but the most important one are
room number three, four and five. Now room number four. All right, let's keep her going. Okay. Let's go. Chamber number four. Karl, look at this. We're about to head to
the tippy-top of the pyramid. This is now my favorite video ever. Isn't it awesome that Nolan’s not here? Yeah, that's my favorite
part of this entire thing. But anyways, let's head to the top. Let's do it. Oh my gosh. Zahi! Yes? How did you do this? I have no idea. And just like that, we are now at
the highest point inside the pyramid. We made it, Chandler. Oh, my gosh, there's so many bats in here. This is not how I wanted the video to end! We got, like, two minutes left;
and we’re being attacked. Jimmy, come here! This is one of the names of
the gangs who built the pyramids. <i>Heber</i> means ""team"". <i>Simsu</i>
means ""friends"". <i>Cartouche</i>, Khufu. Khu fu. This means “the group
friends/gang of khofu,” and that was written 4,600 years ago. Exactly. Throughout this video, we have learned as much as we
could about the origins of the pyramids. And the Egyptologists have shown
us the best evidence they could find. - Egyptians...
- Yeah. ...we’re the builders. from the workman's tomb to
the skeletons buried nearby, which had all been
affected by manual labor to looking under the Sphinx
for secret rooms and treasure, There’s not aliens down there. to researchers, this graffiti
is the nail in the coffin for anyone who doubts that ancient
Egyptians built these pyramids as tombs for their pharaohs. This is the end of our adventure. I have no idea why Egypt
let us do all the things we did, but I'm eternally grateful. Shout
out to this country. You guys rock. Escribe for MrBeast. It’s subsc..."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sF5LYGgKbUA,Every Minute One Person Is Eliminated,2086,20250125,en,"Every minute, one of these
20 contestants will be eliminated and lose half a million dollars. Start the timer. Okay. What are we gonna do?  Like, do we just stand here? Every 60 seconds,
someone gets eliminated. The only context they have is
what's displayed on their tablet. Let's see if they figure it out. It says to vote for someone. Who do you guys wanna vote for? Is it vote for someone to
stay or someone to leave? I don't know. Who are we gonna vote for? I think I'm in shock. All of our numbers are on there. 10 seconds to elimination. Oh, no! I don't know, dog. That's insane. We didn't get any context. Oh, my gosh. Three. Two. One. Since half of you could not
agree on someone to eliminate, someone has to now
randomly be eliminated. You're kidding me. Hopefully next round,
you can work together. Oh, my gosh. No! Oh, my gosh! Bye-bye. I’m feeling nervous. Every minute, someone
will be eliminated. Start the timer! In this video, time
is not your friend. Constant pressure forces
split-second decisions that could make or break your chance
at winning five hundred thousand dollars. If no one votes for
anyone, then it's just odds. Yeah, more than half of us
have to agree to drop one person. Let's see if they can
make a decision this time. And the one thing that these
contestants all have in common is that they competed and were eliminated
in my global hit series on Prime Video, Beast Games. I don't wanna drop
through this platform again. And some of them even eliminated
others to win money for themselves. We gotta vote for the people who
already have money from Beast Games.  It’s 17, 12 and 2. 
Those are the three numbers. Okay. I feel like some people deserve to
get eliminated if they took the bribe. A couple people ain't
experienced the drop yet. With the fear of
random elimination... Everyone vote. ...the contestants knew they'd have
to team up to control the situation. 17? Yes. Yes. 17. We’re gonna vote 17. And this is just one of seven
intense social experiments that these 19 contestants will face. I don’t know why
I did that. I just... Where time is their
number one enemy. Five. - Oh, my god!
- Four. - This is crazy.
- Three. Two. One. All right. Let's see if you guys could
agree on who to eliminate. Come on, guys. 17 received over half the votes. We just wanted to
give him the experience. There are 18 of you left. But who was the one
who won the 100,000? Start the timer.
Let's make it 17. So 12 took a
bribe for 100 grand. Snitch. A hundred thousand dollars. Let's go, baby. It was clear that the best competitors in
Beast Games would be the easiest targets. Everyone knows that
12 got a 100 grand. Why you keep
talking about me, bro? You got your loot,
man. I'm voting 12. So for the next few minutes,
they worked together to eliminate... Start the timer. ...anybody they
believed deserved to fall. Goodbye, everyone. 
I love you. Six people have
now been eliminated. Okay. This is crazy. Did you expect something
that wasn't insane? And now I think we
should mix things up. Guards! Come on out! A guard is now going to be
going to each of your platforms and putting a bag on your head again. Kidnapping's illegal, Jimmy. We have a reason. What's the reason? Yeah, what's the reason? Bag them! All right. Here we go! Contestants, take off your hood. Welcome, everybody. This is crazy. We brought back the
cubes from episode three. Oh, my gosh. Oh, this is gonna
be interesting. We're going to give you the opportunity
now to talk to each other privately. Oh, baby, I'm about
to be plotting out there. Inside of each of
your cubes is a phone that you can use to call
any of the other players. Use this time to form
alliances and pick sides, because we'll be eliminating
three of you after this. This might be your only opportunity
to speak privately with each other. Please take advantage of it. I'm not going to call anyone. Why? I feel weird being disingenuous. And do you think
that's the right strategy? No. Number Ten's decision
to stay off the phone, unfortunately, made her the
first target for everyone else. Who are we going?
Who we going with? Are we thinking 10? Yeah. I'm feelin' good
about voting her out. Let's start ten and then go from there. That's an alliance right there. And spread the word, though. So player 14 got busy
plotting against number 10. This is Amelia. Hey, I've been hearing around... I feel like the
consensus has been 10. Okay. Yeah. 
That works. Number 10’s name is Jenny, 
and I have nothing against her, but everyone is saying that
they're gonna vote for her. While player 14’s strategy was to
turn everyone against number 10... Hello? This is number 19. 
We taking out number 8 first. ...Player 19 had a
different strategy as she was trying to turn everyone
in the cubes against each other. Hey, this is 8. This is number 19.
Let’s take number 10. Let’s do ten. So you guys are
going to vote out 10? No, I just told her that because
I’m making these fake alliances. I’m going for number 8 first, then
number 10, then number 9. I'm pretty much playing
everybody against each other. They're not my real friends, so...
I don’t care. I just wanna remind all of
you that $500,000 is on the line. Yeah. This was your only
chance to speak privately. I hope you were able to
form alliances with each other. They will be crucial
in this next part. Guards, bag their heads! Let's go back to the pillars. Take your bags off. Start the
timer. You guys know the deal. 60 seconds. One of you will go. This is so scary. Notice how they're all quiet this time
around. What, did you guys form teams? Right here. - Ten?
- Ten. We gotta choose something soon. My gosh,
this is so stressful. There's 10 seconds left. She's talking. No one seems
to be talking back. Kind of crazy. Oh, dear Lord. Time's running out.
Get your votes in. Three. Two. One. Time is up.
Reveal who got the most votes. Number 10. Okay. One thing we are doing
a little different this round. Before we drop you, you can choose to
take any one of these people down with you. Do you wanna get revenge? 
Do you want to be spiteful? Or do you want to just
go out on your own? They'll take themselves
down, I guess. That's kind of cool. 
Drop her! Start the timer! We're just
gonna keep rapid-firing it. Let's see if they have another player in
mind or if things start to get fragmented. We know what to do. Yeah. We talked a whole
bunch on the phone, guys. Okay. Enough was
said in the cubes? Depending on who
you are, it's good or bad. 8, are you good? God, this is
so rough, man. Three. Two. One. Basically zero words were said, but
somehow you are all on the same page. Number 8, you
received every vote. Do you want to seek
revenge on one of them, or do you want to
go out on your own? I'm not taking anyone with me. You all are lucky.
She spared you. I think that deserves a little round
of applause before we drop you. Chandler, pull the lever! Twelve of you now remain. 
$500,000 on the line. And remember, whoever you vote out could
be taking you with them, so choose wisely. Oh, my gosh. Let's have some fun. Nine. She said nine? Nine? Yeah? She may take me with her. That's why I’m a little nervous. Wield it as a threat. You can tell the person beside you if they
vote for you, you're gonna take 'em down. That’d probably sway them not to . I don’t know... I can't call it. I'm just, like, stressing
a lot right now. Why are you stressing?
What's going on? Why am I stressing? You have eight seconds until two of
you could be eliminated. Who will it be? Time is up. The person who received
the most votes... is... nine. Oh, my gosh. What's going to influence your
decision you're about to make? I'm pretty sure the person
knows what I'm thinking. In the cubes, you picked up on
who was trying to get you out? Yeah, from the get-go. I'm definitely gonna say nine. My mom would not be proud of this. Sometimes, as they say,
revenge is a dish best served cold. Number 3. I don't have anything to say. Gentlemen, stand in the middle
of your platforms. Drop them! And when the dust settled
after those eliminations, two leaders stood
out among the group. 19 was the most
vocal in the cubes, and 14 took charge during the
votes... Right here. but it's still anyone's game. And with $500,000 on the
line, anything can happen. Are you ready for
the next phase? Who is that? Behind this door, the guards have
a little something for each of you. Go ahead and open your box. Some of you might recognize
this game from Beast Games. The blocks? No! - Did you guys play blocks?
- Yes! And we all got out! These blocks, I swear to God. Just like in episode one, players will stack their blocks on top
of the red starting block to build a tower. But if your tower falls, 
you will be eliminated. And since you only
have one minute to stack, you won't be required
to use every block. In fact, you don't even
have to stack blocks at all. But if a tower does not fall
by the end of one minute, then the person with the
most blocks in their tower will get the power, the decision, the
burden, of choosing who will be eliminated. All right, everyone, 
put your hands up. I want to make sure
everyone has a clean start. Start the timer! Those who lost this
challenge in Beast Games... I hate my life! ...were careful not to be too
ambitious in building their tower, relying on the strength of their
alliances to carry them through. She's not even gonna try. But without an alliance and all of
her neighbors already eliminated, number one's best shot at
staying safe is in her own hands. Look how many blocks she has. Five seconds remain! Three. Two. One. Hands up! - No...
- Oh, my gosh. Oh, honey. There will be no vote.
A tower has fallen. I assume you were feeling
threatened that if you didn't win, they would vote you out? Yes, I did. I got myself out of the equation
since everybody was already plotting. Stephanie, I was tryna save you. That’s cap. We talked. Wait, 20, you're you
saying she's lying? I mean, we both agreed,
a lot of us agreed that one was going to
be the next voted out. 11 clearly wasn't
on the same page We were talkin' on the phone.
Maybe I got prank called. ""Maybe I got prank called."" The stories aren't
adding up across the rows. I guess good luck, because now
you'll have to turn against each other. I don't know if you're
all aware of this, but number one is
actually pregnant. Yeah! Drop her! I'm kidding. Did your heart drop? Yes. Given the circumstances, we
let her leave out the front door. Bye! But as for everyone else, it was time for round two. Start the timer! She is definitely in the lead. The question is:
like the first round, will someone's tower fall? Do you feel good about this? Don’t talk to me, Karl. Is the strategy of not doing
anything gonna work out? Less than 10 seconds. Place your final blocks now! Three. Two. One. Hands up! This time no one's tower fell, which means we need to see
who has the most blocks stacked. One. Two. Three. Four. Six. Seven. Eight. 
I have eight. At eight blocks, 19
stacked the most blocks. But so did 14. Are you guys in
the same alliance? No. And so two players
from opposing forces must agree on who to eliminate. I think we have to take out a
strong competitor, unfortunately. Yeah. How about this: I'm willing to say mine out loud if
you are, and then we can go from there. Yeah, I'm not
sayin' it out loud. Even a whisper between 14 and 19 could
be heard by everyone else in the room, and discussing
their options out loud may put a target on
their back in future rounds. Communication had to
be discreet and elegant. Such as a subtle guiding
look from the eyes. That's what you want? Yeah, Okay. For sure. Okay. Whenever you're ready, point at an individual that we’ll
rip a half million dollars away from. He still has to point, though. Before you point, boss man, 
I promise you, before this challenge started, bro. If we had to eliminate someone,
she was gonna eliminate you. Believe that if you want. Hey. We can...
hey, you, bro. We can unite... I'm sorry, dude. Oh, my gosh. It's freakin' crazy right now. Do you think your strategy’s
going to stay the same? You’re going to try to build... Yeah, and I'm going
higher this time. Winning will help me survive, and building the tallest tower...
that's maybe the right move. Are you ready for
the final block game? Yes. Yeah! Yeah we are! We've had one tower fall 
and one vote to eliminate. What will you do now
to stay in the game? Start the timer! And while they
stack those blocks, I'm gonna tell you guys how
you can win a brand-new iPhone Over the next few days, I'm going
to be shipping all these iPhones to random people that subscribe. One of these players is literally
walking away with $500,000, and if you want to walk away with a brand
new iPhone, just hit the subscribe button. I know it sounds too good to
be true, but it really is that simple. Subscribe so you can win one of these
iPhones... and their time is almost up. Three. Two. One. Hands up! Hands up! Looks like 19 might have won again. 
Let's see. One, two, three... four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten. She beat her old record. 
Let's see what 15 has. Five. Six. Seven. Eight.
Nine, You have nine? Nine. Let's see about
our boy over here. Five. Six. Seven. Eight.
Nine. Ten... oh, my gosh. So somehow, once again, 14 and
19 played the exact same blocks, which means that
for a second time, they'll have to team up and
choose one player to eliminate. And once again... You're thinking this, right? ...their communication
had to be strategic. Only this time, the message
was intercepted by another player who had an alliance
with their target. Sifu, you're voting for me? It's nothing personal. If it's nothing personal, look at everyone's strategy
of how they're building. 15’s trying to win, right? What do you think
happens next round when he has the same type of
mentality and might go after you? I would never go for you. Who would you
take out if you won? Neither of you.
I’d take out four. Four’s been calling
the shots all game. I don't think he's, like, 
the head over there. Kind of like over here, we're all working
together too, so we could shift to 13. Maybe the one who
never played should pick. 13's firing back. Never played? 
I played. So much drama. I can't
even keep up with it. Don't take out the weakest. 14, I need you to
point at someone. Whatever you do, 
I'm good with it. I'm sorry, dude. Four. Sifu... It's now in 19’s hands. 19, what did you think
about that other strategy? She did not care. That was cold-blooded. Love you, Caden. I must say, this experiment has
been very entertaining. But there are still seven of you
and only one giant pile of money. Are you ready for the next game? Direct your attention
to the screens. Okay. This next challenge is one of the
most-watched challenges of Beast Games. It's almost a million dollars that I will wire to you if
you press that button. And since all of you enjoyed it, 
we decided to run it back. That money counter is going to
go up exponentially faster over time. The first one of you to press
the button on your platform will instantly win whatever
dollar amount is on that screen, but you will be
eliminated in the process. That's right. What's the twist?
What's the twist? No, don't ask that. If the timer hits zero and
none of you press the button, then you all move on. What? Nobody has to be
eliminated on this game. Oh, my gosh. Okay. Okay. If somebody wants the
money, they can take the money. Only one of you is gonna
win the money in the middle. Should you take the
guaranteed money now, or do you wanna roll the dice at
winning the half a million dollars? The choice is up to you. You all have some
decisions to make. It's definitely hard. You have a kid that
just came into your life. If that hits 100 K,
would you press the button? I probably would. Really? I would, dude. Okay. I doubt I'll press this button. Are you gonna press? No. Pam, are you pressing? I don't intend to at all. Dang. I don't know if
anybody's gonna press. It depends on the
number, I mean- right? If it's at 500 K, you wouldn’t 
press the button? I’d press, yeah. Yeah. Okay. All right. So you had a number, 400 K. No. You wouldn't press
the button for 400 K? Yeah, I mean, I
probably would, but... Are you guys ready
to start the game? Oh, by the way, if you press the button, the money
you win will come out of the prize pool. No! Start the money counter! No! That's crazy. Oh, my gosh. It's so fast. That money could go
in your bank account. Are you serious? Yo, I'm not pressin'. If you press the button,
you will win $18,000. $21,000 I'm not pressin'. $25,000! It's going to get to a hundred. Guys! Somebody press it. 30 grand! And it's going
up so fast, I can't say it! Dude, that's a down
payment on a house! Oh 13’s startin' to hover! I'm gonna do it. You are? Don't do it. It’s a lot of money. Oh, it looks like 11’s hovering. Don't do it. $50,000 if you
press that button! Are you thinking about it? I'm thinkin'! Do it. Do it. Do it. No... 65 Pam. Do it. Do it. Oh! She took it! Oh my god! At $69,000! I'm sorry to take that
from you guys. I'm sorry– Stop it! Stop it! You're good. We're so happy for
you, I swear to God. - I’m sorry. 
- It's okay. Just buy me something, girl. I saw your hand was hovering. Your hand was hovering. It was a deadlock race. What dollar amount
would you have pressed it? I didn't intend to. Oh, you were just
doing a fake-a-rooney? She was making me stressed. 
I was like, ""dang, she told me she's
gonna press it,"" I'm like- - I gotta press it before she does. 
- Well, congrats! I can’t believe it. And now the prize pool is 431
grand. You can head on out. Thank you. Good luck winning! You got this! See ya. Good luck. There's only six of you left. How's everyone feelin’? Nervous! Excited! Feeling good. Excited. I definitely came here for the
experience and for a little redemption from Beast Games, and I feel like I got that already. So thank you guys all for
being here with me, and... 
love you all. I've never told anyone this,
but I almost died two years ago. It's been a long journey
getting back on my feet, but Nonni wants to visit her
grandchildren a little more... ...and love ‘em a little
more, and this will help. My goal in life is to make a
positive impact, to make a difference. And so winning this money
would empower me to do so. I'd want to help people
in need... that's the goal. I want my son to
look up and say, “That guy tried every single
time to make a difference.” I got a second chance at life
when I beat Stage 3 Cancer. I really want to start a mobile bus
salon service for people who has cancer. ‘Cuz sometimes you just
don't wanna get out the bed, so you pullin' up, putting a
smile on somebody else’s face, like- that is, like, super
dope. That's why I'm here. We have an amazing final six players.
Honestly, all of you deserve to win. For this next game, two of you will be randomly eliminated. Randomly? Unless... Switch their buttons red. One of you presses that red
button, self-eliminating yourself, and in exchange, I will let you
pick one of the other five contestants, and they can skip every
single game until the final game, basically giving them a
coin flip shot at $431,000. Lotta power. - That's crazy.
- That is so stressful. It's wild. You'll have 60
seconds to decide. Are your alliances strong enough
to help one of you get to the end, or are you guys gonna leave it up to
chance and just two of you get dropped? You all had a chance to win 69
grand, and none of you took it. Let's see if you end
up regretting that. Start the timer! If you guys are good enough friends where you'll take a bullet
to send them to the finals. If you send me to the
finals, I will take care of you. I don’t need you to do
that. Thank you, though. Anyone? I- I don’t know. We don’t wanna
leave it up to chance. Who do you think
deserves the money? - Think about it, bro.
- This is your chance. You gonna do it? 20 seconds left. You can be a hero in front of - hundreds of millions of people,
- 15... I will take care of
you, I promise you Three. Two. One. Time's up. He was reaching for it. Were you actually
gonna press it? He thought about it. Yeah. There's– I might’ve. If you did press it, who would
you have pushed through? I honestly think I should've. None of you were willing
to sacrifice yourselves. All right... we gotta
drop two people. Start the randomizer! Say a prayer
while you still can. Dear Jesus. 431 grand on the line. That's crazy. You guys had a chance
to take it in your own hands, Sophia. and now it's gonna
be left up to fate. Dang. Aw... I'm sorry. Jake. All right, guys. I'm sorry, bro. Sifu, I really, I wish I pressed
it for you, and I'm sorry. Sifu’s the guy. He's
worked so hard. I hope he does win. - Right on, hey?
- Respect brother. You’re the man. It sucks to go, but, you
know, you're all amazing. I wish you all the best of luck. Peace. Five of you remain. Start the randomizer! And if
you survive this next randomizer, you'll have a 25% chance
at winning 431 grand. Oh, this has to be
nerve-wracking for you guys. Who was that? Who was that? Number 7. Damn, I'm so sorry. It's all right. We love you. And you've been so amazing. You're wonderful and beautiful. Good luck, everyone.
I love you all. Drop her. Oh, my God. Now we're at the
top four. Congrats! Let's go! That sucked. I liked them. I feel like we all
deserve to be here. Yes. We all bonded in
our own lil' ways. - I agree with you.
- Yeah. It looks like the four of
you are getting along nicely, which is great, because for this next
game, I need you to pair up with someone. I won’t tell you why you're pairing
up. I just need you to choose. On the count of three,
point at your partner. One. Two. Three. Bring em on in. Oh my gosh. Not this again. Holy cow. Welcome back to the cubes. Who knows what he
got planned in here. I have no idea. All right, these two
will enter this cube. And these two
will enter that cube. The thing is, only one
of them will come out, and only one of
them will come out. Guards! Let ‘em in!
$431,000 on the line. Good luck. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh, honey. Girl, this is not gonna be fun. If you've seen episode three of Beast
Games, you'll know how this game works. There is a pair of handcuffs
on the wall of both these cubes, and whoever handcuffs
themselves to that wall will be eliminated. It's up to each cube to decide who
handcuffs themselves and who moves on. - I don't know about this.
- Jeez. You have a phone, and you can
request any item in the world you want. Anything that help
the two of you decide. What? He said any item in
the world you want. You guys can play
whatever game you want. You don't even have to play a
game. You can ask for anything. Got any request ideas? All that matters is whoever handcuffs
themselves to their cell will be eliminated, and the other will move on and
have a 50/50 chance at $431,000. I have to bring that
money home to my child. This is, I think, the
toughest one we’ve done. Yeah. This is tough. I don't care about
winning no game. I care more about coming
home with what I need. I know. It's important for
me to give back ‘cuz I know how I felt when I
was going through chemo and I lost all my hair
and brows and stuff, so I really want to
be able to give back. I understand that. This is crazy. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Come here. Come here. Just come here. These two have a clear
understanding of what's at stake. But over in the other cube, they were struggling to
understand each other at all. Are you super fit? We
could do a plank-off. We could hold a plank
until somebody falls over. Oh, yeah, I can do that. No, do you
know what a plank is? Yeah. Yeah.
A piece of wood. Yeah. But, like, it's a,
it's an exercise. Never done that. It's like this. Never done that. Meanwhile, the other cube had a strategy
that, honestly, I didn't see coming. Oh, you’re just
gonna ask for money? Let's see. That's a smart idea. Five hundred thousand dollars. We can bring it, but you won't
be able to take it out of the cube. They can’t get it. Let's see. I’m gonna say
four hundred thousand. Three hundred thousand dollars. Two hundred thousand dollars. A check for $500,000. Immunity. All right, we've got
to figure this out. Are you willing to do
Rochambeau? Rock, paper, scissors? I don’t play games. Can I request to
switch teammates? Knock, knock. Who's there? You have a massive
decision coming up... Okay. ...and I'd hate for you to
do it on an empty stomach. So we brought you some
Lunchly and Feastables. The peanut butter is
my absolute favorite! Thank you! Oh my gosh, I love the candy. I’d never tried a Lunchly,
so I'm excited about this. Today's the best
day of your life. Cheers! If you wanna do
something physical, we can- I mean, you can literally lay
on your back and hold weights until you can't
hold them anymore. We could do that. I mean, I'm old,
but I can still do it. You wanna just
hold weights like this? Yeah. See who- who breaks first? Wait, you're thinking of
just holding up weights? Yep. You think you can
out-hold... weights? I think she's fit. I do weights. Oh, okay. When you figure it out,
ask for it on the phone. Could we have two sets of
5 pound weights? Thank you. All right. One delivery
of some weights. Three. Two. One. Begin. $431,000 on the line for who
can hold the weight the longest. I'm gonna go check
in on the other cube. So now it's time for
rock, paper, scissors. So we're going rock,
paper, scissors, shoot. Do you want to say
anything to throw her off? Do you want to say
what you might throw so she thinks
you're gonna throw it, so then you throw something
else to counter what she thinks? No. Okay. Let's go. Rock,
paper, scissors. Shoot. Rock, paper, scissors. Shoot. Can you bring us bigger
weights? We need to go faster. So here's what I'm gonna to do. Three. Two. One. Down. Three. Two. One. Grab. Three. Two. One. Lift. $431,000 on the line. And we just doubled the weight. Okay! That’s got me, girl.
I can't do it, baby. Pam, pick it up! - I'm trying, honey. I'm trying.
- Pam, come on. Pam, come on! - I'm going. You got it.
- Oh, my gosh! You got it, sweetie. Rock, paper, scissors, shoot. Rock, paper, scissors, shoot. Rock, paper, scissors, shoot. All right. He has officially
been eliminated. Are you ready... - I'm ready.
- to see your opponent? I'm ready. The other cube is already over. Okay. The person you are facing is
standing on the other side of this door. The final challenge will be
number 11 versus number 19. I just got excited, y'all. One of you is about
to win a lot of money. Follow me back to the platforms. Welcome to the final game. In between you two is the
$431,000 you are competing for. Remind us one more time if you won,
what would you spend this money on? I would spend the money
on a mobile bus salon, ‘cuz I want to be able to
give back to cancer patients. So you want kind of like a salon on
wheels that you can go to hospitals and help out cancer patients? Yeah, and just
travel the world with it. That's pretty cool. Number 11. Well... I don't have a...
great story like that, um. I’d probably try to put the money
towards starting my own winery business. You both have battled
and survived everything I have thrown at you
in this experiment, yet you're both standing
here. For this final experiment, their destiny will
literally be in their hands. What I need both of you to do is take
a hand and push down on the button. Push and hold. If you look behind me,
you'll see the $431,000 is also on a trap door
like the two of you. And when this one minute timer begins, if one of you lifts your
hand off the button, the other person
will win the $431,000. But... if when that timer hits
zero, neither of you lift your hand, then the money will fall and
neither of you will win anything. This is actually
up to the two of you if one of you wins
431 grand, or... if you can't agree, and the
money falls into an endless abyss. This will be the most important
sixty seconds of your lives. Either one of you backs down, or
both of you will go home with nothing. This whole video’s been
wrapped around a minute, and this is your last minute
to try and win this money. Start the timer! Let's see if you're both
going home with nothin'. I'll definitely invest in your
business. You got my word. You're saying if
she lifts her hand... Yeah. ...you'll put some
money in her business? Absolutely. Okay. Like, how much money
are we talkin'? There's 400 grand... However much she
say. We can split it. I don't have a problem with it. Are we allowed to do this? I mean, she can be lying. I just want my mobile bus
salon. That's all I really want. Then you should tell her to lift
her hand, and you'll wire her money. Only one of you is going to
walk away with this money. Um... Let me invest in your business. 30 seconds! Oh, my gosh. If no one lifts their
hand, that money is falling I feel like I’ve been honest
with you from day one. I feel like you're gonna... I'm not, I mean,
have I been honest? Look, I’ve trusted
you this whole time, and I think you’re... Someone might walk away with nothing.
They might walk away with nothing. I got you. - I got you.
- Thirteen seconds! I promise. And you're a
cancer survivor, so. I got you. I swear to God. 
I got you. Oh, my gosh! We have a winner. 19! I got you girl, I swear I got you. Wait, 11, what you just did might
have been the most selfless thing we've ever
had in any of our videos. We've had thousands
of people compete. No one's ever done
something like that. The viewers are gonna
want to know. Why? I won all the other games, and I feel like giving away the
money here was winning this one. 19’s a cancer survivor, and she's
gonna give back to cancer patients. I really wanted her
to have the money. Oh, my gosh. 19 you've gotta honor that. I am. - She just gave up everything
- I got her. - so you could help cancer survivors. 
- I got her. I got her. Oh, my gosh. From day one. All right. Drop her. 19, go get your money! If you enjoyed this video, then you have to see my record-breaking

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SM66GDRyIVY,"I Helped 2,000 People Walk Again",930,20250111,en,"In this video, we're gonna to
help 2000 people walk again! The video you are about to watch
is unlike anything we've ever done. Walking is something most of
us take for granted every day, but for millions of
amputees all around the world,  they don't
have that same luxury. But in this video, for 2000
people, that is about to change. I had an accident back in 2020 and I shattered
both of my ankles. When he first got sick, they didn’t think he
would live another year. I was in a car wreck
when I was 17. That's how I lost my feet. And to kick things off,
we're going to help Stephanie. Hi! How's it going? Good. We're so excited you're here. I'm so nervous. How long has it been since you've
been able to walk on your own? I have not walked on
my own since 2009. Almost 15 years since you've
been able to walk on your own. Yeah. Well, we might have
something that could change that. This is your brand new leg.
Here you go. Thank you. - What do you think of it?
- Oh my Gosh! I love her. You ready to try it on? I am. Okay, let's slide it on in. Okay. What do you think? Feels wonderful. All right. You ready to stand up? For the first time in 15 years, Stephanie is actually walking. It fits wonderful. That's my dad. Does it warm your heart to be
able to see her move around again? Yes. Very much so. I'm just glad that she's going to be
able to get to do something she wants to. Not be a prisoner anymore. You guys can look each
other in the eyes now. We can dance. And that's exactly what they did. It felt so good to be able to
help Stephanie and her family. So we did the same thing for Colleen. It's been seven months
since you were able to walk. - I'm ready.
- Let's do it. It's amazing to have another chance. And we helped David,
Adrian, Linda and Kharid. But to be honest, we could not have pulled this off without
the help of some incredible people. We've replaced limbs
that people have lost. What’s the typical cost for someone
to get like a prosthesis like this? Anywhere from 5 to 50,000. And it sounds crazy, but most of the people in this
video either cannot afford insurance or did not have adequate coverage, meaning if we didn't step in, they
might not have ever walked again. And if insurance doesn't cover that,
what do you do? You hope and fundraise and pray
that someone like you comes along. This would take me about ten years. Wait, to buy this on your own
would have taken ten years? Yes. That's...
Chandler! Obviously that's not okay. So we're gonna to send
you home with $10,000. This is a day in my
life I would never forget. No problem. You came in with one leg, and now you're leaving with
two and a briefcase full of money. Best day of my life. Oh, man, it feels awesome. It feels so real.
Like it's part of me. You can walk again, and you
don't have the financial burden. This is life changing. Here I am now.
I’m very thankful. As we learned through this process, when you lose
your ability to walk, you also lose the ability to
do life's most basic tasks, something that Greg knows all too well. Everything’s twice as
hard as it used to be. I played tennis all the
time with the family, but I'd be happy just being able
to stand up and do the dishes. Okay, let's see how your new leg fits. All right, he's getting right into it. It's a good feeling, stand up. All right. How's it feel? I tell you what.
It makes you smile. When you're an amputee, everyday activities can feel
like insurmountable tasks. But for Travis, there's a
special occasion coming up that he just can't do sitting down. My daughter's been planning her
wedding since she was 3 or 4 years old. I've always dreamed of having my
dad walk me down the aisle. Do you mind telling us
a little bit about yourself? Yeah, I used to run six,
seven days a week if I was bored. And I was in a car
wreck when I was 17, had osteomyelitis, and
that's how I lost my feet. How long has it been since
you're able to walk normally? I don't know what normal is anymore. Are you guys excited
to see him walk again? - Yes.
- Yeah. Super excited. Here's your right leg. Here you go. And here's the left leg. This is awesome. You got this! First step. Do you wanna go for it? He's walking better than
some of the people with one leg. You’re making this look easy. I'mma surely start running. What's it like to see him walking? It’s awesome. I'm excited. No hands. No hands. Now you can walk her down the aisle. Yeah. Down the aisle, have
the father-daughter dance. I know this wedding is
important to all of you, which is why I asked your soon to be
husband how much the wedding would cost. And on this wheelchair
is the exact amount. We're gonna cover the
entire cost of your wedding. And now your dad can
join you down the aisle. Thank you. Thank you for not telling her. I really appreciate it.
Thank you so much. The real question though is...
are we invited? - Yeah.
- Gotta bring some Feastables. Deal. And he wasn't kidding. Later in this video, we actually do
go to Travis's daughter's wedding. And while we're paying for
all the prosthetics in this video, that won't always be the case. And while 5 to $50,000 is already
too expensive for most people, that price tag is felt even
heavier in developing countries, which is what brought me
to Guatemala to meet David, who founded the Range of Motion Project to address the lack of
prosthetics for the underprivileged. One of the ways that prosthetic care gets
delivered to the poor is poor technology. So what makes it so expensive? Very expensive pieces of technology. And David found it a simple
way to maintain quality at only one tenth the cost. Everything that you see here
is part of our global inventory of recycled components. So everything in this room is
recycled from some other prosthetic? A lot of it is still functional. So if you have a prosthetic
that you want to donate so he can use it to help more people, just go to this website right here. That's how he's able
to make it so cheap so he can help the poorest of
the poor all around the world. And for us, that means we
can help even more people get back to their full
lives here in Guatemala. From everything as
adventurous as riding motorcycles, You're making this look easy. playing soccer, Down to the smallest
pleasures of life. You guys are adorable. [Spanish] The first thing I
want to do is walk with my family. [Spanish] It's like you returned my life. You're taller than your mom. Like hugging your family. How's it going, everybody? Let's take our first step together. We're watching a child
reclaim their independence. At any stage of life, a new
limb can mean everything. And by the end of the day, we
have helped so many people. But our mission was
just getting started. You were saying some people
can't even make it to the facility. It's just a mountainous,
tough country to travel in, rivers that people have to cross,
jungles that people have to get through. Not being able to walk is really kind
of trapping patients in their homes. Which is why David
sometimes has to leave the clinic and visit the patients
in their own home, which comes with its own difficulties. Where's your truck at? I thought we were taking you guys' cars. - No, I...
- We don't have a truck. You don't have a truck to go reach
these people in remote places? No. With the bulk of ROMP’s
resources going into staff, and the prosthetics themselves, they can't afford reliable transportation to get to hard to reach patients. That is, until now. I could have sworn that was your truck. If it's not, why does it
say ROMP on the side? We worked with the staff,
none of them told him. This brand new $65,000
truck is fully equipped to traverse even the
most difficult terrain. Thank you guys. Congrats man. Let's go break it in by
giving away some legs. All right. And the further away we got from
the bustling streets of Guatemala City, I realized David wasn't kidding when
he said these places were hard to get to. As we headed to a home, located on the side of a literal
volcano in the middle of the jungle. I now understand why
this truck was so valuable. Oh my... Yeah, I could not imagine
driving a normal car down this road. We finally made it here and our journey up the volcano
brought us here to meet Kevin [Spanish] Hello. Who was left severely burned and without either of his legs
in an accident 24 years ago. You're living on the side of a volcano. How do you get around?
This is very difficult terrain. [Spanish] It's rather difficult, because… It’s too rough for him, so someone actually does
need to push him in a wheelchair. And that ends today. [Spanish] Thank you. You're about to take your first step. All right, now we're walking
down the side of the volcano. Come on over here, mom. [Spanish] I love you! Bless you! [Spanish] There are a
lot of us that are struggling and I thank god for
allowing our paths to cross That made Kevin the 71st
person we've helped walk again. And David and I took that momentum with us to help even more people
over here in Ecuador. Like Kelly, who spent six
days busing from Bolivia to here. Not even knowing if she
would get a prosthetic. [Spanish] It was very scary
because I’ve never left my country and I still decided to risk it! This is why we're doing
this video right here. All right, It's been two
years since you walked. It's a big moment. You want to take your first step? [Spanish] I am happy! Kelly was so happy to be walking
again that she then asked this [Spanish] Can I dance [Spanish] You want to dance?! [Spanish] Yes - The thing is...
Would you accompany me? - You want me to dance?
- [Spanish] Yes. Oh, boy.
Oh I don't know what I'm doing. You wouldn't even believe this is
her first time walking in two years and she started dancing. What? [Spanish] It feels real! And even though I clearly
don't know how to dance. Watching this family be reunited
with such an important part of their past meant the world to me. [Spanish] Thank you! And as for Eduardo, he had a really touching
reaction to getting his new leg. He kissed it, that was adorable. He hasn't walked in months,
which is obviously a shame because he's only five years old. It's a big moment.
Whenever you’re ready Eduardo. The mom was saying that he
would have to drag himself around and was even embarrassed
of not having a leg, so. To see him moving
like this is wonderful. Here you go. All right you want
to throw it on? What's it like seeing
your daughter walk again? [Spanish] Very emotional! Very exciting! I mean, look at this. She hasn't walked in over a year. This is honestly my favorite video.
This is crazy. [Spanish] Hello.
How's it going? [Spanish] Oh my god! [Spanish] Hi! - [Spanish] How are you?
- [Spanish] I'm fine. Meeting Fede is cool and all
but the real reason we're here is your brand new prosthetic. This is all yours. 100% free. [Spanish] Thank you so much!
I’m so thankful. This is a blessing. [Spanish] How does it feel to walk again? [Spanish] A really huge happiness And to further inspire strength in the
50 amputees we helped here in Ecuador. David shared with us
one of his favorite rituals. We love to take them
hiking on that mountain. And now we're going to climb this mountain
to break in their new prosthetics! If they can climb this mountain,
they can get through daily life. I can see the symbolism of this task. Let the journey begin. All right. This is actually pretty hard. This guy went from not walking
to literally hiking up a mountain. I mean, it's truly amazing. You really like to
challenge these patients. If you can reach a new height, reach new summit with a disability, you might feel that
anything else is possible. And I saw just that. The amount of persistence and
ambition that these amputees showcased was unlike anything
I had seen before. This is what this trip is all
about is refusing to give up. I'll be honest, I didn't fully understand
why we were climbing this mountain, but now I get it. It's to show them that if
they can climb this mountain, they can essentially overcome
anything with their brand new prosthetic. We made it to the top. Good job. If you guys can hike this
mountain, you can do anything. I'm proud of you.
I'm proud of you guys. And our reward now
is this beautiful view. Now we're gonna head
all the way over to Kenya, where we found a bunch of
kids who still have their legs but needed expensive surgeries to be able
to use them, which, of course, we paid for. Look at that. Before the surgery, some of these
kids have never walked their entire lives. And now look at them. When I tried to walk, I could find myself now not
knowing the way I fell down. I was being laughed at
by my fellow students. So sometimes I could not go to school How did that feel,
taking your first steps? I can walk like the other people. So this makes me so happy. And along with providing
these life changing surgeries, we also provided a brand new playroom
at this clinic for the kids to enjoy. Come check out the new playroom! And at this point I'm gonna
pick up the pace a little bit because after Kenya, we went all
over Africa helping people walk again. My family, my financial status and
everything I know is going to change. And from there we went to the
Philippines, Cambodia and Sri Lanka. Thank you so much for helping us.
Thank you. Thank you very much. It's like a second chance for me. I feel alive again. My heart is beating! And after visiting countries
all around the world and witnessing 2,000 1st steps, I'm glad to say we could help
change the lives of so many people all across the world. But as you’ll remember
from earlier in this video, we still have a wedding we need to attend. Which is weirder, the fact we’re at a
wedding of people we met 24 hours ago? - Or Nolan’s shirt?
- Nolan’s shirt, a hundred percent. What is this little rope? All right, Travis is about to
walk his daughter down the aisle. Let’s see if his brand new legs work.
It's a big moment. I've always dreamed of having
my dad walk me down the aisle. I'm about to cry, dude This is awesome. Now I'm happy to give you
all Mr. and Mrs. Anderson Watching Travis walk his
daughter down the aisle made me reflect on
all the people's lives who were impacted throughout this video. I was able to walk
her down the aisle. It was just amazing.
Thank you guys so much. Hey, guys, I want it in this video
a little differently than normal. And I wanted to say that the fact that some of these people
had insurance and were denied, some of these people had insurance
but didn't have the right coverage. It just doesn't
sit right with me. Their only hope right now
of getting a prosthetic leg so they can walk again,
so they can go get a job is for a YouTuber to
step in and help them, which is absurd. I don't know what the answer is, but I wanted to say this so the 100 million people
watching this can get inspired because what I saw when filming
this video is just obviously not okay so. Anyways, thanks for watching."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gs8qfL9PNac,"2,000 People Fight For $5,000,000",1484,20241219,en,"I am sitting on 5 million dollars in cash
and competing for it. Open the gates! Are these two thousand contestants! What you are witnessing is just the start
of something never before seen in history. 2000 people are about to battle
in a series of trials for a spot in my ten episode
Prime Video series called Beast Games. Ladies and gentlemen, look to your left
and look to your right. 1000 of you will be eliminated
by the end of this video. But for the other half
of you moving on to Beast Games, one of you will walk
away with a life-changing, record-shattering grand prize
of 5 million dollars. And our first game is...
Drop the curtains! The first challenge of these trials
is gonna test your strength. - 10 thousand?!
- What?! My arms hurt looking at that. I need all of you to split up
into five groups of 400. Whichever group is the last
to lift that 10,000 pound boulder across that finish line is eliminated. Let's go! Group up! Group up! We got a strategy going.
The strong ones are at the front. This team was made to break backs,
break dreams and crush spirits. I'm going to be so for real,
I don't think I'm cut out for this. 400 of you are about to be eliminated. Home is not an option. Guys, this is for $5 million!
We don't want to be the first out. Three! Two! One! Go! Pull! You got it! Go! We got it. Pull! Holy crap, Jonathan, pull! Run. Run! Run! Run to the front! Pull! Let's go! Last boulder to touch
the top is eliminated. Let's go! Run! Run! Oh! Oh my gosh, that was insanely quick. Let's go green! Three teams reached the finish line. It's down to yellow and red.
Which one of you is going home? - Come on, red!
- Come on, we're losing! One, two, pull! No! We're doing it wrong!
We’re doing it so– Keep going! Run! We have to go backwards. No! That's yellow.
Oh, no. Red just lost out on this chance
to win 5 million dollars. Oh, man. That was my one thing
I told myself I did not want to be
eliminated first round. Red team, I'm sorry you got eliminated, but to make it feel
a little better... We're going to give you
$2,000 for competing. And that goes for all of you. Every single one of you will
receive $2,000 just for showing up. That's right.
It's three minutes into the video, and we've already given away $800,000. And with a total
of 2000 contestants competing, that means we're giving away $4 million
throughout Beast Games just for contestants showing up. So as these trials were heating up
and some people chose to go home early– It really is my time to step out. 24 hours I did it.
I did a day. At least they got to
walk away with $2,000, which might be a big brain move, because these trials are only going
to get more intense. Congratulations on passing
the first challenge. Don't you just love your teams? Yellow team,
don't you love each other? Green! Orange! Pink! Unfortunately for challenge two,
your teammates will be your opponents. Bring out the briefcases. Only pink team, stand around
the red border. Come on over. In front of you is a sea of briefcases. Some say eliminated.
Some say saved.  On the jumbotron,
we are going to quickly show which briefcases are safe
and which are eliminated. Your goal is to memorize where
the safe briefcases are and claim one before someone else does. Think fast and run faster because of the 400 people
on each team 50 of you will be ending up
with an eliminated briefcase. Alright, reveal the map. Okay. The second row. Seven. That's row number seven. I hope all of you have
a briefcase in mind. Three! Two! One! Go! Oh it’s like a sea of people.
Oh, okay. Oh my God. Hopefully, this is what I think it is. And if it's not, then I'm gonna find
someone to blame. - What's in that case?
- I have no clue what's in here. So your chance to win $5 million completely relies on this case
either being safe or eliminated. And you have no clue. Yeah. Best of luck. Now that everyone has a case, it is time to find out
what your fate is. Will that briefcase in front
of you let you move on. Or will it be costing you
this life changing $5 million? Three! Two! One! Reveal! - Congratulations to the
350 of you that see green. But to the 50 of you that see
red, you have been eliminated. I'm sorry, but I need you
to head over to the exit. I thought I was safe. I was not expecting this.
I thought I was going in far. I am safe. I'm actually safe! I did it. I'm safe. This is so amazing. Pink team. You can head back to your lane. Eliminated players, collect your $2,000
and head out. With 50 players already eliminated
from the pink team, we shuffle the briefcases in a new order
and send orange team to the same fate. Alright orange team,
I hope you're all ready for this. Throw up the map! You guys take the
early ones, I'll go far. Okay. I'm really nervous. We're going. One. Two.
Three. Four. Three! Two! One! Go! - Oh my God! I’m shaking.
- Do you trust them? I’m really praying
this is good. Let's see who's going on
to compete for $5 million. Open them up! What’d you get? Yes! Yes! Let’s go! Let's go! With the orange team winners moving on, we, of course, gave
the eliminated players $2,000 each. - Thank you so much.
- Thank you for coming out. - Oh my gosh.
- And send green up to the chopping block. Reveal the map! - I'm going for this one right here.
- I'm gonna go over there. Yellow. You guys nervous back there? Make sure you pay attention.
It's very important. Look at all of them. They're all
studying it as hard as they can. Go! - Yes!
- Yes! Three! Two! One! Reveal! What did you get? While another 50 players
were lost from the green team, I had something extra diabolical
in store for this final round. Yellow team, remember
when I told you to pay attention? Yellow, make sure you pay attention.
It's very important. You guys are going to use
the same pattern green used. But we're only gonna show
the map for a couple seconds. - Man, I can't believe this.
- This is not it. This is so ridiculous. Everybody stand around the edge. That’s it, we’re locking in. Flash the map! I'm going for that one.
I'm going to that first one. Go! Everybody’s strategy
on this one was just to run.  Nobody down there looks confident at all. Alright. Everyone has a briefcase. Let's find out if you're competing
for $5 million... or heading out. Three! Two! One! Open your briefcase. Oh my gosh! Yeah! Let’s go! For those of you that got green, you are all moving on
to the next challenge! - I've got a question!
- What? How does it feel to be winners? And that is the end
of challenge number two. Let's get some rest
before the next challenge. Man, a long day. I finally get to sleep. We're sleeping here by the money.
We're trying to manifest it. We ride together.
We sleep together. We win together. Sleep well, everyone. You're going to need your strength
for this next challenge. I will do whatever it takes
for my family and for my tribe. I don't think there's anything
I wouldn't do to win this money. Congratulations
to all fourteen hundred of you for making it this far. We have two more challenges
in this audition  for my new Prime Video show Beast Games. The rules for challenge three are simple. We are placing flags across
the playing field in front of you. You will need to capture
a flag in order to move on. There's fourteen hundred of you
and eleven hundred flags. This means 300 of you will be eliminated. So we'll be setting out
a different number of flags each round until all
eleven hundred have been captured. But once you cross the red line,
you have to capture a flag or you’re eliminated. You get a flag or you go home.
No $5 million. Run as fast as I can. Get to a flag.
Snatch it as quick as possible. There's only ten flags
on the field for this first round, and there's a lot more
than ten of you. So if you're not
fully committed to go now, - it's your last chance to step back and wait for a better
chance in the later round. I will not go on the first round.
Not go on the second round. Smart. Not go on the third round. Alright, we're about to start round one. What if you both go for the same flag? He better be faster. As soon as I blow this horn,
the round will begin. - Oh!
- Oh, look! Oh! They're running!
Oh! He's going. He's going! Barely anybody went. Oh look those two are racing for flag one. We got a collision. Yeah! Let's go, number ten.
Let's go, number ten, baby! Ten flags were captured
and two people are eliminated. Thank you for coming out. And for the ten of you
who captured a flag, Congratulations!  You secured a spot
in our next challenge. Only 12 people went for this. Yeah, people are way
smarter than I thought I thought hundreds
of people were gonna go. We started off a little tame. Now let's get crazy. For the second round,
we're gonna bring out 50 flags. A lot of people are about
to be eliminated. - You're all going this time?
- Yes. - You’re calling out your flag?
- Yes. I got 47. Do not go to 49.
We got 24. I've been calling 24. They're all picking flags.
They're all trying to be strategic. But, if one person is not on the same
page, you all lose 5 million dollars. Alright. Round two.
50 flags on the field. - Oh! No!
- There it goes! Oh, he went for it. Oh my God!
So many people are getting flags. This is insane. There's only a few flags left.
Who is gonna to get the last one? - Oh my god!
- Yeah! - Have you seen number 20 right there?
- Yes, sir. Let's go. All 50 flags have been captured  and five people
have been eliminated. Remember, the longer you wait,
the worse your odds could get. Let's do this. And they're off.  Oh, boy. Oh! Oh ho oh. It seems that most people who cross
the red line end up getting a flag. And not many people
are actually getting eliminated. I think that's eight eliminates
on that one. I see you all in the back. So you're
thinking if you wait until the end, your odds will be way better. But it's not playing out that way. And with the people on the
front lines calling dibs on their flag. Three-oh-seven.
I have three-oh-seven. Two-seventy-four. Two-eighty-four. - He’s got it.
- I don’t know, I’m going for whatever. The number of flags left is dropping fast. This means the chances of getting
a flag are getting worse and worse. This is insane. - Oh my gosh.
- Oh, no! Who's gonna get the last flag? Oh, no! Oh my God! One of the reasons
people were waiting it out was because they were working together. Their group wants me to put it right here. Okay. Taking turns letting
each other take the flag. - Yeah!
- Oh! It doesn't make sense.
Like, why are people being so nice? It's 5 million dollars. Eventually, you’re gonna have to betray
each other. Someone has to go home. Someone has to go home. And as the rounds go on
and the number of flags left drop, the intensity rises. Oh, oh! They’re both going. But you tripped on yourself. Yeah, I know. - Are you okay?
- Yeah. I mean, this is gotta be
the most insane challenge we've ever done. Oh my God, that's crazy. Yeah! Oh my gosh. Ahh! Let's go! Here's what the line looked like
at the start of the challenge. And look at it now. There's 179 of you left
and only 100 flags. Let's dwindle the numbers a little more.
Bring out 50 flags. This is where the strategy comes out. We only have two rounds left. So you can either go right now or take your chances
in our final round. The question is,
if you wait another round, will your odds get better
or will they get worse? Let's have some fun. And they’re off.
They're going! Get a flag. There are only a few flags left. There it is.
She got it! Yeah! There are 115 people still on the line. This will be the final round. Bring out the 50 remaining flags. There's 115 people left. Only 50 people are going
to make it to this side of the ring. With their spot
at Beast Games on the line, everyone was primed
and ready for our final round. Lock in, lock in. Everyone's locked in.
They're gonna go for it. And in this crucial point
in the competition, I made the worst mistake
I possibly could have.  I handed the mic to my friend Karl. Yo! Let’s hype ‘em up!
What’d I do? Everyone thought you said go, Karl. I said yo. Bro, that was like 50 people
just got out. I said yo! Throughout this whole challenge,
it's been very clear that blowing the horn starts each round.
Not Karl yelling yo! - Wow.
- Thanks Jimmy. I wasn't the one with the microphone.
Holy crap. - Wow. That's brutal.
- Dude, all Karl said was yo. Your 'yo' eliminated 31 people. It's always the air horn.
Why would they leave on yo? You know what cheers up sad people
that just lost a challenge? 2000 dollars. I teamed up with MoneyLion, the easiest
place to borrow, earn, and win money to give the 1000 losing contestants
$2,000 each. But MoneyLion is also giving you
at home a chance to win a lot of money. They're giving away another $1,000
to 1000 lucky winners, totaling in one million dollars. To enter, just scan this QR code or visit moneylion.com/beast games. And finally flag... 1100. After this round,
the challenge is over. The final round
of this challenge... $5 million on the line. Three! Two! One! Oh my gosh! Run! Oh my god! The last flag has been captured. Congratulations to the 1100 of you who are moving on to our final challenge, The most cutthroat challenge yet. It's our final night at Allegiant Stadium, home of the Las Vegas Raiders. And we're ready for the final trial
before Beast Games. Outside of, like, doing crazy things,
this is a piece of history that I'll always be able
to look back on. That I’ll always be able
to reflect on and say, dude, I am on a MrBeast video. Alright, the 1000 of you that pass this final challenge will move on to compete
in our ten episode Prime Video series. Every single episode
in that show is bigger than
the biggest YouTube video I have ever done. The scale of this show is unbelievable. We built an entire city. We're giving away
a private island and we’ve got the biggest prizes
in entertainment history. But standing between you
and my Beast Games TV show is one final challenge. I need all of you to split up
into groups of 100. This challenge has nothing
to do with strength or speed. It is all about trust. Who you pick could cost you
your spot in Beast Games, and your shot at $5 million. By the end of this challenge,
one of you will betray your entire team. I’m looking for trust but it's hard
to trust when you don't know people. Don’t let people join this line!
And don't leave it. We want more teammates.
I don't even know who he is. I've never talked to this guy. They’re not trusting the rest of
the group and they're coming our group and then they’re not trusting our group.
I don't trust those people. It’s kind of depressing that
my last survival in this competition is based on these people. Who was the last person to join? One of the guys is basically saying, Hey, 10K, I'm an easy buyout. We can't trust him. Can’t trust everybody, but I trust myself.
That's all that matters. I am very confident in
this group we have here. I don't think anybody's gonna fold. We're gonna make it
to that show no matter what. Going to be with people
that are going to Amazon. There's nothing that can make
me turn my back on my team. It’s time for challenge number four. They’re not going
to be cheering much longer. Starting now,
if you step off your platform... you will be eliminated
and so will your entire platform. Everyone knows the rules. Good luck. I will not leave this platform
for anything. All we have to do is outlast those groups. You better not leave.
I’ll get so mad if you leave. - What’re you gonna do about it?
- It's been about a minute and you haven't been eliminated.
That's good. Yeah! Who's the weak link here? Nobody! How’s this corner doin? We don’t want money, Jimmy!
We don’t want money! I didn’t offer money. - Vibes no bribes!
- All right! I believe that we will win! I love how they all have their own chants. Team no deal! I haven't even offered anything.
But I probably will. We will not be bought. Does anybody want to get out? Okay, I guess I'll go get
a bunch of money.  I'll be right back. Honestly, I don't normally
get nervous before filming, but this one is freaking me out. One person is about
to receive a lot of money, and 99 other people
are gonna be very sad. This is gonna be heart wrenching. I brought three separate bribes out here. I'm not offering this right now. To be clear, none of them are in play.
I just want to show you what they are. My first bribe, which is not in effect reveal what the first bribe will be. It will be $5,000. And, no– That ain't no Tesla, bro. If that doesn't work... I'll give you 50 grand! And if somehow, all 1100 of you decline the 5 grand and the 50 grand... Reveal the third offer! Oh my God. $1 million dollars. It's literally one fifth
of the prize money. When that timer starts, the $5,000 bribe will be in play. If anyone wants
to exchange 99 players for five grand, it's right here. Start the timer! I think we got this. I'm just hoping that someone else
on a different team is willing to leave. - Five thousand dollars!
- No! Five grand? I'm trying to give someone five grand. - No!
- No! Nobody wants $5,000. $5,000 is nothing. 5,000 bucks up for grabs. - 5,000? Wait, right now?
- We don’t want it. We don’t want it! Every single team
has declined the five grand. Seems like no one has any interest. You can go ahead and reset the timer.
Put it back to ten minutes. They don't want it. This offer is off the table. For this group of 1100 people, The price of betrayal
was clearly higher than $5,000, but as we got ready
for the next bribe of 50,000, the entire stadium started to change. People on every single platform
were inching closer to the edge, getting ready... to jump. Because everyone here is competing
with one thing on their mind. This amount of money is life changing. To my seven month old baby, Layla,
I love you and I'm doing this for you. If you win $5 million,
what are you spending it on? Finishing my college degree. I’d start an animal rescue. I’d buy my dad a house
because he's a disabled veteran. I'm gonna buy a house
because my house burned down. I quit my job
to be here. Did anyone else quit their job? Wait, why would you do that? They may have said no to $5,000 but $50,000 is a different story. Now, things are gonna
get very interesting. When that timer starts,
whoever touches the ground first. will now receive $50,000. But I did not expect
for this offer to be so irresistible that someone would actually jump
before the timer even started. What!? What? No. It hasn’t started yet. Oh my God. The timer didn't start! She still stepped off. She's not– she's not gonna get it because that timer hadn’t started.
But she stepped off. Oh no... I didn't start the timer yet. - Oh my gosh.
- I don’t get the money? No. Because the timer hadn't started yet. Oh my God. 99 people
just lost out on $5 million. All because she jumped. I'm sorry, but she stepped off. At least wait for the million! Her team was in disbelief
that they had just been betrayed. And they were absolutely devastated that they wouldn't be moving on
to Beast Games. Alright, platform six. You got– - She doesn’t get the money and we lost?
- No. You guys are eliminated. I'm sorry. She stepped off. You guys have
to head to the exit, I'm sorry. That final game was brutal, but it's nothing compared
to what these 1000 remaining contestants are about to face. They've earned their spot in the
biggest competition series of all time! One of them will walk away
with $5 million, but before they do, they will have
to compete in Beast Games! And that concludes this YouTube video, but check this out. Turn on the lights. This is going to be the most insane show you have ever seen in your life. We built an entire city
from the ground up. We're giving away a private island. We have a five million dollar grand prize and we have 1000 players. I finally have the opportunity
to develop characters, tell longer stories, <b>and go beyond YouTube
with a streaming series</b> unlike anything you've ever seen before. If you've ever enjoyed my content, if I can ask you for anything, ever, it would be to watch Beast Games episode

of those thousand people wins this $5 million in cash. I’m gonna start the show. Head over to Prime Video
and watch Beast Games. I am standing on 5 million dollars
of real money. The largest grand prize
in entertainment history."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BjlBnfHcHM,"Beat Ronaldo, Win $1,000,000",1365,20241130,en,"If this subscriber can
beat Ronaldo in a 1V1, I'm going to give him a million dollars. In this video, you are
going to see the greatest... Oh my gosh! The strongest and the fastest athletes
on the entire planet compete against normal people. Starting with Tom Brady. Ready to meet your opponent? Let's go. Right over here, high school
football player Jake is your opponent. You're each going to take turns
throwing a football at these balloons. First to pop all four,
wins this hundred grand. And because Tom's seven Super Bowl
rings prove he's the greatest quarterback of all time, his balloons
are just a little bit smaller. Jake obviously
should throw first because he doesn't have seven
Super Bowl rings. Try to pop that first balloon. The first 1V1 begins right now! - That was the easiest one.
- Good throw. You're up, Tom. All right, here we go. He got it. That happened so fast. Now it's 20 yards away. Oh my gosh!
Two for two. There we go. Bro, he’s making it look easy! Tom, he's your enemy.
Stop fist bumping him. I mean I'm impressed. 20 yards which for Tom
should just be a routine. Woah! Bro! He actually missed. I blame the rain. Hey, did you call that rain in? Nope.
But I did call in Jake's high school football team to cheer him on.
Help him beat Brady. Jake! Jake! Jake! Come on, Jake. Jake! Jake! Hey, good try. Tom, surely you're not
going to miss a second time. I shouldn't. Throw it up! Easy. Alright, it’s now tied up. This one's the one,
I know it. This one's the one. Good throw, Jake. Good throw. All right, Tom,
you can start trying. It's not looking
good for our boy, Jake. You really got to dig deep here, man.
He hits one more, it's over. I know. That one hundred grand
is gonna go to charity. Do you guys believe in him!? He hasn’t won yet! And
it's Tom's throw. 50 yards. That's a long way, Jimmy. He's too old! That’s disrespectful.
You gonna take that? You'd think the most clutch quarterback
ever would breeze through this last round. But nailing a 50 yard dime for any
level passer was not gonna be easy. Jake, that was a great throw. You're not gonna get that many chances
with this man. Take advantage of it. Overrated! Overrated! Yo, Tom’s getting
closer and closer. The biggest moment of your life. You hit that.
You beat Tom Brady. You win 100 grand in front of your high
school and 200 million people watching. Come on Jake, you got this. Congrats on beating Tom Brady.
You won a hundred grand! We have so many more amazing
athletes in this video, including arguably the greatest football
player to ever play the sport, Cristiano Ronaldo. But right now, let's go see a normal
human race the fastest man in the world. This is Noah Lyles,
a triple world champion and Olympic gold medalist who is
currently the fastest human on earth. Unmatched in speed
by anyone alive. And for 100 grand, he's gonna
be racing Jonah, my friend. The fattest guy in the world. If Noah wins, I'll give
the money to charity. If Jonah wins, I'll put
it in his bank account. But Jonah has a negative
200 chance of beating Noah. Which is why we're
gonna give him a handicap. This race is going
to be 200 meters. But, Jonah, of course, I'll
give you a head start for a price. Every ten meters you
shave off, your total distance will cost you $10,000
of your prize money. Let's say you want
to start right here. This is a ten meter head start. Smoked within five seconds. Okay, let's try the next one. What about $80,000? Cooked. I actually think if you want a chance
of winning, you should probably do this. Forty grand is like a good chunk of change.
You could buy a new car. Okay, 40 it is.
We're doing it. Your official starting
point will be right here. Giving you a 60 meter head start
and the chance to win $40,000. I think he's gonna catch a
cramp before we get to the end. How do you do this? Your feet go on the pads. He definitely has about
half a football field on me. This is gonna be closer than
probably most people think. Okay, runners, are you ready? Let's see if Jonah can beat the
fastest man on the planet for $40,000. On your mark!
Get set! And they're off.
Oh, Jonah’s off! Jonah’s off! He’s gonna get me! Jonah, go! Go, go!
Go! Run! Run! Oh, my God!
He's gonna get me, dog. He's coming!
He's coming! Go! Go! He's gonna got me! Go! Run! Go Jonah! Run! Jonah! Run! Oh, he's taunting him.
He jogged through the finish line. Oh, my God that
wasn't even close. Oh, my God!
Bro, it’s like racing a cheetah. Throw me over your shoulder. I can’t. Why are you so sweaty?
Ew. Yo, he's on the ground. All right. Hit me again. Let me die. Noah won. He wants us
to donate it to his charity. And by the way, we're bringing
back Noah Lyles later in this video to race the fastest
streamer on earth, IShowSpeed. But for now, let's go hit
baseball with Bryce Harper. For our next 1V1, we
have arguably the greatest hitter on the entire
planet, Big Justice. Boom! He's been terrorizing
his little League. Yeah. And going up against
Big Justice is one of the most lethal hitters
baseball has ever seen. Wait, this is not fair. I’m ready. Bryce Harper’s Hall of
Fame level batting power has allowed him to
hit over 300 home runs, earning him two MVP
titles, eight All-Star bids, and even a Home
Run Derby championship. What’s up guys? Which is why you guys are gonna be
going head to head in a home run derby. I'm doomed. Nah you got this. But Big Justice is half
of Bryce Harper’s size, which is why his fence is half the
distance of Bryce Harper’s. You’re going down. Let's go get 'em, big kid. And just like every
other face off in this video, if Big Justice wins, we're
gonna wire him 100 grand. If Bryce Harper wins, we're gonna donate
100 grand to whatever charity he wants. Oh, well, then I kind of
want Bryce Harper to win. No, you both have
to try your hardest. Okay. Think about the Pokemon cards. Yeah, the Pokemon cards. Big Justice might be screwed. Yeah, no, Big
Justice has no chance. I'm so scared. He has ten swings.
Let's see how many homeruns he hits. Go down! That's more of a rainbow. Down, down, down! No way! Yeah! 0 for one.
He's not perfect. Chandler that’s you! Catch it bro. I ain't getting that. It hit the wall. Yeah! A hundred grand on the line. Oh my... Oh my gosh. That might be a
home run right there, bro. No! One for three. Try
to get in his head. Boom! Get up! It’s gonna hit the fence. Get up. Yeah! That was like a
foot from going over. No! That is out of the park! Bro, that was so cool. Let's go Bryce! Oh! Two for six! It stayed
in the Little League field. You're so good, Bryce. Wait, that... it's
out of the stadium. I think they need to make
bigger stadiums for Bryce. You got this. Yes! Oh, three for eight. If he only hits three... You have a shot.
Oh, that did not work. That's gonna hit the guitar. Another home run! I’m tired. Let's see if he
goes five for ten. Yeah! I got this. Four for ten. Oh, man. I’m tired. Here we go. Go get 'em. Big Justice might
beat Bryce Harper. I can see it. Big Justice between
me and you... Fire him up! I'm secretly cheering for you. Let’s go! You got this. Yeah! The only problem with that, he's
not wearing your number. It just... did not... Uh...
Wardrobe malfunction... Five home runs.
Big Justice is gonna bring the boom! -Boom!
-Boom! We need five!
Are you ready? Come on, buddy. Boom! -Yeah!
-He’s one for one. Boom! Yeah! Do that four more times. One for two. Hey, that's a rocket, though. No! Just missed it.
Just missed it. Okay. That's all right. Come on.
You got this. Another one! It's a home run.
Let's go! Boom! Let's go, baby.
Come on. Three more and he wins. I believe in Big Justice. You got this. You're halfway there. Yeah! - Yes!
- Yeah! Yeah! Three for five!
Two more and he wins! You got this. - Come on baby.
- Three for six. Come on! Three for seven. Come on.
You got this. Is there anything you
want to say to your son? You got this. Big Justice brings the boom! Come on, baby. That works! That
worked! The boom! Bring that boom, baby! Best moment of my life. You have two swings left.
You hit one of these two over, you win. Come on. You got this. Come on baby.
One more. Let's go right here.
End it right here, baby. Yeah! Keep going! That's a home
run, baby. Let's go! Yeah! - Yes!
- Yeah! He’s running the bases. Keep going.
You just beat Bryce Harper. Big Justice! I did not know
there's confetti there. That scared me.
Did that scare you? Look at him.
He's so happy. Big Justice goes boom! I'm proud of you, dude. That was sick. But just wait until you watch
Cristiano Ronaldo 1V1 a random guy. But right now, let's see how an amateur
golfer tees off against a professional. To my left it's Bryson DeChambeau,
two time major golf champion winner. And to my right is Aaron. And obviously Bryson, I think
it's fair to say is a better golfer. Yeah. That's why your hole will be
50 times bigger than his hole. All right. There's 100 grand on the line. You win,
I wire it in your bank account tomorrow. You win, I'll give it to
any charity you want. I can literally fit in this
hole. That's how big it is. The hole is 330 yards away. How many hits do you think it'll
take to get your ball in the hole? Four. You think four. Maybe three. Are you just going to try to yack it
all the way over there first swing? Yeah, just knock it
in the hole. No putts. How does that even make sense? Genetics. Genetics? Let's see what happens. Hundred thousand
dollars on the line! Whenever you're ready. Let's go, Bryson! Okay. That's pretty dang good. Thanks, Bryson. I'm actually really
impressed right now that you didn't hit it in the water.
Very impressed. -Thank you.
-Oh my gosh. Hurry up! One hole, Bryson. Alright Just swing the club! One of the best
golfers on the planet. I don't... I don't even
know where it went. Oh, that might be,
like, way over, dude. That might have gone
in the water, actually. I’m impressed! The hole’s that way,
but the ball went that way. How would you rate
your first shot out of ten? Not good. All right, right here's your
ball. We know because it's blue. And you can see he now
has a straight shot for the hole. If Bryson hit it in the water Oh my gosh I'm better than him Bryce, let's go find your ball. Just because Bryson can hit it further
doesn't mean it's always a good thing. So before we let Aaron hit, let's see if
Bryson will be penalized for his distance. All right, we're looking for his ball.
We're getting close to the hole. I’d say it should be up
by the green. If anything. We'll see about that. This is not looking good, folks. Yeah, I'm not seeing it. Nope. The ball went in the
water, so... When we place Bryson's
ball back onto the golf course, that will count as his second stroke. Which
means he'll be hitting his third shot next. All right, Aaron, let's
see what you can do. Technically speaking, he can
hit it right now and hit 100 grand. This is the one! Where’d I hit it? Right at the hole. All right, let's go. This is crazy.
No way. Oh, it's right
next to your ball! What?
Are you kidding me? What are the odds
they’re so close? With his game and my
game, it's crazy odds. Wow. That's a compliment, by the way. Thank you. Okay. First one today. Yep. Have you ever used
the Yahoo! sports app? Yeah. I use it for
fantasy football. Yeah. Exactly. They have a new
game called Daily Draw. Okay. Which we are announcing here! Is Jimmy really doing an ad right now?
In this very intense moment? This is a big swing. Which is why
while he's doing it, I want to tell you about the brand new game on the
Yahoo! sports app. Oh, that's very high up There it is, there it is.
Short of the green. Very short of the green. I
can see it because it's blue. Are you happy with that swing? I just need like, just classic Bryson.
Just miss a putt and I should be okay. Wow. Should be alright. Wow. Daily draw is a free to play game
available on the Yahoo! sports app. That's a great swing.
That's a phenomenal swing. Oh, that's looking good. That's
looking good. Oh, so close. And in daily draw you get cards. And you can use them to try to
predict the outcomes of games. If you predict
correctly you could win. Alright, I'm going to putt this. Whenever you're
ready. If you took the shot he's
about to take 100 times. I'd make it a 100. Okay. Yeah. Your whole life led
you to this moment. Will this putt win
you 100 grand? Oh, my gosh. It got caught on the grass. That might have been the most
embarrassing thing I've ever seen. I actually kind
of feel a little bad. Yeah. What happened, buddy? I want to give to charity. Clearly! And before what could be the final
swing, click the link in the description, download the
Yahoo! Sports app right now, and we’re going to be
giving $100,000 to people who get the MrBeast card
in their daily draw packs. That's $10,000 each day for ten days
straight, starting on December 20th. And if you sign up
for a game reminder, you can win a trip to meet
me and the boys for a day and get a selfie with
us while you're on set. No! Oh my gosh! Are you kidding me? Gotta make that Bryson! You know what... I think you
need some encouragement. We're gonna bring in your wife. Have you seen me? I've been watching you
from the bushes, yeah. No! Tell him it doesn't
matter if he loses. I can't do that. Oh my gosh. Oh, my heart's gonna explode.
Oh, I'm gonna try my best. Massive! Let’s go, Bryson! This will be clipped all
over Instagram if you miss. Okay. Somehow you guys tied,
so we're going to take these balls. Aaron, you'll hit from there. Okay. Oh, my gosh. That went farther. All right, let's have some fun.
For the tie breaker. Moment of truth. Oh, no! Nolan, watch out! Oh, no. That was a rocket. It's in the water. My wife's laughing, I hear her.
This hurts even more now. He gave it a valiant effort,
but let's finish the job. Oh, that's a great hit. Oh, it's on the green! Aaron hit the ball in the water.
We'll put his ball here. That is his swing.
Back to the golf professional. I need to finish this. Okay.
Oh! That's it. It rimmed out.
It came towards me. You got a chance, bro.
You got a chance. I suck at golf. I just can't shake this guy. For $100,000. Oh, that looks good. No, it's not There it goes right
over our heads. I hate this game.
If Bryson misses this, I have a chance. Last swing! It was a pleasure and an honor. You want to know something
that might cheer you up? What's that? How about the most popular
person I've ever had in a video? But before we go hang out with Ronaldo.
We're heading back to the racetrack. Because I wanted to give someone
else a shot at defeating Noah Lyles. And I had the perfect
person in mind. Why is MrBeast calling me right now y’all? Yo! Speed! Look who
I got right here. Oh, Noah! Noah! Race me! When you want to lose, man? I’ll actually end my stream right now
and drive there right now. And I couldn't believe it,
but Speed actually showed up to race Noah. Are you ready, man? Every moment was
made for me, buddy. Hey, you know my
name is Speed, right? You gave yourself that name.
That's so cute. This time, Speed, arguably the
fastest content creator on the planet thinks he can beat
the fastest man on the planet. I’m about to take his title. Didn't everybody at the
Olympics say that too? Oh my gosh I'm gonna steal
it from you, man. If you win again, that's another
hundred thousand dollars for your charity. If Speed wins, we'll give
100 grand to one of his fans. After the second step, you will lose all
hope and you will want to stop the race. Do not stop this race. My name’s Speed, man.
You about to really be in for a shock, bro. All right, this race is
going to be 50 meters. And if Speed wins, he'll officially
become the fastest man on the planet. Gentlemen, you both ready? Let's go. You know what?
Let's go, baby. On your mark... Set... Oh, they're going! Oh, Speed’s
ahead! Speed’s actually ahead! He's got a chance!
He might beat him! Oh my God, Speed! It’s going to be close. Oh! Oh my God.
That was so close! That was a tie.
That was a tie! Let's watch the video. That was a tie! I'm gonna go get my money. Just bringing you this, ultra slow
mo camera. You guys want to see it? I don't want to see it. Bro, that was a tie! Then why is the tape on me? Because you're sticky,
you're sweating. You're sweating too! What charity do you want
me to donate this 100 grand to? I'd love for Speed to have it... But the kids I'm
working for need it more. Oh my God. But before we meet up with Speed’s
favorite human in our final 1V1 matchup. I want to tell you that on December
19th, we are launching the greatest reality series ever made. With all
ten mind blowing episodes on Prime Video. This show features the most jaw
dropping content ever released on screen. But I'll tell you more about it
later. Because right now, it is finally time to meet up with the biggest
guest I've ever had on this channel. For $1 million, Khalid is
going to be going head to head against the ultimate football
phenomenon, Cristiano Ronaldo. The thing standing between
you and this million dollars in your bank account is Ronaldo. I put my lucky shirt with MrBeast. He's like my number one fan. He's your number one fan? I'm his number one fan. You're stuttering. You're nervous.
Bro, lock in, this is a lot of money! The rules of this
contest are simple. Both of you will be taking
shots at the targets on the goal. First to hit three targets wins.
And if Khalid can somehow beat Ronaldo, I'm going
to give him $1 million. Can I just take it with me? No, you gotta beat him first. What are the odds you
think you'd beat Ronaldo? Honestly, I think it's 50/50. Do you agree with that? I like him to be confident. Okay, yeah. Whenever you're ready, it is on you.
100 million people watching. All right. No points yet.
Ronaldo, you're up. Okay. Let's go. Oh! They both missed,
they both missed! I think... that was
probably the only blessing you're going to get
this whole video. This may be your last
chance to get ahead. Yeah! Excuse me.
Excuse me, Ronaldo. You are currently
beating Ronaldo. Wow. But you need two more. Oh my gosh. This is a lot! This is not a lot.
Just you win. All right, let's see
why you're the GOAT. Khalid, you could
become a millionaire! Two more.
What is going on? So close. All right. Now Ronaldo has a chance
to tie it up. Let's see if he hits it. Khalid, do not give
another one bro. Khalid, with this
ball you’re gonna... -I’m going to hit?
-Yes. You just blessed that ball. I believe in you. I think Ronaldo wants
me to lose $1 million. All right, let's see it Khalid. Oh my god! Siuuuuu! As unbelievable as this
was, Khalid was now up by two, which meant that
the only way Ronaldo could win was by hitting
all three targets before Khalid hits one. You think you can hit
the next three in a row? Honest? No! Really? Okay. I'm not confident. This could be the start of the
biggest comeback in history. Okay. Oh, my God, this might be it.
This literally might be it! Khalid. This is your chance to win
$1 million and change your life forever. Khalid, let's go. Good luck. Thank you. Give him space! Come on Khalid! I'm so proud of you, my friend. Here is $1 million! Hey Ronaldo, can you
tell them to subscribe? Yeah, Yeah. All the
guys, who, who follow Cristiano they have to
subscribe to MrBeast. That's not what I said,
but I'll take it! End the video! On December 19th,
I'm officially dropping the long awaited 
Beast Games on Prime Video. I gathered a thousand contestants
to compete for $5 million the biggest cash prize
in entertainment history. With ten episodes of pure chaos, betrayal
and the highest stakes ever filmed. You have to see what happens. Every single episode is
a thousand times better than any YouTube
video I've ever done. I can't wait to
see you all there."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj0Jtjg3lHQ,"$1 vs $500,000 Experiences!",1060,20241102,en,"I'm about to show you what a
half $1 million experience looks like. I promise this is going
to blow your mind. In this video, you will find out
why it cost a quarter of $1 million to simulate going to space. Why it costs $50,000 to explore
the depths of our oceans. Whoa! It's coming right at us! And every other experience
we tried along the way. I'm standing on top of the
tallest building in the world! Oh my God! All the way down to the
cheapest experience I could find. Riding a camel. How long can I ride
this camel for a dollar? One dollar, two minute. Deal. That's a
great $1 experience. Hold on tight. Wait.
Hold on tight, why? Oh my God. I wanted to ride camels in Egypt,
but they're way more than a dollar. So I'm gonna throw
the pyramids up in post Yo! Yeah. It's beautiful. Dude, this is a workout
to stay on this thing. I mean, I'm so
high up in the sky. Now you know what it's
like to be me and Chandler. Okay. Well, $1 only got us two
minutes and that time is up. Let's go have dinner in the sky. For $10,000, you can
go 3000 feet in the sky with a chef who uses this
hot air balloon as her kitchen. You can see the shadow from
the balloon over there in the field. Dude! This is a little higher than I
expected, I'm not gonna lie. But this isn't your everyday
dinner at 3000 feet in the air. This Michelin star chef uses the
flame from the hot air balloon itself to literally cook the food
for the meal she's preparing. MrBeast. Oh. Yo! That's our next
course of food, bro. Now, we're about to
have fish that they cooked with the fire from the
hot air balloon. Oh, thank you. Oh my gosh. Jimmy, this is amazing. Look how beautiful it is down there.
Such an amazing view while we eat. This fish never dreamed
of being this high up. If you got an extra ten grand and want
to impress a girl, I would recommend this. Every single one of these ten
gourmet courses was phenomenal. But I still had one
question I needed to ask. As a Michelin star chef, what do
you think of this Feastables bar? Very good on balance. And
what I like is the crunch in the chocolate. Feastables is now Michelin star approved.
The 10K experience was very beautiful. Amazing. Up next is the 50K
experience and Chandler and Karl have no idea what
I have in store for them. What do you think of the yacht? I think it's beautiful.
It's pretty. Yeah. Do you think it costs
50 grand for the day? No. Okay. So look over there. We're gonna go on a
submarine expedition. Oh my God. You guys ready to explore
the floor of the ocean? Yeah! Okay, let's do this. - What?
- We're not doing that. Let's head over. Okay. Come on. Yeah! Let's go explore the
floor of the ocean. - Okay.
- All right. This is awesome. Whoa!
I can already see fish. Look! We haven't
even gone down yet. Look it’s a barracuda! You guys want to scrape the
floor of the ocean? We can. We can do anything. We have this entire submarine to
ourselves and can explore whatever we want. Let's do everything. Except crashing.
We are not allowed to do that. Okay. And to make sure we got the
very best angles down here. We paid scuba divers
to follow the submarine. Isn't this cool? Let's communicate
with them ""Shark behind"" everyone freak out.
Okay? Start freaking out. Got'em! While we're underwater,
Tareq and Nolan are also on a $50,000
safari in Africa. And we're gonna see if we see
more cool creatures down here than they do over there. Spoiler.
We will. This is gorgeous. All right, let's go find
the king of the jungle. We cannot leave Africa until we
see a lion. Do you understand? I do understand. Why did
you point at me like that? Look, look, look. Oh, warthog! Yo, it’s Pumba! You scared him. You scared him. I'm sorry, I shouldn't yell.
I was not supposed to yell. Zebras! I feel like zebras
would taste good. Like if I was a lion, I'd always go
for a zebra. They just look thick. What? Bro, this is so worth $50,000. Yeah. This is so
worth Jimmy’s $50,000. Wait, Karl, what if instead of
being a ship that's a submarine? We're taking this
thing back up again. Wow, look at how close
we are to those rocks. Is it okay? How close we are? - Yeah, it's okay.
- All right. But we weren't the only ones
getting up close and personal. Zebras! Where are you going? Hey, buddy.
Wait! Don't go. Come back! Tareq, let's talk about
the elephant in the room. There's two right behind you. They are unnervingly close. They're very close. Oh, it's awfully close.
It is coming towards us. We just got charged
by an elephant. Oh, it's there! -It's the coolest thing ever!
-Look at him! That thing is a unit. That’s my dad. This is way cooler
than a submarine. I’d rather see this than a fish. Also, my heart’s beating
out of my chest right now. And that was the 50k experience. What
we have coming up next is even better. This thing pales
in comparison to the $250,000 zero
gravity experience. This company will fly
you up and then nosedive, creating a zero gravity
environment inside the plane. The $250,000
experience starts now. Oh my water! Wow. Oh my God! I'm upside down! Oh my God. Oh, I
can’t stop floating! Go long! Oh, that was awesome. Oh my gosh, this is sick! On this next drop, we're
gonna race to the other side. Turn on zero gravity. -Oh, yeah.
-Dude! I’m winning! I can’t go anywhere! Nolan's losing. We made it! -We made it.
-We won! Guys! Turns out racing without
gravity doesn't work so well. But luckily, Karl
had a better idea. I'm gonna test
out a leaf blower. All right, wait for it. He’s spinning! Oh God! -He’s actually spinning!
-Stop! Oh my God. And before we turn
the gravity off again. We’re gonna try to make some of our
MrBeast Lab Swarms in zero gravity. - You ready?
- Yeah. Nolan, let's
try to make some! I created the coolest toys ever. All you have to do is
pour water into the tube, shake it and you'll find
out which Swarms you got. I’m gonna squirt some water. Give me some! We’re getting swarmed
by these toys right now. This isn’t as easy as I thought. Anyways,
there's over 119 Swarms to collect. You can find Swarms in packs
of five, packs of two and singles available at Walmart, Target,
and Amazon in the United States and everywhere around the
world at your top toy retailers. It’s my favorite toy! -I’m weightless.
-Go get it at your local Walmart. These are the most
exciting toys this holiday season and they're
flying off the shelves. Karl, catch! Make sure you buy MrBeast Labs 
before they're sold out. That's going to be cool. Hold on, Nolan, catch. Yeah. Body slam! I have no idea how the $500,000
experience is going to top this. But let's go find out. And after going all around
the entire world to film this video... We’re at
the $500,000 experience. This is the craziest view ever. Unlike any spectacle seen
before in the history of mankind, my friends and I are about to
see what half a million dollars can allow you to experience in the most
luxurious metropolis in the entire world. The city of Dubai, a place carved
from the desert but created for pleasure. And at the end of
this video, I'm going to become one of the few
individuals in history to stand on top of the
tallest building in the world. We went all out. It is
going to blow your mind. Let's go have some fun. How are we here? So after we found our way
off this 500ft picture frame, we made our way over
to this castle of a hotel. Wow. This is insane. Water in our backyard. The first two floors of this
hotel room are magnificent. But the coolest one, by far, is the
third level that's completely underwater. Oh my God! Welcome to Atlantis. We love
you all. Except for you, Karl. Sorry, man. He went into a thing with
sharks just to make fun of me. For the record, there is
over 80 sharks in this tank. And later in this experience, we're
actually going to be swimming with them. And for the cherry on
top to wrap all this up. Come on. We're going to go skydiving. No way. Yes! Dude, falling from thousands
and thousands of feet in the air. Don't worry about that.
Let's go race F1 karts. Yeah. What better place to do so
than at the Dubai Autodrome? Home to some of the
fastest cars in the entire city. Just grab whatever car
you want. Let's go race. - All right.
- Let's go. And I called up some of
the biggest local creators to have a field
day with these supercars. Let's have some fun. They're going so fast. And this is just the first of many
experiences we're going to be doing here. We are just getting started. I'm ready to race! We’re about to lap someone.
We're catching up to them. Oh no, Jimmy! No, no. Come on, grandma. I don't think my mom
will be happy watching me race. I don't think she could
drive slower if she wanted to. That's illegal. Okay.
That's like. That's really illegal. While my friends and I were
pretending to be race car drivers. Woo! Karl was getting ready to drive
an actual Formula level race car. I look so cool now.
Let's do this thing. Off to a rocky start. Oh my God, I'm driving a formula car!
This is the best day of my life! For the price of this
experience, we actually got to keep
this brand new Lamborghini. I want to enjoy it a little bit. In case you were curious,
this bad boy is fast. Let's go to an NBA game,
all the way in Abu Dhabi. But to be honest, guys, I'm
not the kind of guy who likes to drive around sports cars and
plus, we cannot find a parking spot. So, I'm just going to find
someone to give this thing to. Do any of you watch
the MrBeast channel? Yup! That says subscribed!
Can I just give you this Lamborghini? I’d prefer someone
else to have it. What? What the
heck just happened? Hey, sir.
Security, can you come over here? Oh, he’s subscribed!
Can I just give you this Lambo? Yeah, please. All right, get in. This is
officially your Lamborghini. I am actually shaking right now. This is why you gotta
make sure you're subscribed. I'd hate for you to
lose a Lamborghini. Hey, boys. What are you doing?
We got courtside tickets. Enjoy! I am so happy. With the Lamborghini
now off my hands, I gotta sit courtside at a pro
basketball game. But instead, it just ended
up turning into a photoshoot. Nice to meet you! Then afterwards, I
said hi to Steve Harvey. Nice to finally meet you! How you feeling? I’m doing good!
And after that, Russell Westbrook. -Y’all good?
-Good. And with $200,000 worth
of experiences left to do. Up next, we got to take
over a massive water park. Somehow in the middle of the
desert, hang out with penguins. I heard you're the alpha.
That is an alpha thing to do. And since that wasn't enough, I am now in
a giant pool with 80 sharks and stingrays. Hello there, sir. Hey! Hey! Come back here!
I was trying to talk to you. He's like Buzz Lightyear. Whoa! Oh, excuse me, sir.
Yo, we got some... I am Aquaman, the
king of the sharks. My first decree is the
sharks bite him and not me. Agreed? Oh, attack Karl! That is a dinosaur! I am your leader. Attack him. No! That should not exist. I think they just
unplugged my oxygen. Well, before this guy turns
me into fish food, let's go get our own dinner at a restaurant
straight out of the future. Hello, everybody. Jimmy, you’re sitting there. What is this, Jimmy? I don't know. I don't
think I've ever sat at a restaurant this far
away from my friends. Gentlemen, prepare yourself
for a once in a lifetime experience. We will start with our first
appetizer. Take it in one bite! Cheers. Cheers. What if I don't like it? Is it good? This is amazing. That whole plate
was just that one bite? Yeah. Okay. Whoa.
What is going on? What? It's like a
Call of Duty mission. Am I getting hacked? I thought this was a
restaurant, not a movie theater. I don't know what's going on. This nine course meal
is surrounded by full 360 interactive visuals that
change based on the dish. Whoa! Wait, does it, oh,
it responds to your touch. Boy’s we're now defending Earth. I'm impressively bad at this. But even though the
room was impressive. Dude, they're getting tripped up
on my water right now. Look at that. It was the one of a kind food and drinks
that made this experience truly unique. You can touch
the glass it’ll react with you. We got to try nine mouthwatering
courses from freshly caught seafood. Whoa! Oh my God. To golden wagyu burger. You approve? Oh, yeah. Hey, we found
one Chandler likes. They even had one final
course specialized just for us. Who is that? Thats Chandler. That is not... Bro, that is not me. But anyways, let's keep
the experience going. All we have left before
I literally fall out of the sky and climb the
tallest building on earth is to test my fear of heights
at a pool suspended in the sky. Look at this view. Jimmy! Oh my God. Are you kidding me? Whatever you're seeing right
now does not do this justice. No way. Standing over 600ft in the sky, this
360 degree infinity pool gives you a breathtaking view
of every square inch of the city. Let's hop on in boys. Yeah, I'm getting in. That island behind me is man made.
Everything about this is mind blowing. Now we're going to stick
this bad boy over the ledge. Jesus, man. Check out the view. Is that not amazing? We're on top of Dubai. All right, guys. It's time
we fall from the sky. Dude, you're
just falling to the Earth. No, you're falling to
this manmade island. Oh my God,
I'm so scared. Buckle up because what
you're about to witness, I never thought I’d
do in my entire life. Literal maniacs.
Who does this willingly? But what would a video
about experiences be without attempting to face
one of my biggest fears. Falling out of the sky. If I don't make this
still upload the video! This is getting real. No! I have a family! Prepare for takeoff. It’s getting real!
We're going up! I know. I can't believe we're
actually doing this. This is nuts. What are the odds I die? I don't know. Oh my God! Approaching
ten thousand feet. We are so high. I'm not ready. Jimmy! I'm not ready. Go! Come on! You're going first. Jimmy, I hate you!
I changed my mind! Oh, my God. Yeah!
We're spinning! Oh, God. I'm scared! Bye Jimmy! I don't wanna do this! Oh my God!
This is terrifying! I'm not going! How was it? I'm scared. You're scared. Yeah. We're still
pretty high up. This is probably
my biggest fear ever. Oh, gosh.
But I did this for you guys. Okay. I'm not dead.
I'm alive. Where’s Chandler?
Did Chandler not jump? Where's Chandler? Chandler either didn’t jump
or splatted on the ground. Oh, God, I hope
he didn’t jump. Sorry Jimmy, I’m not doing it! Well it’s a good thing I didn't
ask Chandler to join me on the biggest experience
of this whole video, because... Behind me is the Burj Khalifa, the tallest building on
Earth. And to wrap up this experience, I'm
going to go stand all the way on top of it. The first step of reaching
the peak of this 2700ft building is taking a series of
elevators over 160 stories into the sky. But as for the
remaining 900ft, I had no choice but to climb to the top myself.
This thing is tall. That is a lot of ladders. I underestimated how
hard it is to get up to the top. But even after a full hour of climbing, there was still a lot of
skyscraper left to go. I thought I finally made it to the top,
but there's still a lot left. This thing never ends.
Step by step, I started to question whether I really
wanted to keep going. I don't know if I'm going to make it.
Surely we’re almost there. Take that as a no. But
despite all this endurance, I reminded myself that this was my
moment to be one of the few individuals ever to experience standing on
top of the tallest building on Earth. I knew there was no turning back. Alright. Homestretch!
Woo! Alright. I made it! I'm standing on top
of the tallest building in the world! This is insane! Holy crap. I'm high up. Oh, this is terrifying. Oh, I shoudn’t have looked
down that’s scary. I might puke. I’ll admit, Feastables tastes better on the
ground, because on the ground I'm not on the verge of passing out.
I'm so afraid of heights. I find time and time again
that when I face my fears, I usually end up enjoying it
and learning a lot about myself. I'm very grateful for this
experience, and I would encourage you guys to go
outside your comfort zone. Do something you
wouldn't normally do. I think you'll end up enjoying it
and learn a lot about yourself. Thanks for watching! I hope you enjoyed
all the effort we put in this video! I love you guys!"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bn0Kh9c4Zv4,7 Days Exploring An Underground City,1235,20241012,en,"We are going to be spending the next seven
days in this massive underground city. How does this place exist? Although it may look like
something straight out of the future, this city is built inside a mine,
dating back over a thousand years ago and with countless uncharted
tunnels and chambers. Who knows what horrors we’ll run into. These are the stairs
that descend into the city. How old are these stairs? Older than us. All right, now that we're down here.
Look at how high up the ceiling is. We are 400ft underground right now
and somehow this village just exists. This is nuts. During World War Two, when
Romania was getting bombed, thousands of people would hide here. And now just a bunch
of YouTubers live here. And soon enough, we found a
solid place to spend the night. I think we should camp here. You're the boss. Our stuff is all
the way up there. So with home base decided,
we went up to grab our bags and using all our
collective brainpower, we discovered the best way
to get them down to camp. Oh! That's awesome. That’s dead on! We just finished fishing
everything out of the water Our food for the challenge
consists of bagged food, and we each brought
a personal bag. What's in yours Karl? Let's look at somebody else's. You get the point. You guys want to know
what the craziest part is? We've barely seen any
of this underground city. The walls that surround us
are hiding a bunch of tunnels. There's even a chamber as
massive as the one we’re in now. Where? What? However, what these guys
don't know is that every single day I'm bringing a famous YouTuber
to help us explore these tunnels. But the more YouTubers that joined us,
the deeper this city would fall into chaos. You just got here, bro. We're going to bed
at a reasonable hour because I have a big
surprise in the morning. That's ominous Day one in the underground city was a
success. We'll see you in the morning. Good morning. bro why? It's gonna be a great day. First thing in the morning, I took everyone
to the elevator for my big announcement. Starting today, every single morning, a
famous YouTuber is going to be joining us. Our surprise guest, coming
down from the surface is JiDion! Welcome to the underground city. This is legit a city. There's even a Ferris wheel here. Yeah, but that's not all. So we have not been up these stairs yet, and is not that the most ominous
stairs you've ever seen in your life? Boys, come up here. Lazarbeam has a fear of heights. Why are we doing this to me? Today we're conquering
your fear of heights. Oh my gosh. How are you so calm? If I'm gonna die, I'm gonna
die, I'm not gonna worry about it. Oh, God. All right, we have a
lantern to go exploring. I feel so much safer now. Well, don't get too comfortable, because just around the corner,
we found this menacing door. Access forbidden. Oh heck no - Wait.
- I'll check it out. Oh no, no, no. Alright guys, looks safe! Are we sure there's not like people
living down here or something? Only one way to find out. This does feel like
a very haunted area. Oh, no. These boards either held up a sign that
said don't enter that someone ripped down It definitely did. Or they're just
here for decoration. I think they're here for
decoration. Follow me! This doesn’t look creepy at all. Hey everyone, for 1000 years they've
harvested salt from the salt mine. This is a dark chocolate
sea salt Feastables bar. Hear me out. What if we put
more salt on our sea salt bar? Straight from the source. That's so good. It tastes really good. And for climbing
multiple sets of stairs. Where is this leading us? I'm not sure. Going where we
probably shouldn't. Wait. What does
this say? Do not pass. What does that mean? Karl, put your hands like this. Dude. We probably can't
put this on camera. As eerie as these tunnels were, the creepiest were still yet to come as
we ventured back to camp for the night. As you can see, 
JiDion joined us in the bed-ring. Tomorrow's gonna be a fun day.
We have a super special guest. We’ll see you in the morning. Alright. It's the start of day three,
and you know what that means. Let's go see who the special
guest of the day is. Send them down! I see a shadow! 
There he is! Is it Kai? Maybe it’s Speed? I see two shadows! There's two of them?! Today the two guests are! Sam and Colby! Yeah! If you don't know already, Sam and Colby specialize in exploring
abandoned and haunted places, so it'll be interesting
to see what they think when we explore this
1000 year old tunnel system. Are we going? See how high the ceiling is? Well apparently, there's like a
window where you can look down and I want to see Lannan’s reaction
because he's terrified of heights. Meanwhile, the others are
going to upgrade our base camp. Alright, alright, you’ll do stuff here,
and then you'll do stuff over there. Oh I get it, you're
a supervisor. Yeah! Yeah. Has no clue what's
going on and tells us what to do. Alright, let's get to
work. Let's get to work. As we went deeper than before, I never could have guessed how
sketchy exploring these tunnels would get. I think Sam and Colby should lead the
way because they have more experience We love creepy holes, you know? That makes sense. Yeah, lead the way. You're getting farther
and farther away. I'm right behind you. Oh, we got two ways. This way. Karl! I got Colby so good That scared the crap out of him. Anyway, we kept walking until we eventually
came across this ominous staircase. This is sketch! There's just a
gigantic cross up here. Wait wait wait, really? What do we make of this cross? The one thing that we
know about these salt mines is there is a legend that
there was one spirit seen, and they created an
altar at that location because it's where the
hauntings are, this is the spot. That sounds awesome!
Let's keep going! Yo, that’s the hole
that leads to the camp. Oh, is that the hole? I feel like there's a
fence for a reason. Should I go over there? I’ll watch from here. Dude, I can see our camp! Look! Shawn! Oh, they're way up above us. How's it going? We have a shower boys! They just yelled
we have a shower. How did you do that? First we'll make a shower head out of
the cap and then we'll hang our water jug. Lannan! Come check this out! I'm coming. Lannan, you can't be
this afraid of heights. I'm coming bro, I'm
coming. This is okay. No, no, no.
No one touch me. We're overcoming our fears. Having now explored
50% of the mines and with a way to
wash our reeking bodies, this underground
city was finally thriving. But there was still plenty to do because by the next
morning, we had to welcome our day four special guest
coming down the elevator! Wait they’re short! Is the biggest Twitch streamer
on the planet, Kai Cenat! Welcome to the underground city! Alright Kai I want you to jump
and stomp as loud as you can. What the heck? Kai now that you’re
here, we have a big family. And nothing's gonna
get between any of us. Is that foreshadowing? Bro, you just got here! Oh God! Kai, I specifically saved
one secret tunnel for you. So let’s go explore it! So using these boats, we
crossed the underground lake. That's right, a lake,
that's underground. And on the other side, our next set of
tunnels was through this hole in the wall. Karl should go first. I'll go first. There's a door in the hole. What is behind that door? We got to get in
there, that is awesome. You got it, you got it, you got
it, you got it. Oh my God. So after a boost from Shawn
we were ready to explore - See you Shawn!
- Bye Shawn! I see this in movies all the time. When
we get past the door, we're gonna die. What's the game plan? You gotta go straight,
then you gotta make a left, then right is always right,
so make that U-turn half circle opposite of your left hand side. But once you go straight,
you take five steps back. Okay? So after trekking through
this sketchy tunnel... What happened? What? It literally just opened
up into a giant dark void. They told me there was another
cavern just as big as the other one, so I thought it'd be fun if we
brought the world's brightest flashlight. - Dude
- What? This is unreal! Hey wait, be careful
there are ledges here Yeah I'm gonna jump. Wait you're gonna jump? Bye guys! Kai where are you going? Bye! If it’s safe for him... Yeah this is cool! - Together!
- Together! Hello! It sounds like I’m over there! Now they're all down there
in the middle of the cavern, I’m gonna turn the
flashlight off to scare them. Ready? - Hey!
- What we doing. Come on! Come on! They're leaving us. Hurry! Come on, come on, come on. Come on, come on, come on. Lock them in! He's leaving us! Oh God! Later nerds! Open it! You’re gonna break Karl’s arm! Pull! Pull! I’m letting go. Hey man! What? What’s what? Is y’all trying to leave us? No! I heard you say “later losers” Who? You! No... He tried to trap us
in there for a night. No no, you can stay down there. So with tensions running high
after a long day of exploring, we decided to turn in for the night,
but Karl was about to strike again and this time with JiDion’s help. We're going to prank
the rest of the team. Everyone's asleep right now. We're gonna have this mannequin standing on
the bridge and have a speaker behind him. We’re gonna play Kai’s song
""Bustdown Rollie Avalanche."" We ready? I think we’re... Are we being attacked? They’re playing my song That’s your song? Yes. See that light over there? All the way at the top? At least it’s a good song though Whoever has done this has
made a great enemy in their life. What are you gonna do
tomorrow to get your revenge? Oh boy. I will dedicate my entire
life to their destruction. I will wipe them and their
entire family from existence. Lines are being drawn,
enemies are being formed. These last few days
are gonna be interesting. I'm gonna try to go back to bed. I'm the only one
awake right now. Everyone is still asleep
after what Karl did last night. I think our guest is about to arrive.
They're coming down right now. - Yo. What’s good, bro?
- It’s Logan Paul. Usually Jimmy's here to give a
tour, but he's asleep right now. - You can go wake him up.
- Oh, I'm going to do that. Yeah, you want to go do that. Good morning Logang!
What's poppin’? Chandler’s excited to
see you man, I can tell. Our day five guest is
WWE superstar Logan Paul. Let's go. This video is just me seeing how
many famous people I can drag in this pit. Hey, guys. You know
someone who's not here? Karl. JiDion. Last night, it was Karl and JiDion
just like running pranks on us and I think I can speak for everyone
here, they’re getting exiled today. This was Karl’s bed he
wont be using this anymore. Hope where he’s sleeping
now is comfortable. I was sick of that guy anyway. Alright, LazarBeam’s
going a little crazy. One final thing, I
think Karl is still asleep. We're going to go wake him up. Wakey, wakey. Oh my god. I just woke up to Logan Paul. Karl, I got a surprise for you. You might be a bit sleepy,
but just come up here, buddy. So I threw your
bed into the water. Dude I hate this
underground city, bro. With the prank war actually
started to bother some people, Kai decided to step up and
become the mayor of the city. Does anybody object
of me being mayor? I vote that the shortest
person here be the mayor. I don't object. To establish some
order in the city Mayor Kai first punished JiDion
and Karl for last night's prank and I've got to warn you, with this city's population having
grow to now nine YouTubers, everything you're gonna witness
from here on out is just pure chaos. Alright, you’ll sleep
in the elevator. Elevator? If they’re in the elevator,
how do we get up? We gotta take 15 flights of stairs, Kai? You're not thinking! Bro! You just got here, bro! - You just got here last night.
- Bro! Why is he the mayor?
I'm just gonna say it. Alright, we need to start
acting on these orders. You guys, go ahead and
carry your stuff to the elevator. Enjoy your dictatorship. Hey, enjoy your elevator. Yeah, enjoy your
elevator, buddy. Bro, me laying down this
way is looking like a penthouse. And me laying like
this is still an elevator. Now that the criminals are
gone, Kai, what do you want to do? First things first. I think we should have a place just
for storage. It should go right there. So just to clarify, we're moving
our belongings away from our beds for no reason. No, because Kai told us. Honestly, this does nothing. Now
we just have to work for our clothing. Alright, maybe making Kai
Mayor wasn't such a great idea. So after doing some more
of Kai's ridiculous demands, the day one boys and I set
off on our daily exploration. Alright, we’ll be
back in like two hours. So while we've explored just about every
tunnel and room in this underground city, I have a special one here
that I really want to show you. - You see this dead end right here?
- Yeah. What if I told you
it's a fake dead end? No! Dude, what is this? There you go. What?! There's a fake door
that led to a giant tunnel! Where's the
tunnel lead to though? Let's find out. Alright, get this, the tunnel was so
long, we literally had to run down it. It’s still going! This is the longest tunnel
I've ever seen in my life. I see the light. And at the end of the tunnel
is a Zaxby's! That I built. Yo! Brand new MrBeast Box
available in every single Zaxby's that comes with the Feastables bar. And meanwhile, back at camp, the other
boys had way too much time on their hands. I think we move all their
beds to the bridge bro. That's the day one bridge.
This is the new gens. Let’s do it. Let's go. I got Jimmy’s. And then I'll grab Lazar’s. I've never been this
happy in my entire life. The MrBeast Box
comes with great chicken, your favorite sides from Zaxby's, and it's about to
disappear forever so if you haven't
tried it, go get it now. Zaxby's also has a ton of sauces. This is good. This is good sauce. Yeah, right here. Perfect. For the first 30 days in October, we're giving away $10,000 in a random
drawing for people who buy Feastables and on Halloween night, we're
giving one lucky winner $1 million. Just post a photo of you holding a
Feastables bar and tag Feastables. The Feastables bars
in these MrBeast boxes can also be used to
enter into the giveaway. I'm so happy right now. Don't miss out. Go get yourself a MrBeast
box from Zaxby's while you still can. I think we're all
on the same page. The other people in the city
do not need to know about this. We did not eat Zaxby’s. Now, what I failed to realize is what would happen when you
leave a bunch of content creators alone, with nothing to do for hours. Why do you guys
have ski masks on? While you guys were gone, we made
sure that we made this a better city. So we’re gonna have a town hall meeting
to discuss the new changes that we've made. - Okay.
- All right. This better be good. - Are you guys ready?
- Kai, what the heck is going on? Welcome to York New City. 
This is our current state. Everything is just so messy.
It looks bad, right? Go to the next slide. We let the new gen
sleep here from now on. So what about the day one-ers? You guys are now on the bridge. But we have a master bedroom. Somebody is
sleeping on the raft. Alright, I think
I've seen enough. Day one-ers come on, come
on. I'm taking my day one-ers. Come on, come on, let's go. Have fun. Yo, where y’all going? No, we can't let him get
back to the base before us. You’re right. No, no, no! Shawn, stop them! Shawn! No! Kai, we all wanted to talk
to you about something. What? You've turned into a dictator. - What?
- Honestly, really quickly. We’ve got to move
our beds over here. I quit bro! 
I hate being mayor bro. You gotta make all the rules up
and stuff and everybody gotta follow it. I almost broke my neck. You good? As a show of
peace, I brought you some food. If you guys follow me here, 
I brought all of you Lunchly’s. I get a Prime and Feastables? Nice, the cheese
tastes like actual cheese. It's good. Fire. It actually is so good. So after a day of
establishing a new leader, toppling a corrupt government, and then becoming friends again, 
we decided to call it a night. Alright. Good night, you hooligans.
We'll see you tomorrow. Good morning everybody. Will everyone please
meet me at the elevator. Who do you guys think the next
inhabitant of the underground city is? I think it's IShowSpeed. He's literally
streaming right now in Romania. It's the entire Sidemen. Could be Jynxzi. All right, let's see who it is. That’s Speed. That’s
Speed, I can tell. Send them down! That’s a massive box. It's a girl. Oh, it could be a girl. Our day six special guest of
the seven days underground city. All right, here we go. What is that gigantic box? Lannan you're going to be excited for this
box. All your favorite things are in here. - Which way do you want me to open it?
- Just open it. Let’s go! For day six, we actually have
two guests. Vikkstar and Speed. So boys, welcome to
the underground city. Yeah, we've done this tour like
6 or 7 times at this point right? Alright, follow me, boys. If you guys want, we can hit
the highest point of this cave. As long as you promise
me you won't jump. It's not too high though.
Wait, is that water? - Do not jump, bro.
- It’s water, though. No! Stop! Stop! I ain’t gonna lie bro, I love y'all,
but y'all stink. You stink, I promise. Hey Speed! Dude, y'all stink I'm
not even playing, bro. You just look like you stink. I just took a shower. There's no showers here, though. You'll see. - Stop lying.
- Oh my God. You're lying! Bro, your lying!
Stop lying! That's must! It's must! How do you smell? Lift it up. Dude, get out of there. Is that Old Spice? Yes. You know! Good move, stinky boy. Get
your hands away from me. And unsurprisingly, the first thing
Vikkstar and Speed wanted to check out was the underground
soccer arena. Y’all played a game
yet or no in here? - No.
- No. How have you not played a game?
What have you been doing for seven days? Blue is on a team. Chandler,
Speed, Logan over here. - Y’all got all the athletes.
- Vikky sucks! Bro, thats a stacked team! It's even. All
right, let's do it. Come on, Speed. Come
on, Speed. Whats up? Go back! Jidion, Jidion. Kick it! Punt it! 
I have... Keep scoring!
Kick it as hard as you can! Go ahead! Blue team won. Blue teams won. Let's
keep the tour going. As we were going to
check out the golf course, we caught something on
camera never seen before. We caught Logan
without Prime. It's so weird. Don’t put that in.
Don’t put that in. After soccer, we
played some golf, which, honestly, Lazar
could use some practice with. I'll give you $100 if
you get a hole in one. - Right here?
- Yup. We even climbed the
massive Ferris wheel. You do some dumb stuff
when your bored, huh? If I get injured, the WWE
is going to be pissed. So will my fiancé, though. I'm going to be a dad. What
am I doing up here, dude? We also projected a video
game on the cave wall. We’re creating
history right now. We're the first ones that ever play
in here. Hole too big! Hole too big! And lastly, we climbed
to the very top of this cave just to play the most insane
game of catch you've ever seen. The only thing stopping
us from falling is this wood. It’s not even stable. Let's get in position,
boys. Let's get in position. Yo, Lazar, try to catch
this Feastables bar. Here we go. Here we go. It's a parachute. And just for you to understand
how high up we were, it took nearly ten entire seconds for
our Feastables to reach the ground. Oh, that is coming
down. Oh, God. Alright, dropping
some marshmallows. Here they come! Catch it. I see them! One! Two! Karl! Dude, it's so close. Hey, Logan. Got a
Prime bottle for you. - You got it, you got it. 
- You got it. Come on, baby! Let’s go! Of course, when it's
Prime, he catches it. And for the last
night in the city, we made a campfire in the
amphitheater to wind down. All right everybody, what was
your favorite part of the video? Well, it's actually
going to be leaving. I enjoyed the friends I made. Yeah. I enjoyed toppling
the dictatorship. Why is he the mayor? Enjoy your dictatorship. I quit bro!
It's too much work. My favorite part was just dragging all
these YouTubers to the middle of nowhere, deep underground, and forcing them
to hang out with me. It was a lot of fun. I'm grateful for you all coming out.
Thank you so much. And boys, with only one day
left in this underground city, we've really started
to fill this room up. All right, cut the lights off. We'll see you
tomorrow for day seven. All right, guys, good night. - Good night.
- Good night everybody. What a wonderful day! Time to go home. Please hurry. And after we cleaned
up the entire camp, it was finally time to
leave this underground city. This was fun. 
I'm gonna miss all of you. I just got here why
is everyone leaving? I've been here forever.
I can't wait to leave. Our first time seeing
sunlight. In a week! Ah, it's so bright, dude. Oh my God. Now go outside and
touch some grass yourself."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snX5YyflrGw,"100 Identical Twins Fight For $250,000",2139,20240928,en,"Behind me are 100 sets of twins, and
they're going to compete for $250,000. Everyone go to your cube. Out of these 100 pairs of identical twins, only one is walking away with
this quarter of a million dollars. And if either twin crosses the
red line, they’ll both be eliminated. Let's find out which of you is the best
set of twins and wins the 250 grand. I have never been around
this many sets of twins before. Everyone looks
so similar, it's crazy In school. Did you
ever go to class for him? I took a test for him. Really? I'm putting that in. Right there, the pot of money.
I could get used to that view. We got this. We got this. But little do they know, this video is going to put
their bond as twins to the test. Shut up. Let's go. I feel sick to my stomach. I’m so sorry I’m not gonna
forgive you for that I don’t trust you You’ll have to drag
us out by our hair! Attention, everybody, Every challenge in
this video is designed so that you and your twin
must work together to pass. In the first challenge, this room
is going to flash a series of colors. You and your twin must work together
to memorize the order of the colors and enter them on your tablet. If you enter them
correctly, you stay in, if you enter the colors
incorrectly you're eliminated. Oh gosh I’m low key scared I'm gonna start you off easy. For the
first round, the pattern is six colors. Blue, Yellow,
Green, Yellow, Blue, Blue. Enter the order you
saw them into your tablet. Blue, Yellow, Green.
Yellow. Blue. Blue. What's interesting is some cubes are actually
sharing information with each other. I think we got it. Did you get it? Lock it in. If it's wrong, it's
wrong. I love you. Love you too. Three pairs of twins entered the sequence
incorrectly. Light their cubes Red. And fun fact, the three pairs that got eliminated
were all right beside each other. Everyone cheer
them on as they leave. We salute you. This next sequence is 15 colors. And if you think this is hard,
we're just getting started. This is getting to be too much. We kept adding more and more
colors to the pattern every round. Yellow, Green I’m going to see
if I can remember them. Blue, Yellow, Green I already forgot it. Oh, this is bad. Let's just
see who got eliminated. No! She placed third in our
ages one through 100 Video, and then in this
video, you place 93rd. I messed it up. My heart is absolutely
racing right now. And yeah, 15 colors
might be pretty hard, but not even close to the
27 colors we got too later. Did it end on green? No it ended on yellow It ended on yellow. You
completely messed up! You're not listening. Why would I listen to you? Help! Help me, help me! Push Submit!
Wait it wasn't right! All right, everyone has voted and in our final round, 12
pairs of twins were eliminated. This is everyone that was eliminated.
We gave each pair of twins $1,000. And that concludes challenge
number one, 72 pairs of you now remain. I told you I’m right! Winners! Winn-ers! Mr Beast. This is the Olympics, and that's my gold
medal. I need to pay off my student debt Calling it Derting
twins, top two. Top two. And like always, we destroyed
all of the eliminated players cubes. Karl, that's how
you do it, right there. Are you all ready
for challenge two? Bring out the second challenge! Pay very close attention, this
is where things get interesting. Half of you are going to be
eliminated in this challenge. Yes, it's going
to be cutthroat. Wow. Everyone pull the
curtain off of the blocks. Feastables? They’re Feastables cubes.
We’re stacking something. One of you in your cube is
going to put on a blindfold, the other is going
to hold this tray. The twin who's wearing the blindfold
has to stack all ten cubes on the tray. The twin holding the tray will have to move
the completed tower down on the podium. But if you drop even
one of the cubes, I don't got it! You and your twin
are both eliminated. Do you want to hold it or stack? I'll hold it. I'll stack You stack. Half of us are going home. And last thing I
need to mention, you'll be competing
against your neighbor, and only one set of
twins will be moving on. No! No! It’s either one of us, Bruh I’m sick! We'll start with this section of
cubes. Three. Two. One. Begin. Reach out, reach out, reach
out go to the left. Go to the left. Get to stacking! Down, there you go. Because the twin who's blindfolded
will be doing all of the stacking, this game completely relies
on your communication as twins. Your opponents already
have four stacked. Oh God Gentle, bring it down slowly. Perfect. It's perfect. Oh, no. You guys need to hurry. Bro, hey, your opponent's
about to stack their final two cubes - Where?
- Higher, way high. No no no. Luke I need you to hold. I can't really help you. But completing the tower of
ten cubes is only the beginning. The hardest part is moving
the finished tower to the podium. Dude. They’re wobbling a lot This is the most important
moment of his life. Oh no! Oh, they
dropped it. You guys won. Yeah! And remember if the tower somehow falls
and touches the twin holding the cubes, that also counts as a fall
and both of you are eliminated. Oh, no. Oh! Oh great! But with some of the other
twins, we saw a different strategy. Some chose to not even touch
their cubes or attempt their tower, and bet it all on their
opponents tower falling. They're going to drop
it. They’re gonna drop it. How many blocks are they
at? Have they even got one. No. Are they just
going to sit there? Yeah, they're going to sit there. 
They're corner camping. But just waiting for their opponent
to fail wasn't the only tactic we saw. You got it! This is an interesting strategy Go girl go! Haha okay. They're trying to distract their
opponents and make their tower fall over. You’re going down! Well you're going to lose.
Your voice is going down! But they're being so loud that the twins all the way across
the room can even hear them. What's the strategy? I don't know
even know, is yelling a strategy? I don't know what you have to do
to stay in, but do not lose to them. What is happening? All right, ten minutes
left for this round, whichever team has the
most blocks when it hits zero. Whoever gets the
most blocks, come on. When the Collins twins realized
they were running out of time, they quickly began stacking and they were able to tie it
up at five cubes in each tower. How many are they at? They at Five. Jay, it’s shaking a lot. I think
we buzzer beat this thing. Less than 20 seconds
left for this round. Wait, I can grab another block.
Do we need another block? Go straight. Are you going to go for the win? Yeah, we are Hurry hurry!
Straight... to the left. Ten, [Continues on in
background - Nine, Eight] All right, come, come
here. Drop it six inches. Seven, Six, Five, Four Here up, stop, be still! Two, One Drop! It touched his nose. 
He accidentally touched it. - Oh my God! You guys won!
- Yes! Yes! No! No way. You’re gonna have to
drag us out by our hair! But these games were only getting
more intense as the challenge went on. Oh no! adjust the... Oh, it fell! Oh, no. During this challenge, we got to see which
team had the strongest twin telepathy. Right, come that,
yeah right there Bro just directed him with his
head as if he could see him. - It's a twin thing.
- It’s a twin thing. But the way some of these
other pairs were communicating, you could hardly
believe that they're twins. Dude keep it still. Keep
it still. Lift it up. You're... Oh, he almost hit your head. Bro for twins, we are
not coordinated, bro. And in our final round, we had two games
that went down to the very last second. Two, one. Hands
off! Oh, no! Tower fell You won! Their stack fell over,
you guys won! Yeah! They are now one step closer
to a quarter of a million dollars. And as promised, half of you
were eliminated in that challenge. We're wheeling
in some bunk beds. Get some sleep because the
challenges tomorrow will be way harder. That last challenge
was like, so difficult The Morrises, we've kind of worked together
and have had a really strong alliance. So right now it's the two of us
left and we're all in it together, What do you think
how does it feel? kinda feels like heaven Alright goodnight Final 36 baby! - Goodnight! 
- Sleep well! And after the
bloodbath of the first day, the twins were a lot more
optimistic than I thought they’d be We’re going to win this
challenge. 100,000%. We're ready. We're locked in. Good morning everybody! Guards! Bring out the next challenge. Remove the black cloth on the
podium we put outside your cube. This next game is
going to test your greed. As you can see, each of
you has $5,000 in front of you. It's completely up to you
whether or not you take the money. And if you do take it, there is a 50-50 chance you'll be
randomly selected to be eliminated. But if you don't take it, you
are guaranteed to move on. We're going to throw
up a ten minute timer. Play it safe and move on,
or gamble 250 grand for five. The choice is completely yours. Why don't we just
take the money? Five grand isn't enough
for us to toss our chances. Whatcha doing? Well, this is guaranteed. This is guaranteed, but
you might get eliminated. It's not much. It's a free five grand. I know, but we decided we
want to trust the twin-tuition We came here to win big bucks. The stress from this decision was
creating tension between some of the twins. I say we leave the money. You get too uptight. No no no don’t, I'm
trying to talk to you. I want to walk away with
something like I need the money No, that is what our
eyes are on, not that. You guys officially
have $5,000. Congrats. You don't care
about this five grand? No. We just want to win the
MrBeast challenge because We want bragging rights!
Remember this face, baby! Bad Beast Barbies! And in the final moments, the last few
twins scrambled to make their decision. Take the money bro! All right. Put that on my shoulder boy! I always like to ask myself,
what would Jimmy do? I think that Jimmy would take
the money... and say, nahhhhh! Because eight contestants
have taken the money, that means we will be randomly
eliminating four of them right now. And to ensure its random, we're
picking their names out of this machine. Grab a random name, and
the first elimination is Allen. We got bread though! Can you carry me out? Sure. Allen twins come up to the
stage, you can pull the next name. The next elimination is Moore. No! Our greed got the best of us And once again, the eliminated
twins will be pulling the next name. And the next set of twins
to go are the Miller Twins. If we didn't take it, we'd
still be in the cube for 250. That's life changing money
for us, so I 100% regret it. And the final set
of twins eliminated. The DeAngelo twins
are our final elimination. We got a guaranteed five K? I felt
like it was the best choice to make. You just got to take
what you can get. Bye guys, good luck! And with that
challenge four is over. I'm glad I didn’t take it! So far in this video, it's been you
and your twins deciding your fate. But for this next challenge, you all as a group will decide
if people go or people stay. Two buttons are going
to pop up on your tablet. If you press the green button,
you're voting to end the challenge. And if all of you press
green, this challenge is over. If you press the red button,
you can vote someone out. Whoever gets the most
votes will be eliminated or nobody has to go home if you
all work together and vote green, you have five minutes to make a decision. Personally, I find it very
rude to vote people out. Being a twin is all
about teamwork. Green! Vote green! Like I said, if they all voted
green, they would all move on. But since the Collins twins have
made such a name for themselves. You’re going down! It didn't seem like that
was going to happen. Hey, boys. I think we know
what to do. Stacey and Tracy Taking justice
into our own hands. Word spread quickly and
after just a few twins voted red, it started a chain reaction which made
it clear that someone was going home. Stacey and Tracy Stacey and Tracy. Tracy, Stacey. Who’s the biggest threat here? 
Who has personality? Who works hard? 
Who’s won every challenge? Time is up. You guys
think everyone hit green? No. Literally no one thinks that. Okay. Only two pairs of twins received votes.
And the Haley twins received one vote. Bye boo And the Collins twins... received 26 votes. Oh, my God. That’s a lot of
votes for Collins They’re scared! Wait we didn’t vote for us. They’re scared! The witch is dead. Alright thank y'all.
We had a good time. I've never seen this many
people work together on anything. It's a lot quieter
without them now. And now that the common
enemy had been obliterated. One and done. One and done. Everyone decided to vote green. Timer has hit zero.
Everybody hit the green button. Yeah! I’m gonna to go set
up the next challenge. That was wild. We all could of
turned on each other. I'd rather people go out on their own terms. Yeah, instead of people
just choosing who goes out. 31 sets of twins remain, but we're about
to give you your hardest challenge yet. By the end of it, we will be
in the top ten sets of twins. Oh, God. Randomly over the next few hours, the lights in this room
will turn red like this. And when that happens, the first pair
of twins to tap the button on their tablet, is safe and moves on. But anyone else who
attempted to press the button and wasn’t first
will be eliminated. We're doing this ten times,
and it's up to you to decide which round you press the button. Ideally, all 30 of you don't try
to press the button the first time Because the more people who attempt
each round, the worse your chances are. We’re going to go second, and we
made that point clear to everyone in here. What are you
guys doing, first? We’re going on one baby! I think most people
are gonna go off the bat. I have a pretty
good reaction time. What's the strategy here? We're going for
alarm number two. We're gonna like announce it to everyone. If you don't want to get
eliminated, don't go two. But not everyone was
confident with going early. I will say you're very far away
from pressing a button right now. Going first is never the answer. Okay. All right everybody, the
challenge has officially started. Good luck The moment it
turns red just... Dude, I'm telling you right
now, I got this in the bag As soon as that
light dims, boom - Should I yell Red?
- Oh my gosh It could literally
happen any second now. Oh, God, I'm so
scared. I'm so scared. Oh my gosh. That was the first one. Yeah baby! Oh my God. It looks like four pairs of
you attempted round one. Let's see who tapped the button first, and
which three pairs of you are going home. I don’t usually hold hands like I know we don't
usually hold hands. So you guys, either
just got eliminated - Or we won.
- Or are moving on the top ten? Yes You pressed it? Yeah man! A bunch of other people pressed it, we
got to see who actually pressed it first. We made it through four challenges. Whatever happens, we
should be proud of ourselves. Reveal the results Oh my God. But before the twins
had even a minute to relax We got this in the bag We decided to surprise
them with another round. The alarm went off Did it? Yes, its red. And once again, only four
pairs of you attempted round two. You did it? Yeah, I did it so fast. Reveal the result and by
less than a 10th of a second The Cliffords won round two. Let’s get it! No! Dang! I'm so proud of y'all. Now we're watching
y'all. Y'all gotta make it too! Wish us luck! If you did not win,
you can step out. Bye! See ya guys. Two sets of twins have
secured their spots in the top ten. How many of you are
going to go for the next one? You think we go here? Yeah. Maybe you just wait. Stop looking away. Maybe on the 10th press,
there's only one of you. Focus! His finger are far
from the screen. You keep looking away. I
can tell you're daydreaming. Alright! I don’t know if I got that. I did it quick, I don’t
know if it was fast enough. For round three, three pairs
of you pressed the button. Before we reveal the result, we're bringing
all of you the world's best chocolate. We need to cheer you guys
up, you seem way to nervous. - Feastables! 
- I’d love some chocolate! - We love Feastables!
- You want some chocolate? Oh, duh! The boys are currently handing
everyone Feastable chocolate bars AKA the best chocolate on the planet. Feastables baby! And I’m excited to announce we just launched our brand new
cookies and creme Feastables bar. Cookies and creme? It’s my favorite. Cookies and creme! Cookies and creme, please! You want another one? Yeah! You want another one? Yeah! You want another? I'm probably biased, but this is literally the best
chocolate I've ever had in my life. Feastables Cookies and creme
is out now, but we didn't stop there. We also launched our brand
new Halloween Multi-pack because this year
on Halloween night Feastables is going to give
someone a million dollars. If you don't hand out
Feastables at Halloween this year, clearly you hate
your neighborhood. And now for the results of round three, which to be honest, is pretty ironic,
the Hershey Twins are the winner. Oh my. I’m not going to
forgive you for that. Sixteen more of you to go and there's only seven slots. Technically, your odds have improved by
waiting, but there's still
a lot of you left. Can you tell people
we're going for four? You got this. You wanna just do it? So scared. I don’t
wanna know if it turns red. I felt really good about that. Round four's winner
is the Beatty twins. Let’s go! I thought we had it. Sorry it didn’t work out. No distractions. You got this dude. Round five is Leiva. You guys
want to step out together? Brutal. The Narvaez twins! The Morris twins! Seven sets of twins remain,
but only three spots are left. I’m getting down
right now. Okay? Lock in. It’s gonna
happen any second. Is Fischer doing it? Don't talk. Yes. It’s just us and Fischer. Just
breathe. Another team is doing it. Who? It’s the ones up there. 
Get off, get off. Badgett’s have their
hand off right now. Who? The boys? Yeah. You have two other competitors. Should I go ahead for it? Yeah, get ready. Alright, they’re
back so lock in. Are the ones at
the top locked in? Stop asking No! No! I did, I did it already. I was quick. You did it fast. And the winner of round eight is the Badgett twins. and after that, round nine's
winner was the Derting twins. And round ten was
the Rosenbergs. And that concludes this challenge. Congratulations to
making it to the top ten. Yeah! Still top 10 baby. Top 10 baby, lets go! Make sure you sleep well
tonight, because tomorrow one pair of you is winning
that quarter of $1 million. I'll see you then. We did it together. That’s what we’re taking home. We’re locked in.
We’re ready to go. Tomorrow, I don’t
know what to expect. We’re so psyched. Hey goodnight. Goodnight. Goodnight. Goodnight top ten. Sleep well. Good morning everybody. For this next challenge, we will be dwindling you down
to the final five pairs of twins. Each pair of twins will be
facing another pair of twins in a comically large game of
bowling, each with a 105 pins. We got this challenge
in the bag, baby. And to make it even
more interesting, the twin that is the
bowler will be blindfolded. That changes things And the other one will have
to guide you where to bowl. I'm not worried about it. We're going to beat whoever. Since you won the first
round of the button game. Simone Biles We’re going to let you pick who you
go up against. Have fun strategizing. We don’t go bowling a
lot but I think I should bowl. You guys good bowlers? Not really. I suck. Rosenbergs,
they’re like a bit older. They got glasses. They’re
probably great bowlers. We just got to give it our all. And while they’re strategizing, I want
to tell you about our brand new product, Lunchly, which pairs Feastables and Prime together
in a better for you version of Lunchables. Lunchly comes in
three flavors. Fiesta Nachos, Turkey
Stack ‘ems, and The Pizza. And inside each box is a miniature
Prime and a miniature Feastables. Let’s go see what the twins
think of them. How’s it going? Oh. We got pizza, turkey, nachos.
Whichever one you want. - I’ll get the pizza. 
- The nachos look so good. And that is real cheese. Oh, these are fire. Yummy. Delicious.
Better than Lunchables. - You guys hungry?
- Oh, yeah. Each meal comes with a tiny Feastables
bar. Their last name is Hershey’s. That might be some of the
best chocolate I’ve ever had and that’s saying something
because we’re Hershey’s. And Lunchly is only around $5. I can't wait to see what you guys
think and up first, the Sansone twins. Am I the bowler or
are you the bowler? I don’t care, I’ll do it. You can step out. Promise? Yes, I promise you will not be
eliminated. Follow me over here. How does it feel to
be outside the cube? This is so weird. So this is your bowling lane and now you
must pick one other cube to go up against. Bro, this is crazy. Who you face is up to you. Pick us. Just pick us. You won’t. I’m not picking you. - Sorry. No.
- No. You gotta remember,
it’s blindfolded bowling. So it’s not all about strength.
It’s also about strategy. Okay, we’re going to
pick the Hershey twins. Let’s go. Whichever pair of twins knocks down the
most pins with three bowls, will move on. The other pair will be eliminated. Okay, ready? 
Go this way. Three. Two. One. Go! Good, good, good,
good. Good job. Wow. Oh my gosh. That’s really bad. Okay. What do you want me to do? Not that much force
for both of them. Netiher one of us put
enough on that first one. Blindfold up.
Let’s do round two. Yes. Just like that.
You got it. - Two. One. Go.
- Straight. You got it. I don’t even know. I am
stressing out right now. The Hershey’s twins knocked out 48 pins
and the Sansone twins knocked down 37. They are 11 behind with one bowl remaining. Get mad. Are you mad? Yes. Act like it. $250,000 on the line. Let’s see if they clutch up. Three. Two. One. Go! - Great job. 
- Oh my God. Great job. I actually have no
idea who won now. Oh my god. The Hershey's
messed up big time. That might have been the
comeback of the century. That hurt. The Hershey twins
knocked down 55 pins. The Sansone twins knocked
down 79 and are moving on. Yeah! Oh my gosh. Who do you want to go next? Pick us, pick us. We’re going to pick
the Beatty twins. Alright, you two can
head back to your cubes. Thank you. Who do you think you
want to go against? I think those two kids up there. Alright, we’ll pick them. Narvaez twins, I’m
coming to get you. Godspeed. Godspeed. Twins, are you ready? Yes. Yep. Three. Two. One. Go! Let's go. I will take it. Alright, blindfold up. Go. They’re off. Oh, that might have
been a comeback. Y'all chose us. Y'all chose us. Man, that’s a lot
of pins down dude. $250,000 on the line. Get your twins in position. Three. Two, one. Go! The last bowls. Oh my gosh. No! 89 pins knocked down, to 74, sorry gentleman. GG’s boys. Who do you want to go next? These guys. Knowing that only five pairs
of twins were moving on, they all chose their
opponents carefully. I think we’re going to
go with the Badgett’s. Oh my gosh. The blindfolds are on. Go! Right down the middle. Oh. I’m so sorry. Alright, who’s next? - Leiva’s.
- Leiva’s. All right. The Clifford's. You can exit your cube. Three. Two. One. Go! It was becoming clear who is
the biggest threat in this challenge. I used to be in a league. I’m friends with a lot of
people who are in a league. Bowling is a strength. Do you guys think
you're a fierce competitor? I'm not too worried. And the final two sets
of twins, come on down. Let’s see which
one will move on. Alright gentlemen,
put your blindfolds on. $250,000 on the line. I’m so glad we didn’t have
to go against either of them. Three. Two. One. Go! Oh, my gosh. Dude, those are
both very good. Great bowl. Okay, okay. Those are our best ones yet. You can definitely tell
they both have experience. It is neck and neck. This had to be the match up. Oh, yeah. Let's see if that changes. Three two. One Go! Oh, the ricochet. Woah, I don’t know. Dude, they barely
have any pins left. The last bowl of the challenge, one of these twins
are about to go home and one’s going to top five. Three. Two. One. Go! Oh my gosh. They might have made a comeback. That was a good ball though. That’s
the best play you could have had there. I think that’s good enough. Oh my gosh. Wow. This is going
to be a close game. And the final tally is 82
pins knocked down... to 86. Yes! Yes! Yes! Oh my goodness. Congrats on making it to the
final five. We have the Beatty twins. Gotta do what
you gotta do, right? Top five baby. The Clifford twins. Let's go! The Derting twins. We're freaking out. The Sansone twins. And the Morris twins. The bowling champ right here. Now we’ll be going head to
head in one final challenge for this quarter of $1 million. Good luck to everybody. You ready for the
final challenge? - Yeah.
- Yeah. A little bit of nerves, but I mean
we’re happy we made it this far. Oh, we’re stoked. So if you won, what are you
going to spend the money on? We're going to go to Japan. Japan and school. We talked about investing. Buy my parents a new house. Really? Probably not. Going to put it like all in our brand
and you’re going to make us rich, famous rockstars. - Oh, really?
- Yeah. My parents. I mean, they
have three kids in college, and they’re trying
to help us through so it would mean the world
if we could help them out and then I’ll probably
buy a new fishing rod. - Good luck in this next challenge. 
- Thank you. Thank you. I appreciate it. - Thank you!
- Thank you! I appreciate it, Jimmy. At the start of this challenge,
we had a hundred cubes and now we’re down to five. Congrats on making it this far. But up to this point we’ve still not
determined who the best set of twins is. So for the grand finale, you may
exit your cubes and come down here. The final challenge will
be right here in the middle. This is terrifying. I’m excited for any
of you guys to win this. Bring out the podiums. - Oh my God.
- What? This is so scary. If you’ve seen our
50 YouTubers video, this probably
looks a little familiar. At the beginning of each round,
everyone will start off blindfolded. Meanwhile, I will be
shuffling these five briefcases. Now the left side of you
may take off your blindfold. Which briefcase do you want? Can I just pick it up? Yeah, just pick it up. Put it on your podium. Four of these
briefcases are empty, while one of them holds the check for
the grand prize of a quarter of $1 million. All five of them have now
looked inside their briefcase, and only they
know what's in there. The players without briefcases, will cast a vote to eliminate
one set of twins from the game. The contestants with the most votes
must reveal what’s inside the briefcase and if their case is
empty, they’re eliminated. But if their case has a
check for $250,000 inside. You’ll never believe this, but that pair of
twins wins the grand prize of $250,000. If twin telepathy was a thing,
now would be the time to use it. Throw up a ten minute timer.
Everyone decide who you're voting for. Hey Morris at the
end. Do you have it? I might. He’s shaking a little. I don't think he has it. Do you think you have a good understanding
of what your brother's thinking? I think so. Does anyone want to admit they have the
$250,000? Oh, so you’re
saying you have it. I have it. That’s bold. That’s some
Beatty stuff right there. I don’t know, why would he would
just say he has the money, though? Yeah. That’s so sus. Who are you voting for?
Are you voting for your brother? I don't know. Toss me the vote.
Toss me the vote. How well can you read your
counterpart? You guys grew up together. Vote for me. Dude, stop. Just stop talking
because you’re freaking me out. 45 seconds. I think we should vote him out
because I don’t think they have it. I don’t think he has it
either. I’m going to be honest. What if they do have it? You’re going to have
to start writing soon. I’m just writing who
I’m confident for. Five, four, three, two, one. Alright, Karl, gather their votes. Feel good about this? I don't know. The first vote was for Clifford. The second vote was Morris. The third vote was Sansone. Oh, we have one vote for
three separate pairs of twins. The fourth vote was for Beatty. The fifth and final
vote... is Beatty, which means they received two
and will be opening their briefcase. Oh my God. No way dude. I have it, yeah. No! It's empty! Wait,
did you vote for him? I voted for him. You voted for your own brother. The Beatty twin with the briefcase
almost executed the perfect bluff. That is until his own brother
couldn’t even read his poker face. Could’ve just kept
your mouth shut. Don't worry though boys,
you're not leaving empty handed. - Appreciate you man. 
- Hey, good luck! Bye guys. With that, I need all of
you to put on the blindfolds and we’re going to
reshuffle the briefcases. Now, the opposite side will be
picking briefcases this go-around. Joe watch people’s body
language as they open it. Yeah. Would you like briefcase
number one, two, three or four? Three. Alright, third briefcase. Oh. Give me two. I'll put it on your podium.
How about you? one or two? One. Here you go. Morris, that
leaves you with the final briefcase. Now, only the people with the
briefcase may remove their blindfolds. Look at what’s
inside your briefcase. Only they know what’s in there. Alright, I need all of
you to close it now. You may take
off your blindfolds. Start the ten minute timer.
Let’s see how this goes. Do you have it? I might have it. Do you have it? I don't have the money now. What about y’all down there? Don’t have it. So nobody here has it. That's just factually not true. Somebody has it. I don’t think the
Sansone’s have it. I agree with you. I feel like you’re all
being sus, so I can’t really- Well duh. I think the Morrises have it and I already
placed my vote on who I want to get rid of. I think Clifford’s
have the money. If you’re making a decision now,
that means you have the money. That's what you think, bro. I’m voting for Morris. I think Morris has the money. I’m telling you, they
got the money, bro. I'm sorry. I love you all. Three. Two. One. Time is up. Oh my God. Oh my gosh. The first vote is for Morris. The second vote is also for Morris. I'm so nervous. Did you listen to me? 
Did you listen to me? The third vote is for Derting. If Derting and gets
another vote, it’s a tie. If not, the Morris twins will
be opening their briefcase. The final vote is Derting. We have a tie. You guys have three
minutes to decide. The four of you recast votes either
for Derting or Morris to break the tie. Wait. So who should I vote for? He looks so stressed. Is he fake stressing? The Morrises have the money. Vote Derting
if you want to continue is what I’m saying. Don't put my name down. You see, like they’re trying
to, like, save theirself now, that’s what I’m saying
just listen to the boy like.. Crystal, what do you think? I don’t know. Ten seconds. If you want to make the top
three, you just put their name down. Trust me. Trust me,
trust me. Trust me. -Four.
- Or maybe they’re lying. Three. Trust me, bro, trust me. One. Hands down. I hate to do it bro. Let’s tally these votes. Morris or Derting one of
you is opening your briefcase. Our first vote is for Derting. Our second vote is also for Derting. The third vote is for Derting. The fourth vote, which is
now irrelevant, is also Derting. Four? All four of them voted
for the Derting twins. Bro. Reveal what is
in your briefcase. Fourth place,
baby. Fourth place. Told you. Oh my God. You’re also going
home with $10,000. - That’s awesome!
- There you go. And now that all of you at
home know how this game works, for this next round, we’re not even
gonna reveal who has the money. You want one, two or three? I’ll do two. I’ll do one. Karl give Morris the last one. The three of you with
briefcases, take your blindfolds off. Look inside your briefcase. Alright, close them. You guys may take off your
blindfolds. Start the timer. I think I have an
idea of who has it. And who’s that? Wait, you think they have it? Again. What if you had it, though? She looks nervous. That’s all. I mean I’ve been nervous. I’m telling you,
they got that. So then what? Do you
want to be voted out? Hey, you saying they have the money means
their only option is to vote for you. Do you have the money? Do you want to come look? John. YOU DON'T HAVE IT? $250,000 on the line. You got 47 seconds. One of you is
going to be walking away with the money. Okay. Who do you think? I feel like Clifford
has the money. Clifford, you guys have
been right in the past two. You make up your
mind I’ll vote for whoever. I’ve got the suitcase, but I can’t
help everyone vote every round, like- 15 seconds. I'd start writing. Give me something. I know what I’m doing. Okay. She knows
what she's doing. Do you have it in your
suitcase? Yes or no? I might have it in my suitcase. He’s lying. How am I lying? I don’t know, I don’t
know, I don’t know. Five. Four. Three. Two. One. Pens down. The first vote is for Morris. The second vote... is also Morris. We don’t even need to
see what the third one is. Bring the table on over. Good luck guys. All right, Morrises, it all
comes down to this moment. You do not know
what’s inside of here. Alright, you want to show him? If it’s empty. They lose. And the game continues
until there’s a winner. But if it has
$250,000, it’s theirs. Ah, you got it! Yes, yes, yes. Good job, bro. I’m gonna cry. It’s okay. What are you guys going
to spend the money on? It's going to our family. I mean, they
work so hard for us. I couldn't be happier. Pull it apart. That is your $125,000
and that is his $125,000. Dude. Congrats. And, dude, I can't believe it."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRcUVhVlSHg,"Men Vs Women Survive In The Wilderness For $500,000",1907,20240907,en,"I just dropped off five men and five
women in the middle of the wilderness. And whichever group survives
the longest wins that five hundred grand. I give you all three days. That money is all ours! That is your side of the woods,
and that is your side of the woods. And you are not at any point
allowed to cross sides or you'll be disqualified. You should go start prepping
for your first night. - We out!
- May the odds be ever in your favor. Men or women, let's see who wins. There's no way the girls are beating us. They're not five men. - How do you think the guys are doing?
- Terrible! They probably stopped by now. We're not going to survive,
we're going to thrive. As long as we're good
at being a little hungry. We'll be fine. Oh, we got strawberries. What? Anything that's around
here is on our food list. I'm already seeing a shelter
in my head. There it is. - This will be our shelter.
- Welcome home brothers! And miles away on the other side, the girls found a spot
to set up their camp. The water looks pretty bad
right here, so I'm hoping we can follow it back and maybe find a clean source
to gather from. This is nice. Yeah, this might be the spot
you guys. Things might be going smooth now, but this challenge will become the
most brutal one that I've ever filmed. If I left now, I would regret it. It's so hard out here. I just heard some move in there, bro. I don't think we're alone out here. Okay, let's check what supplies we have. - Fruit.
- Granola. Sausage. Dude, you got all the meat. I also gave each of them
a full water bottle and some key survival gear. That's not a lot of food. We're gonna have to figure out how
long we want to stretch this. Attention! Can all of you hear me? - We hear you loud and clear.
- We're all here. - We hear you loud and clear.
- We're all here. I just want to make sure
we're all on the same page on how this challenge works.
To make things more interesting. If a person leaves this challenge, they
can still get their share of the money. The only thing that matters is
which team has the last player left. - What?
- We were not expecting that. No one ever does. It's up to each of you to decide
whether you stay to help your teammates,
or leave to save them food. Also, for this entire challenge,
you will never know how many men are still left on their side,
and the men will have no idea how many women are left
on your side. It's a game of strategy.
This will be fun. That food goes a lot further
for like two people than five. Are we really only going to be able
to sustain 1 or 2 people We’ll cross that bridge when we get there. If anybody does quit,
I do not hold it against you. - I will 100% holding it against you.
- Yeah. For sure. Come on bro. Hey, after that first week,
I think its strategy though, - We got to strategize.
- One hundred percent. Hey, we're a team bro. - We're making it.
- We're staying. Girls rule, boys drool. For the rest of the night. Both camps began constructing their shelters
to prepare for any upcoming storms, and the guys built theirs
out of the first twigs they found. We have the whole teepee built
and everything. The girls are not doing that. Actually, they are. And they're doing it
way better than the boys. - And, up!
- We got it. I'm going to try and get a fire prepped. Bet we beat the guys in that. - There we go.
- There we go. Let's go. What a Freakin start of a journey, boys. Night number one was kind of rough. It took me a long time
to go to sleep. Good morning. We need more walls
for the teepee still. Let's get making our house. I think the girls are doing
way better than the boys right now. We are going through the woods
because we need water. And to get clean water. The boys had to travel miles
to undrinkable, filthy swamp. I hope the girls have to go
through something like this. I'm not going to lie. You can't see anything
in this water. I do not want to drink swamp water. Well over a mile and a half.
Two mile walk. It's day two. And after hours of searching, the boys
finally found their water source. We made it. Finally. By day three, the women were already
strategizing to self eliminate some of their teammates
to help preserve their food supply. If we as a team want to win this,
diving into this, it's not sustainable
even for two people. I would like to have two people here
at least until the end. I would agree. And it was very clear
to the whole team who those two girls would be. Phaedra and Julia are our survival mommies,
and so we kind of are at their beck and call to help
and do whatever we need. The boys, on the other hand,
had absolutely no clue whatsoever. We are definitely not rationing it like, no, there's no talking
strategy amongst us. Five people is a lot of people eating
of that food stash. We can't last to the end
with five people. Day four Josh and I were talking
about us having to be the providers. While they are the entertainers. TJ and I were carrying the weight. Just been building, building,
building, building for the team. And there's those three still
sitting around the fire doing nothing. They just want to be served. Josh are you gonna tell
us the food was done? - Yeah.
- When? Did you know the food was done? - No.
- I know I’m not the only one! Hey, I thought so, silence. By this point, the boys weren't even a week into the
challenge and were already teaming up against one of their own. I will directly say to Josh, it looks like you're
chillin all day, and then we're burning Gods amounts of energy day in and day out. And that hurt a lot. I mean, if anything past burning
these calories that he's so tired about doing backflips and showing
off in front of the camera. So it made me contemplate today whether I really want to do this
anymore. While tension was making
some of the men consider leaving. The girls were ready to do the same,
but only as part of the strategy. - This food load might have to change.
- It can't change. We're still not
getting into rations. It is time to start as a team, sending
people home for the goal of winning. It can't be more than two people
touching the rations. So we have as a team decided
that it's time for me to go home. This is Hannah,
and I'm ready to leave. We will discreetly evacuate you out
of the forest without alerting the boys. Let's do it with a discreet
monster truck. We're about to pull up on their camp
for the first elimination. I'm going to step away
as a team strategy. It makes sense. More food
for the other four. Let's get you out of here. I want you winning okay? You did so good! If the women end up winning. You're the smartest one here. You're the first out,
but you'll get 100 grand. A lot of people said “look
I would have just left”. Well, Hannah can consider herself
lucky because for the next two days, intense rainstorms
forced both of the teams to stay in their shelters
and survive solely on their rations. We definitely can't live off
this food for much longer. So come day ten,
I decided to throw in a twist. And if you've ever seen one
of my videos, you know what that means. It's time for a challenge. But to make it even more intense
in this video, every ten days the boys and girls are going
to have to face each other. And we're gonna kick things off
by visiting the girls. Hi. It's day ten.
What do you think that means? You're going to give us some
great news? Depends. I need you to pick a leader
and face one of the boys for a potential prize. I'll meet you at the bridge
in an hour, whoever you pick. This is where we take the video
up a notch. We choose Phaedra. Let's go see how the boys are doing. Welcome to the men's camp. You guys look so official. I need you guys to elect a leader
that in one hour will meet me at the bridge. Unanimously, Killer p Man, I’m feeling extremely confident. Inside I feel a little scared. Come on in.
These walks are so dramatic. Congratulations on surviving
ten days. How's it going? Really well, actually. And remember, they have no idea how many people are still left
from the opposing team. How many women do you think
are still in? There's three. - How many men do you think are left?
- I'm going to say three too. The funny thing is,
both of them are completely wrong and neither will know the truth
until one team wins it all. This challenge is simple. You're going to take turns
firing at that target. And hanging from beneath a target
is a bag full of perishable food. If you hit the target,
it'll drop it. But if you miss,
move it to the other side. She will then get an opportunity
to try to win it. I'm so good at archery. I'm definitely second
guessing this decision of sending Patrick and not me. - Oh Phaedra is gonna kill it.
- Absolutely. Whatever it lands on fires first. Not in the water! - Men!
- Okay. Fire away. Shot number one.
We're out of here. - Have you ever shot an arrow before?
- I have not. Oh. All right. I feel like I'm
watching the Super Bowl. - Yeah.
- First time shooting an arrow? First time shooting an arrow. - Bro, what happens?
- Swing and a miss! Move the target to the other side. Let's see if the women's
team can make it. Whoa! She's taking the jacket off. Oh, it's go time. Phaedra, your team desperately
needs those rations. Will you be the one to bring them
home? She got it! - Yeah!
- Let's go! No way! Dude, that was like watching
the Hunger Games. All right, let's go grab it. - Cheers to victory!
- Cheers! Cut to a shot of the boys. They're struggling. Let's go, let's go. So y'all also need to
eat a lot and quickly. I've noticed you keep saying y'all. So. Wait what? We had to dip into our rations
after the rain. And look at this.
This is primarily perishable. So although it adds for a while,
it's not going to add long term. And so we had the conversation
I would go. - You think about leaving right now.
- Yes. Conveniently I'm already here - if you just want to hitch a ride back?
- Yeah. Now. And so with a toast of Feastables
and hugs to say goodbye. Bye Divas! We'll see you on the outside. The women's team
was down to just three survivors, while the men's team
still had all five. I know we can win this
entire challenge for her. - I do too.
- And Hannah. With plenty of food and one
less person to split it with. The girls morale was through
the roof. I'm feeling really good,
really optimistic. We've been really pushing ourselves
hard. So to have
this meal is going to mean a lot. Cheers, guys. Delicious. However, losing the challenge
took a real toll on TJ. I'm beating myself up pretty badly
about the archery competition. Everyone thought
it should have been me. Unanimously. - Killer P.
- Killer P! I should have
stepped up when I had the chance. When I was sitting on that chair
and I saw the bows and arrows. I just thought it should have been me. The next challenge will be me. The girls enjoyed their abundance
of food for the next few days. Cheers. The boys unfortunately
had to still catch their fish. Let's go babe. No. No way. With the rations running dangerously
low at this point, the boys team was starting to become
hopeless. Bro Cam, I'm so glad
that I got you here, bro. I know I may seem sluggish,
and stuff, but this is all mental. Like I have nothing in me. The pressure had really started
to get to Cameron, and while Sami tried
to lift his spirits a little. But the morning of day 13,
he had already made up his mind. The sleep deprivation has taken its toll. - I just hit my breaking point.
- I'm proud of you, bro. Hold it down man. - I appreciate the journey, man.
- Bye Cam! That was a big bummer. - Losing Cam today.
- How's today for a dark day? But the boys weren't
the only ones taking a loss. Today is Talia's day. We're going to miss her very much. We are. While the girls were leaving strategically
with half $1 million in mind, the boys, on the other hand,
were leaving from the difficulties. I'm so defeated. I'm grateful for this. It's just. This is freakin tough. Just had a break down, bro. Do you think you can make it
to the next challenge? Oh, no.
It's about to break me bro like. Alright bro. Big Hug So after giving some extra help
upgrading their shelter, the boys went to bed and made
the radio call in the morning. What up boys? I got a message on the walkie. It's going to have to be
mine to explain, Jimmy. I'm not going to be the big macho
man and say this isn't hard. All right, everyone, let's
walk him out of the challenge. Come on. Leaving the boys camp
for the last time. - Sami, give the guys a parting gift.
- You want a T-shirt? - I'll take a T-shirt.
- The literal clothes on his back. Let's get those shorts Now that you've taken everything
from this man, is he free to go? He's free to go. He is now in the Sherpa, which means
he is officially eliminated. Karl, get him out of here! Now we're down to three. Is
the trend going to continue? Two days from now,
we're going to be a one. Absolutely not. Just two weeks into the challenge,
we had already lost half the players and things were only getting worse. I looked at that truck that picked him up
and my first thought was jealousy. I don't know if I can make it to
the end. With Josh already on the verge of quitting. Things got even worse
as a massive storm rolled in. It's raining right here. Unlike the girls who could sleep
soundly in their well-built shelter back at the boys camp, their home was not equipped
to handle all of the rain. This is not how I want this to end. The torrential downpours
continued for the next two days. My raincoat had drenched through
and my whole belly was soaking wet in my waders
and my pants were soaking wet. I was like, ready to quit. The rain has finally cleared up
and Mama Phaedra is making us
some little breakfast this morning. I've got a little beef stew.
It's delicious. - I bet the boys are enjoying a happy meal.
- I bet they're not. Bad news, I ran into my worst enemy. Poison ivy. It's spreading everywhere
and unbearable painful. And I started wondering
if my time here is coming up. We're in a better
spot than the guys. Has to be, right? Not a lot of people can take this
for a long amount of time. Hey, guys, we need to talk. The things I wanted to do,
I definitely did. And at some point
there is just the need to get out. The selfish
part of me says you quit. I get a bigger meal. Hey, this is Josh at men's camp. I think I am ready to go today. And just like that, Josh was out. - Josh, hop on in.
- Let's go, Karl! Let's hit the road. I'm gonna say this like, honestly, I
believe 100% we just got stronger. We have enough food to last us
as long as possible, plus win all the challenges. That's a pretty bold statement. So let's put that claim to the test. - What day is it, Chandler?
- It's Friday. It's day 20. Which means it's time for our second
challenge. Alert! Alert! Pick a captain
and send them to the bridge. Easy work. All right. I'll see you in a minute.
Okay. Sounds good. I'm going to show her that
no matter what, she will never win. Since both of you didn't come
last time, I need to make it clear. You step across the middle.
You're eliminated. which may affect your team's
chances of winning 500,000 dollars. Chandler, can you give me
something to mark the middle? - It's okay. We'll put it back.
- Yeah. There you go. - Hello.
- Hi. - Nice to meet you.
- You too. My team and I are offering you. And whoever's still at camp $50,000
if your team quits right now. Sounds like you might be scared
that you might not make it to the 500 K. Anyone else feel the tension here? We'll see in day 33
when it's all over. You’re only giving yourself till day 33? Giving you till day 33. You guys are being as nice
as possible. Also talking so much smack
at the same time. Let's bring it together. So, because the storms
are decimating your shelters in this challenge, you're gonna be competing
for your own ginormous tent. This thing is bug proof. Waterproof. Hurricane season's coming
in, so this would be clutch. Would you want something like this? I mean, I'll take it, but if the guys get this taste
of comfort, maybe they'll leave. - Or it can make them last longer.
- Doubt it. Oh, this is very nice. It's decision time. So this is different than the last
challenge because both your teams could win a tent. I'm going to be in that tent. It would sit really nicely right there. All you have to do... is eliminate yourself. If Julia does take this, we won't
have one more night together. That'll be hard. Since the women won
the first challenge. - I need you to make your decision first.
- No, come on, Julia. Do you want to eliminate yourself
so your team can have that tent? I'm going to take the tent. Okay. So, it looks like, I am
now officially by myself. I honestly can't believe
you took that. Now it's your turn.
Which is more important? You or that tent? All right. My team. - Thanks for coming out.
- Thank you. That was crazy. Wait wait wait wait wait wait. I think it would really be huge for the overall strategy
and the win, but, I thought I was actually going to get
a chance to give her a hug goodbye. This isn't 100% rain proof. That
could really end the competition. My whole mood has just changed. Back at the bridge, while Phaedra was gathering her
new tent, TJ secretly
stayed behind to investigate. Wait. No way. And what he found was like striking
gold. It's weird to send only one
person to pick up that tent. Now I know there's only one
woman left. She will not outlast the two of us. I got to tell Pat. Patrick,
are you awake? I spied on them,
and it's one person left. The person that you went
against on that first challenge. We have two, less food, less shelter. Now that you say like that, I feel like
I made the wrong decision. Would
you have preferred the tent or me? The tent. Unfortunately for TJ, the Intel he gathered at the bridge
seemed to only make matters worse for the boys. He turned down dry shelter to come back. What kind of brother
would do that? TJ If he would’ve took the tent,
it would have sealed the deal Because we all know shelter
is everything. And at the girls camp, Phaedra
was officially carrying the team, setting up her brand new tent
in just a few hours. Look at that. It's awesome. Just in case people are wondering
who's going to win this. It's nice and cool in here. No bugs. There is more room than I know
what to do with in here. While Phaedra had more room, the boys realized that having each
other was the most valuable thing if they wanted to win their
team half a million dollars. You may have that tent,
but you're all alone. Us here at the guys camp,
we still got two so we could always be socializing. And by challenge three,
she's going to want to leave. For sure, bro. It was a pleasure
being around Julia. Having such a lovely human
to interact with. Got me spoiled, honestly. The boys seem to have much more
than just each other too. About to go crawdad hunting.
This is where killer Patt comes in. Need to get some food. Living off the land was going much
better than I expected. There we go, and that's
snapping turtle right there. But while the boys are finally
thriving, Phaedra has found herself
in a dark place. I do miss having
some physical contact with people and like being able
to give somebody a hug, or just like even a handshake
or a high five would do. How about a high five? At this point,
Phaedra literally began talking to herself
out of loneliness. However, the boy's bond
was continuing to grow. Dang, dude, that's as big as you. Look at the size of that thing. Dude, that's literally 5.5ft long. Sorry, six foot five. I'm so excited for Challenge Day
right now. I'm hoping
that we just go ahead and win. I'm ready to go home to my family.
I'm ready for this to be over. We're going to see how challenge
three goes. With TJ and Patrick's bond
having grown stronger than ever. I knew exactly how to test them
on the day 30 challenge. Are you going to be the captain? I was asking around,
but nobody else was here. - By default, I'm the captain.
- Okay. You did day ten. You did day 20. Who's going to be the day 30 captain? - Patrick.
- Back to back. Lets go. Go get that dub. All right, this time we've painted
a line instead of using a plant. Been a while
since you saw each other. I'm really surprised to see you
here, actually. Yeah. - Are you two ready to hear the challenge?
- Yes. - Yes, sir.
- Here's the deal. We have the families
of every single contestant still in this challenge
on the other side of the woods. And you guys have a choice to make. You can see your family, or everyone
in your camp can see their family. You know, I do have a son
that I would really like to see. so, I... I'm going to choose myself. Phaedra could’ve just tricked Patrick into
thinking she’s not the only woman left. How about you? Are you picking your
camp or yourself as well? I got to see my kids. I choose myself, too. Okay.
The decisions have been made. Load the helicopters
and fly them out. Oh, it's so good to see you. - Say Mister
- Mister. - Beast.
- Beast. - Challenge.
- Challenge. - Let's go!
- Let's go! Let's go.
Hey, beautiful. I miss my mom. And I really missed my son. My family is the main reason
why I was out here. And the reason
why I'm still standing here. My time has just been reset. I'll see y'all ten days. I'm just going to sit here
and just feel sad. I haven't felt like the best today. I've had some time to reflect
on the last challenge, I'm super grateful
for that experience and for having him come,
but after seeing Lincoln. I really want to go home. I'm not going anywhere. I was a little bit worried
when Patt got to see his family. I'm locked
and loaded for challenge four. But it just lit a fire underneath
him to say, I'm going to win this. Obviously,
I've got to this point because of me trusting another person. This right here is about to prove how important a strong
and good friendship is compared to doing things on your own. And although having someone by
your side can ward off the boredom, being alone had its perks as well. I don't even know
if I can eat this all. I literally have more food
than I can eat out here. I'm not going anywhere, Men's camp. And so it was the battle
of the rations versus companionship. That is, until the night came and the men's camp got a
surprise visit from an uninvited guest. What is that? There's something out there. Stay still. And when the morning came, TJ
was brave enough to find out exactly just what
the source of the noise was. Yeah,
that's definitely from a bear claw. Verified by our trail cam. A bear came up right
behind the men's shelter, which would be enough to scare
any sane person. Last night, a bear came through camp. Awesome. And although Patrick was feeling
confident about staying yesterday, I'm not going anywhere. This close encounter
had him thinking otherwise today. Haven't you seen my family? That bear got me realizing
like I don't do outdoors. It's like breaking news. I'm a DJ. Yo, TJ,
we got to talk about something. - Yeah. What's up?
- Me and TJ we're just speaking. The rations will make more sense if I leave
so that TJ can finish this. Him saying to me, I trust you,
and I'm going to leave is huge. Yes. For this is... He's going to be fine. Please let me grab the talkie. This is Patrick at Man's camp. I am exiting the competition. On my way. And since I have Logan
Paul and KSI with me, I guess I'll bring them along too. Dude, this is gorgeous. If you're gonna survive in the wilderness,
this is like the environment to do it. Bro how do you know where anything is? What? What? Oh, no. I just saw a little fly. Yo, Patrick. I got the call that you want to go? Yeah, I want to leave him
with the most amount of food. - Can I see how much food you have left?
- Oh, yeah absolutely. - Come over to our pantry.
- Now that he's leaving. How long do you think
this food will last you? This will get me to day 60, challenge 6. How long do you think
the girl or girls have left? By challenge
five, it's going to be over. No shot. She already has 13 days in
isolation. I'm just starting at one.
We have the advantage. I am alone. So with both camps now
only having one remaining survivor, they both had to find ways
of fighting the isolation to make it through the next
few days. And while TJ hunted the animals to make up for his dwindling
rations, Big Belly. Phaedra was hunting them
to actually keep as pets. Little princess Shirley. Neither TJ or Phaedra were showing
signs of giving up, which brought them
all the way up to day 40, which of course
means another challenge. Welcome back. It's been ten days. Hi. Dude it's awesome
that you spent this time alone, but how do you logically plan
to beat me? Because we have enough rations
to last us 80 days. I don't have
responsibilities back home. And then on top of that,
we're having fun at camp. There's nothing to do. I don't like to get ahead of myself and be like, “Yeah, I’ve got 90 days,
I've got this in the bag.” Because like when you started
to get arrogant. But in 20 days, 30 days,
do you really want to be here? What about Lincoln? I don't really think you should use
people's children's names
as weapons against them. That's not appropriate. I will use whatever weapon I can. It's getting intense. How you decide to treat me has no factor
on how long I decide to stay out here. Likewise. Time for a day 40 challenge. Both of you will be presented
with the survival item. If you want it, then simply write it down on your board
and you'll keep it. However, if both of you write it
down, neither of you will get it. This means that you'll have to try to convince each other
to actually keep an item. And for our first item,
we have a fishing pole and all the bait
you could ever need. And one of you give up an item
without receiving something in return. They both wrote fishing rod. Not off to a good start. Our next item is Dude Wipes
who help me pay for the video. Dude Wipes are flushable
disposable wet wipes made from 99% plant
based materials and water. Oh very refreshing. It's time for what might be the most
important vote of your life. Not only are
they better than toilet paper, but Dude Wipes also work
well for showering, which these two could use. He wrote Dude Wipes.
And she wrote... Nothing. Whoa, congratulations! Here you go! I got Dude Wipes. Item number three
is more Dude Wipes because they're the sponsor of the video. - What do you think of the Dude Wipe?
- I mean, it's working. Yeah, it's working amazing.
It's time to vote. Did you write anything? He did not.
All right, here's your Dude Wipes. If you want to be like these two
and try dude wipes for yourself. Just go to Walmart, Amazon
or basically anywhere you shop at. They sell them there, stop
using normal toilet paper. That's for losers. Getting to clean themselves after
over a month, it was a real boost and at this point, either one
could win it for their team. but thanks to the girls strategy of intentionally eliminating
most of their team early on. Phaedra’s not worried about food at all. They say how much gas you have
in the tank, and truly, my answer is until they decide
they don't want to be here anymore. As the days passed, TJ was getting more confident
he would win it for the boys. I'm just so set on this
ending challenge five I'll be heavily surprised
if this goes past challenge five. Everything in my heart,
soul, mind is saying challenge five. Even though it's come down to a 1v1,
both TJ and Phaedra are still in it for their fallen soldiers. And as for TJ, a victory couldn't
come soon enough. I'm going to have
a double portion of rice. Just make sure that I'm going to have a fantastic
winning day of day 50. And now it was time to put all that
talk to the test and see if our day 50 challenge
will really be in TJ's favor. Contestants, come on in.
Come on in. I couldn't make day 50 because I'm currently
spending seven days in a cave, - so I'm hologramming in.
- How's the cave? Oh my gosh this is insane! It's pretty brutal, not going to lie. You guys haven't
seen each other in a while. You want to talk? All right. What do you two think
the day 50 challenge is? I have no idea. I see a container
that says supplies on it. For day 50. We're going to celebrate. And you both get Feastables. - Okay!
- Yes! But little did they know,
there was a twist coming. You each get a multipack
of chocolate. That's so nice. Yeah. These are available in Walmart,
Albertsons and Kroger's nationwide. Go buy Feastables
and try it for yourself. - That's it.
- You can go back to your camps. Enjoy your chocolate or save it. See you on day 60. - Are they far away?
- Yeah. Okay, what they don't know Chandler is inside one of those
chocolate bars is a message that tells them to come back to the
middle to get three days worth of food. You show the viewers
the food. Let's see who finds the message
first. And wins that food. I'll see you in a couple
of days, Chandler. I love you. Wait. Say it back. He didn’t say it. Challenge five. We finally got our Feastables. These are chocolate. Chocolate will melt. So I need to find the best way
to store these. I think I might just open another one
because honestly, I know that seems excessive,
but it's my win. I have one square after every meal
that should last me throughout
the rest of the competition. My mental health right now after
challenge five is through the roof. While TJ was feeling confident,
he was so strict on rationing that he barely made
a dent in the Feastables. I feel like I'm better rationing my
chocolate because that's a better commodity. So I know I have to save it. And save it he did. TJ went the next three days without touching
a single piece of chocolate. But then on day 57, he found his
favorite flavor. A peanut butter Feastable. Whoa, wait, what?
There's something on the back. If you're reading this,
there is three days worth of food on the bridge
for the first person to grab it. Good luck Feastable, you'll have to wait. Let's go. Three days worth of food. So much. Let's go. I don't see her. This might be a man victory. Looks to be she already got it. Dang. Phaedra actually beat out TJ because
just four days ago this happened. Three days worth of food. It’s still here people. Oh, you guys. It feels really good to win this. Dang, Phaedra’s not
even here to gloat about it. I just feel so sad now.
I ran for nothing. Feels like
I've been here for nothing. If TJ isn't careful, that feeling
could quickly become reality. One of these contestants
will win their team $500,000, while the other will have
spent months in the wilderness and go home with
nothing to show for it I can't live off the land because
it'll take too many calories, and it's not even a guarantee
every day. We just killed the last
of our egg scramble. It has been difficult
for me to be alone out here. Every day is hard and is kind of
taking its toll on me. It is night 59. I will run out of rations tomorrow. I am praying that the prize
for tomorrow is more rations. I don't want to give up just yet. It's time for the day 60 challenge. So you guys met on day 40, Day 50 and once again on day 60. It's the two of you. How is the three days
of extra rations? I was going to ask you.
“How is your candy bars?” How are you feeling?
You got ten days left in you? Oh, I got ten days left in me. The day 60 challenge is simple. Both of you write down
anything you want. You’ll then show each
other what you wrote and if you approve each other's
items, you can have both of them. But if just one of you says no,
you both get nothing. You could ask for a lot and there's
a high chance, she says no. Or you could ask for a little
and potentially get it. - Do you have what you want written down?
 - I do. Do you have what you want written down? - Yes.
- 3, 2, 1, reveal. Phaedra wants an art kit
and TJ wants a private chef for seven days, two meals a day,
fully equipped with spices and food. Do you approve her
getting an art kit? Oh, yeah. TJ approved you getting an art kit. So nice. Do you approve his private chef
for seven days? Two meals a day with spices? I will run out of rations tomorrow. Oh, man. I would love to, but I can't,
I’m going to have to say no on that. What? You were too greedy. That was day 60. You're free to talk
as much as you want. Good luck in the next ten days. - See you on day 70?
- Yeah. - All right.
- All right. - Bye.
- See you! For me, the physical aspects of
things out here are not the problem. It's the mental things. There goes that idea. I had everyone's hopes
and dreams on my back. I think I'm going to have to put
that stone down. I want to go home so badly. I've just been out here for so long. I just received a radio call saying
someone wanted to leave. The person
leaving is waiting in this vehicle. Bring out the team. Each contestant here is about to
find out if their team just won $500,000. Will it be the men or the women? The contestant who forfeited
will now reveal themselves. The boys lost and the girls won. We didn't want you guys to go home
empty handed, so we're going to give each of you
ten grand for at least competing. Phaedra, still alone at the girls
camp and has no idea she's just won. Phaedra, are you here? - You're back?
- Yeah. Come with me real quick. I found this backpack,
and I was curious if it was yours. It might be. That was actually a lie. You just won! You did it! I really missed you guys. - I thought you guys every day
- You did it, though. - Yeah.
- You got it. You did it. You all just won $100,000 each. Maybe next time boys."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndAQfTzlVjc,7 Days Stranded In A Cave,1078,20240817,en,"I don't
normally do intros like this, but I'm currently descending
hundreds of feet into a cave that runs over
five kilometers deep into the Earth, and whether we like it or not. As soon as my friends
and I touch the ground, we are officially stranded here
for the next seven days. That might have been the scariest
thing I've ever done. First things first, we got to
get really far away - from where we rappelled down. 
- Why? If it storms, this entire area
could flash flood, fill up like an ocean,
and potentially drown us all. Which is why we're going deep
into the cave to set up base camp. Oh, this is just wicked. Dude, this is like a different world. This cave entrance may be beautiful,
but looks can be deceiving. We didn't know it yet, but the next seven days will by far
be the hardest of our entire lives. Worst idea ever. All right. It's going to get
dark in a couple hours. If we don't have a camp,
we're screwed. Okay? You don't have any idea 
where you're going. We're just looking for flat ground
to set up camp. Upon entering the mouth of the cave. We stumbled upon an area with high
enough elevation to protect us from any flash flooding, meaning
that it was perfect for camp. - Perfect is a crazy word.
- Good enough, is what I would use. Good enough for camp. We spent the rest of day one grabbing our supplies
that we were dropped with. Each one of these bags
weighs like 80 pounds. And as you can see by the footage,
we spent around four hours. This is very hard to traverse. Getting all of it
back up to our base camp. All right,
we've got some lights on in here. Our supplies are finally
at our home base. And if you point the camera over
there, you'll see it's pitch black. It took all day. And so we set up the bare minimum
for camping grounds. We drilled holes
to hang up some ropes. Grab this. 
Pull yourself up. It looks like the ropes will be able
to support hammocks. And with the help of our survival
guide, Joel, we hung our hammocks. This thin rope is what 
holds up my hammock? Yeah. Ate some dinner and prepared
for a very cold night one. Not gonna lie, this hammock is way more comfortable
than I thought it would be. Hey! Oh, God. Why is my head so big, bro? This cave is 2.5
kilometers deep, and we're basically camping
at the entrance. Tomorrow, we have a lot of exploring. How'd you guys sleep? - Horribly 
- I didn't. It's a very perplexing environment. The caves constantly
dripping water on us from above. So we put a tarp over us. But even still, the water's
dripping into our hammocks. I have an idea. Let's make our shelter
actually good. I say we connect these tarps
so we stay dry while we're sleeping here. That's literally genius. I'm not just a YouTuber, okay? My hammock gets out right here. Are we serious right now? This is where I just got out of bed. And we didn't realize it at the time,
but this hole is almost 40ft deep. So while Shawn and I got started
on the super tarp, Mack and Karl went to see how dangerous
this hole was for themselves. You see my hammock up there?
That is where I slept. Now look at this. And because everything
looks the same, and it's probably pretty hard
to follow us in this cave. On this map,
you could see our home base and how far they're moving
away from it. - All right, Mack. It's been real, bro.
- Bro, this is crazy. Well,
the boys are randomly exploring. Me and Shawn actually
have to work on the camp. Why is there a sleeping bag over here? Because it smelled like pee. Lesson number one,
don't rent your sleeping bags. Why did we rent sleeping bags? Why did we not just buy sleeping bags? We're zip tying the tarps together
to create one mega tarp. Don't mind me just trusting
this rope with my life. And meanwhile,
Mack and Karl were still in a hole. Oh my God, Mack. And eventually
they finally made it to the bottom. We're supposed to be working on camp. We just want to show how dangerous
camp was. Just don't fall. 
It's a skill issue. Oh, okay. And even though they should
have been on their way back, Karl and Mack insisted on seeing 
how deep they could go. Bro, this just looks so crazy. You think you can
make it through the river? But little do these two know, this river actually runs
throughout the entire cave. Which means we'll be spending
some time in it. Oh, there they are. - Tell me you guys cooked.
- We cooked. That's right. - A new home, am I right?
- Let's go. - We now have a roof. 
- Look at this. I'm not going to lie, 
you actually kind of cooked. And we moved the fire pit 
to this little cove we found. What do you think? - It's warmer. 
- It's cozy. These rocks trap the heat here and
block the pee from the rocks above. It's not pee. - What do I call it?
- I don't know, maybe rain or something. But it's not rain. It's rock. Hey, point it up, do you see clouds? No. You see rocks. 
It's not rain. - Rock pee.
- Rock pee. Rock pee, fine. All right, it's rock pee. And after a much drier
night of sleep, we decided to have Joel,
our survival expert, help us get all the way
to the end of the cave. - Cave!
- Cave! - Cave!
- Cave! - Cave!
- Cave! Cave! Let's see how deep in the cave
we can make it. Now, keep in mind, we are still just at the beginning
of this massive cave. And our goal is to make it all
the way through it, without dying, of course. Oh, my gosh,
this is kind of steep. You ain't seen nothing yet. We're going deep in the cave. - All right boys, suck in your guts.
- This is where things get tight. I don't actually think I'm going to fit. The interesting part about cave
exploration is one second you're barely fitting through cracks
in the rock. Oh, my God, this is so tight. And then the next, you're
in a massive chamber so big that in order to see it all,
we had to do this. Oh my God. I can actually see now. This is awesome. This thing is bright. Well, look at how cool this is. Yeah! - So bright I can't even look at it.
- I'm getting blinded. Oh, no. Oh, no. In hindsight, we probably didn't use
that the most effectively. Lead the way. And so we continued on. Feel free, there's a really 
good handle up the top there. And then you can sort of swing
a foot around onto this one. Yeah, yeah, 
perfect. Joel, the best caving guide ever. No one's died yet. All right, guys, this
is where things get interesting. What? What is this? So from this point on, wetsuits. We're going for a swim. Yesterday, Mack and Karl
were joking about doing this, but the rest of this cave adventure takes place in a freezing river. Oh my gosh, this is insane. Meaning wetsuits are the only way 
to not get hypothermia. Why are we doing this? This is a once
in a lifetime experience. Because you die after you do it. So in order
to get to the end of the cave, we have to hop in this river
and fight the rapids through this tiny hole in the rocks and carefully squeeze
our way through. Take your time. It will take your feet 
behind you a little bit. All right. I'm getting in the river. You wanna follow the wall 
around to the left. It’s so cold! You got it, Jimmy. I don't know if I fit. Jimmy, I need you to pull yourself
up out of the water. Oh my God.
What's crazy about doing this, Oh, it's so cold. Is when you're completely submerged
in freezing cold water. Gripping onto the rocks
becomes incredibly hard. Oh, my gosh, that was crazy. Mack, Karl, let's go. I'm scared, bro. You got this. - Bro.
- Keep going. Look how crazy this is, dude. And even though this obstacle was
difficult, it's nothing compared to what's up ahead. We did it! - Cave, cave, cave.
- Cave, cave. Hey, boys,
we're now 10% done. Which means we've only scratched
the surface of this expedition. And we still have over two kilometers
remaining to reach the end. As you can see, it
rains in this cave 24/7. So I'm making a chill spot
for us to hang out and not get wet. I wonder what I would look like
if I wasn't here to build all this. Pretty sure they'd just be sleeping
in a pile on a wet rock. It's important that we keep moving now that the bodies are wet. Temperatures are going to drop quickly. Why is this so difficult? The worst part is, every inch
we go this way is an inch. we got to go
that way to get back to camp. Our next obstacle
may be out of the water, but that doesn't make it
any easier to get through. Is that a spiderweb? Spider? I don't see the spider. That means it's probably on us. It's on you. It's on you. I hate my friends. This cave is like a MrBeast video. The further you go, the harder
it gets. Just straight up. If we didn't have Joel, I'd be dead. And after three hours,
Joel had some bad news for us. The water is too high,
and we've taken too long. We're gonna have to turn around
for today and head back to camp. I disagree. You can't disagree
with the safety expert. I disagree. Well,
we can't really disagree. It turns out we wasted
way too much time filming and playing with flares, to the point
where we now had to restart and attempt
this mission another day. Shawn, we're back. What'd you do while we were gone? Hopefully nobody gets wet now. - I didn't even know we packed lights.
- Yeah, they're awesome, right? Sadly, we only made it 20%
through the cave today. But mark my words, we will go
the distance in a future day. - I doubt it.
- That's not going to happen. We might rest on day four
and then on day five, try to go all the way to the end
of the cave and see what's there. Day three was a lot of fun. I'll see you guys tomorrow. And after a third
miserable night in the cave the next morning,
we only had one thing in mind. A hot shower would
literally save my life right now. Oh, showering would be awesome. I haven't showered in three,
four days. As you can imagine, showering inside
a cave isn't easy. We had to hike all the way back
to where we rappelled in to safely reach the riverbed. Oh, no.
Oh my God. I feel my brain. I've never felt my brain like this. My forehead is frostbite. Let's use the drone to dry our heads
off. - Come here, drone.
- Stop, stop! It's actually working.
Yeah, it is working. Who needs a hairdryer 
when you have a drone? And after we dried off, we sat down
with Joel to plan our journey. - What is this, Joel?
- This is the map of the cave. Last time we had to stop
because of the fast moving water. But the rains have been slowing, so we might just get a window
to reach the end by tomorrow. This is going to be wild. First, we'll need to pass some of
those same rapids from yesterday. Dive off massive
cliffs and avoid jagged rocks. And if we can make it past all that, we will finally make it
to the beautiful glowworm chamber. Don't tell us what that looks like. - I want us to be surprised.
- Do you think we're going to make it? No, let's not play that game. 
We're all going to make it. With tomorrow's plan 
thoroughly mapped out, we've rested up and made Feastables
s'mores to regain our energy. Everyone cheers! Joel's about to have 
his first Feastables s'more. All right, Joel, be honest. That's good. - Joel approves?
- Joel approves. Why didn't we whip this
chocolate out earlier? This just got, like,
ten times more fun. Guys, for real, if you've never tried s'mores
with Feastables, you're really missing out. Tomorrow we're going to explore
the entire cave. We'll see you guys then. So we tried to sleep
as much as we could and prepare for tomorrow's journey
to the end of the cave. We're about to embark on one of the
most dangerous journeys of my life. Because of our experience from day
three and focusing less on filming, we were able to make progress way
faster. Ooh, this water's cold. Just like the other day, bro. Nice bro, easy. And to ensure our best chance
of survival. In addition to Joel, we brought
another survival expert with us. This is where we had to stop on day
three. How are we doing? We're making much better time! Behind us, it's pitch black. 
Where do we go? This area gets narrower,
the currents strong. So we're going to use the walls
and gonna climb our way along. So here we go. Oh, God. Yeah. Jump to that first rock, There's a couple of good
rocks around the corner as well you can get a hand onto. - It's so dark down here.
- There's no bottom right now. My feet aren't touching
the ground right now. Because we couldn't
reach the ground. This meant that if we let go now,
we could get swept away by the strong current
directly beneath us. Joel, what are we doing? I would go into here if you can. That's a good one. I can't even see where I'm going, Joel. The current is taking me away. How do I do this? You've got to get yourself in there
and it's going to get way gentler. - I go in here?
- Yeah, in the hole. Yeah! Well done. This might be the most
insane thing we've ever done. We are much deeper in the cave
than we've ever been. And we're now approaching
our first serious obstacle. Basically, the water's
recirculating, so if you fall in, it takes you to the bottom
and it keeps you there. If we fall, we would die. - Yeah. 
- Okay, so death is on the table? This is just not what I thought
I was signing up for. Well done. Yeah! Over! - So now I put my foot here?
- Yeah! Correct. - Oh, yeah. 
- Woo! Caving is a lot harder than I thought. You can tell how strong this river is 
because it created this entire cave. And fun fact, 
we're not as strong as a cave. I'm barely as strong as a human. Well, fortunately for us,
rather than Karl leading this expedition,
we've got the literal avenger, Joel. And just to prove
how much of an expert he is, this man literally
flexed on us by jumping off a cliff. Oh my god. You're crazy. Who else is a bit crazy? Surely one of you guys are keen. I'm crazy. No shot, you want to do that. What are you talking about? I'm doing it right
now, baby. Let's go, Joel. Godspeed, Mack. After everything Jimmy's put me through, this ain't that scary for me. Three. Two. One. Are you doing it? No. We've got to keep going 
or we won't hit the end. Oh my God. We go downstream? Why are we always fighting
the current? I might just start drifting away.
I might just give it up. There are sharp rocks underneath the water. You cannot see them. So watch your step. - Oh my God. 
- It's getting deep again. I can't, I need to put my feet on
something. And if the sharp rocks
weren't enough of a challenge. It seems
like with every step we took. Bro! I can't see anything. This is terrifying. The caves became darker, tighter and ruthless enough
that we began to question if we could even get
to the finish line. This is exhausting. This cave is about to get a lot harder. And I have something I need to show
all of you. Joel, can I see your bag? Thank you. You know what you've been carrying? What have I been carrying? The brand new... MrBeast Lab Swarms. I'll be honest, guys. As you can see, because of what I've
been going through for the past five hours, I'm clearly in no shape
to tell you about this right now. And so, a month
after we filmed this, I built an entire cave set
threw on my Future Jimmy name tag, and then said: hey, Future Jimmy
here, and I'm going to tell you about my brand new toy line
up, MrBeast Lab Swarms. It's a collectible
toy line with over 119 uniquely designed characters
that you can collect. And the coolest part is to find out
which character you got. You pour water into this tube,
shake it up, and the swarms will appear
in front of your very eyes. And to demonstrate the product,
I made this giant life sized version of the swarms tube,
fill the tube with water. You won't need this much water. This is just a giant tube.
All right. And now that this is filled
with water, Mack's going to give it a little shake. Is it shaken up enough? I think it's shake it up enough. Then you pour out the water.
Do the honors, Joel. And out of the water
will be revealed. which two swarms you got. This is the rarest one,
the hyperchrome. That I only made a thousand of. Joel, you can have it. - You can have that one.
- Who does Karl get? I only have two. If we didn't
just stop with the swarms. We also made
these action figure panthers that are in these briefcases
and this mutator that, just like the swarms, has a really cool reveal
when you buy it. Where do I buy them? I'm glad you asked, MrBeast's Labs Toys are now available
everywhere in the world you buy toys. They're all out now. 
Go give them a try. And after more brutal trekking
throughout the cave, we finally arrived at the glowworm
chamber. Man, this better be worth it. All righty team. Welcome to the glowworm chamber. Holy crap! That is crazy. Dude,
this does not look like it's Earth. All of the lights you see here are actually created
by tiny bioluminescent glowworms. That kind of looks like 
the Milky Way galaxy. At this moment, this view
honestly made that trek worth it. While making it to the glowworms 
was definitely worth the trip, our journey was still not over because we had to go
all the way back to base camp. It's almost day six. They're not back and I'm exhausted. I don't know
if I'll be able to sleep though, just worried with them being gone
so long. The trip back is way easier because we're just floating
with the current. Now, because you guys
have already seen the trip, we're going
to expedite the way back. But seriously,
this whole journey took so long. We crossed into day six
before reaching camp. Shawn. What's up guys? I was starting to get worried. Happy day six Day six. Let's go. All we had energy to do
was thaw out by the fire and finally eat some food. That was a very adventurous day. I'll see you guys tomorrow. Or later today,
it is day six. Yeah, maybe today, 
I don't know. Despite being physically obliterated
from our excruciatingly long hike, no matter what I did, I was
really struggling to fall asleep. I spent seven days in solitary confinement, seven days buried alive, 
seven days on a raft. And I'm going to be honest, I think
this is harder than all of those. You're constantly soggy and cold. I just keep hitting my body
on these hard of rocks and it hurts. 90% of the time
this cave is miserable. But between me and you... - Jimmy!
- Yo! Karl, can you see me? That's the world's
brightest flashlight. There are moments of fun
in this cave. From conquering rapids
300ft underground. With me and the boys
laughing in our hammocks. All the misery is worth it. Because when you're in good company. Let's make whale noises. This wet, cold, rocky,
miserable cave can easily transform into the most
beautiful trip of our lives. We cannot
leave until everything is picked up. And when I say everything,
I mean everything. Let's get out of here. And after our journey
back to the mouth of the cave. Oh, it looks so good up there. We had one more surprise for Joel. Before we head out, Joel,
as a show of gratitude. We got you 50,000 New Zealand dollars. So it's ten grand for every human
you didn't let die. Oh, gosh. Thanks so much, Jim. Let's go. Joel! We love you, Joel. Now that we got that out the way,
let's leave. After seven
long days, we're finally leaving."

never met each other are going to attempt to live down here
for the next 100 days. Take your blindfolds off. Hugo, this is Rayne. - Rayne, this is Hugo.
- Nice to meet you. This is their first time ever meeting. And this is the nuclear bunker
they will call home. Everything you would need to live
for the next 100 days is in this bunker. You can even grow your own vegetables. - Cool.
- If you come over here. You'll find your bedroom. All 40 feet underground. - Wait, what?
- Oh my God. - Above you is a bed.
- Nice. And here's another bed. And most importantly, over here
is your half $1 million. - Dude. It's real.
- Well, it better be. If both of you
stay in here for 100 days. You keep it. But if one of you leaves, you
both get nothing. We're not leaving. 100 days, you could have 
half a million dollars. - Wow. 
- That's so much money. Okay. let's see if they survive 100 days. I can't believe we're actually here. Isn't it crazy? 
Like this is our new house. - I know. 
- You're my roommate now. We're not going to see the sun
for 100 days. If we can grow our own food,
we're here to be set. So far,
they seem to be getting along. But little did they know,
that wasn't going to last for long. You are so stupid. You're a monster. I don't like you, dude. Hey, hey. We're getting ready for night one. Hopefully we don't fall off tonight. - Good night, Hugo.
- Goodnight, Rayne. Good morning. I will say I don't like that 
I don't know what time it is. We didn't know each other
at this time yesterday. We didn't. Now we're just cooking breakfast. And even though
these two literally just met, they're going to have to work
together. If they want to win half $1 million. However, like always,
there's going to be a twist. That does look a little sus, 
that little thing right down there. Hey, yo, what is that? Why are these boxes locked? I don't know, man. There's something going on here
we don't know about. See this button right here? 
Don't touch it. It represents
the twist of the century. But to find out about that, they're going to have to wait
until day ten. That is, of course, if they
don't die from boredom first. What do you want to do today? I'm going to learn
how to play guitar. Why do I need a radio
when I can be the radio? What the heck? Over the next hundred days, 
I'm going to learn Spanish. It's our third day in the bunker. Let's go. We're going to come out
so ripped at the end of this. You're my new favorite human
in this world. You're the coolest person
I know down here. What? And by day four, the challenges of living with a stranger 
were becoming more apparent. I got to tell you something. You were snoring bad last night,
actually. Sorry. Some earplugs would be nice, but
it's okay. If Rayne ever annoys me, this'll just freak her out. This is our view of the outside. It's just dirt. So gross to look at. Hey hey hey. But since leaving would cost him
half $1 million, they were going to have to make
the best of it. I made enough salad for both of us. I am so bored. Today we're building
a throne of canned food. I'm Hugo. I'm Rayne. - And this is life in the bunker.
- And this is life in the bunker. No! And once they got to day 10, 
it was time for my special offer. Wow. It's Jimmy. All right. I think it's time I show you guys
the twist of this video. There's
two boxes on each side of the room. - Yeah, we saw that earlier.
- What do you think's behind you? - A button?
- A button. Oh my God. A hand scanner. And on the other side,
another hand scanner. Oh, and one more thing. A one minute timer. Hey, Chandler, do the thing. Finally. As you'll see, 
the timer's now counting down. If you let that timer ever hit zero, your
money will instantly be engulfed in flames, incinerating every single dollar
of that half a million. And to stop your money from burning. You two are going to have to work
together. It's pretty simple. Put your hands on those scanners,
and there you go. The timer stopped. So every single day, at some random time, 
this will happen. - Every single day? 
- Every day. - What if I'm showering?
- I don't care the reason why. If you guys mess up just one time, both of you
are leaving with nothing. - Oh my gosh.
- See you in a couple of days. Oh my God. I won't be able to sleep
comfortably. Ever. - Yeah, yeah.
- For 100 days. If we mess up one time, we're done. - We should move our beds down here.
- Okay. I still feel this weight on my
chest, but only goes off once a day. But it could be at any time. I'm not going to lie. I am a lot more stressed out. Just having that lingering
feeling that the button could be pressed at any moment. Oh my God. Rayne, Rayne, Rayne, Rayne. Go go go go. Oh, God. That scared me. Dude, my heart just dropped to my toes. Well, it's not going to go off 
again today, so. And after the daily alarm,
Hugo and Rayne spent their free time reading
and learning to work together. This is Beast Boot Camp. Get down and give me two. And honestly, it seemed like they were on track
to win this half $1 million. But to test their strength
as a team, one morning I visited them at 6am 
to press the alarm To see if I could trip them up. Oh my God, hurry! But they were still pretty fast. However, Hugo and Rayne weren't
just quick at my alarm, considering it only took them 13 days to find the surprise
I had hidden under the floorboards. Is that a latch? There's no way
we're supposed to know about this. Tying up. No way. This is like a whole
other world. There's so much. And now that they're equipped
with the world's best chocolate. Hugo and Rayne were really 
starting to get into the groove of saving their money
from burning every day. - Let's do this.
- We got this, Rayne, we got this. And with every day gone by, they were one day
closer to winning $500,000. We scare the alarm. The alarm doesn't scare us. From now on, every ten days,
I'll bring them a new offer. And since it's day 20. Nolan, can you hear
us? - Yeah. 
- Press the button. You guys
have gotten very good at this. And literally do it
in a couple seconds every time. Which makes me wonder,
do you even need a minute anymore? - Yeah.
- We would like it. - Yeah.
- We definitely... Yeah. Let's see how much you'd like it. I will add an extra $50,000
to your prize pool. For a grand total of $550,000. If you let me shrink this one minute
timer down to 30 seconds. Really think about it. Because the next 80 days,
you will only have 30 seconds to place both of your hands on these. If you miss once. $550,000 burns instead of 500,000. Let's think about this. This is a lot of money on the line. Now we're about to shrink the timer
and make everything harder. Is $50,000 worth it? I don't know. We've been here in less than 10s
every time. I think we
can do it. We should do it. Let's go.
Let's do it. We're doing it. It will now permanently rest at 30 seconds. Nolan. Here comes the money. As promised. Here's your $50,000. Hopefully it doesn't get you out. I'm not going to lie, 
that may have been a stupid decision. No, you can't say that now. Actually,
it was a phenomenal decision. You see, not once did they
even come close to failing. Each day getting to the hand scanner 
in under 10 seconds. Rayne, we got this alarm thing in the bag. Now it's like don't get too bored
in here. So with day 30 offer. Let's see if we can take
the difficulty up a notch. It's day
30, and I have another offer. Instead of telling you the offer. I'm going to show you. Press the button. Oh, it's quiet. That's my offer. $50,000 will be added to the prize pool
bring it up to $600,000. But there will be no noise
when the alarm goes off every day. I'll give you guys
some time to discuss it. Yeah. We won't get the alarm back. What if this is the last money
offer? We got $550,000. We've been able to protect so far. Is that not enough? We would have to take shifts from
now on until the challenge is done. Do you want to do that? Dude, it's so much money. All right, guys,
it's time to decide. Do you want
$50,000 added to your prize pool? If you let me turn off the sound? As much as we would like it. - We can't.
- We're passing. Really?
You can both buy Teslas. We could already buy Teslas, though. - You can buy more Teslas.
- I only need one car. All right, I'll see you in... I don't know, sometime
in the future. See you later. Maybe. I can't believe we said no. Jimmy just offered me $50,000. Who says no to that?
Rayne. Say no to that much money hurts. He'll come around to it.
He'll get over it. I think we made the right decision. So in an attempt
to recover their relationship, they moved all their food supplies
out of the way to paint a mural for their new team
name, the Sewer Rats. Dang, I crushed that. Yeah. You're welcome. But it wasn't enough
because Hugo was still frustrated that he was doing
most of the chores, such as feeding the fish
and cleaning their tank. - This is gross.
- Oh my gosh. And maintaining the garden. So they never ran out of fresh
vegetables? Yeah. Good job, good job. - What would I do without Hugo? 
- Die! And on top of that, Hugo had done
most of the cooking himself. And since they were eating
three times a day, that meant he had cooked over 100
meals for the both of them. Oh, my God, you're
like my own personal Waffle House. Don't disrespect me like that. And while the tension
was continuing to grow between them, my day 40 offer wasn't going 
to make things any easier. And before we go in the bunker,
it's time to bring out the sucker. - Nolan?
- I was going to say that - The money sucker.
- Okay. To kick off day 40. Hey, Chandler, do the thing. Chandler and Tareq
are currently aboveground vacuuming up a $100,000,
which you have not lost. - We're doing it. 
- It's sucking. And for the next ten minutes,
if one of you leaves, you can walk away with the $100,000
they just vacuumed out, and the other person
won't be eliminated. But you'd be abandoning your teammate
to be isolated in this bunker
to win the other 450 grand. If one of you want to leave,
now's the chance. Maybe I could leave. I do everything around here. I do all the cooking.
I take care of the plants. I even entertain you with how bad
I am at the guitar. I think I might leave. - No you can't. 
- I think I am. We were supposed to be Sewer Rats together. We can do this, dude. Where's your Sewer Rat mind, dude? If you want to say
yes to the next offer, I'll say yes. Whatever Hugo wants. 
I'll shake on that. I feel like
he's still going to take the ladder. All right. Is either one of you getting $100,000
stuffed in the back of your car right now? I'm going to say no. I'm sorry. - But I'm staying. 
- No. Let's go. I'll go
put the 100 grand back in the pot. See you in ten days, then. And even though they ultimately decided
to stay together, Hugo's hesitation was testing
the bond of the Sewer Rats. It almost felt like
when you're getting broken up with. Kind of hopeless. Should I have let him just leave? - Hugo, what's your deal?
- You are a little weird. It was just a little too basic
for my liking. I'm so okay with being basic. - I don't like being basic.
- Okay, but that's obnoxious. You're so stupid. What did she just say? Dude, don't yell at me like that. That is insane. I don't know if they're making it. Over the next four days, Hugo and Rayne 
have barely even spoke to each other, which makes for terrible content. So I decided to shake things
up in the bunker by introducing a new variable. - What?
- That looks like another scanner. Are they bringing in another person? That is like my worst nightmare. I don't want to trust anybody else. But I guess we're going to find out
really soon. Very soon. How's it going? Hey, Jimbo. This ladder never gets less sketchy. I brought you two a friend.
Okay, close your eyes. Someone who knows a thing or two
about living in unusual places. I brought Ryan Trahan. - Okay. 
- You're a lot shorter in person. Not cool. That's the wrong foot
to get started on, because he's going to be spending the next 50 hours in the bunker
with the two of you. This is crazy. Now that you're a contestant. That was not supposed to happen. You have to play by the same rules
as Hugo and Rayne. I'm a liability. Okay.
You'll need to switch into this. You look thick. In exactly 50 hours 
is the 50 day mark. Ryan's going to be with you guys
until then. Have fun. Wait, Jimmy, no! Enjoy Ryan. - Hey guys.
- Hey. - Hugo?
- Hugo. I'm Ryan. - Ryanalicious.
- Hi, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, buddy. - New roommates. 
- New roommates. Guys. I'm shaking.
I'm actually nervous right now. To be honest, I probably should
have checked Ryan's bag because... I brought you something. Stop it. Beyonce. It's her album. It's her album, dude. It's time
for the first button press. But I'm gonna wait until they're very far
away from the hand scanners to press it. Oh, go go go go go. Nice. I'm going to use the restroom real quick. Okay. She uses the restroom all the time. I genuinely cannot fathom that they have been here
for almost 50 days already. Hugo and Rayne
do not really like each other, and it's actually a threat to them
finishing this 100 day challenge. You guys spend most of your time during
the days, kind of, like not talking? - Yeah, 
- Yeah, yeah. After
spending a whole day with them, I realize the entire reason that I'm here
is to make sure that Hugo and Rayne get to day 100. So today
we are doing a friendship test. A friendship test. The first test is a 60 second stare 
into each other's souls. Oh my God. Okay, you guys ready? Three. Two. One. Success! This is the final question. Rayne, why do you want to win for Hugo? This is such a crazy opportunity
for him. And he's the biggest fan of MrBeast. 
He's gotta win. They pick, like,
such a good person for this video, so. That's so true. Hugo,
why do you want to win for Rayne? I know how much her family helps her and literally given her the ability
to do anything. She really wants to repay to her
parents. I want to help her really better
their life. - That's it, I'm about to cry. 
- Dang, man. If you guys can just remember you're doing it for yourselves,
but also for each other. - Yeah.
- 100%. Then this money is yours. Friendship test complete. - Thank you.
- You pass. With Ryan around, it seemed
like things were better than ever. And when it was finally day 50. - Jimmy.
- You're having a party. They even made a chocolate cake
using Feastables, which obviously tasted phenomenal. Happy 50 day to you. You guys are both incredible
human beings. Come here. Unfortunately, Ryan, your 50 hours
are now over. I must escort you out of here. The first thing I see out
of apocalypse bunker is Nolan's face. And he almost
turned back around. And now that Ryan has left. What do you think your day 50 offer is? I personally think
since we're halfway done you're going to cut the time in half. It's not far off. My day 50 offer is for every second 
you take off this timer, - I'll add $5,000 to the prize pool.
- I like that. That's the offer.
You have ten minutes to decide. I'm thinking either 10 or 15. That's too risky. You said I can say yes to any
challenge I wanted to if I stayed. 10 seconds down? - I'm cool with 10.
- Let's cut that 10. What are you guys thinking? We're cool with cutting down 10 seconds. I'll go get the money. - Thank you, Jimmy.
- There's your money, 600,000. And now that I've thrown away
another $50,000, I'm going to once again
leave you in this bunker. I'll see you in ten days. - All right. See you, Jimmy.
- Bye, Jimmy. Now it's day 51. It's the first morning without Ryan. So quiet down here now. So we just experienced 
our first 20 second alarm. It was a little scary, actually,
to see the alarm down in the teens. It was scary. Without Ryan
bringing peace to the bunker. Hugo and Rayne's relationship 
was beginning to unravel again. I want to make it very clear, Hugo, we don't have a charger
for this thing. I'm going to be the only one
to drain this battery. - I don't get one song?
- I've given you everything. You get some of my pineapples, you get all the coffee, you're eating my jam right now. Okay. Okay. Not like I put my hand on the other
scanner to get her $300,000. And in an already compact
bunker, Hugo needed to find ways to make space for himself. There's some storage space
in the floor, and I turned it into a little vibe cave. No girls allowed. Got my snacks, my books, and my couch. Painting with music feels amazing. You want to come hang out 
in my vibe cave? Rayne? What the heck? And as the days went on, the tension between Hugo and Rayne
was causing them to make careless mistakes. I'm going to feed these fish. Morning, fishes. Come on. 
Time to eat. Rayne! I'm coming! Rayne! Go, go, go, go, go, go! Rayne! That took way too long. I'm not about to lose $300,000 because Rayne doesn't have
her head in the game. I'm starting to forget
what my normal life was like. Waking up in the bunker. it's like my normal life doesn't seem 
like it's a thing anymore. It just feels like
it's a never ending cycle. But no matter
the case, Hugo and Rayne were continuously able to prevent me
from igniting their money. So come day 60, I wanted to see if
I could at least ignite their greed. Let's see
who gets to press the button. I win. No, I win. Oh, sheesh. I need to drop something. Do you mind moving really far away? Oh, nice. Sorry about that. For my day 60 offer, I will give you this $50,000
if you let me set off the alarm three times a day instead of one
for the remainder of the challenge. - Oh my God.
- I'll let you two converse. Dude, I really want to do that. It would be cool to do it. But I don't know how likely it is that
they just go off back to back like this. That would be ideal. All right. What are we doing with this $50,000? Am I adding it to your bank accounts
or not? - No.
- No. Really? I’ll take my money and leave. I think we made the right choice. We've been pretty uncomfortable,
but we don't want to be uncomfortable
for too long. 40 days is still a long time. And considering
they arrived at my bunker over two months ago,
by the time day 61 rolled around. Spring was in full bloom
and so was their restlessness. I'm kind of tired of like, waking up
and staying in one space all day. It's now our new normal
and it's now no longer fun. I just don't want to read anymore. 
Don't feel like journaling. I don't feel like painting. All the things that used to be fun
are just boring now. Having shared the same space
together for 60 plus days, Hugo was now becoming addicted to the alone time
he was spending in his vibe cave. I'm gonna go hang out in the vibe
cave and read. You've been reading all day, Hugo. I think Rayne's trying to get a little
upset with the amount of reading I do, but I don't want to go up there
and do the puzzle anymore. What? He stopped reading for two seconds. I think I'm going to hide his books. Rayne needed to take it into her
own hands if she wanted to gain back Hugo's attention. Did you hide my books? Did I hide your books?
No. Now I know you're
messing with me because I have another
stack of books right there. I thought they're over there. Like, think about it. She's starting to
gaslight me now. And I'm not gonna lie to you.
I'm pretty upset about it. You started thinking back to Jimmy's
offer on day 40. I could have taken that, but I said
no, because I wanted more money. So just knowing that
I have no other choice now because I decided to stay. I don't know if I can make it. After hearing the regret in Hugo's
voice, I had an offer on day 70 that would be too perfect
for him to pass up. But as always, first things first.
We need to press the button. - You closed it.
- I closed it. - What did you do?
- You turn their lights off. How's it going? We’re good, how are you? Before I could reveal the day 70 offer, 
I need to split you up. Hugo. Head upstairs. Rayne, go by the money. Time to set up the wall. These curtains are stressing me out. What's going on?
What's gonna happen? Hey, Karl,
go ahead and suck the money up. Sucking 200 grand. We're currently sucking up $200,000
out of the $600,000 prize pool. And similar
to one of my previous offers. If one of you leaves,
you get to walk away with 100 grand. I think I might leave. No, you can't. One of you can leave and go home
right now. You brought the offer back? Yes, but this time you can walk away with a guaranteed 200 grand without
eliminating the other person. Okay. But unlike my day 40 offer,
I separated you guys so that this time that she can't
stop you from leaving. If you still want to. That's spicy. Oh, my God, Jimmy,
why do you put me through this? You'd be doing Rayne a favor
because now, instead of competing for 300 grand, which is what you both would make
if you chose to stay. She's competing for 400 grand. So by leaving,
you're actually helping her? - I do give her 100 grand.
- Yeah. I don't know. 
I feel like he might leave. I don't know if I can forgive myself 
if I said no to $200k and I ended up losing this challenge. And while they're deciding on
whether or not they want 200 grand, I'm going to tell you guys
about Monster Hunter Now. What? Monster Hunter Now is a free to play
mobile game from Niantic. Kind of like Pokemon Go. Does that make either of
you want to play it? This is awful timing for this. Come on. And to really showcase this game,
I need to go to the surface. Monster Hunter Now encourages you
to go outside and find the monsters. Let's say you're walking a dog. You can hunt monsters,
or you're buying Feastables. You can still fight monsters. Or I'm on a date. That's not realistic, but
the fighting monsters is. Monster Hunter Now
also gave me my own in-game quests  available
for the next 30 days. Plus, MrBeast Sword,
shields, and other in-game items. Click the link in the description or scan this QR code to download
Monster Hunter and use Code MrBeastHunt 
to get special items for free. My quest is only available
for the next 30 days, so you need to
make sure you hurry. I almost left at 100 K. This is double that. And remember, if you don't step out,
you still have one month left in this bunker.
Do you want to see your family? Do you want to see the sun? And more importantly, do you care about
the other person of the bunker and want them to make an extra 100 grand? Five. Four. Three. Two. Last chance for a guaranteed
$200,000 One. We're coming down. There's
no way he's still over there. I'm now going to pull down these
curtains and reveal if someone left. Neither of you left. What? And since neither of you
left, here's your $200,000 back. I'll see you in ten more days. I just said no to $200,000. I'm amazed you said no.
I hope you don't regret it. Because I don't want to hear it. They may have stayed together, but the money was the only thing
keeping them here. I don't really care
to be doing this anymore. Sometimes the hardest part of this
challenge isn't even the alarm. It's living with another person. Especially when they're
so demanding. Would you mind making me chicken? Did you make me scrambled eggs? Do you think when
you're done you can make me a little bit
of eggs and chorizo. It's just sucks now. I'm just tired of doing
all the same thing every day. I don't mind helping Rayne,
but this is, like, too much. If Jimmy came down here and 
offered me 10K to leave right now I'd probably just dip. Spending all this time with Rayne
was starting to get to Hugo, and when their plants started
literally rotting, Rayne was hesitant to get her hands
dirty. Yeah,
if you just get that nasty water out. Well, you're not going to help here? - No, you got this.
- Thanks, Rayne. I'm going to do cartwheels. The smell. So I don't know why, but
I asked Rayne to give me a haircut. And of course,
she messed that up too. Destroying
Hugo's hair was the last straw, and his morale
was at an all time low. - I think I want to leave. 
- Go ahead. The money's going to burn
and we'll both win nothing. I could tell
that they were struggling. So let's see if my next offer cheers
them up or makes it way worse. I'm going to ask you two a question,
and if you answer correctly, I will not press the button
for the next 10 days. - You'll have 10 days off. 
- 10 days free would be crazy. But if you answer incorrectly, I'm going to shave
five seconds off the timer. Oh, I think I know exactly
what you're about to ask. The question is,
which tastes better? A Feastables chocolate bar 
or a Hershey's chocolate bar? Pretty obvious, Feastables. She's right.
This is great. That was easy. For the next 10 days, I'm
not going to press the red button. You guys should catch up on sleep
because day 90 won't be so easy. Rayne, Rayne, the alarm. Oh my God. I'll see you two then. - I'll say we can just cover this up. 
- Dude. You're right. See you in 10 days timer. And so, despite all the tension that's been building up
between them, removing the alarm might have been
the exact thing that these two needed
to start getting along. Since we don't have an alarm.
I could do whatever I want. So that's what I'm
doing. On the menu today. Donuts. Rayne said she would never 
ever cook or bake. My roommate is over there
making some donuts right now, dude. And they look great. Thanks, Hugo. 
All right, here are the donuts. Taste test. Feastables chocolate covered donut. Oh, my God, Feastables is so good. And since Feastables single
handedly saved their friendship, the rest of the 80s
went by like a breeze. And so they decided
to use their extra time from each day to prepare for
what was to come. What we should be doing
is preparing for day 90. Let's get this game plan together
and let's make sure we win. I'm going to have Hugo time me running from different areas
in the bunker to the hand scanner. Using the stopwatch on the
MP3 player Ryan gave us. Go. 2.61. That's... okay, okay. Go! 4.09. Okay, cool, cool, cool, 
cool, cool. Still under five. Go. 3.87, 3.57. Okay. 3.39. Day 90 to 100, it's going to be war. Go hard or go home. I'm going to go hard
because I'm not going home. The timer comes back
tomorrow on day 90. But after all this training, we got this. Time to take the sign down. There she is. It's officially day 90, which means
it's time for the first button push in over ten days. The button pressing is back. - Did you miss the button?
- Surprisingly little bit. Okay, coming down, here is a $100,000 
to add to your prize pool. And I'll give it to you right now,
increasing your balance to $700,000. And in exchange for this money, I'm actually going to give you more time on the counter, raising it from 20 seconds
to one entire minute. However, once you scan your hands
each day, the timer will not reset and that one minute will have to last you for the last
ten days of the challenge. Okay. We'll give you one minute
to think on it. What do you think?
What do you think? - It's kind of scary, but... 
- This is a lot of money. Our math is there. We've averaged
less than five seconds every time. Every time. - All in.
- All right. - Go hard or go home.
- Go hard or go home. Jimmy,
we made our decision. - All right, what is your decision?
- We're going to do it. - You sure?
- Yes. No takesie backsies. Adding it to the money pile. All right. - Go hard or go home, that's what it is.
- Jimmy, I'll see you in 10 days. Since we officially have
$700,000 on the line and only 60 seconds, it's time
we redecorate a little bit. We've set up the bunker,
so we don't have to move more than a foot away from the scanner. We even brought all the food
we need over here. We've been in here for 90 days,
and it all comes down to this. Let's see how we turn off the alarm
from our new seating area. 1.11. That's crazy. Every second literally counts. And terrified
that we would press the button. These two waited by their hand
scanners literally all day. And so of course, when we pushed
the button, they were ready. - Let's go.
- Holy... That was their fastest one, ever. Yes. And so they went to bed. But little did they know, it was now past
midnight, which meant it was a new day. And all we had to do was
wait for them to fall asleep. They were literally asleep,
and it took them two seconds. They didn't fall for it, but I knew that at some point they
were going to have to use the bathroom. So I waited for the moment
when they got as far away from the scanners
as possible. Rayne, Rayne, the alarm. Nice. Nice dude, you came down there flying. All right. I think we can
afford one bathroom break. Excuse me. - Yes. 
- Get back over here. Don't you dare Get back over here. Don't you take a step farther, Hugo. Hugo. Come on, come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on, come. That took five seconds. Dang it, that's slow. You're not allowed
to use the restroom anymore. I really want that to be the only five second alarm
that we get from now on. So no using the restroom tomorrow? We're just going to have to hold it
until the alarm goes off. I'm going to paint a line on the
ground, so that way he knows his limits, how far he can go,
how far he can't go. Here's the line. Rayne's bathroom rule 
might have been intense, but for the next few days, the rule actually kept Hugo on track
for every day's alarm. But on day 98, Hugo started
slipping into old habits. Hugo! Hugo! Come on, come on, come on, 
come on, come on. - How long did that take?
- 6.01. Hugo, you went over the six
second time limit. I mean, I ran as fast as I could. The longest amount of time
that we've taken to turn off these alarms
is because you're in the bathroom. Do you not see a problem?
Do you not see it? Am I no longer allowed 
to use the bathroom ever? Hugo, - don't play with it.
- But I'm not playing with it. I'm just peeing. And through all the tension, Hugo took the next opportunity
to speak his mind. Rayne is showering and this is the last time I have time 
to tell you how I feel about her. Unfiltered. It obviously hasn't been easy
because she was a stranger first, and we are two completely separate
people. Seriously, I wouldn't choose
another partner to do this with. I'm grateful I was put in here with someone
who wants to win as bad as she does, and someone that really pushes me
to just be the best every day. Hey dude, that was nice of you. You weren't supposed to hear that. I really appreciate that, though. Like, we have gotten a lot closer
throughout this challenge, and... Both of our just determination to win, Yeah. As much as I did at the beginning, 
we were like, like, brushing each other off, like,
not really listening. Once we got to know each other, it wasn't us
wanting to just win anymore. It was like, I'm going to win this
for you - And  you're going to win it for me.
- I'm going to win this for you. Happy day 100. I'm heading down for the last time. Unless someone nukes our country 100 days. All for this. You both ready? - Dude! Yeah.
- We're ready. - You sure? 
- We're ready. Karl! Yes? Press the button. Dude. - You ready?
- The final button press. All right, y'all
take a little too long. - Yeah!
- Yeah! Let's go, let's go, let's go. Yeah, come on, come on. Ready? Come on, Hugo. Don't mess this up. Hugo, come on. All right. Yes! It's been a hundred days. Go on up. This is crazy. This is their first time seeing 
the sun in 100 days. Yes! God. Oh, my God. I missed you guys so much. Yes. As promised, here's
your 350 grand. And Rayne, here is your 350 grand. I'll see you around."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SNThp0YiU4,"50 YouTubers Fight For $1,000,000",2487,20240713,en,"- I've gathered 50 of the
biggest YouTubers on the planet. And whichever one lasts
the longest in this cube wins that million dollars
for their subscribers. Never before seen in YouTube history, 1 billion subscribers worth of YouTubers are competing for $1 million. And the rules are simple. All right, point the camera
down, close the line. - Oh!
- Okay. So if you step on the red line, you lose your subscribers
a million dollars. So be careful. Last to leave wins it all. - Like, bro, I
watched the ""Squid Games"" like reality show, it's like... - I feel like I'm just a target. - People are not
going to be friends in this box. - There's no way.
- This is our money, bro. - This is real USD. - I'm pumped, bro. - You finally made in a video.
- Finally. - The best strategy is
to just conserve energy, think about that million dollar pot. - Between us, would you
eliminate someone else so you could stay in? - For my subscribers, of course. - Yeah, yeah.
- No, no, no. Get out, no, no, no, no. Get off me. - JJ, so you know the
more enemies you make, the higher the chance
they might eliminate you. - Oh no, no, we're just goofing around. - Yeah, we are just having fun. - He's literally hiding behind the money. I don't think he got
the goofing around memo. Look at all the YouTubers
laughing and having a good time. By the end of this video, that's not going to be the case. This video is absolutely
the most brutal... - I hate you, Jimmy. - Cutthroat piece
of content you've ever seen these creators in. And the first challenge starts right now. Pull the curtain. You guys are not ready for this. - Whoa! - What the?
- Oh my God. - For challenge number one, you can temporarily walk out of the cube and attempt a free throw. If you make the shot, we will
give a subscriber of yours a free cybertruck and you'll be allowed
back in the challenge. But if you miss, your
subscriber gets nothing and you are eliminated. - How did they get this many
cybertrucks in one place? - I cannot make that shot. - It's too risky. - Free throw is so easy. - A free throw is easy. - I could not make a free
throw to save my life. - Everyone was on the edge trying to decide if the
first challenge was worth it. But then Mark Rober did this. - Jimmy, peace. - No! - I'm doing it. - No way. - Look at all the YouTubers
in the background. - Oh man, this is pressure. - This is a subscriber.
- What's your name? - Matthew. - Don't let him down.
You got to make this happen. - I got faith in you. - It's on you, Mark. - Go Mark.
- Are you going to win your biggest fan a cybertruck or are you both leaving with nothing? - No.
- Oh man. - No.
- Oh. - I'm so sorry.
- It's okay. - As devastating as that was, Jidion decided that maybe
he could do a little better. Cybertruck on the line. Oh. Not like this. - That was so bad. - What was that? You tried. - I think I
definitely lost a subscriber. - Guys, this is my moment. I am a basketball YouTuber. - If you go out there,
I'll go out there, too. - All right, I'm out. Hey, I'm next. - Dude, I'm going to go with you. - Gentlemen, here's your biggest fans. You got a lot of pressure. - I can't watch this, I can't watch it. - Jesser, are
you going to let down your biggest fan? - Yes.
- Let's go, yeah. - Congrats on the cybertruck. We got more shots. - Thank you, Jesser. - However, not
everyone was so fortunate. - I'm sorry. I couldn't get you this cybertruck. Devastating. - Will FazeRug's fan
be taking home a cybertruck or will we have yet another loss? - Come on, bro.
- Come on. - Let's go, he did it.
- Oh my God. - Let's go. - Bro, I love you. - Dude, I love you too. We back. - And after seeing
three massive YouTubers lose this challenge, it was clear, nobody else wanted to try it. So in the meantime, I let all
the YouTubers get settled. - Well, that's a pro there. - But it wouldn't be long until being settled
turned into being bored, bored enough to literally be stupid. I don't know why he is doing this, but he's technically not out yet. He has not touched the red. We'll check the footage. Did he touch it? Oh, yeah. - No. - So far, four YouTubers
have left the cube and we need one more to leave before we can start the next challenge. The challenge two will begin
when one person gets out. - Help, help! Stop. - Take it, take it and go.
- Nice. I'm making out like a bandit, Pokimane. Can I take my jacket with me? - Of course.
- Okay. - Okay.
- Bye. Goodbye and then there is 45. I'm going to go prep the second challenge. I'll be back. And by prep, I mean
sweep up the giant pile of a million real dollars
scattered on the floor. - Yo, MrBeast
sweeping money is a crazy shot. - MrBeast is literally
wiping money off of a floor. I don't know what to tell you about this. - And now that all
the money has been cleaned up, are you guys ready for
the second challenge? Alright, I'm going to
need you all to stand up. You'll notice there are dots in groups of five on the floor. So naturally, I need
all of you to split up into groups of five. And on top of that, elect a
team captain for your group, who will be granted immunity
for this next challenge. That's all I will say. Have fun picking teams. - This is crazy. - We have to split into groups of five. If we're against each other,
I'm going to be so sad. - Okay, so let's do us five. - We are in true overthinker fashion. Overthinking this challenge. - Are you five going to be a group? - Yeah.
- Okay, who's going to be the captain? - We're deciding, Jimmy. - Have you picked a captain yet? - It's Jack.
- For some reason. - Marques.
- Marques? - How can you not trust Marques? He's the most trustworthy
tech reviewer online. - You can pick the captain, please? - That's up to you guys. I want no say. How are you guys going
to pick your captain? We already chose. - Who? Sketch, you trust him with your life? - I trust him. I trust him fully. - All right, you'll notice my henchmen are bringing in tables for
each of the team captains. And what's on these tables
might look a little familiar. - Oh no, I know what it is. - Yes, come on the other side. Captains, I want you to lift the cloth and reveal the next challenge. You have four cookies. - Oh, my god. - I'm freaking out. - And each captain has to decide which YouTuber on their
team will cut each cookie. - Oh my...
- If they break it, they're eliminated. - No.
- And if it wasn't already obvious, depending
on which cookie you get, this is either going to be
really easy or almost impossible. Niko, it's time to hand out some cookies. - This is the worst day
of my life, honestly. - What are you handing Sketch? - No, there's no way. - This is crazy. - There's no way you would do it. - This is crazy. - There's no way.
- I can do the star. - There's no way you would do it. - Oh, my goodness. - He killed it.
- Wow. - Niko, his blood is on your hands. - Oh, my god. - Niko. - Oh, my god. - But the captains still
had eight more umbrellas to hand out. - Umbrella is going to Michael. - How'd you end up with umbrella? - I said I could do it.
- I trust him. - Okay.
- Give me that umbrella, sir. - Appreciate you.
- Umbrella. - I took it for the team. - You're giving him the umbrella? - Fede. - I believe in you. Godspeed. Oh no, how'd you end up with the umbrella? - Bad luck.
- You got it, you got it, you got it, you got it. - Lexi got the umbrella. - I got the umbrella. I'm confident. - It's a cruel world. - I'm so sorry. - Bro. - Pokimane, I believe in you. You are her. This is your time. This is your moment. Let everyone know that
you're that proud... - Start the timer. Alright the 10 minute counter has begun. If you don't carve the shape out, obviously you'll be eliminated. - I thought being team captain would mean I could do a challenge
to help my team win. Turns out I skip the challenge
and punished my team. - I got the triangle. - It tastes really good, though. - Easy peasy, 10 minutes is a long time. - And that's
what I thought as well, but it took a solid chunk of
time before this happened. - Yes, yes, yes! Come on Sketch!
Come on Sketch! - But not everyone had it so easy. Like Logan Paul with the star and Pokimane with the hardest of them all. - It cracked down the middle. - I'm so sorry. Pokimane, I'm sorry. - Because the umbrella had just obliterated Pokimane, the others took notice
and were more cautious with their umbrellas. - Sketch, you
have to be careful, yeah? Take your time. Take your time. - But the people
with simpler shapes were showing a lot more progress. - Riku got the star, let's go. - Yeah. - Yes. - Let's go. - Oh, my God, my team rules. - Come on, let's go, guys. Let's go. - Logan, that might be the most
disgusting cookie out here. - Bro, you're making me do this, bro. I'm trying to win a million
dollars for the Logang. - Nice, nice, nice. - Y'all got it boys. Good stuff. - I'm like shaking, man. - Yes, yes, Sketch. Yes, yes, yes. - No! - My first fallen soldier. - No guys.
- Done. - Oh, I got it.
- Got it. - Ah! Oh, that's disgusting. I hate you, Jimmy. - All right, hey, wait. Hey, really quick, really quick. - I'm good. - Hey, that's where it's going to mess up. This is where people crack. - Oh no!
- Oh. - You did this. - Just heard a piece of change. - What happened? - He betrayed me. - Sketch, you trust him with your life? - I trust him. I trust him fully. - I'm really sorry
- You gave the guy with the worst eyesight,
with the worst hands the worst thing. - I'm sorry, brother.
- And with that, the second challenge has
eliminated Colby and Rugs, Michael Reeves, Fede,
- It's okay, bro. - Ossy,
- Thank you, thank you. - Lexi and Matpat. - Not again. - Right, again. The true million was the
friends we made along the way, and that's no theory. Retirement begins. - He just bring retired. And we also lost Jschlatt,
Pokimane and Mastu, and lastly, of course, Sketch. Thanks for coming up.
- It's a pleasure, thank you so much. - Are you going to dab him up? - Oh.
- Oh. - Later bro. Love y'all.
- 11 people were eliminated, 34 of you remained, congrats. - You are an evil man, MrBeast. There was some beloved
people that were taken. I'm happy they're gone,
every single one of them because it means my odds are better. Now, the herd has been
thinned and I'm going to win. - And while setting
up the next challenge, I let the 34 remaining
YouTubers entertain themselves. - We can play a game. How close can you get to that line, bro? - We can do that with bottle caps. - That's right,
the device that entertains your favorite creators are bottle caps. - Oh, whoa.
- Whoa. - Hey, watch this, watch this. - Not going to think about it. - Wow!
- No way! Oh my God! No way! - It's him, he's him.
- Lebron, Lebron. - All right, that's enough of that. For challenge three, I need
you all in groups of two and duct tape your hands together. Be careful who you pick as your partner. - I was best man at his wedding. So, we're riding together. - All right, let's do it, Andrea. - Are we locking it in? - Hell yeah, I think we're locking in. - For some reason,
everyone just paired up with their closest friends. - They think that they're
going to be teammates. - Which, let's be honest, is not the best strategy
in a MrBeast video. - Do we have to hold hands
or am I just doing this? - You don't have to hold hands - Oh, sorry, sorry. - Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo. Yo, why am I with him, he's crazy! - Now that everyone has a
partner, update the floor. Go ahead and bring it on in. Whoever you're duct taped
to, we will cut you loose and you'll be going
head-to-head in giant Jenga. - This is so stressful. - I hate Jenga. - No, we got this, we got this. - You've been laughing
nonstop this whole time. So I think it makes sense
for you to go first. The tape is off. Let's see who's going home. Oh, imagine it falls on the first one. Okay, he's not done until
he puts the block on top. Now, obviously the plan for giant Jenga was to be a more extreme
version of the game. But the tower was getting so tall, they couldn't even reach
the top with the ladder. - Oh, that is the most rickety
ladder I've seen in my life. - And because
there was now a limit to how high the tower could go, eventually they would run
out of possible moves. - This might be the
final move right here. - That was literally the last possible block to pull. So JJ, you've ran out of luck. What are we doing here? - It's been a pleasure, bro. - Oh no.
- Whoa. - No, surely not. - Savage. - An hour and a half Jenga game for that. - I'm speechless.
I don't know what's going on. - He lost and then he took me out. That is insane. - I'm going to let you all vote if you think it was fair or
not that JJ carried him out. Go to the right side
if you think it's fair, go to the left if you think it isn't. - I wish there was more
evil people on that side. - Not fair, not fair. - No fair man, no fair. - The people have spoken. With KSI out and AJ back
in, 33 of you still remain. - You said that was fair? - Yeah, so that's a game. I'm about to... - Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo. - I'm just saying, bro, that's the game. - Team Prime, we got this. Logan, smash this. - Because that
last game took hours and I can't pull these
YouTubers hostage forever, we pivoted to normal Jenga. I messed up. Pull your first block. - Let's do this.
- Okay. - Immediately the games began and we're moving quickly and soon, things started to get competitive. - There's no way. You're so crazy. - Oh yo. - Are you kidding me? - But suddenly something
unexpected happened. Oh, what the? - Niko's got a great video
idea, if he wins this. So I want him to go out there
and actually give it a try. - Because of the
way this challenge works, some of these creators
accidentally paired themselves with their closest allies and therefore... - He was the best man at my wedding. He flew 27 hours to be here. - Were even willing
to sacrifice themselves for their friends. - I'm going to cry, bro.
- Oh my God. - This is how the UK does it. You got to do it for your boys. - You got to be selfless, man. - You got to just say, you know what? Let them play. - By this point, the
towers had gotten so big... She can't pull from the top two. Oh! That even breathing on them the wrong way would cause them to collapse, costing the loser subscribers $1 million. - No, that wasn't even close. - It's impossible. - That was fun. - It's done for me. Jenga got me. - Yep, wait, wait. - And upon
elimination, after elimination. - Well played. - After elimination,
we were coming down to the end of this challenge. - It hit me in the lip. I'm earning this million to fans. I mean, brother, you've got one move. Dude
- No problem. - Logan, he flew here
all the way from India and you eliminated him. - It was very fun, man. - What do you think about
us passing T Series? - Whoever crosses, I think
it's for the YouTube community. Whoever is the first
needs to be respected. - Let's go.
- I've been watching since 2014. - All right, you know what? - I am very happy - Oh, now I wish you would've won. The last tower standing
was without a doubt, the most competitive game we had. Pull that bad boy. These two were at it for
more than two hours longer than the rest of the YouTubers. - That's crazy. Oh. No, no, no. - You got it, yo. - No.
- No, no, no, no. - Challenge three is officially over. And with that, let's bring in the beds. Okay, everyone has beds. We'll see you in the morning
for the fourth challenge. And that concludes the first
24 hours of this challenge. And I'm going to be honest,
it's actually pretty crazy. All these YouTubers are
just casually sleeping next to $1 million in cash. And by the end of this video, it could quite literally be yours. - Hey, yo. Good morning, Logang. What's popping? - Oh my God, that takes me back. I'm getting tingles, bro. - Ohayo. - Ohio? - It's good morning. - Ohayo. - Time to lock in and do
it for the subscribers. - Good morning.
- Good morning. - I have a surprise for all of you. - Is it our families? - It's better than your families. - Oh, no. - And for those of you who don't know
who my friend Speed is,  he's one of the largest creators on the entire planet. And he was supposed to be
here over 24 hours ago. However, Speed's plane just
landed, he's ridiculously late. And I wanted to give you guys the option if you wanted to allow
him in and play alongside one of your fellow creators? Or if you want him just to hop back on the plane and head out. It's up to you guys.
- Yeah. - In this community,
we're about inclusion and- - No, we're not.
- No, we are not. - I will be pissed. - He knows nothing about life-size Jenga. - He hasn't suffered. - Oh, come on bro. Look at that mullet on him. - He's already barking, man. - I think it's time. Go on the left if you want him in. Go on the right if you don't. - We all do it together. - Get back on that plane. I have no idea what's going on. - All right, it's final. Speed, they don't want you here. - All right. - This won't be
the last time you see him. - So you all going to get out. I remember all you all faces. - Should have thought about that. - Now we're doomed. - And with that, bring
in the fourth challenge. - Is it just Speed again?
- Oh, no. - Bring them on in. - Deal or no deal. - Almost immediately,
everyone began to pick up on what the next challenge was. - What do you
think is in the briefcase? - Eliminated and staying boxes. - Bring out Howie Mendel, please. - And considering the
last time we played this game, it was such a massive fan favorite, I knew we not only had
to bring back the game, but also the face of
the game one more time. - Howie, Howie, Howie. - Jimmy. - Bro, it's been a while. - Wow, it's like I'm live scrolling. - I need whoever has the most
subscribers to come up here. Who has the most? - Don't even look at me. - Logan, I guess you have the most. Before I explain the rules,
you have to pick a competitor. - I gotta go with you, Sam. - All right. I now need you to pick a briefcase. Any number. - I'll go with lucky number 11. - Seven of these
briefcases say eliminated. The rest are safe. Logan is going to look
inside the briefcase and then Sam is going to have to decide does he want to steal
it or let Logan keep it. - In the classic game
of Steal Or No Steal. - There you go, Howie's a natural. - He said the thing. - This case is not safe. - Oh, dang. - Do you trust what he's saying? - I don't. - I would steal.
- Really? - Steal or no steal? - I'm going to go with steal. - You're going to steal it. Did Sam make the right choice? - Oh my God. - I'm sorry, Sam. - The Sam and Colby channel
is now officially eliminated. - And now that Logan's
case has been stolen, he will continue to play until someone doesn't steal his case. Who do you want to go up against now? - Kai.
- Kai. What number do you want, Logan? - Lucky number seven. Let's go, Kai. - I want to make sure no
one can see what's in this. - Kai, look at me. Also not safe. - Oh, not safe? - You think he's being honest? - I'm going to go with steal. Let me tell you why. - Oh, didn't even ask him anything. - Growing up I've been watching Logan since he started YouTube. I know how he acts in certain situations. You can't fool me, bro. - You're that confident. - This briefcase, how you open this? It is... Safe. - He read Logan like a book. - Oh my God.
- Wow. - My heart is racing so fast right now. Ludwig. - You want me, baby?
- It's you, it's you. - For this one, Logan, because you said your heart was racing, do you mind putting on
this Samsung Galaxy ring? - I don't mind. - I want to measure your heart rate. And Luddy, do you mind
putting this ring on? - Yeah, no worries. - We'll be able to see it in real time. Yeah, that's right. We're going to use the
Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 to track the player's heart rates as they try to bluff each other. Logan's 106 right now. Ludwig's 87. - Regardless of what I see in here, I'm going to ask you to keep this case. - Ludwig's getting a bit stressed. - I got a little stressed out when he started to do
something to keep stuff. - Surely the best move here
is just to let him have it. There's too much to guess. - I didn't even see it. Can I keep it? - What is happening in your own heart? - Karl, actually, what is happening there? - It's going crazy,
I'm going to be honest. - It's at 103 right now, Howie. - Okay, this one word will
change the life of a follower. a million dollars. - He's good.
- He's doing the thing. - Steal or no steal? - No steal. - Logan Paul is... Safe. - I'm ready, I'm ready. There's only one case for me. - I know, case 14. - We don't even have to
look at it. I want it. I'm stealing it. I traveled 27 hours to be here. - Let's see if it was all for nothing. - Oh my God, oh my God. - There's your lucky case. - 27 hours. - It's nice seeing the
eliminated cases go. - This is so heartbreaking. - Just don't hit a
kangaroo on your way home. - I don't like you, Nolan. - And the brutality of these cases didn't stop there. No steal. Because the most brutal was yet to come. Oh my gosh. - I feel stabbed, I do. - Yeah, that was crazy. - I don't want to lie. - You don't want to look at her
in the eyes when she opens it? - Oh god, it says eliminated. - I can't do this, it's too hard.
- You think she's telling the truth? - I think she's acting. - Steal or no steal? - Steal. - She's smiling. - What did she just do? Holy crap, her heart rate got up to 152. - She's a demon. - And even though she was lied to, Valkyrae wasn't afraid to start
playing that game herself, with only two eliminates
and three safes left. So now she has another
chance to be deceptive. - What I just watched, I'm shocked. - That's crazy. - Can't trust anyone anymore. - You look concerned. - Last time she was crying. Now, she's the happiest
I've ever seen her. - This is crazy. - It is safe.
- So I ask you, steal or no steal? - I am going to steal. I'm going to let the audience react. - Three, two, one. - Oh my god. - She's good. - These are the four
remaining contestants. Only two safes and two
elimination remains. - I'll do it. - While she's grabbing
her briefcase, Marques, what do you think of the
Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6? - Oh, it's convenient you
picked me for this one. It looks pretty good. - Anyways, let's get back to this. - If you want to monitor
your own heart rate and track your steps, check
out the Samsung Galaxy ring and the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6. - Do you want
what's in that case? - No. - She wants it, she wants it. - I feel like the last two, it seemed like you pushed
a safe pretty quickly and I don't think you'd do
that three times in a row. No steal. - You read me like a book. - There is only one eliminated left. - You were my team captain. I trust you. - I got the last eliminated. - If they had trust, he would
show her the case right now. - I don't think he's telling the truth. - Steal or no steal? - Okay, no steal. - If this says eliminate,
they both move on. Can you trust MKBHD? - He doesn't know how to lie. And these were the two
that weren't chosen. Go ahead and open them. They both will be safe. And after that blood bath,
these 10 are what remain and only one of them can
win their subscribers the million dollar prize. - I don't feel good. - I can't do this, bro. I can't barely move, bro. - This is where the game kind of gets hard 'cause now we got to eliminate
our new acquaintances and that kind of sucks. - It's now time for the fifth challenge. Switch the floor. There are five pairs of two dots. I once again, need you all
to pair up in groups of two and this time, you'll be working together. - Do you want to do the risk? I'm down, I'm down. - We got this? - We got this. - Kai, you trust this
man with a million bucks? - That's my brother. - I trust Kai. - Why you two? - The female bond. - You two have
been getting along well? - Yeah, because all my friends are out and he speaks French. - All right,
Karl, blindfold them all. - I'll see you on the other side. - I'll see you on the other... - It's dark here.
- Now that everyone is blindfolded, bring in the set. - Hey bro, hey bro. - This room is being
transformed right now. - I lean to my left,
there is something hard. - No. - What do you think's going on? - I smell a bit of gas. I touch it here, it's cloth. - Yeah. - Jimmy, is this an apron?
- Hey, stop touching things. - I asked you. - All right, everybody,
remove your blindfold. - No.
- Oh, my God. - As I'm sure
you all pieced together, this is a team cooking challenge. - Let's go baby. Let's go baby. Let's go baby. - I am terrified. I can't cook. - Bro, how'd you end up with Nick? - He said it. - That's crazy. - I'm cooked. - You've cooked before?
- No, I'm cooked - with this challenge.
- Oh he's cooked. - The best things I cooked
is eggs, toast and cereal. - We've been on a cooking
team before, and we lost. - We have., we've been
on a cooking team before - and we lost.
- So you have some experience. - No, we did bad.
- We did bad. - Just don't do that again. We will be bringing in three judges. They'll rate all your meals
on a scale of one to 10. The three teams with the
highest ratings move on, the two teams with the lowest
ratings are eliminated. Bring out our first judge, Joey Chestnut. - No way, Joey. - What better man to judge your food than the literal best eater on the planet? He broke so many food world records that Guinness gave him world record of breaking the most world records. And now for our second
judge, Miranda Cosgrove. - Oh my God.
- ""iCarly""? - I'm losing my mind. - Kai was excited about that one. - I was excited, bro. - Our third and final
judge, bring him on out. He needs no introduction, IShowSpeed. - Oh my God. - We're screwed.
- Watch this, that's all I got to say. - The time has officially started. You guys can cook anything you want. This time is going to go by
way faster than you think. On top of that, your dish
will be judged on taste, creativity and presentation. The race has begun. Let's see what they whip up. - In ""iCarly"", her older
brother Spencer loved the spaghetti tacos. Spaghetti tacos with the... - What are you two making? - We are making a Cordon
Bleu, which is a French dish. - What are you two making? - Chocolate cake, some mac and cheese. - Okay?
- That hurts, that hurts, that hurts, that hurts. - I'm trying to do a Spanish tortilla and he's trying to do fried rice. Clashing two countries together to make - A war?
- A war in their mouth. - Oh my gosh, this looks good already. There's just onions and some spices. This man was mentored by Gordon Ramsey. So basically there's only
four slots besides these two. - It's going to be so
embarrassing if the two women get eliminated for cooking. No, it's not because
women do more than cook. - So for dessert, we're making chocolate
covered strawberries. - I'm really hungry, can't wait to eat.
- And I hear her stomach is like - Get ready to
put everything down. - Okay, okay, please, please, please. Oh, okay, it looks good. - Joey loves cheese? Yo, yo, yo, bro, you got
to hold the sandwich. - A million dollars is riding on this. Three, two, one, stop what you're doing. The time is officially up. They're going first. - What we're eating tonight
is a French Cordon Bleu. - I actually like this. - Yeah, the asparagus are good. - Whenever you judges are ready. - I'll start. - This was really good.
- Whoa, whoa a nine. Whoa, whoa, these are high numbers. Whoa, your total score was 26. - All right. - Are you guys ready? - That was a little intimidating but... - Bring it on up.
- All right. We wanted to go with a
American comfort food. - I don't want to hype y'all
up until I've tasted it. - Of course.
- But...  I think this going to taste all right. - Really good mac and cheese.
- Amazing. - Joey, when you're ready. - Joey.
- It was delicious. I love them. - Speed, based on that reaction, I assume you're gonna
give something lower? - Miranda, you go. - Nine. - Yes. Thank you. - Are you about to cry? Don't do this to me. - Hey, don't manipulate. - Don't, no.
- Speed, vote based on the food. I need you to turn around. Speed, hey, hey, focus. - That's fair, that's fair. - That is also a 26. - You're tripping, bro, a 10? You can't just pass out 10 like that because you like to eat, bro. - There you go. - Welcome to Kai and AJ's - Ratatouille.
- Bodega. - First thing's up, Miranda.
- Oh yeah. - We have the famous, the one and only, Spencer's spaghetti tacos. - Wow. - That's pretty creative. - That's pretty awesome. - AJ.
- Yeah? - Who do we have in the middle? - IShowSpeed.
- IShowSpeed. Who is the best football
player of all time? - Cristiano Ronaldo.
- Ronaldo. Ronaldo pasta just for you. - Don't tell him too much. - Now listen. - Don't tell him too much. - Last but not least, Joey. Bring out the tower of records. - Records tower. - When you eat it, you can feel it. Oh my gosh. Oh my God. - I don't know guys. I don't think I'm going to finish this. - You're good, you're good. Are you hungry, you just
came up a good stream. You busting that down, boy. - Bro, so good, bro.
- Wait, wait, wait. Really? - All right.
- Miranda. - It's a solid spaghetti taco. - I love the show, but
at the end of the day, - it's about the food.
- It's about the food. Okay, three, two, one, reveal it. There we go. All right, take it away. - We made a creamy
chicken, tomato pasta. - This was a dessert
inspired by my father. He's not here with us... like in this room,
he's still very much alive. - Oh, dog. It's like exquisite, you know? There's like a lemon punching me. - There's the meat. - It's meat punching me. It's good, I don't wanna eat too much. - Yeah, here,
I'll remove this fourth. - Got to say Feastables and
strawberries taste amazing. - It's very good, right?
- Yeah, you should go to Walmart and buy it right
now, whoever's watching this. - I'll do it right after this. - I wanna eat more of it. - I really liked it, that's
something that I'll order- - Speed not to cut you off,
but that's officially above 16, which means these two
have now been eliminated. Gentlemen, Miranda
doesn't even need to vote. - You guys are gone.
- No way. - Bye. - I'm sorry, but it's over. All right, what was your rating? - 10.
- A 10. Almost a perfect score. - Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait, One time for the one time, please?
It's been so long. - Wait, you just left. - What are you doing? What are you doing? - I couldn't resist throwing a plate. That was a complete mistake. I forgot all about the line. I saw the plate, I was
like I need to smash it. It took me back to 2017- - Yeah, when you used to
smash plates in your vlogs. - Don't! - Would it make you feel better
if I let you promote Prime on your way out? - Sure. Prime the fastest growing
beverage in history available at Walmart, Target. Oh, I'm shocked, but also not. I hope Jimmy invites me back. - When he first ran out, I
was like, oh, that's funny. - You know what's crazy? Is this cube doesn't feel like the cube with the kitchen set up. - Yeah.
- So I can see how maybe he was like- - With this table here too? - It feels so different. - Yeah, this setup is insane. - And now for the final meal. - This is a traditional Spanish tortilla. - Not bad.
- Yeah. - Judges, are you ready to reveal it? - Yeah.
- yes. - Three, two, one, reveal. - Okay, okay, okay, it's okay. - That adds up to 22, which
means you two are eliminated. - Okay. It's been a pleasure. - And with that, five contestants remain. Congratulations. One of you will win a million
dollars for your subscribers. It's going to be crazy. - With a million dollars, I'm
going to do a find me and win a bunch of money challenge. - I want to use a lot of
it to donate as many meals as I possibly can. - We'll host Some really cool
chess events for our subs. - I would really like to pay for a lot of people's like art degree. - I'd like to build
schools in South Morocco. It could change a lot of lives. - The final five. - Yeah, baby. - When we started, here's
what the cube looked like and now everyone literally
fits in the money. Now, before we do the last challenge, if you all look over
here, open the curtains. These are real play
buttons made by YouTube. - Whoever wins,
we will also give you every play button of everyone who competed
in this tournament. - What?
- Wow. - What? That's crazy. - It's like when you collect
the heads of people you killed. - Yeah, exactly. All right, bring in the final challenge. At the beginning of each round, everyone will start off blindfolded as I shuffle these five briefcases. Four have nothing in it, one has a million dollar
check inside of it. Take your blindfolds off, come grab a briefcase and
take them back to your podium. All right, everyone look
inside your briefcase. And now that everyone
knows what they have, everyone will cast a vote to eliminate one player from the game. If that player's case is
empty, they're eliminated. If you guys happen to vote
for the player with the money, the game is over and
that YouTuber walks away with the million dollars
for their subscribers. This is a game of bluffing and how well you can read each other. Which one of you has the best poker face? Start the timer. One of you can win a million dollars in the next few minutes. - Right out the gate, I'm pretty confident it's one of these two. - The women?
- Yeah. - Why? - Your facial expressions. - He's a little bit aggressive, no? - He's taking charge. Is he taking charge because he has $0 and he's scared to be voted off? - Could be. - This is tense. - I so far think she has
the million, to be honest. - She's the most confident
but trying to mask it. - She has the million. - Do you? - I have the million. - So you're saying you
have the million dollars? - I have a million dollars. - Okay. - I feel confident that you don't. - What makes you say that? - 'Cause I know she has zero
and wants to stay in longer. - You think her briefcase says $0 and she's lying, so
you won't vote for her. - She wants to make sure that
she stays in another round, but it does not say a million. - Less than five minutes
till you all have to decide. - If I didn't know what everybody had, I think it's best to vote as alliances. We were teammates, we were teammates, your teammate ran out. So the easiest thing
would be to vote Nick out and then we all have a better chance, if I was playing with no information. - Okay, but you do have info. - So who do you want to vote?
- You guys should vote me. - Then we should vote you?
- I would like to win. - I think voting Alex is beast. I'm comfortable doing it. I know she doesn't have the million. - That's ballsy. - Everyone here has been very cool and so I'm going to play it by the game and she's lied in this game. - I have the million. If I've lied in the game, wouldn't someone else have also lied? - Yeah, but I know you've lied. - That's risky for the first game, no? - Yeah, you have to take some risks
to win a million dollars. - If the risk is wrong, she wins it. You guys should go ahead
and start writing down, who are you voting for? All right, let's see who you voted for. Our first vote is for Jaiden Animations. - I didn't even do anything. - That was out of left field. - That was surprising. - Our second vote is for Ludwig. Our third vote is for Amixem. Our fourth vote is Jaiden. - Dude, I didn't-
- And the final vote is Ludwig. - Whoa, so it's a tie. - Since we have a tie, we're
adding a minute on the timer. You three will get to hear
them plead their cases, and then have to revote. Explain why they should or
should not vote for you two. - I didn't think we were voting for me. - Well, you would've voted for yourself if you had the million. I think you voted for yourself. - No. - That means Ludwig voted for himself. That means he has it, if this is true. - Who do you think I voted for? - I think you voted for him. - I voted for Ludwig. - Yeah, so did I. - I voted for Jaiden. - Jaiden, who did you vote for? - Him. - You voted for him?
- Sorry, this is a no-brainer. - Wait, wait, then you said so did I. - All right, timer hit zero. It's now up to you three to break the tie. Our first vote, Ludwig. How does that make you feel? - Read the second one. - I want to know how that
first one made you feel. - I would like for you to read the second. I think it's going to be good. - The second one is Jaiden. - Oh man, dude. - What? - Shaking again. - The person who is opening
up their briefcase is Ludwig. If this says a million
dollars, the video is over. If it says $0, we do another round. - It's been a pleasure, guys. It is not. - You went beast mode though. - I knew you bluffed. - Gg's.
- With Ludwig now eliminated, he joined the rest of the fallen soldiers in our viewing room to watch
the rest of the challenge. The second round starts once again with everyone blindfolded. We then reshuffled and
the remaining players picked their briefcases. You guys know what to do. Start the 10-minute timer. - Jaiden, did you get a mill again? - But she said you had the million. - And she said she had zero. So everybody's lying, but there's
three people who have zero who are going to need to
work together to figure out who has a mill. - Yeah.
- Did anybody see anything? Any body language? - You're the only one that
gave different body language. - You were much more animated.
- Yeah. - Do you have anything? - I have a suitcase. - You could also be trying to
get the pressure off of you - to try to vote me out.
- Absolutely. Absolutely. - I know it's not me. I don't think it's you. - So the million is here or here for you? - Yeah, most likely I think it's you. - You think he has it? - Our first real claim. You're saying he has the
million dollar briefcase. - As of right now, I think he
has the million dollar briefcase. - Who are you voting for? - It's valuable info. You vote for someone,
they vote for themselves. It's two of the four votes. - I haven't decided. - I don't know, for me it's
a 50/50 between you two. - Oh, I could vote for you, yeah. - Me?
- Yeah, because that's just a matter of statistics, probability. - Like statistically I
shouldn't have it again? - That's an interesting point. - All right, write who you
want to open the briefcase. Up first, we have a vote for Jaiden. Our second vote is for Alex, one on one. Our third vote is also for Jaiden, and our fourth and final vote is Jaiden. If this has a million
dollars, you instantly win. - I think it does. - Oh my gosh. Oh, whoa. You are so chill. I was like, surely she's out. You are the winner. How do you plan on giving
it away to your subscribers? - It's hard for a lot
of artists out there. I just... I'd really like to send a
lot of them to art school. - And there you have it, Jaiden Animations just
won a million dollars for her subscribers. - You have to subscribe!
- Subscribe! Hey, don't let them down. Do it right now. - Subscribe right now.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkCXLABwHP0,I Built 100 Houses And Gave Them Away!,576,20240629,en,"In this video, we are building
and giving away of 100 houses, and each home is going to change
a family's life. Like this family
who didn't have a house to call their own. And they have no idea
we just built them one. Take off your blindfolds and turn around. Behind you is your brand new home. Oh, I was not expecting that reaction. She is freaking out. There's a bedroom!!! I've always wanted him to have a bunk bed. And my dream come true. This is actually just the first
of 100 houses we're giving away. First? I'm glad they're happy. Let's go give away another house. With every single home
we're building in this video, we're improving quality of life
for families who don't have a safe space to call home. And we spend millions of dollars just on this video building these houses. Because here in Jamaica, there are
currently over half a million people living in unsafe,
life-threatening conditions. Like this next family whose house is so unsafe
and unstable it could collapse on them at any moment. - So you built this place?
- Yeah. - By yourself?
- Yeah. I brought boards
and all materials that you see. But we're on top of a mountain. So you carried all this material
up this mountain? - Yep.
- On my head. We knew we wanted to build
this family a house. So we sent them on a trip
so that we had enough time to work with our partners
to build them a brand new home. You're about to witness a family
that lives in this house, go to living in this house. And I cannot wait to see
the look on their faces. Oh my. What you're looking at
is your brand new home. The trip we sent you guys on
was just a decoy so we can have time to build
this brand new house for you. Do you want to see the inside? Come check it out. We noticed that
you might need some new furniture, so we completely furnished your new place. Now, on top of the electricity, you have a water tank for running water. We put bunk beds in this room
for two of the kids. Oh my. And if you go across the hallway,
you'll see your bedroom. - Nice.
- With a little crib. Because I heard you had a newborn. Tyra, that's your crib. It's been really hard.
And you guys changed my life. Here's officially the deed to the house. Thank you guys so much. And it's unfortunate,
but some of the places these families live are extremely unsafe
and in some cases, life threatening. That's where this family currently lives. The mom was telling us that
that roof doesn't work. Whenever the rainfall,
whole place flooded all over here. Her kids get soaked and can't sleep. And as of today,
that will not happen again. We built that brand new home for you. - Here's the keys.
- Oh my God. I got a new house. But of course we couldn't stop there and we were able to build a home
after home for families in Jamaica. And we weren't going to stop
until we had built 100 houses. But unfortunately, at our next
destination, there's a river that destroys hundreds
of homes every year. During rainy season, this river flash
floods washing away all of the homes and anyone unlucky
enough to still be inside. And as you can see, there's literally a fridge right there, which I assume got there
because their house got swept away. Exactly. So you're saying when this floods
those houses that currently have families
living in them are going to be destroyed by this river? Yes, they will. Well, not on my watch
because just a couple miles away, we've built rows of new houses
for this community. No joke. We're giving away this home,
this home, this home, this home, this home,
this home, this home, this home. There's a lot of homes. So we started with Maria and her daughter, whose previous home was
completely demolished by the river and during rainy season. And without even a bed to sleep in, every single
day has been a struggle for them. God has helped me to stay strong. All right, since they don't speak English, Can you translate for them to turn around
and look at your brand new home? Can you turn around? Here is your new house. Oh my God. - Thank you.
- Thank you my beautiful God! Mommy! - Thank you.
- No problem. Come check out the inside.
Oh, you want to give me a hug? Come on. Oh! How beautiful! And while walking through their new home, we realized they didn't even
know the house was free yet. - Oh, you haven't told them it's free?
- No, no. - Yeah. Tell them. It's free.
- You're not gonna pay. All of this is yours. Thank you god! Congrats on your new home. You're crazy for not
telling them it was free. - Can I lay down? -
- Yes, you can lay down. I'm going to sleep. What do you think of it? - Can I give you a hug?
- What'd she say? - Can she hug you?
- Of course. Thank you! This is why we do videos like that. - Look how happy they are.
- I appreciate this with all of my heart. I don't want you to have to worry
about the river anymore. This is your brand new home. Enjoy the new home, little man. We heard they had a newborn,
so we also got him a crib. Son, we have a house. See that row of houses behind me with the family's
blindfolded in front of them? We are not kidnaping the families. We're giving them all houses
at the same time. Eight families
lives are about to change forever. Attention everybody. Remove your blindfolds and turn around and look at your brand new home. Congratulations! For real? It’s free? Thank you for the house, Jimmy! I got to go down.
I need to see the reactions. - What do you think of the new place?
- Thank you. Congrats. Can you ask them
if they like their new house? - Do you like your new house?
- Yes! Yeah. You like the new house? Let's see if they do.
What do you think of it? - Very beautiful! Thank you!
- Thank you! I hope you like it.
And now we're at the end of the row. - What do you think of your new home?
- Very good. Can I get a picture? Yeah, come over here. I have something way
better than just a picture. Can you ask him if he
wants to play football with me? Wanna play soccer with him? - Yeah.
- Well, that's convenient because... not only are we giving
this community houses, but we're also giving them
this giant soccer field. And the best part is, I have
hundreds of kids waiting over here. We're going to surprise them. And this is the neighborhood's first
look at their brand new soccer field. Let's play some soccer. Enjoy your new soccer field. Go have fun. And of course, a new field had to come with brand new soccer equipment
for all the kids. Make sure you guys have a lot of fun
on the soccer field. But I don't know
if the soccer field was enough because all of the kids
started demanding Feastables. Feastables! All right, here's some Feastables. They really love Feastables here.
I will start carrying more Feastables. Feastables is better than Hershey's! I don't know what he said, but if you said it tastes good
that he's correct. But of course, outside of this community, more families across El Salvador
were in need of safe houses. So on our way out, we built
as many houses as we possibly could, but we're only halfway there
because a small community in Argentina needed our help, and we built house after house
to ensure that every single child in this community
had a safe place to learn and grow. But we still weren't done. So we even flew all the way over
to Mexico, where we continued to build house after house
for all of these communities. And when we arrived
in our next destination in Colombia, we found a community whose homes
were ravaged by a brutal windstorm. The next family used to live
in a house like this. I say used to
because a tornado destroyed it. And clearly
these houses are in no way livable. And so of course we built John
and Ana a brand new home. And now all we have to do
is give it to them. This family has no idea they're
about to get that house. Right there is good. Okay, take them off. Congrats. I know it might not seem real,
but this is legitimately your house. You want to unlock the front door? They're all in shock. And to be honest, I don't even think
they believe this is their house. They may not be saying anything,
but the tears say a lot. Congrats man. Congrats. This is yours. It's so big. It’s so big! Before, we only had a
half finished room! We have a home! We have a home! But John and Ana weren't the only ones
that needed help in Colombia. So you probably already know What we did
for the rest of this community. Don't you love it? Look at that smile. It shouldn't be a stretch
that everyone in the world deserves a safe roof over their head. But not every house we built
went quite so smoothly. I accidentally broke the lock to the door. Their furniture's still outside,
which we are going to move in there. The family just pulled up. We put bars on the
window so I can't get in. - I don't really know what to do.
- We're very screwed. All right guys, the family's here.
It looks like we're out of time. No way! Are you serious? Hey, how's it going? Come on over. Okay, so, I don't know,
I think I broke the lock. I can't get the door open. Here, can you try? Maybe I'm just dumb. Oh, what? Wait, how'd you do that? Are we dumb? All right boys, come on in. And while personally,
I'm not quite the best locksmith... Do you want to see it? They totally haven't
seen any of the furniture yet. What mattered most is that Jose and
his family now had a place to call home. You don't have to worry
about a home anymore. And we also heard their only means
of transportation broke down. And so, one more surprise. We also got you guys
a brand new motorcycle. Here you go. - Thank you. Thank you.
- No problem. Yeah. Now they have a brand new home
and way to get around. And this got me thinking. While giving away all these houses, I noticed a lot of people were
struggling with transportation. And I got a solve in this truck. Open it up. We got bicycles for every single
one of the kids in this village. - Thank you, MrBeast.
- No problem, man. - Thank you, MrBeast!
- Thank you, MrBeast! After all of these houses
we built in Colombia, we still had one home left to give away. And finally, house 100. Take your blindfolds off
and look at your new home. - Thank you!
- Congrats. - Oh, congrats.
- Thank you very much. Go check it out. Shout out to all our partners
that helped build these houses. And also shout out to you guys because obviously
if you didn't watch these videos, we wouldn't
have been able to build 100 houses. And if the channel continues to grow,
I hope to do 1000 in the future."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWirijQkH4M,World’s Deadliest Obstacle Course!,1705,20240615,en,"I have built the most
deadly obstacle course in the world, and my friend Mack here is attempting to complete it
without falling 200 feet to the ground. Whenever you're ready, Mack. First jump, he's about to do it. Oh my God, I'm so high up in the air. Look at how much
that platform is shaking. We are currently hundreds of feet
in the air. Look at that. And this is just
the first of many deadly, painful, absolutely insane obstacle courses
Mack will face in this video. And if Mack completes all six of the
obstacle courses coming up. He wins $800,000. That looks insane. I could not do what he's doing right now. Oh my God, that thing almost touched me. He might not even make it past
the first level. Two more jumps. Oh my God. This is the last jump. I don't know if I
can jump that far. And of course, I have to make it
the hardest jump. There's double swinging hammers 
and it's the longest distance. You have this. I don't know if I have it. Mack, 800 grand's on the line. This is going to be a short video, boys. It's scary for me and 
I'm on the stable platform. Yes! Yeah! Don't celebrate too early. That was the easiest 
of the six obstacle courses. Let's go to the next one. Can't get harder than that. Actually, yes it can. Mack has to complete 
all six obstacle courses if he wants to walk away
with $800,000. Mack, are you ready? I don't know. The answer is no, because we're not
hundreds of feet in the air yet. We're going up...? Welcome to level two. As I said before,
this one is much harder. Remove your blindfold. In front of you are two games
you used to play as a child. Balance beam and monkey bars. You just have to pick one of those
and get to this side. Also take your harness off. No, no, no, no. If for whatever reason he fails
this obstacle course, he free falls 100 feet into a net,
just like the first course. and his 800 grand will burn. Jimmy, you gotta chill out, bro. - This is the second one.
- What do you mean? Winning
$800,000 isn't supposed to be easy. God, dude. All right, it looks like he's
choosing monkey bars. This is scary to watch him
climb down. Once he starts dangling on that
first bar, he can't go back. Let's see if he locks 
in the monkey bars. No way. 800 grand on the line. Three. Don't look down. There's no going back. Two. Oh my gosh! Come on Mack! Oh, don't fall Please don't fall. 
Please don't fall. You got it! Bro, this is crazy. I know it might be hard, but look, money. Money's over here. Keep going. Oh, this one's way further. Well, Mark, the further
you go, the harder it gets. Oh, no. Oh my God. Mack, you're almost halfway already. Think of all the other times
you lost. Don't do that to yourself. Mack, if you fall, 
we have to get a new contestant. Oh my gosh. All right, just a couple more. All right.
This one's a big one. It's a big one. He's right here. Oh, this is a crazy shot. Please don't fall. 
He's so close. Oh, my gosh! If you're wondering who 
my psychotic friend Mack is, he's actually a contestant 
from two previous challenge videos. Even though he tragically lost
both of them. He's been a massive crowd favorite,
so I'm giving him one final chance to redeem himself
and win this money once and for all. Welcome to level three. What is this Jimmy? Potentially your worst nightmare. You see, so far in this video,
the obstacle courses have all been about strength,
which you're pretty good at. But this level is going to test
your brain. Press and hold this red button. Okay. As you will see, a pattern
is now popping up on the floor. Wait for this pattern to populate. To move on, 
you'll need to cross this floor. Only stepping on the green tiles. And let go of the button. The catch is you'll be doing it
completely from memory. You have exactly 30 minutes
to memorize the 44 tile pattern perfectly, and if you accidentally
step on one red square, your money is rigged to explode. Here's a riot shield. Oh my gosh! It'll protect you from the bomb. Start the timer. Go for it. And he's off. The rain makes this so much more dramatic. Okay, the first step. Oh. Stop. Don’t! Tell us before you go. I do not need that. - That is not helpful to me.
- I didn't have my riot shield up. Mack, you sure you don't want to come back? No, I... Bro, you can press the button 
as much as you want. If you're not confident in your next step,
you should really. Don't blow up your money. Almost five minutes
have gone by. - I don't need that.
- And you're still at the start. I don't need that. Mack, you've basically done 
a tile a minute so far. Okay, thanks Karl. - And there's more than 30 tiles.
- Okay. All right, here we go. - Okay. 
- How confident are you? - Not 
- That that won't explode the money? I'm not confident. - Okay. 
- And you're going to do it anyways? I'm kind of confident. He's getting deranged. 23 minutes left. As you're questioning
whether or not to take that step. I want to remind you,
this is your final chance to win this 800 grand. If you lose again,
we're not bringing you back. Is it the forward one or 
what do you think? Who are you asking Mack? - Jimmy, I don't know.
- You want me to help you win my money? It's not worth it. It's not worth it. At this point, Mack was navigating
so far into the course that an individual attempt was
costing him at least six minutes, no matter what he tried. He continued to forget
the very end of the pattern. It was down 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, boom. I think this is it. All right. 
This is uncharted territory. I haven't gone this far. You have nine minutes. You can go back and check
if you want. I thought that was it. The only way I could go
from here is forward. I think it's... - Mack?
- Yes. Remember how you felt
when you lost the 700 grand and 800 grand? Frequently, I think about that. So for your sanity, you might want to go
press the button one more time. But it's up to you. Oh, you're going back. This is going to be my last time. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Four. Four. Right. Two. Four. Four.
Right two. Mack spent half his remaining time repeating the pattern over
and over again, hoping that his decision to return to the start
one last time wasn't for nothing. But when Mack was finally confident
enough to give it his last attempt. - Right, two. Okay, this is it.
- All right. He was faced with an extremely tight
deadline. Under four minutes remain. Under four... Oh my God. Mack, I think it's time. Mute everybody out, bro. 
It's just you. - Godspeed. 
- It's you and the tiles. I can literally feel my heart 
pounding right now. This is so intense. He had 30 minutes to do this. There is now less than three minutes. One wrong step
and he loses another 800 grand. Four. Four. Okay Four. Four. This way. One. Two. Three. This is where he got stuck last time. Oh my God. Dude, it's coming down to the wire. I still got time. I still got time. Oh, there's a high probability
of an explosion coming up. All right, Mack, there's 10 seconds left. Wait, I don't know. All right, all right. - Okay! You can just jump!
- Just jump. Jump, jump. There’s no time! 3! 2! Jump! You did it! Yeah. Oh God I'm so happy he's not picking me up. Oh you're right. 
Come here, come here buddy. No. I'm being assaulted. And if Mack did step on a red tile. Anyways,
let's head over to level four. Come on. Now, this next level
may look friendly, but I know for a fact
it's going to obliterate you. This... ... is level four. And even though this course
isn't in the sky, the obstacles you see here... That's a lot ...are almost impossible to accomplish 
in your one and only attempt. So therefore
you have two options. Tell me. You can attempt to do this
monster of an obstacle course, and if you fall in the water,
lose everything. Or you can hold my Feastables chocolate bar and as long as you don't drop it,
get as many attempts as you want. Feastables sounds like the plan. Just don't let go that bar
when you hit the water. What could go wrong? Oh, He literally would have lost
in the first two steps. So it's a good thing he's holding on
to the greatest chocolate on earth. Yeah, we're going to be here all night.
But I don't want to be. So it's about dang time 
he got through the log roll. I just remembered, you're
supposed to be wearing this helmet. Even though you
don't need a helmet to know that Feastables
is the best chocolate, I need you to wear one so you don't
die holding my product on camera. Whatever you do, don't drop 
that Feastables chocolate bar that's available
in every single Walmart nationwide. You can also buy Feastables using 
YouTube shopping at the link below. What is this? There's only one way to find out.
Give it a try. It does not feel possible. Bro, that gap is insane. What is going on? Mack, you want to get onto it. Oh, okay. - Yeah. 
-  Genius. Yeah Mack. Mack seems to be struggling, 
so I'm going to show him how it's done. This is how it's done, Mack. Did you know that Feastables chocolate comes in seven different flavors? Like my favorite one, almond. Jimmy I'm probably going to be joining you 
down there in a second. He did it. I love Feastables chocolate. I'm definitely not taking a break
right now to catch air. Mack, the only thing standing between
you and level five are these not big red balls. I called them that, 
so Wipeout wouldn't sue me. And these balls are so much harder
than the rest of this level that we brought some other creators
to test them out. And let's just say
they didn't do too hot. I'm never gonna die. Disregard everything he just did. Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. So if you don't want your trilogy
to end with balls, you better hold on to that Feastables bar. - Good luck. 
- Three. Two. One. God. All right. Try two. Try three. Try four. Yes! No! For literally hours. Mack just fell and fell. Oh, yeah. And then he fell. We're going to be here until 
about four days from now. No matter how hard he tried, he just couldn't grab on to that
third ball. We've been going so long
that the sun is literally starting to come up. This is your legacy. You got it. Yes. Yes. It literally took him
three hours to get on that ball. Hold on! 
Don't drop that bar. I'm not dropping the bar. He did it. Press the button before you drop the bar. Let's go. Oh my gosh! Yeah! Well... You only have two more obstacle
courses to finally win one of these videos. It's not getting harder than that. You can't lie to a man
while you shake their hand. Exactly. Which we're doing. That totally was the hardest one. Just kidding. Mack is screwed. This next one is way harder. 
Right this way, Mack. - Watch out! Watch your step. 
- What? Where are we going? Yeah. Forward! - I can't see. 
- Take the blindfold off. Welcome to level five. What? What is this? What's.
What's going on? This level, you could probably tell 
we just built. You see? Balance has been a trouble for you
in past videos. You even declined the balance beam
earlier in this video. You weren't even able to get over one rolling log without falling
and six times in a row. So now you'll have to cross not one,
but three rolling logs and get all eight
bags of money to the other side. And if you fall once, just once,
you lose everything. And before you do this challenge,
I left out one final thing. You mind pulling this lever? What's going to happen when
I pull the lever? Just pull the lever. - There's no way.
- We're doing this challenge... - No! no, no, no!
- 200 feet up in the sky. Why? It was perfectly fine. Not the sky. The feeling of the ground just 
disappearing like that. I'm not gonna lie.
I'm kind of scared. This is wild. You will be not human
if you weren't scared of it. Oh my gosh. We’re so high up! You okay Mack? No. What's wrong? I feel like I'm about to
lose all this again, dude. I'm... Just don't fall. This exact thing. I couldn't even get across
on the Wipeout course. I fell off of it like five times. And now there's three of them,
and we're 200 feet in the sky. In case I do fall. Thank you for giving me a third
chance.  I don't know if I've ever actually said 
thank you for giving me a third chance. No, you just yelled at me a bunch. Yeah, I know. 
Well, you put me in the sky. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. This is very sweet,
but I have a feeling you're just stalling
because you're afraid. Yeah. Mack has lost $1.5 million. Let's see if it becomes 2.3 million. Whenever you're ready. There's only one thing I say 
in situations like this over and over again. Godspeed. When he walks, the entire platform shakes. There it is.
There it is. I'm going to go for it. 
Right there, watch out. Yes! And the final piece
of the challenge that I haven't told Mack
is as long as you've made it across. You're free to move
on to the final obstacle course with whatever
money you brought. Or if you're feeling risky,
you can come back for more. He didn't see that coming. This is a good bit. What do you think I should do? No, bro, you go for it. You just did this. You first tried both bags.
Are you kidding me? You're coming
back at 600 grand or not? In the wise words of Karl. But you're doing this on your own
accord. and if you fail, it's not... No, I'm doing it because Karl told me to. Karl Jacob's a celebrity. There he is. Oh, my God. Oh, perfect. He has now made one full trip. I'm going to either sleep
with a smile on my face tonight, or I won't sleep for three. Let's go. And while Mack is hundreds of feet
in the air risking 800 grand. I want to tell you about Cirkul. The best part about Cirkul 
is these flavor cartridges which you just screw one 
on the top like this, which allows you to make your water
tastes like whatever you want. You can also adjust the flavor
intensity just by turning this dial. So if you set it to three,
you'll get a little bit of flavor. But Karl set it to nine now. Jimmy, that's a lot of flavor. That's a ton of flavor, which
makes it easier to drink more water. I have an idea. 
Karl! Oh. That's it. I can't believe he's
actually them. - That's four.
- I can't believe that worked. Dude, I just wish
that there was new colored bottles. Cirkul actually has 
five new colored bottles available now. Okay. Welcome back. See you. 
If you want to give Cirkul a try, just go to your local Walmart
right now because I convinced Cirkul to give their biggest drop ever
for a limited time. All right, Karl, 
are you ready to send it again? Take your time. I can't believe he's throwing
these hundreds of feet in the air. Every one of these
throws is literally 100 grand. Good stuff, man. - Ready to finish it out?
- Let's do this. Do you want to just
stay over there and move on? Or do you want to come back here? This is where things get risky. You can go over there with Karl and move on competing 
for only 600 K Or once again, grab the last
$200,000 and risk it all. Dude, you got this. All right. That's the Mack I know. Okay. God dang it, dude. You made it across.
Why are you mad? Because I almost didn't
make it across. He's back. Bring on the money, baby. All right, let's bring it home. No hesitation. Godspeed. And he's off.
He's off. Take a second, bro.
You're good. This is a routine now. Yes. - You ready to do this?
- Oh, yeah. - Let's bring it home, huh?
- Yeah, dude. Think about your
legs. Don't fall. All right. Okay. I'm coming to you. 
All right? Okay. All the money's on the other side. Now he just has to cross
without falling. Three. Two. One. He did it. Oh my God! Oh my God. 
Oh my God. Come on. You thought I was done? We're not done yet, baby. Come on! Don't celebrate yet. The last challenge is
where you always lose. I'm not messing this up again. And now it's time
for the final challenge. Once again, Mack is blindfolded. But you can probably tell
by the noise. We are going back up. We are now at the top. A couple more steps.
A couple more steps. Take off your blindfold. Witness the final challenge. This is by far the most insane obstacle course
in this entire video. Oh, man. Dude, that is that is. That is crazy. I wouldn't blame you
if you're terrified at this course. And because you've been through a lot and not only this video,
but past videos including spiders, drowning, boulders, lasers,
and of course, cookies. I have one out for you. You look right here. You don't even know 
what I'm going to say yet. I know exactly
what you're going to say. I'm not doing that thing. In here is an umbrella cookie. So I'm going to give you a choice. You can attempt this umbrella cookie and if you complete it
with 800 grand. Or attempt this giant, monstrosity, physics defying obstacle course. And if you complete that, win 800 grand. This is a massive decision. - Here's the cookie. 
- I'm not accepting it. At least not yet. I've had actual, legitimate
nightmares about this cookie. Oh, What was that, like a wop-wop ah? Kind of, that's sad. But I guess, I mean, 
you did lose $1.5 million to it. And if you lose right now, $2.3 million and no other 
attempts in the future. He just threw it. Now that I know that. All right, we won't be needing
this bad boy. There is no turning back. Every single challenge
in every video. All boils down to this moment right now. Let's get it. To kick it off he has these 
two trapeze bars and then a yellow platform. This only ends by you finishing or you falling. This is gonna be crazy. All right, we're off. He did it! That's only going to get easier,
right? Yeah. Just don't look down. He looked down right when I said that. Here we go. That is insane. By the way, Mack, did I tell you
I brought your mom and dad out? They're down there
watching right now. - Go Mack.
- Come on Mack. Mack, you can do this. Oh my God. Oh, God. - Yes, yes.
- Mack! This next contraption
is what I call the Wall of Death. Creative name. Oh, boy. This one has a little bit
of strategy. He can go up and down, or he can
just come straight across right there. And in case you forgot,
put the camera down. We're still 200 feet in the air. Oh my God. This is insane. Don't take your hand off. That's freaking me out. Freaking you out? My hands are sweating
just watching. Oh, I feel sick. This makes me want to throw up. God, this handles are so small. Almost there. Yes! - Mom, are you okay? 
- Yes. My arms are so tired. Well, lucky for you, you still have, like, a quarter
of a football field left, and you're going to need your
strength for all of the remaining levels. This one is all about when you 
dismount the circle. Basically,
if you let go too early, you fall. Mack, you're shaking your arms out a lot. You better save your strength. You know how it works. The hardest is still yet to come. Yes! Yes! Now the giant swinging hammers. These things are massive. And I see you brought my friend
the balance beam back. If he gets hit, there's
no shot he's... - What are you doing?
- What does it look like I'm doing? Watch your head. Oh my God. That’s gotta be terrifying. Yeah, Mack. Yeah! You're now at the final part of level six. Now, listen, I know earlier
you chose not to attempt the cookie. However, considering the history
you have with these cookies, I just couldn't resist
bringing them back one last time. I thought you already brought them back. Why are you bringing it back twice? 
There's no need for that. I knew you were going to say no to that. Anyone with a brain says no to that. - How do I get to that? 
- You just jump, How else did you get there? And with every jump They get further and further apart. And if that wasn't hard enough,
I made sure that each cookie gets exponentially smaller
by the jump. And the only thing between
each of them is a trapeze bar. and 200 feet of untethered free fall. - You got this Mack. 
- You got it. Four jumps. Let's see if Mack gets rich. Three. Two. One. Oh God. It was almost over right there. That was terrifying. One down, three more to go. And Mack
almost lost on the biggest cookie. Remember, the cookies get smaller
with every jump. Don't let this be the moment
where you repeat history. Because it's
going to be your final fall. As you can see, this bar is outside
of Mack's reach, so he has to jump. And if he misses it midair, it's
over and you go home with nothing... One. ...but shame Okay. He's swinging a lot. Don't swing for too long, Mack. You're gonna need to save
your strength for the umbrella. - Yes.
- Mack! Yes! There's some more. Does the crack of the star
remind you of anything? You're in the endgame now, Mack. These two cookies have broken you just as much as you have
broken them. Fail here and the chance to be lifted 
from the darkness, will be gone forever. Godspeed. He's off. - Yeah!
- Yes! - Go Mack.
- Go Mack. All right, we're on the final jump. Twice as far as the previous jump. Arguably the biggest hurdle
in Mack's entire life. The umbrella. It's do or die. 
He's either going to win 800 grand Or the saga ends
 and this all was for nothing. Your family's rooting for you. Everyone at home is rooting for you Three. I can't breathe. Two. One. I think... Oh, he's about to jump.
He jumped Oh my gosh. He's so far away from that cookie. - I can't watch this.
- I can't breathe. Just so you know,
there's 60s left, man. Wait.
What just happened? Oh, no. I actually don't know what to say. I'm such an idiot, dude. Oh my God. I did that twice? - Yes!
- Yeah! Yeah! - You did it. 
- Yeah. After three tries.
You finally did it. For the first time he is holding 
the money that he has won. - Yes! 
- Yeah. What are you gonna spend
the $800,000 on? I've got three friends of mine, 
childhood friends of mine. They don't have a lot of money. I'm gonna make sure they don't worry
about money anymore. I mean, my life's changed now. Congrats man. 
You deserve it. It's changed forever, bro. You deserve it. Dude, thank you. 
Thank you so much. Yes! Dude! Dude! Yes! Yes! Look at how happy they are. Oh, I love you guys. Mack, Mack. 
Oh my God! I did it mom. 
Thank you! Good job, man. I've never been so happy to lose $800,000. Congrats man."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LlX4t0A9I,"$10,000 Every Day You Survive In The Wilderness",1570,20240601,en,"I just drop this two strangers
off in the middle of the wilderness. These two guys have
never met each other in their life. Nice to meet you, man. Every day that the two of you
survive in the wilderness, I'll give you $10,000. I hope you brought enough money,
man. We're here for the long run. Hey, put that camera down. Let's head out. Take care boys.
This video can make you guys millionaires. He's going to be poor
by the time we're out of here! - I'm Hase.
- Hase, I'm Grizz. - Nice to meet you, man.
- Grizz? All right. You're gonna be my best
friend for the next, however long. Starting now. These guys receive $10,000 everyday with the only limit
being how long they can survive. Which theoretically means
they could win unlimited money. Dude, if we stay here,
we’re both multimillionaires. We are trying to find a camping spot,
build a fire, survive at night. I guess we should just set up camp here. For the rest of the night, they gathered wood
and went through their supplies, We've got approximately five days
worth of food, Two things of water. Looks like a change of clothes. some warm jackets and boom, a fire starter. Let’s see if we can get a fire going. - Oh, yeah!
- We are good. Let’s make beds out of pine needles. It won’t be comfortable, but at least
we won’t freeze to death tonight. We're alive. Day two. In the morning, I showed up
to give them their first $10,000. Boys, how was the first night? It was cold. It’s been 24 hours and I didn't walk over with ten grand. You're not gonna ask? - Yeah, I guess we should, right?
- Yeah. Okay. Just look up. Oh my... Here we go! Every 24 hours, we're to drop
$10,000 out of a plane for you guys. - There's $10,000!
- In a parachuted briefcase. Catch it! Go catch it! Go- watch out! - Bro, this is crazy.
- Okay.  Bro, we’re going to be so rich
by the end of this video. And on top of that money, This is your flare gun. Very careful. Shoot it up in the air. The challenge ends for both of you and you walk away
with the money you've won. So, how long should we stay out here? 3.6 million for the year is crazy. Alright, the plan's officially a year. We're going to split this in two.
You get this. - Yes.
- I get this. Now, we can't screw each other over. But later in this video, that plan doesn't exactly work. Alright, I feel bad, but I
need to steal that flare gun. I just got to shoot this thing,
and I get to be a dad again. If you fire that flare, I literally
think I'm going to kill you. Well buddy, you ready to get rich? Absolutely. By day three you could say the boys were
pretty tired of sleeping on the ground. So after another 10 grand, they started
work on building their shelter. Going to use my jacket
to gather pine needles and layer them on the shelter. Alright, I found this metal piece
from a kid's swing set, and I think it's going to work great
for the roof for our shelter. Layer one on. Here's
a section that we're working on. You see, it's
got some structural poles. We get to use the parachutes
and the cord. So we're going to make a rain cover
on our shelter. Everyone thinks probably,  that I'll be the reason we
leave and fail this challenge, but this money would
mean college for the kids. And then on day four they started looking
for a water source. Oh, there's a swamp. I would feel safe boiling that. Yeah, we gotta be
careful because that stuff is full of bacteria
and parasites. Just a touch of the swamp. Alright, We’re going to bed. Hopefully Grizz snuggles up
because it's cold and he's big and warm. This is like the third day in a row
that we've gotten two hours of sleep. It's been so cold. If it rained right now,
we'd probably have to go to the hospital. But I do it for $10,000. And it wasn't just the freezing
temperatures that we're getting to them. We're at the end of our supplies. Grizz likes to call it a fast, which sounds so much nicer
than starving. And for the next few days,
the hunger problem didn't get any easier. We had a little square of
beef jerky this morning and that's it. Jimmy gave us five days worth
of food and it's day nine right now. These are Greenbrier leaves. Grizz says they're edible, I guess. Yeah. It was clear by this point That the boys
were extremely hungry. But lucky for them, I had a surprise
waiting for them on day 10. They've officially survived
ten days. - Yeah, brother! Bring in the helicopter. Oh, man. I'm nervous dude. Oh my gosh. To celebrate Day 10, brought you guys an additional
ten days worth of food, spices, two tarps and everything
you would need to fish. All of this for $50,000
of your prize money. -You want some beef jerky?
- Yes. Don't eat it yet. These beans look good? - Absolutely. He's not kidding. This is literally all the
things we would need to fish. - 50 grand.
- 50 grand. - Should we talk to them now?
- Yeah. - All right.
- All right. All right, Jimmy. I'll throw in two Feastable bars. Yes. Let's do it. - Thank you.
- Thanks, Jimmy! Thanks, Jimmy. It's definitely a deal
we had to say yes to. That week of food literally cost
as much as my kid's college tuition. - Hello!
- Hey! Bro, I still can't believe it every time
this money falls out of the sky. The food from the crate
will keep them fed for ten days.  But if they want to make it a year… Alright, the plan is officially a year. They’ll still need to find
more food in the wilderness. So some of you might be wondering, Why have they not caught fish?  Well, the swamp nearby has no fish in it.  What we really need is
moving water that we can fish in. And while Hase was
grumbling on about his kids… And my two-year-old
doesn't sleep very well either, so... This happened. I think being a dad- What is this? This is a creek.
This is not a swamp. This is actually moving water. There's fish in here.
Dude, look at this. It's like a dock. This is the perfect place
for food and shelter. And after another few days full
of a surprise freezing rainstorm... Rain. At least now we have
a hundred thousand dollars. They decided to move and upgrade their shelter
near their new found water source. Good morning, Grizz. How are you always up earlier than me? We're
gathering up a bunch of dead trees that we can do for our structure. And then we balanced them together
into an A-frame shape and cut the trees to the right length. I'm sorry. No, it's all right.
I'm glad I broke your fall. Sorry. All right,
so maybe they had a bit of a false start, but once they got the structure back up,
they spent the entire next day putting their finishing
touches on their shelter. They even built a fishing dock
to help them catch more food. - Docks done.
- Pleasantly surprised. And now all we got to do
is catch a fish. - Come on. Right?
- Yeah. And as good as was this may be without sleeping bags, the winter
night was still unforgiving. Another  really cold night. Cold toes, cold feet. No sleeping bag. So I think I knew what my next offer was. It's Day 20 and they moved
super deep in the woods so now we have to get there by boat. - You hear that sound in the distance?
- What'd you say? Is that a boat? Any minute now, when we find them, I've got a fun offer for them. How's it going, boys? - Hey, Jimmy!
- Hey, guys. What's going on? Two things. First,
the plane needed maintenance, so I'm delivering this by hand. - Hey, all right.
- Here's your $10,000, which puts you guys at $140,000. And second, we have an offer for you. Reveal your offer. Just go ahead.
Take it off. Here it is. Ooh. You can either give me $10,000
for that red sleeping bag or give me $50,000
and you get both sleeping bags. - What?
- Five times the amount for both. Oh, man. - Can I take it out?
- Yeah. Look at it. Yeah. Check them out. Hang on. I just got to do this. These are the same sleeping
bag we used in Antarctica. They work very well.
Here's the weather forecast. It's going to get pretty cold
next week, so I highly recommend
you at least buy one. When we started this thing out,
we were in the twenties without anything. We've adapted to it. We have bedding, we have pine straw. We're doing pretty well
in these low temperatures. I would love to have a sleeping bag. But $50,000 is... I sleep closer to Grizz
than I do my wife, so... I'm not even kidding. You're actually going to say no
to both? A really cold night. No sleeping bag. Yeah, so I think- I think it's final. We don't want it. - Yeah. Agreed.
- Not even a single sleeping bag. All right, boys, close it up. Sure the boys could survive
without sleeping bags,  but that didn’t solve their food problem. In between sitting out rainy days,
the boys go into a bit of a routine where they would boil water,
work on their shelter, and try to catch fish,
which wasn't really working out for them. We've got some guts for bait and we're going to cast them out,
and hopefully the fish come off the bottom of the creek. Day after day of failing
to catch any fish... Let's go check the lines.
See if any catfish are on. They finally caught a wind
in their sails. Grizz! Or whatever that
abomination of Mother Nature was. What is that? Can I eat it? First fish. It's an eel and I think I'm gonna
charcoal grill it. We're going to have ourselves
some American style unagi. This is the first thing that
we've caught out here in 27 days, which is insane. We're happy to have it, and
we're going to make it delicious. I don't know
if this is what I call delicious, but the fact that they haven't
had a fresh meal in almost 30 days means even a rock would
taste good to them at this point. It's excellent. It's so good. It's really.
It's just, like, amazingly good. If we keep catching fish like this
we can easily stay for a year, bro. Dude, yeah. 3.6 million dollars. Good night. And on Day 28, they started constructing the raised
bed system in their new shelter. So it's going to be two tripods. One, two. Side rails going down. Slats across, and then a nice pine needle
mattress made out of parachutes. And after seeing their new shelter
become more and more comfortable, I was starting to get worry
that I was going to pay these guys millions of dollars. The only regret that I have,
they're not bunk beds. that's honestly an L. They were betting everything on their new shelter
being right next to this creek. But that may have been
a huge mistake because they couldn't catch another
eel to save their lives. Snapped it. At this point I've spent more time
in the wilderness than I have with my newborn son. I also have a two year old
with my wife alone. How do you explain to a two year old that daddy's going to be gone
and he won't talk to you, he won't call you
and he won't see you. Say they were making us an offer, What would be something
that you would actually buy? We spend a lot of time out here
trying to get firewood. You know, having firewood
dropped off would be really nice. I'd probably pay $10,000 for that. We are literally
in the middle of the forest. I couldn't tell you where we are
anymore. Oh, right. How's it going, boys? - Doing great, man. How are you?
- Yeah. As a reward for surviving an
entire month, I brought you a store. Oh, okay. We combed through
all your vlog footage, and we wrote down everything you've
asked for it, such as firewood, a shovel, cooking supplies, bedding,
and even books and board games. It's like a dollar store,
but everything costs $10,000. Oh, man. This is your store. Feel free to shop. We’ve won 240 grand.
Might as well check it out. - What are these? Those are mosquito nets. We'll use parachutes. We don't need those. All right, what about the hammocks? I like the hammocks, but, you know, we haven't tried
making them out of parachutes yet. All right, Grizz, answer this. What do you can you not make out
of parachutes? A lot. Okay, well,
do you guys want the firewood? - How much wood?
- That's the wood you get. If it came with unlimited wood,
I would buy it. I offer them literally everything
they could possibly need here, and they still weren't interested. I was beginning to think these two were secretly
Navy Seals or something. Are you guys going to buy
literally anything? You make ten grand a day. What's another ten grand? - I got to say no.
- All right. In a million years, would not have thought
they would say no to everything. Next time I'm
going to convince you to spend money. - We're looking forward to.
- Yeah, man. See you, Jimmy! - There he goes.
- In his tank. Stop right here.
I have a special surprise for all of you. Nolan, what does this look like? A lot of phones. A thousand phones to be exact. Because over the next seven days,
I'm going to be giving a thousand random people
that subscribe a free Samsung Galaxy S24. I literally spent over
$1 million on these phones, and I'm giving them away to you. All you have to do to enter to win
one of these phones is subscribe. It's literally free. I just want you to know
I appreciate everything you guys have been doing
for the channel. It means the world to me. Subscribe. Win one of these phones. Let's go. And so they continued without
any of the tools from my offer. But go figure,
for the next few days, they weren't able to catch any fish. And even though
the money kept coming, they were running out of food
and time to catch it quickly. I am on the last belt loop. I think that we have maybe two days
or something worth of food left. That's not good. Without a boat, this creek is not productive. We got to go to that river. If I can get to that river
and the fishing is good, that'll turn all this around. With their rations
running dangerously low, their only hope of
getting food was to travel through the swamp
to the river on the other side in hopes
of catching some fish. It's risky wasting all these
calories, but I have to do it. If we're going to make it any further. But after a grueling hike, Hase finally found what he was
looking for. Oh my gosh. Oh, look at that. It's the river. Is that not the most gorgeous thing
you've ever seen? Finding this river is probably
the difference between us making our goal
and us tapping out early. Fortunately, he had a secret weapon. Grizz
and I made our own fishing pole. This thing is going
to make catching fish easy. With Hase's makeshift fishing
pole immediately breaking, he was going to have to use
his hands and he spent hours trying, and failing. Oh, no. And If he couldn't catch any fish
without immediately dropping them, the calories burned coming here
would be for nothing. But just when he was ready to give up... This is going to be it. Yeah. Holy moly. Yes, I told you it was that one! And the luck didn't stop there. I cannot wait to bring this back
to Grizz. He's going to be so stoked. We're eating tonight! Hey! All right, that's awesome. Feels like
this is our first real food in ages. But in the meantime,
I was preparing an offer that I know they couldn't refuse. It's day 40. They've made over a third of $1
million. And I have an incredibly special for them. For $10,000, and I think that you're really going
to like this. You both can see your wives. In fact, they're watching right now. - Do it! Do it!
- Oh my God, guys. Are you serious? Oh, man. - I can't let down my kid.
- I know. I can't let down my wife. Okay, Jimmy. Yes! Yeah! Oh, yeah. - Yes!
- Oh my God. It's me, it's daddy. - Oh, my God.
- I smell so bad. Hi, Talia. As nice as it was to see
their families, the visit was also bittersweet because there's one big question
on everyone's mind. How long do you want us to stay? I want you home now. Like, I do. I know you want me home. But do you need me home? Yes, she needs you. Yes. You need to bond with your son. I don't care what the other guy
says. You've made enough money. I need you home. That conversation was so difficult
for me. Even so,
yesterday was a really good day. It had all of the things
that I love. It had my family, my wife,
my kids, my buddy Grizz. That was like a really huge gift. But they're gone now. To hold her and know that she was safe. It really has changed the way that
I'm viewing this entire challenge. Knowing I have my wife's support. I want to stay
until I have $1 million. And after some much needed family time, Hase and Grizz were much
happier than I'd ever seen. Hase and Grizz, Grizz, Grizz. - Hase and Grizz, Grizz, Grizz. Ambush! Let's smoke some fish. Look at that. This is perfect. Even when something happened that would've totally drained
them before... $400,000. By now, they didn't even seem to mind. It looks like someone had a gender
reveal. And the gender was just money. Even though their spirits were high,
there was still a problem they needed to solve. In order to get to the river to fish, they would first need to trudge
through this giant swamp. But if they had a boat, they'd easily be able to float down
the creek to the river. I'm building a boat. The idea is to create a frame
with sticks and then attach our tarp
so the whole thing can float. I'm not feeling super confident
in the boat build. If we can get down to fish without having to tromp
through a whole swamp, it's worth the risk. Time for the first sea
trial of my beautiful ship. - Here he goes.
- Grizz! And this was pretty ironic considering the offer
I was about to bring them. It's day 50. Let's see how they're doing. - Hey.
- What's up? Oh, you guys have a village now. Wait, are you serious? You built a boat? Yeah, man. You're telling me this
thing can actually float? - You want to try it?
- Yeah, I don't... I... Oh, my gosh, it actually works. He built a freaking boat
in the woods. All right,
now that I'm aware of that, this changes a lot of things.
It's actually insane that you two built a boat yesterday because I brought the two of you
a boat with a Zaxby's restaurant. Oh my gosh. That is so cool, Jimmy. Before I present the offer,
I want to make sure you're in a really good state of mind. This is our brand new MrBeast box which are now live at
every single Zaxby's across America. Oh, my God,
that is so good. The MrBeast box comes with the
best tasting chicken known to man. And the cool part is, every single
meal comes with the Feastables bar. Our goal with this collab
was to take the world's best chicken and pair it
with the world's best chocolate. Indeed! Zaxby's also has 12 sauces. There's like so many flavors
happening in my mouth. What is that? - That's really good.
- It's the Zax sauce. Look how happy they are. If you want to be happy like them, just go to Zaxby's
and get the MrBeast box right now. Now that you guys have gotten your meals, your day 50 offer is for 50 grand you can have this boat. We don't have a motor. We don't have
any way to get this thing around. So you just use sticks. Oh, Lord, I don't know. Since you weirdly built the boat
the day before, I'll give you a discount.
We'll make it $40,000. My answer is I love the ship I made. I trust it with my life. So I'm going to leave it up to Grizz. For $40,000, - I'm going to pass on the boat.
- Yes! I'll get in Hase's death
trap instead. If that sinks
and you have to quit, I tried. We appreciate the food. That was lovely. - Bye, Jimmy.
- I'll see you next time. So this ship saved us $40,000. - It's still a death trap.
- Hey hey, hey. Man, when we first started this
thing, it was in the dead of winter. - You remember how cold it was?
- Yeah. Now everything is so nice and warm. And spring was now in full bloom. And they were looking
pretty comfortable. There's a lot of flowers here. - I can't say that I mind it.
- What is today? 51? I don't know. I lost track. - I hear an airplane coming in.
- Where? Oh, he's coming straight at us. This briefcase puts us at $440,000. Time to build the Hase and Grizz loveseat. 80% of what we're sitting on here
is going straight to my business. This case? I don't want Katie
to work 24-hour shifts anymore. This money is going to do
so much for her and our family. But while the warmer weather was nice, it presented new problems like snakes.... Don't want to get bit by that. And rats. - Get out of here!
- Every night. Oh my God. And It wasn't long until the lack
of sleep started to make them irritable. Looks like Hase
is struggling to get over here. Hase, do you need my help? What does it look like? You want to paddle up-river into the wind? Hase, why don't you get over there
and get those fishing lines fixed? You know what? You shut your mouth
when you're talking to me. He's angry. Can you check those lines
while you're over there? - What do you think I'm doing?
- I don't know, I was just asking. Thank you for telling me what to do what I'm already doing once again. Very angry. Keep in mind, at this point, Hase and Grizz
 were very close friends, but Hase had reached
the end of his rope and the jokes just weren't
hitting the same anymore. Grizz's idea about how this
would unwind is not working. Obviously,
because it's a stupid idea. Hey. I'm sorry, buddy,
I did not know I was actually pissing you off. I thought- I did not know
that you were actually upset. It's all right. Okay. And so, feeling frustrated, Hase, having turned off his camera,
paddle down river where he set up his camp
until the next day. Hase has set sail, and I think he may have run away. I certainly be thinking about him. I know it's supposed to be cold
at night. If he's not back in a couple days,
I'm going to have to go looking for him. Let's do something to cheer him up. So we got a huge board
over here that was left by Jimmy at the last Beast Drop And I'm going to repurpose it
into a table with some of our cases. This is actually pretty sturdy. And when Hase returned home,
he was not empty handed. Sounds like Hase has returned
from his great adventure. Nice. Oh, there's a sea trout. I'm pretty wiped out. - Mind if I take a minute.
- No, man. Do your thing. Grizz! - Yeah, buddy?
- What's this? It's our table. - We have a table.
- Yeah. Oh, man! Yeah, I figured
that would perk him up a little bit. This is $100,000 table, Grizz. - Welcome back, buddy.
- Feels good to be home. Come on. With their survival needs met
and their friendship restored, one question still remained. How long will they stay? We gotta have a serious
conversation. - Yeah.
- The end. Honestly, I'd have been done
five days ago. Maybe push, like, an extra week. I mean, hell, that's a $35,000 each. If I pulled that flare on day 70, how would you feel? I would feel... really let down and lied to. I propose at day 70 we have a conversation decide
if we're going to push further. That's fair. I promised Grizz
that I would stay longer for him, but I'm not happy about it. Morning, guys. So Hase has been a little upset. I'm seeing it. He's keeping to himself, you know?
So I'm a little worried about him. Spoken to Grizz about it.
He wants me to stay longer. He's kind of pushing me to stay longer
and stay longer. At some point I got to stop being
wilderness guy and go be dad. Another day. Yeah. Oh, no. No, no. I knew that was going to happen.
I saw it. Oh no. Oh, no. Hase going to check out to the case
that has dropped from the sky. Day 70. I'm going to see
if Grizz is good being done today. See what he says. What are we going to do
with all this money? I kind of want to talk to you
about that. I´m kind of ready to hit the flare. What do you think about that? I want to stay longer. I know that that you've got to pull... away from this thing with family. I know, I know, I know, I know, we've talked about it a thousand times. I just want to know
how you feel about it today. Yes or no? Can you go one more day? Give yourself 24 hours
just to kind of feel it out. I thought a lot about it, but if you want to go another day,
let's go another day. How's it going, boys? - How are you, buddy?
- Good. Let's go on a little walkie-walk. We can go over here. Let's say Hase isn't
a part of the equation. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. How many more days do you think
you could survive out here? Let's call it 45 days would probably be as far as I'd go. How many do you think
he has left in the tank? He talks about it every day. How often do you think about
shooting the flare? Every day. What stops you? At this stage, Grizz. You know?
He wants to make a million dollars and it's hard to say no to that. I have an obligation
to him, too. But it's starting to go towards
family. - Yeah.
- Yeah. When you do shoot that flare,
that's going to be crazy. Oh, I can't wait. Sleep okay last night? I don't want to disappoint Grizz but... I'm... I think I'm done. Thought it would be cool
to come back here to our first camp, where I was shoulder to shoulder
with Grizz every single night. And after that it was like:
""All right, dude, we're brothers now."" I expected to walk away
with a lot of money. I didn't expect to walk away
with, like, a friend for life and... that's so meaningful to me. I kind of got to think about what's right for me and my family. It's... Hase got so desperate
that he literally went into Grizzlies bag
and stole the flare gun, even though it was his idea
to separate it into two parts. At this point, all I have to do is shoot this thing. And I get to be a dad again.
You know? I know this thing is
is very challenging. What we're doing out
here is not easy. I really, truly do
believe that you're doing - what's right for your family.
- I disagree. You're providing for them in a way
that's gonna change their life. Now it's gone the other way. Now it's... I think I need... I need to be there. I think that you've been really upset and you've been missing
your family really bad. I feel like... - I think the money doesn't matter.
- You spiraled through this thing. The money doesn't...
The money doesn't matter to me anymore. And really, the only thing that's
keeping me here is you. And I'm sick of it. Yeah, my family needs me, too, you know? You're very good at,
you know, manipulating me. I don’t know. It was clear that in this moment Grizz
was going to have to make a decision. Convince Hase
to continue surviving in these woods
for more and more money, or be there for his friend
when he needed him the most. I can't imagine... having gone through this experience
with anyone else. I mean, I really do, like, I genuinely
think of you like a brother, you know? I'm sorry that I've just pushed you
on and on and on. - I just don't want to let you down.
- You're not letting me down. - Yeah, I am.
- Brothers don't let each other down. That's the way it is. Everything. Everything's got to come to an end
sometime. Let me see that flare. I owe you this. And to be honest with you, I'm sorry that it's taken so long. I think it's time for us
to do this thing, buddy. - I love you, buddy.
- I love you too, man. You smell bad. I think that they shot the flare.
No, you take that one. Let's go check in on them. - We're rich!
- We're rich! - Boys. Oh my God.
- Hey, Jimmy. When we dropped them off this is what they looked like, and here's them 74 days later. Crazy. Yes, they look crazy. You haven't left these woods
in 74 days. - Dude, I'm so ready.
- One final surprise. Oh my God! Oh my gosh! Hi, Talia, baby! I love you! After 74 days, they won $670,000. In case you forgot, we're giving away

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6PqxbvOCUI,"Protect The Yacht, Keep It!",907,20240511,en,"This is officially your yacht. Congrats, man. The only catch is I'm going to do
everything in my power to destroy it. And it's up to you to protect it
from attacks like 100 cannonballs, massive explosives,
and so much more. You got to be kidding me. And you have exactly 24 hours from
now to build your defenses for the yacht. Time has started. Good luck. All right, dude. Let's see if this yacht sinks. Sean, using my credit card, immediately
bought a bunch of supplies and began building his defense
against phase one, 100 cannon shots. Run me through your plan. My plan is to build a giant wall angled
to hopefully block the cannon fire. And after working
all throughout the night, into the next morning
and all the way through a complete 24 hours,
Sean was going to have to call it. Because the time is up. Let's go shoot some cannons. Will his defense protect his new yacht from a hundred cannonballs or will we start this video over
with a new contestant? Phase one of four has begun. - I'm nervous.
- All right, Sean. We're about to fire the cannons
at your new yacht. - Terrifying.
- Aim the cannon. Fire. That's just going right through. Dude, it is ripping through
those storage containers. The cannons were melting
through his defense like butter. I'm toast, man. I feel like I lost a little piece
of my soul. And probably a piece of your yacht. The cannons were already
damaging Sean's yacht, and we're just getting started. These cannons are tearing me up.
She's a goner. I guarantee
it just went straight through. We kept firing cannon after cannon
ripping through Sean's defense. These cannons were way more hardcore
than I thought they were. After a torturous three hours. Oh, go, go, go. Let's go see this thing. Somehow. God, I hope my yacht isn't shredded. Sean's yacht actually survived. You have a tiny hole
and it hit a rail. Dude. Bro, a cannonball hit right here. But that was only the least
of the damage. No. The bathroom in Sean's yacht
was completely destroyed. Look at that mirror right there. Three cannonballs hit your yacht
and you nearly survived phase one. I'll take it. Three out of a hundred.
It's pretty good. No, I need you to take
phase two more seriously. Ok. And if you don't think I'm
being serious, I'll just show you. Bring out the bomb. In 24 hours. Those 15 sea bombs
will explode around your yacht. Oh, no. And by the way, we tested
these things before the video. They are extremely powerful. 15 big booms
in a circle around this thing. How am I going to protect this? I'm gonna go hit the hay in a yacht
surrounded by bombs. Come back
fresh in a couple of hours. Sean got up the next morning
and immediately got to work, but because of the severe thunderstorm,
he couldn't use his crane. This is brutal. We're doing everything today
by hand. How are you going to pad up the yacht? Mattresses. That's right. Sean's big plan is mattresses and his workers bought
every mattress in town. All of those mattresses. We'll start
ferrying them back and forth. There we go. All the way around, every inch. I can't even tell this is a yacht anymore. It just looks like
a bunch of mattresses. In 2 hours, we blew up the mines
and he hasn't really done as much as I thought. These are heavy. You know how much easier
this would be with the crane? You know how much easier this
would be if it wasn't in water? Yes. Clock's ticking. This is not looking good. I don't think his yacht's going to survive. Three, two, one. Time's up. That's all I'm going to get. So he has some mattresses and water
jugs. Karl, can you cover his ears? This might be the most hideous thing
I've ever seen. What I'm getting from you is you
don't think this is going to work? - Yeah.
- Yeah? Yeah. Let's see if the yacht sinks. Any last words? Can I have the hat? I will give you
my hat if your yacht survives. All right. Three, two, one. Blow it up. No! Oh my gosh. - There's no way that didn't do damage.
- It is over. - Come on.
- Let's go check it out. My yacht. It looks good. She's still standing. You did it. It just burned the mattresses.
That's right. I'm not sure what to say. Somehow,
these mattresses were actually a very effective defense
against the mines. In front of us is phase three. This attack
consist of three different levels. We're going to be launching
a million fireworks straight at your yacht, followed by a barrage
of flaming arrows, a level higher and finally catapults launching
flaming death balls from the sky. And by now, Sean's build strategies
were getting pretty efficient. He gave his crew orders. Yeah, let's go
ahead and get those containers moved into
place for phase three. Then got some much needed rest
while they worked. Now it's on to trebuchets, fireworks
and flaming arrows. What is your plan? My plan is to basically get more
shipping containers and build a giant wall. And I'm basically
just hoping that that wall will be tall enough to block the fireworks
and the flaming catapult debris from hitting the yacht. That's so sketch
this whole thing is so sketch. Today is my day. I'm feeling it. I'm hard... - Hard confidence now.
- Okay. Compared to phase two. This is insane. - You really stepped it up.
- Yeah, man. You went from a pathetic build that
led multiple cannonballs through to this, which I actually
think might work. He is currently taking lake water,
flushing it through sprinklers to wet his mattresses. All right, We're about to go
inspect his defenses. Is now a bad time to tell you guys,
I'm afraid of heights? This is a 40 foot tall, solid wall. When we fling the catapults, they're going to fly over
the shipping containers where I'm at and hopefully hit his yacht. Right? No, you're going to miss. Hey, Chandler envision you're catapult
with giant flaming balls. I got you. Ready? Aim,  Fire. That's the one. Dead hit. Your boat's going down. Not going to happen. All right,
So why are you so confident? You have 30 seconds where you can be
building and you're doing nothing. We're ready. It's covered up.
I built the wall. Everything's wet back there. Do we even need to wait 20 seconds? No, let it rip. Let's do it. Time's up. Phase three is upon us. Catapults, flaming arrows
and a million fireworks. Let's see if this yacht lights on fire. Ready the fireworks. Any last words? Good luck. Fire the fireworks. Oh, my God. That doesn't look real, bro. That is wild. Oh my gosh. How is this… How is this doing that? While these pretty fireworks are going off, I'm going to tell you about
Bloons Tower Defense 6. Bloons Tower Defense is a game I've actually been playing
since I was a teenager. - Oh my god!
- They're so many. No joke. I used to literally play this
in English class when I was 15. Dude, I see smoke on his yacht. And they're back with their sixth
installment of the game. Bloons Tower Defense 6. Oh, my God. How is this doing that? And if you've never played
Bloons Tower Defense, basically you defend yourself
against the balloons  by placing monkey towers
and heroes on the map. - I want to celebrate something right now.
- Oh my goodness, bro. It's hitting his yacht. Oh, yeah.
It is hitting the top of his yacht. That firework just hit his yacht. Blow up the arrows. Now, it's time for
a thousand flaming arrows. Oh my God. The arrows are going
right over his wall. - Wow.
- Yeah! I wouldn't cheer yet. Ready to catapults. Ready? And because of the sponsor, the next
thing we're flinging are balloons... ...on fire. Here we go. Basically, flaming bowling balls. Fire in the hole. There goes. That's going straight for his yacht. They hit the shipping container
right by his yacht. Let's go, baby. If you buy anything in-game, use MrBeast in the supporter creator code,
if you want to support me and help me do more videos
like this. Make sure you download
Bloons Tower Defense 6. And if you download it right now,
you can get a MrBeast pack for free. Oh my God! Dude, his boat is exposed. Sean, I'm feeling worried for you
right now, bro. I'm still feeling good.
I think I'm good. This is a heavy balloon. Dude, this looks nothing like a balloon. You just don't look good enough balloons. The defenses are falling Let it rip. And if just one of these catapult shots
lands on Sean's yacht, This whole video might be over. That was a little closer
than I thought it was going to be. Fire the final catapult. Oh, that's a direct hit. Water. The only thing burned today is me, boys. All right. You know what? Sean, you might be laughing now, but you are not ready for this
final phase. In 24 hours from now,
we will be attacking your yacht with a barrage of machine guns. Any questions about phase four? In addition to every single phase
so far in this video combined the fireworks, the catapults,
the arrows, the 100 cannons. You have 100 more cannonballs? And rather than a bunch of bombs, this giant monstrosity,
borderline nuclear missile, questionably even illegal,
island flattening sea mine. All of that on top of machine
guns? Yeah. Today is phase
four of the challenge. The general plan is to just put a ton of stuff between my yacht
and the up and coming attacks. We're going to use
the remaining crates to try to block any cracks
the bullets might get through. That container is just perfectly placed
for this outside purge. Use as much dirt as we can
to create an impact barrier right in front of the wall where
the cannons are going to shoot. And since the giant bomb
can be sent from behind, I'm just going to do what I can with the time remaining and close
the back with water filled barrels. This challenge is tough. I mean, I'm away from home. I'm missing the family and the water element makes everything
so difficult because you can't just walk out to the boat
and put stuff on it. It's made it so difficult. That bomb has me nervous. He has multiple layers of metal shields
for the machine guns, a mound of sand and a bunch
of other stuff to stop the cannons. He still has the tall wall
for the projectiles and the soaked mattresses. Five, four, three, two, one. Everybody stop. Time is up. I think this is all
been a bad dream. No, this is real life. Even though it's my job
to destroy your yacht, I genuinely hope you win this thing. Ever since I was a little kid,
I always wanted a boat like this. I just got to get through this
final phase and we're home free. If you think about it, 100 hours ago,
there was just a boat. And now there's all of this. I don't know how you did it. You nervous? No, no. That makes literally no sense at all. This final phase
may just be your worst nightmare. Ready your weapons. On top of all these machine guns,
we have 100 cannons, a giant mine, the equivalent of all
15 from earlier. All of the fireworks, arrows and
catapults all together in one final phase Fire. They're in the boat.
I just saw one. Bro they're actually aiming
through the cracks. And if things couldn't
get more chaotic, one of the shooters accidently shot the fireworks in
and caused this to happen. Well, it looks like you made
the full package. What is going on? I'm going to be honest
with you, Sean. I don't think your yacht's
going to make it. But I think it's time for the next stage. Prepare the cannons. Let's
see if you've learned your lesson from the last time we fired these cannons. Fire. I saw one hit. It's actually scaring me now. Although one of the cannonballs
hit his yacht, the crate and mound of dirt were
able to stop the rest of the impact. And his defense against my flaming
catapults were so effective, he even caught a burning death ball. I caught it. Wait, did that land
in the shipping container? At the rate we're going,
this is going to take all night. I think we just send everything
all at once. I want you to launch cannons,
fireworks, arrows, catapults,
everything at the same time. Three, two, one. Fire everything. Look at how much smoke is out there. It's like World War III. How much more is this gonna take, Jimmy? Dude, this is killing me. You can't even see anything.
There's so much smoke. While we're watching Sean's yacht perish, we're going to enjoy some chocolate. Fire the cannons. Sean, so far, we've launched almost
every attack we have on your yacht. But like every YouTube video
I've ever done, we're saving the best for last. Or, in your case,
the worst for last. We took the 14
sea bombs from earlier in this video, combined them into one mega sea bomb. And it is currently on an RC boat
heading directly to blow up your yacht. This explosion
is going to be massive. All right. There she goes. There she goes. - That was crazy.
- Dude! - Let's go see if it's there.
- Let's go check it out. Let's go see my yacht. Look at everything
his yacht endured. I'm done a lot of weird things. I never experienced
something like this before. You didn't say
it had to be pretty. And after all of that,
your yacht is still floating, but it does look like some stray bullets
and cannonballs made it through. So, boys, bring it up. Here's $50,000. - Yeah.
- So you could actually repair this yacht. Yes. Before we end the video, they're going to
want to know... what is the name of your
brand new yacht? Its name is... Oh, and if you're wondering. Yes, we did ensure the lake
was completely cleaned up after this video. For the love of God,
subscribe so we can pass T-Series."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pv0iVoSZzN8,In 10 Minutes This Room Will Explode!,600,20240427,en,"I just started this ten minute timer and
when it hit zero that room all the way over there,
full of money will explode. And the only man that can stop it
is this man in this straight jacket. This video is completely real time. You'll notice it's exactly 10 minutes long. There are no cuts.
You see everything. And if Darcy does not escape
his jacket and get through all five floors of
this tower and press that button before the timer hits
zero, his money explodes. All right, he's coming down. Okay,
this is our first ever real-time shoot. - I got to go quick.
- Get in here, let's go. Go, go. 
Hey, hurry, unhatch this. Wait, how did he get out of that jacket 
so fast? It doesn't matter. This next
floor is twice as hard to escape. Slower, slower, slower. Holy. You put fire in there? Okay,
so to get out of that metal cage, you need to use the lock pick 
on the floor, hurry up. - Faster! 
- Darcy! Come on. Come on. Oh my gosh, come on. Even with a tool,
picking a lock takes some fidgeting. He has to perfectly align all three pins
inside the lock in order to break free. By the way, in order to prove this video 
is 100% real-time. starting now, you're going to see 
an unbroken shot of Darcy in the corner of the full video. And as of now, a minute has gone by
and he's still in the first room. And remember, he still needs to get through all five floors of this tower
and press the button in time... The button's right here. ...to keep his quarter
of a million dollars from exploding. I'm getting so much anxiety. Please go faster Wait, Mack, he's picking the lock. Is he making good time or not? So now, yeah, But he's about to go down
to an even more difficult room. Be careful. Don't catch a fire. Darcy, go. - Go! Go!
- Come on, what are you doing, bro? go. He's coming down the rope, he's in the glue room now. Welcome to floor number four. Come on. He's already made it 
to floor four. This is floor number four. - Ok.
- What is it? So this entire floor
is now covered in glue. He has to choose between monkey barring
or walking across the glue. And I would very much advise
he does not walk across the glue. So far so good on the monkey bars. Keep going, buddy. Come on. - Come on, Darcy do it!
- Let's do it. Two minutes has gone by. Go on your head, man. Oh, no. Why are you spinning? 
Stop spinning. If he falls, that is not good, because that is the stickiest
glue in the world. I'm not even joking,
he'll lose his shoes. Oh, yeah. It's already been 2 minutes. Dude, he's swinging. 
He didn't touch the ground once. The man is glueless.
He made it to the exit. Oh, yeah. He's about to lift up that lid. And now he's about to enter
the craziest room. Keep taking us down. Watch this. You're going to see him
jump down. Oh my God, boys, I'm so tired. Oh, Darcy's struggling, but he's making his way down 
the rope onto floor three, the boulder room. This one should be pretty simple. All right, Darcy,
See that giant boulder? Yes. Well, these two ropes are the only thing
preventing it from barreling down the ramp. There's also a machete. and let's just say 
you'll need it to get out of this room. You're losing time. what do you think you'd do with the knife? - I'm trying to cut these ropes.
- Cut that rope. You're running out of time. Normally in our videos, when someone 
does something this slow, we cut it out, but this is life. We literally can't cut it out.
I am freaking out. Seven minutes remain. He's almost through the first of two
ropes. This is like some James Bond stuff 
right here. As he goes lower, the floors are
going to get harder and take longer. He's actually not making as good
pace as you would want him to make. That rope is going to take him
the longest because of how thick it is. Cut the rope. - He's wasting a lot of time on this.
- He's behind right now. This knife is so dull. You're going to have to hurry. Under seven minutes remain 
before your $250,000 explodes. Bro is still cutting the rope. Jimmy, what's going
to happen here? When he cuts that second rope? Something crazy is going to happen. And Darcy, what do you think 
is going to happen when you cut that rope? All right, I guess Darcy's locked in. Jimmy, what is going to happen
when he cuts the rope? This boulder is going to go, 
I guess, through the window. - Tell me, please,
- All you need to do... - Yes.
- Is hold onto that when he cuts the rope. Okay, That's. That's. I can handle that. There's no way I'm losing this 250
grand because of this stupid rope. Jimmy, why did you find the slowest
man possible at cutting a rope? Darcy, hurry up. Like I told
you at the start, this is real time. You're seeing everything. Obviously,
Darcy's pretty occupied right now, but if you could talk to us,
he'd probably tell us about the fact that he's a world
class escape artist, but apparently is not the best
at cutting ropes. Darcy, you spent a whole minute on this. Oh, my God. Cut faster, come on. Bro, you have got to cut 
the rope a lot faster. Oh my gosh. Oh, he's about to finish the last
rope. Darcy, push the boulder down the ramp. So, the boulders is going to... - You'll see in a bit.
- Okay. He's pushing the boulder now. - Brace yourself.
- What the... Back up. - Keep going.
- What? Darcy, quick, 
grab that rope from the ceiling and attach it to the latch
on the front of your pants. Make 100% sure that it's connected. What is he going to do? All right, now, jump down. Step out to the edge
and turn around. - All right.
- Watch this. Watch what? Am I going to have to jump, Jimmy? Oh my God, he's about to jump. Go to your right.
Go to your right. What is he going to do? - What is he doing?
- He is about to jump. All right, Darcy,
you're going to have to jump down. Oh my God, how am I going to do this? - Let's go, Darcy.
- Darcy, jump. What the... Okay. He has exactly 5 minutes left. Stop the crane. Stop the crane, stop the crane, stop the crane. All right, I don't know, 
the crane operator is drunk. You got to make it through
the lasers. This floor is by far
the hardest yet. Not only does
he get to make it through this laser maze, if he accidentally touches a laser, his money will instantly explode. How am I going to do this?
There's so many lasers. While he's doing this laser room. I'm going to tell you guys about
T-Mobile, my new wireless partner. In here? - Mack.
- What? You probably know T-Mobile
from this coverage map. - Yes, I do. I do.
- But here's the thing. Okay. You know,
great coverage is to be expected. Okay. But what T-Mobile has 
that other carriers don't... Jimmy, he's halfway
through the lasers now. Oh, he's on our side.
But what makes T-Mobile special is they have something 
called Magenta Status. Okay. What is Magenta Status? It's where they treat
you like a VIP. Just by using T-Mobile, 
you can get a reduced cost at hotel rooms, you can get free in-flight Wi-Fi, 
access to VIP lounge. - Go, go, go.
- All right. T-Mobile, I'm stressing out. Sorry if I'm forgetting 
lines and a bunch of other stuff. - And the best part is, Mack...
- It's right there, Jimmy, yes. - Yes, let me finish the T-Mobile ad.
- Okay. And the best part is... 
He's jumping in the water. It's all available. Day one,
when you switch to T-Mobile. So, if you're not currently using T-Mobile,
start using now. You can get all these perks 
literally today. Let me just catch my breath here. See how at tmobile.com/status. Oh, he's in the water. Oh my God. All right, this is it, 
the last level. He now has to open the four valves
in each quarter of the room, allowing all the water to drain, Then he can escape out
the front door and hit the button
to save his money from blowing up. You got to turn these. Turn these things? - Turn.
- Turn the knob. What's he doing? Actually, don't help him. Let's see if he's smart enough 
to win the money. Will he be able to hold his breath
long enough to unscrew all four valves,
or will he run out of time? Did the water come out? Hey, he did it. While this guy is doing 
this intense challenge, I want tell you about the greatest
tasting chocolate on the planet. Feastables. Mack. What do you think of Feastables? Oh, it's my favorite. Oh no, he's going for the one 
he just finished. Hey, hey.
No, no. Do the other one, do the other one. - You got to keep going.
- There's four. How much time is left? Oh, three minutes. Yeah. He actually kind of
just wasted, like, 30 seconds. He could do this if you just hurries up. Come on, catch your breath, let's go. Mack, he's about to go under, 
go around this side, see if it opens. He didn't do it yet. He didn't do it yet. All right, keep turning. - Oh, he did it.
- Other side, other side. - Oh my God.
- Two down, two to go, baby. All right. He's now making
his way to the other side. - You got to go swim down.
- Oh my God This is coming down to the wire. I cannot imagine how absolutely
exhausted he is right now. Ok. All right, so he has two minutes 
and 10 seconds to, right over here, press that red button 
or his money will explode. It's coming down to the wire. You got it. You got it. I don't know what to do. Normally, we do cuts and edits,
but this is like real time. Everything I'm saying is making it. - Oh, he's got less than two minutes. Bro.
- There’s just two minutes. - Hey, less than two minutes.
- Go faster. He's getting close, he's getting close. He got it. He just did it, he got all four. He did it. All right, the final door,
a minute, 50 seconds. All right, what now? Now he has to open this door, run
and press the button. - How much time does he have?
- Just under 2 minutes. How is he going to pull this off? I don't get it. You're going to get wet if you stand there,
you might want to back up. Why? Open it. There is so much more water 
that still needs to drain. - All right, Mack, hey.
- Go faster. Mack, in case he fails, 
that bomb will blow up, so I need you to just, hide behind 
the sandbags over there if he messes up, - Okay?
- Okay. Just trust me. What do I do? You have to unscrew all the latches. Get him out of there, come on. Almost a minute, come on, come on. Bro... I don't know if he's
going to make it at this point. The door stuck because there's
too much water pressure. He needs to wait for it to drain
more. Wait, Jimmy, the water is starting
 to come out the front door. Turn it, turn it, turn it and pull it. Pull it. You got to go, buddy. 
You've got to go. He's stuck in that one, 
he can't get it. Something's wrong. Bro, this is it. 
He's going to fail. He can't figure out
how to open the door. He literally has 45 seconds 
to hit this button. It stuck, come on. Bro, he can't get these latches off 
to save his life. Bro... What is he doing? Come on. Come on. You got 30 seconds, 
come on, come on. Go! You have to slide through the door 
and hit the button. Go faster. Go. Go! - Come on.
- Come on. Hurry, before the bomb blows up. - Yeah!
- Yeah! And after he won with 19 seconds left, we cleared 
the money out of the way the bomb, and asked him
what he was going to spend it on. I'm having a baby tomorrow. What? And then we blew the building up. Oh Gosh. I hope you enjoy the explosion. We have to make this video 
exactly 10 minutes. Goodbye."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-nMKJ5J3Uc,"Ages 1 - 100 Decide Who Wins $250,000",2402,20240420,en,"- Once again, behind me are 100 people, and they range from the age of one all the way to age 100, and they're all gonna be competing for $250,000. Everyone go to your cubes, and unlike any of my past videos, these 100 people will decide themselves who deserves the 250 grand. Everybody, enter your cubes! The challenge has officially begun, if any of you decide to leave or even touch the red line, you will be eliminated. How far do you think you'll
make it in the challenge? - I intend to go the whole way. - All right, let's see how
the one-year-old's doing. Do you think you'll win the money? All right, have fun with the tablet. - This is the line that's gonna make it all the way to the end. - 48, feeling great. - It was clear from the beginning that the middle-aged people were the most focused and determined, but that didn't go for everybody. If you step out, you lose. Okay, the two-year-old is now eliminated. As you'd expect, the first to leave were the youngest, Did you have a good time? We'll ask in a year when he can speak, and some of the older folks. - Yes sir, I'm ready to go. - All right. - And already, by hour one of filming this video, six people have been eliminated, and even more are about to be. Unlike this video right here, that was more of a last to leave, this challenge is about making friendships and convincing people to like you. They decide who wins the 250 grand and I didn't know it yet, but this video was by far the most intense video we've ever filmed. - Shame on you! - Are you serious? - You're a kind person, don't eliminate me. - Attention everybody, over the past hour I hope you've all had a chance to make some friends because you're going to need them. Throw 10 minutes on the board. In the next 10 minutes, I need 10 of you to leave. - Literally can't. - And ultimately it is your
responsibility as a group to convince 10 people to leave their queue, and if you're not able to accomplish this, we're gonna randomly eliminate 25 of you. Good luck. - My gosh, I don't wanna do the 25 random. - We need somebody to leave! - I'm not leaving! - If you're past retirement age, you gotta go, if you are not above the age of 12, you gotta go! - Already a minute's gone by and no one's left. - If seven people leave with me, I'll go out! - Please! - Help!
- Please! - I cannot be kicked out this soon. - Please, guys! - Kids, you can come out! You gonna take one for the team? - I can't do it, I came here for the long haul. - Yo, do it for the greater good! - 53, go! - No.
- No! - Are you gonna get out? I'll buy you Roblox, I promise. We have one, we have one! - And even though 89 decided to take one for the team, we still need eight more people. Nobody, no takers? - Not to be rude, but like all the older
people should leave, they got like retirement money. I'm in college, I'm struggling right now. - Five, four, three, two, one! - You all were unfortunately not able to come to an agreement, which means a random
group of 25 contestants will now be eliminated and to ensure it's random, we're using this machine to pick the contestants
we're going to eliminate one by one. Chandler, grab a ping pong ball. Our first elimination is Number 18. - Oh, that sucks. - Please, almost, no! - The next elimination is 85. Remember, you guys chose this. 82.
- Oh. - Number 80. - I'm sorry, boss. - Okay. - 99. Don't worry,
we only have 19 more balls to go. 12, 24, 22, 19. - Oh, this is brutal. - 29.
- Boom. - I'm sorry, son. - And our final elimination, it was 13!
- Oh, oh. - Chandler, look at all
the people you eliminated. I'm sorry. - We just lost 25 people. - Grateful that it's not me, though. - Still here, but I don't know if I feel good about it. - Every number that came out, ""Is that gonna be me? Is that gonna be me? Am I going home today?"" - 67 of you remain, congratulations! And as always, once someone is eliminated, we obviously destroy their cube. and after the onslaught
from the last challenge, I thought I'd give them
some time to recover and so I let them hang out
in their cubes for a bit, which ended up being a
challenge of its own. - Hey, if you don't wanna spend the night, all you gotta do is just
step outta this cube. - That's what I'm gonna do. - Because by the time Day Two started, so many people had been eliminated, we were already down to 55 contestants remaining. We're gonna start the new day by seeing if you can all unanimously agree on who should win this $250,000. If all of you can agree on the same person, they instantly win the $250,000, but if only one of you vote for someone different, we're gonna do a challenge and eliminate a bunch of you. Who do you think should win the 250 grand? - 14. - Who do you think
should win the 250 grand? - 11. All right, well it's already ruined. You all cannot unanimously agree on who should win that money, so we have to do a challenge. Each row now has to decide on a captain and that captain will then represent all the contestants in their row for the next challenge. Please make sure you
trust whoever you pick, it will all make sense, but it's gonna be very ruthless. For the next 15 minutes each row tried to decide who their captain was going to be. - Do you wanna be the captain? - If you don't want to. - As long as you choose
to not sacrifice us. - I will not get y'all out. - What age do you want
to represent your row? - 30. - 30.
- 30. - We got it! - Hey, do one of y'all volunteer? - I volunteer. - 64.
- I'm okay with 64. - Who in your row do
you want to be captain? - Me. I came here to fight for this thing and I'm gonna win it. - All right, your captains have been chosen. This is where things get interesting and a little cutthroat. We're gonna offer money and if any of you captains
take the money we offer, you and your entire row are completely eliminated. My first offer is a $1,000. - Stay tough, 42! - I ain't going nowhere. I'm not eliminating my row for $1,000. - I'm not moving! - 14, please don't. - Y'all are safe, I'm not doing it. - Offer Number Two, $5,000. - Don't do it! - If one of you step out, eliminate your entire row, I will give you this $5,000. - No, 42! - Don't eliminate us, 42! - Don't expect me to go
anywhere for a while. - Don't do it, 30!
- I just hope my wife agrees with every decision I make. - Our next offer is $10,000. - Don't do it! - 10 grand isn't worth
hurting these people, I like them a lot more than 10 grand. - 20 grand. We're going until one of you step out. - That ain't enough, that ain't enough. - We're now at $50,000. At this point, all the captains have been holding strong, but it was clear once we
had $50,000 on the line, some of the captains were having a harder time than others. - Don't do it, 42! - Geez. - All right everybody, let's really have some fun. The next offer is, that puts us at $80, that puts us at $90, we're not done, put it up there. The new offer is $100,000 for the first captain to step out of their cube. 14, 30, 42, 64 or Mr. 100, I just need one of you five to step out so I can make you rich. - No, 30! - Really starting to
feel the pressure now. - No, 42! - Dude, I'm gonna be hated on so bad. - Oh, I see 30
about to crack over there. - Don't move! - Don't you dare! - Oh, he's doing it! - I'm doing it.
- Oh, oh! - I'm sorry. - Are you serious? 30, what the heck! - I'm shocked. - Shame on you, Shame on you! - That's crazy. - 30 has stepped out, All of the 20's and all of the 30's are now eliminated. You guys should have picked
a better team captain. - I can't, I can't look. I gotta think of my son. - You lied, 30! - This line right here- - This is the line that's gonna make it all the way to the end. - Everyone in the 20's, you can leave, everyone in the 30's, you're all eliminated, I'm sorry. - What's going through
your head right now? - That we got screwed! - I kept thinking, like, that sets my kid up for a long, long time. - Because of how much betrayal has been shown so far in this video, the 40's made an alliance to try to keep any of them from getting out, no matter what. - 40 alliance hung together, there's four of us. - It's that time again, cast up your votes and see if you can all decide on a winner, and like usual, they couldn't agree. So, we'll do a challenge and eliminate some more people. I'll be right back. The next challenge
involves a spinning wheel that has all the remaining
contestants ages on it. So go ahead, Chandler, spin it. Currently there are 36 of you remaining and we're gonna spin the wheel until we eliminate 16 of
you with this challenge, bringing your total down to the final 20. All right, 67, I'm coming to your cube, and while I'm walking over to his cube, Chandler, spin it again. That wheel is going to land
on another person's age and when it does, you're going to have to decide whether or not to eliminate them. - 55. - The challenge is simple, 67, you could choose if 55 is eliminated or stays in the challenge. - Before you decide, it's only fair that 55
gets to say his piece. - Thank you everybody, it's been a great time, good luck, guys. - You don't wanna ask to kindly not be eliminated or anything? - No, 'cause if I was
in the same position, I'd do the same thing. - I mean, he's giving you
a pass to eliminate him. - Uh-
- His choice. - Wow, okay. - Somebody's got to go- - So, is that saying
you wanna eliminate him? - Yes. - Okay, the decision is final then. - All right.
- Sorry, boss. - Thanks, guys. - Chandler, spin the wheel. - I mean, he gave me the
leeway to let him go. - That was an easy first one, surely they'll all go that well. Ooh, 47, now we're gonna give her
a chance to talk to you before you make a decision. - Have peace of mind, I would love to stay, I don't wanna go. - What is your decision? - She'll stay. - You survived.
- Ooh, ooh! - And because she did not get eliminated, she now decides who stays and who goes. Technically you could
eliminate the next 15 people and be safe. No risk of elimination, but that'd be very cruel. - It would be. - 43. - Would love to stay on our little team, but it's ultimately up to you. - We're staying together. 43 is staying.
- Woo! Love you girl! - The 40's alliance was
determined to hold strong. - You know what this means, right? Now you are in charge. - You are one lucky person. Chandler, spin the wheel! 66. - Oh.
- All right. - Right over there. - 43, I know it's a hard decision for you, but I'd like to stay. - Oh, that's gonna make me cry. - If you let her stay, she gets control. - Oh.
- It's up to you. - 66, you are so sweet and it's been a pleasure
getting to know you, unfortunately in this game we're trying to stick together and I've enjoyed you but unfortunately you're eliminated. - Thank you, thank you everybody, it's okay. it's okay. - Thank you for coming out, 66. Oh, brutal. - I'm so proud of you. - With 42's influence over 43- - We gotta keep control or we'll be eliminated. - We're at war.
- I know. - Nobody outside
the 40's was safe. 57. - I mean, you don't even know 57. - 57 you're eliminated. - 40's, watch out for the 50's 'cause they'll come back after you. - 65. - Oh, that's me. - It's for the game and I'm sorry, you've also been eliminated. - Oh! - She just took 65 out of the game and I know it's breaking her heart, I know it is, but we cannot lose control. - 43 knows that if she
stops eliminating people and gives up control of the wheel, the next person could
potentially eliminate her. That's a big one. This means a lot to Gio. Don't take this decision lightly. - Is it, is that 11? - Gio, don't cry yet, it's not over. I want you to listen to me very carefully, the next few seconds determine a lot. I'm gonna hand you this mic and it's up to you to convince that person not to eliminate you. Do you understand? - You are a kind person and you are kind enough
to not eliminate me. - Save Gio!
- Save Gio! - Save Gio! - Save Gio! Save Gio! - Oh, my gosh. - Don't do it. Now is not the time to
develop a heart, okay? - Okay. Gio, I admire you so much-
- Yes. - You are literally the coolest
11-year-old I've ever seen. You've got tons of energy and spunk and your future is super bright, but unfortunately your time here is over. I'm so, so sorry. - All right. - Everyone was absolutely speechless. Everyone, round of applause. I felt so bad about this elimination that I actually had age 11 come up and help me on stage. Give it up for Gio.
- Gio! - At this point, everyone outside of the 40's knew they were in big trouble. - She's gonna eliminate everybody. - If you're not on 40, you're gone. - Once again, I don't think
it's safe for our side at all. - 17. - 17, unfortunately you are eliminated. - Thanks. - The 16-year-old. - I have a great-grandmother, she's not doing too good health-wise. - I'm so sorry, but you're also eliminated, 16. - Ah, wow. - I am so proud of you, I'm so proud of you. - Believe it or not, for some reason the wheel just kept missing the 40's alliance. - 52. - You're eliminated. - Oh, my God. - Until this one, and now the hardest decision of the challenge. Are you gonna eliminate yourself? - I think I'm gonna keep spinning, Jimmy. - Okay, give us another spin. - You've also been eliminated. - Ooh. - Unfortunately you are eliminated. - All right, 75. - Brutal. - 62. - See ya, you ain't even gotta say nothing, bye. - 62, you don't even wanna at least try to convince her? - Nope, bye. - Hey 62, I just wanna let you know I'm gonna miss your snoring. - What did you say, villain? - I said I'm gonna miss your snoring. - I'm not mad at you. 43, no, I started feeling your pain, but you're just cruel. - I miss you already. - Bye, y'all. - Without even making 43 decide, 62 left her cube and with only one elimination left, let's see who their
next victim is gonna be. All right, it landed on Feastables, that means all of you get the world's best chocolate. - Milk Crunch, that's my favorite. - Oh, Crunch. Thank you, Jimmy.
- No problem. Even though he's eliminated, we'll still honor him. Make sure you go to Walmart and try our brand new formula. Anyways, when the wheel finally landed on someone else in the 40's alliance- - 41, I love you and that's why I'm
gonna pass it on to you. - We finally have somebody new. Depending on who it lands on, this just might be our last spin. - All right, Mr 100, do you have anything to say to the person attempting to eliminate you? - I hope that you will not eliminate me and I ask you not to vote me out. - Mr. 100, I am so sorry, God bless you, I hope that everything works out for you. <i>Adiós.</i> - Oh, no. - I understand your response and I congratulate you on what you do. - Let's give it up for age 100. - Everyone was absolutely heartbroken to see our oldest contestant be eliminated and because he was
clearly a crowd favorite, I couldn't let him leave without something extra. I'll give you $20,000 for coming out and competing. - Thank you, I've enjoyed being with you. - It's been brutal, we just watch a lot of people get eliminated, I know everyone's probably
very sad right now. - Specifically 43. - Eliminated, eliminated, eliminated, eliminated, eliminated. - We don't need to say specific numbers. - True. - How do you
feel after the challenge? - I've lost the love for the 40's, I'll say it out loud, they decimated my group. - The 50's don't seem to like you guys. - 'Cause we knocked half of 'em out. If they had gotten the mic, they would've knocked half of us out. - I agree. - The moral of the story is trust no one. - And after letting the contestants recover for a few hours, we held another vote to see if they could decide on a winner. Looks like literally none of you can agree on anything. It's time for another challenge! It'll be intense. - Good. - If you look over here, you'll see $250,000, not to be confused with
the other $250,000, and one of you could walk out with this one right now. - What? - Oh, Lord. - But before I tell you how, we need to black out all your rooms, bring in the curtains! - He doesn't want us
talking to each other. - Which is tough 'cause we're such a strong team, so- - That really antes up the stakes a bit. - We have officially
blacked out all 20 cubes. If only one of you voluntarily step out and eliminate yourself, you win this $250,000, but if any more than one of you try to go for it, you'll be eliminated and win nothing. The timer has started, let's see if someone wins $250,000. - I literally missed
out on $100,000 today, this time I'm gonna get
exactly what I came here for. Just letting you know, I will be stepping out, so if you wanna join me, then we can be losers together! - I think I might do it. - 64, you going?
- Yep! - Well, if you go and 42 goes, you don't get nothing! - That's right! - It was abundantly clear that age 42 was going to do everything in his power to secure this challenge's prize money for himself, which means while they're deciding if they wanna step out of their cubes, I wanna tell you guys about ""Top Troops"". ""Top Troops"" is a free to play mobile game where you battle enemies, conquer lands, and unlock new characters. - Are you in this game? - I haven't got to that talking point yet. - My bad. - With Top Troops, I can literally train my own army to fight in massive epic battles. That right there, Mack, is actually my very own
character in Top Troops. - He's really handsome. - I am, bro, I'm in a video
game, and for the next 14 days to test out my character, they gave me my own battle challenge. My new character can literally
lower the enemy's damage and if you use it in my challenge, it gets even more powerful. - That's pretty cool. - Download Top Troops now by using the link in the description or lemme see that, scan the QR code on
Nolan's face right now. For a limited time you get a king's chest and 15 shards on me to help unlock exclusive troops. - Please get this thing off my face. - I got you. - Please. Oh. - I'm walking out. - 60 seconds left! - There's only still one person out. He's literally gonna win
the same amount of money as the grand prize. - Someone can leave
with this money right now and if you do decide to leave, you must remain silent. - Nobody's gotten out on this side. As of right now, 42 is gonna walk away with a quarter of a million dollars. - 50's, hanging tight? - Like a rock! - Casey, you sticking? - Casey's staying. - All right, bud. - Three, two, step out now or forever hold your peace. One, time is up! Let's see if someone just won a quarter of a million dollars! Guards, drop the curtains! If you look around, you'll see that 42 was the only one to step out. - Until two seconds remained and someone all the way
over there stepped out at the last second. - Oh, my God!
- What? - Sorry, 42. - As they say, ""Go big or go home."" - 40's just lost their leader. - Oh. - And you guys are still playing, just remember that. - This is tough. - You both have rolled the dice and it didn't work out. - I made my voice very loud and clear and you knew what was gonna happen, so you basically said, ""Money, I don't like you."" - It happens.
- That's okay. - I think that's enough stress for today, make sure you make lots
of friends tonight. - My neighbor is gone now. - I made it very, very,
very loud and clear, with my voice telling everyone, ""Listen, there's only one winner here."" It seemed to have worked until the last two seconds. - Sorry, two seconds count. My decision was made
before the clock started. - It looks like the
50's were not so quickly going to forget the damage that they took yesterday. - All I gotta say, 40's, watch out for the '50's, 'cause they'll come back after you. - And thanks again to ""Top Troops"" for making this video possible, make sure to go download it after you finish the video. So far, 82 people have been eliminated from this challenge, but we're not slowing down anytime soon. Good morning, everybody, do you think you're all gonna agree on who should win the 250 grand? - Maybe. - Throw the votes up on the tablets, surely everyone voted for the same person. - Let's be honest, should I just get the
next challenge ready? - Yeah.
- Yeah, I figured. - It's getting less unanimous as we have less people. All right, time for the next challenge, bring out the briefcases! At this point, all the
people older than 40 began to pick up on what
the next challenge was. - There are cases with numbers on 'em, like ""Deal Or No Deal"". - Oh my goodness, this is ""Deal Or No Deal"", I think it. - It almost looks like
the ""Deal Or No Deal"". Um... - Our next challenge looks really similar to the very popular show ""Deal Or No Deal"", and so we brought out the
face of the show himself, Howie Mandel. - Oh wow!
- What up, Howie! - Everyone over
40 really loved How. - Thank you, please. - 14-year-old, you might not have seen it. - Do you know me? - Wait, wait, wait, I might know some of, is it music, are you a music artist? - And if you're also under the age of 40 and haven't seen ""Deal Or No Deal"", don't worry, I'll explain the rules along the way. If you look at those 18
briefcases over there, half say eliminated and half say safe. I need you to pick a number. - 14? - Makes sense. Open this briefcase where no one else, including me, can see what's inside. Do you know what's inside? - Yes. - Who is the next youngest person here? - [41] I think it's me! - All right, now I'm going
to 41. 41 now has the option to steal 14's briefcase for herself or choose at random one of
the remaining briefcases. Let's see how well they're
able to read each other. - Hey, what's in the case, Number 14? - It says safe. - I'll steal it from you. 41, open the case. - I love it, he's having such a good time. - No, I am, this is like I'm reminiscing. Open the case. - Safe!
- Oh! Wow. Why wouldn't he just lie and keep his safe case? That means everyone's odds just got worse. It's time to pick a new briefcase, what number will it be? - 13. - Lucky 13. - Onto our next
youngest contestant, age 43.
- Hey, 14, what you got in your suitcase? - It says eliminated. - Ooh. - I-
- I'm gonna be honest, at this point I didn't even know if he was telling the truth or not. - 14, do you pinky swear
that it says not safe? - It says not safe. - Whoa, is this a strategy? - I think I'm gonna pick
my own suitcase today. - 14, open your briefcase! - All right. - Eliminated. - Oh, 14.
- Oh, no. - I'm so sorry, buddy. - Also another person on your elimination list, it never ends with her. - See ya, buddy, you're the best.
- Thank you. So, I wanted to be honest and I was and I got eliminated. I feel like what I did
was the right thing. - There are 16 brief cases, pick your number. - I'm gonna go with lucky number three. - We don't even need a
microphone for this one, they're side by side. - We still have an alliance, you can trust me or not. If you are safe, I'm gonna let you keep your briefcase. Are you safe? - I am not safe. - Ah, now I have to
make the hard decision. No steal.
- Okay. He chose not to steal 43's briefcase. Open it up for us. If she is lying and this case does in fact say safe, the 40's will not be able to
trust each other any longer and their alliance will be broken. - Oh!
- Oh. - That is a strong alliance, I'm so sorry, 43. - We love you, 43! - This is almost worse than being buried. - It's definitely worse. 15 cases are left and only eight of them are safe. - I'm going to tell you
the truth, I'm eliminated. - I'm just gonna go with the fates. 44, he is eliminated. - This is brutal. - Good luck, man. - Pick whatever number you want. - 10. - 10.
- Make sure no one sees it. - I didn't walk in here with money, I walked in here with integrity, it's says safe. - Are you telling the truth? - You are making the
biggest choice of your life. - Whoa, he adds suspense.
- And that is, steal or no steal? - I'm gonna take it. - There's no turning back, your future lies inside this case. - I can't, ah. - Open the case. - Oh! She was telling the truth. - Thank you so much. - Let's see if at some point she decides to move on herself. - No. - What do you want him
to think is in your case? - Eliminated. - I'm gonna believe you and let you keep your case then. - Open the case. - While her honesty did in fact get her eliminated, it did save two of the people in her alliance.
- Thank you. - Are you honest, 48? - I've always been honest with you, 51, you know that. I'm gonna make it easy for you, it says eliminated. - Howie, I got this one. Steal or no steal? - I love that! - Anyways, quarter mill on the line, 51? - I am going to not steal. - Let's see if 48 was telling the truth. Three, two, one! - He was lying! Well played, that was well played! - I hope you all learned. - That's how you lie, folks. - You made it to the top nine, let's see if 51 does, as well. 17, Howie, here we go, 17 is coming up. - I'm gonna trust whatever he says. - It says eliminated. - Steal or no steal? - No steal. - No steal, all right, let's show her. - He was honest. - 51, you're now eliminated. - That sucked. - Even though 54 just dodged a bullet, she's now faced with an elimination. - Hi 54, I am ready. - I'm honestly gonna tell you that in box number seven, it says eliminated. - I know you are giving
my ticket outta here because you won't lie to me. - This is a tough decision, steal or no steal? - And now I feel like
there's a whole world sitting on my shoulders right now. Um, ah, steal. - All right. - Even though she said it has eliminate, you're gonna steal it? - That that is what I said, yes, steal. - He's jumping
on a grenade for her. - Do you believe her? - Uh, I do, I want the best for her. I mean, I'll see my grandchildren. - Oh, my gosh. Wow, that might be the most selfless thing I've ever witnessed in my life. - I feel like I'm gonna
trip over this thing. You gave me the easiest
choice I have made. - God will bless you. - You have a chance to give something, give that to that person and I did win, I met Howie Mandel. - And when faced with
yet another elimination case, she chose honesty a second time. - I'm just gonna tell you
that it says eliminated. - No, I'm not gonna steal it. - As the game neared it's end, we were running out of safe briefcases. - I got one of the safe boxes. - I'd like to steal, I believe him. What? - Oh. - Oh, no! - And once we got to the
final two briefcases, we had no idea if they were going to lie or tell the truth. It's between 67 and 96, one is safe and one is eliminate. Do you wanna pick the briefcase or do you want 96 to pick the briefcase? - Go for it, 96. - It's amazing that you're here, I hope I have the energy
at your age that you have. - And I wanna downhill ski next year. - Okay. Which case do you want? - 16.
- 16 it is. - We're gonna
open and look at the case so nobody else can see it. - What's in the case, 96? - Eliminate. - My dad is 96 years old, he done told a whole lotta lies. - Do you want to
take the last case on stage or steal 96's case? - No steal. - And because these are
our final two briefcases, we're gonna take the drama up a notch and open them both at the same time to see who's moving on. Top nine for $250,000, I'm gonna give us a countdown, three, two, one. - You're staying. We're staying! - The 96-year-old lied. - I'm alive and kicking. - That is why he's the oldest person left in this challenge.
- Woo! - And with that, we are now down to the top nine. The next challenge will be even crazier. - It's end game, we're down to the final nine. I am planning on winning this game. - Super nervous. - 40's alliance holding strong, woo! - Emotions are running high, I think it's gonna get pretty crazy soon. - And as we rolled into
the final day of this video, the contestants trust for each other was running thin. - Welcome to my humble abode. - Around you is
just a sea of red X's. - A sea of blood. - Do you trust those people
over there on the other side? - No, I don't. - Out of every single
person left in this room- - Okay?
- Who do you trust the most? - 47, 100%. When we got into this
it was entirely about, ""Let's see how far the two of us can get"", and if it ends up being
the last two of us, that would be amazing. - What's your strategy? - I don't have a strategy. - Since you cannot agree on who wins that giant
wad of cash over there, you are now going to choose four people to eliminate from this competition. The way that you'll decide is simple, all of you will tell the room why you think you deserve the prize money, and as a group you'll have to decide whose story is worthy and not worthy for continuing this challenge. Every decision you have
made this entire video leads to this moment. Let 'em know what you'll
spend the money on. - I've got a son who's got pretty significant special needs. - We leave everything back
in our country, Philippines. - I have no health insurance, I have horrific neuropathy. - My cousin, she has lupus, so I wanna help her, she has three little ones. - This is so hard, y'all, I also have an autistic,
nonverbal daughter who will be seven at the end of the month, she needs so much work and we've got so far to go. - No, I'm crying for everybody, it breaks my heart. Just wanna give all my
money away to everybody. - How can we possibly rank somebody's wishes and hopes higher than anyone else's? - Invest the money for 90 to 120 days on my mining platform. - It's so unfair to say, ""Well, your charity's not as important as this or that"", it doesn't seem fair. - Almost lost his business
during the pandemic- - We'll vote one at a time
for who's not moving on. - Okay.
- Okay, let's start with the obvious. - I wanna give it to my daughter 'cause I'm living with her. She took me in when I could not- - This is getting harder and harder the longer it goes. Let's make our decision to move on because it's not getting any easier. - Now that you've heard
each other's stories and now it is up to all of you to decide who will stay and who will go. - I dunno what to do.
- Let's start with 61. - The people on this side of the room have decided on 61. - After hearing everybody's stories, it's time to see who
you collectively think should go home. Reveal the results. Wow. - Who was it?
- Aw, 61. - That's me. - She's a troublemaker, you know what, so long, goodbye. - Three more competitors
need to be voted out, it is up to you to decide. - I don't know what I'm gonna do. - We can do 46 if we need to. Do it now.
- Oh. - 46, he wasn't very convincing with much. - The votes are in, all right. - Nervous? - Extremely, I'm about to knife my alliance. - You voted, let's see the results. Every vote was on a 40-year-old. I thought you all had an alliance? - Bro. - Whoa, all right. 46, you have been eliminated. - I cannot believe that just happened, the entire 40 year old's
alliance just imploded. - Who's next? 96. - I can't do this anymore. - Let's see what you all decided. Whoa, 96 year old. - Good luck and I thank everybody, I'm happy I was on this show. - The final vote coming up. - 72? Do it now. - We're ready for the last
elimination of this challenge and this time I'm gonna have you tell me what number you voted for. Who did you vote for? - I voted for 72. - One vote for 72. - She's a sweetheart. - 72, who did you vote for? - 41. - One vote for 41. Who did you vote for? - I voted for 72, so we're even 72. - Who did you vote for and why? - I voted for 41, it was more wants and dreams- - I will help my twin
sister to get a house- - Instead of needs. - That ties it up. Who did you vote for?
- 72. That's three votes for 72 and two votes for 41. The deciding factor here, who did you vote for? - 72? Do it now. - I voted for 72. - That means 72 received
the majority of votes. I'm sorry, you are eliminated. - Only one person gets that money. - Unfortunately, we knew we had to make some cuts at some point. - It's now time to play the game. - Attention final contestants, again and again you have failed to unanimously vote for a winner and now you no longer have a choice. I don't like that you
guys are so far apart, especially 56 over here, doesn't feel fair, so boys, I think it's finally time to reveal the biggest
twist in this whole video. For the first time since this video began, you may now exit your cubes, you will not be eliminated, and make your way down to the giant cube for your final challenge.
- Wait, I was just in a cube. - As I've been saying this entire video, the decision of who wins this money is ultimately up to you, so we're gonna throw an
hour up on the screen and when that hits zero, whoever's left in this cube will win the $250,000, and if for some reason
there's more than one person, boys, come on out. You'll notice Mack and Tareq
are holding flamethrowers and they will not hesitate to engulf this money in
flames upon my command. Time is ticking, best of luck. - Only one of us is walking
away with that money. - I feel like there is not one person here above anyone else.
- Amen. - That goes from one to 100. - We all deserve this money. - It's not deserve, it's win the game. - Any thoughts? - If we cannot agree in one person, then we gotta find ways to get there. - Any ideas on that? - I would've much rather
they told us what to do. - Is anyone willing to leave? - That is a fair question. - I just thought I'd throw that out there, why not? We haven't discussed that.
- Mm-hm. - So, none of us wanna leave? - So, I'm kind of at a
disadvantage with y'all, I don't know your story. - If she tells you her story, that money's gonna burn. - But my story is me, my story's my life! - I have struggles, she has struggles.
- I have struggles. - So, do we not wanna share anything or do we just make it
as we know right now? - We can't share, we got 15 minutes-
- We only have- - We're just killing time right now. - Time is dwindling, someone needs to start leaving now. - I can't breathe, I'd just rather walk out. - Don't, you deserve to be here just as any of us. - If you're not strong enough to sit there and say that I can stay, I don't see how you can vote somebody out. - This isn't a fight, okay, this is life.
- It is life. - Do I wanna pick you out? No, I don't want to. - You're not the one that can't handle it and wants to walk out. - But I'm not gonna let her walk and that's it. - All five are still in the cube. I can literally feel the intensity. - What about ranked choice voting? - Quickly write down in paper what ranking looks like. - This is how it would look. - 48's idea is pretty simple, everyone chooses in order who they think deserves the money the most and whoever appears at the top of all of the lists the most consistently will win the money. - So it would just be
one vote and we're done, that's ranked choice voting. - I'd say we do that. - Do you wanna collect them and tally it? - That's what I'm doing, if you wanna come over and show
me, then I'll start writing. All right, we're ready. - You've come to a conclusion?
- Yes. - Whenever you guys are ready, feel free to step out. - 56 was in fifth place, 41 and 64 tied for third- - Oh, my God.
- I knew it. - Come on sister, I need somebody to hold on to anyway. - And now it's
come down to 47 and 48, who have had the strongest alliance in this whole video since the very first day, but as you know, only one of them can win this $250,000. - I came in second. - 47 is our winner. - That's crazy. Thank you, Jesus, Thank you, Lord. - Congratulations, 47. You struggled to eliminate other players, you built the strongest alliance and even to the very end, you fought for those around you- - I'm not gonna let her walk. - That is why 100 people
ultimately decided that that is your $250,000 and don't worry, all four of them are gonna walk away with $10,000. - It's been absolutely amazing. - This is crazy. - 47, we have one final surprise for you! Come on out. - Mommy! - You made it, sweetie! - Yeah! I can finally help you, Mom! - Oh, yeah.
- I can finally help you. - This was definitely one of my favorite videos to film. Let me know in the comments if you enjoyed the longer video format, we're trying it out to prepare for our Amazon Prime show
dropping later this year, but I'll tell you more
about that later on."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erLbbextvlY,7 Days Stranded On An Island,1346,20240330,en,"We are now stranded on this deserted
island in the middle of the ocean, and we're going to be stranded here
for the next seven days. And that boat that just left
was our only way out of here. - Why do we keep doing this?
- I thought it'd be fun. Despite its beauty, civilization has not been able to survive
on this island for over 250 years. But for the next seven days,
we're going to try to. And we only have around 4 hours
until it gets dark. It's hot out here. We need to build a shelter
immediately. I mean, why don't we just camp here?
This spot looks pretty good. So I say we kick things off by us
going and looking for wood. And you two... - We'll prep camp.
- Yes. Have fun with that.
Come on Shawn, come on Chandler. - How do we prep camp?
- You know, I don't know. And so we immediately got to work. But we had to be careful, because above you
is the most dangerous tree on earth. It contains poisonous tree sap
that can literally kill you. Why are we still standing here? And meanwhile,
Nolan and Mack were making a fire pit. I'd say it's a pretty good fire,
would you say? Well, it's not a fire yet. Well, I'd say
it's a pretty good fireplace. And Shawn started
constructing the frame for a shelter. Are you sure
that's not going to fall on us? Yeah. - I feel like Shawn's a survival dad.
- I've been called worse. And while
gathering some more materials, we came across
some wildlife on the island. Bro,
look at these chickens over here. Hey, wait! Stop running away. It wasn't long until I found out
why the chickens were afraid of us. Hey, what are we doing over here? Wait. What is that? Oh, it's a knife. Were you going to try to kill
one of those chickens? - Please let me eat the chicken.
- We don't kill chickens. Jimmy, what'd you eat for dinner
before you got here? Don't ask. We spent the rest
of the day one preparing our camp, which was pretty simple. I'm going to show
you guys around the camp. This is the fire where we're going
to make food. Come over here. And this is where we sleep. That concludes the tour. We pulled over our survival crate,
which contains food, water and most importantly,
a flare in case someone gets hurt. And by the time the sun went down,
we had everything figured out. Except for one thing Wait, hold up. Isn't sunscreen flammable? It's the end of day one. And I'm already starting
to get a little sunburned. I'm hoping to get some good sleep tonight. And I hope it doesn't
rain. Tomorrow we need to build a bigger shelter. And by we, I mean dad over there is
gonna build a bigger shelter. - I got you.
- I got... Oh. Jimmy, you're like mom,
Shawn's dad. I'm just going to go to bed. I'll see you on day two. During the first night of sleep,
we tossed and turned a lot. And by we, I mean me. So it was a good thing
we were fixing this the next day. The objective for day two is simple. We need to build a bigger
and rain proof shelter. We need more comfortable seats
because my butt hurts and we need a better fire pit. My butt also hurts. We're looking for very long,
sturdy sticks we can put across the top
of our shelter. That way, when it rains instead of it
drooping in the leaves and tarp, it flows off the back. And while we were busy gathering
resources for our new shelter, Mack and Nolan we're busy
looking for new seats. - Do you see that?
- Yeah. What's that orange thing? I mean, you could use it
as like a bouncy seat. Dude, it's a buoy. Oh dude, there's a net. We could use a net to catch chickens. Oh, a lot of bugs, a lot of bugs. A lot of bugs. Jimmy, we found an ocean buoy.
It's like a bouncy seat. - Did you steal this?
- No. Did he steal it? It washed up on a beach. I guess that's not stealing. Oh, that is nice.
Ok, I'll take it.  For the rest of the day, Chandler, Shawn
and I finished upgrading the shelter. Keep going. Keep going. There's still sun in here,
but it's because the sun's super low. 90% of the time,
this will be shade now. While Mack and Nolan got coconuts. - All right.
- Be careful, it's a big knife. Coconut. That's good. And, of course, trying to catch
chickens. Hey chickens, run, run, run away. What are you doing? All right. I saved them. Day two is coming to an end. How would you say it was? I'm tired, but I'm doing good. - Nolan?
- Fantastic. I think we can all agree we are doing way
better than we thought we would. But little did I know. Later that night, things
were about to get a whole lot worse. But for now, if you're wondering why
we're in the ocean, look at Chandler. Because it's
the only way for us to shower. We need our other water for cooking and you know, not dying of dehydration. You want to know what I noticed,
boys? What's that? We had ten carts of water,
and now we're down to six. It's day two. I know. I'm going to be the adult here and just say it. Everyone needs to be more responsible
with their water consumption. I agree. Wait, what are we agreeing to? - Shawn, I agreed for you.
- Okay, perfect. It's also dark, we need to go to bed. In case you didn't piece it together. That guy Mack is the guy
that lost money in this video. And this video. He's basically lost $1.5 million on
the channel in the last two months. It's a harsh way to introduce
somebody. Even though we upgraded our shelter, the second night of sleep was worse
than the first. We didn't know it,
but this island was infested with bugs that ended up
biting us all throughout the night. And for whatever reason,
Chandler and I got the worst of it. I got no sleep last night. Probably the most miserable thing
I've ever done Look how many bug bites
I have on just my hand alone. Do you see that? And while we caught up
on some much needed sleep, you can probably guess what the boys
are going to do without supervision. Catch chickens. No, let's catch fish. So yesterday, over by that debris on the
beach, me and Nolan found a bunch of net. Today, the boys are going to help me
make a chicken trap. The plan is basically
to put a giant net right here tied to a string up there, and then catch a chicken. Let's go. Now, if I was awake to stop them,
this never would have happened. But given the fact that I felt like
I was literally dying in this moment. The boys were officially going rogue. That is a strong net. Is that? There we go. Over the next 30 minutes or so, the
boys cut the net into a perfect square. They then hoisted the rope up
over the tree, tied the rope to all four corners,
and it was ready. That works. That's pretty nice. So after a quick reset
and placing some bait, it was time to catch a chicken. - What is this?
- Trap to catch chickens with? - Can I see the rope?
-  No, you cannot. Is that what you guys are doing
this whole time? - Yeah.
- Yeah. Thought you were doing
something actually productive. I'll be honest. At first, this seemed
like a complete waste of time, because for the next 3 hours,
they waited and waited, But for some reason, Mack in particular
was not ready to give up. And finally, after
even more waiting... Yeah. Keep it tight, keep it tight. Keep it tight. Mack, what is that? Jimmy, I caught it. Oh, this chick is actually
pretty chill. Yeah. This is the new Bryan
in honor of the bird from raft You know what? With how nice you've been, I'm
sure once you put Bryan down, it'll continue to hang out with us. Put it down. Time to put Bryan down. Bryan, no, Bryan. What did you do to Bryan? I thought he was our friend. Well,
I did catch him with a trap, so. And by the time Bryan had been caught
and freed, it had gotten significantly
less hot outside, which honestly gave all of us enough
energy for a spontaneous adventure. See that island behind me? - We're about to go to it Mack.
- Let's do it. Now I know what you're thinking. Why swim away from a perfectly good island
to a rock in the middle of the ocean? And honestly,
I don't have a good answer for you. This feels really counterintuitive. I think this is a testament to just
how bored we are. Feels like we're wasting
a lot of water and energy. Mack, what are you doing? Dude, there are so many fish down there. - Really?
- Yeah. There's a stingray, look at all those fish. Those waves
look really big over there. And they're coming right at us. Here comes a big one. Almost there. Look at the island over there
in the background, And here we are. Look at this. We've got water splashing on both sides. These are extra slippery rocks. We are going up now? Oh gosh. Oh, this is crazy. This looks so cool. We did it. I don't know why we did it,
but we did. How do we get off this? And then how do we get back
to our island? Well, the fastest way off is jumping. I'm not jumping. During our last
few hours of sunlight. I felt a couple raindrops. We noticed the storm
approaching us on the horizon. We got on the island. The forecast said
it wasn't supposed to rain. There's monster clouds over there. We need to prep. Let's go boys. Nolan, fix it! Fix the hut. - Oh, no.
- There's rain coming. Protect our stuff. Get as many palm leaves
as you can right now. Chandler, more leaves. And once we ran out of daylight, we huddled up under our new
and improved shelter and awaited a night of rain. The worst part about
this is the unknown. It's so dark. You can't even see how close
the rain is anymore. Turns out we got extremely lucky. The storm ended up
just missing us by a hair. But what I can say is, later in this
video, we won't be so lucky. What do we do, it's raining? Dude, it's literally pouring,
help me hold this up. I just want to go home. Good morning, everybody. Let me try that again. Good morning, everybody. - Good morning.
- Good morning. You guys got a case of the Mondays? After four days on the island, our morning routine
consisted of the following. First, we'd wake up and complain
about how bad we slept. Sleeping last night was rough. And then we'd use the bathroom,
sometimes together. I'm nervous peeing at the same time
as you guys. And then eat yet again, a bagged meal. We're a little tired of our bag
meals, so let's just say we've got a solution. All right,
This is as far as I go. Have fun. - Oh, good.
- All this for some fish? You have to go very,
very far out to actually find fish. The fish aren't going to be in this,
like, blue water. They're going to be in the dark
blue water out there. So... This will be a really good idea,
or a really bad one. Probably a bad one. The plan was a little dangerous,
but simple, Mack is going to act as a human motorboat and drag Shawn and Nolan
out into the depths of the ocean. And Shawn being the expert survival
dad that he is. is going to catch those fish and bring them back to shore for us to eat. You guys got the rope? I also brought around 500 feet
of rope that they're tied to. So if at any point they need help,
we'll just yank them in. Right Chandler? Yeah. Is the rope still good? Yeah, you have plenty of rope. Mack, you doing okay? Is Mack literally just pulling them? We should just untie the rope Mack, because that's some dead weight. Hope you don't regret it. Now we have no rope,
and we're so far away from the beach. There's no way they're not getting
seasick out there. Oh, look at that storm. - Is that a storm?
- Boys, we better hurry. - That's rain?
- That's rain. Something tells me
this rope snapped somewhere. Oh, no. You know what we can do? We can start fishing. I wouldn't start fishing yet,
he's in the water. - Guys!
- Your rope came off. - You see any fish down there?
- I don't see anything. None yet. We have the rope. - Oh, you got something?
- Yeah. Yeah. - We got a fish.
- Hold on, hold on to it. - Yeah.
- We got him. - Fish!
- Yeah! Fish! And after 2 hours of fishing and
200 fishes worth of calories burned, all they had
to show for it was one fish. Is this fine to eat? Yeah, of course. It literally tastes like fish
from the supermarket. I mean, you know where fish
in the supermarket come from, right? - Where?
- The ocean. And even though this fish from
the ocean was surprisingly good, it was time to eat something
a whole lot better. S'mores. S'mores. First off, you need to burn
the bacteria off your stick. Oh, I didn't know that, actually. You seem like you've done s'mores before,
Jim. Well, as a man who owns
a chocolate company. Oh, Mack.
What are you doing? Oh, God. You take the Feastables chocolate,
scrunch it like that while it's still hot, Look at that. Make sure to try out
our new Feastables bar. People are actually liking it
so much. It's sold out in most stores. Don't worry. We're doing our best
to restock it as fast as we can. You've never had a s'more
in your life until you've had a s'more
with Feastables on it. Like clockwork, we lay down
and go to bed and it starts raining. Why is it that whenever we do
survival videos, it literally only rains
when we're trying to sleep? I'd say
that was a very successful day for. - Yeah.
- I agree. You caught a chicken. I caught a fish. Here's
the three more days of stupidity. Yeah. I just woke up, I have no idea what day it is. It's day... Five. I was about to say that. One of the reasons
why we picked this island is there's very old houses or ruins, whatever
you want to call it, on this island. And even though they're located
on top of a mountain, I say today's the day
we explore them. - I agree.
- Disagree. Now that we had all agree to go to the ruins,
we want to make sure we didn't start this expedition
on an empty stomach. And just as we were eating our bagged breakfast,
no one noticed something more appetizing down the beach. Over there on the shoreline. - What is it?
- There's a goat. No way, bro. There's a goat. - Mack, you cannot eat that.
- You can't stop me. No. - Run away goat.
- Jimmy! Run away, goat. Get out of here. Yes. - Why would you do that?
- He's our friend. No, he's not is food. Once again,
Jimmy scared away my food. And after sparing
another animal from Mack, it was time to adventure
to the ruins. All right, let's do it. - We're almost out of water, guys.
- I need some for the adventure. I'm gonna trying to fill these up
with coconut water while you're gone. - Let's go.
- Let's do it. Yeah. Keep going.
I'll be there in one second. And what they don't know is
I actually have a surprise waiting for us
at the top of the ruins. It'll make sense in a little bit. That was kind of weird, how you just stayed back
and talked to the camera. Yeah, kind of like how you lost $1.5
million. Oh, yeah. Follow me, gang. Jimmy, I believe in you. For a second, I thought
this was the mountain. Forgot, we haven't even reached
the base of the mountain yet. And while we climb this mountain, I'm
going to tell the boys about Western Union. Wherever you are, Western Union
makes it easy to send money to friends and family anywhere
in the world. We'll be up here. Yeah, you keep talking about that Jim. Hey, wait up for me. We'll go all the way up there? Western Union also has a free website
and app that's simple and secure. So even my Grandma can use it? Even your Grandma, Mack. And before I got here
I used Western Union to pay the boat... You got to be careful. Here, give me a second Western Union. I also use Western Union to pay the boat guy that dropped me off
on this island. Because they had been
around for a 100 years. I know my money got to them
even though I was in the U.S.. Look how far away
we've come from our beach. Dude, is that a rainbow? Rainbow right there? - Oh yeah.
- What the heck? That's awesome. I'm not going to be like a Debbie
Downer, but that's rain right there. That giant cloud? That giant cloud with the rain coming up. You're being a Debbie Downer. Hey, you can see Shawn from here. Dude, he's building the shelter. Shawn's making us dinner. Shawn! I can see you. He heard us. Keep going. Wave if you're a nerd. Oh, he's waving. Is it going to be dark when
we go back on this path? Yeah. - How are we going to see?
- Oh, we'll figure that out later. That's going to be unfortunate
if somebody falls. - Are you good?
- You good? I'm alive. See that right over there?
Boys, come on. Come on over here. Welcome to the ruins. This is actually sick. Dude, why is there just a yellow box? Yeah, what is this thing? I'm glad you asked. I paid some guys with Western Union
$10,000 to move this box up here. Really? Nolan, there's a crowbar in your backpack. - What do you think's in here?
- Pizza? You knew that
we were going to run out of water, so you put extra water in this box. And while we're opening this. There's never been a better time to download
or sign up for Western Union. Your first transaction is free. Just go to westernunion.com/mrbeast. I know I could have filled this crate
with extra water and food, but instead I brought something
even better. Mack, does this moment
remind you of something?  Hold this picture of you losing 800 grand.  Now here's a picture of you
losing 700 grand. Bro, why? - Why go through all…
- You'll see it, one second, don't worry. Now, I didn't do this to make
fun of Mack for losing $1.5 million. Really? Because that's exactly
what it feels like you're doing. I did this to say, that we're going to give you
another chance in one final video. - No shot.
- But this is your final shot. You're going to give me a third shot. - Your final shot.
- I got another shot. If you look at the last video we did, every single comment was
bring back Mack, bring back Mack. I hope you win. - That's another shot.
- More important than your shot. There's some ruins over here. Look at them. Third shot baby. I'm not going
to let you guys down again. This building is almost
a century old. Imagine building this 100 years ago
just for a bunch of YouTubers to explore it. This is wicked. Why is there a cactus up there? Does the cactus just crawl up there? or does someone put the cactus up there? The cactus does not crawl up there, Jimmy. It doesn't have legs. Oh, my God. Let's check out
on the other side of the crate. - There's some more ruins over there.
- This is crazy. Look how the tree is like wrap
around the freaking rocks. Would the gang say
this was worth the effort? Because I got a third chance,
yes I would. All right, well he's biased. Would you two say it was worth it? - No.
- There was no pizza in the box, so no. By this time day five sun
was setting on the island. And on our way back to camp,
we stopped at the peak of the mountain
to take it all in. There's no one. I'd rather scaled the side
of a random mountain with than you guys. Thank you. Maybe Dwayne, the Rock, Johnson. That's fair. But outside of that,
nobody. Boys, I'm going to be honest, - I'm going to remember this forever.
- Me too. I think this view made the journey
worth it. Camp's cleaned up. It's been reinforced from the rain,
coconut water, meals ready to go. Got a lot more water.
It's getting really dark. I mean, you can't even see
into the woods right now. I don't know how they're going to make it
back from the top of that mountain to all these woods in the dark. This is way sketchier at night Cactus. - You good?
- Just a thorn on my side. But little did we know running into a cactus
in the middle of the night was actually
the least of our worries. We ended up hitting a dead end, which is a little intimidating
in the middle of a forest. Which direction is it? Is it this way or
that way? Wait, I can see three different things. Dude, there's this right here And then there's this one right here. This is a path too. Are you sure? - Or is that it?
- It's definitely not to... Follow me. Guys, I will pick a random direction. Wait. No, no. I think it is to the left. - Oh, it is?
- No, it's right over here. Oh, it's raining. And we must have been extra
lucky that night because on top of being lost,
it started raining. Are you sure this is the right one? Jimmy, it's this way. - Which way are we...?
- I told you we should go left. - Wait, Chandler!
- Follow me! Chandler, how sure are you? - I'm 10% sure it's this way.
- So wouldn't 90% be better? Are you 90%? Can we choose? It's pouring on the side
of a mountain. Go. It's raining. Okay. Why do we choose it then unchoose? Oh, boys, this is bad. It is getting slick. I really don't think we came up
something this steep. I almost face planted. And if we couldn't be any more
unlucky on top of it raining while we're lost, We've even got a third thing
to worry about. Above you
is the most dangerous tree on earth. If it rains, it will seep poison
that will burn your skin. Watch out for the death apple sap
because it just rained. - What are we supposed to do?
- Not let the poison drip on you? Oh, that is 10,000%
of death apple tree boys That means we're close. And regardless of
if we took the right path or not, we could tell
we were getting close to camp. - That's sand.
- That's some sand. - Thank God.
- We made it? Camp is right there. We have a rare opportunity to scare
Shawn. Are we going to take advantage
of that? - Yes.
- Of course. Okay. Oh, God. Oh, my God. You scared me. - We made it.
- Yeah, we're back. I made you guys
dinner and coconut water. Oh, I appreciate it. Cheers, boys. Wow, it tastes like a coconut. After the hike, we ate, we showers,
and when we dried off, we took a second
to look up at the stars. Because when you're
in the middle of the ocean, it really feels like
you're on another planet. But unexpectedly, around the corner was something we've been fearing
this entire challenge. You feel that? Guys, bad news. There's a ton of water
on the top of our shelter. I just don't know if that's going
to be safe for us to be under it. Despite our efforts from earlier
to make the shelter better, water was beginning to pool up
on our roof from the storm. All this water on top of us, is there a world that
could bring our structure down? And even though all we wanted at
this point was a night of sleep, we had to get up and deal with it. Oh, my God, we're absolutely screwed. I'm just getting destroyed
and pummeled by rain all night. And after 2 hours of rain,
a damage shelter and soaking wet beds there is no chance any of us
we're going to sleep that night. Raining on you at night, the worst experience
you can have on these challenges. I'm so tired. Hopefully it just passes over. And even though this was an all time low,
our only option was to wait this thing out. I'm not going to lie. The rain
last night was pretty brutal. I don't know that I've ever been
that cold ever. What do you want
to do today, Nolan? I don't know. Absolutely nothing. I just can't wait to get out of here. This place sucks a lot. I'm not going to lie. I'm sick and I'm tired, and I want to go
home. at this point, the island was
making us miserable. This is quickly turning
into a little bit of a nightmare. And after six days
of physical struggle, our mental health
was beginning to suffer as well. There's only so much bagged food you can drink and
hours you can lay in the sun before
you start to just feel terrible. And I'm starting to feel terrible. I have a headache.
I am very tired. It was clear that we were going
to have to take drastic measures if we were going to complete
this challenge. Looking for a peach cobbler. Wanna look for a peach cobbler? Oh, I found one. So, in an effort to turn things around, we treated ourselves
to canned cobbler for breakfast. Pretty good. How about it? For a can And with the help of this unorthodox
breakfast. Chandler happy. We were beginning to return back
to normal. Nolan. Dude, you hit straight into the tree. And it became clear how exactly
we were going to survive day six. By having fun with each other. And I began to realize... even though we've all done
a lot of suffering. Why'd we pick the heaviest seat
in existence? This whole trip has been filled
with a lot of fun. Cheers boys. And adventure. We did it. Moments like these are hard to find. And when I look back
on this challenge, we probably won't remember
the bad times as much as we will the good. It's kind of cool. And with day six of our challenge
finally coming to an end. We're celebrating our final
night with a massive fire but it's kind of burning us all. - Yeah, I'm getting back.
- It's a little too big. When we wake up tomorrow,
the challenge will be over. And as the sun rose on day
seven. Go, get me out of here. We broke down camp
and cleaned up with one thing in mind. Leaving this place
and never coming back. And before we leave,
I just want to take the time to say thank you all for watching. All of you are the only reason videos
like this exist, and I really hope you all enjoyed it."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKdjycj-7eE,"Stop This Train, Win a Lamborghini",1140,20240316,en,"- Sitting on these train tracks is a quarter million dollar Lamborghini. And barreling down at it right now is a massive train. But before the impact, I'm
giving this Lamborghini to Blake. - Thank you. - And on top of sending the train, I'm also gonna have these eight soldiers shoot 10,000 bullets at your Lamborghini. - That's the scariest
thing I've ever seen. - Yeah, it's gonna be fun. - And you have exactly 24 hours
to build whatever you want to protect your Lambo from the bullets. The timer starts now. - Okay, first line of defense, I'm thinking a wall of
cinder blocks, after that some shipping containers
filled with refrigerators and then basically just a wall of cars to block those bullets. - Do you think
all of this is enough to stop 10,000 bullets? - I think it is, Jimmy. - Okay, but so
far nothing's there. You should get to building. - So Blake immediately
drove to three stores where I gave him my credit card and he literally spent
$78,000 on supplies. And since I don't wanna bore
you with all that, let's skip to the part where
everything was delivered. This first round of supplies
are starting to show up. - Oh my God, I can't believe
I bought all this stuff. And this isn't even everything, man. - He's got a water truck. Some of his junk cars came in. He's got a CONEX crate over here. How did he get this much
stuff? This is crazy. Don't worry about the guys
with the machine guns. Just pretend they're not there. Yeah, I don't even know what they're doing there, honestly. - We're five hours in and
this storage container is about to be the first line of defense against 10,000 bullets. - Alright, that's probably
good. That's probably good. Do you think that shipping container's gonna stop any bullets? - Absolutely not. - So as of now, he's screwed. - Yeah, it's not looking good for him. - Oh gosh. It's been about six hours. Are
you happy with your progress? - I'm very happy.
- You sure? - It wasn't until this thing got down, but now that it's down,
dude, I feel really good. - I asked him if this
would stop the bullets and they said no. And once Blake realized
he had to go all out, he works not only through the night This way, Mr. Railroad ties. - Nice, nice. Yes. - Really nice. Really nice. - But even into the next morning, upgrading his defense- - Dude, he's stuffing the
storage container with a van and a giant tube! - And once I saw it put together, I was honestly pretty impressed. Run me through what you built. - So I built a whole
bunch of concrete in the front and the tallest part of the
wall is right in the center to block the crow's nest machine guns 'cause those things are big and scary. - I got all my cars in storage containers and a bunch of water. - And if you come right over here, you'll see his Lamborghini
tucked away amongst everything. - There it is. Nice and cozy. - Do you think all of
this will stop the bullets? - Yeah, I do. I think you have a 50% chance of survival. - That's the best odds I've had yet. - And before I have
them shoot 10,000 rounds, come with me to the Lamborghini. Not only are you competing
for this Lamborghini, but for a hundred grand as well. - What?
- Yes sir. - Yeah, that's pretty cool, huh? - This will be enough to cover
the insurance. 24 hours is up! Eight scary men, 10,000 bullets- - Versus everything
that Blake has built... - Are you ready? - Just get it over with. I'm freaking out. - We're locked and loaded.
Ready to fire on you, Jimmy. - Sir, fire at will.
- Roger that. - Standby! Fire! - Oh!
- Oh my god! - They are unloading on his fortress. - Oh my God! This is crazy! - They're actually ripping through the cinder blocks now. - Oh man. Oh god. - Oh, Blake's walls
are crumbling right now! And what we haven't told
Blake is these guns are only the first of four phases we've designed to destroy this Lamborghini, or should I say whatever
remains after this? - They just brought up the LMG. - Oh, whoa! - Oh, it's melting! - No! Cinder blocks are falling! - Ah! - All it takes is
one bullet to penetrate and it's going in his Lambo. - Oh my God! - These are the last bullets. - Ten thousand! - All clear? Let's go. Please be safe. Please be safe. How is it?! - She's clean, baby! - Whoo! 10,000 rounds and
not one connection baby. - There's no bullet holes
in your Lamborghini. And if you don't already
know who Blake is, he's actually a contestant
from our previous two videos. But today he's back for a third and final attempt to win the grand prize. - Are you ready for phase two? - Yes. - See that giant crane coming? - That big yellow oil rig looking thing? - That is phase two. That crane is going to lift
your car up a hundred feet and then in 24 hours drop it. And you have to catch it
without it being destroyed. - Seriously? - Yeah. Alright, bring it over here! And while we prepared the
world's first 100 foot Lamborghini free fall... - There goes your Lamborghini, Blake! Blake began to strategize on
how he was going to catch it. - I have no idea what I'm gonna do. - Chandler, come over here. - Yes, I'm here. - How would you break its fall? - So you get all the pillows in the city. Step two, get all the
mattresses, next, get a blanket. - Chandler, you're just
making a giant bed. - Then a warm glass of milk... - All right, stop. You're not helping. Blake, work your magic. - I'm screwed. - Alright guys, I got some
good news and bad news. We passed day one with flying colors. The bad news is the
Lamborghini is airborne. Okay? So anyone got any ideas? I mean, yeah, hit me,
like what do we think? - The bouncy castles.
- Bouncy castles. That that's actually not that bad. Just because...that's
not bad at all really. - And after being inspired by the construction worker's wisdom, Blake had decided on his master plan. - I would like to move the
CONEXes in like a square, right here with the X in the middle. And that way I can just fill
the square up with a bunch of air mattresses, pillows, bubble wrap, and on top it all off with
a bunch of bouncy castles. Just the biggest problem right
now is I have no material. Everything that I bought
is hard, concrete or metal. And nothing that I bought
I can use for day two. So, I have absolutely nothing. - And so Blake sent his
crew to buy every pillow and air mattress in the city. And even though he was
incredibly sleep deprived, he got to work. - I'm already at the stage
where it's like, ""Wait, why am I doing this again?"" Oh yeah, that's right. I'm in
a challenge for a Lamborghini that's floating in the sky right now. - By the time his
materials had arrived, Blake had been awake for over 24 hours and was in desperate need of sleep. - I'm gonna try to get some sleep 'cause I'm exhausted and
it's four in the morning. - And with how exhausted Blake was, he ended up sleeping for
way longer than he planned. Blake! Is he serious? - What is this? He got mattresses, pillows, and blankets. But he's missing the warm milk. - Yeah, that's the key to everything. - Where is Blake? - He's asleep. I heard. - No, he is not. - By the time Blake got on site, it was already super late in the day. - That's Blake's truck pulling up. Alright, we need to get to work. Come on! - Alright, let's just
see what this looks like. Oh, that bouncy house works as a big box. So I'm thinking maybe we put
that thing in the middle now and then we start blowing it up. - Only four and a half hours remain and it's not looking good for Blake. I don't think he has
more than a 10% chance of catching a Lamborghini. - And even if he does,
there's no shot he's stopping that train later on. - Start filling up the side so
that way it's high over here, takes away this wall. - So with only a
couple of hours remaining, Blake did all that he could
by filling the rest of his pit with cardboard boxes and bubble wrap. - It's coming down to the wire. Chandler, how much time is left? - One hour. - Blake is screwed. - I have a little bit of bubble wrap left. I think I'm just gonna
get raised on this thing and just wrap my baby
up in this bubble wrap and I'm good to go. - That's definitely gonna help. - Blake spent what little
time he had remaining on this crane, failing at
trying to bubble wrap his car. - It's just not gonna work. - You know what time it is? - What? - Time to drop the car.
Let's drop this by boy. The failed bubble wrap
makes it look majestic. Blake, do you think your
Lamborghini will survive? - I'm positive, Jimmy. - He is more certain than me. - I'm positive about this one. I bought every air mattress at Walmart. If this won't catch it,
I don't know what will. I did everything I can. - Here's a Feastables bar, Blake. - Ah, thank you Mr. - That way even if you lose the car, at least you have some good chocolate. It's available at Walmart. Be
sure to go try our new bar. I'm so curious what you think. But anyway, you have three
bouncy castles, 150 mattresses, how many pillows?
- 150. - 150 pillows and 2,000 cardboard boxes! Will it break the Lamborghini's fall? - Yes. Yes. - That's two yeses.
- Okay. - 24 hours of work, down
to this, no pun intended. - 3, 2, 1. Drop the Lamborghini! Here we go! Outta my way! - That did not sound good. - Please be okay.
Please be okay. Please be okay. Please be okay. - Alright. He's moving the
CONEX crate out the way. - There's no way you caught that Lambo. - Get these boxes outta the way! - Whoa!
- What? - We're about to find out
how damaged this car is. - The lights work. - Ooh, the lights work. - Yeah. This princess castle might have saved this entire car. - Moment of truth. You might've been the
first person in history to catch a Lamborghini- - If it turns on. - Alright, here we go. Here we
go. Here we go. Whoa, it works! I can't believe it! Yay! That's what I'm talking
about! She's alive! - Everything looks good, minus
a little crack in the bumper, which we found out via official appraiser. This was only going to reduce the price of Blake's Lamborghini by... - Probably 10 grand. - Thank you so much.
Thanks for the good news. - Right now's the perfect time
to mention that Phase three is flaming cars. - For Blake's next challenge we're bringing back his biggest nightmare. We have recreated the
flaming cars challenge that costed Blake everything last time. - Wow, that's a low blow. - But seeing that
she's done this before, we're gonna up the
stakes by dropping twice as many cars as last time. - I'll see you tomorrow.
- I got a lot to prove. Redemption day! - Blake spent the rest
of the night disassembling his defense for phase two. And after a good night
of sleep, he was ready to begin his defense for phase three. - It's eight in the morning. Just woke up. We got a
lot of work to do today. So let's get started. - Here's the day three plan. I'm gonna cut the bottom
out of a shipping container. I'm gonna drop it right on the car. Next I'm gonna take two more containers and I'm gonna lead them up coming to a point right above the car. - And most importantly,
nothing flammable this time. - Do you think that will deflect a car? - Yes sir. - Oh, I thought you were
gonna say no. Blake then asked his crew to
remove every piece of wood that was in the container because that's what ended
his challenge last time. He then had them cut out
the bottom of the container that would surround the Lamborghini. - The storage container
could put a lot of damage. - Completely crush it?
- Yeah. - It can? - I mean, yeah, that
thing weighs a whole lot. - And with that
being done, Blake just needs to lower the container
carefully over the Lamborghini without damaging it. - One scratch can
cost some thousands of dollars. You're good just like that? - It is so close
to scraping the car. - Watch your fingers.
We're coming down! - Yes! Yes! - I cannot believe that! - Next we're gonna
bring these containers together to form a ""V"". - What if the car gets caught in there? - Yeah, that's, that can't happen, dude. That's why we're putting
this pointy thing at the top. - Do you think that will
actually deflect our car? - A hundred percent. - 20 minutes remain and then
we see if that Lamborghini perishes just like his 500 grand. And as usual, Blake
utilized every last second. 3, 2, 1. Not quite sure what
that dirt accomplished. Time is up.
- No! - Let's see if unlike last
time, you survive phase three. - Redemption! - Blake, you lost $500,000 from
this exact challenge. How are you feeling? - I feel pretty confident. - I think the viewers
wanna know one thing: Did you put wood inside
of there like last time? - A little bit. No, I'm just kidding.
There's no wood in there. It was one of the biggest mistakes I've ever made in my life. - Moment of truth. Come on in. Three shipping containers. A bunch of dirt, concrete, a weird like, pointed roof thing. Versus 10 flaming cars! Are you ready? - Let's go dude. - Light it on fire! - Will Blake be
one step closer to going home with the new Lamborghini filled with a hundred thousand
dollars or be eliminated and go home with nothing? - We're about to find out. 3, 2, 1. Drop it! - Oh! - Oh, oh! - Oh. You did not want that. - I feel like that's exactly
what he didn't want to happen. Oh no. Still feeling good? - Not as good. - Yeah, this is giving me some flashbacks. - It's giving you some flashbacks. - Alright, ready for the next one? - Let's do it. Let's do it. - Drop it. - Oh my God, the roof looks
like it's already buckling. - And just in case Blake
loses the flaming cars like last time, I'm gonna take this moment and tell you about this amazing new phone. What you're currently watching on is the new Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra. This phone can record slow-mo in 4K. The camera on this is crazy. We're like 200 feet
away and it's nighttime. And look at that; crystal clear. - Ho ho ho ho!
- And go ahead and drop it. - Oh! - Oh, that hurt to watch. It also has a ton of new features with Galaxy AI, like Photo Assist. - Remember the last
challenge when the bumper got cracked on the Lambo? You can just circle it like this and then all you do is you
hit that eraser button. And just like that, the bumper is fixed. - Now I have a new car. - For the picture you do - Whenever you're ready. This phone also has
circle to search Google, which makes finding
information incredibly easy. It would've helped Blake
a lot in the last video to learn about the flammability
of wooden railroad ties. All he needed to do was
long press the home button, highlight the railroad ties and
ask, ""Is this flammable?"" - As you can see, railroad
ties are flammable. - You would've learned
the answer instantly. Could have just told you. I was genuinely impressed by this phone and I think you will be too. So go to samsung.com, click
the link in the description or scan this QR code to
check it out right now and let's drop the next car. - We dropped car after car, and with each one we could tell Blake was getting more nervous,
but we also noticed that all of the impacts were starting to damage the crate itself. - Your crate on the bottom is bowing. - At this point,
the container protecting the Lambo was being crushed by the weight and heat of the cars. - I thought about this every day since the last time I saw this. - And now it's
time for the final car! - Yes! - Oh no! - Bro, it's gotta be
a thousand degrees in there! This car's probably melting right now. - We got the fire extinguisher. - Somehow he's running so
fast. Be careful, Blake. - I'm coming. - How is it? - It's okay. It's okay! Yes! You like that? - If one more car was dropped, this crate would've collapsed. You stopped 10,000 bullets.
- Easy. - You caught a car out of mid air. You've now deflected ten flaming cars. - Now its time for phase four. - Bring on the train. - The timer has officially started. - I gotta go. - Good luck on phase four. - God speed. - What is he even running at? In case you're wondering,
the flaming cars we dropped and a lot of other stuff we used
were actually from a scrapyard. And don't worry, we made sure
to clean up everything afterwards. - Blake knew that the train was going to be the most deadly attack yet, so he wasted no time in getting started. - I think the best way to
stop a train is to derail it. That's what I've tried to build here. All these railroad ties are tucked snug, and all of these are
gonna go under the train. The train's gonna hit 'em like that. And if I do that a hundred more times, I don't see the train just
blowing past all that. The railroad ties lost me
the challenge last video. This time they'll save me. I just need two inches
off the track and I win. - Two inches is a lot though. - My man. And then once I have all this done, I can just put concrete on top. I think that's gonna work,
man. I think that's gonna work. - Blake worked
with his crew throughout the entire night and when I
showed up the next morning, it was obvious that this
challenge had taken a toll on him. What's up, Jimbo? - What happened to your voice? - I'm like dying out here. - As you guys know, he lost
$250,000 in this video. He lost half a million
dollars in this video. I think Blake is sick and tired of losing. He has an army going super hard. They're currently stacking the cars that we dropped on phase
three on the train tracks. But time was still ticking down. And in order to stop this
train and take his Lambo home, Blake began adding a lot more objects to the tracks, like shipping
containers, mattresses to cushion the impact... - Blake's worked so hard.
I'm now on his team. - And water tanks. - Blake really seems to
know what he's doing. Too bad, there's only 11 minutes left. At this point, Blake
did everything he could to finish his build before time ran out, and it was actually
starting to look impressive. - This is it.
- Three... - The final stretch, - Two, one.
- Last line of defense. - Time's up. Stop. Turn it off. Turn it off. Time is officially up! - Oh my God. - From phase one
shipping containers, phase two's mattresses, and even phase
three's burning cars. Blake, you somehow used all the resources from the previous phases. - Let's see if you're
driving home in a Lamborghini or if I'm dropping you off at your house. - Bring that train on, man. Bring it on. - Before we ram everything,
we need to back the train up. We're gonna go really far back. That way the train can
pick up a lot of speed before it hits everything.
Sounds like a good idea? - No, that sounds awful. - Be honest, Blake. Do you think your Lamborghini will survive? - God, I hope so, Jimmy. - And of course we had to
put the Feastables logo on the train. It's the best chocolate on earth. Do yourself a favor and
try the new formula, but for now, it's time
for the biggest moment of Blake's life. Let's see if he wins a Lamborghini. Blake, any last words? - Give it all you got. - Send the train. Here it comes. - Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. - It's coming! - It's gonna speed up
until it hits 35 miles an hour right before impact. - Dude, it is going quick! - It's just gonna
derail. It's just gonna derail. - Here she comes! Let's see if it was all worth it! - Oh, wait, wait, wait! - Blake, it derailed!
- Wait, I think it stopped! - Oh my God! - Blake, I've never
seen someone this happy! - Oh wow, you derailed it! - Oh my God. Oh my God. I did it! Oh! Oh my God! - This is your new Lamborghini, Blake! Not only did he win the Lamborghini, but he also got all this money! - Yes! - Congrats. - I did it! - You wanna know the best
way to end this video, Blake? - What? - By them going to Walmart and
buying Feastables right now. It's the best tasty
chocolate on the planet. Third time's the charm.
See you guys later! - Yes!"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWYsfOSY9vY,I Survived 7 Days In An Abandoned City,1043,20240302,en,"We just got dropped off
in the middle of an abandoned city. And we're going to spend the next
seven days here. And there goes our only way out. We're now stranded
for the next seven days. Why are we doing this? For content. This once beautiful city
was bombed an abandoned because of war, which means the only people here
are us and our cameraman. At least that we know of. So I guess we start off
by getting off the roof. We knew that our first objective
was to explore this city and find a safe place to call home
for the next seven days, which starts
with exploring this building All right, let's see what's down
the bottom of this building. I assume under this wood is a floor. Only one way to find out. All right, this is crazy. I feel like I'm
in a zombie apocalypse. This is wild. Oh, look at this. After a little more exploring, we stumbled upon an area
that might work for our shelter. Oh, my Gosh. I think this is where
we should set up camp. You can see the entire city
over here. Plus, we have a
roof to protect us from rain. And now that we
had our home base decided, the next step was to open up the supplies crate left
by the helicopter on the roof. Let's pop open this crate
so we can build camp. We need some gear. This crate contains
all of the survival gear we'll need for the next seven days. And so we don't have to carry stuff
all the way down the stairs. We're just going to drop it. Chandler. We have a perfect assembly line. Kris, it's raining
sleeping bags. Chandler, there's our dinner plates. Wait, Chandler don't let it fall. Chandler. Yeah! That was the coolest thing we've ever done. But jokes aside, it was time
to actually start surviving now. Who wants fire
duty? - We'll get it.
- We're on bed duty. Kris got started on making a fire
with Mark. I'm personally a fan of the log
cabin when it comes to fires. Eagle Scout.
Did I mention that yet? While Chandler and I look
for something for us to sleep on. This is what mattresses
were like a hundred years ago? Wait, you found a mattress? - Yeah.
- Where? On the second floor
in a corner. - That's all you.
- Thanks. You should wrap
that thing in a tarp so you don't get destroyed by bugs. I'm going to wrap
that mattress like a burrito. And while Chandler took us chances
with a sketchy mattress, The rest of us decided
to sleep on wooden doors. There's no shot that you're
more comfortable than me right now. My back already hurts. There are so many buildings
we have yet to explore in the city. Tomorrow's going to be insane. We'll see you in the morning. Even though our first day in
the city went pretty smooth. Something eerie did happen to occur
later that night. While we were sleeping, Mark and some of the camera guys woke up to the sound
of breaking glass not far from the camp. Which made us start to wonder if we were really alone
inside the city. What was it? We just heard glass shattering there. I thought I saw something. But on top of the freaky noises, this first shelter was way
too windy to sleep. How'd you guys sleep? Bad. So in pursuit of better sleep,
we got up, got breakfast and prepare to find our new shelter. This is the first time
I've had chili for breakfast. But I'm so hungry,
I kind of don't care. Well, since the raft. When have I ever been
this excited over canned chili? I think my brain tried
to forget about that. Thanks. So after a nutritious breakfast,
we took off our drone to seek out a new shelter
in the unexplored buildings. We haven't explored that building. We haven't explored those hotels. It is an actual city here. However, upon
scanning the buildings, we did stumble upon
an unexpected guest. - There's a cat.
- There's a cat down there. I'm going to land the drone
right beside the cat. Look at that shot. Kris, Kris, look,
it's sniffing the camera. This cat has no survival instinct. I promise we are not paying
this cat to be an actor. As fun as playing with these cats
is, we need to focus on shelter because it's
going to be freezing tonight. And so we started our journey to find a sufficient shelter
for the challenge. Wait, what is this? This is pretty. It just has this type of
like aesthetic to it, that is like beautiful
even though it's ugly. Zombie apocalypse aesthetic. Yeah. There you go. Wait, is that a pool? What the heck? This is so eerie. Back in the day,
this used to look something like this. And after decades of rotting from being abandoned,
this is what we're left with. Wait, there's a soccer field? The sports court. Is that a soccer ball? I almost died. I bet this soccer ball
is older than me. Older than all of us, for sure. Well, besides, Mark,
he's old. We have two options now. We can keep exploring
down this cool looking tunnel and go check
out the neighborhood. Or with the hour of light we have left, we can prep for nighttime
and not freeze all night. - Not freeze.
- That sounds like a good idea. I agree. And after spending the entire day
looking for a new shelter, I just can't get over
how massive the city is. We finally found a place
fortified enough to call home. So we don't freeze tonight. We're thinking of setting up camp
in this room right here. We'll have a fire pit right here. We can tarp the wall right there.
It's going to be comfy. Yeah, Mark's
going to do all that. I said we. The only hard part is,
come over here. Our current camp and all our gear
is all the way over there. I hope this place really works out because it's going to be
a lot of effort to set up. With the sun getting low and
the temperature rapidly dropping. We made our way back
to the old camping spot and packed up
to settle into the new base. We're headed into the new campsite. The new camp, the new camp. The new camp. Okay, we've got a lot of cleanup
to do to prep this for tonight. This looks like a terrible place,
but whatever. After finding
a more weatherproof base, we spent the next few hours dragging
in as many of our belongings as we could before sundown. Now, because it got dark so fast, we couldn't bring all of
our resources to the new base. So aside from one water bag, cans of chili and a couple of old
mattresses, this is all we had. What does everyone
think of our new place? I like that there's no wind. And it's much warmer. Chandler? What? It was now the third day
of seven doing this challenge. And once we got up,
we continued exploring. Be careful. These stairs actually steep. On this whole staircase, three of the stairs are normal. This beach is nice. It actually smells like a beach. It's because it is a beach. But not too far in,
something strange happened. I think I see someone. What? Don't you see that reflecting thing
over there under the stairs? Oh, I do. Jimmy, remember how we almost died the first night from glass
bottle attack? I wonder if that's
where the glass bottles came from. It was at this moment
when we realized we actually weren't alone
in this abandoned city after all. And once our cameraman spotted
this mysterious person on our drone, we did what anyone would do. Let's go check it out. Investigation. That building is sick. Why is this mansion beside
this giant motel? Decades ago, this hotel stood
as a first class vacation resort. But years of war
turn this once picturesque property into a city of ruins. Let's head on in. What did we just get ourselves into? We totally don't
wait for the cameraman to walk in the room before we go in. Anyways. It's getting dark. Everyone, stop. Stop. Candy. We should go in there. I'll go first. Go ahead.
Thank you. You think it's a Feastables bar? What the heck? This is starting to get very eerie,
and I think Mark should go first. What? Look at how deep this hallway is. Also, if you fall over here,
you might die. There's a very non-zero chance
somebody could be in here. and like attack us. If someone attacked us.
What are we doing? Every man for himself. Yeah, whoever's the slowest just dies. What's that light? Hello. I'm creeped out now, guys. We spent the rest of the day
searching for the lurk, but once it started getting dark, we can only hope that later
he wouldn't be looking for us. And now that it's dark out, here's what
we've actually been waiting for. Give me Big Bertha. Thank you. Big Bertha. Notice how you can't
see that building over there. This is the world's
most powerful flashlight. Now you can. Bro, I bet the fish
in the ocean are tripping. It stopped working. How the mighty have fallen. The pluses of our actions
is we got to play with the world's strongest flashlight at night. The negatives of our actions is that
we got to walk back in the dark. That was bad timing. It's way scarier going
through this place at night. Yeah, a thousand percent. It really
feels like the world is ending and we're just like surviving. So to avoid being murdered in cold blood, we return back the camp. We're back at camp. Yeah. I'll get a fire going. I'm hungry. There's literally only chili left. And so with the last of our supply
here, we're feasting. Tomorrow, if we got
some tables and seven chairs. - And more food.
- That'd be awesome. But when we woke up on the morning
of day four out of seven, we realized that we were already
running low on supplies. Our bag of water is out of water. Do we have more? Point the camera at that roof,
all the way over there. I wish I had more than a hundred
calories in my body to go get it. Nose goes. What does nose goes mean? It sounds like you're going. He's going to need help.
He can't carry it on his own. So Mark and Chandler
set out to go all the way back to ground Zero
to get more supplies from the crate. Chandler and I,
we're on a side quest for water. This is a main quest. While they get the water, we don't want to be useless. We? I'm fine. I don't want us to be useless. So we're going to go
try to find a table and some chairs. But we didn't get very far before
Kris got distracted, Did we not know this was here? Jimmy? - Yeah?
- I found a bike. That looks like a nice bike. - Where'd you find that?
- In here. This is the coolest abandoned city ever. - Having fun?
- I am. All right, I'm going to go
look for a table. Okay, Let's go. How are we going
to get the water out of this? It's heavy. The thought process is that
this is a house. And what do people have
in their house? Tables and chairs. Exactly. Wait, hold up. Look at this.
Don't move. Yes. Jimmy, Jimmy. it's a chair. Mark's strong. A little help here, Chan. This bag of water is over a hundred pounds. And so my buddy Mark,
being the science YouTuber that he is, had an idea to get it down
from the roof more effectively. But... Our rope broke. We need stronger rope. What you're watching is real. Mark literally deleted
half of our water. We got some bad news. Hurry up, hurry up. The rope broke and
all the water splattered on the ground. This was actually
a very serious problem. Oh, no. Are you kidding me? Mark! Sorry! Don't worry, dude,
we got one bag of water left. Carry this one down, please. And now that half of our water
is actually gone. The only possible way to complete
this seven day challenge would unfortunately,
be to send two of us home. So Kris and Chandler volunteered
to leave the city, leaving Mark and I
with just enough resources to make it the full seven days. Genuinely,
I would be scared if we left Jimmy with anybody other than you. - I think you got it.
- Oh, you guys. But before they left, we wanted to have one final feast
with the whole gang. Now that's a Feastables smores. My hair.
Yummy. Great melting point on the chocolate,
Jimmy, if I may. If you've tried Feastables before,
the ones that used to look like this, you haven't tried Feastables. Our brand new formula tastes
so much better. Genuinely go to Walmart, try Feastables and tell me what you think. It's honestly way better than the old
formula, but don't take my word for it. I just worked at NASA, so. Well, I just had s'mores
so I can go to the boat now? And so we launched a flare
to signal the boat, which was actually pretty cool. Bro, look how cool that looks. Wait, it's lighting up the entire city. But the not cool part is now
that Kris and Chandler are gone, it's just Mark
and I surviving in the city. I feel so lonely. It's our first day
without our friends. But we're going to make
the best of the situation. Our objective for today
is to renovate our shelter. We're going to put up tarps
and windproof this room. We're going to build
a fireplace in here and heat it up. We're going to find shelves and tables. We're going to make this place
looks like a home With some of the ideas we have planned
I might stick around until day 14. He's lying. And so we started exploring
some nearby buildings to find furnishing for our shelter, which is when we found this awesome shelf,
this little table, a massive carpet, and also this metal thing
that was found by our camera guy. Look at this chair. That works still, man. Bro. That's comf. I found a fake TV. We can make it
look like we have a TV now. It's a good find. Wow, that's just so cool, this like courtyard with the arches. Each building in this city
has its own personality. What can we do with these? We could use, like, a vent system
like this. Combined with these,
we can make a fireplace. Like actual wallpaper. We have wallpaper. What do we use it for? To make the house a home,
Jimmy. It's like we went grocery shopping,
but instead we grabbed a bunch of 30-year-old garbage Honey, we're home. We found all this stuff. Now we're going to start decorating. We're no longer surviving,
Jimmy. We're thriving. I like that. We literally spent the next 4 hours moving all the rubble
out of our shelter, which made us pretty thirsty. The water in these sacks
tastes like trash, which is why we all
brought a Cirkul water bottle, because you can put a flavor
cartridge in it and make water taste good. This is my first time
drinking a Cirkul bottle. Delightful experience. You can determine the intensity. So if you're feeling really audacious,
you can have level nine flavor. Or if you're just a wuss,
you can have a level one flavor. I’m trying six. Six. I'll match your six. That tastes awesome. Which flavor are you using? I'm rocking fruit punch
because it's got energy. And you know what we need right now,
Jimmy? Energy. - That's right
- Good thing Cirkul has our back. And now that we had been hydrated, it was time to start crushing
these renovations. When everything's said and done, this room will be the greatest room in
an abandoned city you've ever seen. This is our new shelf. All right, let's see how she looks. See that?
See all that dust? Oh, isn't that satisfying? And now that the shelf is clean,
we can use it to store food. For some reason, over half
the food we packed is chili. And no one here likes chili. That's the non chili row. That's the chili row. This is the Feastables row right there. Now we have a table
to put our Cirkul water bottles. Mark has a 22 ounce bottle.
This is the 32 ounce bottle. And they have a metal double
insulated bottle that you can get for free right now
if you buy ten flavor cartridges. What a steal. It's not a steal.
It's free. All right. That's going to block a lot of wind. With our new door in place, we also hung up this huge tarp, which will allow us
to keep all the heat from the fireplace inside our shelter. Oxygen comes in, fire burns, sends heat in the room,
send smoke out. This is redneck
engineering at its finest. Finally,
after being cold for so long. - All right.
- Look at that. And we have a fire. I can feel the heat coming out. Wait, Jimmy rigged this up
in like ruins from an abandoned city. Anyway, go to DrinkCirkul.com/MrBeast... Or scan the QR code on his face,
if you want to order a Cirkul right now. This is the final room.
We have plenty in the corner. We have our beds
that are now smaller. Tell me this isn't genius. This is Mark's iPad in the TV frame. Obviously some nice lighting,
a furnace that is heating up the room,
a real table with chairs and a shelving unit
with the scraps of food we have left and a dirty towel
we've been sharing. This is survival. But just as our night was going so
well for the fifth day in a row, we heard a broken glass. - Mark.
- I'm right here, dog. What was that? Man, we were having such a good day too. I want to go see who's upstairs. I'm carrying the knife as a threat,
but I'm not going to use it. Hey, if you're up here,
just come out. I want to be best friends with you. Are you serious, you're not pranking me? Bro, I swear to you it was not me. Hello. What is this? Bro!
Oh, my God. This is the most Mark Rober thing
I've ever seen. What the heck? You swore! Yeah, so turns out Mark was pranking us, and he was the one dropping
these bottles the whole time. I've got a remote control here.
But no one suspects it. I can be in my sleeping bag and I can start launching glass
bottles through the roof. Freak everyone out. Oh, my gosh. I thought I could trust you. Now that Mark's not pranking me,
we re-rigged his contraption. Feastables me. There you go. I'll take one. I got one as well. That's kind of cool. To be honest, it was pretty easy
to forgive Mark because we only had one day left
in this challenge. Good morning. Good morning abandoned city. Abandoned city, abandoned city. It's so much colder out here
than it is in there. Let's go back. It's now the morning of day six. All the modifications
we did were phenomenal and it was at least ten degrees
warmer. - That was amazing.
- Slept incredible. Mark, on our last real day,
I say we go have some fun. - Yeah!
- Yeah! Jimmy, is that a kayak? I know what we should do with it. Now someone can kayak in this pool. Me and Mark really did have a lot of fun. Played baseball, played soccer. Mark even taught me how to skip
rocks scientifically. There it is. And even screaming at each other
from different sides of the city. - Mark!
- What! Let's throw things off the roof
at the same time! Great idea! To be honest,
doing all these kind of dumb things really did take our minds off
of how lonely this city really was. Yeah! And by the time
the final day of this challenge arrived after cleaning up camp,
we only had one objective in mind. Leaving this
place and never coming back. I’m here! - I’m here!
- Freedom! Huge shout out to Mark. 
He didn't have to do this.  He has his own channel is very busy. Here's the channel.
I appreciate you. And let's get out of here. Let's go. By the way,
I'm giving away $10,000 a day for the next 20 days to people who
buy Feastables. Go buy the new formula, it tastes amazing."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOEfDvr4DcQ,"Face Your Biggest Fear To Win $800,000",1322,20240210,en,"My friend Mac is about to experience
the scariest moment of his life. I'm just going to let you know
I'm not afraid of anything. - We'll see.
- You cannot scare me. Seal him up. You have to survive 10 minutes
with a thousand spiders to move on. Release the spiders. Start the timer. The reason we're doing
this is because Mack said no matter how hard I tried,
I can't scare him. Would you say you're scared now? Getting there a little bit. - A little bit?
- Yeah. And this is only one of many fears
Mack will face in this video. Oh, good. And if he can successfully face all
of the fears, he will win $800,000. I'm not going to lie, this was way more gnarly
than I thought it would be. Three, two, one. Lift it up. Lift it up. Oh yeah. Congratulations on passing
the first challenge. Let's go. But Mack has to finish
all of these fears if he wants to win
the $800,000 prize. Mack, I know you're blindfolded,
but trust me. Just walk up this ramp. Raise us up. Why are you taking a knee? What is...? Stand up. Stand up.
You're fine. You're fine. No, no, no, no. All right, Jimmy. Okay, you can hold on to it. That's cute. Oh my God! Okay. Mack, take off your blindfold. Welcome to challenge number two. The next fear
is the fear of heights. You're going to stand
on the end of that plank, unclip this so you'll be
connected to nothing. Nah, dude. Press that button
and then freefall 200 feet, and without knowing how,
trust, I'll catch you. No! No! You're shaking. Yeah, of course I'm shaking. I'm going to fall off of this
without a harness on. - Yeah.
- I can't even see the ground. Be very careful. Mack, I'm just going to tell you, even though you can't see
the ground, you are very, very high. Oh, my God, Mack. All you have to do is unclip it
and press that button. Oh my... I want you to look at me
in the eyes right now and tell me that I'm going to fall
and something's going to catch me. Something will break your fall. I promise. Oh my... You're literally attached to nothing. Oh, my God. - The clip is gone.
- Oh, my God. You don't have to do it. If you want to, you can tap out and just admit
that you are wrong and you do get scared. No way. God, dude. I would have to say
you look pretty scared. Oh, my God. Five, four, three, two... one. Godspeed. Godspeed. Zero. Let's go! I can't believe you did it. He's a psycho. And if you're wondering
who my psychotic friend Mack is he's actually a contestant
from a previous challenge video. And sadly,
he ended up losing $800,000. But now he is on challenge
three of six to attempt to win that money back. Here we are. - Yeah.
- The next challenge. What'd you get? A $5 car and put
$800,000 inside of it? As you can see,
this car is pointed towards a lake. I'm guessing you're going to want me
to drive the car into the lake? No. That would be dangerous. As you can see,
there's no gas pedal. Obviously,
you can't drive it in the lake. Yeah, I'm so stupid. Why would I think
that I can drive it into the lake? - Yeah. Yeah.
- Stupid. Yeah. Which is why we're going to drop him
in the lake. Bring in the crane! Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy. It is getting real now.
Okay. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. All right, Mack,
listen up and listen good. Once we drop you at this lake,
the car will quickly begin to sink. And in the back seat is the 800 grand you've been competing
for divvied up into eight duffel bags. However many bags you can save
from this sinking car determines how much money you'll continue
competing for in this video. And whatever you leave
behind is gone forever. Oh my gosh, dude. I will never tell you
that I'm scared, but I'm about as close
as you can be right now to that feeling. I can tell. Before we drop your car, I'm
going to give you a one offer. If you quit right now
and admit I scared you, I'll give you $100,000. And we call it even. Yeah. All right. He's not going to take it. - There's not a gosh darn chance.
- I knew that was going... Hey, Nolan, take that.
I knew he was going to do this. I lost it all last time. It's not happening again. Three! Two! One! Oh, my God. Drop him! Hey Mack! You've got about 20 seconds
to break out of that car before it sinks under the water. Mack, the car is going under. Hurry up. Oh, God. That car is gone. That sunk so fast. Oh, my God. He's out. He's alive. Hey Mack! Nolan, go grab that bag from him. Somebody grab this. The scariest part about this
challenge is every second the car sinks deeper into the water,
making it harder to get to and harder to see. So if Mack wants to keep
all of the prize money. He really needs to be moving
as fast as possible. But as you can see,
that's not going to be easy. Nolan, come here.
Take it. Mack continued saving bag. Oh my God. After bag, after bag. Mack, you're crazy. But on top of the fact that the car
is sinking deeper and deeper. What Mack hasn't realized yet
is that the last two bags of money are actually seatbelted
into the back seat of the car. Dude, Mack could be in an action movie,
honestly. Well, he was like a borderline
Olympic swimmer earlier in his life, which is why I did this fear. Yeah, but it's like 40 feet down
and the water is freezing cold. How can you hold your breath out? He got another bag. Well, you got $700,000 on the boat. Just stop now.
Just stop now. Just leave it on the bottom of lake. - We can do the next.
- No. All right.
He doesn't care. At this point, the car was literally at the bottom
of this 45 foot deep lake, making it almost impossible for Mack
to retrieve the last $100,000. Yeah you know,
I really cannot. It's black down there.
There's nothing. Are you officially calling it? I can't see the car, Jimmy.
It's gone, yes. The boat's tilting. You are very athletic. Do you like this video better
or the other video better? Dude, this video is
like 10 times as intense. I know. And even though this looks very crazy,
there's actually seven safety divers on standby
to make sure Mack didn't die. Your prize is now 700 grand, but from here on out, it's
all or nothing. Mack has to face
the three remaining fears to walk out of this
with his 700 grand. - This one might be the hardest one.
- Okay Is it grosser than spiders? Just come on in. Inside this room is a metal box. In order to progress, you'll need to reach inside the box
and pull out what's inside. And before
you put your hand in the box, we're going to need you
to sign this. It just basically says that you can't sue me
if anything in there hurts you. Just sign right there. All right, we got it signed. What is it,
like an animal or something? There are things in this box. Just step up here. You put your hand
in one of these holes. Okay. And there's a thing in here
you need to pull out. Dude, that is freaky as...
Okay. I'm just going to make sure it's moving. - Stop.
- Okay, go for it. Clearly it has not touched him yet. No matter what, once you grab onto it,
you have to pull it out. What you grabbed is our brand new Feastable bars. We got all new branding
and a better tasting formula. - Let's try it together.
- I am not going to go soft on you. I'm going to tell you
honestly what I think. Okay, that's pretty good. The new formula is milkier, creamier. We have our all new crunch flavor,
the milk chocolate flavor, almond flavor, my personal favorite,
and peanut butter. These new and improved
Feastables bars are rolling out now. Give us a couple of days
to get them on the shelves of your local Walmart,
Target, 7-Eleven. And I cannot wait
to see what you think of them. All right, Mack,
you ready for the next fear? Jimmy,
I've been in this exact same room, and I've had a bunch of money
on the line before. Yeah. I'll tell you what. If you give me 500 grand right now,
I'll walk. Do you guys hear this man? - Jimmy.
- Who asked for $500,000? - 400 grand?
- No. Hear me out. If you said 200, maybe 250,
I would have considered it. - How about 350?
- No. All right, let's go. Next challenge. I knew he'd break. All right, I might've lied. That one wasn't actually that hard. But this next one is actually based
on one of the scariest things I've ever done. There's no way. How about quickly he pieced it together? Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
There's actually no way. - Come on.
- There is actually no way, Jimmy. Is it that obvious what it is? What gave it away?
The tombstone with your name? Oh, Jesus. For the next challenge, we are going
to bury you alive for 24 hours. No way, dude. And you can get out
whatever you want, but you don't know what time it is. And if you leave before the 24 hour
mark, you'll lose everything. That's a good fear. Yes. For once, I'm on the other side. Yeah bro! Oh, my gosh. It might get a little cold. Nolan, don't mess it up, please. I'll try not to. This is from my nightmares, man. It feels wrong being on
the other side, but also fun. What the... Oh, this is so freaky. The funny thing is that
the timer hasn't even started yet because you aren't fully buried. It feels wrong saying this,
but can you bury me faster? As you wish, Mack! Bring in the extra hand. Stop it, stop it, stop,
stop, stop, stop. Let's officially start the timer. Looks like 24 hours just started and I'm already freaked, so this ain't going to be good. Mack, see that rope above your head?
Can you pull it for me real quick? - Is this a trick?
- No. Next time you pull that bell,
we will dig you up. And if it does not say above
24 hours, you lose everything. I will burn your house down. And also the $700,000. Yeah, I was like everything? Everything.
Sweet dreams Macketh! All right, don't throw the walkie talkie. Was it that predictable? I already know they threw it,
and I'm not even up there. There's so much more fun
to be on this side of it. And to make sure Mack doesn't die
in his own grave. He's going to be wearing
this wristband that directly tells us
his heart rate and vitals. And no, it does not give him any way
of knowing what time it is. Basically, I need to figure out
how to keep track of the time. Here's my strategy. I could try to stay awake
for 2 hours, sleep for 10 hours, and then I would be
halfway done with the challenge and I could just do that twice
and that would be good. With Mack's plan now in place, his first step was to pass
the time for the next 2 hours. Well, it's no Feastable bar, but I guess that makes hunger stop. But it was pretty obvious
he was quickly getting bored. Dude, you got to be honest,
there’s not much going on inside this room. That's the whole point. And Mack being bored this early is a pretty telltale sign
that he may not be too good at this because already within 45 minutes, Mack's idea of time
was horrendously off. I think it's been about 2 hours. I'm going to try to get about 10 hours of sleep, which should
put me at the halfway mark. Even though the pro to sleeping
is that it'll help Mack past time faster. First night sleeping in the coffin. The con is it's very difficult
for him to keep track of how long he's been buried,
especially when he's not even able to stay asleep
for more than 30 minutes at a time. I have no idea what time it is right now. I'm a little creeped out. Hopefully for the love of God it's
been over 12 hours. I think that's where we're at. And because when I did the challenge, I was
constantly woken up by my friends... Jimmy Jam. I thought I'd give Mack the same
joyful experience. Wake up, Mack.
Are you okay? Dude, you look like
you just got hit by a truck. Kind of feels like
I did just get hit by a truck. If I was to legitimately guess
how many hours in I am, I think it's like... The longer Mack stayed in the coffin, the less he seemed to know
what time it was. It might be hour 16. And because we like to build
a lot of suspense on this channel for the remainder of this fear, you're not going to know
how long he's been in there either. And even though Mack
wanted to ensure that he was going to be there
long enough, it was clear that claustrophobia
was getting to him. Being in this coffin is scary. Like... That... And the longer I'm in here,
the worse I feel. It's a crazy feeling. But eventually, when we saw
Mack begin to grab that rope, we knew he was thinking about ringing
that bell. That's the face of somebody
that's about to ring this bell soon. There's no way it's been under 24 hours. God, I'm nervous. I've been in one of these videos
before. And I lost everything. And the only reason
I even am back here at all and got a second chance
is actually because of you guys. Me screwing up that second chance
all comes down to if I know for a fact it's been 24 hours. I really hope I'm not making
a mistake right now. Mack. Buddy, pal, how you doing? Jimmy, I'm pretty nervous. I don't want to accidentally
reveal the time, so no comment. Jimmy, I don't know how you do this
for seven days, dude. I do not feel well in here. Yeah. Have you got to the point
where you start to lose blood flow in your legs and you feel like your back
is going to fall out of your body? Jimmy, I'm thinking
about pulling this thing. No comment. Jimmy, I'll give you 50 bucks back
if you tell me what time it is. No comment. All right, I got a comment for you. Just get a shovel ready, all right? Three. Oh, my gosh,
he's about to do it. Two... This is it. One. Stop the timer. And now that Mack has made his decision. There was just one
last thing I had to do. Do you mind if I tell them about
Shopify while we unbury you? You have got to be kidding. Shopify is a platform
that helps entrepreneurs get started down the path they want. Sometimes starting
a business can be scary, like getting covered in spiders
or being buried alive. I can tell you,
you do not want to be buried alive. But Shopify is here to help. If I hadn't started my own business,
I wouldn't have been able to go to all the crazy places
like Antarctica and make videos
like these for you guys. And just like billions of other
people have done with Shopify. You can get started today
on your business right now. Mack, you want to know
how long you were in there? I have a feeling you're not going
to tell me until you dig me up. You are correct. And one of the perks of owning
my own business is I can do fun things like send
one of my friends to the Superbowl. Mack, Karl and Nolan
each have their very own football for sale, and whoever's football
sells the most. I'm going to give you tickets
to the Super Bowl and I'm going to bury the other one
alive. All that matters is that you
download the Shop app and vote from one of them by buying
either Nolan's or Karl's football. And now that I can afford this
video, let's see if Mack loses $700,000. - Hi!
- Hi! Hey, Jimmy. There you go! Welcome to the outside world. Now that you are out of the coffin,
let's see if you were in there for 24 hours. If the number I reveal is lower
than 24 hours, then you lose $700,000. I feel like I'm going to throw up. Three... Two... One... 36 hours! That is what I am talking about. He scares me. Congratulations, Mack. This means that you are now
just one challenge away from winning all this money. Let's go. You should probably go shower first. Yeah, I smell not great. So far in this video,
Mack has shown me It is very difficult to scare him, but the final challenge of this video
may just be Mack's worst fear ever. And that's because
the final challenge of this video is a 1 to 1 recreation of the
challenge he failed on last time. The last challenge. Hold this in front of your face.
Don't look. - Hey, I'm not looking.
- Don't look. - I'm not looking.
- All right, keep your eyes closed. Don't open them. Don't open your eyes. Keep walking. Don't open them. Don't open them. All right, open them. No, no, no.
I'm not doing that again. Come over here. No! Jimmy, I do not want to do this again. Stand here where the cameras
can see you. - No!
- Okay. The last challenge
is the fear of failure. We recreated the set where
he lost $800,000 in this video And like last time,
the rules are extremely simple. There are four stages. Each has its own cookie with a shape on it. You have to cut out all the shapes
without breaking a cookie. And if you do break a cookie,
you lose $700,000. And for you specifically, it will have been the second time
it's happened. This is from my nightmares, man. I do not want to be here again. Well, good.
Because I have an offer for you. You can quit right now and walk away with this 300 grand
or risk it for the biscuit. And if you finish this final
challenge, win $700,000. This is actually like a
very, very big decision. Yeah, because that's not quite
enough, is it? It's less than half. But if you lose again, that is $1.5
million lost on this set. Are you sure? He's hitting it. Mac, I know this is hard, but you're going to have
to make a decision here. Do you want to go home with $300,000 or do you want to risk it all
for this final challenge? All right, fine.
I'm doing it. All right. To be honest, I'm glad.
I want you to win this whole thing. If you look at this iPad right here, this is exactly how long it took Mack
to get through all four stages last time he did the challenge,
34 minutes and 54 seconds. So that's exactly how long
I'm going to give you again. Starting now. Don't break the cookie while opening. There you go. Even though
he's going quick right now, might not be in his best interest because if he accidentally snaps a cookie,
he loses. 34 minutes. You did it that quick? Scan, scan, scan, scan. It's green. This is a much different deal
than last time. So I'm going to take my sweet time
cutting the circle out. Let's go. He is flying through this. Why is it so much harder to open? Probably because you're like
freaking out. You want me to try? Open it. Okay. Hold my iPad. Okay. It's very hard to open. What are you guys doing? I don't want to be responsible for that. Be careful. Theoretically, Mack's strategy makes sense. Getting through
the easier shapes fast to save all the time for umbrella,
which he lost $800,000 off. You literally still have 32 minutes left. Yeah. Well, I'm going to need
all 32 of those for umbrella. That is borderline impossible. - Move out.
- I'm moving. Open it. Allow me. Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap.
Let's go. Mack, stop breaking my set. Bro, you guys got to make
these easier to open. There's just no need to rush.
You're literally using no time. I mean, you might need to go slower
on this one because it's a lot trickier. This one is pretty hard,
not even close umbrella. Trying to get to the race
before I start racing. God, this is so hard. Oh my gosh. Well, I don't need that anymore. Maybe it didn't break all the way through? Okay. He still had 29 minutes left. He did the first two in 4 minutes I don't know why I did this. Oh, my God. I did that twice? Here. Give me your hand. No. Jimmy, please.
I don't want to leave yet. No, Jimmy. Nah, dude. I don't even know
how to feel right now. Right here.
Come on. I have, like, so much time. Yeah. I'm still just not sure
why you were going so fast. The umbrella, I just know
that umbrella takes forever. Yeah. Okay. Mack told me in this video
that there was nothing that I could do to scare him. And after putting him through
spiders, a sinking car, and more,
I really did start to believe him. Godspeed. The only thing that ended up
getting to Mack... was the fear of his own failure. Godspeed."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krsBRQbOPQ4,"$1 vs $250,000,000 Private Island!",1019,20240127,en,"This is a $250 million private
island. Literally, anything you could ever
want is on this island. And I'm going to show you
the difference between this and a $150
million luxury island, a massive $45 million island,
a $5 million frozen island all the way down to the cheapest
private island in the world. That thing I'm starting to realize
might not all fit on it. First step on my brand new island. Here's your dollar. Thank you, sir. - Thank you for selling it to me.
- It's yours now, buddy. Let's check out
what I just bought. My first impressions is that it's a lot smaller than I thought. When you pay a dollar, you get a random pile of bricks,
an old toilet. I found the restroom. And a bunch of random wooden poles. There's more poles than
square feet on this thing. They're actually called pylons. Let's pile onto that boat and leave. And as you can see, there's nothing
here, so I'm going to blow it up. But later in this video,
we're going to a $150 million island and also a quarter
billion dollar super island. But first, we're going to head over
to the $1 million dollar island called Monkey Island. Yes, you heard me right. This island is literally swarmed
with hundreds of monkeys. I can see why it's called
Monkey Island. - What's this monkey?
- It's Odie. Odie took my orange. Okay. Monkey see food, monkey take. All the monkeys on this island have a strategy
for interacting with people. They gaslight you into thinking that you're friends,
and then they steal your food. You can have it.
You can have it. I love this monkey. There's a monkey on the boat. And if you're wondering
where are you and your friends are going to sleep
on this island, Suspended above the water are six
luxury cabanas, which house both humans and monkeys. The monkey's grabbing the GoPro, Jimmy. Sir, we need this for filming. I just need to borrow this. Thank you. Okay. I got my camera back.
You want... Oops. He wants your hat. Okay, you can have that, sir. By the end of this,
I'm going to be naked. The monkeys are stealing everything. And the monkeys are not even
the coolest part of this island. See, this island isn't
even an island at all. It's actually the top of a massive
underwater plant network that emerged from the sand and water to create this illusion of an island
that we see today. Is this a milion dollar island
or a million dollar bush? - Because there's no land.
- What do you think? I don't know. I think an island
is what you make of it. And on the other side of the island,
there's even a private relaxation area And a beachfront massage parlor. Nolan! I'm trying not to fall in the water. I'm about to get a massage
with a monkey. That's really cool. Notice how all the water
around you is freezing. What? That took a lot of effort. And we put that much effort in
to convey that the $5 million Island
is very cool. And where we're going next,
most of the year looks like this, but it's going to look like this. No joke. This island is so cold right now
that the lake surrounding it is actually frozen solid,
which means to get there, we're going to be using
an interesting vehicule. We're literally hovering. Yeah. Apparently snowmobiles would have
been too basic for this island. It just had to be hovercrafts. This is awesome. Talking about arriving in fashion. And it only took about 30 seconds being outside the hovercraft
for the gang to be frozen solid. - How cold is it?
- It's zero degrees celsius. It's pretty cold, man He’s more like a 70 guy. So, they hurried over to these futuristic
self-heating huts to stay warm. Oh, this is so small. Wait, there's no
room for you in here. We're gonna have to cuddle then. And these huts are able to stay here
completely year round because they're able to both float
on warm, peaceful lake water. But they also do
just fine in the dead of winter. But at least in the winter, you get a great view
of the northern lights. For $5 million, you basically
get a winter wonderland. And while staying on this island, you're given unlimited
five star food. I think he thinks we speak Finnish. And even though this island comes
with a luxury cabin to stay in. Oh, this is beautiful. Fine, I'll take it. Jimmy, buy it for me. The gang ended up spending
most of their time on the frozen lake where they were able to ride
an actual dog sled. He took your glove. Oh my Gosh! This is the best island. I don't know how
any island is going to beat this. Maybe one where I could feel my hands. And Karl's hands are in luck
because this next island is not only warm but more expensive
than all of the other islands combined. This island is tiny,
but arguably one of the most luxurious ones out there. Okay, let's go check the house. Feast! We're stoked to have you
as our guest. We hope you have a blast.
Just don't break anything. Yo, we should try to break one thing. Oh, nice bathroom. Usually rich people like showers that
can fit like 30 to 1000 people in them. This time,
they chose a reasonable shower. When you pay $16 million in addition to a shower,
that's the size of the $1 island, the private island comes
with this helicopter that's apparently too
big for this island. We have jet skis. We have a submarine.
Another submarine to the right. We have a shark submarine
over there. There's almost a submarine
for each of us. Boys, do whatever you want.
Have fun. You're out. You Yeah! Yeah! I’m going really fast. I love private islands. Karl, if you had one wish,
what would it be? To get off of this thing! Yeah! We're underwater! I am a fish now. After Ludwig and Karl kissed
the sea at 500 miles per hour, we went back to shore
to take a little breather. Yeah. Ludwig's
going to jump out of a helicopter. He really is. No, wait, I'm not...
Wait, what? Any last words? I love you, Mom.
I'm sorry. This helicopter is taking the boys
up into the air and letting them jump and
freefall into the ocean. Oh, my God. This is crazy.
We shouldn't be doing this. This is only a $16 million island, and we're jumping out of a helicopter. He's about to jump. Oh my Gosh! Oh wait! They jump! There he goes. Whoever said money doesn't buy
happiness, doesn't own that private island,
because I'm pretty happy. And now the $45 million island, this island is so big,
you can't even fit it all in frame. Oh, hey, I didn't realize
they were waiting on us. - Hi!
- Hi! I always feel uncomfortable
when I pull up to places and people are just standing
potentially for hours waiting on me. Hello! We have some blueberry smoothies
here. Is it alcoholic? No, it's not. He's not 21 now we'll take you guys up
and we'll show you around Royal Island a little bit. Let's see what
$45 million gets us. It's a long path. The path is longer than
the last island. For $45 million, this island comes with
a mansion and its own beachside bar and private chef. - Can I give it a flip?
- Sure. That's not too bad. And outside of the
mansion is a hot tub overlooking the
cove where the jet skis are and of course, a pool
with the best view I've ever seen. Does this look as cool on camera
as it does in real life? And if for some reason, you
don't want to stay in the mansion, there's five luxury beachside cabanas
you can pick from. Jimmy, may I? You may. May I? You may. I have class. But even after messing around
with all of the amenities. Why are we playing ping pong
when we have an entire island? It's important to note that that's
not what makes this island special. All the way at the other end of the island are century-old ruins
that we are yet to explore. Dibs on driving. Oh, no. All right, ready? Yeah. We're going to go off
roading a little bit and head to the back
of the island now. How does Karl
always end up driving? - Because I'm awesome.
- Big bump! Dude, this is like a safari. Yeah, you're going four times
the speed limit.  I mean, I don't know if
there's cops that will stop you, but I'm just letting you know. Is there a jail on this island? No Jail. Oh there's no jail? And when we finally ran out of road
to drive on, we started to make our way through what used to be a village of people on this island,
over a hundred years ago. - This used to be a bar?
- Yes You want to walk under this
100-year-old giant thousand-pound slab? Sure, surely it won't fall
on top of me. Dude, if today was the day that it'd fell,
you couldn't even be mad. Nolan, come over here before you die. And just past the ruins is easily
the best view on the entire island. Yeah, it gets better. We were driving for so long. I forgot we were on an island. The island starts over there, comes
all the way around, wraps all the way around here. Goes down that coastline
all the way up over there. I'll be honest, I wouldn't pay $45 million for a big jungle
with some ancient ruins. But I'm sure some rich guy will. This next island is arguably
the second most expensive island that money can buy. This is the $150 million island. It comes with eight
luxurious mega mansions. And the best part is it is completely powered
by solar panels and wind turbines. It's home to some of the most
exotic animals I've ever seen, and took over four decades to build. This island will literally blow your mind. When I think of a private island,
this is what I think of. That's good,
because this is a private island. All right. And apparently the first thing you
need to do here is wash your hands. Make sure you don't taint the
island with your outside world germs. I've already
washed my germs. Does everyone who come here
gets a coconut? I mean, they're not running low. True. I don't know if it's
because this place is so fancy. Or maybe they just
heard about Karl's driving, Yeah! But each of us ended up
with our own personal driver. I have a feeling this is going to be
a once-in-a-lifetime experience. - Unless you come back.
- That might be out of my price range. And even though this island costs
$150 million, you can actually rent it yourself, for the extremely low price
of 140 grand per day. I didn't even realize
we just went up a mountain. I've heard this is the most
luxurious private island in the world. It is. - The view is insane.
- This is the great house. But before we were able to explore the great house, my dumb
friends got distracted by a turtle. There's a turtle? Get in there. Yeah. All right, you guys
go to the rest of the island. This island is so extra
that for every one person in your party, they have ten staff
members waiting on your every need. There's a bunch of people over there
like here's drinks, here's food. What do you want to do
over the next few days? And we're just like ""turtle"". And of course, Nolan, of all my friends
wanted to take advantage of this. Yes! Yeah! What's everyone up to over here? We're playing pool. With 10 people? They're my hype crew. You don't have to hang out
with him to make him feel good. I will be sad
if you don't sit down and relax. If you need attention,
don't make them stand there. It's only been an hour,
but I'll say it. This is the best island so far. On top of all of that, the island has a house
with a driving range on the roof where you can literally hit
golf balls into the ocean. Because these are made of fish food. You should probably hit it
further so you don't hit someone. Look at all those flamingos.
There's so much I can't process it. Flamingos in the sky. They are everywhere. They don't love us
unless we give them food. Come here, my brethren. But flamingos aren't the only
exotic animals on this island. - Bro.
- That's a dinosaur. This is so cool. And believe it or not, this turtle could theoretically
live over 200 years. Mr. Tortoise, my name is Jimmy. If my descendants, descendants,
descendants come here. Tell them I was awesome. And afterwards, we got swarmed by a bunch of lemurs
that live on this island over here. Get over here! Jimmy, I don't know if you noticed
that there's two lemurs on your head. Yeah, I know.
I'm trying not to move... - I'll put food on there.
- Please don't. And if you're wondering where
all these exotic animals came from, most of them, sadly, are endangered
species and are all on this island because the owner, Richard Branson, brought all of them
here to help prevent them from going extinct. But the most endangered
animal on the island were the mermaids
that serve you sushi. Yeah! Mermaids and sushi. This is luxury. Mermaids! - Do you guys want sushi?
- I wouldn't say no. Is that cannibalism? Yes. It's like a family reunion.
Get over here. There's honestly
so much on this island. We can't even film it all. We play tennis, we play basketball. We explore yet another mansion. I did my first cold plunge. You get the idea. There's
so much to do on this island. It's actually overwhelming. This one's actually pretty intense. I'm like actually scared. - You know what else is intense?
- What? The final island.
I'll see you there. Why are we still here? And on the way to the $250
million Island, we stopped in shark infested waters
because I have to pay for this video. And now
that I'm surrounded by sharks and what
feels like my worst nightmare, I'm going to tell you guys,
about Stumble Guys. Bro, they're so close. Oh, my gosh. And the worst part is I'm not
coming out until I'm done with this ad Stumble Guys is a free-to-play
mobile player game where 32 people compete
for the crown. You have to be an absolute maniac
to do this. Not even Stumble Guys
could pay me to do this. Why are you all here, sharks? They're so close,
they're so close. And for their new season they went all out with the new
MrBeast skins, animations and emotes. Okay, square head, have it... Bro, this is nuts. I want to make sure
there's enough sharks for Jimmy. They also added a brand new level, but you have to follow a pattern
as long as possible to stay alive. And the longer you live,
the harder it gets. Is a shark hitting me? I think the sharks are hitting the cage.
It's rocking! Oh, this is scary. Not only that, I also just released my new toolkit
so you can build your own MrBeast level. This is one of their best seasons ever. You need to try my new MrBeast level,
plus build your own. And I want
to see what you guys come up with. The sharks keep hitting the cage.
So I'm going to get out of here. Make sure to download
Stumble Guys for free so I don't have to go back
in the shark cage. You're alive. Let's go do more things that have
nothing to do with sharks. Please. And now that I've paid off the debt
I've incurred from this video, let's visit the $250 million island. This is a $250 million
private island. This extraordinary island
has an entire amusement park with over a dozen waterslides. It also has its own hot air balloon
and just about every activity you could imagine. And we have it all to ourselves. There are no other guests here,
but out of every feature you've seen on these islands so far,
this one stands above the rest. In the middle of the island
is a massive waterslide, even though literally eight year
olds ride that waterslide, I might still chicken out
because I'm afraid of heights. But before taking on the water
slide, we checked out the other features,
like how there's over a hundred jetskis on this island. It's a bit overkill. And not to mention there's a literal zip lines
that span across manmade beaches. What's the helmet for? What am I going to hit? The ground, bro. Because sometimes people fall off. - This is like really scary.
- Yeah. - Good luck.
- Thank you. Karl, you're kind of far behind. This is awesome. This is actually not that crazy. And if you own this island,
you can host over 13,000 of your friends at any of these
five gargantuan pools. Oh, this kind of looks like
it was made in Minecraft. And it's so funny
just seeing my two friends in it. Nolan looks like a tiny speck. For $250 million, this island,
of course, has exotic animals. Is that a peacock? Sir, I need to take
you in for questioning. Sir? And even every game you can imagine, I wish there is the 13,000 people
that are normally here, to watch how bad he is at Cornhole. Is that soccer pool? This island has things
I didn't even know existed. But something I noticed is
there were way too many lifeguards at this island
for just the four of us. How many lifeguards
are on this island? - Over 100
- Really? With this many lifeguards,
you would have to try to drown. So I thought it'd be fun
if we gave them all the day off. Has anyone ever rented
this island before? No one. - This is the first.
- Dude, you are leaning back. You look way too relaxed. And after all 100 lifeguards went down, they decided to hype up
the boys and I for our turn on the slide. Here we go! Oh my Gosh! Boys, you want to know
what's even scarier than that? What? That one. Why is it so terrifying tonight? It looks so scary. We can skip it. Towering at over 135 feet tall. This is the tallest water
slide in all of North America. I don't even know what I'm looking at. It's like a skyscraper. But I'm scared. Daredevil's Peak.
What a soothing name. Very inviting. We're so up. It's kind of freaking me out. All right, we made it to the top. Are you guys just waiting for us up
here? Yeah. Listen
to how intense the wind is up here. Oh, don't look down. Look how crazy the island
looks. Oh, my God. - Karl!
- No. Nolan! Oh! Would you say nose goes is enforceable? Nose goes is enforceable. There we go! The lifeguards said you got to go, Nolan. I love you, Mom. I'll see you on the other side. All right, go. Oh my God! Oh, I got hit by a truck. Let's do this. You better come down after me. Okay. Oh, God. Why is it so fast? Is it actually that scary? I'm going to do this
for your entertainment, even though giant rides scare me. Here we go. That is going so fast. And even though
I was basically just drowning the entire time down this waterslide, I gotta say this whole island
was pretty awesome."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ESeQBeikKs,"Protect $500,000 Keep It!",934,20240113,en,"These tanks are literally about
to rain missiles on this $500,000. And any money that doesn't
get destroyed, I'm giving to Blake. But lucky for you, I'm
going to give you my credit card. And you can spend as much money as you want trying to protect this money
from all of the missiles we're going
to be firing at your money. - So I just build whatever I want?
- Whatever you want. But you only have 24 hours
before we fire the tanks. I need metal! Let’s go! Alright, let’s go boys!
He’s running! We're kicking this off
with a sprint. All right, Blake,
where are we heading to first? - I’m thinking the Junkyard.
- Blake's first 3 hours consisted of sourcing any metal
he could find to protect his money. I mean, this looks like they have metal,
even if that meant spending $30,000. Definitely want that. Want that
All the trucks. - Basically, you just want every car here.
- Yeah. Can you give me any of your shipping
containers? Let’s go out back! Yeah. This is good. Those would work well
if I put them on top of the money. And is if buying out
the entire store wasn't enough. Blake did the same thing
at two other industrial stores. Well, everything I get from you today I would need within
the next 12 hours. 12 hours? - I’m willing to pay double.
- Ok, we’ll get it. It is very quick
to throw my money around. $15,000 And while we waited,
for the materials to be delivered. We headed back to the money, and
Blake laid out his official plan. You just spent the last hour
strategizing. What did you come up with
to stop the tanks from destroying your money? Step one I want to put a shipping
container over the money. That is actually genius. Step two, giant water tanks. Do you think that's your best
defense? I think it's good,
but it's not the best. Step three these containers
filled with bricks. hay and wood. Step four is my best defense. A fortress of strategically angled
cars from the last video that I saw. Those bullets are going to hit
those cars and ricochet elsewhere. If he actually builts
everything you see here, I will be flabbergasted. - Let's get to work.
- Good luck. Unfortunately for Blake, it wouldn't be for another 4 hours
until his materials were delivered. So he hired some construction
workers to help get the job done. I'm building a complete fortress. If we dropped the atomic bomb
on this thing, the money's not going anywhere. This is like
an industrial construction site. It started to look like Blake might actually have a chance
at protecting his money. But even if the 500 grand survives
those tanks, the tanks are actually only the first
of four phases of attacks Blake will have to defend. And believe me when I say this,
they're going to get much more challenging. For the rest of the night. Blake and his crew worked tirelessly
to defend the money, but by the time the sun rose,
they still weren't quite done. Looking good. Looking good. That's the money.
The tanks are over there. What is this car here for? This is like my inventory back
here, dude. Put your inventory
between the money and the tank. Give me 10 minutes.
And that white car will be ready. I mean, you have 5 minutes. I don't think I
even have time to do anything else. Time is up. Stop stop, time is up. Drop it. Drop it right there. Go far away. Blake, time is officially ended. Seems pretty sturdy. Let's go fire some tanks. I've been up for about 25 hours now. Just building and building
and building. I mean, I'm looking at it now,
and it looks great, But then I turn around
and I see these five beasts, and then I see these shells
that they're working with. I really had no idea
they're going to be that big. You think a shipping container is
stopping that? Hopefully three of them are. Oh, man. All right, it's time.
Load up the tanks. All right. These five tanks aimed at your money
are about to fire 20 rounds. Blake, fire the first shot. There’s so much dust. Oh my Gosh! Look at his face.
Look at Blake's face. No way his money is safe. So only 19 more right? 19 more to go. Chandler Fire! This is way too much fun. Oh, my God. All the way back here. I can count eight holes
in that shipping container. Yeah, I see those holes. - No, shot his money is safe.
- I’d ask you how you're feeling. Well, we might as well fire
the last few shots. Let's just get this over with. Five shots. Four shots remain. Three shots remain. How much money do you have back
there? Like half a… Two remain. And of course, Blake,
you have to fire the last shell. The honor is mine. After this, we'll see
if you have any money left. Let's go. Oh, he's running. He's so fast. Is there any money? Wait, it's still there! Yes! Blake, it looked like
your money survived. We got a fresh stack. I know you're happy. We're moving on to phase two of four
and in 24 hours, we’re going to blow up the biggest bomb we've ever blown up
in our history of the channel around this money. Are you going to drop it
or are you going to shoot it? I'm glad you asked.
I'll be right back. Blake, what do you think is
in those green crates? I don't know, dude
it looks like… Here, I’ll answer for you. This is a hundred crates
filled to the brim with TNT. How are you even allowed to do that? I'm not sure it's legal. And while we prepared
one of the biggest explosions in YouTube history. Blake began to strategize
on how to keep his money safe. Step one, we got to take everything
flammable out of here, man. All the wood has got to go. Step two water tanks. Step three. I want to move
the shipping containers that I got. I just want to close them in
into the other shipping containers. Then step four is just walls,
cement, bricks, cars, if I have to. Explosion
is a lot worse than the tanks. This is bigger than that safe that blew up? Yes. Every single
thing inside that, destroyed. The first
time he lost $250,000 in this video. Are we going to repeat it? No. And because at this point, Blake
had been awake for over 24 hours, he trusted the construction workers to finish the job
while he got a good night's rest. Yeah, I'm going to bed. Good night,
guys. This is Blake going dark. And because he was so exhausted, Blake slept for way
longer than he planned. All right.
I got a good night's sleep. About to find out how much progress
was really done overnight. Like half… Empty. That means nothing has happened
since I've been gone. And with only 6 hours remaining,
Blake did what he could by covering his weak spots with spare parts,
bricks and more cars. Looking good in here, looking real good. - Oh, Mr. Jimmy,
- What am I about to witness? If you listen closely,
you can hear beeping. It's actually a school bus
coming in. It's going to be plopped
right where you're standing. I assume it's not full of children. It's a short bus. That is just not what I asked. Is our brand new, feastable bar,
new flavor, new branding. - You want to try it, Blake?
- Yeah. I'm using our snack products to distract them from telling them
where to put the bus. Dude, honestly, this is better
than all the other ones. - All the other ones.
- I promise. Anyone want a piece of chocolate? Did you get that? Hey Blake! 5 minutes till boom. I need 10 more minutes.
Just give me five extra minutes. You have four minutes. - Bro, you spraying them with water.
- Probably feels good. I don't think they agree. They're literally
getting off the car. They've got 90 seconds left. Blake, you're running out of time. Go! Go! Come on. Come on. Hey! It’s five o’clock. Stop, stop, stop,
turn it off, turn it off. Hey, hey, Blake.
Turn it off before I start taking your money. Let's go over to the bunker. You narrowly escaped death
from the tanks. Let's see if you can do it again. Let the sun go down
so it's a little darker now. This is the biggest bomb
we’ve ever set off. This is the first bomb I’ve ever seen. Blake, are you nervous? Yeah, I'm sweating now. This is the detonation device. Here
you go. It's live? Yes, it's live. Two days of work, 17
cars, six water jugs for shipping containers
and $500,000 on the line. Let's find out if you're going to be
rich or go home with nothing. When you're ready, Blake. Three, two, one. Mom, I love you. Oh my gosh. That firestorm is massive. - Can we go put that out?
- Before we go put it out. I'm just wasting time. Run! Grab the fire extinguisher! Go, go, go, go. Let’s go see if it burns! Oh, no. Oh, it's on fire over there. Oh, no. Be careful of this. Get off my money. The fire still going on up front. Blake is moving sandbags. Right there should be good. Please don't be ashes. Please don't be ashes. What do you see? What do you see? - I see green!
- Oh, my gosh. Yeah, baby!
Yeah! I see a lot of dirt on it,
but it seems it survived. Whoa. I knew it. Blake, you've officially completed
phase two of four. Do you want to see
what the next challenge is? Yes. All right, Blake, for your third
challenge, we're going to be dropping
flaming cars filled with gasoline on top of your money. Can you tell me how many cars? - A lot.
- A lot? A lot. This is going to be the hardest
phase yet. Not only will Blake have to deflect
the attack from the sky, but he'll also have to protect his
money from the flammable gasoline seeping through the cracks
of his defense. And after we drop the cars,
I have another surprise. Good luck. I want the crate with the money
in it to be stuffed with concrete, that shipping container
that's just sitting. Plop that on top of the money. Since Blake had been working so hard for the past few days,
he ended up going right to sleep and saved most of his work
the next day. And although he seemed confident,
this challenge would soon prove itself
to be more difficult than anything
he's ever faced in these videos. - Let’s go Blake!
- Come on, Blake! Alright, this is day four. I'm feeling like a zombie. We're going to take the other
shipping container that I have. We're going to pick that up
and we're going to put it in a formation to where the point is
facing up, so it’s like a pyramid. The cars will hit it, doom and fall, but
not on the money. We've got to get that shipping container
on top as soon as possible. It’s starting to worry me a
little bit. Over the next few hours. Blake did everything in his power to place the top shipping container
at an angle to deflect the cars, even if that meant using wooden logs
to prop it up. If this container does not go
exactly where I want to right now, I'm probably losing a lot of money. We did it. Oh, that makes me feel really good. The water tank,
we bring that over to, like, right
here, fill that thing with bricks, and then we're going
to take the last car we got. Put it right here. That's going to block
all this is going to look great. We got a plan, baby. But what Blake didn't know is
I was about to introduce a twist. Do you want to know what the twist
is? - Yeah.
- Follow me. See that flag over there?
That's a catapult. So as cars fall from the top,
giant flaming balls are going to be hurled
from the side. Dude, I’ve been guessing millions
of things I never thought catapult. I have, like, no more materials.
I have nothing else to use. Throughout the final hour,
Blake raced to cover the weak spots of his fortress. However, there was still a key
part missing. His water truck, which he sent to refill in
the morning, was painfully late. He has 90 seconds left. Alright, here we go. As always it comes down to the wire
with Blake. 60, 59, 58, 54, He's
drenching everything in water before he drop the car to try
to protect the money from the fire. 30 seconds remain. You really think this is going
to stop the fire? Oh, yeah, baby. Three, two, one. Drop it. Just for that. I'm not showing mercy
on the last one. - You knew that was going to happen, dude.
- That was intentional. Oh man, moment of truth. Look how high up that bad boy is. This is only the first of five
flaming cars. We're going to be dropping. On top of the five flaming death balls
from the catapult. - You ready? Blake?
- Get this going, dude. Light it on fire! Now drop it. Oh, no. Oh my Gosh! Hold on. Everything is actually setting
on fire right now. The burning car successfully
rolled off the container. However, the wood
that Blake used to prop it up quickly engulfed in flames. Dude, what's going on? What is happening? What in there is on fire, Blake? I don't. I don't even know what to say. What was on top
of the shipping container? All right, there is wood there. Let’s not jinx it. Knock on wood. You put wood? And you knew we are
dropping flaming cars? I needed to use them, dude. Luckily, Blake did surround his money
with cinderblocks, so there's still a very high
likelihood his money is unburned. And since we're about to go
into the coolest part of this video, obviously now I'm going to tell you
about ACORNS. Their debit card is meant to help you grow your money,
not just spend it, which I'll tell you
more about in a second, fire! ACORNS just launched
the new Mighty Oak debit card. They made with Dwayne Johnson Cool thing about this
debit card is every time you make a purchase, it automatically rounds up to the nearest dollar
and invest the difference for you. Believe it or not, your money
is also under attack, not by flaming death balls, but by things like
bills, spending and inflation. Which is why
when you're not spending your money, you'll be hard at work in two of the highest APYs
available. Chandler, what does APYs mean? It means you can fight back against
bills and inflation by growing your money,
 just by having it in your account. Blake, how are you doing, buddy? I'm remembering what it feels like
to lose one of these things. Oh, it's a direct hit. Right on the money. Just from signing
up, ACORNS and I are giving you $20 to start growing your money. So go to acorns.com/mrbeast To learn about how you can
make your money work for you. Light it on fire! Drop it. The rain of fire
continued all throughout the night. Oh, oh. And as the flames only grew bigger,
things started to look really bleak for Blake's money. No, no, no. That fire was raging for over
an hour and a half. It's either all going to be there
or it's not going to be there at all. That right there is a bunch
of logs of wood. He accidentally created
a giant bonfire. He thought he was making a fortress, but he was actually
making a furnace. I mean, there's still a chance
the concrete protected the money. Blake, moment of truth.
Did your cinderblocks protect your money
or was the fire just too much? Oh, my God. Oh, no. Oh. Oh, Those are ruined. Wait, hold up. The money is
fried. It's a thousand degrees in there. Let’s be real with ourselves, Blake. It's gone. As you saw,
most of the money looks like this. Another loss. Yeah. This one hurts
more than the laser one. What hurts the most is that I worked
so hard for nothing. Yeah, it sucks. The challenge is officially over. And before you go, Blake,
I have an offer for you. You have two choices. You can either walk away with
$100,000, or you could get a third and final chance
to compete in a future video. - All right, I'm coming back.
- You're coming back? I'm coming back. Okay. Blake's last chance to win a video is going to be right here,
but it won't be out until February. I don't think me, the audience. Everyone can bear to see
you lose a third time. I'll see you then."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_CbgLpvH9E,I Spent 7 Days In Solitary Confinement,1216,20231230,en,"I'm going to attempt to spend the next seven days
in solitary confinement. - Seal me up.
- Bye Jimmy. Hopefully I don't go insane. For the next seven days. I have to survive in this soundproof white room with zero human contact
and zero stimulation. And because this is actually
psychologically dangerous, the most important thing
is the doctor outside making sure I don't go insane. I worked in psych hospitals for 23
years, and this is much worse than anything I've ever seen. Anything past 50 hours
in a white room like this. Can lead to permanent
psychological damage. And I'm about to do 168 hours. There is a chance that
I actually start to lose my mind and go into something
called psychosis. And they have to pull me out
because it can cause permanent damage to me. He survived
seven days, buried alive. - Is this much harder?
- Much harder. He doesn't have social contact. If your brain doesn't have information coming
in, it generates craziness. It generates hallucinations, it
generates paranoia. And all I have to survive for
the next week is a bed to sleep on, a notebook with a pen,
a refillable bottle, water, toothbrush with toothpaste
and a bar of soap, a toilet to use the bathroom
and a sink for water. At this point, it was clear to me
it was going to be difficult to entertain myself
during this challenge. Especially on hour nine
when I did this. You're probably wondering
how many tiles are on these walls. The correct answer is 1900. And if you want the roof and floor
included, then it's 2860. But more importantly
than all of that, according to my stomach,
it is time to eat food. So if you're wondering how I'm
eating during this challenge. There's a conveyor belt here
which spans over 100 feet so I can be fed
without any human interaction. I think I've been in here around
14 hours. Isn't it crazy that at this point
I was already off by 2 hours? And so far the hardest part of the
challenge is no one's fed me yet. In hindsight,
I should've ate more food. Before I came in here. Yeah, it would be really nice if
someone fed me sometime soon. Your boy is very hungry. - Did you wash your hands? 
- Yeah, of course I did. Oh, he did not. We'll be sending him
his meals randomly so he can't guess the time. Like it's 6 p.m. right now, and we're sending him his breakfast. When are my friends
going to feed me? I am hungry. I am hungry. Now because this room is soundproof. Even though the food arrived,
I didn't realize it until I checked 2 hours later. Too hungry to walk. That's a little dramatic man, 
come on. So when I finally checked. Oh, I was not actually expecting
food. This tastes awesome. It's cold and soggy, and I'm
just so deprived of feeling things. This is great. This solitary confinement set is
literally wrapped in metal chains. If this set caught on fire. I would probably burn alive
before they can unlock it. Anyways, I'm going to think about
other things than that. For the next few hours. I try to keep myself as stimulated
as humanly possible. Wow, that's kind of cool. He's got nothing.
He has nothing to work with. If he's already resulting to this
for basic stimulation, I have my doubts that he'll last
seven days. It's interesting how when you 
take everything away from a man, something as simple as a metal plate can be like as fun as an iPhone. He's going
to get agitated by way of boredom. This is a very dehumanizing
experience. I'm just going to go to bed
and we'll see what happens. I think I'm around 40 hours
into the challenge. Jimmy's 6 hours off on what time
he thinks it is. Which means it's around 4 p.m. on day number two. I thought he'd be on track today. Losing my sense of time
led to other problems. No matter what I do,
I literally just can't sleep. These lights are just really messing
with my brain. Maybe I'll just lay here
for the next five days. The reason he has insomnia is
he doesn't need to sleep. He wants to sleep this off
and just get it over with. But what he should be doing
is trying to do something that is going to occupy
his attention while he's awake. He's climbing the wall. It's the natural human urge
for freedom. He's regressing to primal instinct. Why did I think it was 4pm? Shouldn't that mean it's 9pm? And by the time I had gotten around to eating my first meal,
it was 4:30 in the afternoon. Don't get me wrong, the food looks
good, but it is freezing cold. I'd rather starved and
eat the rest of this. So... And when my second meal had arrived, I felt like only minutes had passed. What just came through the conveyor
belt? Wait. How long has it been? Am I supposed to eat both or... It definitely was day two
when I got the second breakfast, but I didn't eat much of the
breakfast, so maybe they felt bad because I didn't
eat much of the breakfast. Well, no... At this point, I had no idea how long that first meal was sitting
in the conveyor belt for. Did you see he's getting a little paranoid? That's the thing that can get worse
as time goes on. It's only day two. I'm not sure what to do. I think I'm going to just see
how high I can count. One, two, three, four. It looks crazy, right? 565, 566, 567 When you're in a situation
where there's nothing to do 999. What's crazy is to just succumb to it. 1,000. As this progresses, he's going
to run out of random things to do. And I got to give it to him.
The doctor was right. Because later in this challenge
I borderline go insane. Do you think I'd get it? Do you think I'd? And while my strategy to sleep
through most of the challenge did help pass the time, it ended up
hurting me in other ways. I see food over there. It's freakin soggy and cold. How long has this been sitting here? This food's been sitting there
for 7 hours. I would have given anything to eat
that ice cream. It would have been nice
to have edible parts of the meal. Well,
I guess I'll just be hungry again. Normally, because we're working on
so many videos at once, I'm usually, like, incredibly stressed. As of right now, I don't really feel that stressed
at all, but I feel a ton of anxiety because I have this severe FOMO
that I'm missing tons of cool stuff going on in the world. It's weird. It's a different emotion
than I'm used to. It's pretty crazy
how hard it is to do nothing. I'm starting to get really bored This is getting very hard on me
mentally. I'm bored. Help. I was nowhere near the 168
hour mark, so by hour 65,
I started to wonder. How do you do a handstand? I wish before I came in here, I had someone teach me the basics
of how to do a handstand. He's going to have to invent
concepts that only exist in his mind to keep himself from experiencing
intense depression. I'm just going to envision
that I'm currently walking in a park. There's green grass, 
someone's fishing. He's literally making up scenarios
in his head right now. Oh my God. All in all, it's very sunny. I hear birds. You've ruined my walk in the park. Oh my God. We're watching him slip into madness. They gave me more food. But it looks like we got some rice,
sweet potato and steak. This is the best meal I've gotten
so far this challenge. If you look right here,
you'll see some rice, and any ordinary human
would probably eat this rice. But I'm going to count it
13, 14, 15, 16, 17 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 265, 266, 267, 307, 308, 309, 310, 421, 422, 423, 424. 445, 446, 447. There are 447 grains of rice
on this metal tray. This information probably profoundly
changed you as a human. I'm feeling pretty tired, which means it's
probably the night of the fifth. I wasn't even halfway through the challenge
and was already off a full day. I'm going to get some more Zs in the
bathroom where it's not so freaking bright, which proved to be
my smartest move yet because I actually slept
in that bathroom for 12 hours. We're officially halfway
into the challenge. - 84 hours.
- Jimmy is. And we're going to tell that
in his next meal. Just kind of mix it all up for him. I mean, he could still
put the letters together. I am hungy. Hungy I am. What are we working with here? What is this? Bro's never heard
of SpaghettiOs? And that wasn't the only thing
I was forgetting the name of. What is this called? This is a... ...a roll. This is a lot of sauce for one roll. Kind of tastes like ketchup. How does he not notice
the letters in there? That's an N. - Yeah!
- Yeah! You guys forgot to take these
four SpaghettiOs out. No! Every time he finds a letter,
he just keeps eating it. I hope those weren't
supposed to spell something. That I was magically supposed
to realize that before I ate them and then put it together
to figure out a word for more food. Surely that's not what they wanted
for me. Jimmy's about to watch this when
he gets out and feel so dumb. Depression. At this point, the bright lights
were really starting to get me. I have a ginormous headache right now,
and I am so hungry. What is going on to my body? Well, he did ask for more food
even though he is getting all the calories he needs. But the reason for that
is that he's so under stimulated, he thinks he's starving. I ended up checking for food
over and over and over again. This is oddly soothing. Do you think I'd get a concussion
from doing this? You should probably stop.
You're right. I should probably stop. There's a bag of McDonald's here. It's suspiciously light. If there is not McDonald's in this
bag, I'm going to be depressed. There actually is. Let's go. Every time I get a meal, it's like
20 minutes of just pure happiness. I feel human again. I can't stop smiling. I'm so happy. And then the second I finish it, I feel a wave of depression
because I'm like, What do I do now? The seconds are starting
to blend together, so much. I would try to guess what time
it is, but I have no earthly idea. My mind is slowly deforming
into stupidity. I need to occupy myself better. We're going to grab this McDonald's
cheeseburger wrapper, as well as this cup
that was holding my toothbrush. And now we have basketball. LeBron, Steph, Kobe,
maybe basketball's not my thing. I think I was always better
at baseball. They're like, Strike! That was not what was supposed to happen. And then I remembered... Oh, there's a fork on it. That I had an indestructible plate
from my very first meal. I am going to throw this so far, it is hilarious. I'm bored. I still have two days left inside
this room and I have a feeling at some point
I'm going to want to leave. It's day four. No matter how much 
I beg, or scream, or plead... Or burp. Do not let me out of this room
early. Okay, Jimmy,
I got you. My instincts tell me 
I was so far done 113 hours, which means
I have 55 hours remaining. And whoever's editing this,
show them how many hours
I actually have remaining. Hopefully
in somewhere close to 55 hours. I think he's going to get angry
and possibly paranoid about what's going on. Is a man not allowed to have privacy? There's a camera there.
There's a camera above that. There's a camera. A camera, a camera, camera,
camera, camera, camera. There's
so many cameras on me 24/7. I'm going to go insane. What if we throw the camera
through the conveyor... Genius. I'll treat it like bowling. Somehow I hit my finger. I severely underestimated
how hard this video would be. Just thinking about
it has me like tearing up, but I kind of feel like an animal
right now. Like, I feel like I lost
all my rights as a human. If I had to guess, I would say
I'm halfway through day five. I really miss my girlfriend
and I miss the gang as well. Even Nolan. Even Nolan. Mentally right now I'd say I'm
at like literal rock bottom. Like, this is very inhumane. I've been in here so long
that some of my dreams are about me in this room, and
I think it's like day six or seven. But then I wake up
and realize it was a dream. What time is it? I would pay so much money 
to know what freaking time it is. Let's go over why I think there
are 33 hours left in this challenge. I've slept five times. Reason number two, 
I usually poop once a day, and I've also pooped five times
since I got here. Reason number three, I've grown a lot of hair
on my neck here, and this usually does
take like a week. If for some reason... If for some
reason it's still day five Or God forbid, it's somehow
still day four, I will lose my mind. While I was sleeping,
I had a dream about that one time that I counted to 100,000. And so when I woke up, I decided to do a thousand laps
around this room. You know, for old times sake. That'll be the marker. 1, 2, 3. Watching back this footage,
it's literally crazy. I resorted to walking in circles
to keep myself sane. A thousand is way too many. I'm already starting to get dizzy. This entire challenge. I've been getting water out of this
sink and I'm going to be honest. this uh… this is… it… I'm not... Bro. Cirkul is a flavor cartridge you can screw on your water bottle
and makes bland water taste amazing. There's over 100 different flavors
that fit this bottle that are all zero calories
and zero sugar. Moving this tripod is miserable. Choose
how intense you want the flavor and then start drinking away. It honestly adds so much flavor
I can't even tell it's sink water. I've been drinking fruit punch
throughout this entire challenge and it actually makes the water
taste amazing. I'm going to walk back and forth
between these walls. These cartridges also last for
multiple refills of your water bottle, which is good because the boys suck
at sending these. Sometimes I got to use the same one
for a whole day. If you want to start
drinking more water or just want your water
to start tasting good in general,
go to drinkcirkul.com or your local
Walmart to give it a try. I've tried everything to keep myself entertained
and I'm going to be honest. It's not working. And after I finished all my Cirkuls, Karl brought back to people
from 100 days trapped together. We're here. Hey, check it out. 
You guys are going to love this. That's the faces of the guy
that trapped you guys for 100 days. Would you say this is easier or
harder than what you guys did? In comparison, I think I'd rather have like
someone else in it with me. And now that the tables had turned
and I was the one in the white cube, Bailey
and Suzie plotted their revenge. I'll show you guys
how the conveyor belt works. They sent an empty tray. He's about to freak out. I don't feel bad at all. This is what he gets. I bet every dollar in my bank
account Karl just showed up. No way! You hungry, Jimmy? Eat this! No, we're not doing this.
We are not doing this. We're not doing it. This is the most stimulation
he's had in days. Well, you got to
give them credit. I probably deserve that. Imagine this
is what happens after you die. You just go to a white room
like this forever. That would be miserable. When I sleep. I dream of me in the outside world. And when I'm awake, I'm
just depressed and lonely and to be honest, miserable. So the more time I spend sleeping,
the happier I am. Let me out. I'm Batman. I feel dead. I really need to get out of here. We did seven days on a raft,
I did seven days buried alive. And now seven days
and solitary confinement. If I had known how hard this would
be, I never would have done this. If that hour number in the top left
says anything higher than 20, I'm going to lose my mind. I am feeling extremely lonely. I miss my girlfriend. This is torture. Is he crying? He's not doing well. He's just like napping on the floor,
throwing things, having tantrums, getting happy when he gets snacks,
he's like a child. I think there's 8 hours left and then they're going
to open that door right there. And I am free. I hope. I pray. Please be 8 hours. He thinks he's sleeping through
the last couple of hours right now. That's what he thinks this is. So it's going to be a rude
awakening, literally. To be honest it's concerning. I give it maybe another 2 to 3 hours
and that door opens. I'm going to enjoy my last meal, 
and then we're getting out of here. - Did he just say it's his last meal?
- I think so. Well, that's ironic because it's
literally exactly 24 hours. Any hour now, they're going
to be walking through that door. So I'm going to clean up
the place. It's a little messy. You know, I was trying to make up
an excuse to clean, but in reality, I'm just bored. I thought coming into this experiment,
I would get more mental clarity, maybe
learn a little bit about myself. But in reality, all I'm walking away
with is the newfound skill of being able to throw things out
a conveyor belt door. Or maybe not. There is just no world where there's
more than 24 hours left. I can't do another 24 hours in here. I've had my limit,
but it doesn't matter. There's just not 24 hours left. I just don't. I refuse to believe that. So any second now, any second now, any second now. To pass the time, 
I'm going to resume counting. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 20, 21, 22. 5422, 5423, 5424, 5425. I swear to God
I heard something out there. I'm sad. I'm sad. I am sad. I am sad. I don't want to be here. Get me out of this room. I don't want to be here. This is barely human. He's lying in bed, covering his eyes. No excitement. This is totally
not what you want to see. How is he going to act? It's
going to be a new human. I'm worried he's going to be
this human. He's just collapsed
into dysfunction. We've never pushed him
as far as he is pushed in this video. Well because he's been totally deprived
of any human contact. Be gentle, like a little kid
waking up from a nap. Well, there's 10 minutes left,
so let's go get ready. - Thank you. 
- Good luck. I'm going to die. Ten, nine, eight. Seven, six, five, four... Hold on. 
Wait, I don't even have pants on. Three, two, one. Oh, my gosh. Hey, Jimmy. Sorry,
I was just putting my pants on. It's not as bright out here. How is it, dude? I'm actually kind of lightheaded. You know, it's crazy, 
but after this challenge I kind of forgot how to interact
with humans. Where he’s going? It's actually relieving to not stare at a bright light. It's like the ceiling is awesome. This is the happiest 
I've seen you in a long time. Honestly, I thought I was perpetually
just going to be 24 hours forever. Follow me outside. I want to see the sun. Oh, my God. It's dark out. So nice to see the
outside world."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOKASgtr6kU,I Adopted 100 Dogs!,902,20231223,en,"In this video, we're going to help over 100 different stray dogs
finding a loving home. Something
all of these dogs have in common is that they were abandoned
or rescued from kill shelters. Some of them
would have even been dead by the time this video was uploaded, which is why we brought all of them
here to this massive dog sanctuary to get every one of them adopted. And to show you
how serious we're taking this video. We have an army of trainers, walkers
and even an entire team dedicated to giving the dogs scratches. Make sure they get lots of love. I want the doggos happy. And the doggos were happy, especially once the first
adopter showed up. Welcome. Come on in. What? You're going to adopt a dog
even though you already have one? Yes, we want a small dog
to be friends with this guy. And if you're wondering where these two random
people came from, we spent hundreds of thousands of
dollars on a statewide ad campaign to get
as many people here as possible. - What do you think of Biscuit?
- Oh, she's cute. If you're interested,
we can take them to the park and let them play together. Yes, that would be amazing. - Oh, they're running together. 
- Yes. We love her. You want to proceed
to the next step? Yes, please. We love her so much. One down, 99 More to go.
Oh, we got a runaway dog. We got you cornered. They're all cheering him
on. All right. Whoever adopts Rocky,
good luck, he's very energetic. And something you should know. Every person
who wants to adopt a dog. Hi baby! - All right you're free, Barkley.
- Oh, he's great. I think we're going to do it. Is first put through extensive 
background checks by an independent third party person. To make sure they'll be able to
provide a safe, stable and loving home. - Barkley's been officially adopted.
- Thank you! Congratulations. And when the
next family came in. Let's go find you guys a dog. They notice a dog right away. Oh, look at this. He's ready. How many dogs? As many as you can carry, baby. Charlie and Nugget. They're getting along so well. And after saying goodbye
to Nugget and Charlie, things began to pick up. Hi! I'm Karl, you want to meet a dog
instead of me? Yeah, that's kind of
why I'm here. Chandler, nice to meet you. How's it going? 
I'm Jimmy. Hi. You strike me as someone 
who'd like Brownie. He's cute. It's the end of day
one and eight dogs got adopted. But obviously, the cute, 
fluffy dogs are easier to find homes for. Getting all 100 dogs adopted
could literally take months, but at least on day two. Thanks to our ad campaign,
we had ten times the people waiting. Oh my God. Here's a
cute puppy you got to play with it? Oh my gosh. The objective is to hit them with
a cute puppy when they walk in the door. Seems to be working. - I like this one.
- I love you. - You want to take Hansel?
- Let's do that. There's so many people in here. I don't know what to do. Oh my God! - I'm taking the dog home.
- Okay. There we go. 
Another one adopted. In case you're wondering,
these Xs don't mean the dog's died. It means they got adopted. I want both! See if you can convince them
to adopt two dogs. There is a buy one,
get one free rule. - They're both free.
- They're both free, actually. Let's get these two. I think you are the one for me baby. We rolling, Rocky out. Chandler is introducing people to dogs. Karl's hanging out 
with the people in the park to make sure they don't
steal the dogs. And Nolan is the closer
and making sure they adopt the dogs. Plus, we have, like, 50 other people
running around doing everything in their power
to find these dogs homes. We have a well-oiled machine running
and we will get all these dogs to a loving home. And on top of that, every adopter
gets an additional surprise. So are you guys certain
you want to adopt Thor? - Yeah. 
- Pretty much. Then I have a surprise for you. Every dog that gets adopted, they also come with free
pet food for life. I should probably turn this with
you can see it. Free pet food for life
and pet insurance for life. Get out. I think I'm going to cry. Do we get food for life? That does not
come with human food for life. Thanks to Spot and Jinx,
we are able to provide premium pet food and insurance
for all 100 dogs. Let's go! Thank you! Which literally means free dog food shows up at their door
for the entire life of the dog. Oh, my God. Look at that. Thank you! What kind of angel is doing this? It's my friend Jimmy. Well, tell your friend Jimmy thank you. But that was when I met
this woman who really stood out, having previously adopted
six other dogs in her lifetime. And so we took her to see some dogs,
but she fell in love with Zoey right away. That's her, Dane. And she's going to meet Zoey
for the first time. Let's see if they get along well. The butt sniffs. 
That's a good sign. We need you to be extra nice to Zoey.
Okay? Look at them running around. Zoey is going to be extra
happy in this new home. And because now with Zoe, she'll be
caring for a total of seven dogs. How awesome. We wanted to surprise her
with something a little extra. We're also going to give you $10,000
in cash. Get out. As long as you promise
to give her lots of scratches. I do that for nothing. Now you're doing it
for ten grand. - No way.
- No problem. I rescued so many babies. Because I just love them.
And they deserve a good home. Yeah, absolutely. You're going to give her
a great home, we know that. And even though it was a chaotic day, by the end of day two,
we had 44 dogs adopted. But we noticed there was one dog who got passed up by families more than any other that day. This dog's name is Buffet He only has three legs
because sadly, he was hit by a car, which unfortunately means he may just be the hardest dog
out of 100 to find a home for. So this is my favorite dog
over here. His name is Buffett. He only has three legs. But luckily for Buffett, we had a few new strategies for tomorrow
because on day three we still had over 50 dogs to get adopted. So the first strategy we used was I let everyone into the park
and unleash all of the dogs so that they can choose their own family. You got a camera
and you're the camera man. So beautiful! Have you decided on the baby's name? We think Hershey. Hershey? Good dog name, 
bad chocolate name. Yeah, you can just jump in there. We won't lock you in. All right. You can't leave
until you adopt her now. So what do you say?
You want to get the leash? - Yeah, why not? 
- All right, arms up. - I'm just kidding.
- It's a perfect match. - You think this might be the one?
- Think so. You want to go home with me?
She's too cute. And since we were getting
pretty good at adopting dogs, it was time to have
a little bit of fun. Boys, what am I doing? Lay down and pretend to be asleep
whenever they... Oh, she just came in. Hi. Stay asleep, hold it. - Is he asleep?
- Yeah, he's taking a nap. He just tucked him in. Now get up and say 
""guess nap time's over"". Guess nap time's over. And now go back to sleep. Bro they think he's crazy. Look at her face. But all jokes aside,
the good news is we were finally getting more people
to see Buffet. Oh, he likes you guys. Buffett might be about to find a family. But unfortunately. Are you thinking Tanner or Buffett? We need to get Tanner. Do you want to take Buffet back? Yeah, I think so. And we'll go take a look 
at a couple more. Ok. So we try it again with these two. He's a sweetheart, and
he actually gets around really well. But once again. So you don't want Buffet. - I can't take him. 
- Yeah, come on good boy. And to be honest, guys, 
this whole situation made us really sad,
which is why we spent 50 grand on a customized buffet
marketing campaign. We will not rest
until Buffet has a loving home. As you can see,
almost all the puppies are gone because people are just not looking
to adopt older dogs as much. And since that's all we have left, the further we go, the harder
this gets. Some of these dogs are from a facility
called a kill shelter because they're unable to refuse
any animals. They're often overcapacity and have to put down their dogs
to make space for more. But fortunately,
that's not going to happen. And up next, we're on day number four. And this time we have Dave Bautista, who you might recognize
from Guardians of the Galaxy. Thank you. This one's your favorite. She's so loving. She's working her magic. Don't give me that look. She's like,
Come on, why don't you adopt me? - You're usually the adopter. 
- Yeah. I have four.
All rescues. Might be five soon. Yeah. Look at us, we both
look super defined. With everyone's dogs picked out. It was time for Dave's
official initiation. This time Dave's doing the adoption. Let's see how good of an actor
he is. Dave, when they walked in, bark
and woof to them as a dog. It's an everyday thing for me. Oh, it's kids. Hello. How are you? All right, you can stop. You can stop. I don't want to make it
too hard on him. Sorry for barking.
I've been speaking to dogs all day. And we have a prize for you. We have a huge prize for you guys, Free pet food for life, from Jinx. And we also have pet insurance
for life, for your dog. Oh, wow. 
That's amazing. But wait, there's actually
one more surprise. There's actually one more surprise. And then go to the beach painting, turn it around and show them what
it says on the back. Do we get the picture? I hate Guardians of the Galaxy. No way. Thanks guys. With Dave now part of the team,
we were adopting dogs faster than ever before. How's it going? Oh, they're so cute. - Are you taking both of them?
- Yeah. You can't separate. - Let's go get the paperwork ready.
- Let's do it. And soon enough, we were approaching the final ten
and hardest to get adopted Dogs. Hi baby!
Yeah. Dave, you keep coming back to her.
What's going on? I have a dog named Penny,
and she reminds me of her so much. So it's already
feeling like we're connected. I hate seeing her without a home.
It's killing me. If no one takes her
home, I'll take her. - If one adopts her, you'll take her?
- I'll adopt her. Yeah. I'm going to hold you to that. She's going to have a home
no matter what. And it wasn't just Doralee. After getting passed up again
and again, by families all day, Buffett seemed like
he was starting to lose hope. But then something unexpected
happened. Buffett seems pretty cool. My grandpa had
a three legged dog. - Can I take him for a walk?
- Yeah. Buffett seemed to warm up
to this guy right away. - Come on hop-along.
- Someone might adopt Buffett. Buffett
had a lot of fun running around, and this guy didn't seem phased
by his missing leg at all. So I've seen three legged dogs
do pretty good. I'm feeling
really good about this time. I think Buffett
is about to find a new home. You want to go home with Buffett? Yeah. He seems like good dog. And to ensure that Buffett has the best possible
quality of life moving forward, we also had a custom
prosthetic leg made for him and were able
to give his adopter $10,000. Buffett found a home. Now we got to get rid of his kennel. Buffett, we miss you already. It's bittersweet, but it feels good
to finally take down his kennel. We'll miss you, Buffett. It is now the start of day five. Only ten doggos remain. We've made
some very serious progress. As there's less dogs, there's less
options for people to choose from. So obviously this is just
going to get harder. And to kick off today
I brought two of my friends. Who are looking to adopt dogs. You might know Neil because he lost
$1,000,000 in our videos. You might know Dustin because
he lost $10,000 like five years ago. It's a lot better than a million. And while you're looking for dogs,
because I've spent over $2 million on getting dogs adopted, don't plan
on slowing down anytime soon. Please. For the love of God,
can I tell you about Surfshark? - Of course.
- I'd rather look at the dogs. Surfshark is a private network provider. VPN, that lets you access content
not available in your location as well as browse the web safely
and securely. Surfshark was also kind enough to give this shelter $50,000
to help save more dogs. So you should watch this ad. What do you think of Cocoa? - I think... 
- Here, tell me in one second. Sometimes content is only available
in a specific country. Luckily, Surfshark has 3000 servers
in 100 different countries, so you can watch movies or shows
that aren't specifically available in yours. - Anyways, what would you saying?
- Tell me more about the VPN. I already did. - You want to take Jet out for a walk?
- Please. Yeah. Let's do it. And with Surfshark's alternative ID, you can disguise things like your address, email
and phone numbers from hackers. You're free. - I'll look at them running. 
- Oh, my goodness. What's the verdict? I love playing with this dog and I want to keep
playing with this dog forever. Good enough for me.
You think you're going to get Jett? I'm absolutely getting Zeus. Oh, his name Zeus now?
Good enough for me. Did you know if they use discount
code MrBeast on Surfshark,
they can get up to 83% off and have six months
added to their subscription. Are you kidding me? On top of that,
Surfshark has a 30 day money back guarantee,
so there's literally no reason not to install
and give it a try right now. You're stupid
if you don't. Neil, don't worry. You don't have
to share checks with him because we have our own checks for you. Let's go! Eight dogs remained and 
we're going to go find them a home. Jimmy, how do I cash these? As we had hoped, 
as more and more people came in, some were showing interest
in our older dogs. Is Dexter a shepherd? Were you interested in a shepherd? Yes. That is exactly
what I was interested in. We got two boys,
so I think we need like a girl. She's ready to come out. Hello pretty girl. So you made up your mind
about Dexter? - You're taking him home? 
- Oh, yeah, I'm taking Dexter. I think we need her in our life. They're so happy. And so as we remove some of the final dog's kennels,
we started to receive video footage from all of the families
who had adopted these dogs so far. And she's loving her new life here. Cooper has been
a great addition to our family. This is Hazel so far. She is doing amazing. Hi Sarah. You got belly rubbed. Good boy.
Yes. Thank you for the puppies MrBeast. And it was really beautiful. At the start of this video,
we had 100 dogs that have been left in kill shelters or abandoned,
but now only two remain, leaving us
with Star Crunch and Doralee. And while people are
coming to adopt, neither dogs seem to fit
what they were looking for. - I was looking for a small dog.
- We don't actually have any small dogs. I was really looking for
like a younger dog. Yeah, no worries. Do you guys have any small dogs? Sadly, we don't have any more. We were starting to worry
that we wouldn't find this two a home and there was nothing left to do
but wait. Star Crunch and Doralee. Oh, How's it going? - What up? 
- Hi. These are our final two. It's like the last pick in dodgeball. I'm going for this one. Star Crunch can be incredibly shy
when she meets new people, but Star Crunch gravitated right to him. - We'll call you Crunch.
- Win him over crunch. You're watching all these dogs
get adopted. - No. 
- Doralee. And even though it was exciting
to watch Crunch get adopted, it was still sad to see Doralee
all by herself. Oh, my God. 
She's actually sad. She's just realized what happened. And now we have one. And we're going to give
whoever adopts Doralee over there an even bigger surprise
than everyone else. And since she's the only dog left,
she doesn't need a kennel. This entire building is her kennel. She's so fast. We made sure to give Doralee all
the attention the last dog deserved. As we waited and waited and waited
until finally one person walked in. - How's it going, man? 
- This is Doralee. Hey. - Oh, she seems to like you. 
- So pretty, yeah. She was saved after being abandoned
during hurricane Idalia and now she's just
looking for a forever home. I think she just found one. But before you can take Doralee home, one person has to approve of it. I hate seeing her here. If no one takes her
home, I'll take her. How's it going? I need you to give your blessing,
okay? She looks super happy. Oh, yeah. Approved! I'm going to give him
the paperwork, take care. Congratulations. Oh, I just hung up on Dave. He is way too big
for you to do that. Congratulations on adopting Doralee. And as a reward for adopting the 100th dog,
we have $20,000 in cash for you. Are you serious? You have to promise us,
you will always take care of her. Right here. I have one final surprise for the people that helped us
get all these dogs adopted. Come on in. As a thank you for
letting us use your place. We wanted to make
a $100,000 donation. So you can keep finding abandoned
dogs homes. We also brought a bunch of money for all of you that helped us
get them adopted. Thank you Spot and Jinx for
providing pet insurance and dog food. That was wonderful. There's about 50 grand 
in those wheelbarrows, which is extra on top of what
they made when we paid them to help. Thank you for watching."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RhWXPcKBI8,"Survive 100 Days Trapped, Win $500,000",1627,20231216,en,"I've built a massive
isolation chamber and we're going to see
if these two strangers can survive in this cube
for the next 100 days. They have never met each other ever. Bailey. This is Suzie. - Suzie, this is Bailey.
- Nice to meet you. Hi! Nice to meet you. If the two of you can survive
the next 100 days in here. I will give you the half a million
dollars inside of this vault. But if one of you leaves before the 100
days is up, you both get nothing. All right. I think you
guys understand the rules. - Have fun.
- Okay. Bye. This is going to be crazy. Yeah. This is actually like an insane
asylum. They're currently looking at all
the stuff we put in there. We gave them enough food
for 100 days, which is healthy,
but basically the exact same thing over and over again. We also gave them their own private bathroom,
which comes with the shower and obviously has no cameras inside
and a bed to sleep on. They have everything
they need to survive 100 days. It's just a question of do
they want it? I got a comb. I don't know if
I've ever combed my hair in my life. Interesting. See how they're both standing
on different sides of the room? They're so awkward. When I had them
take their blindfolds off. That was legitimately
the first time they had ever met. I just keep thinking of the feeling
like of exiting. Oh, yeah? How good is that going to feel? It's only a 100 sleeps. Only 100 sleeps. And then the world will have just
kept going. That's like, what freaks me out. The most interesting
part of this experiment is that in this room, you have no idea
what day or time it is. And already night one. Suzie and Bailey made the mistake
of only sleeping for 2 hours, which means they started
their second day at 2:37 a.m. I'm just going to just act like
this is just the new normal. - Okay, what do you want to eat?
- Are you feeling beef or chicken? - Chicken.
- Chicken sounds great. That is sickening. It's good. As you can see, living inside
a white cube is pretty boring. Besides eating the same thing over and over, time in the chamber
consisted of two things trying to hide
from the bright light. The lights are just so bright,
that we have to make these things to shield ourselves.  And desperate attempts to keep themselves entertained. Like on day four,
when they use the paper from their journals
to make a deck of playing cards. Is he making... Cards? All right.
So I just finished my deck of cards. I think that they actually
 came out all right. Which honestly looked pretty fun. So I made myself a $30,000 seat
and joined it. On day five,
they made a sign in sheet, which was really just
an elaborate trick. What is it? You have to sign our sign in sheet. Oh, these are our camera people. Yeah, this is everyone
 that's come in today. Wait a minute. You're having them do this so you can track the date
and the time. Hold up, I need to borrow this. No, no, I wrote the date. I wrote the date. Which I got to say was pretty smart. But by the time we got to day seven, anything considered
smart was thrown out the window. Bailey's lost it. He's whipping the pork. Yeah. The veggies never stood a chance. Five more throws. But I only need one. Let's freakin go, baby. It's actually crazy to me
that already on day 9 of this challenge, they're
bored enough to expose the red line that if they cross, they lose
every dollar of their prize money. It is now day number ten. How you doing, Nolan? Good. And I got a pretty
interesting offer. What is it? So it looks like they took
the $500,000 and put 250 on her side and 250 on his to remind themselves
of what's at stake. The whole door
opening thing is so dramatic. How's it going? We're about to reveal the most
interesting part of the challenge. I need you two to just face this wall. They don't even know
that there's a door back here. Let's do this. This is their first time seeing
the outside world in 10 days. You are kidding me. The sky. Every ten days,
I will give you something that will make the challenge easier. But if you actually want it, you have to pay for it
with some of your prize money. And first, for day ten, we're going to give you
the option to buy a private chef that'll cook you
whatever you want between now and the end of the challenge
for $50,000. Before you answer, if you want to give up
some of your prize money, we're gonna let
you have a nice meal. Use this as a floor
for your imagination as to what you could be eating for
90 more days. You are kidding me. 50 grand a lot, though. Okay, let's not think about it
right now. These look like some people
that have only canned chicken for ten days. I love just looking at the sky. You forget that they literally
haven't seen the sun in 10 days. Now I feel bad. After eating this,
the thought of that food is like grossing me out even worse. It's rough. They're starting to talk about
whether they should take it. - I don't know what to do.
- I don't either. This is a good first one to tempt us
with. - Oh, no.
- Hey Jimmy. All right.
It's time for the decision. Would you pay $50,000 to have this
for the rest of the challenge? - Nope.
- I think we decided no. Really? I honestly didn't
think you guys would say no. - Oh, no, no.
- Oh, my God. I have another offer in ten days. We'll see if you cave, then. I really thought
you were going to say yes. - That was crazy.
- Bye.  I'm really curious about
what the next temptation is. I know,
but you know what? I'm proud of us
for staying strong. Good job. And now, with the chef gone, it seemed like Suzie
and Bailey were already starting to regret their decision. Bon appétit. My favorite part is
that you can hold it sideways, And it stays on the plate. The next few days were
pretty mind-numbing for the both of them. Their routine consisted
of waking up, cooking food, and then eventually
just going back to sleep. Man, the longer I'm in here, the more I feel like I'm sharing
a space with an annoying sibling. Are you talking about me? Who else? And even though they were getting
used to each other, one thing they weren't getting used to were
the constant beaming lights. It's just so bright in there. I came in the bathroom because
the light, you can keep it off. So it's nice and like dark in here. Once it gets super late at night,
I physically feel my eyes stinging just because of how bright
the lights are in here and because it was so hard
for them to get any sleep. I had the perfect offer
planned for day 20. Congrats, you're 20% done. Are you two ready for the offer? - Yeah.
- Yes. Your day 20 offer is simple. I will give you each a smart bed
that are super comfortable and combined will cost
$50,000 of your prize money. I will also give you this iPad with the ability
to turn off the lights. Dang. They have exactly one hour
to decide if they want to spend $50,000 of their prize money
for these beds and the ability to turn off the lights. The answer might be yes. I haven't seen Suzie this happy
since we literally started the challenge. Let's remember what we would have
to live with if we don't say yes. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. I think they're going to take it. I think we should. It's only 10% of our money. It's decision
time. Your 1 hour is up. This is what
your eyeballs could have. But if you say no,
this is what you're stuck with for 80 days straight. Do you want this comfortable beds? I'm actually okay with whatever you say. - Five, four.
- Oh, my gosh. - Three.
- I’m happy with whatever you say. - Two, one.
- Bailey, yes or no? Bailey, yes or no? What's your decision? No. Really? Ok... Wow. I did not see that one coming. I think I made a mistake, maybe. Oh, what a heavy mistake. I cannot believe you guys said no. I'll leave you alone
for a couple of days. I hope you don't regret
your decision. - Bye
- Bye. I think we made the right decision. I can't believe that in the heat of the moment
you said no. I feel that slight regret right now. I don't. I feel no regret in your decision. So today I made my calendar,
and I was just writing my mom's birthday. It's going to
be tough on that day, I think. I'm so bored. I think that we're hitting a point where boredom is
like at a all-time high. I woke up this morning
and didn't feel like doing anything, so I just sat there and stared. What are you going to do with this money? I have a house, I was probably
going to pay a lot on the house. Oh, that's awesome. I want to pay off my parents debt. That would be like my ideal world. Throughout the following days, I made sure to not interrupt
the routine. However,
I was also taking note of things they missed from the outside world, like on day 24 when I overheard them
wanting seasoning on their food. Okay, if we add seasoning, I can
easily stay here a hundred days. On day 27, Suzie was craving coffee. I am a big coffee
drinker and I only have water. And on day 28, Bailey clearly needed
entertainment. So by day 30 I had the perfect plan
to get them to spend money. It's now day 30 and
it's time for another offer. - How's it going?
- Hi. Today's offer is simple. Each of these five items
cost $10,000. You can buy one phone call,
the entire Harry Potter collection, your own coffee machine, spices,
salt and pepper for your food. Or you can buy a monopoly
for $10,000. You could buy one of them.
You can buy all five of them. This is tough, actually.
You have 10 minutes to decide. Just let me know what you want. I'm so nervous. - This is a big decision.
- Coffee? - It does sound kind of nice.
- It does. - And then the seasoning.
- Seasoning sounds nice too. I'm doing this one
1,000% I'll be honest with you. I don't really care about that. Sick. Coffee would be nice, as like a treat every morning. I've made my mind up. Decision time. Are you buying Monopoly? - No.
- No. Gone. Are you buying the spices? - No.
- No. Are you buying the coffee? Does it come with cream or sugar? If you say yes in 3 seconds. - Yes.
- Okay. Yay Coffee! Are you buying
the Harry Potter books? Yes. Are you buying the phone calls? - No.
- No. We finally got you two to buy something. This feels good.
It was a pleasure doing business. Thanks for taking your money. Most expensive coffee
maker in the world. 30 days in, we got something
new, that's exciting. We caved. You're welcome. That's my closet. That's my bookshelf. I could stay another 70 days easy. And we still have $480,000 It’s crazy. Over the next few days. Not a lot happened. - She's already preparing a meal.
- It's like being married. The most interesting thing was
when hurricane Idalia
took out the power on day 34. - Oh, no way.
- No way. As you can imagine,
our cameras became pretty useless. So I'm
just going to take you to day 39. How's it going? - Hello?
- Hi. Hey. I know
you guys have been struggling. I'm sorry it took so long. Hold up. Oh there we go. That was a long delay. You should be able to use
your coffee pot again, cook food. You should have a hot shower. That's excellent. I'll see you tomorrow
with the surprise. Oh, I'm so excited. The power's on. Look, it's light. Like it feels like cheerier. The lights are back on again. I just had a hot meal, hot shower. Life is finally looking up here. There's now day 40. - Can I come in?
- Come in. Your gift at no expense is this TV. But every single movie is $10,000
a pop. You have one hour to decide.
Have fun. This is crazy.
The amount of movies in here. We can watch this documentary about Nolan. We left Suzie and Bailey
to discuss the offer and told them we'd be back later,
but they didn't seem too interested. How about ten grand for all? I'll go ahead and tell you now, no. You might as well just come in here,
because I think we both are set in our ways. Okay. The best I could do
is buy one, get one half off. Can't do it. All right gang, come on in. Take every last one. I'll gladly keep this. Not any of the Hunger Games? I left the TV in the chamber
to remind Suzie and Bailey of what they could have had. But little did I know
they were going to outsmart me. An antenna is just a piece of metal. Rip this little wire off the wall. So I had to take this knife
so that the wire is, like, frayed. I literally just plugged it
into the antenna spot. Now we're going to see if it works. Just anything. Give us one channel. What? It says that there's seven digital
channels. Oh, my gosh. If this actually works... Wait. - I'm like actually shaking.
- Bailey! Currently the only thing
that we can get on the TV is a race car race. - Never really been a fan.
- Oh, he's in second. But today, all of a sudden, we're
huge race car fans. Our time is going to fly by. And Suzie was right
because for the next six days, that's all they did. Having the TV
feels like we're in purgatory. It's like almost normal life. It is my mom's birthday tomorrow,
even though I won't be able to spend the day with her. I got some time in here to make her
a little birthday present. Although I didn't go out and buy
something, I'm technically spending money on it. Tomorrow is day 50,
so I'm going to use toilet paper to do streamers
and decorate the room. It's day 50. Oh hey! So what do you think
your surprise is today? I have no idea. This one is a very big one. All right, so the offer for day 50
is $20,000 for you to see your family. They're in the other room watching that feed and they can hear
everything we're saying, - Hey, I miss you guys.
- Hi! I love you guys. I'll be back in 10 minutes to hear
if you're going to take the offer. Good luck. 10 minutes. This is like a pretty easy decision. What are your thoughts? Oh, my gosh.
I don't know. This might be the only chance in this challenge
to see them until the end. I think it's a
no brainer personally. So it's up to you on if we spend 20 grand for both. Of course. I want to see my parents too. It's killing me. He is a yes and she is a no. Mom, dad, tell me what to do. All right. What do you think?
And where are you guys at? He's been a yes from the beginning. As soon as you said it. About 10 seconds left. But it's my mom's birthday today and
we're saying yes. All right.
Give me $20,000 and I'll go get them. Best 10K ever spent,
I think. Okay. They paid the 20 grand.
Come on in. I'm so excited. It was a tough decision. I made you a birthday gift. And to celebrate her birthday,
we brought a birthday cake. This is the best tasty thing
they've had in forever. It's little things like that
that you don't realize you won't have
until you're in it. Bye! Love you. Bye! That's the worst feeling so far. The highest of highs. And now back to our little cube
all alone. Like I said earlier,
the things we're offering them are based off of what we're overhearing them
talk about in the cube. So you better believe that
when Suzie said this. Probably the only thing I'd say yes to at
this point is like if they do Tesla. You already know on day 60 I knew
exactly what to surprise them with. - How's it going?
- Hi. Oh, hey. First things first.
I brought you a giant mystery gift. Do the two of
you want to spend $50,000 to keep
what's inside of this box? Is either going to be the best moment of their life
or the worst moment. Just give me your answer in an hour. All right,
Thanks. We'll be thinking. 59 minutes remain in. I think we should. I know, I think it might be worth it. Imagine it is something
great and we said no. Would it ever be a car? Well, it could be.
Could actually be the keys to a car. It's not going to be equal
to the value that we're spending. She's right.
It's almost three times more. I don't feel confident in the yes. Then let's say no. But are you sure? Yeah, if you're not confident. I just know
they would never do a car. - Yeah, they would.
- Really? Yeah I feel like they could do anything.
Let's just say no. Wait, now you have me
wanting to say yes. Decision time. Okay. Do you want to spend $50,000
to keep what is inside this box? Yes or no? No. Really? What is your answer? I'm going with no. - Really?
- Yeah. I can't believe you guys
didn't take it. - Do you want to unlock it?
- Sure. All right, inside is $50,000, so you
would have got your money back. And then you want to open up
that stack of money. Just grab that. Here is a Tesla key for you
and a Tesla key for you. I'm so sorry. They would have gotten their money
back. Plus these two Teslas for free. Oh, I want to cry. Let's close this. That's literally my dream. We're going to head out. You leave their Beef. Thank you.  Bye. - I feel defeated.
- That's wild. Bailey... They got us Teslas. I feel like we made the wrong
decision. I'll regret this forever. - No.
- Yeah, I will. Oh, no, it's all a dream. I like my Prius.
Okay? There, I said it. And after getting hit hard
by yesterday's offer, Suzie literally whined about the Tesla for nine days
straight. It's really hard to see the positive
in all this. I actually won't be able to sleep. I'm actually feeling sick right now. I'm so mad. Suzie's taking it hard. And so to make up for it, I made sure this next offer
was the best one yet. It's day 70. Today's a big day
because this is the last offer. So obviously on day 80,
there's only 20 days left and on day 90 you're going to be like,
why would we spend money? - There's ten days left, correct?
- Yeah. - Let me just open the doors.
- Oh God No shot you reject this offer. What you see here is everything
you said no to so far in this challenge. Before I tell you the price tag, I'm
going to move everything in here. I'm gonna make it as easy
as possible for them to say yes. Nolan, just put those by the TV. As much as I love to
bully Nolan, he's just dumb. Here's a bed. If you guys say no,
we have to move all of this back out. Well,
then give us a good price. What you are considering buying
is these two $30,000 beds. A brand new mystery box. This one doesn't have 50
grand inside. It has something else. Sounds like 25 grand. One phone called each, spices,
monopoly, every single movie in the Walmart movie aisle. And lastly,
the cook you said no to. - There is a plate of food.
- I see a lot of good food. And to remind you how good it is, here's some chicken alfredo. That looks so good. It's time to find out
how much this will cost you. Behind these curtains is the number. If you bid higher than that number,
you get everything here for the rest of the challenge. But if you say $1, one penny lower,
you get nothing. I'll give you an hour
to figure out your bid. I'm thinking, what if it's like, way low
and they want us to say 150 grand? I think if we've been 75,
that would be too little. They're thinking at least 100 K. I actually feel like
we should go a little bit lower because we were prepared to say no
to it. That's true. But are you prepared
to walk away with nothing? And while they're deciding
what to do, I want to tell you about the Shop app. The Shop app is the best way
to shop on your phone and it's completely free. It'll basically look at everything
you're interested in and recommend you products you love. This is the only wild card because we know what beds are
and we know what movies are. We don't know what's in here. I have a feeling I want
whatever is inside. It's actually a third contestant. Help! And when you're ready to buy,
you can speed through check out using Shop Pay. Let's do this 80 grand 101,
because it's day 70. I don't want to go under 70. I feel like this gives us space. I get what you're saying. But imagine that was the reason why
we didn't end up getting all this. - Yeah.
- I would be so sad. Shop app will even track
all your packages in one place so you'll know exactly
when they'll arrive for the holidays. A $100,000 and $100. Yeah. It's not really
that much damage. - This is it, this is the one.
- Ready? Official We're flipping it. I hope we get it. Let the Shop app AI assistant scan hundreds of millions of products
all over the Shop app to recommend these perfect gifts
for this holiday season. Time is up. What's the number? Let me see it. Before you do, make sure you
download the Shop app right now. If you haven't already, I explained all the benefits of it, it's
a beautiful amazing app.  Download the Shop app. Okay. What is your bid? If it's $1 below mine,
you get nothing. $100,101. Chandler reveal it. 69. We get it! Yes! - You overpaid by 30.
- I don't care. We get the bed! This is the most excited I've been so far. Oh my Gosh! And this mystery box,
which I did clarify, was different. It's two smaller Teslas. No, I love this. I'll be teaming up with the Shop app to grant thousands of wishes
this holiday season. I'll tell you more about it
at the end of the video. Our room feels drastically different
right now. - It's a dream.
- We now have so many things to do. It's like a vacation. It's an investment for sure. I think it was well worth $100,000. You may think, Oh,
the challenge is over now, but one of them may lose everything
you'll see on day 99 what I'm talking about. Oh my God, this is crazy. Now, you would think that getting
all this stuff would make both of them
a lot happier, but strangely enough, the opposite actually started
to happen. One thing I took for granted on
the outside was a hot shower that I also did
not share with anyone. The hot water tank here
runs out so quickly and Bailey always showers before me, so I've been stuck
showering with cold water for honestly a couple of months now. We've been playing
the same Monopoly game for like seven days
because Suzie refuses to play like I maybe she just
hates board games. I think we need to take like three days
and cram as many movies as we can. All she ever does is read
or watch movies. We got to have like a movie
marathon. So whenever I'm like,
Can we just finish the game? She's like, Yeah. And then it never ends up happening. It's impossible to get her to focus. Hey, do you want to watch
The Notebook later? No, I don't want to watch
The Notebook later. We spent the last like 25 minutes
trying to choose a movie. And Suzie,
what did you say you're about to go do? Shower. Sorry. She literally
does this all the time. Bailey is wired right now. This happens
literally every morning. He's just nonstop, so energetic
all the time. I just had to come in here
because I can't go anywhere else. That's a rave right there. Bailey, it's 3 a.m. Yeah,
but sometimes you got to rave. Oh, get me out of here. You're the worst. Do you want to play Monopoly? No. Do you know where the dice are? Yeah, I hid them
because you keep asking me to play. So I was like,
maybe if I just hide them, then we'll never be able to play. Your toes look so long. No, that's sickening. My dogs are barking. I would like to be saved. Mom, I'm ready to leave. Even though at this point
they could hardly stand each other. With the end so close,
they set their differences aside and counted down the days. Four days left, three. And Bailey, well...  It's going to be Really couldn't wait
to walk out those doors. I wasn't in the middle
of saying anything. All right. Day 99. For me, it feels like it's been
honestly an entire year. I can't imagine
what they're feeling. I have to brush my teeth
one more time. Ever 24 hours remain. - This many.
- Yes. So this is the first second of
the challenge when you've both walked in. - Oh, my Gosh.
- How was that us? I feel like I look
like I'm a fetus in that. Come on in, gentleman. Set it up right above the door. It's so exciting. You officially have 24 hours
left in the challenge. Don't forget what I said. We got a fun twist for tomorrow. I'm scared. You think they'll still be friends
after this? Depends
what their answer is tomorrow. I'm worried that it's
going to be double or nothing. He's so, like, quiet about it. - You can't guess.
- Yeah. And with their final night
coming to an end, It was time to present them with an
opportunity to double their money. Hey, everyone. This is chaotic. What is going on? I don't know. Big boy. I want to help, but not really. They're literally just taking everything. Do you know what these are? Those are blindfolds
from the first day. That was quick. I remember it like it was yesterday. If you would both
please put them back on. Let's see
if they want to double their money. Okay. Oh my gosh, my heart is actually
beating out of my chest. 100 days ago, they were strangers. One hour ago they were best friends. Let's
see if they become total enemies. Bailey and Suzie, take your blindfolds off. So you might be familiar
with what we're about to offer you. You each have the choice to split
the money, and nothing changes. You both hit split.
You just split it. Keep what you have, or if you hit steal, you can steal
the other person's money. And if you both hit
steal, you would get nothing. Suzie has earplugs in and noise cancellation
headphones on top of them. She can't hear us.
What's going through your head? I don't even know, Suzie
if you put steal, I can't imagine. What do you say to somebody
that steals 180? Whatever. Maybe you get ahead of it
and you steal it. Fair. Do you hear that? Bailey actually might.
Bailey might. All right.
throw the music back in his ears. What if while we were over there,
he was like, ""Oh, this is a no brainer.
It's too much money"" We would never speak again. You guys have become, like,
such close friends. I don't know.
You get to know anyone. And when you've gone
through the same thing and like how hard this challenge has
been, we both deserve half for sure. But now you're making me nervous. Like I could do it, too. What did she just say? Maybe it'll be a case of you
thinking of someone. I don't know. If both of them press the steal button, they literally spend 100 days
in this room together for absolutely nothing. There's 30 seconds left in the
challenge at the very last second. I want you both to place your vote. Do you want to walk away
with 360 grand or half of it? No one speak. Karl and Kris,
you two don't talk either. I know that Suzie is going to split,
but the thought of walking away with almost $360,000,
I could do so much. Do you want to split the money
or steal it? The fact that I entered this
challenge, Three. Knowing that there would be pretty dark
times ahead Two. And I still overcame all those things One. There's no price you can put on that. No way. If the room turns red,
then someone stole. If the room turns green,
then you split the money. You both chose split! Yes! Yes! Congratulations on surviving! - Yeah!
- Yes! There you go, there's your money!
Follow me out here. And like I said
earlier in the video, don't forget to download the Shop app. If you go on my store
in the Shop app, you can tell me whatever you want
for the holiday. And I'm going to be fulfilling
thousands of wishes. You can say
like a Tesla, Yu-Gi-Oh cards. Feastables bars, doesn't matter.
Thank you Shop app. I appreciate you so much. And as always,  let’s blow this place up."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnTPaLOaHz8,"$10,000 Every Day You Survive In A Grocery Store",1292,20231202,en,"I just
bought this entire grocery store, which includes enough food
to literally feed an entire city. And then I decided to trap
this random guy inside. And every day you live here, I will
give you $10,000 in a grocery cart. That's wild, dude. Let's go. - Well I'll give it to you in 24 hours.
- Okay. This challenge could literally
make Alex a multimillionaire, which in theory means
he could be in here for years. And it starts right now. All right, Jimmy's gone. Why would I ever leave?
I could be here for years. Time to go grocery
shopping, baby. Now, if Alex crosses this red line, that we painted around the entire
perimeter of the grocery store. The challenge is over, and he walks
away with his current winnings. And to make sure
he stays inside. It's worth noting here
that we have countless cameras covering every square
inch of the grocery store. For my first meal on night one,
I guess I'll cook this steak. I think this is
just going to be home base. This little
corner of the grocery store. If I have meals like this every night,
I'll easily be here for years. Day one, complete. See you in the morning. It is officially been 24 hours,
and I got the first 10 grand. - Alex.
- Hey. Can you feel this and confirm it's $10,000? It is. I believe you. Now, we introduced the twist
of the challenge. Basically,
to receive the daily $10,000 you need to give me $10,000
in product from the store. And so you have to strategize
 what order to get rid of these items to stay here as long as possible. Okay. Conveniently,
there's a lot of electronics over there that are pretty
expensive for day one. That's probably a good idea. I can't really eat a TV,
so it's no use to me. You're $0.22 over. All right, let me check out. - Do you have an MVP card?
- No. - Would you like one?
- No. - Do you want to sign up for it?
- No. Here's your cash. Kris, take it away. I will see you tomorrow
with another $10,000 in cash. You should start strategizing
what you're going to sell me. This changes everything. I got to start strategizing for the future. I have to figure out all of
the stuff that I need to get rid of. Pet food, pet items. Jimmy cannot pay me
to eat this stuff, I swear. I got $10,000
worth of dog food right here. I think I'm just going to get some rest,
wake up early... because I'm going to have to prep
more items tomorrow. I got a lot of work ahead of me. - Alex.
- What's up Jimmy? Is that what you're selling to me
today? Today it's dog food. Oh, my gosh.
It's going to take us forever to move. Wait, can we do like a... I let him clap.
Transition, go for it. There we go. It's all over here at the register.
Isn't that a cool effect? I love Beast magic. We're at $9,991.80, And for the final item,
we are now at $10,045. And something you should know. Every single item Alex sells to me, we're literally going to donate
to charity. So don't worry, none of
this is going to go to waste. The next few days
were kind of a breeze for Alex. On day five,
he sold me $10,000 worth of produce. All this produce here,
they're going to go bad very fast. On day six, he sold me a bunch of diapers. And on days seven, eight and nine, he cleared out an additional
$30,000 worth of products. He even discovered
the backroom of the store, and since he hasn't showered in 10 days, he built his very own makeshift shower... and laundry system. - Hey, how's it going?
- What's up, Jimmy? All right,
as of now, give me an honest answer. How far do you think
you're going to go? Oh, I mean,
I feel like 100 days for sure. Oh, boy. Depending on how long Alex lasts, this may just become
my most expensive video ever, but I'm prepared for that. Holy crap, dude. I don't care if you go a year,
I got the money. Who put all this in here,
is what I want to know? The bank. You will get this once
I get my $10,000 in items. All right,
today I have more TVs. Who goes to a grocery store
to buy a TV? Why are these here? Now, Alex, be honest with me. Did you empty out
any of these TV boxes, fill them with rocks and keep the TV? Dogs. All right. I trust him. Even though
that was not what I was asking. Approaching day 11, Alex began to get pretty efficient
at picking which items to sell. $10,001.89. And since I had to leave to go film a video
where I stranded myself on an island... This is not comfortable. But let's pray we get like
30 minutes of sleep tonight. We had someone else
drop off the money for Alex. We call him ""The Money Man"". It's ""The Money Man"". Thank you, sir. $100,000. I can definitely reach a million. And what he did
with the rest of his time to keep himself
entertained was interesting. I am building a cheeseball wall. It's done. The great wall of cheese balls. Oh, yeah baby.
Here we go. Three, two, one... It was worth it. It was so worth it. On day 13, Alex decided to upgrade
his shower because... It's a piece of crap. What I'm going to do, is use four of these shelves
to reinforce the shower. Okay, here we go. I am going to use plastic liner,
drape it across here. The walls are waterproof now. All right,
You got to give it to him. This man is literally constructing
a functioning shower out of just raw store parts. And there it is.
Shower's done. Time to test it. Okay. It's been a few days in here. I'm going to build a wall. Now, I never thought I'd see this, but Alex literally used
all the water bottles in the entire store to build walls for his makeshift shelter. He even created a bed
using all of the toilet paper and it looked kind of comfortable. This is pretty cozy. I could fall asleep right here. I got to get to scan in, kind of had my eyes
on these bad boys for a while. Gift cards.
These things are freaking expensive. It is actually surprising
how expensive birthday cards are. Because Alex was able to hit his
$10,000 mark only using the cards. And after I got back
from filming at the island... - Hey, Jimmy.
- Hey, it's been a while. Alex wanted to see if we could help him
use the forklift in the back of the store. You know, if you could get it in
the store, that'd be super helpful. You're sure you're going
to let Kris drive this? Yeah. Three, two... Alright. Not the bakery. I think maybe one more. Yeah. Hey, it's in. Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah. Enjoy your forklift. We'll see you tomorrow. Even though it's only been a day
since he last saw me, it seemed like Alex
really started to miss me. At least that's the only explanation
I have for what he's about to do. I saw this
cut out of Jimmy over here. We're going to be hanging out a lot,
you and I. He's just going to watch,
make sure I don't lose count. Just scanning away for another 10k. $10,000.33 Over the next few days, Alex's efficiency was through
the roof, thanks to his new forklift. So he even had enough time
to upgrade his bed. and it was quite the improvement. It's is so much better. And even though Alex's original goal
was to get a million dollars... I think we're going
for a mil on this one. I hope not. He started documenting
what he'd spend the money on and came to realize maybe he didn't
need to stay as long as he thought. A million dollars is nice in theory. I'm still missing out
time with my boys. Both their birthdays are coming up
in the next two months. I've never missed a birthday yet. So after thinking about
what I want to put the money toward, I realized that I need to
at least make $500,000. But right now, I only have $200,000. So in total, I got 50 days, I got to be in here
almost halfway there. On day 22,
Alex decided to absolutely decimate all the goldfish in the grocery
store. Oh, my God. Okay, so this is $10,000
worth of goldfish. I could feed an army of toddlers. All right. Thank you, sir. You're living a regular life
now. Almost. You're getting paid
ten grand a day to miss your family. Yeah. And you can just do this
however long you want. Yeah. And you can just do this
however long you want. However long you want. However long you want. As you can see, the days
started blending together for Alex. But eventually, the day came
where he decided to sell the water that he originally used for his shelter. But since he couldn't
sell the empty shelves in the store, he realized
they make pretty good walls. I'm going to reinforce
the house with metal shelves. This is the way. As you can see, Alex is feeling
pretty at home now. But what he doesn't know is
when I bought this grocery store, I stopped
paying the electricity bill. So at any point now,
all the power's going to cut off and his freezers won't work,
the lights won't work, and so much more. The challenge is going to get way harder. But to give them some motivation
before things get pretty crazy. We thought Alex deserved a reward. - Are you excited to see your dad?
- Yes. - You ready to do this?
- Yeah. I think he might literally cry.
This is gonna be crazy. Alex, we have a surprise for you. Hello. - Oh, my babies!
- We brought some special guests Hi buddy! Yesterday, you were telling me about
how much you miss your family. I felt kind of bad. So to celebrate 30 days, we're gonna
to let you spend the day with them. What are you doing? You crazy boy. Daddy, I need to go pee. What's happening
with all the boxes on the floor? I made a race car track. - Is that the car?
- Yeah Wait, can he ride that? What do you think, dude? There they are. I can't believe that you guys are here. I know. - Dada.
- Come here. Today, I got to see Sarah and the boys. It was freaking amazing. And Sarah was as beautiful as ever. - I love you.
- I love you. - Bye.
- Bye buddy, I love you. Heart break. When I saw my kids,
I mean, they looked different to me, you know at that age, they grow weekly. I just look forward to going back
home, spending time with my family. What's up? I better get up
and start scanning stuff now. We're gonna... What the heck? Why are the lights off? What are these shenanigans? There's a flashlight. It's just some kind of joke? Houston, we have a problem. Did you do this, sir? Knock, knock. This is so much creepier. My power's out, Jimmy. Yes, so when I bought this grocery store,
they gave me a form to put, like, the utilities in my name,
and I just never filled it out. The cameras and cash registers
are hooked up to a generator because we need those.
So what am I looking at over here? Okay, so I had originally $60,000
ready to go. Oh, my gosh. But I assumed
now that the power went out, You're going to sell the frozen
stuff... Yeah. Things have changed. We need to get to scan it. Let's get rid
of these hot meats. Assembly line. All right, I'll hold the cart. Assembly line. I'm the door holder. And while they're clearing out
the freezers, I want to tell you guys
about Shopify. Shopify
help pay for this grocery store. And in exchange,
wanted me to promote one of the millions of businesses
they support in power. If only we had a bag that we could
put these things in to keep it cold. And together we picked Kanga Coolers. Chandler, what if I told you,
there's a 12 pack of soda inside of it? And it can keep what's inside cold
for up to seven hours. That's a long time. You got multi wieners.
You got single wieners. - Cheesy.
- Cheesy wieners. Kanga Coolers are
lightweight and insulated, so you can take them wherever. Hey, meet us at the front. Chandler, have you ever been
a cashier before? - Yeah.
- Wait, did you double scan that? Hold up. You can have the Kanga Cooler. You can fit a
human head in here. Anyways, click the link in the description,
download the shop app right now. You can buy a Kanga Cooler. I'm going to go help them
scan some meat. All right, here's our meat receipt. Here's your 10 grand. Also, here's a Kanga Cooler. Oh, nice. Oh by the way Alex,
I’m going to Africa for a week At this point, I once again had to
leave to go film a video in Africa where I built a hundred wells. Well number one is a success. Alex spend the rest of his day rushing to get all the frozen
food sold so it can be donated. Guess I'll just be scanning stuff
in the dark from now on. I really hope Jimmy turns the power on. It's going to suck. I'm not going to lie. Being left without power affected
Alex way more than I thought it would. I guess the food wasn't
the only thing getting checked out. I wonder if you can tip over a forklift? Careful on aisle seven. This store is turning into a wasteland. So I'm going to the back.  I'm going to open up this dock door
and let some daylight hit my face, breathe in some fresh air
because this is not going to do it. It's so nice. This right here
will give me through the dark days. It is day 36. I got $360,000. Why stop now? Got to keep loading these carts up.
Got a lot of food to get through. Just carts and pools of money. And waiting, waiting for the days to go by. The most exciting part of my day
is being this close to the red line. I'm just a sad,
old miserable boy back here. Nothing's ever been sadder in my life, except living in a grocery store. Coffee, food, and a lot of money. I'm like way ahead on checkouts still. I don't want to do anything,
there's nothing to do. All that stands between me,
my wife, my kids, is this line right here. The lights being off, being this close to the red line,
realizing I can go see my family. It's super tempting every day now I know there's
a bunch of pallets back there still that I haven't even dug into. Some glasses. Ice packs. What the... Look what I just found. InstaStart QuickPack lantern. Nice. I got five of them. I just lit them all up. They're on full blast right now. It definitely lights up
the entire space really well. I feel like I can actually
hang out in here again. Alex, are you here? - Another 10k?
- Yeah Let's go, dude. It's crazy I have all this money. But there's nothing I can do
with this money while I'm in here. Except just look at it. Well, you can't look at it.
It's so dark in here. - So I'm going to bring some lights in.
- Are you serious? For filming purposes. Alright. What are you going to do for
the rest of the time you're in here? Something I definitely want to do
is go ahead and just run through all these shells
with the forklift. You ask for this! What is going on? All right. Time for me to not be here anymore.
We'll see you tomorrow. Here's your broom. Thanks, guys. Enjoy cleaning. After spending an entire day
cleaning up Kris's mess, Alex took advantage of the newly
opened space to set up a pool he found in the back. Off we go. I'm going to drag the hose out here,
stick it in this pool, and sometime tomorrow
we'll have a grocery swimming pool. It's been over a week, and Chandler won't tell me what happened
while I was gone. This place looks
completely different. Oh God, open the doors.
I got to see this. Where did everything go? We did a little remodeling
while you were gone. This looks like someone gave Kris
a forklift. Everything makes sense now. - Can you show me the pool?
- Yeah, you want to get in? Flip. Do you wear socks? Yeah. That's crazy. It's freezing. Cannonball. What you typically do
in the pool? I just kind of float around. This was fun and all,
but I think we should check out. Thanks for the groceries.
Enjoy your pool. All right, I'm just going
to grab everything from the back and just put it up
here, organize it. And who knows?
Maybe there's some fun in there. It's no secret at this point,
Alex was pretty tired, and while he was making
his rounds in the forklift, something unexpected happened. Oh, crap. No! No! Oh God! Dude! No! Oh my God. I was trying to turn one way, and
it just went the opposite direction. Oh, my God. My freaking money is soaked. There's a bunch of products ruined. It's, like, so deep right here. It's in my space. It's all over the grocery store. Dude, I'm done, man. I just want to leave. We're going in. - Alex!
- Buddy. Why is it so wet in here? Yeah. Oh, Alex. Your golden chariot awaits you. Look at you in bed. - You good dog?
- I'm all right, man. You look like a defeated man. Yeah, I busted the pool. How does one bust a pool? So I was driving by to drop off
some pallets, and I tried to turn, and it just turned the complete
opposite way. I was like. No! So all this got wet? How many more weeks
do you have left? Weeks? I'm just taking it
day by day right now. Depends how much longer I can go. So if you just see like a spider in your bed
tomorrow, you're leaving? Oh, a hundred percent. Yeah. I don't think he has many days left. This is ending soon. You guys want to come hang out
for a little bit? - Heck no.
- You're depressing. This is what the store looked like
when Alex started the challenge. And this is what it looks like now. So day 44. It's almost dark outside. Jimmy hasn't come by today. I have stuff I need to sell. I'm just going to move
this stuff to the back. Hopefully somebody brings me
the $10,000 today. Maybe they just forgot or something. It's really lonely in here. I'm just going to go sit in my chair
till they bring me some money. Yo, what? Are you serious? Are you there, Jimmy? It's the first interaction
I get all day, and it's... the freaking robot. Thanks for the money. Not even Jimmy
wants to come here for a minute. That's how depressing this place is now. Can't say I blame him,
honestly. This sucks, man. God, I'm freaking miss my family
so bad. It's day 45. And Chandler,
how would you say he's doing? That is complete boredom.
He's just tapping the bat on the ground. I would feel bad for him,
except he's won $450,000, and he can leave whenever he wants,
so he'll be fine. - Alex.
- Hey. We were watching you on the cameras. You looked very sad. Yeah, I'm pretty bored. Well, here's $10,000. - So are you less bored?
- Helps a little. How many weeks left you got? Well, I don't even know
if I got an hour left, Jimmy. Really? Here, let's go look
at your sea of money over here. This is all the money
you've made so far. 450 grand. Are you saying
you're content with it? Give me one second. I've got a surprise
that might help you decide. What? Are you serious? Hey babe. What the heck? Don't cry. I can't help it. Okay. Why aren't you wearing your shoes? And your shirt? To be clear,
I didn't take his shoes. I don't know why he's not wearing
shoes. These are all the things that
this money's going to go toward. - Isn't this crazy?
- I can't even wrap my head around it. I feel like I could do another
five days. Do you think it's worth it? What's the verdict? - We've weighed the options.
- Make tons of money. Keep tons of money already made. Honestly, it's not worth staying
and I’m leaving. Okay, well,
then let's push the money out. All right, Alex, the second
you step on the red, it's over. I can move all the money back.
We can keep going. It's your decision. All right, bring it back in. Okay, bring it back in. Just kidding. Let's go! Alex spent 45 days in the store
and walked away with $450,000. Can't believe this happened.
This is freaking sick. Congratulations, Alex. Shout out to Albertsons for helping us
fill the shelves. You guys are amazing.
 I'm going to go find him a shirt. Also, if you're wondering
how we filmed this video because we blew up
the earth earlier, it was actually on the moon
the entire time. Watch the laser
maze video if that's confusing."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wdjh81uH6FU,"$1 vs $10,000,000 Job!",939,20231125,en,"I am about to work this $10 million
job as a professional athlete. And I'm going to show you
the difference between this and getting paid $200,000
to be an astronaut. This is insane. Getting paid $100,000 to dig up
real dinosaur bones. Oh, my God. And so many other jobs, starting with the lowest paying job
I could find. Gold panning, that can make as little
as $1 a year. But we're going
to make millions. Statistically, not. Basically, gold panners put dirt
in this mechanism, and with enough shaking and water, all of the gold
is filtered out to the bottom. But it's not very easy because after 5 hours of searching,
I was definitely not rich. Oh, boys. I found gold. How much is that
little nugget worth? That is $0.02. Exactly my point. You could do this for a whole year
and only make a dollar. But luckily for us, we're going to be working jobs
that pay over $10 million per year. But first, let's see what it looks like to work a job
that pays $100,000 per year. Digging up dinosaur bones
for a museum. And yes, these are fake
because they're all dead. So this is just one of our pits. - Are these actually dinosaur bones?
- They are. I've been here
17 years. This is easily the largest bone that I've ever
worked on in my career. This is your thigh bone right here,
and it's over four feet tall. For comparison, here's
that dinosaur next to six Karls stacked on top of each other. Keep in mind, I'm six five. These
are mini jackhammers, essentially. You're doing it.
He has no idea what he's doing. No idea. Now, this may come as a surprise,
but we are God awful at this. Be careful. It took us 5 hours
to make any progress whatsoever. But even with us holding him
back with the help of the expert, we were getting somewhere. This is easily the largest bone that
I've ever worked on in my career. - And you let me and Karl touch that?
- Absolutely. What if we mess it up? Josh, how much does this weigh? Probably going to be 2-250. - Pounds?
- Yep. This is 1/10
the weight of Nolan's mom. God that’s wild! Now, because this bone is
so ancient, we have to cover it in a cast
before we pick it up. Or else it could
literally break in half. Let's hope it doesn't fall apart
when we lift it. One, two, three. Yes, highway baby. Good job. This is the first time any humans
have ever carried this bone. Just Youtubers carrying a dinosaur bone. Front of the table. One, two, lift. Watch your hand, Karl. And believe it or not,
this dinosaur bone did find its way into a museum. But because museums are boring. Let's head over to the $200,000 job,
astronaut training with NASA and my first mission. Learn
to drive the official lunar rover. This is what will one day
be on the moon? Yeah. This is how we're going to get
around the surface of the moon. Why are they letting me drive this? Open the doors. How do I work this thing? - Push forward on a stick.
- Right now? Yeah, go for it.
Push forward. Jimmy, don't kill us. I'm scared. You good. Oh, this is amazing. - Go ahead and twist.
- To the right? To the right or left, I don't care. Oh, my God. They're cars. Is this street legal? Street legal around here. Oh, this is amazing. Why are we driving sideways? I haven't figured out
how to straight it yet. And even though I'm driving
like I'm actually drunk, I still managed to get us to NASA's
lunar training yard, where the real
test is going to be. Oh, we're offroading. Oh, God. Oh, it's getting bumpy. You're going to let me drive it
down this hill? Is there seat belts in this thing? There's a seat belt
we don't use right there. They've got seat belts they don't use,
that's helpful Oh, that's way too steep. No way. Are we really going down? Can I get that seat belt now? Oh, my God. Wait, we're going down the hill sideways. Stop it, stop the car. Lift your hand
so they can see I'm driving. He's actually… I'll get up and let Nick- No, sit there. - Do I go sideways in the crater?
- Sure. Hold me, Karl. Hold me. Lannan, I'm just going to say it,
you wouldn't survive on the moon. I reckon I could do it. Next in training, NASA showed me around
their enormous space facility. Holy crap. This is the second
largest pool on Earth, which, I'll be honest,
just felt like they were flexing on, especially when they showed me
the space suit. As far as anybody is concerned, once you try on a spacesuit,
you're an astronaut. But of course, there was a catch. When you go on a spacewalk,
do you have to wear a diaper? You're in the suit for 12 hours. There you go. Like an actual real adult diaper, Okay. So be careful. This is a space artifact. It's flown on the space shuttle
several times. - So real astronauts have worn this.
- Yes. Keep in mind
that astronaut peed in this. Have you peed in this suit? I have not in the suit. Okay. When's the next mission? What are you doing a year from now? - I can make time.
- Okay. And the final step of my training
was the craziest thing I've ever done. They were going to
let me touch the moon. No, no. Lean back into it
because it weighs 9,000 pounds. This weighs 9,000 pounds. Nice This is the largest collection
of moon rocks on display anywhere in the world. I can't believe they letting us do this. You realize, we're just a YouTube channel? Yeah. Oh, my God. These are just straight up on the moon. What are the odds you'll
let me touch the Genesis Rock? Zero. Yesterday,
we dug up a dinosaur fossils. I'm an expert in this kind of stuff.
Can I touch it? - No.
- I tried. This material here
is actually lunar soil. No way bro. So you're actually touching the moon
right now. Oh, that's wild. So that tube has dirt from the moon and has not been open since it came back. And since you haven't checked,
in theory, there could be an alien. Yes. Well, it would be the first
from the moon. - Wait, you guys heard that?
- From the moon? He said from the moon! And after we
found out aliens are totally real, we head into the stratosphere
for our next job where Karl and Nolan
are going to fly a plane. - I've never flown a plane before.
- We have no idea what we're doing. Welcome to the first day of flight
training. I'm not joking, for the boys
to somehow fly a real plane. All they have to do is land
one time in this flight simulator All right, here we have our throttle.
Pulling it back makes it go slower. Just like that. Oh. Oh, my God. And after Nolan crashed. Oh, God. And crash. And crash. You crashed the plane?! He eventually did land successfully,
which, for whatever reason, gave him the keys
to fly this real plane. Yo, I'm freaking out. Hey, if you can't do this, Nolan, please for love of God, let them know now. Oh, my God. I'm
going to fly a plane. Oh, my God. All right, you ready to go? As ready as I'll ever be. - Full throttle.
- Approaching 60. Kind of wobbly, but now,
just pull back a little bit. We're taking off. - There you go.
- Oh my God. Your life is in my hands. He's literally controlling
this entire thing. Yes, he is, all by himself. Turbulence has never caused a crash, right? Oh, well. Watch this, I'm going to turn right. No. Turn right.
Oh my God, we're sideways. I can't believe that
I'm controlling this thing. Look, no hands. Stop. Oh, sweet Jesus. You moron.
I'm going to murder you. All right, we're going
to go over there in a minute, we're going
to go back and land. Oh, my God.
I forgot. That's the one thing,
it's always a challenge for people. All right, I'm descending. My mental health is descending also. This is the part I crashed it
every time in the simulator. Oh, God. We're going to land right there
on top of that runway. Oh, my God. Wait, we're too close, right? Keep it pointed right down the middle. - Oh, my God.
- Easy. Keep your hand on the throttle. You're going to wait to pull back. Just breathe. Here we go. We touched ground. - You did it, man.
- I landed a plane. Oh my God. He said I couldn't do it,
but we're still here. You didn't kill me. I was genuinely surprised the job that pays
$1 million a year is hand modeling. But only if you're
one of the highest paid hand models in the world. She makes five times the average
salary of a doctor by letting people take photos of her hand
and her resume is stacked. She's hand modeled for almost any
brand you've ever heard of. Her hands are even insured
for $1,000,000 per hand. I can't wait to see this in action. So to start us off,
she examined our hands. I didn't know that today was going to be
the day that I'd find new insecurities. Okay, so immediately
I can see the nails need work. - Of course.
- I agreed. These
hands suck. Okay. Look how much hair is here
compared to Karl’s. Can I get paid more for that? The skin texture
might be better here with these two. Can you change me? I don't know if I can work miracles, but I haven't seen your hands yet, Jimmy. Your hands like glow. - That's crazy.
- Why are your hands so glossy? I don't know.
Are my finger structures good? Yeah, no they're
very good actually. But again, we've got cuticle issues,
skin issues here. But that can all be fixed. Our hands clearly needed work,
so we had to prepare them to shoot, which was pretty easy
for me and Karl. But for Lazar, not so much. Oh, God. Bro, you can make
a rug out of all that hair. This hair has been with me my whole life, but you got to do what you got to do
if you want to make a million dollars. And now that my hands are no longer
disgusting, we're going to model
for an actual magazine. And these photos are literally going
to be shown on billboards all across America
to promote these watches. - That's petrifying.
- Yeah. No pressure. Okay. I mean, the watch looks good. I honestly thought this was going
to be easy, but we were actually horrible at this. It looks like the watch is on a snake. Bro, this is so hard. Can I see the difference with you
doing it? - What?
- Unreal. The product looks better because
your hand doesn't shake as much. But being a hand model isn't
all about wearing nice watches. Sometimes you have to model
weird things. Why are you squirming? Because I see a man
holding a snake off camera. Breathe, Karl. Breathe. Put your other hand out here
and kind of support his head. Yeah, of course. One final thing I need to throw in
the mix is Immortals of Aveum, the sponsor of this video. Just hold that right there.
Okay, perfect. Now, he's modeling the watch, a snake and this game. Yo, look at that, that looks crazy. Immortals of Aveum
is a first person magic shooter where your player is a battle mage
named Jack trying to save the world, Karl. Can he save me? This time, I need you to model the Xbox
version of the game with a scorpion. No way, bro. You want to grab between there and here. Is this actually safe
for the animal? Yes. Perfect. Perfect. Get it, get it. Go. Go. Talk,
talk and go and talk about the game. You can sling 25 different types
of magic spells and unlock 80 different talents to customize your character
to suit your play style. Karl, you think Immortals of Aveum
is going to love that photo? Immortals of Aveum, I hope you love this. Karl, just hold the scary animals
and then, we get to go be NFL players. The people who created Immortals of Aveum
also helped make the award-winning campaigns
of Halo, Call of Duty and Dead Space. We love those campaigns. Oh, it's moving. And the cool thing is they put me in
the game as a boss. And if you kill me in the game,
you get more gold than any other boss
the game gives you. Nah, I got you. I got you.
Just don't look. Immortals of Aveum is out now with a free trial on Xbox
as well as PS5. And there's a free demo
available on Steam. I feel it under me. It's under my hands. We were doing such a bad job that we had the hand
model step in to ensure the sponsor would
approve of the photos. Click the link in the description. If you want to play Immortals of Aveum
right now. I'm retiring as a hand model, and even though
our photos weren't great, we still got them on billboards
across the country. And now it was finally time for the job that pays
$10 million per year. That's right. I'm about to literally join the NFL. This is literally my dream. And if you think this is all fake, here I am signing a real contract
to become a literal player for the Buccaneers
worth $10 million. It might say we're not going to pay it, but it at least says that dollar amount. No, no, focus on the dollar amount. And now it's official.
Congratulations. So for the next 48 hours,
I'm officially a player. You are officially a player. I promise I won't let you down. I promise he will let you down. By the end of my contract I'm going to be running out with the team on the field
in front of 60,000 fans. First step is weight training. It might be too light, let's go up. Let's go up. Easy. I don't actually think
they're paying me the 10 million. Easy! Easy! Are you a winner or are you a Falcon? Easy. Yeah! I notice they yell at you a lot
when you're an NFL player. Can you set it to whatever the
strongest player in your team does? I'm going to see if I can do one. He can do 12 of these? Holy crap. He's not a normal human. I would hate to be hit by him. - One more!
- Yeah! - Football!
- Easy! Come on. Why is the NFL so hard? How is this compared
to their typical workouts? It's pretty pathetic. Hopefully the lightheadedness goes
away. It will. You get used to it. Okay. Up next was my first practice
at the Tampa Bay Buccaneers training facility.
So naturally I met my coach. Hello MrBeast! I'm the coach.
How you doing? Good! And my new teammates. Nice to meet you, man. My name's Shaq. My kids love you. I love your videos. the candy bars, the Karl Gummies. Oh really? Yeah! And my new teammates couldn't believe that
I actually signed with the team, so I showed them
my contract to prove it. This is the same one
you guys signed? You got more money than me though.
I ain't getting much But if you read it says
""Unless it's canceled in 48 hours..."" We're still going to cancel. Yeah.
Look at the five. Y'all look at the parentheses for sure. Hey, you're official.
Welcome to the team. - Thank you. My new teammates over here.
- You got to work hard. These guys
make us look like children. They're so big.
Look at the size comparison. I'll be honest, I've never played football before, so
they threw me on as kicker, which... I was terrible at. Mr. Beast, we need you out here!
We got to get ready for tomorrow. You're right.
You're right. You're. I'll QB. And since I've never played
quarterback before either. I just threw it up
as far as I could. That's touchdown. In case you didn't know, the team
I just joined is the same team
Tom Brady won the Super Bowl with, so I thought it'd be funny
to surprise him. Oh, we got him, Tom. Oh, I almost got hit. TB, what's up baby? - What's up, TB?
- What's up, bro? How my boys doing? I have a friend here
who might literally die of happiness if you say hi to him. You can't do this to me.
You can't do this to me. Lannan, I love you, bro. I'm dead. After that, our practice
just devolved into shenanigans. Little man. - Tareq.
- Too small, yeah. You could go back to filming. All right, guys. See y'all. Some people still have some
questions about my two day contract. So afterwards the Bucs
set up a press conference for me. We obviously have a big game. I'm expecting very serious questions only. Is this just a publicity stunt?
Why are you really here? To make the best video possible. Yes, it's a publicity stunt
I clearly am not an NFL player. Jimmy, how does it feel
being on a new team? It feels great, to be honest. They've accepted me way more than
I thought. How much playing time are you expecting? None. And after
explaining over and over again that it's just a stunt,
I went to go get measured. Six foot four and a half. Six, four and a half? Karl, you're six five. - I'm six five. Yeah.
- Yeah. These measurements are key so that my gear and my uniform
are all custom fitting. - This actually looks so good.
- There we go. And now that I'm suited up,
it's time for the official game day. I still don't know why
they're letting me do this. But hey, thanks, Bucs. Are you surprised
they let me join the team? Yes. That's my first football
I've ever signed. Jimmy's about to come out any second now. They say if you get up by 100,
I can play a play. Do me a favor and get up super hot. Sounds good. It's his first game and probably
his last. Definitely his last. How is this happening? Fire the cannons! That's great... And since this is the only
NFL game I'll ever be a part of, the team, actually,
let me lead them out the tunnel. Let's go, boys. Yeah! - Jimmy!
- That's our friend. Let's not get run over by the players. Yeah! Is it the best day of your life? This is the best day of
my life, Jimmy. I love you. We're getting passed by the players. Jimmy's an NFL player. - How's it going?
- Let's go, Bucks. I won't let you guys down,
even though I probably won't get play time. - I love America.
- That's a big plane! America. Let's play football. Yeah! Huge shout out to the Buccaneers
for making me an official NFL player. It's honestly
a good thing that I didn't play because if they hit me,
I probably would have died. And I thought it was all over there
until the Falcons tweeted this. So, in retaliation,
I'm nuking their stadium."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dYTw-jAYkY,I Spent 7 Days Buried Alive,1113,20231118,en,"I'm going to spend the next seven days
buried alive under 20,000 pounds of dirt. This is the scariest thing
I have ever done. All right, well, I guess
it's time, bury me alive. That was scary. This is going to be terrifying. This is pretty much most people's
worst fear. Oh, my God. That dirt is terrifying. Brace yourself. Ha ha ha. Drop the payload. Oh, God. I feel like
I need to hold the roof. My roof is shaking. I'm entrusting my life to this
coffin for the next seven days. Let's pray it doesn't
just randomly decide to break. And obviously,
this goes without saying. But yes, this is 100% real. And I'll be honest, I severely underestimated
how hard this was going to be. And with that, the challenge
has officially started. I am now trapped in here
for the next seven days. It took the boys so long to bury me
alive that I already have to pee. And the challenge just started. In case you're wondering
how I use the bathroom down here. Well, yeah. This is so uncomfortable. All I have to survive
the next seven days... My foot! is the food in this briefcase, which is basically
just some MREs and snacks. My foot went numb. Five gallon
drum of water over there. And whatever essentials
the boys put in this briefcase, which probably means I'm
going to run out of food way before the seven day
mark. In all seriousness. This is extremely dangerous. And so I don't suffocate. I need to make sure
people are watching me at all times. Jimmy, can you hear this? Yeah, it sounds like Nolan's
mom is jumping on the surface. If we had 12 people,
maybe it would be that. It's almost 1 a.m. I have a feeling a lot of you
are going to start going to bed. I need someone to be near
a walkie at all times. So if I need something,
I actually need one of you to answer, okay? And now that I have
nothing better to do I'm going to head to bed,
and I'm either going to wake up well rested
or crushed by 20,000 pounds of dirt. Hopefully I wake up well-rested. Sleep is going to be key
to finishing this challenge, because when I'm asleep, I'm not thinking about the fact
that I'm trapped in this box. But that
only works most of the time. Is there a fly in here? The goal is to sleep as much
through this challenge as possible. For my own sanity. Oh, look at him. He looks so cozy. Jimmy Jam! No. Nolan drew all over your face. Nolan, how many hours
till your mom comes to set? No, I know you're going to say something. Hopefully she doesn't
actually crush the coffin. Show him. My strategy during this video
was to sleep the entire time. I completely forgot, though. My friends are going to annoy me
and not let me sleep. This is going to be miserable. I want to start today off by turning
these long pants into shorts. I just punched that box. Mission one complete.
Your boy has shorts. This is our food briefcase. Let's give this MRE a try. MRE stands for ""Meal
Ready to Eat"". All you have to do is add hot water,
and it chemically cooks the food. The boys, on the other hand,
we're grilling up steaks and literally
feasting on top of my grave. You know, Jimmy, just for you, we're going to eat MREs
for the rest of the time we're out here. - Really?
- Yeah. No. I literally heard Tareq
in the background saying no. Enjoy your hot water pasta in a bag. Meanwhile, this is my reality. Oh, it's crunchy. Why is pasta crunchy? This is...
This is great. I was so bored, I actually ended up
punching my coffin for fun until my knuckles started to hurt. So I put a sock on my hand
so I could keep punching the wall. I'm desperate for entertainment. Oh, Jimmy. Thank God I'm so bored. One second. What did you do? Yo, that actually scared me. Can you at least semi
explain to me what you're doing? Seeing how my life is on the line? All right. Unfortunately, the boys are
incapable of explaining anything. What they've done
is they've stuck a pipe all the way down to my grave,
vacuumed the dirt out of it, just to take this surgical wire camera and feed it
down and look at me suffer. Yeah, that's what happens. That's what happens. It's time to go in. This is so surgical. What is that? Oh, that fly on my leg freaked me out. Get away from me. You want to hold this steady? Just keep looking. - Move your...
- We see him. Having fun? Good night, Jimmy. And when day two
was coming to a close, the boys left me to go
spend time by their RV. And being the under stimulated man.
I was. I thought it'd be a good time
to crack into their essentials briefcase,  and see what was inside. Wait, he's opening the card. Is this Nolan's mom? I found a photo of your mom. Bro... - Did you do that?
- No, that was not me. Nolan, is this your mom? Oh, my God. She's on his chest. Oh, my God. Besides, somehow
losing this picture, if I had to guess what I think
would make me quit this challenge, it would be not wanting to poop
underground. Back pain, back pain, back pain. And maybe some back pain. And obviously, you can tell this is already
getting pretty hard for me. But like usual, you better bet
it's going to get a whole lot worse. It's raining really heavy right now. I just woke up to the sound
of thunder. Nolan, wake up. We got to check on Jimmy,
make sure he's, like, not crushed. I'm actually kind of concerned. This looks way more funeral-esque. You think that dirt's heavier now? Dirt plus rain is heavy. Jimmy I think I have an idea
of how to wake him up. Is someone drilling? It's one of those days. I don't even have
my pants on yet. And things are already getting
crazy. Jimmy, can you hear us? What are you doing up there? There are currently 15
speakers on top of your grave. So if I had to guess,
Kris is about to play stupid music. Jimmy, it's a party up here. Oh, my... Whoa! Yo, my coffin's actually shaking. Jimmy, there's an earthquake, oh my God. Wait, what is that? I just noticed there's
an unscrewed bolt on the side of my coffin. His screw's came loose in the coffin. From the base? - Are you kidding?
- Literally from the base. Should I be concerned
this wasn't screwed all the way in. Max it out. What the
heck are you doing right now? I'm vibrating. These vibrations
are kind of hurting my head. Why is there flowers in my hair?
I'm freaking out. Okay, let's go dig a tunnel. We're going to start the tunnel
right here and dig all the way into Jimmy's
coffin. We have the speakers blaring noise
so that he doesn't hear us digging. I've got an idea. We'll play construction
noises over the speakers. So that way
he doesn't hear the excavator. There's a loud noise, and no one's
answering over the walkie. So either I'm about to die. It's like playing a video game. Or they're about to do something dumb. Except for you could accidentally
kill somebody. I've officially crossed the 50 hour
mark. I have now been buried longer than
I was last time I did this challenge. I promised my doctor that I would move every day
so I don't get blood clots cause apparently lay down
for seven days straight can kill you. I'm digging a hole. We got to loosen up the dirt for Kris. I asked the boys to pack dumbbells
and they gave me 3 pound dumbbells. I smell so bad. Yeah, I'm going to do
my best not to think about the fact that I could die when I stand up and a couple of days. Kris, go a few feet deeper. I'm not certified to do this at all. I am bored in a coffin. We definitely stayed up all night and dug this tunnel
and didn't pay that guy to do it. Is this safe? - I'm going second.
- What's that? And then you bring up the rear Tareq. What is that? You guys come right behind me. One of the weird parts
about this challenge is there's so many cameras
always reporting at all times. We should dig a couple more inches
and then we're to the coffin. It didn't really bother me
the first few days, but I just have this weird feeling someone's always staring at me
and it's starting to, like, kind of... irritate me. Oh, there he is, there he is. - We almost got him.
- What is that sound I hear? Hi, Jimmy. What? - Hi Jimmy!
- Jimmy! Hey, Jimmy,
do you see us? I see Nolan's forehead. Yeah, it's hard to miss. How long did it take to dig
that tunnel? Literally all night, Jimmy. This is not what I
was expecting to happen today. Hey Nolan one second.
What do you think of that photo? What do I have to do to get
rid of that picture of my mom? This is the only thing
keeping me sane. - How do I get it back?
- I'm framing this and keeping it forever. I'm sorry. You've been in this coffin for so long that you forgot about
what happened to the channel. - Yeah!
- Yeah! We're almost at 200 million. You're going to hit 200 million
subscribers in that coffin. Wish I could see it live. Me too my friend. Nolan has a surprise
for you as well. We're going to tape this Feastables
bar to Jimmy. Oh, my God, it's hot down here. Is that the new Feastables bar? Hey, this is actually pretty good
marketing by my friends now in every time-lapse,
Feastables will be there. I hope tomorrow's easier. It's a weird feeling, I am very tired,
but for some reason I can't sleep. I don't know.
I've never had this happen before. Why am I crying? I don't know. Okay. It's officially day five. Only two more days
in this nightmare. I don't think humans are meant
to lay down for five days straight. I'll try to act like
I'm not depressed. Almost there! Jimmy, we got paintball guns, and
we're going to shoot your tombstone. That sounds fun.
Can I join? I don't even know what to say
to them. Jimmy, what have you been doing for fun? Nothing.
I'm in mental agony. Have you pooped yet? I have to poop really badly,
but I'm going to see if I can hold it in
for the next two days. I don't know why, but I have, like,
no motivation to do anything. I've been laying here for five days
and I don't even have enough energy to prepare a meal because going to the bathroom down
here is so difficult. Don't ask me how, but I accidentally
got some pee on my shorts. I'm cutting off the part
of my shorts that are infected. Sorry for how short they are now. That was disgusting. Jimmy, we're here to celebrate. We're almost at 200 million subs. Well, what's the estimate of
when we hit it? How long? I'm not a rocket scientist. What does he want from us? I've been feeling pretty terrible
all day for the fact that we're about to hit
200 million subscribers. Actually makes me kind of happy. You know, since we're about to hit
200 million subscribers, this would be a super convenient
time to talk about Verizon home Internet. That's a good point. Verizon 5G home Internet is exactly
what it sounds like. It's wireless Internet for your home
that runs off Verizon's extremely fast 5G
ultra wideband network. And don’t ask me how,
but the gang hacked it to make sure it worked
while I’m underground. We're turning it on now. Nice. Okay, I'm connected. And now you're going to watch us
hit 200 million. And just by plugging
in this little box, thanks to Verizon,
I now have reliable 5G home Internet. And because of our hack. It actually works. Even though I'm
ten feet underground. I can see my real time
subscriber count. Karl, did you know that if the people
watching this video are over 18, while supplies last when they order
Verizon home internet Verizon will give you an Xbox
series S on them. They must hate money. I mean honestly. Yeah. And you can get it for as low
as $35 a month. So if you want a fast 
and reliable internet, just go to mrbeastverizon.com
and put in your address and it'll tell you
if it's available in your area. And now let's focus on the 200
million subscriber goal. We are so close. Before this I was just some
random dude in Nebraska and... Now he's just some random dude
to North Carolina. I used to be
just a random guy in Nebraska. Karl, this is a heartfelt moment.
Don't copy Nolan. It's crazy that we used to like
talk about this sitting at a lunch table and now
we're at 200 million subscribers. That's insane. I just want to say it's
been an honor working with everyone. Let's crush some more goals. And finally,
Chandler, close this off. I first started working
here, it was like seven of us, and I was the janitor, and now we're at 200 million subs
and I'm very grateful. I started making videos
when I was 11. I'm 25 now
and I never in a million years thought the channel
would get this big. I mean, as we're about to hit
200 million subscribers, I just want all of you to know
that I appreciate every single one of you
to watch my videos. I still remember the days
when I would make videos and literally get zero views.
Thank you so much. We're going to see all these numbers
move. - Oh, my God!
- We did it. - Let's go!
- Yeah! We did it! Oh, I think it's unfortunately
time that we unplug, you know Wait, hold on. I haven't even got a chance
to call my girlfriend yet. Yeah, we got you.
We got you for sure. All right bro, we're
going to be right here. Okay?
You just finish that call. Oh, come on, plug it back in. I just want to say, like,
just 2 minutes. So my girlfriend knows I'm alive. - Let's go eat.
- All right. I don't know. I'm doing this thing where I'm crying and I'm not 100% sure
why I'm crying. Hitting
200 million with the boys was fun, but now I'm just alone
and trapped in here again. It's been five days. Five days alone in this coffin. I honestly have no idea
how I'm going to survive two more days of this. I'm going downhill quickly. Yo, Jimmy, how you doing? Oh, no response. I don't know if he's alive. Nolan I appreciate you
checking in on me and caring, but... Are you actually hanging in there? I know... Jimmy went from being terrified to an absolute yapster,
and now he's a sad boy. I'm doing my best
to talk to you guys for content, but to be honest,
I have, like, zero desire to speak. I just want to get out of here. Yeah, he's losing his mind. I think we need to find a way
to cheer him up. So I'm going to make
some phone calls. I don't know
if I've told you guys this, but I've already used up all my pee bottles, and so basically,
whenever I have to pee, I eat one of these meals,
and then I just pee in this bag and zip it up. I know
that might be too much information. This challenge is disgusting
and I want to leave. I was so down bad
that there was only one thing in this world
that could possibly cheer me up Jimmy, I brought somebody. Who'd you bring? My parents. How's it going? Well, have you talked about Nolan's
mom at all since you've been down there? No, not whatsoever. And the picture? I don't know what you're talking about. More importantly, do you guys
have something super embarrassing you could tell us about Nolan? Jimmy, there's so many. That will instantly
make this challenge so much better. He told us he was going to prom,
but he actually just went to the neighbors next door
for a little bit. We like to see him
bring a girl home for Christmas. That's all.
I needed to cheer me up because I know the comment section
is going to go crazy. I hate Jimmy. My mom has one more question. Hit me. All right, now you walk away.
That's how it works. Did he throw the walkie again? I know all of you like to sleep in
and you don't like getting up early. I don't care. In exactly 12 hours,
I need you all to start digging. Okay? That's kind of early, right? What time is it? As long as we wake up for
our alarms, we'll be good. What would you do
if when I stand up, I get blood clots
and just die on the spot? I'd know where to put you. See you in 12 hours. It's a date. I'm about to go to bed, and hopefully when I open these eyes in the morning, someone
is digging me out of this coffin. So I don't know why I'm tearing up. I don't think I've ever been
more excited for anything in my entire life. I can't wait to see the sunlight
tomorrow. I'll see you guys in the morning This is going to be awesome. Laying down for my final night. All I can think about
is whether or not I'd be able to stand
when this is over. It's not normal to be laying down
and not moving this long. Boys. It is officially been seven days. Yeah, I know you guys don't like doing
manual labor, but can you dig me up? We're getting you out, Jimmy. This is the worst
part of the challenge. Because I'm just waiting
for my stupid friends to dig me up. And of course, there's
the added tension of whether or not
I'm going to die when I stand up. So, yeah. Bring in the excavator. I bet you when I get out, the first thing
they're going to say is how bad I smell. this Santa Claus looking guy
is going to bring you out now. Karl,
I don't care what he looks like. Just get me out of this coffin. Dig, dig, dig, dig. Any second now this dirt above me
will turn into sunlight. I can't wait. Oh, that's the excavator. Oh, that's scary. I can see sunlight. Jimmy. Hey. - Jimmy!
- Jimmy! How's it going? It's hard to describe
what the sun looks like after not seeing it for seven days
straight. Oh, my gosh. I started crying once again. I'm not sure why.
I just couldn't help it. We did it. We did it. The only question that remains now is when I stand up,
am I going to die of blood clots? We'll find out in
just a minute. Jimmy, you ready? Don't drop it on me. I bet it stinks in there. You guys are predictable. I said that's what you would say. Well, let's not celebrate until I stand up
and don't die of blood clots. At least sit up for a second. But wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait. Wait for a medic to come down. Do you feel nauseous at all?
dizzy? Oh, I don't know. That's good enough for me,
come on up, Jimmy. This is my first time
standing in a week. Oh, my God. My legs are weak. - Oh, I didn't die.
- Yeah! Time to go. All good! I do feel like a rush of blood to
my head though. It's is actually a crazy feeling,
but the real surprise was waiting for me
just above ground. Oh, wow there's so many people. After seven days. I was finally able to celebrate 200
million subscribers, the right way. We have to celebrate 200 million, bro. Now that you all saw my underwear,
I'm going to end the video. And as always, let's end with an explosion."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwKJfNYwvm8,I Built 100 Wells In Africa,629,20231104,en,"This is the first of 100 wells
we're going to build in this video. Wow! Water! Water! - Oh.
- Oh, crap. You just witnessed a small village
in Kenya get access to unlimited clean drinking
water in less than a second. One down, 99 more wells in Africa
to go. You're going to love this video. Combined, these 100 wells are going to give around half a million people
fresh water to drink. And after building some more wells
on the side of Kenya, we flew south
to the school system of Nairiri. And let's just say
they were really happy to see us. How's it going? I was not expecting this. Thank you for the welcome. ¡Jimmy! ¡Jimmy!
¡Jimmy! Not sure how to react. I appreciate it, everybody. This village threw
a welcome ceremony upon our arrival and Nolan got really into it. Nolan's the most awkward person
I've ever met. And that's a lot coming from me. And after being shown
around the school. Yeah. Here comes our guest. How's it going? Are you having a good day? It's nice meeting you all. Have a good day. One of the teachers showed me
where the students currently get their water,
which is from this river, that's extremely unsafe to drink. This is where your students
used to get water from? Yes. This is crazy. Yeah. You know, students complaining of
diarrhea, infections like typhoid, because this is the water
we've been using. So we tried to treat. But you see, look at it, you know. But at the end of the day,
life has to move on. You have to get some water anyway. This situation
is obviously extremely sad. These children's
lives are being limited and sometimes cut short for
being forced to drink unsafe water. But at least for this village, we're going to
put an end to it right now. I don't think this John's going to fit. I have a big head. Let's see if we can find some water. It's raining. It's beautiful. After the water
comes out of the ground, it's fed into enormous barrels
like this one. And once they're built
into the water towers, all of the neighboring villages will not only have clean
drinking water, but a pressurized water
source as well, which, in short, means no more doing laundry
in unsafe water. And pull! On a scale of one to Nolan's mom,
how heavy is it? Nolan's mom times two. Oh, God. I'll push you off of this. All right, here
we go. Under control. We built 20 more wells in Kenya,
and after we were done, Bro has another well in there. Don't worry, I have more water
in my other shoe. Just so you know how we built these
first 29 wells... We use this giant drill to dig
hundreds of feet into the ground, past the polluted sources, and into an enormous
aquifer of pure, drinkable water. After that,
we spend time installing pipes so that people all around Africa can access water from spigots
like this one in Nairiri. Let's see how it taste. Like water. It took me about a minute to fill
this five gallon drum. How much water can this provide
a day? 3600 gallons a day. Not only will this well cover
the 400 kids at the school, but literally
the entire neighborhood and village around
this school can use this well. We say thank you for the water. No problem. This thing can basically
pump nonstop for 30 years. You would think that having an effect of this magnitude would require the resources
and funding of a large government. But that's not true. Solving this problem is possible
and it's something humanity should all be putting effort in to fix. What's the secret of success? To be honest,
just find something you love doing and do it for a long period
and eventually you'll succeed. So I'm going to bring it
super close. See us? - Isn't that cool?
- Yes. If you look up, it's recording. All right.
well, I'm going to get close. All right. Yeah, you can see yourself. We were also able to install a
well for this village. In this village
and these 12 other villages. And while we were finishing these wells, we were also able to update one of their schools
with brand new computers. - How are they liking it?
- They really like. - They like them.
- Glad to see it turned out well. And we also updated the classrooms
with new furniture, installed shelves
and filled them with new books, donated a soccer ball
for every student, - Thank you, Mr Beast.
- Thank you for this! and even put modern whiteboards
and projectors in all of the classrooms. Do you guys like the projector? - Yes!
- Yes! We were using a chalk that made a lot of dust,
but today everything is clean. We truly appreciate it. No problem.
It's the least we could do. But then when we flew out to the site of the 45th well,
we realized this community had it even harder. Every time they need to get water, they need to take a treacherous,
mile long hike through the jungle. And that mile long hike also happens
to be on a giant mountain. I wake up very early about 4:00
so that I can fetch water for the school. We are not safe fetching water here. That place is very slippery. Chances of getting in
an injury is very high. So while we worked on their well,
the community took me to see how they currently source water. You guys would have to make
this trip how many times a day? - Two times.
- Two times a day... So a typical student would carry
something like this? Yeah. - Yeah.
- Oh, God. If 200 students did this every day,
how hard could it be? It could be very hard. Oh, oh boy. Dang, this is very steep. We're just walking down
this mountain forever. Every day! It was actually surprising
how difficult this hike was. And these people go through
all of that just to get to this spigot. That water is still unsafe to drink. This is where you guys
get your water from normally. Yes. And filled with water, these jugs can weigh up to 40 pounds,
which is insane for these children to be carrying up this mountain. The ladies can carry two of those. Oh, I totally can as well then. And as soon as the jugs were filled, it
was time to head all the way back up. Hurry up.
Let's go. He's not even sweating or anything. No, I got it.
I got it. And now, instead of spending hours
a day for unsafe water, their new well is only ten feet
away from the school. So they can just fill it up here now. I'm too tired. And so
we were on to the next village where we built our 46th well,
but we ran into a little problem. We found out that this village is divided in half
by this huge, dangerous river. It may not look like much now,
but when the rainy season comes, the water comes up this high
and literally swallows this bridge. And why this bridge is such a
big deal is the villages over there, the hospital
and schools are over there. So they're crossing this bridge
multiple times a day. Despite how dangerous this bridge
is, it's their only option. This river, when it is swollen, it can sweep away people,
students or even animals. In the recent past,
we have lost about three people trying to cross this river. This loss of life is insane
and absolutely unacceptable. The moment we heard about this,
we knew we had to help. So while we started work
on a new bridge that would let them reach there,
well, we then traveled over 2000 miles from Kenya
to the country of Zimbabwe. We've been in Africa
for over a week, and we still have a lot more wells
to do. - You kind of smell.
- I know. It's weird. I showered this morning. If you let me finish,
I can put my arms down. Can I count on you two
to finish these wells with me? - Yes.
- Yes, yes. First on the agenda
was to check out a local hospital that was in dire
need of clean water. Upon entering, we learned how big of an impact
this clinic had on the village. How many kids do you guys
give birth to a year here? In a month... about 50. - So 600 births a year?
- Yes. But unfortunately,
the pregnant mothers at this clinic have to walk over a mile
just to get water and then carry these heavy buckets
all the way back. However, the good news is
we paid for the construction of a new modern well for them. All that needed to be done now
was to turn it on. All right, Nolan, are you ready? I'm ready. Over. Let me get a dramatic zoom in. Nolan, I pressed the button. Is it working? It's flowing. Do you want to go check it out? - Yes.
- Let's do it. I love how people are immediately
just getting water right now. This is easily
the coolest thing ever. Nolan here is a professional dancer. He will join. How do I always end up dancing? What is he doing? Oh, gosh. I won't make you watch this anymore. Besides
ensuring access to clean water, a lot of the students
at this village lack transportation. So we decided to give all of them
new bicycles. I know it looks like a lot of kids,
but we bought a lot of bikes. Full disclosure,
I don't know how to ride a bike. Jimmy only knows how to give away
bikes. Never learned how to ride one. Well,
that's great. Let's break in all the new bicycles. Three, two, one, go. Everyone's passing me. Be careful, I don’t know
how to ride a bike. I don't want to hit anyone. You want to ride it? All right, go for it little man.
Okay. And after giving away the bikes,
we continued building wells
until we reach... Well number 69! This solar powered well is specially designed
to aid the farmers in this village by providing more than enough water
for all of their crops and livestock, even during the dry
season without any electricity. Each panel is 200 watts. Then it's attached to a pump. That pump can pump 5,000 liters every hour. Basically, it's unlimited amount of
water for this entire village. That's incredible. And after we left Zimbabwe,
we wanted to continue to give water to communities all across Africa. So we built more wells in Uganda,
Somalia and Cameroon. And if you want to see more of
what we did in Cameroon, there's a whole video about that
coming soon, on the Philanthropy Channel. Spending time in these villages. Really, it made me reflect
on the importance of building wells, how it brings water to farms
to feed the hungry, how it provides clean conditions
for hospitals, and most importantly, how it helps the children
of this next generation live long, healthy lives and build the future
for all of these communities. We await a new dawn of clean drinking water. Water is life. And with some help from the locals,
we finally finished a new bridge that this community
can use for the next 100 years. Lives have been saved. Families will come together. The worries will be gone. The hundred wells we built in this
video, will change a lot of lives, but not enough. Which is why, before you go, I want to urge you all
to go to beastphilanthropy.org/wells or click the link in description
and donate money if possible. We're literally not profiting a dime
off this video. 100% of the money
we raise is going to go towards building more wells like you saw
in this video all around the globe. I know it's weird
that a YouTuber has to do all this stuff,
but someone's got to do it. And if no one else is,
we're going to do it. As you can tell, it really does change the lives of the communities
where we build them. And finally, well,100. Oh, my God. I'm so sorry."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjvpjXdgugA,"10 People Vs World's Deadliest Laser Maze for $250,000",1558,20231028,en,"This is the most
insane laser obstacle ever created, and this is just one of many dangerous and extreme laser mazes
that we've built for this video. Whichever one of these ten contestants
survives the longest wins 250 grand. Everyone, follow me. Welcome to room number one. You freaking kidding me? Yo! How are we supposed
to get through this? The rules are simple. You need to go touch that
box of money. But you touch a laser,
you lose $250,000. The billion dollar question
is, who's going first? Oh, okay. We have our first go. What in the world, bros? - I'm stressing out.
- Yeah. The craziest part is this is the
simplest of all the rooms we built. It gets so much harder after this. Okay. She's giving Number 1 no space
to work with over there. All right, y'all,
I got to get right there. This might look like a game,
but it's very serious. This $250,000
cube of money is on the line. Okay, good, good, good, good, good. All right. It's coming towards you. Oh my God. Oh my goodness. Hey... No! Am I out? Did I just...? Oh my God. Only nine remain. Oh, yes. You got it.
You got it. All right.
We got our first finisher. We got our second. I'm stuck. Where am I close? Where am I close? - Let's go, baby.
- We in here! That was surprisingly close. - Yeah.
- Let's go! And by the way,
this video takes place in space because in the last video,
we accidentally blow up the entire planet.
And no, it's not CGI. This is 100% real. Stop asking me that. Turn on the lasers. A little overwhelming. Very scared. In order to complete this level,
each of you will have to navigate this course
and then traverse this wall. All while the red laser walls
close in on you. Stay down the middle. And trust me when I say
this level is difficult, I mean it. I tried it earlier and didn't
even get close to pass. Start level two. Okay, we're going. We're going. Oh, man, bro. Hey, move the wall faster. Go, go, go, go, go, go. What the hell is this?
This is super hard. Go, go, go, go, go, go. Good job. Hurry. Go, go, go. That's cutting it close. I didn't even know we were starting. I thought he was just doing an intro
and everyone started moving. That was a little scary. I had to sprint through that,
it felt like... Follow me to the next set. Now everyone here may look happy,
but I had something to tell them. Not all of you survived. Someone actually hit the laser. I'll be back with the footage. Did anyone see it? I don't think I touched the laser,
but I don't know. I just want to make it
to the next room. I was like the second one
to jump in the pit, so I feel like I had enough space
and time. I don't know. We'll see. I didn't think I had it a laser. But if I'm the last person
and the walls are coming in like it might be me. - My heart is just beating out my chest.
- Me too I know. On this iPad,
we have who's been eliminated. I don't want to look. All right, everyone,
huddle up, huddle up. Oh gosh. So here's culprit number one. It's me. It hit your shoulder,
then your back, then your butt. It was actually impressive
how much you got hit by it. If we all want to salute him as he leaves. - Bye, guys.
- Bye. It's been really an honor. Up next, if you look right here,
we zoom in on number eight. You'll notice he didn't get out. It was actually you. Yeah. Oh my God. I don't know why you all are sad. Five remain. And now we can be happy. But unfortunately, that happiness
isn't going to last very long. Welcome to the next level. Isn't this insane? What in the world is this? I know it's a lot to process,
but this level is pretty simple. When the timer starts, you have 10
minutes to get onto that moving platform, walk across a balance beam,
then get on another moving platform, and then jump to safety,
all while avoiding the lasers. Start the timer. I got this. I got this. I should have got on. Hey, this is insane. That beam is wobbling, dude.
I see it moving. Let's go, Rain. 7 minutes left. I'm good right here. - Are you going?
- Yeah. Okay. So how are we doing this? I don't know, I'm not going to lie. That's for you all to figure out. We're stepping up. All right, here I go. All right.
10 is on the other platform. Two is on the balance beam? Okay. This is it. - Yes!
- Yeah. Girl power. Who run the world? Girls! Time's running out. Hurry up. Maybe you all go at the same time. Oh, she did it. Oh, there's two! Nice and easy. All right, let's see it.
You're the last one. Only 4 minutes remain.
Hey, there's a laser behind you. - Turn around.
- We're good. We're good - Yes!
- Yeah! Girl Power! Oh my God! There's only three and a half minutes left. It's going to go back. - Let's go!
- Oh my God! - That was sick, dude!
- Oh my God! Player eight is
the only one still competing. We got time, baby. We got time. Yo, I don't know about this one, guys. You've only got a couple of lasers left. Oh, my God. - There he is!
- No way bro! Yeah, that was the hardest one
so far, not gonna lie. Congratulations on surviving. Let's go to the next level
that has giant death beams. Death beam. Yeah, that's right. Death beams. I spent $42
trillion on this spaceship. You don't think
I'm going to add a death beam? Welcome to level four. What are we looking at over there? I can't tell. My heart is beating like crazy, bro. Boys. Fire the death beams. Oh! What the…? Yo! What? So as you'll see before it fires,
you see a little flash of light. Your goal is simple. Reach the other side without touching
any of the red lasers or getting absolutely cremated
by the giant blue death lasers. Have fun. Underneath it. Number six is safe. Eight's safe. Let me take that.
Let's go, come on. I'm good, I'm good, I'm good. Okay. Oh, man. It's only number four. I think he made it. Give me the box. Here, touch the box. Dubs baby. Let's go. That one got the adrenaline pumping. I'm glad four of you survive because,
like, levels six, seven, eight, nine and ten,
we're all very expensive. So I hope you don't all lose soon. But to be honest,
I'd be very surprised if someone didn't lose
on this next one. What the heck is this? Come inside the prison. Close the laser door. Oh, bro. You're now trapped
in a giant laser prison. And at some random point in the next
10 hours, these lasers will turn off for exactly three and a half seconds, and you'll have to run
and touch the money before they turn back on, you know how
short three and a half seconds is? - And how massive this room is?
- No way, bro. - No way.
- Have fun. When do you ever get 10 hours
to prepare for the biggest three
and a half seconds of your life? How long can a person
go without sleeping? I've gone like 48 hours for sure. - No problem.
- Why? I was, like, playing
video games one night or something. You think we're actually
going to get to the 10-hour mark? I think we are. It's pretty intimidating, not going to lie. Simon says touch the laser. I don't know what the
rules on tripping are but... we might find out pretty soon. Turn off the lasers. Please. I'm really hungry. - Yeah.
- Think they're going to bring in food? We ain't getting no food. And if they bring dinner in here,
we're here for 10 hours and they bring some kind of food. Oh, sheesh! How's it going? Just wanted to make sure you're awake. - We're awake.
- We are now. How many hours
do you think it's been? I think we're going on three. It's been six and a half hours and you're
probably hungry, so boys bring it in. We also brought you guys some Prime. Thanks, KSI. - This is your first time trying Prime?
- This is my first sip of Prime. Let's see it. - Your first ever sip of Prime.
- This is crazy. - What do you think of it?
- It was just like the Popsicle.  I was surprised as well. It tastes pretty good. - Enjoy your Prime and food.
- Thank you! Thank you. - 6 hours?
- I don't think so, bro. It's not been 6 hours. The minute these turn off, I'm out. This is starting to get not fun. I do not spend all this time in here to not touch that box. Do you know the
longer that we stand in here, the slower you're
going to run across?  You're going to be done for. 10 minutes to 10 hours, Like what kind of range is that,
Jimmy? What are you doing to us right now? This is crazy. I feel like an animal in a cage. It's five in the morning and
they have been in there for seven hours. The stakes are high. They're all staring at the money. It's getting primal. But if we press this button,
the lasers will cut off for three and a half seconds. You may press the button. Will they make it? Will they make it? They all got it. That felt like the end of the world. Oh, my gosh. How are all of you that alert? It is 5 a.m. That was 7 hours. We're just that determined. Because nobody got out, we're going to have to run it back
for another 10 hours. - I'm kidding, that was a joke
- Okay. Okay. It's been way too long of a day.
Follow me. We're like, ""What?"" We're like, ""Wait a minute."" But days are kind of irrelevant
when you're on a spaceship. A giant spaceship. Come on in. - What...
- Morning! - ...in the world?
- Morning. Come on in. So welcome to Level seven. Dude.
What in the world, bro? You're probably wondering, why am I holding so much prime? It's because Prime Hydration is a zero
added sugar hydration drink. This bad boy is only 20 calories,
naturally flavored with 10% coconut water and enough vitamins and electrolytes
to keep these contestants going throughout the entire video, all without
a single milligram of caffeine. And because the company is founded
by my friends Logan, Paul and KSI, if you do this course
while holding prime, I'll give you $10,000. - Holding a bottle or the whole tray?
- Just holding a bottle. Here you go. Catch. Each contestant needs to hold
a bottle of Prime while jumping from platform to platform
and avoiding the lasers on the floor. The lasers will briefly disappear
every 30 seconds, so they're welcome to try what seems to be the easy
way out and risk running. Or they can make the jump. My heart is pounding. - Can I go?
- Yeah, go ahead. Yeah, you go first, if you want. Dude, I wanna take my time. Okay, I think I can make that. Oh, he just jumped. What the heck? The thing is, the further
you get, the further they get apart. I don't know if I can jump that. Nice, Rain. Oh, this is scary. Are you going to jump it
if I move? Once she jumps, I'll jump. All right, bet. Just in case. Just in case.
I could use the floor that time. You see, I knew it was coming. That was smart. Okay, now my adrenaline is pumping. - Yes!
- Let's go. All right. She's alive. We're good. That was good. You went so far. I don't know if I touched it, though. We got to look at the camera footage. We're going to replay that,
instant replay. Karl, what's the verdict? Number 8 is eliminated. You definitely hit it, I promise. We'll still give you
the $10,000 for the Prime. It's official. Oh, no, I'm sorry. It hurts. It hurts. But, you know... Hey, grab that 10 grand briefcase
for the Prime. Prime makes it taste a little bit
better, makes it go down some. See you, dude. Thanks Jimmy. No problem, thanks for coming out. - You have a great day.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Life is crazy right now. And now three remain. Number 4 isn't ready,
but he's going after this one. You're good, you're good. How does your heart feel? Better. I'm going this next time. Don't play no games with me, okay? She got it. I'm going to get out the way. All right. We have our first finisher. Thank you! Oh, look at those feet. Straight shot, baby. He almost broke it. Dude, I lost my first step. Don't kiss my money. Why's he kissing my money? Last one remaining. That's a lot of pressure. Okay. Okay! We have three finishers. Yeah. And these next three levels are going to determine
who walks away with $250,000. Welcome to Level seven. You have two choices. You can either eliminate yourself
and win a Tesla or keep competing for a chance
to win $250,000. What will it be? There's like a billion lasers
over there. You think
you got to get through that? If you're a quiter,
go for the Tesla. You have a guaranteed
40 grand or a 33% chance of 250. There's a way through these lasers,
though, right? Of course.
Nolan. - You're being annoying.
- This thing's just really comfortable. That's the car I wanted.
I got to get the money. Give me money! - All right.
- Yeah. - Okay.
- Boys, boys. Go get your cars, ladies.
I'm going to get this cash. If all three of you go over here to get it,
that's crazy. I'm going to send it. I want to make it to Room 10. This is actually
a big decision for you because you know they're doing it
now. They can't come back. - Yeah, I know.
- If you pick the Tesla... you can drive it out today. There's a chance you walk over
with nothing over there. - You don't want the money?
- Yeah. Turning it down? Look at this thing. Five, four, three, two. You can walk out with this car. One... Just go get the car. Take your pick. I know. - I'm sorry. You'll probably hate me.
- Just pick! Free car or a chance to win money. I'm going to go with... The money. - Let's do it.
- You never get this chance. Head on down there.
Let's do this. I cannot believe nobody
went for the Teslas. Go ahead, Rain. You waited long enough. Dang! I'm good. Look, I got to make sure
this booty don't hit nothing. Dude, that is so tight. Yeah, that is tight. There's two paths
and one is a dead end. I think she's going
to the dead end. Oh, my gosh. You are, like,
literally a millimeter away. She's about to shimmy
her way to 250 grand. Well, a chance at 250. - You have one little choke-point left.
- You're almost done. I'm coming, Karl. I can see you right now and
there's no lasers between us. Hit that. Yeah. Touch that. All right, we have our first finisher. I did it. I did it. You could do anything. Ten, if they both touch lasers, you win. - Six… it's not a race.
- Oh my God! This isn't NASCAR. - I know, I just...
- Are you going for a world record? I'm just scared if I don't go through this,
I'm going to start shaking. Let's go! All right, one more. Everyone focus your attention on four. This is the hardest part right here. It gets very, very narrow. Oh, watch your foot. Will his butt hit it? I know it hasn't. I said, ""will"".
I'll speak more clearly. Oh, my God, I'm literally sweating. That is so tight. I need to get out of here,
if I go right there and jump over. Can I do that? I approve. You can jump over
the laser wall. Yes, if he can clear this wall, He might win this whole thing. You think it'd be easier to jump over
this and walk along the edge and jump back over
than to go through the base? I mean, maybe not easier,
but I definitely have more confidence doing that.
I want to see you jump over this. Just to be clear,
I think this is awesome. Now, who's the one
having to make a decision, Blake? I can clear that, I'm doing it. He did it. That was crazy. You two thought
he was going to hit it. Look at their faces.
They're so mad. What the heck? - Now he's walking along the edge.
- Oh my God. He's going to have to jump back now. Dude,
it is definitely taller over here. We didn't build the set with this
in mind. He's literally breaking the game. And our set, apparently. These walls aren't super strong because we didn't
plan on people doing this. If you fall, you're out.
Just, you know. This is insane. No way he did it. What the frick just happened? Let's just go to the other room. Follow me to the in-between room. That was the craziest thing
I've ever seen. Starting out when
it was ten of us... Did any of you all think
it would be us, last three? I saw both of you as a threat. You all are like the same person. If you were silhouettes,
it'd be like the same person. As long as I keep going first,
that's going to be the way I win. Honestly,
I can't follow behind anyone. I have to trust in myself
and go for it. I won't lose. Complete honesty,
I have no idea what happens next. That's why
I want to get to the next door. Let's go to the next room. Now, making a bunch of
laser mazes is pretty tough, so I had my friends
help me with this next one. - Welcome.
- Hi, guys. - Hey.
- This is your money. This level only has three lasers. I let each of the boys place a laser,
and those are the only three ones on this level. Turn on Nolan's laser. I call this one the ""up and down"". That's not that crazy. I'd call it pathetic. Turn on Tareq's laser. I call this one side to side. Very creative. What do you guys think of it so far? - That's pretty crazy.
- It's pretty hard. Now turn on Karl's laser. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And there you go.  Level 8 is these three lasers. Not a fan of the green one. Hey, guys, you're supposed to run, not sit. Hey, why don't you guys
go to the control room? - I see the path.
- I see the path too. Oh, he's gone. What the heck? Hey no pressure, guys. He didn't even say he was going. He just. He just went. What just happened? I blinked,
and he was already at the money. I know I wasn't saying much,
but I just had to zone in, block everything out
and see the path and take off. We officially have
our first finisher. If they both get out,
you win $250,000. No pressure, fellas. Oh, she's going. All right, our second go. The green hit her. It's up to you, Yei! The only thing standing between number four
and a quarter of a million dollars is you. If you get out, he officially wins. This is... I don't know, dude. You got to show me
how bad you want it, Yei. I'm really scared. What'll get you out? - The Karl laser.
- Look at me. The Nolan laser, the Tareq laser. Oh, she's gone.
She started a little bit... Okay, the red one. She did it. She did it! - She made it!
- Yeah, it was incredible. Well, I feel like she made that
30 trillion times harder than he did Did the laser touch me? No, you did it. Are you sure? Didn't hit a laser.
You're good. What? You got to be kidding me. Oh, my gosh. It's time for us
to go to the ninth level. Only one of you is going to survive
this final level. Basically, it's a level
where you go until one of you loses. - Okay.
- I'll see you there. - Are we fighting? Laser tag?
- I don't know. I'm going to launch a nuke
at the moon. I have no reason for doing it. I just wanted to. Let's see who wins $250,000. I'm nervous. Yeah, this is a mental challenge.
Trying to stay zoned in. Going on 5:00 AM right here. But I came this this far. I'm in confident
this whole time. I promise I'm ready. It's like, what, 5:00 AM? Yes. I don't even know.
I don't even know. I'm tired. But I got to do every
one of these rounds, and just like,
show people that I can do it. I hope they both win. - That's just not how it works.
- They both really deserve it. Just add suspense. We made them wait a few hours. This sucks. I know. I hate it so much. Waiting's making me nervous. Oh, my God. I can't believe you both said no
to the Teslas. It's top three. You got it.
I mean, we're one room away. Go big or go home. In your mind, what are the
odds you win the next level? 100%. Really? I feel confident. Well, he's pretty confident,
but I'm just like... I hope I win,
I really, really hope I win. You guys have any last words? Not really.
I'm kind of, I'm kind of zoned in. I'll shake your hand. And now we're enemies. Welcome to the final level. For this last level,
we combined all the previous mazes into one. Player number six come in. My Lord. Hold there for one second. Player number four, come on in. Holy smokes. Okay. Since there's only two of you,
this one's a little different. You either touch the money first, instantly winning it, or your opponent touches a laser
before you, thus they're eliminated
and you instantly win. Number four, does that make sense? I hear you out loud and clear. Number six, does that make sense? Makes sense. I'm going to give you both 30 seconds
to weigh this massive strategic decision. This is for all the marbles. I want to win this. Dude, my heart is... Dude, he looks so nervous right now. If you try to run this,
you're going to hit a laser. I'm just standing there.
That is definitely the strat. I got to play offense.
I want to go as far as I can. Ten more seconds. Yep, as fast as I can. Release the dogs. I'm going to send it. I'm not waiting for him to mess up.
I'm going to send it. Say the word Jimmy.
Let me go. Let me go. I'm not waiting. Three. Two. One. Begin. All right. Like I thought Blake is going for it. He is way ahead. Okay. All right, they're about tied. Okay, so far no one's out. That was close. Blake is way ahead. Okay. Her only hope is that he ends up
getting out here. He hit a laser. What? - He did, he hit it.
- What? You're lying. No, hey cut the lasers off. It doesn't matter. - What?
- Turn them all off. Don't headbutt it. Are you okay?
Stop hurting yourself. What?
That's freaking crazy. And obviously, Blake, we're going
to give you a second place prize of another $10,000. because he won $10,000
during the course of Prime. I know it's not a quarter of a mil. - Here's another ten grand.
- Thanks, Mr. Jimmy. Do you want me to deliver it
in a giant cube or would you prefer me
just wire you the money? I want you to bring it to me
in a cube. - What if they try to rob you?
- Oh, I don't know then. I'll wire you the money. I hope you guys enjoy it.
See you later. You can stand in it. Just, you're going to sink, so be careful. - Yeah. You see what I mean?
- I sunk through."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ryID_SwU5E,"$1 vs $100,000,000 House!",1022,20231014,en,"This is a $100 million mega-mansion
and it's possibly the most luxurious house
ever built by mankind. And we're going to be comparing
living in this house to living in this $69
million art house that's built to withstand
a literal tsunami, a $30 million palace
with its very own waterpark and everything in between,
all the way down to this $1 barely functioning house. More of a shed. Well, it's only a dollar. Why does this house cost a dollar? Yeah, we get another storm, it's
probably going to go into the water. So it's worth a dollar for me
just to get rid of it. So you would say
this is a horrible investment for me? - Yes, indeed.
- Let's do it. Let's go. This is sketchy. What are the odds I fall through? Pretty high. Bro, these are wobbly. I like how that chair is just
like holding on for dear life. We have a recliner, a mattress
and half a floor. I can literally fish
from inside of the house. Yo, I caught one. That's just the lure. I'm sorry. Now that you see us having fun,
do you regret selling it? I do not. What if I gave you $2 to buy
back off me? - No.
- Alright, I tried. I have an idea. Let's get out of this house. Later in this video, we have a house that cost
100 million times more than this. And because I never plan on setting
foot in this worthless shack again... Let's head
over to something a little nicer. Speaking of which, we're
at the million dollar house, which technically means you need to be
a millionaire to buy this house. Let's show you
how a millionaire lives. My first impression
is it's way bigger than my house. When you pay $1,000,000,
you get a pretty good sized kitchen, along with four bedrooms
that look normal. But they keep going because this bedroom has a closet
here which leads into a bathroom that's bigger than the $1 house. The bathtub is gigantic. I'm six foot five and I can fit
in this perfectly comfortable. And even though the bathrooms
are all stocked with bidets Oh God! The best seat in
the house is definitely downstairs. Oh snap! They have a movie theater. Dude, these chairs are massage
chairs. Wait, what? These chairs each
have two remotes. Two remotes! On top of the movie theater,
there's also an arcade. I was not expecting
all these features for $1 million. This house is awesome. I'd have so much more friends. If I owned a place like this and ending with the pool,
which comes complete with this unnecessary waterfall. Overall, I'd say this is a
pretty fun house to live in. But of course we're all here
to see the richest of the rich. And that's why up next,
we have these $15 million... $15 million house. Wait, you pushed it? Oh, my God. Jeez, man... I don't belong here. This looks like the house
that you tried to get to in GTA. That view is crazy. The pool is much smaller
than the $1 million house, but you can literally oversee
all of L.A. Help! Hey! Help! Stop. Stop. Go inside. I need new friends. Let's check out the house.
The person who owns this house. What do you think
he does for a living? NFTs He's a lawyer. This guy was the top attorney in 2017
and the number one lawyer in 2021. Apparently, that's all
it takes to afford this house. It appears a note was left for us. Dear MrBeast, thank
you for visiting my home. You have given me the ultimate gift. I have a trump card with my kids
forever. Also, please don't eat
any of the sandwiches. They are very sacred to me and my family's been passing it down
from generation to generation. Got it. - Down or up?
- Down. Down it is. Okay, now it's starting to look nice. The lower floor of this mansion comes with its very own movie
theater and personal gym. This treadmill requires a passcode
to use. Six, nine, six, nine. It's not six, nine, six, nine. A guest bedroom, an entertainment
area and a bar where the owner left us a bunch of free food. - Guys, before you eat anything.
- Yeah. What if he left this out
so he could sue us for eating his... Well, too late now, Karl ate it. And an incredible underground
view of the swimming pool. Yeah. Nolan's trying to swim
in the background for the shot. I don't think he realized
we stopped filming him. Back again? Yeah, do it one more time. And now a master bedroom
with another crazy view. Karl, come here. You missed. We got another one. You missed again. Oh wait! Nolan, stop it! Nolan, stop this cushion also. Stop throwing cushions. If it goes over the edge he might sue me. And so to avoid being handed court
papers, we decided to fly all the way across the country to Massachusetts
for the $30 million dollar house. This extraordinary 16 bedroom
estate has four different buildings. In the main house. There are multiple living rooms,
but this one is the best of the living rooms in this property. This is grand. - What is this?
- The Oval Office. What book would you expect here besides The Way To Wealth by Benjamin
Franklin Bro made the light bulb and a book? Well, Edison made the light bulb.
Not Ben Franklin. What the hell did
Ben Franklin do? I'm going to read this book. Past the living room in the office was the Grand Kitchen where
the owner had left a little gift for us. The owner of this place.
got rich making candles. So he made us
custom MrBeast candles. That one smells like the beach. It does. How do they put the beach in a candle? And to top off the house's
main building, Chandler discovered that... You can hit golf
balls off the roof. Fore! That's not even close to
the coolest thing about this place, because next door
is a garage filled with exotic cars. This looks like a garage
out of a video game. They got Lamborghinis
on top of Lamborghinis. It's like a candy store for adults. The best part is
this is just one of two car garages. - Follow me.
- There's more? Bro, there's more cars in here
than the other one. Holy crap! All right, now I am convinced if
we steal a car, he would not notice. How do you even buy these cars?
Hey, I want three of the same ones. It's like a full time job
to buy this many cars. There's stairs in the corner.
Let's see where they go. Bro, this is like a
closet with cars. Underneath the car garage
is another army of cars. They should really invest in a light
switch down here. They have 20 cars down here,
but no lights. - Did I...?
- No way! No. No way! That's
why there wasn't a light switch. I was like,
who can afford to shove 30 cars in their basement
but not electricity? Now, don't get me wrong,
all of the rooms in this house
have been awesome so far. But if I owned it, I don't think
I'd ever leave this next building. This is awesome. That's right. For some just ungodly reason,
whoever built this place thought it would be a good idea to install an
entire indoor tennis court. I just want to remind you that
we are playing tennis inside a house. I also have no idea how to play
tennis. Gang squad, follow me. What?
No way! Two story arcade. The arcade in this house is actually 20 times bigger
than the one at the $1 million house. But that's not all. Bro, this place literally has everything. All right, I'm never leaving. We're playing ping pong
in a basketball court, in a house. First try, baby! Now, all of the features of the $30
million house have been pretty cool. But this next room is
what makes this place truly special. Head up these stairs
for the best part of the estate. What you really want to see is
right over here, look at this. This is an indoor waterpark. It's like a whole new world in here. Look how far back the drone is
and it's still going. Go have fun,
but don't break anything. Roger that. We're all about to go down
the slide together. We're going to enjoy the waterpark. I'll see you at the next house. The only bad news is it's once again
across the entire country. The good news is it's a $45
million mega-mansion. - What!
- Oh, my gosh. This is like the most open house
I've ever been in. What? I don't know what majestic thing
this is, but it's beautiful. As you can probably tell, these houses
are starting to get so expensive, I don't even know how
to describe them anymore. Honestly, lost for words. This is quite possibly the most
beautiful thing I've ever seen. So I called in multi-billionaire
Mark Cuban to help us out. - How's it going?
- Hey! - How's it going, little man?
- Nice to meet you. Mark's also the proud owner of
the Dallas Mavericks basketball team. And because this house
has its very own basketball court, you can imagine
we got a little distracted. - Jimmy won't make it!
- Buckets! Just steal it from Karl. Hit that. - No shot.
- We get those. Yeah, that's it. Go, go, go, go, go.
Easy lay bud Yeah. There we go. Jake's play wins.
All you. Hit it. Game winner. Oh, no. Yeah! Way to dominate, Jakers. Now, we're going to show Mark
around the rest of the house, Now that we're all sweating. To find out if he thought it was worth
the steep $45 million price. In case you're wondering,
we didn't go swimming. It looks like I did go swimming. - How much do they want for this house?
- 45. - Not worth it?
- Because it's Brentwood. That's probably half of it. Is Brentwood what that is? No, the neighborhood. I also thought he was talking
about the wood in the house. That's funny. This bathroom over here, it's nice. Do you have a couch in your bathroom? - Yes.
- Oh really? Yeah. Okay. We need to get on Mark's level. The number one rule is, you have to
have a heated seat. That's it? - That feeling when you sit down...
- And it is not cold? I agree. You don't need to make billions
to be happy. You just need to be able to afford
a bidet and a heated toilet seat. Cause that's where I spend
most of my time. Well, even though I'm sure Mark
would love to spend more time here on the toilets,
our time here is officially ran out. And so I'll see you guys
at the next house. Up next, we have a house
whose price point happens to be my favorite number. And now we are at the $69 million
mansion. That looks like a villain owns it. It does look villainous. How's this compare to your house, Miranda? It's a lot bigger than mine. That can't be sure.
What's your address? The reason why this weird looking
house can still go on the market for $69 million
is because it's filled to the brim with priceless art and sculptures
sourced from all around the world. Throw up
how much these artworks are worth and we're going to try to guess it.
How much do you think this is worth? I'm going to say 100,000. - What do you think, Miranda?
- I'm going to go with 80. Oh, she has one of these in her house. Yeah. I have the same one. Only you know the actual price. Oh, actually,
this one will be a fun one. I'm going to go with $1,000,000
because it's like right down the opening stairs, so... $450,000 - Very precise.
- Very specific. The $30 million house had a waterpark, a hundred cars. This place just has artwork. Big red sculpture. This room over here,
we promised them 30 times we wouldn't touch what's in it. Come over here. No touching anything, what is it? This is a one of one
fully analog custom home sound system made by the creator of the Walkman,
which was one of the first devices that allowed you to listen to music
while walking. That's an impressive thing
to have under your belt. To have made the Walkman. I don't think you could fit this
under your belt. Let's traverse across the skywalk. Oh, my God. I'm excited. Another reason
this house is built so strange. For example, having to walk across
SkyBridge is to get anywhere is because it's
been meticulously built to be able to withstand
the force of a real tsunami. I mean, you got to admit,
that's pretty cool. You can see the tsunamis before
they hit your house and you stop them. What completes
the view is the neighbor's backyard. You can see all of it. What if the man who lives here
is secretly in love with the person that lives next door? That's his ex girlfriend. It's a Romeo and Juliet. And now that we are done 
checking out the neighbor's house,  it was time to head to our last stop. The final house,
or should I say the $139 million arguably most luxurious house on the
planet Mega-Mansion This massive 36,000 square foot mansion has things
you never see in any other house, from a nightclub to a T-Rex
to an entire robotic car elevator. This place is going to blow your mind
and to make this house tour extra special,
we brought Justin Timberlake. How you guys doing? And this is Justin's house
and he's going to show us around. No. Holy crap! Have you ever seen a view
better than this in your life? - This is gorgeous.
- Yeah, man, you guys really... The CGI is perfect, it looks real. He's like, ""Yeah, maybe it's top 10."" I'll put it top five. It's hard to describe
just how big this mansion really is. It has 12 bedrooms and 17 bathrooms
split across three massive stories, all with a perfect view
of the Los Angeles skyline. I always judge a house
by the kitchen, minimalist kitchen. You judge these things.
How are you feeling? Well, let's keep going. At the end of the tour,
we'll get his opinion on if he would pay $100 million. He has it on standby if he likes it. Straight cash, homie. Everything in this house is built
out of the most expensive materials on the planet. For example, the walls in this room
are constructed entirely out of rare marble, imported straight from Italy. You guys got to get an estimate
or something on how much marble
is actually in this house. I mean, that's a
that's like custom done. Yeah, there's not a single thing
of drywall in this entire house. Drywall? This is a pretty sick chandelier. This chandelier is over $1,000,000. And the ceiling
literally started dipping because it weighs
so many thousands of pounds. It really keeps going. You didn't tell me it was a million.
I was playing with it earlier. There is literally $6 million
of just chandeliers in this house and the rooms on the bottom floor
get even better. There's a whole other house
down here. If you come over here... Dude, this is literally an ice room. - This is where you lock me in?
- No. Please don't. So, what do you do in here? They ran out of room ideas. Probably a 50%
chance we're locked in here because that doesn't have a handle. Oh, no. We're good. That would have been funny if we were His face. Is that a real dinosaur? Now that you know the house has a
dinosaur, are you more apt to buy it? I'm still on the fence. What? Is this a locker room? No one currently owns this house, so they put nametags
of the few people on the planet
that can actually afford it. Warren Buffett's worth like 80 billion,
Ellison's worth, like 50 billion. Bezos Like 100 billion. Chandler, why is your name not up here? All right, let's check out the whips. - Nolan, are you just posing?
- I'll just be sitting here. You really match the house. Thank you. I was going for that, I was going for that. Job well done. Nolan's going to go in the editing room
and clip that. This $2.5 million car elevator is one of the most insane
features in the whole house. You select which car
you want to drive on the tablet, and it literally sends it up
two floors right into the garage. I know what you're thinking. The main problem with
this is it only stores - Six Lamborghinis and...
- Yeah... You needed like a ten car storage. Right. This house also had the by far biggest home theater
I've ever seen in my life. This almost looks
like a real movie theater. This is the best movie
theater so far. And they're actually reclining
chairs. It only costs
100 mil for that. Check it out, Jimmy.
Wait, press my massage button. I got you. Hey! I don't need this Bro, where's my button?
My chair's not even doing that. Here, switch. Let me see. Yeah, Chandler test the massage feature. Oh, my god, it works. No way this is just the only one here. Man. This is great. Bro, what is wrong with them? All right, lead the way upstairs. This is a primary bedroom over here. Oh, and then over here. The bathrooms. In case you've ever
wanted to shower with ten people. Now you can. That's my thing, man. You can take a bath with no one. And basically all yourself
but showering. You can fit an army in there. - If that's what you're into.
- He is. And now the best part of the house
over at the pool. The real reason this house cost
so much. I'm pressing it. Is this a screen? It is absurdly large. And slow. - It gives drama, though.
- It is. Exactly. It gives a dramatic effect. I mean... It's a little bit of a flex. What a gorgeous view of L.A. Yeah. Imagine
this screensaver was L.A. I think it is. There's downtown L.A. and there's downtown L.A. For reference, Karl is
like six foot five. Yeah, something like that.
Give or take And look
how tall the TV is compared to him. All right, Justin,
you've seen the whole house. We need to know. Obviously, you have $100 million
in cash sitting outside. Right. Are you going to buy the house? - Nolan's shirt comes with it.
- You don't like my shirt? - Your shirt comes with it?
- Yeah. I'm in. Does the bear that
ripped up the shirt come with it? Oh, no! Let's go! - Wait, wait.
- Why? I hope you guys enjoyed it I'll see you around. To buy the house you just saw,  check out 1200 Belair in Los Angeles."

if you don't say yes. I'm doing it. Let's go.
Mack may sound confident now, but there are ten more traps
he has to get through if he wants to walk out of this
with $1,000,000. But first, let's see if he can win
200 grand. Welcome to Trap number two. Close the door. Glad we were not under that.
In these duffel bags. It's 200 grand in cash. All you have to do to win it, is press that red button
and go back to this door. What happens when I press the button? Just press it and find out. You wanna come with me? Oh, no. I'm staying,
I'm staying over here. - Come with me.
- Go press the button. In case you forgot 200 grand is on the line. I don't know what's going to happen
when I push the button. Just press the button The dramatic lights. I think you can see what the trap is. If you touch a laser,
the door is going to slam closed. Is there a time limit? There's a touch of the laser
limit and it's one. Bro, imagine if he just hit the first
laser. This is not made for short people dude. Oh my gosh. I had a feeling
he would crawl on the floor. That's why coming up, There's lasers
literally straight in front of him. I don't know how
I'm going to get past those. - I'm gonna be honest.
- Oh, this is crazy. Oh my gosh. Oh, you're like,
surrounded by lasers. Mack, I wouldn't move. Jimmy, if I touch the laser. How long do I have
before that door closes? Less than a second. Take a step to your left. Take a step out of the way. - Okay.
- Thank you. Three, two, one. Oh my gosh. That was so... I'm speechless. Oh, yeah. - Let's go!
- Don't celebrate yet. Do you want to walk away with 200
grand or risk it for 300 grand? I think I want to
do the next one. Let's do it. Unfortunately for Mack,
all of these traps get progressively harder and harder to pass,
especially this next one. Mack, come on in. You're now in trap number three. Bro, look how cool this is. We literally spent the last 60 days
designing this set. This is the $200,000
you've already won. All you have to do here is grab the next hundred thousand dollars,
and then all you got to do is walk down this path and walk
right through this door. What's going to happen
when I grab the money? - Look around.
- It's over your head on this one. Okay. Starting to click for me
a little bit. That was a little too obvious. I'd say as soon as I picked up money that boulder's coming straight for me. And if you get ran over by the
boulder, I take my 300 grand back. Oh, dude I'm going to go over here so I don't get
squished by a boulder. I want you to count me down
for three. Three, two, one. Go! Oh, my God. Go, go, go You got to go. Go, go, go. Back off! Not going to lie You are much faster than I thought. Oh, my gosh. That boulder was right behind him. Are you going to go for a fourth? I don't know, Jim. You're actually getting better. If that thing hit me,
what would happen? Would I die? Well, here's what happened to Nolan
when he got hit. It hurts. - I'm sorry, I just got to...
- Yeah, of course. No, this is a big decision.
You should really think it through. Okay, so what do you do? - Okay, I'll do one more.
- One more? - One more, yeah.
- All right. Let's go see if
he loses 300 grand...  or makes more money. Don't phrase it like that, Jimmy. Mack is now in a ball. How's it feel? I'm realizing
how bad I smell in this ball. You chose this. Open the door. Welcome to trap number four. For this trap, I made a life sized
video game that he has to complete. Oh my gosh, dude. To win 400 grand, all Mack needs to do
is complete this course. In case it's not clear If you fall down there in the foam,
you lose. I see that. Oh, yeah. One more thing. You only have 5 minutes
to complete the course. Okay. First things first. We have these little platforms. Not too crazy. This is so much harder in a ball. Bro, if he's unironically
struggling with this, Wait until he gets to all the moving
platforms of death. This is not going to be easy, Oh my gosh, dude. Jump! Jump? Mack, be careful. 400 grand on the line. Here, can I join you? - Why? why?
- I don't know. - Why?
- I'm sorry. Because I want to be in the video. It's my video. This is terrifying Up to this point, it's been pretty easy. This is where it starts to get difficult. This is where it's difficult? It has not been easy. Oh, this is crazy, dude. Unlike the other challenges. He's actually going pretty quick. Balancing inside of this
ball is harder than it looks. It multiplies all of your movements,
meaning you can fall at any time. This ball is so hard to balance in. Bro, it's 400 grand. It's not supposed to be easy. The obstacle so far in this trap are
nothing compared to the final stage. This is where it gets really hard. I couldn't have been more wrong. Mack literally obliterated the last stage of this course
in 10 seconds. Oh my God! That is what I'm talking about! bro, whenever he wins,
I get afraid to be around him. I don't know what to say when
I sketch this on a piece of paper. It seemed a lot harder. However, the traps that follow this one
are harder than anything we've seen so far. Answer the riddle. What is better than 400 grand? 500 grand? Are you going to be a wuss or
do you want a chance to win $500,000? If the next one is going to be
as easy as this, let's run it back. I didn't say it would,
but I'm going to take that as a yes. Next trap. Which Mack is going to need
a bathing suit for because... It might involve some swimming. Jimmy, what is this? Mack, hop in this water real quick. Mack, do you have
any idea what you're doing? Not really. Okay. This trap is hard, but simple. When I say go, your money will be
pulled towards that massive bonfire.  To stop it
You need to pull that lever. And to get there, you'll have to swim
through this underwater chamber and pick the locks of all four doors
in your path. Got it. You're probably wondering,
why am I holding a clothes hanger? Because that's
how you pick the locks. - Mack, are you ready?
- I'm ready! Three, two. Oh, wait, Mack,
could you fix that thing behind you? All right, the timer has started. This money in exactly 3 minutes,
it's going to be in that fire pit. Unless Mack comes out the other end,
and flips that lever. He's struggling right now. How is he holding his
breath this long? So Mack just unlocked the first lock. You got this, Mack. And while he's competing
for half a million dollars, Half a million dollars just 
casually drifting towards a fire.  Every time Mack unlocks the lock,
he goes deeper and deeper into the water, which means he has less and less time to pick his locks as he has to
come back up to the surface for air. That is so hard to see. Bro, this is crazy. He got the third door open. All right, Mack. One more door. Bye bye. Look how close the money is
to the fire. He is almost done,
I think he just opened the fourth gate. Pull the lever. You got to pull the lever! You just stopped the money! Oh, my gosh. I hate you. You might be a little lightheaded from
the lack of oxygen. I could barely see. I know, see that 500 grand
floating right there? Do you want to risk it for 600 grand? Full transparency. The next trap. It's probably the easiest trap
of all. I'm serious. If you were to ever stop,
I don't think now is when you would want to stop. - All right, let's do it. I'm in.
- Yeah? - Yeah yeah, let's go.
- That could have been a lie. What? I was, in fact, not lying. Anyone with a developed prefrontal cortex should be able to pass this next one. Welcome to the next trap. This, in theory, should be the
easiest 100 grand of your life. Okay, I need you to pick either
a Feastables Bar or a Hershey's bar One needs to go in the trash - There we go!
- Yeah! I will never eat that. - Disgusting!
- Well of course... Cause you just won
a hundred grand. That's right. Now you have $600,000 in cash. - Jimmy that's six lamborghinis
- And a Feastable bar. I'll throw that in. Thanks. Do you want to risk this $600,000 Mini ocean of money For the chance to win $700,000? You're crazy. I can tell he's about to say yes. I don’t know… Dude, my mom is gonna be so mad
at me if I lose this right now. Yes or no? Just one more. What's one more? - All right, let's do it. Yes.
- All right. One more. I actually though. Please do not let me do
one after that. - Okay.
- Okay. Well, where we're going on this next trap, Mack is going to need a blindfold. All right, can you see? I cannot see. That was a lie. All right,
maybe actually two blindfolds. I hope he's not scared of heights. And if you're wondering
why I said up heights earlier... Well... Send us up! Oh, we're going up. No, no, no, no, no. Mack may know that we're going up,
but not how far Oh my God, dude. We're going 200
feet in the air, where he's going to have
to face his biggest fear If he wants to walk away with 700
grand Mack... let's take off the trash can. Heads up! Mack... Welcome to the next trap. I hope you're not afraid of heights. I'm scared, bro. Dude, that looks terrifying. The next trap is simple. All you have to do is walk
to the other side on this absurdly thin balance beam. Okay, this is insane.
Oh, my gosh. I just don't know how
he's going to do this. I'm so scared right now.  I'm so scared. Bro, this is terrifying. - I don't... Would you do this?
- Oh, heck no. I would never do this. 700 grand down the line. His worst fear. Let's see what happens. Okay. I can't think about anymore. It is what it is. There. Oh, he's definitely
at the point of no return. Karl, don't move... Oh my gosh. Holy crap. He’s making it… Oh! No way. Yeah! - Yes!
- Yes! - Yes!
- Oh my God! That's what I'm talking about. That's what I'm talking about, baby. Oh my God, dude. Based on the first couple of steps,
I did not think he was going to make it As requested, I will not try to influence you. Do you want to walk away
with your 700 grand or risk it and keep going for
the million dollars your decision? I have the opportunity right now to
leave with just an insane amount of money. But... I'm just... I'm just so close. I just feel like everyone at home
wants to see the next three challenges,
right? I do. Final answer. I'm going to the next one. Yeah! If he fails the next trap, I'm going to feel terrible. Mack now only has three traps remaining to win $1,000,000,
but it only gets harder from here. You decide to risk the money. - Let's do this.
- I'm so scared. Lights on! This next
trap may look a little familiar Our most viewed video is Squid Game So I thought it would be fun
if we combined the glass bridge game with the cookie cutting game
all into one trap. Just like in Squid Game,
you have a honeycomb here. You have to cut out the shape
that's there and put that exact shape on the scanner. If you break the cookie, it won't fit in the circle
and the bridge will drop you. And I lose everything. But if it's the exact same size,
the door will open and you have to do it three more times How much time to have? There is no time limit. - Thank God.
- No, but you've been... - Thank God! Some of these challenges, he takes an hour. so I might give you one. - No, don't give me a time limit.
- Okay, well, can you just at least start? Okay. A strategy. Jimmy,
is I lick this boy. And that's going to melt the sugar. And then ideally, I can poke this
needle through this cookie. So your strategy is Squid Games. That's the way to put it.
Yeah. - Mack.
- Get away from me. - I didn't touch you.
- You need to stay over there. What about my croc? No. Well, now I don't have a shoe. It's the only way to teach you, man. All right, here we go. It's taking forever. I understand that this money
is essentially meaningless to you. Me? This will change my life. So I'm going to take my sweet time
cutting the circle out. You can take your sweet time.
Take your sweet time Just the next one. I'm probably going put a time limit. No! Halfway done. That's it, right? Okay, put it there. You're good. Light's on. He's going to solve the triangle
pretty easily. But after the triangle is a star
and an umbrella which are way harder. Okay.  Cookie. Also, wait, wait. Before you open it. One second. Oh, no, I'll replace that because the money
was so far away I moved it over here. In case you forgot what you're
competing for. - Part of it's really far away.
- I will replace it. Okay. You can proceed. For the record,
I regret saying yes to this. - Really?
- Yeah. At this point see how sad you are
at the thought of losing? I would actually highly recommend
if you win to walk away after this. That's what I thought after
I finished the high ropes course. That's what you thought after every trap, But yet, we're here. Wow, that's just sliding off. Last piece. Oh my gosh. I think he did it. Okay. Walk on in here. Cookie us. Now comes the real challenge.
Umbrella. The hardest shape. If I win this, I don't think
I should risk it again, dude. All right, how about this? Cut this stupid umbrella out and then
just take the money for my sanity. For my sanity, dude. Okay. Oh, and by the way,
this one has a ten minute timer. - Okay, it's ticking right now?
- Yeah. 9 minutes and 50 seconds
remain. I love you. I will not be speaking to you
while I'm doing this. I completely understand $800,000 is on the line. Give me a dollarbill, like a stack money.
Give it to me. Stack, okay. He's using the money as a hammer. They didn't do that in Squid Game. I've never felt more intensity
in my life. This is very, very difficult. I don't know what I'm going to do
with myself if I lose this. 5 minutes remain. Honestly, I think you can do this. I feel like
I'm going to break it, dude. Shoe hammer Dude, I'm just making no progress. 2 minutes. He's starting to break it off. He's starting to pull pieces of. Just so you know,
there's 60 seconds left Mack. Wait, what just happened? Oh, no. I actually don't know what to say. I'm such an idiot, dude. And I had it all. It's $700,000. I don't know why I did
this. Would it have hurt less
if you just lost the first challenge? So much less. Well, here, come on buddy. Come on. Let's stand up. Let it be known. If you're in a MrBeast video... quit while you're ahead. I'll be honest, guys. This was pretty sad. So I decided to give Mack an extra 100
grand for his troubles. Let me know if you want to see
more videos like this one. Hopefully
the next one has a happier ending. See you later."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrLj6nc516A,"$1 vs $100,000,000 Car!",988,20230916,en,"Behind me are
the most expensive cars in the world. No joke. We got our hands on over $250
million worth of cars, one of them
even costing $100 million. And we're going to be exploding
sailing, driving and even flying all of these cars
to show you why they're so expensive. Starting with this $1 car,
literally a rust bucket. Why are you selling this car
for a dollar? Well,
you see, it's pretty much worthless. And I can't put any time
or money in this thing. If you grab this dollar,
the deal is final. Now, obviously,
this is a piece of garbage, but when you spend 20 K on repairs,
it actually runs. All right, let's get this
bad boy started. I do not think it would start How is this thing driving? It smells like smoke! this is crazy. One dollar car! One dollar car! - One dollar car!
- One dollar car! One dollar car! All right, well, that was the $1 car. Glad I wasn't in that. Bringing the $100,000 car,
which drives itself. No joke. No one is currently in this car,
and it is moving. Let's see what 100 grand gets you. There's a lot of room in this car. This is one of the few cars
that can actually fit all my kids. - Do you have kids?
- Yeah, all of them. Let's take it for a little spin. The real reason you're buying a Tesla
is because it can drive itself. All right. I'm no longer driving the car. Oh, it's switching lanes. Oh, it is literally driving itself. I'm not touching the gas and I'm
not touching the steering wheel. Jimmy, are you telling me now
you can take a nap while driving? - No, don't do that.
- Oh ok. Now, let's see how fast the car goes. It jerks you backwards. That's terrifying. This is just the beginning. Later, we have a car
that literally transforms into an airplane and flies. But now. Oh look that lambo. Oh, I almost hit it. Bro just left the keys in here.
How'd nobody steal it? Even though this cost twice
as much, it has half as much space. I don't know if I take 200k
for this car because I don't fit in it. Did they even know
how to drive a Lamborghini? - How would you do fourth?
- I think you just click the shifter. All right. And now we're on the road. Oh, that sound. Oh my gosh. She sounds angry Hey, she's got some power. Oh, my gosh. This car is insane. I'm barely touching the gas,
and we're flying. This might be the fastest car
I've ever driven. If you need to compensate
for something, this is definitely the car. And now we're at the $300,000 car, and this is supposedly
the safest car on the planet. It's like a tank. Is this a military-grade car? Yeah. This is so high up. You were also just in the Lamborghini. True, true perspective. Let's go over
what makes this car so safe. First things first is the bulletproof
windows that are this thick. The car is also encased
in explosive proof armor that we're going to put to the test
later on. - Karl, do you want to press the button?
- So bad. - You want to hit the smokescreen button?
- Please? That is crazy. We have a literal smokescreen. Oh, my gosh, It smells. But the best part is
none of these features are what makes the car really safe. It's the little explosive proof
frame around the car. And we're going to be
the first people to test it. And for reference,
before we blow up the $300,000 car, we're going to blow up on normal cars
to see if the passengers survive. Three, two, one. Not only is it on fire,
but the mannequins literally flew out of the car. We blew a sunroof
into that thing. It doesn't handle it well at all. And before we blow up this car,
I'm going to put feastables inside Better protect my freaking chocolate. So supposedly this car is explosion
proof, but that's never been tested. Let's see if the mannequins and even more importantly,
the Feastables survive. Three, two, one. It just jumped. The car survived the blast
with only a few minor scrapes. It put a dent in the window.
Wait. Hold on, hold on. Where are the feastables? Chandler,
get out the way. The feastables survive. If you're looking for a car
that can take a bomb, I officially recommend this one. But since you're not going to war
anytime soon for only an extra $200,000, you could get this
$500,000 boat car. On land this is a normal car. You can't really tell the difference.
But here's the fun part. Just drive it in the water
and it turns into a boat. We'll let Karl go first. - Here we go.
- Oh, this doesn't feel right. This doesn't feel right. I'm having them go first
just so I can make sure it works. Are we sinking, no we are floating! Oh, it looks like it
worked. Let's see what happens. Oh, my God. We're driving in the water. Oh, so you press
this until you hear a beep. That's a beep. Now, I should be able to drive this
like a normal car, but on the water. Thea hold on. This is incredible. This was literally a car five seconds ago. Yeah! I would be out there with them,
but I get carsick and boat sick. Oh, hey there.  Oh my God. All right, Karl! Karl! They should not have let me drive this We got it baby. Rule number one,
stay really far away from Kris. We're driving in circles. Oh, they're doing donuts
in the water, they're making a whirlpool. I just met this guy 5 seconds ago. We're going to race three, two, one. Go! He is so much faster. He's not even trying.
Come on. Faster. Oh, we're destroying him. - He's slowing down.
- I can't believe we just beat him. This thing goes way too fast. I can't think of a better way
to celebrate a win than a Feastables Bar. Hey, have some feastables. I got it. Feastables the number one
chocolate on the planet. If you're not eating it,
you should fix that. The fact that all three of us are driving
cars on the ocean is insane. Jimmy, I love this thing so much. The craziest part is this is just
the beginning of this video. The next car on our list
can literally fly. And since I'm afraid of heights, I'll
let Karl and Nolan take this one. Dude, what is happening? This car is not only completely
street legal, but it also has wings that can take it to literally 8000 feet in the sky. There's literally a propeller on that car. Stay here and watch it take off. I'm going to go
in that plane and follow it. I just don't believe
this is actually going to fly It's taking off! The wheels aren't on the ground anymore. It's literally a car that's flying. These cars are getting crazier and crazier. I can't even believe my eyes. There is a car
a mile above my head right now. Oh, this so cool. I feel like for $600,000,
this is a steal. Prepare for landing. Up next is the $1 million car. But I didn't only bring one up. As you can imagine, there's
a lot of $1 million cars out there. So to make sure
I brought your favorite, we got the ten coolest
$1 million cars. And as per usual, we have the entire
racetrack to ourselves. So I let my friends choose
whatever car they wanted. I'm going to ride with you.
You pick. Look at this baby. Am I going to fit in this? All right.
I'll try not to text and drive. It's private property.
It's technically legal here. Oh, here we go. We're never going to die. Don't jinx it. I feel like I'm in NASCAR. I'm having so much fun.
This feels like Fast & Furious. There's just something so masculine
about driving over priced loud cars. On a private racetrack. On a private racetrack. Hold on.
I got to send a text. No, I'm kidding. - I'm crashing this.
- Please no. Karl! Oh, my God. We're doing donuts in a million dollar car. While the gang is whizzing
around the track, I want to show you the next car. This $2 million limited edition
hydrogen car. No joke. This car is completely powered
by hydrogen and actually exhales drinkable water as exhaust,
but the car still being developed. So this is just a prototype. I don't think I've ever struggled
this much to get in a car. All right.
Let's see how she closes. First impressions, door kind of slow. We're about to turn on the road. This is a really big deal
because this car has never been driven
on a road before. Oh, you should have told me before
I got here. They built this car
as a proof of concept. So driving on the road
is questionable. Well, look at that lady over there. That person over
there is literally filming our car. And while we're driving,
I want to tell you about the Samsung Galaxy
Z Flip 5 phone. And what's special about this phone
is it literally folds in half. Boom, half the size. Also, I'd wear a seat belt,
but it doesn't have they haven't gone that far yet. Folding screen on the flip
five makes the phone fit in your pocket better and also allows you to use
two apps at the same time. - Show them.
- Let me show you. On the bottom half
of the phone, I have Google and on the top half We're watching a MrBeast video. Oh, snap. - Bro, this boy gets up there.
- Yeah. Even though this car uses hydrogen
instead of gas, it still has a range of over a thousand miles,
top speed of 221 miles per hour. And another cool thing about this
phone is it can record in 4K 60 fps. You can even record while it's folded. In fact The Samsung Galaxy s23 Ultra
is the official vlog camera of the channel. Listen to that engine. - What?
- That's such a cool sound. It literally has a front facing
camera even when you close it down. The Flip5 is the most innovative
phone Samsung has ever made. Click the link in the description
to get one right now. Do it. There's a lot of cars around me
and everywhere. Get away from my $2 million car. I'll see you at the next car. Back at the racetrack, we have
the most exotic and powerful car yet. Costing $10 million. This Koenigsegg Vader
is the only one in existence. So this is the world's
fastest production car. Oh, my gosh. And with literal crushed
diamonds in the paint, the insurance companies
only let the owner drive. That's probably the coolest door
I've ever seen in my life. You're crazy. - All right, let's do this.
- Let's do it. Fun fact, I made
a grown man cry. - Really?
- Yeah. I scared the crap out of him. I'm going to put my head back
so I don't get whiplash. How was it so fast? I've never... Watch out for that. The reason this car is one of the fastest on the planet is because of its twin
turbocharged V8 engine and the fact that its entire frame
is made out of air core carbon fiber, making it weigh
almost 500 pounds less than a Lamborghini. I've never witnessed
anything like this before. It's like riding in a roller coaster. My heart is pounding. Well, that was awesome.
Thank you, sir. Thank you. Let's go hang out with Jay Leno and see what a $20 million car
looks like. All right. Jay Leno was the king of The Tonight
Show for over 20 years. Today, he's the proud owner
of one of the most impressive car collections in the world,
including this $20 million McLaren F1. Did it just start doing that
because of you? It's high tech. Robbers don't try that. And what makes it so valuable? It's a V12 carbon fiber. It's extremely light. And it was 241 miles an hour, which is still the fastest for
a non turbocharged non supercharged car. I'll show you something kind of cool. It got three seats,
as you can see. The car is about 2300 pounds. Your most modern cars are 4,000. It's more comparable
to Nolan's mom than another car. That's right. Exactly. In fact, Nolan's mom was really
the one they used as the benchmark. - You guys want to go for a ride?
- Of course. There's no way to get in that middle seat.
 It's actually uncomfortable. Oh, it's not bad. Yeah, it's not bad.
Did not look bad at all. It's comfortable. It's oddly comfortable
to have three seats like this. Yeah, it is pretty interesting, Normally this is where
the wheel would be. Or if you were in England. this is where the steering wheel would be. You can be in England,
you can be in America. How long have you had this car? - What year were you born?
- 1998. Actually, I got this in 98. I popped out of my mom and he's like,
""let's celebrate by buying this car."" Here's the second part. I'm your dad. Interesting. How much did you buy this for? I paid 800,000, and I bought it. And people thought
you'll never get your money back. But then it just went up
and up and up and up. And now there's $20 million,
you know? So it's crazy. This car basically made you
a millon dollars a year every year. I guess that's fair to say. Karl, what do you think of the car? I like it. What's stopping you from buying one $19.9 million? Have you ever had a wreck? Oh, yeah. I've had a lot of wrecks. Thank you so much for taking us out. No problem, guys. That was perfect. These next two cars are so expensive,
that they are literally locked away in a museum at all times. Combined, they cost $80 million. And somehow we convinced the museum
to give us the cars. Looking good. And this is where the video gets
literally mind blowing. Crank this bad boy up. That's 30 miller. Let's hear that 50 miller. Not going to lie. I like the
$50 miller one a little better. So I jumped in the $50 million car
with Donut Media and Chandler got in the $30 million car
with Beau Boeckmann, the car legend. You ready? - Are you ready?
- I'm ready. Let's do this. The reason the car
that Chandler's in is so expensive is because it was specifically
constructed as a gift from the founder of Ferrari
to the founder of Ford. This is the only version of this
Ferrari ever made in human history. Watch out for this bump. No scraping. You don't really notice
how, like, crappy the street is until you drive
something that's $50 million. The car we're in is the most
expensive Jaguar in existence. It was the legendary actor
Steve McQueen's daily driver, and he got so many speeding tickets
driving it, his license was actually suspended. I'm noticing
every single pothole now. And because these cars
are so expensive, we have an entire police escort
dedicated to making sure nobody comes close to the cars. This is insane. Hey, get some speed. - How's it drive?
- Beautifully. Oh my hat! Oh well. While we were all having fun,
Beau Boeckmann pushed this $30 million car to its absolute limit. Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Hold on. The car is stuck. Hold on one second. We hit it too... too hard. The $30 million car stalled. We're going to hop out of
these things before we break them. Let's go drive the $100
million world's first Ferrari. Most people would imagine
$100 million car would look something more like this. But you'd be surprised to find out
that this is the $100 million car. This car is so historic and valuable
that this museum representative is the only person on earth
allowed to drive it. It's only allowed to be driven
on this bridge. We had cops completely closed
the roads. We even had street cleaners
fill in every pothole and clean the entire street to ensure  that nothing damages this $100 Million car. This is going to be crazy. All right.
And now we're on the bridge. Oh, my God. Look at that. $100 million
barreling down the street. Oh, I keep
losing my hat. He lost his hat. That's the second time. Most expensive
car comes with a free hat. Come on. Come on! This is awesome. Name one thing more fun than this. All right. Floor it. Let's go. Oh, my God. It's awesome.  I hope you guys enjoyed the video Let's drop a nuke on the bridge. Subscribe to get Nolan’s mom a treadmill.
Just kidding we love you nolan’s mom"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBpQ1SlfVtU,Lamborghini Vs World's Largest Shredder,898,20230902,en,"This is the largest shredder
in the world, and this Lamborghini
is going to fall in it. We're also nuking
an entire life size village, shooting real tanks
at a literal Lamborghini, and crushing this store
with the world's largest domino. This is the first
of many experiments. You're going to love this video.
You ready? - Ready!
- This is going to be crazy. All right.
They're falling. Come on. All right, it's working. It's actually working. Are we going to have to run? You hear the thud? Oh, it's going. All right, that was the tallest
domino in the world. That was the new tallest domino
in the world. Down goes the domino! Oh, my God! That was insane! - That was crazy!
- We were way too close! This isn't even the coolest thing
we're doing in this video. We're detonating the biggest
explosion in YouTube history, launching a rollercoaster
off its track, and so much more! Let's go to the next experiment. We got a lot of experiments today. And up next, we're going to destroy
an entire village with a massive creeper explosion. And just for reference, a human sized version
looks like this. - Oh!
- Oh, okay. But we're going to be detonating
one 50 times bigger Steve, somehow you survived
the last creeper. This one… I'm not quite sure
you're going to survive. We don't believe Steve's
going to make it? Oh, heck no. Even though this is 50 times bigger,
it has 200 times the TNT. Bye, Steve. - Okay, let's head in the bunker.
- All right, Steve. Let's send Steve into the abyss. Just so you know
how big this creeper is, Steve is actually taller than me. - He's getting close.
- We're in the Green Zone. This is going to be
a massive explosion. It's getting closer, any second now. I don't know
when it's going to happen. Oh, I'm scared. Oh, my gosh. - Oh, my God.
- I'm speechless, for once. I'm still processing that. - That was insane.
- How are we allowed to do this? - We live in a country called America.
- Go, America. If you thought that was cool,
I got news for you. It's about to get a whole lot cooler.
For our next experiment, I bought another Lamborghini. - Adam, this is your Lamborghini.
- Thank you. And you're probably wondering,
though, what's the catch? Yes. That's exactly
what I'm wondering. How do I put this? Recently, I may have obtained
a military grade tank. In exactly three days, I'm going to be raining
missiles on your new car. And you get to use my credit card to spend as much money
as you want trying to defend it. If the Lamborghini survives,
you have a brand-new car. I'm going to spend whatever
it takes to defend this Lambo. That's why I gave you my card. Okay, fine. I'm going to do it. A lot of things racing
in my mind right now, but it's simplified into Stop Shell,
win Lambo. Adam's first move was to call
a construction crew to bring in building materials
and help him set up his first wall. I'm going to want all the walls
to kind of be a foot over my head. That'll at least protect
the direct shots on the Lambo. Now for the second part of my process,
it's going to be the pool. There was a MythBusters episode where they were
shooting rounds into a pool, so that should stop
the velocity heavily. Adams got a lot of work ahead of him
to keep his Lambo from danger. And speaking of danger, we bought the world's
most dangerous roller coaster. And if you're
wondering why it's dangerous… Basically, I put bombs on the ride. In theory, if you were to ride
this roller coaster, you should get launched off this rail. The only question is
where would you land? Let's see how far it goes
when it gets launched off it. And obviously, before we launch it,
we're going to put mannequins on it. Everyone, put your mannequin
where you want. He's got a good head on his shoulders. And the final touch. Push! As hard as you can! - All right, get out of the way.
- Go! Go! Go! All right, there it is. This thing's going fast. All right. Now, it's going
to come down and go off the ramp. Here it goes. Go, go, go. All right.
Hold up, hold up, hold up. Oh, that actually scared me. To be honest,
I thought it would go further. That was cool and all. Let's do that again. but with an explosive in the cart. Inside these boxes,
there's dozens of pounds of TNT. When we're done pushing,
run to the bunker. You don't have to tell me to do that. Go, go, go, go. We're going. All right, I'm running. Go, guys. Go! - Go quicker.
- Go, go, go, go, go! Oh, my Gosh! - Get inside.
- It's going down! That was awesome! It might not have flown 100 feet,
but at least we blew it up. But that explosion
is literally nothing compared to what you're
about to see. For the next experiment,
we have three safes, one that costs $1,000, $10,000, and finally, the $100,000 safe. It's bigger than me. And we're going to see
how many explosives they can resist. These are actual explosives. Why is Chandler bringing them in? He's my dealer. - Okay.
- Carefully set it down. I know this doesn't look like a lot,
but this is $1,000. For however much
we spent on each safe, we spent the same amount on TNT. And we're going to see who wins
this $1,000 safe or $1,000 in explosives. I'm going to put an egg
inside the safe. Let's see if it turns
into scrambled eggs. Usually during explosives,
we have a wireless switch. This time, it's hardwired. Why? That actually scared me. Well, the egg in the safe
literally don't exist anymore. Let's try this again with 10 times the explosives
and a safe 50 times stronger. No joke, this thing has three-inch-thick steel. Grab a crate of explosives. This is like explosive Jenga. Oh, my gosh. We're like putting presents
around a Christmas tree. The last egg did not survive. Let's see if a $10,000 safe
can protect it. Is this safe
really worth ten grand if it can't protect an egg from TNT? I don't know
if safes are meant to stop TNT. - This button is hot.
- You want to hit it? I do. 3, 2, 1, go! Oh! - What? Oh, my…
- Bro. The next one is supposed
to be 10 times bigger. Than that one, which was ten times
bigger than the previous one. Oh, my God.
He put a divot in the ground. Yo, can you guys believe Nolan's
mom fell right here? Oh, my God. It broke the glass
on the hundred thousand safe. In hindsight, I should've
put the safes further apart. Ever since we were born,
we've always wondered if you put $100,000 worth
of explosives around $100,000 safe, would it protect an egg? The age-old question. You're in luck
because I'm about to answer it. So heavy! This safe is now surrounded
by $100,000 in explosives? You could say it's unsafe now. Out of every explosion
we've ever done, what you're about to see
is the biggest by far.  Our videos have gone so crazy
that people think we fake them. This is a real explosion. Three, two, one. I don't even have any words. - We woke up everybody in the city.
- Everybody in the entire state. Let's see if the egg survived.
Oh, my gosh. Bro, the back of the safe is gone. Bro, it broke the foundation. It's all cracked in the floor. It seems like they
put all their effort in the 37,000 pound door
and not the walls of the safe. And the egg did not survive. If you ever want to rob a bank, just buy a hundred grand worth of TNT. in the meantime, Adam had been going
all night building his structure. It's like 2:00 a.m.,
still so hot out here. And when I came back in the morning, I noticed he had some
pretty interesting ideas for it. Adam!
What am I looking at? Scrapyard had a lot of cars, I'm going to have at least
two layers of cars and I'm probably going to stack them. The real secret is I'm going to be
using the engine block to stop it, That should give it
more stopping power than just the side of a vehicle. So far, Adam has
two cinder block walls, two layers of stacked cars
and three pools full of water, all just to protect
this Lamborghini from the tank's shot. What do you think the odds are
that the Lambo survives? That Lambo's mine, baby.
We're going to get it done. But I wasn't about to go easy on it, so we brought in extra support
for tomorrow. Boys! Bring them in! Oh, my gosh. Jimmy. Now that we brought in two more tanks,  the Lambo will be
targeted from all sides. Adam doesn't stand a chance. You have a little less
than 24 hours left. Good luck, Adam. You're going to need it. All jokes aside,
I am actually stressed out about that If I'd known there were
going to be three tanks, I would've strategized
completely different. While you're building,
we're going to go test the tanks. Oh, great. Thanks. Kris. Do you want to do the honors? - Yeah.
- Too bad. The test we built consists
of a hundred pound safe, a trampoline
and bulletproof glass. But… Did it go through it? Oh, I can literally see through it
from back here. This is the weakest
of the three tanks. Adam is screwed. While Adam was wrapping up
his protection for his Lamborghini, we're going to throw one
into a shredder. And to show you
how powerful it is, I'm going to shred
some other stuff first. - Karl, send it.
- Here we go! Yeah. Let's see what happens. Oh, yeah! That is so awesome! That doesn't sound like piano noises. Yeah! I think we need to wash down
that piano. I agree.
Send the coke. I'm 99% sure these are going
to blow up. Oh, there it goes! And while we're doing this, I want to tell you guys
about Creator League. It's a gaming league brought to you
by eFuse and eight of the biggest
gaming entertainers in the world. It's like having a front row
season ticket, but you're not just watching. You're actively drafting teams, changing strategies
and sharing in the reward. Oh, my God. Up next, we have
a Hershey's vending machine. I'll do you guys a favor
by getting rid of it. There it goes. There goes the Hershey's. Is it stuck? Turns out not even this
massive shredder can digest Hershey's. When you purchase
a Creator League pass, you're able to influence the league, compete at weekly tournaments,
win prizes, and potentially even meet
some of your favorite influencers. And if you sign up in
the next seven days, you'll receive a free box
of Feastables. I'm grabbing the porta potty. Who taught Kris how to use this stuff? Creator League gives you full control
over what games creators play. Kris, drop it! Who's on each team, What are the rules,
and so much more. Oh, it smells. We've been in this junkyard
for 10 hours, and even I took a
poop in that earlier. One Creator pass equals
one vote, and you have full influence over almost everything
they do in the league. Click the link in the description
down below and sign up for Creator League
right now. while we clean out this shredder
to get it ready for the Lamborghini, we're going to go shoot
another one with tanks. And things aren't looking good
for Adam. because he was running
into a ton of problems on his last night of filming. We're hitting some issues.
We need some things. Nothing's open, not being able
to get enough resources. This is my last bricks. I can't believe we even
got these done. three tanks is just impossible. I got to work through
the rest of the night. I wouldn't forgive myself
if I went to sleep now. Adam. Hi, Jimmy. Please tell me
you're not still building. Can I get five more hours? Over the last 24 hours. Adam has managed
to stash 20 more cars, build four more walls to the sides, and he also put two more giant pools. But you went out of your way
to build this pool, but didn't fill it up. Yup. I ran out of time to fill it up. You should learn time management. Yes, I should. Noticing a lot less cars over here. Yeah. Oh, I see you put sand in here. Does it make it harder to push over? It'll be fine, Bro, do you just not want the Lambo? It's going to work. Okay. This might be the last time
we see this Lamborghini in one piece. Stay strong. I'll be back soon. And I've obtained 20 real tank shells. Don't ask me how. And we're not going to stop firing
until we use all of them. The boys are loading the tanks. This is going to be awesome. - Why is mine so small?
- You know why. The moment of truth. Are you ready? Three, two, one. Oh. One of my pools. We got a pool. No, no, no. Our first shot literally
hit the pool in front of the Lambo. The water poured everywhere. How much water did you put in those pools? Oh, this is gross. Fire in the hole! Oh, my God. I'm still holding out faith. Hey, this one at the same time. - All three.
- Oh, my God. Three, two, one. Adam's walls make it impossible
to see the Lamborghini from here. So until we run out of ammo, we have no idea if
his car made it or not. - I felt that one.
- Yeah, this is not good. Reload the tanks. Kris. Karl. Nolan. Your defense is not holding up there. This is not good. I'm kind of grasping the straws
at this point. I've done all I can do. Fire in the hole. I have way too much power. I was so confident today too. I love how is just rapid-fire tanks
right now. My only hope is that they're missing. Anyways, what were you saying?
Last shot. Adam, this time
you don't get a choice. - You have to pull.
- If Imma go down, Imma go down looking like a G. All right. Oh, he's running! Adam's car, it's done for. I can't see. I can't see. Let's go! Come on! Wait. Are there no holes in it? - Man, let's go baby!
- You did it! What's crazy is, even though the cars aren't strong enough
to stop the rounds, they were able to deflect them away from the Lamborghini. - There's a bullet in the pool.
- Oh, my God. There's a bullet in the pool. The pool right
in front of the Lamborghini, caught a bullet for you. Thank you, MythBusters. I owe you this,
but Imma keep the Lambo. Oh, my gosh. Oh, will he fit? Hey, he fits! Hey, we're gonna make it work. That's fine.
We're gonna make it work. Congratulations on the Lambo. Let's go shred another one. And now, the moment you savages
have been waiting for. This hunk of metal is going
in the world's largest shredder. - Is it time?
- It's time! Let's drop it. Karl, are you ready? - Ready!
- Send the Lamborghini! This suspense is killing me. - Oh, my God.
- It's hanging over the edge! Oh, my God! There it goes. Lamborghini versus
the world's largest shredder. It's about to... Oh! Yeah! Look at it.
It looks like it's dancing. This is the coolest
thing I've ever seen Bro, our building's shaking. Oh. The car's fighting back. I think we need to push it down. It's stuck in the Lamborghini tires, so the crane's going to push it down. Whoa. Yeah! Shred the car. Shred the car. It's doing it. Oh, my God. All right. And that is what a shredded
Lamborghini looks like. Don't worry, it didn't work.
It was decommissioned. Subscribe, because we have
some insane videos coming up, and I'd hate for you
to miss them. See you later."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_z-W4UVHkw,"Every Country On Earth Fights For $250,000!",1092,20230819,en,"Behind me is one person
from every country on Earth. We're going to see
which country is the best because I flew all of them here to compete in the most extreme
version of the Olympics ever created. We have track archery, gymnastics, soccer and fencing,
but only one country is going to walk away with this
$250,000 gold medal. Are you ready for the first event? You have 30 seconds
to get across these three hurdles that get bigger and bigger before
this giant wall closes you out. All right, here we go. Three, two, one, go! The first challenge
of the Beast Olympics has begun. Hurry!
You got to run faster than that. Oh, they're sprinting. This is insanity. The wall is closing fast. You better hurry. Bro, look at it.
They're like zombies. Looks like an army of people. First place! Look at first place! He made that look easy. We got one!
Indonesia got in first place. Let's go! They're competing
for this gold medal. Move! Move! Hurry up.
The wall is closing! You got to jump. There's only 8 seconds left.
Move! The walls are almost closed.
Hurry up! You guys are all one step
closer to this gold medal. Let's go, USA. Indonesia baby, you already know. Let's go!
We made it, baby! Over half the countries
were eliminated in the first game and 97 are moving on. Come on in. You guys have no idea
what you're in for. I want you all to remember
you're representing your country. Let's reveal the next event. Good luck, everybody.
You're going to need it. Our next event might be
the craziest set we've ever built. Welcome to Gymnastics! Of death. Send the contestants up. Each round includes 10 countries and only the first five people
to make it to this middle platform move on. I don't care
if it's the five four over here. Or if it's two from there
and three from here. Only five are moving on. Five, four... skip a few, go! Go, go, go, go, go, go. Oh, they got some speed. Syria flying through the course! Come on. You can do it. I believe in you. Oh, no. I believe in you. Syria! Jump! Jump! We got our first place! Let's go! Oh, my God! We got our second one! ¡Vamos! ¡Vamos! Mongolia! You got to pass up or you're out. You got it. Oh, my God. Mongolia! Come on! Let's go! Iraq! Just jump over! Iraq, bro. Don't let him hold you up! Oh, wait. Go, Iraq! Go, go, go, go! Oh, my God, he's stepping on him! Algeria! There we go! Let's go, baby! Bring up the next group. And the beauty of this challenge is we let the contestants
pick what order they jump in. Listen, you guys must decide
who's going last. No, no. You're not going first. You want to sneak, sneak. I'm telling you,
I'm going to make go down. It's a competition. Okay, great. Go! Come on, come on! Oh, my God. Oh, boy. Don't wait for him. Come on! You got to go. Go. Bro, they're stepping over his body. Bro, they're literally stepping
over everything. Hey! We got our first finisher. Get up! Dude! This is bonkers. Only three spots left. There's two spots left. My guy! Come on, Philippines. Go! Take it slow. Just take it slow. Oh. Hey, Argentina!
I don't know if this helps, but there's one spot left and you're the only one
still competing, so... So, fight for it! Fight, fight, fight. Yes! For Messi! Messi! Of the ten people, only four made it to the middle. That is crazy. After our second game, things got a little crazy. Oh no, America! Oh, my God. - America is out!
- America! Whoa! Is he going to be in? Oh, we lost somebody! I'm sorry. We already have five. If you could just,
you know, just do that. I'm sorry. And now it's
time for our final round. Gentlemen,
let me give you one piece of advice. Come a little closer. Don't fall down there. Hey, that's a good advice. Go! All right, slow start. All right. Ah, yeah. Oh, oh, oh. Go, go, go, go. Fiji, go. Not very graceful. He's still there, though. - There you go.
- You got it, Samoa. Now you can walk. Yes! Yes! Do it for your country. - Fiji. Do it for the water.
- Fiji, yes! Oh, no. Let it go, my man. All right, Samoa. There we go. Alright! Two spots! Come on, Papua! Come on! There we go! Let's go! And the final five! We lost another 50 people during gymnastics and are
down to our last 47 countries. Welcome, boys and one girl. In this challenge,
each contestant gets a bow and arrow. And if they can hit this target
from this platform, they move on. And to make this interesting, I'm going to have
you all place one vote to make this event more difficult
for a country of your choice. And for every vote they receive,
the target gets pushed back ten feet. My country doesn't like
Israel lowkey. A lot of people
don't like them, so... I don't like them. Germany. You have a history
of trying to conquer everything. While votes were cast for countries
from all over. One country stood out from the rest. - Who are you voting for?
- Indonesia. I think Indonesia
is the biggest threat. Really? I don't like Indonesia. He hit Indonesia
with a smiley face too. I'm starting to see a theme here. You see him last round?
He was crazy. What is that? Indonesia. Did you draw the country? I drew what I thought
was the country. All right. Now, first is Guam.
Come on up. How many votes do you think you got? Think I got maybe three? - Yeah, three votes.
- Three? Wow. You got three.
How do you know? I go to the gym.
I'm fit and I'm agile. This is your first time
with a bow and arrow? Oh. That was not very promising.
Guam. Guam! Guam! Guam! Little short. Any last words? I love you too. Monaco. You got six votes. Ooh, la la. Bro's got great hair. Thank you, sir. Does great hair
translate into great shots? Oh, come on. Monaco! The prince will be proud. All right. Yeah. - Are you nervous?
- No, not at all. If I lost this one,
I'll be super upset. Oh, no!
We need that. Robin Hood is here! Do me a favor. Feel free to miss. You'll just lose a $250,000 bet. - Anything you want to say?
- Thanks for the opportunity. Maybe next time. For my Pacific people. Azerbaijan. Come on up!
Believe in yourself. Bro, what the... Do you want Feastable bar
before you shoot it? These are Deez Nutz flavor. Actually, that's my favorite. That's a good chocolate. - Yeah!
- He did it for Feastables! I did it! Yeah! Are you nervous? It's far, but it's not too far. - I feel like I got it.
- Saudi Arabia. You're the only girl remaining, and the bow
is literally taller than you. Yeah. That was so close. All right, Indonesia,
you got 12 votes. Move that jump back
as far as she goes. You were the first person
to finish the first round. One of the fastest
to finish the second round. - You should've seen this coming.
- Yeah, I know. This is the farthest
shot of the day by far. - What do you think of it?
- Not far enough. - Not far enough.
- I'm kidding. Wish me luck. Wish me luck. No, it was just left. No! You got the height,
just to the left. I'm so sorry, Indonesians.
I tried my best. I promise I was too big of a threat. And with that last elimination, we are down to only
16 countries remaining. Contestants. Come on in. Come on in. Congratulations
for making it this far. And before we do the next event,
I have an offer. Give each of them
a briefcase with ten grand. That's ten grand. If you want,
you can walk away with ten grand. If not, you could throw it in the pit
and compete in the next event. So, it's very simple. Oh, we already got a couple. It's a lot of money. Here's the thing. Half of you
are about to get eliminated. This is your only chance
to walk away with ten grand. That's a lot of money, but I'm pretty confident
I might win this. I came here to win, I'm gonna make everybody that's here. He looks like somebody
that's going to settle, bro? - I'll take it.
- You wanna take it? Yeah. One person took it. - Smartest man here.
- Last one. - Fiji, you taking it?
- Yes, sir. Yeah, Fiji! Fiji and Italy.
And now it's time for fencing. We let the top finishers from track
choose their opponents. Each pair will compete in a 1v1
game of fencing. The first person to hit
the other wins. Liberia.
Choose your fencing opponent. I'll go Moldova. Moldova, go over there
and stand beside Liberia. Eritrea. Who do you want to go up against? - The last person.
- Luxembourg. All right, come on over.
We're starting wars over here. I'm with Tajikistan. Tajkistan. Okay. - Madagascar.
- Madagascar. - Slovenia.
- Hey. You and I, buddy. Azerbaijan. First off, Samoa versus Azerbaijan. I'm super pumped to bring home
the gold for Samoa. I'm not too nervous, actually. Oh, boy. One of you will move on to compete for this
and the loser will fall in the void. Begin! Someone's got to lunge. Oh, man. - Samoa won!
- Yes! And in case you're wondering,
the suits they're wearing,
it's rigged with technology that will tell us
exactly who gets hit first. This is the same stuff
they use in the real Olympics. Make it, man. Make it, man. Azerbaijan, please stand
in front and center. You've been eliminated. Next up, Iraq versus Madagascar. Begin! Everything's on the line. Let's see it, Iraq. It feels so weird to name people
by their country. Oh, well, no, nothing so far. - This is intense.
- I know. Iraq won! Let's go! Well deserved, bro. I love you, man. I'm sorry. - I love you.
- Madagascar. You are eliminated. Slovenia versus Monaco. - Begin!
- Oh, Monaco running in. And while they're fighting. Oh, oh. I want to tell you guys
about Stumble Guys, a free to play multiplayer game where 32 people compete
to see who wins it all. - Oh, my God.
- How did none of that hit him? If you're going to download
Stumble Guys, you need to act quickly because for the next 30 days,
everyone who downloads it gets our Mr. Beast
gold skin for free. Oh, no, hit. Win! I tried my best for Monaco,
but it is what it is. Next up, Moldova versus Liberia. Begin! In Stumble Guys you can play by yourself
or play with your friends from anywhere around the world. He's getting backed up.
Kris, watch out, Kris. We have a new Mr. Beast skin,

Libya versus Montenegro. They will be fighting over
what they're competing for. Oh, I wish you the best of luck,
but no mercy. Begin! - Don't trip on the medal.
- Trip on the medal, it's funny. It's fine we step here, right? What? Come here. Come here. He's saying come and get some. That focus. Oh, and the winner is Libya. Libya is moving on.
Montenegro, I'm sorry. It's a pleasure to fight you. Drop him. And with that, I'm going to grab the gold medal
and we're off to the final event. So far, you've seen people
from every country compete in track, gymnastics, archery, fencing, and now it's time
for the final event, penalty kicks. The rules are simple. You kick the ball into the goal
and you move on to the next round. But if you miss, you're out. The seven countries
remaining are Slovenia, Moldova, Tajikistan, Eritrea,
Libya, Iraq, and Samoa. I kept thinking in my head, great. Like I gave up a $10,000 suitcase. I trusted myself.
I believe in myself and I did it. Just want to say
there were some doubters in here because of my age. But you know what? Don't judge a book by its cover. I'm doing this for Iraq. Let's go! I'm trying to win for my wife. Bring out the contestants.
Come on in. Just a reminder, one of you is about to receive
this $250,000 gold medal. Who wants to kick first? I'll kick. Okay, Slovenia is up first. This should be easy. I'd be shocked if he missed it. Yeah! Sure, the first round was easy, but that's not going to last
very long. Now that everyone made a goal. - Do you know what's happening?
- I know what's happening. Chandler, bring it on out! The real challenge starts now. It's about to get a lot harder. I think this is where
we'll lose our first person. - That's too tight.
- So much on the line. I thought it was going to be easy. It's only like six foot wide. Someone's getting out. Come on, Slovenia! Hype them up, everybody! Even though we made the goal smaller,
they were still scoring. We're going to have
to make this much more difficult. Nobody's missing. Eventually, someone's got to miss. - Oh, no!
- The first miss. I'm sorry, man.
But you're eliminated. That hurts. I don't know where he ran to. And now only six remain. Instead of adding more walls, we're just going to move
them like this a little bit. It needs to be one Chandler wide. All right.
Slovenia, you're up. - Yeah.
- Wow. The heat just doesn't stop. Take your time. They're dropping like flies. I could have done better, but it was the best five days of my life. This is getting harder now. Yeah, this is a competition. And now only five remain. I'm going to win you! Yeah, baby! All right, Samoa. You're up. It could all come down to this. The fans think it's Samoa. Samoa! Samoa! It hit the X. Obviously, it's disappointing not to be able to win,
but it was phenomenal. I think I did my people proud. I'm sorry, man. Every country on the planet
has competed in these games. And we're now on our final two,
Libya and Slovenia. One of you is going to walk away
with this $250,000 gold medal. Jimmy is going to do a plot twist. It's a big one. Boys, can you remove the walls? Instead of walls You each are going to take turns
being goalkeepers. Yes. We go until someone scores
and someone doesn't. - Pretty simple.
- I'm going to catch it. I'm nervous. - That faked me out.
- That faked me out. He's ice cold. Well, after that,
now he has to make it. - He blocked it!
- Yeah! Yeah! If you make this shot,
you officially win our Olympics. I can't believe this. All you have to do is make the shot
and you've won. I'm going to win. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yes, I win! It's 20 pounds be careful. The golden medal.
I can't believe this. You can probably sell this
for $250,000 tomorrow. And Slovenia gets silver. - Silver is my color, though.
- Congratulations! Amazing! And that's it for first Olympics. Not only did they get these medals, but everyone who competed got $2,000. I hope you enjoyed.
See you in the next video. This is for Libya!"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jObOjhUkf50,"$1 vs $250,000 Vacation!",958,20230812,en,"In this video, we're going
on a $250,000 vacation. This is beautiful. How is this real? And I'm going to show you
the difference between this and a $100,000
presidential vacation. Right this way, sir. A $50,000 vacation where we have
the Eiffel Tower completely to ourselves. I'm holding on for dear life. All the way down to this $1 vacation. Right over here, boys.
This shack is our vacation. - You can see inside of it.
- There's no walls, Jimmy. - Well, I mean, there is walls.
- This is gross. And in case you don't believe me,
it's a dollar. - Look at that.
- Oh, it's $0.93. You're a liar. I rounded up to a dollar. For $1 we get this bed, which is honestly
just a mattress sitting on wood planks, a broken cabinet,
a light that sort of works. Oh, look at that. And lastly, random noises
coming from the ceiling. I was hearing noises in the room,
and there's a raccoon on our roof. I feel like most people would be mad
if their hotel room had a raccoon. But for some reason, we're happy. - When is the check out time?
- Tomorrow. Keep in mind that
later in this video, we're going on a $100,000 vacation. A $250,000 vacation. Can we just jump to that already? No, because we got to suffer so they can compare our
suffering to our happiness. They do like when we suffer. Are we all supposed
to fit on a single bed? If we wanted four beds,
that'd be $4. First, let's get all this sand out. The raccoon just ran in here. I'm gonna act like I didn't scream
like a little girl. Up next, a vacation that's 10,000 times
more expensive. Welcome to the
$10,000 a night vacation. - Oh, my gosh.
- Yo, this is sick! Wait, what the heck is this? This hotel room has jellyfish. - Okay, that's so unnecessary.
- Oh, there's a pool outside. It's a private pool. Does this not look like a scene
from a movie? Your hotel room walks
out to the beach. - Wow.
- Is this our own private beach? Oh, my gosh. This is incredible. Tareq, since when is water this blue? I don't know. This all inclusive vacation
also has a giant spa. Oh, yeah. A park filled with flamingos. Oh, they're fighting - Flamingos.
- And unlimited room service. Okay, what do you need? All of it. The only negative of this place
is it doesn't have a raccoon. Hey, little guy. But I don't blame them for that. When you spend $10,000
at this all inclusive resort, we each get our own floor
of the building. It looks exactly like Jimmy's,
except for I got the top floor. Oh, I have a hammock. I think I can make it in the hammock
without getting wet. I didn't. Yo, look at your view! - Chris!
- Hey. I caught it. - 3, 2, 1…
- Hey! All right, let me lay out
some rules. - Rule number one.
- Yeah. No more throwing pillows in my pool. Rule number two. Sorry, Tareq. And now
what the hotel is known for, this insane infinity pool that extends over our
own personal beach. How does the water just not overflow? I have so many questions. I feel like a father
that took his kids on vacation and is just watching them
hang out in the pool. The $10,000 vacation has been insane, but not as insane
as our next vacation all the way across the planet. And now the $50,000
vacation in Paris. - Oui!
- Baguette! Our $50,000 vacation starts with a completely
private luxury ferry ride. What is that? That's the engine? Bro, what is this, 1805?
Tareq, zoom in on that guy. He is filming us. Hey. - They waved back.
- Do you have a YouTube channel? I don't think he speaks English. This vacation comes complete
with fantastic food. A tour of the entire city. All right. And a luxury hotel room
with an amazing view. - This is kind of romantic, huh?
- Yeah. You and Chandler should kiss. And lastly,
we have a very expensive surprise. So you guys are probably wondering, it's a $50,000 vacation, and we clearly haven't
spent 50 grand yet. Yeah, where is it? It's behind you. That's the Eiffel Tower. Yes. We have the entire Eiffel Tower
completely to ourselves. Wait, actually? Yeah. What portion of the 50 grand
was the tower? Almost all of it. We are at the Eiffel Tower. This feels like we're sneaking in. No, I'm not joking. It's ours.
No one else is here. We can just go
straight through the line. This feels illegal. Most of the time,
this place is packed with people. And because we have the whole thing
completely to ourselves, we're going to try
to get to the top of the tower. I'm talking the very top. Boys, enough playing around.
Let's head up. On the way up, we stopped at the first floor,
over 187 feet in the air, where we had a world class restaurant
all to ourselves. I love though, even though
we have the entire Eiffel Tower, they still put us
in a corner of the restaurant. That's the elevator coming from the top
of the Eiffel Tower. That looks terrifying. Open sesame. Thank you. I can see
my house from up here. We're in France. I can see my hotel from up here. - Look how high up we are.
- Oh, my ears are popping. What are we working with here? Oh, my gosh. You can see the whole city from here. This is crazy. Tareq.
Look how much higher we have to go. This is never going to end. I'm not going to lie,
I thought we were already at the top. We're going up. Now we're heading to the top.
At one point, this was the tallest building
in the world. - Should I jump right now?
- No. Do not move. Come on, boys, follow me. From here on out, there's no more
elevators, just stairs. Oh, it's windy up here. We are high up there. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Tareq,
don't drop the camera. We are standing over
900 feet in the air. The highest point
civilians are allowed on the tower. But since it's ours for the night,
I had one last surprise. What do you think's
behind this door? Stairs. Actually, did I... - How did you know?
- We can see the stairs. Well, yes, there are more stairs, but this takes us
to the very top where no one's allowed to go. Oh, my gosh. Bro. Oh, my God. - Are we allowed on that?
- I don't know. Oh, that is scary. The ledge just comes up
to my waist up here. I am holding on for dear life. I completely understand
why tourists are not allowed up here. We have a cameraman
on the other side of the city with a lens zoomed in on us. He's over a mile away. If this lens is good enough, you should be able to see us
waving for a $50,000 vacation. You got to admit,
this is cool. This is amazing. It'a a once in a lifetime experience. Are you ready
for the best moment yet? I don't know why a YouTuber
has this much power, but lights. Oh, there we go. Oh, my God. Like a disco show. Holy cow! Guys, I don't know
if this next command is going to work,
but turn every light off. Oh, it's pitch black. The Eiffel Tower went dark. What are these millions of French
people thinking right now? They should get me off this tower. I don't know why
they gave me this much control. Next, we head to Switzerland
for the $100,000 vacation. But this is no ordinary vacation. This hotel has two inch thick,
bulletproof windows, a panic button that will lock down
the entire building and it's riddled with security
because this is a hotel where world leaders and presidents
take their vacation. And also the sidemen were in town.
So I invited them to come. Oh, my God. It smells like food in here. We've got the whole ocean in there. - What?
- This is nuts. This is the most expensive penthouse
suite in all of Europe. It covers the whole eighth floor,
has dozens of rooms, tons of staff waiting
on you day and night and absolutely crazy food everywhere. You want a hit?
Yeah, get a hit of that. Oh, yeah. How do these guys compare
to your normal guests? So you'd say they're
pretty dumb compared to… Like I said before, some
of the most powerful world leaders choose this place
for their vacations. Even Bill Clinton stayed here
and he wasn't assassinated. It's pretty safe. In terms of security, here you
have the bulletproof windows. Even this is bulletproof. Oh, my. It feels thick. Pretty solid. I hope. I'm a president. Are you able to negotiate
on behalf of the Sideman? - I can try my best.
- Yes. This will help me in my negotiation. I'd like to buy a 10%. - How much, boys?
- Go, you say it. 200 million, Jimmy. 200 million. All right. To the panic button. - Oh, no.
- I'm not going to lie. I've been wanting to press
this button since we got here. We all agree this is a good idea. - No.
- No. Karl. You're Bill Clinton,
and you feel threatened. Press the panic button.
You pressed it. Oh, wait. - I see a door closed.
- Are we locked in? - Is it locked?
- Are you guys in there? Is that Nolan? Yeah. The door's like shut. I walked off for one second. This button opens it. You don't get to panic
and then open it. If you press the button now, the police will come. And there's a big fine. Don't press it again. I've been thinking. How would a president
get somewhere like McDonald's? Let's see how presidents travel.
Come on in. It turns out
when you're the president, you have to go everywhere
with your bodyguards. So that means that when you drive… Oh, we got an entourage. How do we know which car to get into? On the third or the fourth. Ideally the third or fourth. - Which car is the most dangerous?
- The first one. Nolan, you should ride
the first one. - I can do that.
- Okay. Who wants to ride with me? Harry, come on in. Harry, Chandler. I'm sure the president
doesn’t sit in the middle. Typically,
you guys would be my bodyguards. But, you know, you'll suffice. Just squeeze in mate.
Squeeze in. What president
is going to McDonald's? Does your window roll down?
Hey, how's it going? I can't believe we can do this. This is nice. Turns out when you travel
in a presidential motorcade, a lot of people start to notice you. How's it going? This is bonkers, man. I love how we just draw
the attention of everyone. People are filming, like we're the president.
This is weird. Which made McDonald's
a little awkward. What's going on? Don't mind our security. Jimmy, does this beat out
the Eiffel Tower for you? Depends how good these nuggets are. Obviously, all of the vacations so far have been amazing, but they pale in comparison
to the next one. Our final vacation is once again
across the planet. And now we're in Japan
for the $250,000 vacation and we're meeting up
with a special guest here, so you're gonna want
to watch till the end. To start off our vacation we dropped off our bags in the most
expensive hotel in all of Japan. This is gigantic. I have an echo in a hotel room. And afterwards, we felt like getting to know
the city of Tokyo. Now we're going to drive
Mario Karts on the street. We rented private Mario Karts but we get to literally drive
on the streets of Japan. People are just staring at us. This is not meant to be on a street. There's real cars
driving right beside me. Well, look how many people
are crossing the street here. This is the busiest crosswalk in the world,
and we're driving right through it. We're on Go-karts in Tokyo.
Go-karts! I love Japan. This place is crazy. When we arrived
at our next destination, we met with master swordsman
Yoshioki Sumida. He's been training with the katana
for the last 26 years, and he actually agreed to giving us
a rare lesson in the art of the Samurai. We each got our own katanas and the lesson began
with swinging techniques. It was not as easy as we thought. No, they're going to zoom in on it. Then it was my turn. Boys, you think I'm gonna
be able to do this? - Yes.
- Yeah, you got it. Hey! Let's see how the boys do. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Who am I? And then, our samurai teacher
gifted us this insane katana. I don't deserve this, but thank you. And because this is a quarter million
dollar vacation, we rented out the most premium
sushi chef in the world, along with this entire
floating restaurant. They got Louis Vuitton coasters. The chef makes all the food right
next to our table, and getting to see a master at work was one of
the coolest dining experiences I've ever had. Oh, wow. Oh, my God. They said we could
feed the birds tuna. Here you go, little man See how he caught him
in the air? And once we paid the bill… Thank you. we were off to the craziest place
I've ever been. Follow me.
I rented this whole place. But before we see it, socks off. This is basically an art museum,
but for experience. Oh, my God. I have goosebumps. My eyes are having a hard time
processing it. You think this is what it looks like
when you die? Probably. What is this next room? Normally, this place
is completely full of other people, but we secured the entire experience
for ourselves. This might be one of the best things
we've ever done. Dude, are these fish? We're in a pool, in a museum playing
with animated fish. This is the most unique thing
you could ever do on a vacation. Wait, the fish are surrounding us. How did they know to surround us? They love us. They're going everywhere now. Now you're all probably hungry. Which is why we're at this restaurant
that is ran by robots. What? My name is Pepper. Can we have a seat, Pepper? Sure.
Let's find a comfortable spot. We've reserved the entire place, so the only other people here
were the robot waiters. Food robot is here. Wait, so the food is delivered
on a robot? An oddly fluffy robot. Pepper staring really hard
at Chandler. Pepper does not like Chandler. Bro, I did nothing to you. Everyone make sure
you eat tons of food 'cause tomorrow I rented
an entire theme park and PewDiePie is going to be there,
which is really crazy. You see, PewDiePie
and I have a long history. I was wondering
when you would show up. We helped him in a subscriber race
against T-series. Grab your phone. Go on YouTube, search PewDiePie
and subscribe to him. Eventually, we even caught up to him. Mr. Beast has taken
over me in subscribers. I guess I'm getting a taste
of my own medicine. That's all right.
He definitely deserves it. And even though we've
been friends for a while, we've never actually met in person. And because this is such
a long awaited meetup, I rented this entire amusement park. This is Fuji-Q Highland, the park with the scariest rides
in all of Japan. It usually has thousands of people
waiting in line. But as per usual, I rented the whole thing
just for us. You can ride whatever ride you want. I wasn't done but he left. I'm about to go on this entire
roller coaster alone. What you're seeing here is
the steepest roller coaster drop in the world. Are you scared? - Yes.
- Have fun! I'm scared for him. And like I promised, the father of YouTube,
PewDiePie, met us in the park. A little later than planned
because I texted on the wrong day. Sorry, Felix. And he wanted to ride
the craziest coaster at the park. Why are you scared? I'm so scared of roller coasters. This is one doesn't spin at all. I'll ride it if Felix rides it. - Let's go!
- I'm terrified. I'll do it. I'll do it. If I die on this roller coaster,
you guys are going to feel terrible. You take your shoes off? - Anything that could fly out.
- That's how you know this is bad. They don't even trust us
with shoes on this ride. You got this. You'll be fine. I cannot. This was my worst nightmare. I'm scared, I don't want
to do this. You're scaring me. Calm down! Whatever you do, don't throw up. I'm terrified.
Can we pick a better one? We could have picked
a nice, comfortable ride. I actually have no idea what it is. At some point,
there's a literal 90 degree drop. You're freaking me out.
What did you sign me up for? You brought me here. But what we didn't know was this ride goes backwards. Why are we going backwards? Why did I do this? Oh, my God. We're upside down! Jimmy! This is crazy! Best roller coaster ever! Oh, my gosh. Felix, what did we just do? I'm crying. Best roller coaster ever. I got tears just running down. It was good meeting you, Jimmy.
I'm gonna head out. Oh, yeah. You screamed
at the first little bow. What? Thank you. I don't think I've ever had
a chewy potato before. That's what you get for passing me. Felix, I'm sorry for passing you. You don't have to threaten me
with violence though. - They're good.
- Yeah, they are good. That was the $250,000 vacation. Felix, can you transition us? Bro fist."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhB3BgJyGl8,7 Days Stranded At Sea,1085,20230805,en,"We are now stranded on
a raft in the middle of the ocean and there goes our boat. We are now stranded for seven days. - How much longer?
- Seven days. Frick. This raft is literally countless
miles from the nearest civilization. And whether we like it or not, my four friends and I
are stuck on this raft. And it's not going to be easy.
This is brutal. It won't stop raining!
We're all at rock bottom now. This challenge went from fun
to a literal nightmare. Very fast. Bro, look how far away the boat is. I can't even see it anymore. So, step one. We're going to get sunburned
if we don't get shade. And I had survival specialists equip this raft with tons of wood,
rope and everything else. We would need to build ourselves
a shelter. Boys, we need to get started.
We are running out of light! I got this. My finger! Now, we set these up like a teepee. We picked the worst day to start. As you can tell by the clouds, it's
literally about the storm. So, first thing we want to do
is set up some structure to cover us. Also, since we're on this slab of wood
for the next seven days, we need a place to hide
from the sun so we don't get sunburned. So two birds, one stone. Speaking of birds,
while we were building, - this happened.
- A bird! - It's coming right at us!
- Oh, my god! It's a bird! Yes! This is crazy. - We should name him.
- What's his name? Bryan. Bryan. Bryan. Bryan. What if you went and got some fish? I know, he's looking at me.
He understands. - Jimmy, just say the word.
- Put the knife away. - Okay. I'll put the knife away.
- And the hatchet. Bryan, that was a joke. Forget the bird.
We got to build a shelter. - We're making friends.
- While Bryan watched, We worked on our first shelter
for the rest of the day. Except for my friend Tareq, who spent the entire day
getting cool drone shots. And I'm not even mad about it. Inside this crate is the food for all five of us for the next seven days. Oh, my God. And in these two barrels is our entire water supply
for all five of us. How does it taste? Very hot. We're screwed. There was dirt in my cup. It's getting dark, and that crate
has the word ""sleep"" on it. Hopefully, the survival guides
gave us something soft. - Why are they wet?
- Things do get wet on a boat. I'm ready for bed.
I wanna go to sleep. This is night one,
and Bryan is just yawning. This is miserable. This is all the coverage we have. I didn't realize what I was
signing up for. It's hot. This thing will not stop swaying,
and I feel like I'm going to puke. And I'm surrounded by a bunch
of sweaty people Aye, sweaty men. If you guys
smell this bad on day one, what are you going
to smell like on day 7? Oh, gosh. Our first night of sleep
was really rough. Sleeping is impossible. These waves are just making me
miserable. And to make matters worse,
our best friend Bryan ended up leaving us that morning. -Bryan!
-Bryan! Bryan! But regardless, today's
objective is to build ourselves a permanent weatherproof shelter. How do we turn that
into a livable structure? There's definitely something here. Luckily, I had them throw
a bunch of wood on the raft so we could build a nice house. How we build the house? I'm not quite sure, but they said
this is enough to build a house. But ironically,
right as we got started, - It's raining!
- Don't throw it! Jimmy, get my shark pillow! This is miserable! This is bad. Oh, Jesus Christ. You're not doing
the right thing, Nolan. - Listen with your ears!
- Why do you yell so much! - Because you don't listen!
- I wanna hit Nolan! - It's just rain.
- Shut up! At least we don't have to shower. Yeah. This is so bad. And we still have over
six days left. Where do we go poop? - Oh, we have to build the pooper.
- What? -We have to build everything
that's here. We have to build the toilet. Build our shelter,
the fire, everything. The moment the rain finished, the boys and I needed to build
all of our survival essentials. Starting with the shelter. Tearing it down in the name
of something better. Five minute break for Chris. I also need a break. I'm seasick. I'm out of it. You got to pick this up. I can't. I can't pick it up anymore. I feel like
you're doing all the work, but we got two other goofs
just laying down. I'm miserable. We built one wall. - Yeah, we built one wall.
- All together. All of us. Regardless of being seasick, it was going to take all of us
if we wanted to finish this. Now, you guys
bring it forward. There we go. Let's go! How many YouTubers does it take
to build a little structure? Wait? Is that a whale? Think that's a whale?
That's insane. Oh, my God. - It's unreal.
- There are actually whales. This experience
just keeps getting better. Shelter, water, not being near Nolan. I'm never going to take that
for granted again. Probably would have been really
useful to build the ladder first. We got a ladder. I literally
just built just 4 minutes ago. After hours of building,
we were finally getting somewhere. I severely regret
making this a seven day challenge instead of a 50 hour challenge. Like all our other videos.
We keep rocking back and forth. It's freakin' miserable.
I'm going to puke. And finally, just as
the sun was going down… - Camp is now organized.
- Yeah! Night two, my bed is still broken,
but I'm going to get some sleep tonight because I'm that tired. I'm gonna head to bead.
Did I wake you? Yeah. Just go back to bed,
I'm just vlogging. I accidentally woke Lazar up,
I feel bad now. This might be the most tired I've ever been in my entire life. It's now day three. And somehow our building
didn't fall over. I'll take that as a dub. The noises that the structure made while I was sleeping last night, filled me with nightmares. It's day three and we've really
started to get into a rhythm. Our morning routine
consisted of peeing in the corner, - Bro, who vlogs in the pee corner? I'm not moving. - eating our breakfast,
- Surviving on Feastables. It's all you need? and drinking hot barrel water. So dehydrated, I need this. We're about 36 hours in
and we're almost halfway - through a barrel of water.
- Is that slow or fast. We're going to run out on day six. Running low on water
and food gave me an idea. I'm kind of curious to see
what's under the boat people do. There's so many fish below us! So we decided to try and catch some dinner,
but we weren't very good at it. Why does it take so long? I just want something
to put my stomach. Bryan! Bryan, help us catch fish! Bryan! Turns out fishing is a lot harder
than YouTube. After hours,
we caught absolutely nothing. Why can't we catch anything?
Oh, I give up. We were tired,
dehydrated and hungry. Which forced us to dig
into our rations. Let's have ourselves a feast. Yeah! Call it a Feast-ables. Aye! In our supplies, We had wood to build a fire
and pans to cook with. You take big stick
and make really little sticks and then make medium sticks. Then use the big sticks at the end. Look at them beans, baby! I'm so excited.
This looks awesome. -These are really good.
-Can you tell we've been at sea for three days? - Literally.
- When have I ever been this excited over canned chili? Hey, I put some love into this one. It's not just canned chili anymore. It's got tomatoes, kidney beans. You don't have to keep talking.
I'm already drooling. This was our first hot meal in days, but it was also
a good chunk of our rations, so we made sure to enjoy it. I feel a lot better. I think the first two days
were definitely the most miserable. I think we're slowly,
like losing our minds and it's actually becoming
bearable. I still haven't gone
to the bathroom. That's my biggest concern,
you know? I'm struggling to sleep. This raft is just rocking
like crazy. Definitely I'm kind of miserable. Hopefully tomorrow is better. None of us managed to get any sleep. We lost the back of our
fort last night. The house needs some repairs. Tensions are pretty high
on the raft this morning. Nolan's a little upset.
He broke his bed. Oh, my God. Nolan is struggling. He's just in his feels right now. It'll be okay. He probably would've
quit the channel if I did that. This is easily the worst. Oh, there's thunder. I swear.
If it starts raining again… Oh, I can't take that. And to make matters worse, we accidentally dropped our ladle
in the drinking water. And since we haven't showered
in four days, grabbing it technically
contaminated the drinking water. I'm never drinking out of that
again. Fast forward
to when we run out of water. Because of the contamination, a third of our water
was no longer safe to drink. Whatever reason, the more I suffer,
the more you guys watch some of our most popular videos. are when I buried myself alive,
spent time in solitary confinement. So I hope you're happy.
I'm suffering again. It's not easy surviving on a raft,
but after four long days, Lazar's finally pooping. Can you play a celebratory song? LazarBeam is - pooping.
- Is pooping. See how all those clouds
over there are dark? Yeah. Yeah. They're going to pour
down on us tonight. Tonight's going to suck. We didn't know it yet, but the biggest storm of the entire
challenge was headed right towards us. And when we saw it approaching, we tried to prepare
as much as possible Can't wait for another storm
just to destroy all this again. Tareq's
fixing his side of the fort. Chris is fixing the roof,
and I'm now the cameraman for some reason. There's a storm-a-brewing. And while they're
preparing the shelter for the storm,
I'm going to tell you about Shopify because it might literally storm
until the end of the challenge. This is going to be a bit rocky. Shopify is a platform
that makes it easy for anyone to start a business. They literally support
millions of small businesses all around the world,
from selling wood to nails, to crates to... Crocs, they support
businesses that sell it on Shopify. Assuming we're going to have
absolutely zero tops covering this structure, I am worried about it. 100% of what I sell online
from merch to Feastables, I do with Shopify. It's actually getting pretty rocky
out here. - The wind is getting crazy!
- We're out of nails! It's really hard to work
around the wind, guys. Stop yelling and do things! Shopify even has a new AI tool
called Sidekick, making running
your entire business easier. Just like surviving on this
raft can be hard, so can entrepreneurship. And that's why
they do everything in their power to make it as easy as possible. - This is my worst nightmare.
- I'm so miserable! Go to Shopify.com/MrBeast to give it a try right now.
Thank you, Shopify. Let's go prep for the storm. I'm soaking wet! Maybe you can start
helping us, Jimmy. I was paying for the raft! The storm was really
starting to pick up but that night,
it got so much worse. This really puts the helter
in the shelter, right? Oh no, you! Are you kidding me? - It's leaking!
- Oh, no... This shelter is the opposite
of waterproof. This is brutal. What do we do? We have three more... The next three days, by the way. - No!
- There's water everywhere. It's useless. This does nothing. This is the most insane night yet. We are struggling right now. Is this safe anymore? We could've just filmed
this in a studio. but no, we have to
be the real channel that doesn't fake things. We're gonna die! We're getting just destroyed.
I'm getting hit. There's a hole that is completely
opened up over my bed. I can't do this. - I can't do this.
- You can end this video, Jimmy. Jimmy, please. I tried to talk all you guys
out of it. You all said yes! This is the worst experience
I've ever had in my entire life. I hate every part of this. I'm just miserable right now. The storm was reaching a new peak
with every passing hour. We were desperate,
so we tried using our beds as literal walls
to protect us from the rain. We're all at rock bottom now. It's been raining for a few hours. It's freezing cold. We don't have beds.
I'm getting nauseous. I don't know if we're
going to make it these full seven days at this point. It rained nonstop
for around 20 hours straight. and after standing the whole night
completely soaked and exhausted, we had to push ourselves to dry off
our supplies and rebuild camp. Our raft is just in shambles. Look at our beds,
we're drying them off. This is harder than Antarctica. This is harder than the desert video. I'm just ready to be home. I hate this raft. I never want to see it again. Our entire fire pit
is completely drenched. We couldn't start a fire
if we wanted to tonight. No dinner. And to make matters worse, all of
our food was completely soaked. Meaning only a portion
of it was still safe to eat. We had stability,
we had food, we had dry beds, and we took it for granted. We can't take
another night like that. We need to waterproof
the shelter. We just ripped that off to tide it here,
and then we'll leave it there. But this time we have this. Last night we were shivering cold. and wanted to die. So would you rather be
warm and dry or cold and wet? Put a zip tie here. Nolan. Tie a rope to that, zip tie there. We can use that to push us up
so we get even more room. I'm thinking, why don't I make
a really big clothesline and hang up all our wet stuff? Maybe we'll have dry towels
by tomorrow. I want to die. I'm sunburned, tired, dehydrated,
and did I say tired? After fixing camp,
we were so exhausted that we spent most
of the day sleeping. But at least when we woke up, we were reunited
with a familiar friend. - Bryan!
- Bryan! Bryan! - Bryan!
- Bryan! Bryan, come back! After being stuck in a raft
for five days with these guys. This really is a nightmare. I'll admit it, - I missed Bryan.
- He's moved on. You may not have given up on Bryan,
but Bryan gave up on you. Bryan's given up on us. We have two days left.
We're running out of food. Our water is contaminated,
and we're all borderline dying. I'm going crazy. These last two days
will be interesting. What could go wrong now? I can literally see 500
fish down there. That is crazy. Oh, my gosh.
This poop bucket stinks. I almost had a mental breakdown
last night. I was shivering wet the entire time. Could not sleep. It was one of the worst nights
of my life. Last night,
shivering in the torrential rain in the middle of the deep,
dark ocean. You know, we got through it. Now, the end of this challenge
could not come soon enough. Making the challenge 7 days
was a horrible decision. This is so much harder. The new reinforced, waterproof
fortress actually worked. Lannan said it rained last night, did it? At 4 a.m., sprinkled a little. Hey, here's the beauty. I didn't even know. That was the best sleep
I've ever gotten. I actually got a full night's
sleep last night. I can barely even open my eyeballs. I would say this is the hardest
challenge we've ever done, adding the extra five days
on the end of a 50 hour challenge definitely makes it harder. The fact
that we're just drifting at sea on this hunk of wood,
that's pretty impressive. And while it seemed like
the rain was over, we found ourselves
encountering a new obstacle. We've gone from shivering cold
like two nights ago to being scorching hot,
unbelievably hot. I'm about to jump in the water
because I'm getting too hot. We're going to go swimming. I hope Nolan can swim. And while they cooled off
in their own way, we got creative with ours. Oh, yes. It's fans. Cold air. I feel amazing. Air! A jellyfish bit me! Why does the ocean hate us? I knew it was a great idea
not to go swimming. - Are you okay?
- Oh, my leg! I found the sweet spot. Yeah. Oh, no. Yeah, I got a little welts
and some red lines. For the majority of the day,
it was so hot we literally
couldn't walk on the deck. Yeah, I'm hot. I don't want to be alive.
I'm hot. It's very hot. But as the sun went down,
we were optimistic about reaching the finish line. We have less than 24 hours
left in the challenge. This has genuinely been the hardest challenge video
I've ever been a part of. Honestly, this whole experience
has made me appreciate all the things we take
for granted in life. Like your shower, your food. I miss food. A working toilet. I never want to poop
in a bucket again. I say we celebrate making it
this far with a Feastable bar. Yes, available in every Walmart,
Target, 7-Eleven, Albertson's in America. It's 2023, If you're still buying Hershey's,
it's kind of lame. Hershey's for the boomers. - Oh, Jimmy,
- How did you break the chair? what is happening? Jimmy, I'm starting to think
you ate all the food. I guess I'll just continue
the time-lapse with a broken chair. This is our final night
sleeping together, everybody. Oh, I'm so glad to sleep alone. I'm gonna miss
sleeping by your side. 100%. I would not rather
sleep next to any other man. And with that, I'm going to bed. After an amazing night's sleep,
we were visited by a familiar face. Bryan brought his family to say
goodbye to us on the last day. Thank you, Bryan.
That meant a lot. It's almost like we were family
to Bryan. We were. He kept us safe during like,
the night we had the least shelter. Maybe he's just a pea brain bird. - Shut up.
- Nolan. Off the rack. - I wish.
- That was emotional. Everything's going full circle. We had so many crazy memories
in this raft. Yeah, and I think my best
memory is going to be leaving. Same. We spent over 150 hours
on this floating piece of wood. And even though it was easily
the hardest thing I've ever done, the boys and I still had
some good times. - Where's this boat?
- Where's the boat? The boat! Then finally,
the end was literally in sight. The boat, it's coming! Alert the ship of our location. Signaling the boat! Boat! Boat! Boat! Why is it moving so abnormally slow? - Oh, my God!
- I'm getting off this raft. The first 10,000 people to go

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuhE6PYnRMc,Train Vs Giant Pit,636,20230708,en,"- I just bought this train and it is currently barreling full-speed towards that giant pit over there. We're also crashing countless cars, blowing up thousands of
sticks of real dynamite, and even putting 10 jet engines on a car. Just to show you the most
insane experiments of all time. Starting with filling a house
with over 100,000 fireworks. Please do not try this in your house. For this experiment, each of the boys will hide
a dummy in my new house to see if it's even possible to survive. - Water and fire don't mix, my mannequin is going to survive. - Mine's in the fridge. - Go in, come on. Let's blow this house up. Hey be careful. If you accidentally press
one, the house explodes. - Oh my goodness.
- Please. Where's your mannequin? - Bathtub.
- Fridge. - Under the washer. - Tareq?
- Front porch. - Oh yeah, it's sitting right there. This is gonna be the coolest thing you have ever seen in your life! - Yes! 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. - Fire in the hole! - Oh my God! - What happened to the house? I can't even see it anymore. - Oh my god! - I don't think our mannequins are gonna make it. - The house burned all night, until there was literally nothing left, including all the mannequins. Next experiment. We're about to play Tug-of-War between this real military tank and these two school buses. And the loser gets dragged into the pit. - There's no way the tank loses. - We're probably gonna lose. - No, we're not. - Now obviously, people
can't be in these vehicles, 'cause they'll die when
they fall in the pit. So this remote actually controls the tank. This feels illegal. 3, 2, 1. Go! - I'm full throttled right now. You're done for! Oh!
- Oh, we're screwed. - The buses are done for. Oh my god. - Oh my god! - Oh my god! - Do you hear the buses beeping? Its horn's going off. - We're gonna go investigate
the bottom of the pit to see the buses. - Oh god.
- Oh, no. I need to stop looking down this is... Stop moving!
- I'm not moving! - We're in the pit. Oh my gosh. Bro, look at that. Why'd the bus think it
could beat the tank? - I don't think it did. - Later in this video, a train's gonna come off those tracks and land right about there. But before we do that, this is $50,000, and it is surrounded by
thousands of pounds of TNT. And this is Will. - What's up guys? - See that crate in the field?
- Yeah. Oh, man. - That is around 1% of the explosives surrounding this money. - Are we safe standing here? - Uh yeah, you'll be fine. Here's my credit card. Spend as much money as you
want to protect this 50 grand. I don't care if you use wood, bricks, or even steel to protect this money. Whatever's left of this 50 grand when that TNT blows up, you keep. Good luck building walls. - All right, let's make $50,000! - I don't think he stands a chance. The first thing Will did was buy 12 industrial water containers and filled them with
20,000 pounds of water. - I'm really worried that Jimmy's TNT is gonna get through this. - And he should be, because this isn't even close
to enough to stop the TNT. Meanwhile, we're gonna
test another experiment. In a previous video, we
put a jet engine on a car and it jumped eight buses. So this time we put 10
jet engines on the car and we're to see if it
flies 10 times further. When this car flies off this ramp, I think it's gonna go past
all the buses into the trees. - I think it's gonna hit the first bus. - Our guesses couldn't be further apart. He's currently matrix-ed into the car, so he sees what the car sees. Chris!
- Hey! - Oh, should we move? - Yeah, we're sending a rocket car. - Oh, okay. - 3, 2, 1. Send the jet car! The car's coming straight at us. - I lost signal. - Maybe we should jump? - Now I'm straightening it. - Oh, my god! Yeah!
- What the heck? - Whoa! Wait, wait. We broke the ramp! - I think it was a success.
- Yes. The jet car easily cleared all 12 buses and literally left a crater in the road. I love how this block of engine's just on the road. - Yeah, it's still smoking. Whoa! - Oh, it's leaking.
- Oh, and it's smoking. - And now we're back at the giant pit. If you jump in this deep pit and land on a thousand bouncy balls, would you die? - I'd love to know. Nolan, catch! - Catch what? What are we doing? - Goodbye. Oh! Oh. - You completely missed! - Luckily we have more mannequins. Will it survive? Pay attention! - Oh. Oh! - Oh, buckets! - Hey Jimmy! What if we dropped the car in it? - I think you know what's about to happen. - Yo! - Clearly that mannequin didn't survive. Next bit. Meanwhile, Will was desperately trying to protect his $50,000. He's honestly taken
this way more seriously than I thought he would. - In the past four days,
I've hired some professionals and we've already built
the cinder block wall, filled it with matches, and we're already on our
second cinder block wall. This dynamite is not getting through. - You blew my expectations
outta the water. How about this? If you let me double the
TNT, I'll double the money. - So a hundred grand, double the TNT. - Yeah, but if it blows
it up, you get nothing. - Take the deal! Take the deal! - Okay! Okay!
- It's a deal baby! Deal baby! - And while he kept working,
the boys and I went bowling. And the bowling balls are these cars. - I'm ready to see some destruction. - Let's see if I get a strike. Hey, first bowl a strike. Oh, it's not going straight. - Oh, it's coming in our direction. We should move. We should move. We should move.
- Nolan, watch out! - Oh, into the field. There it goes. Oh it's turning around. - Oh, it's coming back! - Oh God.
- It's coming back. The car's got a mind of it's own! - It's coming back! - Take number two. Oh, that's a perfect strike. - Whoa! - Whoa!
- Let's go! - I love cars hitting things! - And if you're wondering, the other car is still going in circles. During this bit, me and the boys have been wearing some brand new designs, which you can now buy on our new store, MrBeast.store. 3, 2, 1. We switched from ShopMrBeast.com,
which was very long- - Move over! Move over! - to MrBeast.store. Oh, my gosh! - Ooh!
- No way! - Whoa! - We just about died. - I'm gonna show you how to
just hit a full strike easily. - Okay. - All right. Here comes a strike, baby. - A .store domain is the perfect choice for anyone looking to
sell anything online. - That was the worst throw yet. - That was the best throw yet! - That was awesome! - If you're looking to set up a store, it should be at .store domain, so your customers clearly know
that your website is a store. - This is Carl's car. - Unlike .com, MrBeast.store
tells the world that the website is my store. Oh. Don't forget to head to MrBeast.store and buy our brand new merch, right now. Since I doubled Will's money and TNT, he's completed a seven-layer fortress of 20,000 pounds of water, mattresses, a cinder block wall, four mattresses, a second cinder block wall, an additional 32,000 pounds of water, all packed in with a final wall of dirt. - But I actually have another layer that Jimmy knows nothing about. Jimmy will never see this one coming. - What? - Hey, Jimmy! - How am I supposed to blow up Feastables? - That's the point. - And with the TNT doubled, it's time to put Will's
bunker to the test. I also brought number 40,
from 1 throughout 100, back to help us blow up all this TNT. You're in charge of the button. Don't press anything yet. Oh god. Moment of truth. Whenever you're ready, press the one. I'm nervous. Whoa! - Oh my god! - Oh, that money's gone for sure. - Oh my god! - Bro, look at that smoke cloud! - I can't even see anything. Is it okay? - Wait, I think I see
money falling from the sky. - No! Seven days of work just went up in flames. I don't know if I've got this. I gotta see if my money's okay! - Why are we running? - I'm running 'cause he's running. - Oh my goodness! Oh, there's so many stacks! - We counted out the money and over $95,000 survived the explosion. - I just won $95,000! - Congrats on the 95 grand. Let's go see what happens if
you drive a train into a pit! - Yeah!
- Whoo! - And now's the moment
you've all been waiting for, a train is gonna go
full-speed down those tracks into this giant pit. If you were on this train,
where would you sit? - I put my mannequin in the cabin. Statistically the safest
place to be on a train. - All right, you got this. - All right, we're gonna
sit him right on the front. You're not going anywhere. - We're gonna give the
Feastables bar a front row seat. Stop eating Hershey's. Eat Feastables. We have waited our entire
lives for this moment. This is going to be epic. Nolan, send the train! - The train's coming! Let's do this! - Oh my god. Here it goes! - Oh my god, here it comes! - Oh, my god! - Whoa! Look at that! That might have been the coolest thing I've ever seen in my life. - Are you kidding me? - Yeah, my mannequin didn't survive. - Train versus pit, the pit won. I hope you enjoyed the video. Let's end it with an explosion. - Ooh! That is so hot! ♪ Mr. Beast ♪"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48h57PspBec,"$1 vs $1,000,000,000 Yacht!",887,20230610,en,"- This is a $1 billion super yacht, and it's big enough to hold
an entire city on the water. How do humans build this stuff? And I'm gonna show you the
difference between this and a $300 million mega yacht,
a $50 million giga yacht, all the way down to this $1 yacht. Why did you sell me
this boat for a dollar? - The storage just kept racking up. - Yeah.
- $18,000. - It's cost you 18 grand
a year to store this? - Correct.
- Interesting. Here you go.
- Thank you. And after stepping on board it was pretty clear why
this yacht only cost $1. Okay, now that we're on the water what are we working with in here? - I don't think the floor's
supposed to do that. I don't know if this
is even worth a dollar. - Oh, we're actually sinking. Oh. The boat literally started sinking right when we put it in the water. - Oh, my God. Let's go. - We gotta go up. We're sinking. Jump, Chandler. My baby! I paid a dollar for that. That was the $1 yacht. Later in this video, we
have a $50 million yacht a $300 million yacht, and
the $1 billion super yacht. But before all that,
here's the $1 million yacht which is a little smaller
than I thought it would be. Hop on, boys. All right.
- Let's see the inside. - On the $1 million yacht, you get a surprisingly big living room, a lower deck with a master bedroom, another bedroom that I can't stand up in, and then you got some
double beds for the kids. - Wait, you have kids? - Chris, Chandler, Karl, Nolan. - Don't worry, boys. I got this. Coming on the break to break. - Please stop. Someone's
gonna send a rescue boat. - We need the coast guard. - I wonder if I turn this, if he'll fall. Stop. - This is fun. Oh. - For a million dollar
boat, I'm not gonna lie, it's a little smaller than I thought. Let's see if these guys watch our videos. - Oh, my God, it's Mr. Beast. - Hey, he has seen our channel. That's pretty funny. So, now we're going to
the $10 million one. - 10 million? - See ya.
- It's gonna be great. - Bye. Oh, my God. He's fast. - And now we are on the $10 million yacht. Let's check this out. - Holy crap, the front of the boat's huge. It's just way bigger than the last one. Look at the view. - I'm getting some good sun here. I'm really pale. - Oh, my gosh. Yes,
this is a nice bedroom. For $9 million more I
can actually stand up. And right down these stairs
are four more massive bedrooms. Why are there two toilets side by side? - Oh, that's a bidet, Jim. - For your butt? - You poop in here and then you wash your butt in here. - Why don't you just use toilet paper? - You're so American. - And upstairs is another seating area. Oh, my gosh. The seats on the $1 million
yacht were leather and hot. These are actually soft. - Soft and practical. - This boat is the nicest
boat I've been on so far. - Well, just wait until
you see the next one. It's massive. And because it's so massive,
I invited all my friends. Go have fun.
- Go, go, go. - This boat is meant to hold 150 people. They're gonna have a lot of fun. - Whoa.
- Oh, my God. - This is wild. What is the difference
between this and a mansion? - This is a mansion. When does it stop? Jimmy, I'm still going. - This is definitely the nicest
bedroom we've seen so far. And it's nice because my
head doesn't hit the ceiling. I can barely touch it now. This yacht has a living room, an office, a massage parlor, two dining
rooms, and seven bedrooms. - This is the best yacht
I've been on so far. I'm driving the boat. - Chocolate. It's not Feastables. - It's not Feastables. Thank you for saving my life.
- You're welcome. No way. ♪ You gotta ♪ - No. - Hey buddy, are you relaxed? - Yeah, I was. - Are you done with your massage yet? Here you go, take a bite. - That's some good chocolate. - So, we got all of the
goon squads in here. This is a $25 million boat with 30 rooms. Why are you guys in here? - This bed is so comfortable. - Even though this yacht
comes with a world class chef the boys still wanted pizza. So, I planned a little surprise. Do you know what we're standing on boys? - A boat.
- A hospital. - An H.
- A boat. - A helipad. And Uber conveniently does
helicopter deliveries. That can't be real. - Oh, it's real. - Is that a helicopter? - Pizza. - I can't believe it's actually works. - Pizza! - Pizza, pizza, pizza. - All this for some pizza.
- Woohoo. - Pizza, pizza, pizza. - I am terrified of parallel parking. He just landed a helicopter
on a moving boat. Who wants some pizza? I know you're not supposed to swim after you eat a bunch of pizza, but you're on
- Jump. a $25 million yacht. Which thankfully when you pay 25 million, you can get some jet skis. - Oh. - Tariq flipped the jet ski. Yo, Mac. Catch this pizza. Oh. - Oh. - Oh. Oh. - $25 million yacht and I'm
the only one enjoying it. - If you thought this yacht was crazy, look at this video of
the $50 million yacht. You know what? Honestly, let's just go to it right now. Zoom in. And now, we are on the $50 million yacht. This yacht is over 200 feet
long, four stories high, can hold over 200 people, and
comes with a 20 person crew with this homeless person I found. Sup guys? - When you pay $50 million, you're given this remote
that can call the crew at any time you call me. - Sir, did you call me? - No, I just wanted to
show how this works. But that's not the only
thing the remote does. They said this TV goes up and down. - That's cool. That is slow, dude. Maybe it's like... I'm gonna go downstairs, you guys go upstairs. Tell me if you find anything cool. - Okay.
- Okay. - Bro, it is massive. - It's like a whole nother boat up here. - Jimmy, there's nothing
cool up here. Don't worry. - This is crazy. - Whoa. The interesting thing is
I've just been walking and I don't know if I'm
at the halfway point, the end of the boat, or if I just started. This thing's huge. - Meanwhile, Nolan overslept. So, he was still trying to find us. Have you seen Mr. Beast? - Yeah.
- Yeah. - Are you lying to me? - Yeah. - Apparently Pete Davidson is there. If I don't see Pete Davidson, I'm gonna sink the $50 million yacht. - Meanwhile, we noticed
another boat was approaching us and then the owner did this. I was waving at him and
he showed me his butt. - That's gonna be someone's
dad one day, dude. - All right, catch. Oh. - Where are they going?
- Gimme that, gimme that. - Are they backing away from us or are we just that much better? Oh. - Get 'em. - This is the best.
- Oh. Oh.
- Oh. The guy that's bigger and
stronger than all of us did it. Wow, Chucky. - I wonder what kind of
food they got on this yacht. - I heard they have lamb. - They do not have lamb. - Mm-hmm.
- No. - Cut to the dinner. - Oh, man.
- Whole lamb. Thank you so much. - It's really good. What projects do you have coming up?
- Uh. Ooh, I'm very excited. I have a show called Bupkis coming out on Peacock on May 4th. - Three days before my birthday. And while Nolan was
still trying to find us. - Which direction did Mr. Beast go? - We noticed a lot of boats surrounding our floating billboards. I didn't even know you could
put billboards in the ocean. And we thought they might
want some chocolate. - I'm delivering chocolate. Yo, you guys want chocolate? - Let's do this. Oh, my gosh. - Best chocolate I've ever had. - Let's go.
- It's so good. - Yeah.
- Let know if this is the best chocolate bar ever. - Oh, my God. Out of 10, it's an 11. Hershey's don't know nothing. - Hershey's doesn't know nothing. Everyone agrees it's
better than Hershey's. You need to try it. Tell me what you think. - Honestly, way better than Reese's. - That's what I like to hear. What do you give it? Aye. - A 10.
- I'm flying Feastable bars to people. Aye, Feastables incoming. - Oh, no.
- Let go of the string. One Feastable bar delivered. Hey Karl, they're trying your gummies. - If you wanna try the best
chocolate bars, cookies, and gummies on the planet? Go to Walmart, 7-Eleven, or
any Albertsons stores right now or go to feastables.com right
now if you wanna order online. Hey, what do you think? - This is amazing. This is better than every other chocolate so why wouldn't you get Deez Nutz? - I agree. Put our nuts in your mouth. - Oh. Alright. - At the end of the day,
Nolan finally found us. - Jimmy. - Nolan. We had another five star dinner. And the next morning we boarded one of the world's largest yachts. This is the $300 million yacht and it has over 50 crew members waiting on your every request. Tons of luxurious rooms and nine master bedrooms. Oh, my gosh. Great. - Welcome aboard. - I literally can't see the
top of the boat from here. We are the 69th largest yacht in the world. - Is that a factual statement? - Yes, it is.
- That is crazy. There are six floors, a massive pool, and a hot tub with a view. This is nice. - It's ridiculous. - It's my favorite boat so far. - The $300 million yacht comes
with a state-of-the-art gym that overlooks the ocean. - Oh, what? - Dude, if my boat had
a gym, I'm working out. - A movie theater with
windows that auto darkened whenever you watch something. And even the table is worth $3 million and the piano plays itself. I want one of these in my house. All the boys disappeared in the spa. Come with me. Oh, you're getting a haircut? Yeah. Karl was in the sauna. Are you alive? - Barely. - That does not look comfortable. And I don't even know where Nolan is. - Oh, it's so hot. - Man, really got in a hot tub with a sunburn.
- It's too hot. - Dude, there's more downstairs? - Whoa.
- Oh, my gosh. - You think they have enough jet skis? - What's behind this door? - Oh, I'm doing this. - One of us is getting thrown
off the side of the boat. - Huh? - He was last.
- Bye. - Hey, always, always
be ready for nose goes. - Jimmy, can we eat some food? - Yeah, when you get back. Boys, we must act like rich billionaires. Clink. Would you rather have 300 $1 million ships or one $300 million ship? - You could almost have one for every different day of the year. - I'm not gonna take care of 300 boats. - Which would you rather have? 300 boats or one big boat? - You want the big boat? - Gentlemen, did any of you
notice a boat pulling up? - No. - On that boat might be Tom Brady. By might, I mean it is. And we should probably go say hi to him. - Let's go. - Hey, Tom.
- What's up, guys? - And if you don't know who Tom Brady is, he is the number one
quarterback in NFL history. So, this is where you get
your haircut on the boat. So, it turns into a dentistry.
- Where you wash. - Clean your teeth too. Is this the nicest boat you've been on?
- My God, are you kidding me? - Yeah.
- It's crazy if you eat too many Deez
Nutz bars before breakfast. I literally had to hide them in my house because I knew these two would sneak to right where they're at.
- Yeah. - I did. This place is so fun. It's really an endless maze. I think it's a nicest boat in the world. That's what we do.
- It's so beautiful. - It's crazy.
- We still have more floors to go on.
- Tariq's, the master of the camera. Thank you, thank you. - This is a way nicer helicopter pad. - When I think of a
helicopter pad on a yacht this is what I think of. Not what we had before. And with Tom Brady here, of course, we had to play some football. This is the most fun version of catch 'cause you just do this and
he just throws it there. - Nope. - I just suck. - That's what I got paid
for, Jimmy. Come on. - I wanna see if you could
hit my drone out of the sky - Oh, no.
- with a football. - All right, if I hit the
drone on the first try, maybe I should come out of retirement. - I like that.
- Dad, you're gonna like miss. - I probably will miss. - First try. - Go, go, go.
- Oh. He got it. - Nolan, put your sunscreen on. Karl's probably the worst wide receiver you've ever thrown to. Unless you dome him in the head, he's probably not gonna catch it. All right, Karl, don't screw this up. Just throw it as far as you can. You hit him in the chest. You gotta hit him in the head.
- It's a bad placing. After chilling with Tom Brady, we hung out in the movie room
for the rest of the night. Would you say this is
the best boat so far? - 100%.
- But keep in mind, there's still a billion
dollar boat after this. - How big can that get? - It is four times bigger than this boat. - These things get bigger? - This ship is bigger than
three statues of liberty. - Holy crap. - You cannot fathom how
massive this ship is. It is literally a floating city that is 1200 feet wide
and 17 stories high, and it fits almost 10,000 people. In all the other ships
we had our own rooms but this ship has over 2000 rooms. This boat has water
slides, an indoor mall, a basketball court,
and tons of other stuff I can't even name. - I ran out of fingers. - All of which we have to ourselves. Have fun boys.
- Yeah, yeah. - Brother, it's that way. - Oh, okay.
- Let's see what happens. - Whoa, there's a water slide. - There's a whole entire
waterpark up here. I'm breaking the rules. - We're running, we're running. - Sorry, lifeguard. They literally have live
music in the waterpark. What the heck?
- There's even an entire sports floor that has
everything you can imagine. - Mini golf.
- Let's go. - We're literally playing
mini golf on a ship right now. Interference. - And I wasn't exaggerating, when I said this ship is a city. There's literally seven
neighborhoods on this ship. This is insane. We're still on a ship. And just for reference, this is what one of those neighborhoods look like. - So, I went down to the slide and now I'm teleported into
like a different world. And you have a carousel? - They have shops, restaurants,
arcades, even a Starbucks. Hey, Chandler. - Hey.
- A hundred million people are watching. Let's see if you make the shot. - This is crazy. Like how can I use all these seats? I'm only one person. - And apparently there's an entire floor for indoor shows and events. - What is this, bro? We got the whole ship to ourselves, selves, selves, selves,
selves, selves, selves. - Obviously, I don't need
this giant ship all to myself, so I wanted to share this
experience with you guys, my subscribers. - I love Mr. Beast. - Subscribe to Mr. Beast. - Holy cow, this boat. - It's actually pretty nice. - Let's go, boys. Let's get it. - We're gonna go ride the carousel. - Carousel, carousel, carousel. - Where'd Chandler go? Oh. - And just when we had thought
we had seen everything here. What is this? How do humans build this stuff? Also in this giant mall,
inside of this giant ship there's a bar that comes
down from the ceiling. Wait, what are those robotic arms? - That's our bionic bar. - Oh, it's all right, buddy. - Oh.
- Oh. - Whoo. Woohoo. This is sick. - From the kids menu. - Oh, my God. - See how much you guys, my subscribers, we're enjoying this ship. - Never let go.
- Never let go. - And I had one last
surprise for my subscribers on the cruise ship. So, I had Nolan gathered
them all together. I have a big announcement for all of you. To all the subscribers
we brought here today. We're giving you a
three night free cruise. - And if you wanna be in
a video in the future, subscribe so you can join us next time. We filmed a secret Mr. Beast video that will never
be uploaded to YouTube. The only way you can watch this video is by buying a Feastables
product within the next 30 days and scanning the QR
code on the back of it. There's literally never been a
better time to buy Feastables from Walmart, Albertsons,
7-Eleven, or feastables.com. I spent over a million
dollars on this secret video. You wanna buy Feastables,
so you can watch."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM7Z-Xq8Drc,"Ages 1 - 100 Fight For $500,000",1535,20230527,en,"- Behind me are 100 people. And they range from the age one all the way through age 100. And I've trapped each of them
in their very own glass cube. The last one to leave
their cube is going to win half a million dollars. The challenge has officially begun. Let's see which age is the best. - So, I'm representing for 31. I've got the best view
and the best motivation. - You want the best?
You got it right here. - My daughter's turning
three this Saturday. Emery, daddy loves you, this is for you. - 69, feeling fine. And I gotta winning on my mind. - Boing, boing, boing. - What's your strategy
to win this challenge? Keep in mind, I have over 300 cameras set up literally everywhere, so we'll be monitoring their every move. And one of the first things I noticed was that the kids had a crazy strategy. - My strategy is to make a lot of noise, so people like don't get any sleep and they really wanna get out. - And, I can't believe
it, but it's working. The old people were not having it, and they started leaving right away. - Can somebody make that
girl stop screaming? - And even some of the kids got out because of it. - He's building up suspense.
- No! - Did you want the money?
- Yeah. - Then why did we leave? - I have good news for you. You've survived longer
than the one year old. - That, don't, come on. - Do you think this will be easy? - I am a World War II veteran. It'll be peanuts. - True.
I appreciate your service. Thank you. We're a couple hours into the challenge and 10 people have already gotten out. So, we decide to leave them
alone for the rest of the day, which caused even more people to get out. - I want to go home. I want to see my kids. Bye. - I gotta go to school. - I just don't think
it's for me at my age. - I got really bored and I miss my dog. - Here's some money for playing. - Oh, are you serious? - But, some people were
more determined to stay. - You know, I'm a big family guy. Hopefully, pay off my
sister's student debt. - I have a deal with one of my grandkids. I'm here to show him
how strong I am at 70. - I don't need a strategy,
I'm good 'til Christmas. - It's the start of day two, and only 76 people remain. Let's see how the a
hundred year old's doing. How's it going? - I'm awake! - It's the start of day two. Do you want to keep going
or do you want to get out? - I think I'm gonna quit. It's something my family
will never forget. - You fought in a World War, and competed in a Mr. Beast video. - Yes. - Going into day two,
I've been pretty good. - The money's right there. It's right there, within my reach. - Whoa, how are you growing
so much on the walls? - Chap stick. - It's always amazing to see how people fight their boredom in these last to leave challenges. Some draw on the walls with deodorant, while others build pillow forts. So, I'm gonna give them an opportunity to take this challenge to the next level. We're 24 hours in, and
it's time for a vote. In each of your rooms you'll notice a green button and a red button. And if a majority of you
press the green button, we'll do a challenge, but that will eliminate a bunch of you. If a majority of you press the red button, we won't, and we'll
just continue as usual. - I chose red. Why take unnecessary risks? - Not voting green. - I am ready to do something
and get some people out here. - Green is we do a challenge. Red it-
Okay. - Reveal the results. 63 people voted for a
challenge and 13 didn't. - I've got my game face on today. - The game is three cup monte, but we made it slightly bigger. A ball is placed under
one of these three cups. Nolan, Chandler, start moving 'em around. Whoever remembers where the
ball is, stays in the game. Everyone else is eliminated. - The guys are so cute, it's hard to keep my eyes on the cups. - Have you ever seen
someone that focused before? What's that over there? - You are unbelievably tricky. - Oh, my gosh, what's that over there? - Not falling for that. - It worked on the 82 year old. Do you have any idea which cup it's in? I guess it's up to chance. But some people lost track of the ball and had to trust their
neighbor for the answer. - It's like you blink or
you look away for a second and it's gone. - We relied on a consensus here. - New strategy.
- What? - We're not gonna tell
'em the correct thing. When they ask, it's a different color. - I trust my people, I think I'm good. - I'm nervous because I
don't wanna get kicked out. - They've been watching these cups for an hour straight. If they still know which
cup the ball is under, that's really impressive. Everyone, I need you
to lock in your votes. Hit the button that lines
up with the cup you choose. - I don't know who to trust. - Green. - He said red.
- Red. - She said blue.
- Blue. - Don't trust her! - I don't trust the
man over there, at all. - You're done, big boy, done. - Reveal what color they picked. Only three people picked green. Nolan, were those three people right? They were not. Most people picked blue. Let's see if they're right. They are! - We're out.
- We're outta here. - By the end of the challenge on day two, only 52 people still remain. And the tensions are getting higher. - We got an enemy now, the old guy. - I know, look at him. - There's friction
between these two groups. - He told me red.
She told me the truth. - These are the people
he's been talking to the whole time we're here. And they told him the wrong color. - Her and I were just playing with him, giving him the wrong color. We were just having fun with 'em. They took it the wrong way. - If you gotta win by lying, then that's not the way we want to play. - What they've done is, they've turned a bunch
of folks against them. A bunch. - At this point, you're probably wondering
how they use the bathroom. Push this down. Okay, the light outside
the cube just turned on, which means Chris is now
gonna bring you a toilet. I couldn't get plumbing
in all hundred rooms, so we have portable toilets. This is now a bathroom. Let's get out of the
bathroom, oh my goodness. - By the end of day two, almost half the contestants
have been eliminated. - It was fun to tell 'em the wrong color, 'cause they didn't know what to do. - Wait, why do you want
number 22 out so bad? - We were beefing earlier. - Tension, now, is at an all time high. - Makes her want to get out. - You know it doesn't, right? - What?
I can't hear you! - I'm hungry. Leave me alone, I'm hungry. - God, pissing me off. - Which naturally caused
more people to leave. - It's time to go home. - You got really far.
- Thank you. - By the end of day three, 54 and 74 were the biggest targets. How's it going everybody? - Woo! - We're halfway through day four, which means it's time to
vote on whether or not we do another challenge. If you vote yes, a lot of
people are gonna get out. This is not the same
as the last challenge. So, vote with caution. How's it going?
What'd you vote for? - Challenge. - You're not worried it could get you out? - I like to sow seeds of chaos. It's more fun this way. - Why are you pressing it so much? - Let's do the challenge. - All right. The results are in, and only nine voted against it. You each have a piece
of paper and a sharpie. I want you all to write a number of one of the remaining
contestants on that paper. Whoever gets the most
votes, is eliminated. 60 second timer starts now. I told you this challenge would be brutal. - This is gonna stink. That's what's going through my head. - I'll betcha they're trying
to vote me off right now. - In the last challenge, there was a lot of lying. So, now, the people that were lied to are gonna vote out the
people that lied to them, so it pays off to be honest. - What's your vote?
- 54. His cockiness and his lying. - 74, she's not a very grateful person. Somebody needs to go, would be her. - You wrote that down quick. - Yes, we got his whole block. - So, everybody's voting for 54? - Yes. We're going to see who has more influence. - Things are about to
get real interesting. - Everybody reveal your answer in three, two, one. Oh! I'm seeing a lot of same numbers up here. - There's such a big
war between 74 and 54. - The results are in. And it was actually scarily
close, within two votes. The loser is 74 with 14 votes. Nolan, can you please show 74 out. One down, now we need to
do that nine more times. - Woo! - We all just basically came
to a consensus at the same time that 10 needs to go. - He's so annoying. Like, he literally voted for me and I didn't do anything to him. - That's a strong minded
child right there. If he stayed the whole time, he could win. - The ten year old's my favorite. I really hope he stays in. - Yeah, I'm thinking
ten, I'm so sorry ten. But, if I don't vote for
you, then they'd want me out. - I'm not a hundred percent sure, but I think he voted for me. - Three, two, one. All right, everyone, show
your vote to the camera. - Savages. Savages.
- Oh, my gosh. That is a lot of tens. I'm sorry, little man. This is officially the
first decade eliminated. - You guys are sick in the head! - You outlasted this entire row. The only reason they voted you out was cause they were scared. - I felt so bad for ten, I
invited him onstage with me to co-host the rest of the challenge. - He's probably gonna kick me out. - Okay, I need every single
one of you to vote for 14. - 14, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14. - I don't know how to put this, but almost everyone voted for 14. - We have to think in terms of who's the biggest threat, and this one's gonna be tough. Get ready. - It's time to go. - The 50 year olds were
determined to eliminate people, and they had the most voting power by far. - 73 is also one of those bad apples. - 73.
15 Votes. - They got a pretty big
power block right there. - Oh, my god. The 50s might single handedly take out everybody in their 70s. - 71?
Okay. - 71 got 15 votes. - I've never been so
threatened by 50 year olds. - It's kind of scary. We lost some good friends. Hate to see them go. - I hate doing this.
It was 75. - This is insane. - I wanna say, everyone voted 69. - I feel so sorry for you. - 69, you've been voted out. - Look at what you've done. - The next person is 35, with nine votes. - We randomly chose. - And I'm sorry to say, 21. - We can only all be friends for so long. - I'm actually seeing a lot of 96, so let's go hear what she has to say. She was very close to being eliminated. - Great, this is what you want, I'm happy. - Dude, she's so cute. The fact that she's sweet, tells me that I know her
grandkids miss her at home. - My arms. My arms. - Let's see who you savages dog piled on. Show the numbers. Over half of you voted for 96. I don't understand you people. She's not the biggest threat here. - Oh. I'm sorry.
- Thank you for everything. You know, it's the way
it is, and I'm happy. You know, it's what everybody wants, and that's what's important. - This is heart wrenching. - The purge is now officially done. If you're in your cube, you survived. Because of their alliance,
the 50s made it through the entire voting game untouched. And, yet again, somehow 54 survived. - On to the next. - Either challenge or no challenge. - I gotta vote no challenge,
'cause I can wait it out. - It's time for another challenge vote. - I know for a hundred percent I can win if I do no challenges
the rest of the time. - I vote yes for challenge. My chances are getting better and better just like everybody else's. - I could wait it out. My house would be paid off. I'm ready to retire. This could be it for me. - 20 of you voted for a challenge. Why are you gambling? You guys are crazy. Inside of each of your
cubes is a Jenga tower. We're gonna pull blocks out one at a time, and, if your tower
falls, you're eliminated. Pull your first block. It can be any block besides the red ones. We're gonna keep doing this until there is only ten people remaining. Pull the second block out. Looks like no one has been eliminated yet. Let's do another one. - My heartbeat is so fast. - I'm just waiting to hear
the crash of Jenga blocks. - That was close- Oh, my gosh, I called it. One person down, 14 more to be eliminated. This is gonna be crazy. And, while they're pulling pieces, I wanna tell you about the Shop app. It's the most amazing way
to shop from your phone. The Shop app makes shopping extremely fun. From buying Feastables bars, to e-bikes, to whatever else you're interested in, it's super easy. And, when you're ready to buy, you can speed through
checkout using Shop Pay. - It's not coming out. - The Shop app uses AI technology to scan hundreds of millions of products, and recommend the ones best for you. I'm so nervous. - So am I. - Oh. Oh, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait. - I can't touch- - Oh. Shop will even track all
your packages in one place so you'll know exactly
when each of them arrive. And, remember, we're doing this until there are ten people left. - Yeah, whoa! - What are you doing?
- Nothing. - You can't be trusted. - Oh. I bumped into the thing. - Yeah, I noticed. - Only one more to go. - It all comes down to this. She could be the last person. - I can't believe this hasn't
hit the ground already. - I know, whoa. Bro, your tower has tilted 30 times. I can't look, I can't, oh, I gotta look. But I can't look, I gotta look. - Come on, Brenda, think
about the backyard Jenga. - Backyard Jenga don't have Jimmy in my- - That is the final elimination. - I can't believe it. I'm top 10. 90 gone, ten left, let's go. - If mom wins the $500,000, we are going to Disney World. - Download the Shop app right now. We're gonna be selling Jenga blocks and other parts from
this set on the Shop app, which I'll tell you more
about at the end of the video. This challenge has eliminated
everyone above the age of 60. The right side of the map is a wasteland. And, now that 15 people just got out, we have to tear down 15 cubes. There's no way they're gonna vote for another challenge tomorrow. Look at how many people have gotten out. Every single one of these
Xs used to be a person. - There was a human right here. - There is no one around me. - I'm the youngest one here. - If I leave, I leave on a challenge. I'm not leaving walking out. - I have not come this far to give up. - I'm gonna let you guys say
your votes over the microphone. Do you want a challenge? - Absolutely. - Yes or no? - Yes.
- Yes. - Challenge. - Yes or no? - Yes.
- We're doing a challenge. - Mic drop.
- Mic drop. - In our Squid Games video, you guys loved the marble
game, so we brought it back. Just like last time, the
contestants are playing one v. one against their neighbor. Each player's given ten marbles, and they choose what game to play. By the end of 30 minutes, only the person with 20 marbles moves on. These guys just wanted
to get in over with. - This is a $500,000 coin flip. - Oh.
- Oh. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm
so sorry, it is heads. - First to two wins, right? It's up to you guys. Oh, my God, sunk it, that's one point. Oh. If you make it into any
bucket, you win right here. - Let's go. - Oh, my God, he won it. - I'm sorry, buddy. - All good, all good. - Count 'em up. Make sure you have 20. - Got ten blue, nine red. - You're missing a marble? - Can you count again? - 19, you are one short. - I'm not holding onto any. - Interesting. There's only seven minutes left, so if you care for this
man, you should find it. - Where is it? - You're currently at 18 marbles. And you're at two marbles. - I'm leaving this in your hands. - It's okay. - I'm so sorry. Oh, good. - Whoa. There might be a comeback. - It might be. - I found it. - Really? - Yeah.
- Oh, really? - It was in my bed sheet. - He has one more marble. If you win with that one
marble, that'd be crazy. I thought that was in. - That's it.
- Oh. - I can officially step out now. Oh, that feels so bad. - This keeps going back and forth. Rock, paper, scissors, shoot. Rock, paper, scissors, shoot. Rock, paper, scissors. Hey, remember, you said we'd both go home, so one of us is gonna have
to decide a different game. - Rock, paper, scissors for
half a minute is bad too. - Okay, this is for all the marbles. We're gonna do all or nothing. Does that sound fair? - This is for all the marbles?
- Yeah. - But you have 14 marbles and he has six. Why are you gambling? - All or nothing, a minute and a half. - Hurry up. - Rock, paper, scissors, turn! - I got 'em all. - 54 escaped elimination again. 30 seconds remain. - Okay, we're done to the last two. It was the same position as
this only a couple minutes ago. - And, the thing is, a
minute ago it was me. - Is there anything you wanna
say to each other before this? - I love you.
- I love you too. Let's just do this, right? - It's okay, congratulations. Can I hug her?
- Yeah. - I lost to an amazing person. - It was rough. - The only people left are 23, 40, 43, 52, and 54. - Look at the graveyard of Xs. These were all cubes
like mine at the start. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't nervous. - Things have been getting
a little more intense. - Today is my daughter's birthday. It's just hitting home now
that I'm not gonna be there. - Can you all hear me? - Yes. - When we started, there was a 100 of you, and now we're down to five. Do you wanna reduce it even
further with a challenge? - Yes! - All right, but you guys chose this. In this challenge, the 95 contestants who have already left will vote. And the three of you with
the most votes are gone. - Wow. - I'm definitely worried
about this challenge. - Certain people here have kind of brushed people the wrong way. - You have no idea what
people think of you. - At this point, I'm rather glad that I didn't really make any enemies. - Do you think the people
that lost liked you? - For the most part. - Are you willing to bet
half a million dollars that they liked you? - I don't know about that one. - Do you think the people that
were eliminated liked you? - No.
- What's not to like? - Let's find out. We literally asked every single one of the
95 eliminated people who they want gone. - Heart's about to jump outta my throat. - How many votes does it say you got, Joe? - Ten. - Which is not enough to be eliminated! He's one of the two that passed. Which means only one of
these four cubes remains. So, I'm bad with this stuff, do you wanna, you wanna handle it?
You got it. - 23.
- Yes? - You were, in fact, eliminated. - No. To lose it in top five, when I've come as far, was super painful. - I really didn't expect 23 to go. - And, now, only one
of these three remain. Do you think it's you? - I hope so. - That didn't sound confident. You received 15 votes. - Oh. - Oh, this is brutal. - Love you, Chris. - I'm not gonna lie, losing
out on that was crushing. After spending, roughly, seven days here, and getting that close
to that grand prize, and not getting it, it hurts. - And, now, the two of you. All right, we'll come over here. - This is tense. Very tense. - 54. - I got the most votes, I know. - Wait, how'd you know that? - I don't trust the
man over there, at all. - You're done, big boy, done. - I just know. - Yeah, you did.
You got 37 votes. - So, I'm in?
- Which means, 52, you passed! - I'm in! This was a once in a lifetime chance. - I've got a 50% chance at
winning half a million dollars. - As a reward for making
it to the final two, I have one last surprise for you. What do you think it is? - Oh, I have no idea. - What is this right here? - That's for my daughter. - Today's her birthday? Well, let's see what comes
through the curtains. - Don't do this to me. Oh, my God. - I'm not gonna let you miss her birthday. - Is that your daddy? - Regardless if you win or lose, we're proud of you, you can do this. - Good job! - This is the fam. - Hi! - I couldn't ask for anything else. That was my everything right there. - Yeah. I've got this now. - Only ages 52 and 40 remain, and they've been living in
these cubes for over a week. - Day eight. It's been a wild ride. - Here I am. I can't believe it. Every challenge I've
said, I thought I was out. I thought I was out. I made it. - It's a lot more feasible now in my mind, because it's not me
versus 98 other people. It's me versus one person. - All these Xs were
cubes with people in 'em, and everybody's gone now,
and it's just Joe and I. - Another day here is not
gonna make somebody quit. To come down to something actually forcing one of us to leave. - I give them a chance to say no to a challenge, but- - Oh, my, what should we do? - I can't believe they chose a challenge. They are taking a half
a million dollar gamble. Inside one of these briefcases, is the check for $500,000. And everyone on set is blindfolded, including the cameramen,
while I mix up the cases. I promise this will make
sense in just a minute. The briefcases are now mixed. And, because you guys chose a challenge, you can step outta your
cubes and meet in the middle. Half a million dollars is
about to go to 52 or 40. I'm going to flip a coin to decide who gets to look inside
of their briefcase, making them the only person on set that knows where the money is. - It's a game of bluffery. - That's right, because, then, it's up to the other person to choose which briefcase they want to take home. Heads or tails? - Heads. - Tails. Whenever you're ready,
look inside your briefcase. I don't even want to know what's in there. I can't stand the burden. 52 now has to decide whether she's gonna keep her
briefcase or steal his. - Joe, do you have
$500,000 in your briefcase? - Yes. - Joe, are you lying? - What do you think? - Was there anything
else in the briefcase, other than the money? - I saw the Mr. Beast logo. - You saw a check in there? - Yes. - Joe, are you honest? - You spent enough time
with me, what do you think? - This is so nerve wracking. Half a million dollars on the line. Is she going to keep her
briefcase or take his? - Wow. - It's a big decision. - What do you think, as of
right now, in your head? Do you think it's in there? - I don't think it's in there. I think I have it. - I'm so nervous. - I'm, actually, my heart is beating. I'm actually feeling anxious for you guys. - And you swear that the
money is in your case? - Yes. - I don't think it's in there. I think I'm gonna pick my case. - So, you're gonna keep this? - Locked in? - All right, Joe, what
is inside your briefcase? Oh, my God! - I knew it!
- Yeah! - And you told her it was in there. - I did. - This man literally said he had it. Oh, my gosh, what a crazy play. What is wrong with you? - He told the truth, and he got it. We said all along, the good guys can win. - It pays off to be honest. Even though you didn't win, we still wanna give you $10,000, and your family a trip to Disneyland to make losing a little better. They're still gonna go. - Yay! - We took items from the set and turned them into collectible pieces that we are selling for only one penny. And you have to act quickly, because there's only a
limited amount of 'em, and they're gonna sell out fast. Click the link below and

out of 1,000 deaf people we're gonna help hear again. And she hasn't heard her mother's voice in four years.
(chime clicks) Can you hear?
(gentle music) - I love you.
(heartfelt music) - [Jimmy] Aww. Next we helped Kayleah. - What?
- Sudy. - Whoa!
- And even entire families hear their loved ones again. But they are only a few of the 1,000 people
(shutter clicking) that we're gonna help hear again today. We got our hands on over $3 million worth of cutting-edge hearing technology, that unlike old hearing aids, analyzes people's specific hearing needs, allowing them to hear again without causing any damage.
(chime pinging) - Can you hear me talking now? - Yes.
- Oh my God. What? He can hear me.
- [Jimmy] I'm gonna cry. - [Daughter] You just saved my dad's life. - [Jimmy] And our 10th person was Aisha. - I used to watch him like a lot. Like I'd like....
- Used to?! - No. Stop.
- What happened? Hey, you know what? This is over. - No, (laughing) no, no, no. - Go ahead. Do a test.
- Mommy? - [Jimmy] She can't hear you yet, but she will in three, two, one. (check mark clicks)
- Hello? (mother gasps)
- I can hear my baby girl. - I can hear my voice in
my left ear now. (laughs) - [Jimmy] How's it sound? Ha ha ha, he's dancing. - Oh my God.
- This is amazing. - Can you hear that?
- I can. (shutter clicking)
- [Jimmy] At this point, we've helped over 40 people hear again. But on top of that, we wanted to give them a little surprise. This is $10,000, and it's yours. (recipient laughing)
There you go. We also want to give you
$10,000 to make this day a little bit better. - Are you serious?
- Yeah. Just don't have a heart attack, please. (heart beating) Which is better? Hearing or the 10 grand? - The hearing, 'cause I can hear my baby. - Do you watch the channel?
- Mm-hmm. - Can you guys close your eyes and can I borrow you for one second? Can you tell them you
guys just won $10,000? Okay. Open your eyes. - You won $10,000. - Oh my God.
(recipient laughs) - I'd get home and have a heart attack. - Please don't, what is with everyone and having heart attacks this video? Turn around and look at the camera, and you just go ""Subscribe.""
- Subscribe. - There you go. Ivy's
the next big YouTuber. Why don't we give you $10,000, as well? Here you go. - [Recipient] The hearing aids was enough, but that is awesome. - Not only did we want to help you here, we also wanted to give
you $10,000 on top of it. (senior gasping)
- I'm rich! - What are you gonna spend the money on? - Jelly? - You mentioned you have 12 grandkids? Now, um.
- Oh! - In here is $12,000.
- No way. - So now you can give a grand to each of your grandkids. You can just tell me my
jokes are dumb. Here you go. - What do you want me to do with this? - Is there something you wanna buy? - Lots of things I want to buy. - Well, now you can. (laughing) When we were talking earlier, they mentioned you guys
enjoyed jet skiing. Is there anything you want but you don't wanna spend the money on? - Jet ski for him. His jet ski broke down. Who are you?
- MrBeast. Seen any of the show?
- Can I hug you? - Wait, did you just realize who I am? - Yeah!
- Oh. - I had no idea.
- Yeah. I'm the one who helped you hear. Well, now that you know who I am, can I surprise you guys with something? - Yeah.
- Okay, I went out, and I bought a brand-new
jet ski for you guys. - I was gonna sell my
wife to try to get one. - Oh, really? I got you.
- Thank you so, so much. - [Jimmy] And while we were
busy helping more people, I sent Nolan to give a gift to
one of our youngest patients. - I've got some custom
pink hearing aids for you. - Look at those. - Listen, what do you say
we go get some more toys? (child laughs) What do you say, we just
go to the Toy Alley? You just go crazy, all right?
- Yeah. - It's Jimmy's money.
- I'm taking all his money. (Nolan laughs)
(upbeat music) This man. Yes! - Ooh. What's that?
- Do you like the sound? (toy screaming)
- We need more. Orbeez.
(scanner beeping) This time, my best day
ever! Thank you, MrBeast! - This is darnedest thing I ever heard of. - Pretty cool, isn't it?
- And I mean, my word, you know?
- [Technician] You can hear? - I can hear really good.
- I hear myself pretty good. (upbeat music) - Try talking to him from back there. - Colton, who's the
best quarterback, ever? - Peyton Manning.
- He hears very well. (all laughing)
- To test your new hearing, we got you tickets to the upcoming championship basketball game, for you and your whole family to go to. (family laughing, exclaiming) What better way to break
in your new hearing than going to a Taylor Swift concert? (recipient laughs)
You can experience it with your new hearing. - [Announcer] Welcome to
Houston, and hello friends. - [Father] These are like
the best seats we've ever had for a basketball game.
- There it is! (buzzer ringing) (crowd cheering) (rousing music)
- Thank you, MrBeast! - But we didn't only want to help people in the United States, which is why we flew to Mexico
to help 200 deaf people. Come on. Leo Bardo and Selmai have always wanted to hear their daughter's voice. But are unable to afford
hearing technology. However, today that's about to change. - Their saying repeatedly,
over sign language, they're so excited to hear
her say ""mama and papa,"" for the first time.
(gentle music) They're flicking 'em on. Okay. 3, 2, 1. - Papa.
(gentle piano music) - [Interpreter] Papa? Papa?
- You can hear? You can hear?
- Great. - Yeah.
- Thank you for doing this for me. Thank you. - [Jimmy] You should be able to hear now. What's it like? Aww. Aww.
(triumphant music) She hasn't heard properly for 67 years. 3, 2, 1. (Jimmy speaking Spanish) - Bien.
- Yeah? (patient speaking Spanish)
- Oh. How much different is it?
- Mucho. - Wow. - Wow. - Oh.
(patient exclaiming) (recipients laughing)
(intense dramatic music) - [Jimmy] Great. And we
also went to Guatemala, (recipient laughing)
Brazil. And we also helped hundreds
of people in South Africa, Malawi, and Indonesia. And I learned while filming this video that providing hearing isn't
the only way to connect people. - [Together] Go team! - [Jimmy] Sign language connects people whether they can hear or not. But access to learning sign language is still very limited in many places. So we're gonna donate
$100,000 to organizations around the world that are
teaching people sign language. But aside from that, we still have our final
person left to help. (slow piano music) (check mark clicking) - Subscribe.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WEAJ-DFkHE,World's Most Expensive Flights!,740,20230401,en,"- We're gonna fly on this jet that costs half a million
dollars per flight and we're also gonna fly
on a $25,000 private jet, a $10,000 first-class seat,
a blimp, and so much more. But before I show you
what it's like to fly on some of the most luxurious
plane on the planet, we're gonna fly on the
cheapest plane in the world. It's really rickety. Here's the dollar. I'm very nervous. - Nothing to be nervous about. I've done this half a dozen times. - You've done this six times? (lively music) (engine whirring) Why does this sound like
a lawn mower engine? (Doug laughing) Time for ride on world's
cheapest plane ticket. (lively music) Oh boy. Oh my... Oh my gosh, round up. We're going so fast.
- Come on, get it. - That does not sound safe.
- Nah ah. (wind whooshing)
- They almost hit the camera. - Whoo!
- What are you doing? - Keep your seatbelt on.
- Uh, you just focused on keeping me alive, Doug.
- I'm trying. (engine whirring)
- All right, he's in there. - All right, dibs on the channel. - I got what I need.
You can land whenever. - (laughing) No.
- Doug, come on. Doug, please. - That guy pays my bills. Be careful. - And if you guys think this is crazy, wait until later in the video
when we have the world's most expensive plane ticket on the planet. - Wait a minute, you're
making me feel bad. - Oh my god, he's coming in hot. (engine whirring) - [Doug] Get ready to land. (metal clanking)
- Almost. - [Group] Yeah. - We're on the ground, we survive. - [Person] Our next plane is the $1,000 first class plane ticket. - But here's the thing, boys. I bought all the first class seats, so, sit wherever you want. - Would you like some miracle mist lotion? - Why? - Because first class,
baby, fine dining, huh. - [Person] Each of us
has our own seat and TV. The ticket also comes with a decent meal, a free bag of toiletries and pajamas. - Do we get to take all this home with us - [Person] And during longer flights... - Recline. We should recline into a bed. - I feel like I'm in a
coffin, which I like. - Yeah, this is crazy. - [Person] And best of all... - My favorite part
about this $1,000 plane, I don't need to speak to Nolan. - I don't like this glass
'cause it like separates me. I'm all alone back here. - That is the exact reason why I like it. - [Person] The only downside
is that you don't get a lot of privacy. - [Chris] It's really
awkward filming a video with all these people walking by. - [Person] So, let's
see what a plane ticket 10 times more expensive will feel like. - And now, the $10,000 plane ticket. Oh man, this is nice. I have unlimited legroom here. Look, let's start off by
analyzing what we get. A tablet, a giant touchscreen TV, my own in-seat drink bar, snacks. This isn't Feastables
chocolate. I want a refund. - We're getting connected to the Wi-Fi. We might have paid $10,000 for our seat but we still have to pay $20 for Wi-Fi. - It's not free? - Now, we're taking off,
which is pretty crazy because I can literally watch it on my TV and because it's a 16-hour
flight, I get to take a... Look at how nice this bathroom is. You have a sink, a
toilet, and then a shower. That is crazy. Look at that. We are 30,000 feet in the
air and I can take a shower - [Person] On top of that,
me and the boys can order as much gourmet food as we want. And that's not all, we
save the best for last. - Hey, how's it going? - [Person] There's a private lounge in the back of the plane. - Hey, Jimmy. - Yeah.
- Ow. - You're not dreaming. - That was the $10,000 plane ticket. Point the camera up and down. And now we're at the $25,000 plane ticket that is up these stairs. That's right, there's floors. - This is insane. - This is crazy. We're gonna be sitting above other people. - Oh my god. - Now, this is your room. - [Person] For $25,000,
you get two massive rooms. - Oh, this is crazy. I've
never seen anything like this. - Holy... - [Person] Our space on this plane is literally four times
bigger than the last one. I've never seen a plane
where I can comfortably do jumping jacks. Look at this. - [Person] We also get
two chairs, a ton of TVs. - There are more TVs in this one room than all of the other planes we've been on - [Person] Food served by a
personal flight attendant. - Why is it that after
a certain price point, they always give you a caviar? - And the bathroom.
- Can we talk about something? This bathroom is like a disappointment. No shower, no heated
floors, half the size. I think the $10,000 flight
was a better price point. - Would you pay this kind of money for a single flight? - I wouldn't recommend this.
I would recommend a car. - Buy a car instead. - And now, the best part of
the room, a queen size bed. Ooh. - Why don't they just
make every seat a bed? - Bro, instead of three
seats side by side, just put a bunk bed with three bed. (bright music) (audio squeaks) (hand thudding) - Good morning. That
was really good sleep. - Karl, wake up. We're gonna land. - I slept like a rock. That was the world's most
expensive commercial flight. Time for private flights.
(screen whooshing) This is the $100,000 plane. - This thing's huge. - At this price point,
you get the entire plane. (group cheering indistinctly) - Private, private.
- Oh, it's like a yacht. - This is wild.
- This is unbelievable. - You wanna know the craziest part? This is just one of four rooms. - [Karl] There's more to the plane, I thought this was it. - Guys, come over here. What room is this? - [Person] This is literally
another lounge area with a bunch of snacks and a huge TV. And if you're feeling tired, you get your own private bedroom. - Dude, what? Wee. - This is like a hotel. - [Person] And last but
not least, the bathroom. - Three, shut your mouth
right now. Shut it. - Whoa.
- This is insane. There's a seat in the bathroom. Dibs - Have you ever even seen
a jet half this size? - No.
- Never. - What do we talk about
while on our private jet? - Well, I'll tell you, last year I had sold the (indistinct). - Oh no. Oh, wait. I just realized I'm taking off backwards (water bottle thuds)
(GoPro thuds) - Whoa.
- GoPro. - I didn't realize we were taking off. - Not the camera. Stop! - This is crazy. Whoa, oh. (Karl whistling)
(group laughing) - Bro flew.
- Oh my God. (person laughing)
- I can just roll back. - Oh, turbulence. All right, I'm going to sit down. - This might be the best bathroom yet. This is the toilet. On the toilet you can watch TV. - Hey, Nolan, I hope you feel
comfortable in the bathroom. - What's going on? I'm so confused. (door thuds)
No, no. (laughs) - He's never getting out. - (gasps) What?
- Oh wow. - I have steak, mashed
potatoes, and veggies. And you guys inspired me a little bit, so I brought some pizza. - [Group] Yeah! (upbeat music) - This is my favorite plane
because it has YouTube but we didn't pop up
first, so now, it's not. - You can tell this is a rich person bed 'cause there's like 500 pillows. This one outta here. That one outta here. (singer sings in foreign language) - I'm gonna fly this thingy. - And that's the beauty of flying private. You can do whatever you want whenever. Karl's flying the plane,
Chandler's jamming out the pizza. Chris is taking a nap and I don't even know where Nolan went. There's no layovers when you fly private and there's no TSA, so
you save tons of time. Hence why? Basically, every rich person
you know owns a private jet. - Hey, guys.
- Yeah. - We're gonna land soon. - Karl, let me out. (hand thudding) - Where about... We're gonna land? You
gotta let me out, bro. - Oh, oh.
- Oh my God. That was the opposite smooth. - Wait, wait. Is Nolan
still in the bathroom? - I don't know, really.
- Karl, go let him out. - Oh, oh.
- How was your flight? - Still better than the $1000 plane. (Karl laughing) - And now, the $300,000 blimp. I'll unblur it in a second. Before I remove your blindfolds, what do you think is on
the side of the blimp? - Is it Nolan's phone number? - Did you do Nolan's phone number? - That would be funny.
- Next time. - Take off your blindfolds.
Turn turnaround. (person scream)
(MrBeast laughs) (group laughing)
- I heart Karl's mom. Hold up. Why? He really loves my mom. - No, Karl, he hearts your
mom. He doesn't love your mom. That'd be weird.
- No, I love her. - Oh. (blowing raspberries) - [Chandler] Dude, am
I pushing it right now? - Ooh, it's like moving. - This giant aircraft can literally just be pulled by a rope. And you might be wondering how
did I afford this giant blimp and pay six figures to wrap it? ZipRecruiter, a recruiting
platform that I use to hire people like editors,
cameramen, and accountants. Let's see if it stops
floating when I get on it. (metal stairs thuds) - That's gains, dude. - Does that mean I'm fat? - It means you work out a lot.
- Or I'm fat. ZipRecruiter is where people go to discover their next great job. If this blimp crashes, then I die. - Uh-huh. - You guys could just use
ZipRecruiter to find a new job. - That'll make it so
much easier. Thanks, man. - I feel like I don't
like this conversation. - Shh, shh. All right, let's do this. Goodbye, Chandler. Goodbye, forever.
(door thuds) - I think I heard forever. - [Chris] He could have promoted anything and he chose Karl's mom. - I'm terrified. This
ain't picking up speed. - Well, we'll see you at the race. - [Person] Oh, and I forgot to mention, we're flying this blimp
over 150,000 people at the world's largest race car event. And Karl has no idea. - Before I die in this blimp, I wanna tell you guys about ZipRecruiter. We recently made a job
posting on ZipRecruiter and I'm gonna call one of the
candidates and interview them. (phone ringing)
Hey, Thomas. I saw your application on
ZipRecruiter. Can you hear me? - [Thomas] Yes, I can. Is this MrBeast? - Yeah, I'm MrBeast, it doesn't matter. - [Thomas] Sorry, I can't
barely hear you right now. - Yeah, because we're on a blimp. How long have you been an editor for? - [Thomas] I've been an
editor for about 10 years. - Do you think you can improve our videos? - [Thomas] I think with a strong team and a little creative innovation, I can definitely make your videos better. - Okay, not bad. Send me
some examples of your work. If like Thomas, you want a
shot to come work for us, click the link in the description or go to ziprecruiter.com/mrbeast. We're gonna look at every
single person that applies. (crowd cheering)
(cars revving) We are now over the Daytona 500 which is one of the busiest events ever. - [Karl] You couldn't
have put something better on the blimp.
- No, this is perfect. - This is wrong. (laughing) - [Chris] Can they see us? - [MrBeast] You can see 'em.
(screen dings) - Karl, I can confirm. Everyone
loves your mom down here. - I love Karl's mom. - Everybody's like, ""We love..."" - [Crowd] I love Karl's mom. - Karl's mom, if you're
watching, you're a lovely lady. - [Crowd] We love Karl's mom. - [Karl] You're a psycho. - [MrBeast] For your mom. (audio thuds) - [Person] And now, the most
expensive private plane ticket on the planet. (upbeat music) - Hi, welcome board. I suggest you taking your shoes off. That carpet's actually $2 million. - She's like, ""I suggest it, really hard."" - [MrBeast] And by square feet, this is bigger than our houses. - [Person] It's almost
impossible to imagine how big this jet actually is. - Right here is a bedroom. - Wow.
- A bedroom. Another bedroom, another
bedroom. Keep going. This is for the crew, another bedroom. - Hoo!
- What'd you find? - My dibs? - [Person] The bedrooms on this plane are way more extravagant. Gold plated sinks, multiple showers. - Wait, what's in there?
- That's the toilet. - [Person] This plane comes
with its own theater room, a lounge that can seat it up to 12 people. - [MrBeast] And then over
here is the living room. - This is like a bigger couch
than what I have in my house. - I just want you to know you've only seen a third of the plane so far. - There's more. - [Chris] What? Oh, got some good stuff. - You can call flight
attendants in your bedroom. - If we could do this every time we fly, I'd live in the air. Whoa, whoa, what is that? - Sorry, I'm turning
the lights on and off. - How did I miss this room? Like we walked around the whole plane - And in case you thought
you saw everything, there's also massages on this plane. How is it, Karl? - It's amazing. - So, I really just shouldn't. (glass shattering)
(Chris giggling) - Gentlemen, how were we
able to afford this plane? - I would say only our fans. - [Person] And because of
that, we invited a bunch of random subscribers on this half a million-dollar plane ride. - Have you ever flown
on a private jet before? - No. This is my first time. - And it's the most
expensive one on the planet. - I've never seen anything
like this on a plane. Like this is crazy. - Ma'am, what is this right here? - That's gas station chocolate. - Can you just throw it? Okay. (chocolates thudding)
- I didn't think she'd literally throw 'em.
(stewardess laughs) This is the chocolate you need
to serve from now on, okay? - Got it. It's called Feastables, It's the highest rated
chocolate on the planet. - [Karl] What the heck is over this way? - [Chris] Yo, this gotta be a secret room. That's where the crew is. We just got a bunch of
funny looks. (chuckles) - Attention, boys.
We're about to take off. Fasten your seat belts, stop
being hooligans. Thank you. (head thuds)
(Nolan screams) (group laughs) Typically, what kind of people
fly on a plane like this? - Business people. How do my dumb friends compare? - It's pretty dumb, I guess, I'd say. (MrBeast laughs) - [Person] At this price point, they serve the highest quality
food anytime you want it and anywhere on the plane. Even in your own private master suite. - You want some? (audio smooching)
(group laughing) - Do you guys even know where we're going? - [Group] No. - We're taking you all to Disney World and we're gonna give you two days of all expense paid trips
to do whatever you want. (group indistinctly cheering) - No way. - So, if you wanna fly

- Get me outta this rope. (siren wailing) (person grunts)
(lever clicks) - What you do? (person grunts) - [Chandler] I can't get out. - [Mr. Beast] Later boys. I left you a car in the woods. (suspenseful music) - What? Are you out? - This video is gonna be the craziest video you've ever seen. We have a real tank, an entire carnival, I'm blowing up a bank, and so much more all to
escape this real assassin. You wanna watch this video. - Oh my God, he's just driving away. - [Assassin] We gotta hurry guys. - I'm gonna stab that guy. - There's a car somewhere in the woods we have to find. - [Assassin] Guys, there's the car. - [Karl] Are you sure this one's for you? - Pretty sure.
(people laughs) - [Chandler] Go, go, go. - And now we're arriving
at the train station. There are dozens of train cars
in this massive warehouse. It's going to take him forever to find me. Inside this Cars backpack
is not only a hundred grand but also a tracker giving
him my real time location. - Okay, I found Jimmy. He seems to be stopped at like
a warehouse just up ahead. - What's it look like
around the warehouse? - It seems like where all the trains go. - Yeah.
(Karl chuckles) - How did Jimmy find an
assassin for this anyway? - I found Jimmy, he didn't find me. (suspenseful music) - Giving the assassin a car made him think this would be easy, but it's time for a reality check. (screen whooshes)
Chris, are you in the tank? - Yeah, where did we get a tank from? - Don't worry about that. When the assassin and the
boys are in the warehouse destroy their car. - Roger that. Over and out. - So, I've seen the other
guys that chased Jimmy. He's gonna be ready there for us. So, you can point and
laugh and call us nerds. Well, that ain't gonna happen this time. All right guys, we're pulling in. And we're gonna get right
up next to the building. And then we're gonna slip in
that open door over there. - He's so intent. There's a camera. There's
a camera right there. Right there. (intense music) (suspenseful music) - Let's see if he's back that way. - [Chandler] Let's go. - Chris, they're inside the
warehouse, you know what to do. - Roger that. Bravo six going dark.. Destroy the car. (Chris screaming) (tank whirring)
(graphics thump) (laughs) Oh, my God. - Chris, how's the flattening going? (Chris screaming) - [Assassin] What is going on? - [Chandler] How did I not see this? - [Assassin] Is this a door? - [Jimmy] We gotta go, we gotta go. Come on.
- Hey, something's definitely in there. (suspenseful music) (glass shattering) - Right here is our getaway car. (glass shattering) Go, go, go. - [Assassin] Go, go, go, go. (object clattering) (van crashing) - [Jimmy] Holy crap. Get us outta here. - [Assassin] Go, go, go. - Whoo! Was that epic? That was insane. It's gone. We gotta get to the car. Let's go. All right. Oh, no. Are you kidding me? - What?
- They ran over our car with a tank. - I ran over your car with a tank. - Jimmy.
- What up? - Our car is literally
a pancake right now. - Yeah, you can Uber to the next location or you can buy a new car. Up to you.
(screen whooshes) - [Assassin] Is that our Uber? Hello. We're right behind him, step on it. All right guys, he's on
the highway traveling east. - Oh, he's just running down that highway. He's going. Where are we? - We are far.
- Oh. - Now we're at the hotel
where we rented every room. So, these are our room keys. (laughs) I'll even there for the
assassin, I don't need 'em. And while we're waiting for
the assassin on the 20th floor, we have over a hundred cameras monitoring every inch of the hotel. - I've seen his tracker stop here. This place is huge. Probably a million rooms in it. He's not gonna get away from us again. Alright, fellas. Tracker's telling me he's inside. - Oh, what is this?
- This doesn't look right. - We got room keys. (audio thudding)
10th floor. - Is there a doofus on the line? - You're not very stealthy. Since you just walkied? me, that means you're within
walkie-talkie range. Which means you're now in the hotel which I didn't know you were in. - That's my bad.
- Oh. - [Jimmy] I'm hiding in one of
over 200 rooms in this hotel. I also put a little
something in every room. Good luck.
(assassin gulps) - I knew it. (cap thuds) - I just want to get up there quick and just get on him as fast as possible. - [Karl] Let's do this. Here we go. Do you hear this? (person screaming) (lock clicking) What is not in here? - [Assassin] Nope, this it ain't guys. (relaxing music) (door clicks) (elegant trumpet music) He's not in here, let's go. - [Jimmy] Oh, they are on
the 10th floor, oh my gosh. Mr. Assassin, look up at that camera. - How about this one, Jimmy? (shoe smacks) - We still have a hundred other cameras. (footsteps thumping) - Jimmy. (footsteps thumping) Coming in, Jimmy. - [Karl] What's up guys? (footsteps thumping) No way. (footsteps thumping)
(object thudding) - [Assassin] Jimmy. - [Karl] 18. - What floor are they on? - 18.
- 18. - 18? Oh, wait a minute. I might need to (hands rustling)
get ready. Mr. Assassin, here's the deal. You're running out of time and we both know you're never
gonna find me without a hint. I'll give you the exact
location to me in this hotel, if you tie up Chandler
and Karl in room 1802. - [Assassin] Yeah, I'll tie these guys up. - Don't talk to me until you do that. (walkie-talkie explodes)
I hope that didn't break, 'cause I need to talk to him. - [Assassin] Oh, my legs. - [Karl] Oh, man. - [Jimmy] Hey, Karl. - Yes, Jimmy. - I want you to know it's not personal. - It feels pretty personal. - Alright, let's go. - I'm so tired, I'm not gonna fight it. - I know we didn't help you much. (Chandler coughs)
And we let Jimmy get away. - I hope you get him. Stab him good. - Little do they know I'm literally two floors
above them right now. - Yeah, it's nothing personal guys. All right, Jimmy. These guys ain't going nowhere. - Mr. Assassin, here's your hint. I'm on the 20th floor. - Go.
- Do it for your daughter. - And now that he knows where I'm at I'm gonna try to do an ad
read without getting stabbed. TurboTax is the number one way to get the biggest tax refund possible. On average last year, people get over $3,000
on their tax refunds. That's a lot of money. Can you gimme like one minute
to finish this ad read? (footsteps thumping)
(crickets chirping) He didn't respond. I should probably start moving. TurboTax will do your
taxes, wherever you are. Even if you're running from an assassin. (door thuds) Last year, TurboTax helped
people get over $113 billion in tax refund. (alarm blaring) Oh, God, that means he's up here. All right.
(footsteps thumping) Come on.
(button clicking) (elevator chimes)
Here with TurboTax you can be confident your taxes are done right. (alarm blaring) And you're probably wondering if there was an elevator, why didn't he take it
all the way to the top? (elevator chimes)
Well, 'cause I hid it with a secret wall. (wall thuds) (grunts) That hurts. A little too good of a secret wall. (bag thudding) (alarm blaring)
(suspenseful music) Whoo! Don't wait until
April 18th to do your taxes. Click the link description and get your tax refund
right now with TurboTax. Doing ad read while
running from an assassin is very stressful. Mr. Assassin. - Jimmy. - Listen to this real quick. (door clanks) That's my door to my
getaway vehicle later, nerd. (walkie-talkie thuds) - He just ninja flipped outta here again. (screen whooshes) - This time we're making
our exit in a Lamborghini. Tareq, what up. - Wait, what are you doing?
- An assassin's currently running down 20 flights
of stairs to stab me. - Oh, well we gotta go. - You're the driver. - All right, hold on, I need to learn how to drive this thing. - I don't even know how we
got down there so quick. Part of me wishes I still
have the boys right now. - Is this your first time
driving a Lamborghini? - Yes.
- Oh, my God, whoa. - We gotta get back on our ride. - We're going to the helicopter. It's gonna fly us to a bank and then we're gonna blow up the bank. (graphic thumps)
(bag thuds) - Whoo. (helicopter whirring)
(person speaking indistinctly) See you at the next location - Hey, stop, stop, stop. (helicopter whirring) Just missed him. Let's go. Let's go. Hundred grand. His tracker's moving so fast. Can't believe he's in
a helicopter right now. - The helicopter put me way ahead and now the assassin has
less than three hours to win a hundred grand. - That's the bank?
- For now it is. Oh, God. Let's see if he can stab me while I'm hiding in this double
reinforced steel bank vault. (walkie-talkie thuds) - Tracker stopped, luckily
he didn't get too far. Now I have an opportunity
to stab him before midnight and get my money.
- How's it going? - Well, we're here. - I'm in the bank vault but I don't think you have
enough time to break in. Good luck - Bank vault. Let's do it. Bank's open late. (suspenseful music) (door slams) - He just kicked out a door. (doors slamming) I think he's literally lost his mind. (doors slamming)
(suspenseful music) (timer beeping) Oh, my God. (hands thudding) - You in there, Jimmy? (vault lock clanking) (door thuds) (Nolan laughs) - (laughs) He fell for it. He fell for it. - It worked. - It worked. Mr. Assassin, there's two bank vaults and you picked the wrong one. - Yeah, I saw one vault. Figured that'd be the one. - [Jimmy] Above the bank vault you're in is another bank vault. But you didn't pick that one. You picked the easy one and
now you're trapped with Nolan. Is that a sledgehammer? (sledgehammer thudding)
(audio whistling) This thing's double steel reinforced, it doesn't matter. (sledgehammer thudding) - I really did fall for it, pretty bad at this one, didn't I? - [Nolan] Yeah. - Chris, see that hook right there? I need to attach it there. I'm gonna attach this one here. And we'll get you outta
here in just a second. Get comfortable, we might
move a little bit, okay? - You say get comfortable. - Hold on to something. (wall cracking)
(Chris grunts) - There's some activity going on right outside of the door here. - Well, one, I might
actually win the challenge. The only thing standing between that safe and the road is this brick wall. - Are you telling me to rob a bank? - Yeah, actually I am. - [Chris] And (indistinct). - Why is this thing moving. - [Jimmy] Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God. (upbeat rock music) (Nolan grunting) - What is happening? - You didn't tell me about this part. - I can't believe that worked. If you're gonna rob a bank, why don't you just do it like this? Nolan, has the assassin
attacked at you yet? - Well, I'm talking to you, Jimmy, so no. - Darn. Now we're gonna drive you
10 miles down the road. - I can't take this. - Yeah, we're not going on the highway, are we? - You have one hour left to win this hundred thousand dollars. I'll make your transportation quick. All right, get 'em outta here. (vault crashing) - Did we get lifted up
into the air at some point? (triumphant music) - [Jimmy] Oh, and as promised. (bank explodes) (upbeat music) Literally, everything has
gone according to my plan. I crushed his car,
bamboozled him at the hotel, escaped in a Lamborghini and a helicopter, and now he's trapped in a safe with Nolan. There is less than 40 minutes
left in the challenge. So we're heading to one last location, because keeping him in a bank vault kind of feels like we're cheating. For our last location, we built a carnival, but all
of this is a very expensive and elaborate distraction while I'm gonna try to
fake a serious injury and see if he still stabs me. I'm gonna give him one last chance. This time, face to face. The truck is now here with the safe. I'm gonna go over there
and break my ankle. All right. (ladder thuds)
(siren blaring) I've never broken a film before. We ended the production and
had the camera crew leave. The only cameras that kept rolling were hidden spy cameras from far away. There's 20 minutes left in the challenge. Let's see if he still stabs
me even though I'm hurt. I think you should let him out, Tareq. Guy, get ready. Get ready. (door creaking) - Guys, Jimmy got hurt. - [Assassin] Really? - [Tareq] Literally, get out. Jimmy got hurt. - [Jimmy] No, it just hurts. (person speaking indistinctly) - [Assassin] What happened? - My foot. - He fell off the ladder.
- Right, so where (indistinct) - Finished wrapping up-
- Got all this for a broken ankle, huh? - Yeah. (suspenseful music)
(knife clinks) - Yeah, I don't know about that. (suspenseful music)
(heart beating) - So, was it that obvious? - Whoo! Let's go!
(triumphant music) You don't splint a broken ankle. - That is true. I should have broke my leg. I was hoping I'd get away with
it for at least a little bit. Here's your a hundred thousand dollars. - This means a lot to me and my family. Thank you.
- Well, now I'm glad you stabbed me. That was a weird sentence. Thank you guys for watching. - Subscribe or I'm gonna hunt you down. ♪ Mr. Beast goes ♪ (bank explodes) - Jimmy is it over? - Jimmy

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJ2ifmkGGus,"1,000 Blind People See For The First Time",481,20230128,en,"- In this video, we're curing 1,000 people's blindness. (crowd cheering) It's gonna be crazy. - [Narrator 1] Most of us
see the world like this. But here's the thing, 200 million people see
the world like this. - [Mr. Beast] But I just made it one less. - Oh. Wow. - [Narrator 1] She is just one of 1000 blind people we helped from around the world. - They can't see. But we have all the technology to fix it. - Yep, half of all the
blindness in the world is people who need a 10-minute surgery. - Crazy.
- Yeah. - Oh my God. I see everybody. - Oh, I can see clearer. (laughs) I can jump for joy! (laughs) - Yeah, I can see your face, I can see your face, I can see your face. - [Mr. Beast] If you're wondering how the surgery allows
people to see again, it's because the lens in
their eyes is so cloudy that they can't see through it. So the surgeon uses a tiny vacuum to suck up the clouded lens. - Whoa, it's sucking. - [Mr. Beast] And replace
it with an artificial one. - [Narrator 2] The surgery is that simple. They can see again. - Woo... Oh my... - You pay for my surgery? - Yes. - Seriously? - You know what? Here's $10,000. To make your day even better.
(person in mask screaming) Is she okay? We're gonna go fix more people's eyesight. She's squeezing hard. - [Narrator 1] And we're
just getting started. We still have 980 lives left to change. - Sheesh! There's my watch. I've never seen it before. - Oh my God. - I have night blindness, I couldn't see. And you just deal with it for life. - I'm Nolan, by the way. - I'm Karl. - You're Karl? I know a guy named Karl. Not a good guy. - [Mr. Beast] Moment of truth. - Wow, you are pretty ain't you? (Mr. Beast chuckling) - What's it like? What do you see? - Blur. - How long have you not
been able to work for? - Four months? - Did you hear about
the cross eyed teacher? She couldn't control her pupils. - Ugh... - I'm gonna need an anesthetic soon. (dramatic upbeat music) - Oh man. No cloudiness, no blurriness. - Oh, it's perfect. - [Mr. Beast] Now what's it like? - I can see everything. - I don't need these. (laughs) - Our next patient is Charlie. You're not able to read
any of this text on the TV? - Nope, it's an E or something I think. - He won't know he won 10 grand until after his surgery. I can't wait to see his reaction. Charlie sees everything like this, and it's made him and his
family's life extremely difficult. - I was a cashier and my eyes was getting so bad, I couldn't see how much
money to give back. I just wanna get my vision back so I can go back to work. - Man, you're gonna be really
happy after this surgery. - We'll see after it. - Trust me, you will see. - [Mr. Beast] When
patients go into surgery, there's a chance that they
can get their life back. And for Charlie, if the surgery goes well, he can go back to work. What's it like? - Oh, wow. - All right, let's see
if he can read it now. What does this say? - You just won $10,000. - Here you go. - Oh my gosh. - Oh my gosh.
- Oh. - [Charlie] It feels good. I didn't think I was ever
gonna be able to see again. - Thank you all so much. - I don't wanna lose none of it. - I'll hold on to it. - Oh no, I'll hold on to it.
(everyone laughing) - Dr. Nolan. - He's not really a doctor. He's a fool. - Do you need any help? (medical staff laughing)
(upbeat music continues) - Wow. - And I just haven't been
me for the last 62 years. I can actually see your face. - That's crazy. - I can read this. (Mr. Beast laughing) - When you come out of the surgery, what's the first thing that
you are excited to see? - My son. He's been my rock through all of this. - Before the operation, you mentioned the first
thing you wanted to see was your son. - Seeing him, seeing his face. That's what I miss you know. - You're gonna make me cry. - No, no. You're good, man. You're good. You're really good, man. - [Mr. Beast] All right. - Oh my God, man. - There you go. - Hey, Dad. Don't cry. - I can see everybody's
facial features now. Just a little blurry
with my tears coming out. (everyone chuckling) - How's it going? - Okay. (chuckles) Yeah, I've been subscribed
to you for like 11 years. - Really? Oh my gosh. - Jeremiah has been blind in his right eye since he was born. And it's affected his
vision his entire life. Are you excited to be
able to see out of both? - Hopefully, if the surgery goes that way. - [Narrator 1] Because Jeremiah
was born with cataracts, his right eye has never received light. Which means this surgery only
has a 50% chance of working. - I think we go ahead and get it underway, and then we'll just talk post-op. - [Narrator 1] And while
Jeremiah's surgery was underway, I met another young man named, Satchel. - Did they tell you I was gonna be here? - No.
- Good. He had poor vision from birth, and almost lost his entire vision after a go-karting accident. - All I see is like blur and color. I can barely see the shapes. - Obviously, you can't drive, right? - No, I cannot. - And this is the real
reason why we're doing this. Blindness can take away
parts of your life. - And you know, I wanna drive. Since I can't drive, I'm just at home. - Good luck. We'll see you after the procedure. He mentioned multiple times, he really wants to drive after this procedure fixes his eyesight. So I'll see you at the end of the video when we surprise him
with a brand new Tesla. - [Narrator 1] But first, let's see if Jeremiah's
surgery was successful. - Let's do this. How'd it go? - Good.
- Yeah? Are you excited? - (laughs) Yeah.
(gentle uplifting music) - Take your time. No pressure. - Everything looks so more clear. - Yeah? To make this day even more special, since you're about to graduate high school and go to college, we wanted to give you $50,000
to put towards college. (gentle uplifting music continues) - I didn't even think this was real. Like I'm waiting to wake up. Oh my god. - [Narrator 2] And now, let's check in to see how
Satchel's surgery went. - Now I don't even see any blur. It's kind of great. - How are you feeling? How's life been now? - It's been good, you know. I'll be like looking at the cars and I'm like, ""Wow, I can see that car ""all the way over there."" - That's good. If you're gonna drive. - Yeah.
(everyone laughing) - I have a surprise for you. Do you mind putting on this blindfold? - Hold on, hold on. - I know it's a little ironic that we just did the surgery. Satchel, take off your blindfold. (car horn beeping) - What?
(upbeat music) - This is your brand new Tesla. - Woo! - And if Chris wrecks it, I'll buy another one. - Oh! (chuckles) Literally, I cannot put into words how I feel right now. - Have you ever driven a car before? - No.
(upbeat music continues) - I love how we're letting a guy who couldn't see a couple
weeks ago drive us. - Yeah.
- Wait. There's one cone you should hit. - Don't hit the cone. (upbeat music continues) - Yeah!
(everyone applauding) (car horn beeping) - So not only are we helping
people here in America but we're also going to other
places around the world. - [Narrator 1] Because unfortunately, nearly half the population
with curable blindness doesn't have access to this surgery. - [Narrator 2] So I wanted to provide this for as many people as possible. (uplifting orchestral music) - You see how many? - Two. - I can see! - As a thank you because you were just so
gracious in this video, we wanna make a $100,000 donation. - It'll bring sight to
thousands of people. (speaking in foreign language) - I see everything. - Oh my god, you are so beautiful. (Nolan laughing) Wow! - Thank you, Mr. Beast. - Thank you. - [Everyone] Thank you! (uplifting orchestral music fades)"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IKab3HcfFk,I Survived 50 Hours In Antarctica,730,20221224,en,"- We just landed in Antarctica, and we're gonna survive
the next 50 hours here. We're literally at the
bottom of the globe, at the coldest place on Earth.
(bell dings) - Can't wait to freeze to death. (plane engine hums)
- And there goes the plane. Right, all right, see you later. And now that that plane has left, boys, there's no way out for the next 50 hours. - We're stuck. - [Jimmy] First, we need to
trek towards the mountains, to get some protection from the wind. - This is the most beautiful
place I've ever seen. - Shut up, Nolan.
(laughter) - There's already a blizzard incoming. Just our luck. - The weather is so bad already. - This is so bad!
- Holy crap. - What are the odds that
a blizzard would happen right when we get here? - It's cold! - Jimmy, bro, this is insane. - Let's go! - We'll set up shelter at
the bottom of that mountain. Woo, I almost died. - [All] Antarctica! Antarctica! Antarctica! - I declare this Camp Beast.
(all cheering) - [Jimmy] It's negative 30 degrees, and if we're gonna survive 49 more hours- - Grab it! Grab it! - My tent about flew away. - [Jimmy] We need a shelter ASAP. The tutorial said to go at an angle. Oh! - I don't know, like,
we've got it all wrong. How's it so low to the ground? It's in my sleeve! (screams) - They're like little children. - We're screwed. - Whoa, they're actually making progress. - Look at us, we're the best! - Beast Camp is thriving! (stakes pounding)
(drums pounding) A common problem in Antarctica is extreme weather blowing away your tent. We gotta cut snow blocks to
secure the tents from wind. So we're gonna use these ice blocks to build a wall and keep our camp safe. It's literally dropped 20
degrees since we got here. We need to build the wall faster. (dramatic music) - (grunts) Holy cow. Dude, this is by far the
hardest thing we've ever done. - Beast Camp is now finished!
(cheering) Now that the ice wall is finished, hopefully, the wind won't
blow away our tents. The hard part about Antarctica
is the sun never goes down. So you don't know when it's night or not. - My tummy tells me when it is. - What time does your tummy say it is? - Dinner time. - Welcome home, honey. - Whoa, it's red in here. - And for dinner, we have MREs. - Woo! - Jimmy, this is awful. Welcome to Antarctica. - [Jimmy] And in case you're wondering how you eat in the most
remote place on the planet. First, you boil water, then you pour the boiling hot water, you gotta be careful, in here. And then in 10 minutes, you have food. And that's how you eat in Antarctica. - Oh, you don't know how good that tastes. (wind howls) - [Dream] I am so ready to sleep. - In my tent is Nolan and Dream. And Karl, who's in yours? - [Karl] It's me, Chandler,
Sapnap, and George. - You're going to bed, right? - [Karl] Yeah. - I am so tired, I'm sick. Antarctica, not a good
place to get sick in. - Jimmy has no idea
We're digging a tunnel. - Oh my God.
- Let's go. - It's just so crazy how he's so far down. - [Dream] Jimmy, I don't think
I'm gonna make it 50 hours. - The wind is picking up, so we're gonna have a hard time sleeping. All right, guys, well, bro fist out. - [Jimmy] The sun
literally never goes down in Antarctica, so night one was rough. - It's the next morning, and I don't know if I'm supposed
to get outta bed or not. 'Cause the sun's just always up. - Morning one, this is miserable. - Bro, Antarctica is not a funin' place. (George laughs)
I'm sick, man. I woke up coughing up blood. - Before you can leave
your tent in Antarctica, you need long pants, a long-sleeved shirt, a second pair of pants (grunts), a third pair of pants, a jacket, a jacket for your jacket, a ski mask, whatever this is, gloves,
gloves for your gloves, gloves and goggles so your
eyeballs don't freeze. And despite having all this
on, I can still get frostbite. Going into day two, there's two very important
things we need to take care of. Number one: In Antarctica, you would
think you could just pee in the snow, but you can't. So we have to pee in these bottles and hold onto it until
the end of the video. It's negative 20 degrees. Let's see if I can pee. Hey, I got it! - He did it! - I got it.
(party fanfare) - Nice. - Woo, that took like five minutes. And number two: A lot of the boys have to poop, so we're going away from
camp to set up a poop tent. - I gotta poop. - The worst part of Antarctica is that giant blizzards would
randomly sweep through, and your skin would
literally start freezing. - Oh no, the tent!
(all yell) (dramatic choral music)
- Oh, ow, it hurts! - (slapping) Bad tent, bad. - Hold it down! - Stay down, tent. - Oh, it worked. This bucket is my toilet,
and that's the bathroom. I'm gonna come out a better man. - Nolan, how is it? - That was the worst
experience in my life. - See that mountain right there? - [All] Yes! - It currently does not have a name. And everyone knows that
if you climb a mountain, you gidda name it. Who wants to join me? - Not me. - I'll just grab my stuff
out of the tent really quick. - Okay. - I left something in my tent. - The weather's kind of bad.
- Come on. - I might just have to... - Hey, you're climbing
the mountain with me. - Just cause I'm the last one here? - I need someone to be
hooked up to in case I fall. - Well, I'm glad it's not windy. - Seriously, since that
mountain isn't named, if we climb it, we
literally get to name it whatever we want. - Bye, guys!
- Bye. - Bye, bye.
- Now, Operation Hole. Come on.
(George laughs) (Karl sighs) - For the past 20-something hours, we've been digging this hole. By the time Jimmy's back,
this is gonna be massive! (""massive"" echoes through mountains) - We're not even at the mountain, and we faced our first obstacle. It's a sea of ice. Look at this view. Antarctica's crazy. Dude, beautiful. - Just be very careful, Jimmy. - Woo, this is very slippery. - Very careful. Less than 10 people on earth
have ever stepped here. - That's the mountain
we're gonna be climbing. Anyways, let's climb before we die. - Onward! - Oh, my gosh. - Whoa, oh, don't slip. - Oh, this is wild. I'm so terrified. There's a drop to my right. If I fall backwards, I roll for 2000 feet. (Jimmy grunts)
- Jimmy. - What? - We're 30 hours in! - Oh, yes! - This is a huge cliff. No joke, no joking. - [Jimmy] If we fall down there, we die. - [Nolan] Yeah, hundred percent. - Karl's still digging
though it's so deep. - Bro, how am I gonna get out? (intense music) - Jimmy! - I'm right here. Just keep stepping. - Woo, yes, I'm alive. - I'm gonna take a pee break. - Spell ""I cup."" - I C-U-P.
(Nolan giggles) - I hate you.
- Hey, Jimmy? (Jimmy exhales)
- Hey, just don't mix up the water bottles. - Oh yeah. See those tiny little specks over there? That's our base camp. I wonder what the boys are up to. - Here comes the airplane, mmm. - Ah-um. - Yummy.
- Yum! - The hole provides, and now
he must provide for the hole. - While Jimmy's climbing the mountain, we could have built up more
walls to fortify our camp. We could have cleaned up their tents. We coulda cooked them meals
for them to get home to. But instead, we dug this hole. This is the best use of our time possible. - [Jimmy] Stop filming me and
film that view over there. It feels like we're on a different planet. You can't convince me this is Earth. And while we climb this mountain, I wanna tell you guys about Shopify. A platform that makes starting
a business incredibly easy. Shopify helped me provide
YouTube channel into a business. And they can do it for whatever
you're passionate about. Like climbing mountains. Woo. If you've ever bought
my merch or feastables, you've used it. Oh, let's see, how do I do this? I'm forever grateful for them because I've been using 'em since we had 3 million subscribers. Shopify literally powers businesses. Oh, God, um. All right, gimme a second Shopify. Woo, we're climbing! Shopify powers businesses
in 175 countries. Starting a business can be scary. Kinda like climbing this mountain. - Yeah. - But entrepreneurship
allows you to wake up every single day and do what you love. So the risk is worth it. We're almost to the top. I can see it! - This is the most terrifying
experience of my life. - This is actually terrifying, we're so high right now. - Can you build an
elevator next time, Jimmy? (music swells) Right here, you got it? I made it. (triumphant music)
I made it! It only took four and a half hours. We did it! We did it. Nolan. Yeah, woo! We made it, and we didn't die. We've claimed the mountain. (music crescendos) We did it! And now that we climbed the
mountain, we gidda name it. I think we should name it ""Shopify."" Because, to be honest, I couldn't have done it without Shopify. - We just conquered Shopify. - Go to shopify.com/behindbeast to watch my exclusive
interview with Shopify. This is now Shopify Mountain. Karl, can you hear me? - Yes, I can hear you, over. - We climbed the mountain. - [Karl] Congratulations, dude! - Could you see us on top of the mountain? - One second, we have to
get outside of the hole. - Wait, what hole? - No, I said the whole tent. The entire tent. - [Jimmy] Uh, okay. - They literally look like
three little ants up there. - Our base camp is over 10 miles away. If that lens could see us, that's crazy. You know the best part
about climbing a mountain? - What?
- You have to climb down. - No, no. - Also, you can't leave things behind, so I gotta take this flag down. - I carried it up all the way for that? What do you think they're
doing at camp right now? - Not something intelligent. (George growls) - Best snow day ever! - These sleeping bags are complicated. What is this? (both laugh) (Karl imitates a seal) - Dude, I gotta go to whiz. - Okay, guys, it's four in the morning, and Jimmy's finally arriving back after climbing the mountain. - This might have been the
hardest thing I've ever done. - The hardest, but most rewarding thing. - He has no idea we dug this hole, so we're gonna get in and surprise him. - Home sweet home, ah! - I need a massage. Ow, Jimmy. (buzzing sound)
I'm not a bed. Where is everybody? - Nolan.
- Dream. - Dream!
- Oh, my god! How long were you gone for? - Something's not normal. I don't hear Karl going
""bleh, bleh, bleh!"" Karl? They're probably asleep
'cause it's 4:00 AM. Karl? Wait, what, is everyone up? - Jimmy's out there, you can see him. (George coughs) - What is down here? Oh, my god! Whoa, wait, how deep is that hole? - It's like eight feet deep. - I'm confused. - What's so confusing? It's just a hole. - Yeah, but why? - We're just trying to, you
know, make use of our time. - I'm too tired to understand this. - Get in the hole! - [All] Yeah! Hole, hole, hole.
- How? How did they do this? - [All] Hole, hole, hole, hole! - I wanna get in the hole. - This is actually a convenient hole. Can you grab my iPad? - Yeah. - Do you know what's on this iPad? - Penguin videos. (Nolan laughs)
- No. Our next two Mr. Beast videos. - [All] Oh. - I'll let you guys choose. Do you guys wanna watch ""Blind
Man Sees for the First Time?"" Or ""I Ate the World's Largest Burger?"" - Blind Man Sees for the First Time. - I wanna see the blind man, actually. - Okay.
- There you go. There's a little iPad.
(iPad beeping) - Tell me what you think. Is that crazy? - Yeah, what? - That was awesome.
- That was so cool. - Oh, my god, it is cold here. It's so cold that the screen
on the camera just went black. - This is actually freezing outside. - I don't wanna be here anymore. I'm gonna head to bed. - This the camera tent. We're saying good night. Good night, everybody. - Climbing a mountain
really took it out of me. And we got back at four in the morning. It was nearly impossible to
get out of bed on day three. - It's the last day. You guys ready? Jim?
- What? - We have to pack up
before the plane leaves. Otherwise, we're stuck here. Look, if we miss this flight, Jimmy, we're here for like another day. - [Jimmy] I'll put pants on in a minute. - Jimmy, get up! - Or is this your first survival video? - Yes. - They haven't got out
of the tent, Derrick. We are going to miss the flight. Actually, let me rephrase that. They're gonna miss the flight. I'm still making it. - We're making the flight, baby. - [Jimmy] It is extremely important to preserve the untouched
beauty of Antarctica. We can't leave a single
trace of our camp behind. So I made the boys put
everything back how it was. ""Leave nothing behind"" on three. Three. - [All] Leave nothing behind. - But they were as exhausted as I was, so things didn't get done quickly. - I've got absolutely zero energy left. All right, now put that in it. Put it on-
(slapping sound) (small explosion) - No! - There she is, out in the open. No, no, no, no, stop, no. (rapid thumping)
Stop! - Salute. - A sad day for all Antarcticans. - Hole.
- Fill it in now. - All right, get to filling, boys. Three, two, goodbye hole. - Goodbye, hole.
(snow thumping) - There's a hole in my heart, instead. (rising music) - And boom! We can now head home! - [All] Yes, home, home, home, home! - Hey, if we maintain this pace, we'll get to the ice strip
right before the plane lands. - [All] Plane, plane, plane, plane. - Hey, Antarctica trip. - [All] Antarctica! Antarctica! - Right over here is the runway. - Yes.
- All right, I see the plane. (all cheer)
(George laughs) I'm proud of all of you for surviving 50 hours in Antarctica!
(all cheer) We're going home, and we survived! - We did it! - Massive shout out to ALE and EYOS. They made this trip possible. I hope you guys enjoyed. - We're going home! (cheering)
- [All] Home, home, home! (explosion)
