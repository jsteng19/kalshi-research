Prime Minister Netanyahu, met with Mossad Director Yossi Cohen and thanked him for acceding to his request to lead the joint procurement command center, ahead of its transfer to the Health Ministry on Tuesday. Prime Minister Netanyahu commended the achievements of the joint procurement command center led by the Mossad, which oversaw the massive acquisition of medical equipment and vital protective gear as part of the fight against the corona epidemic. The professional teams are currently overseeing an orderly transfer in order to maintain the activity as necessary. Prime Minister Netanyahu: "First of all, I would like to thank you. Yossi, I assigned you, along with the Defense Ministry, to deal with procurement and acquisition. You did this exceptionally well; the results speak for themselves. We are currently passing the torch. We do not know what the day will bring. We do not know what the month will bring. Having acquired the experience, remember it since we might need it again. Thank you very much, on behalf of myself and the citizens of Israel, for the excellent work." Mossad Director Cohen: "Prime Minister, this Tuesday we will hold a ceremony to mark the orderly transfer of the entire matter, from A to Z, from the current heads of the command center to the Health Ministry. We have been involved in this campaign for over two-and-a-half months. We prepared – at your request – to assist the State of Israel regarding all matters of procurement and acquisition, and beyond that in all the limits that you are familiar with. On Tuesday, we will hand over management of the command center and this whole matter to the trusted hands of the Health Ministry."
