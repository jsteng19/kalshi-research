This is a breakthrough. This is a digital revolution that will further reduce the gaps, increase equality and cancel the meaning of geographic distance. Thanks to it, many patients will be able to avoid the necessity of going to hospitals for tests, pupils from around the country will benefit from distance education, etc."

Regarding the presentation by Communications Minister Moshe Kahlon and senior officials in his ministry, Prime Minister Netanyahu said, "What Minister Kahlon and his people have presented today is a genuine revolution in the communications field. This is a revolution based on far-reaching reforms and breaking up cartels and monopolies in order to benefit competition. In the end, competition is for the benefit of the consumer. This revolution is already finding expression in reductions of thousands of shekels in the expenditures of every home in Israel."
