Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu yesterday evening met with European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini and expressed his disagreement with the EU's intention to label products from settlements. He said that for many Israelis this recalls dark days in Europe and added that it hardens Israeli domestic opinion.

The two also discussed today's Quartet meeting.

Regarding the resumption of the negotiations, Prime Minister Netanyahu reiterated that he is prepared to negotiate without preconditions and said that the fact that Abu Mazen has not responded proves that the latter does not intend to reach a peace agreement.
