Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening, at the Kirya in Tel Aviv, met with Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides.

Prime Minister Netanyahu, at the start of the meeting:

"Nikos, my friend, you are coming at a time which I can say is our darkest hour.

It is a battle of civilization against barbarism. What we saw in Gaza, along our communities is beyond description. It is savagery that is the worst that we've seen against Jewish people since the Holocaust. They murdered children in front of their parents and parents in front of their children, burned people alive, decapitated people, raped and murdered women. Babies who were hiding in the attic, they killed them. Today we discovered a grandmother in a secret attic holding her grandchild. They murdered both of them.

This is savagery on a scale that is unimaginable. And our battle against Hamas is the battle of civilization against barbarism.

Hamas, I said in the UN ten years ago, almost a decade ago, Hamas is ISIS. People didn’t believe me. Now they know it's actually worse than ISIS, as President Biden said, and Chancellor Scholz said that Hamas are the new Nazis.

The world united to fight the Nazis. The civilized world united to fight ISIS. And now, the civilized world should stand with us as we defeat ISIS. This is our goal.

Thank you for your strong support from the start."

Also attending the meeting were:

For the Israeli side – the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Strategic Affairs Minister, the Director of the National Security Council, the Prime Minister's Chief of Staff, the Prime Minister's Military Secretary, the Prime Minister's Diplomatic Adviser and the Head of the National Public Diplomacy Directorate

For the Cypriot side – the Foreign Minister and the Cypriot Ambassador to Israel, among others.
