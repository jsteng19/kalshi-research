Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening received the report of the committee – chaired by Energy and Water Resources Ministry Director-General Shaul Tzemach – that evaluated natural gas policy.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said: "Gas is an energy source that gives Israel a new economic horizon. It could give us both economic strength and economic independence. I think that it is important that we develop it wisely and responsibly. I intend to study the report and submit decisions that will give us future prosperity."

The Prime Minister also said: "What the State of Israel needs now is a responsible budget. I remind you that in the face of global unrest, we succeeded in lowering the unemployment rate. Today it stands at 7.2%; it was higher. Today, it is higher in the US and in Europe. There it is 11% and there are countries in which 50% of young people are unemployed. I am not prepared for that to happen here. So that it does not happen here, the State of Israel needs a responsible budget."
