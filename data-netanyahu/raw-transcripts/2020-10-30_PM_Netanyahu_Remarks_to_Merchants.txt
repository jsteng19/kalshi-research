Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"To all of my friends, the merchants, I know how difficult it is. I request that you cooperate for another few days. We have promised to open next Sunday (8 November), maybe earlier if morbidity goes down, and this is the main problem. Morbidity is leaping forward around the world. With joint forces we succeeded in lowering it. We do not want it go up again and then we would need to re-impose the restrictions. I will help you in every way. We have helped you economically; we will help you with even more measures. Hold on, in a few more days you will be able to open and with G-d's help we will overcome the morbidity together and together the coronavirus as well. We will help you to rehabilitate your businesses. You are important to me, I hear you, I understand you."
