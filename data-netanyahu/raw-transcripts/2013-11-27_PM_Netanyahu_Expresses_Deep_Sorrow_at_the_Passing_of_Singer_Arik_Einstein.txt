Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expresses his deep sorrow over the passing of singer Arik Einstein. "Arik was the greatest of them all. We all grew up on his songs. If you said 'Arik Einstein', you said the Land of Israel. Arik was an exemplary singer and an exemplary human being. The songs that he composed and sang are the soundtrack of the State of Israel. I loved him very much. With great sorrow, the State of Israel takes leave of a cultural giant who will be greatly missed. My wife and I are very pained by his passing," the Prime Minister said.
