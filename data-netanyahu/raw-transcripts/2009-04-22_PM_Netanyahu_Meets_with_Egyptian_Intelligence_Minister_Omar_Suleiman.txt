Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today met with Egyptian Intelligence Minister Omar Suleiman, who – on behalf of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak – invited him to visit Egypt. Both sides are examining the possibility that the Prime Minister might visit Egypt in the coming weeks. Minister Suleiman is the most senior Egyptian official to have visited Israel in recent months.

The meeting between the two lasted nearly two hours and covered a wide range of issues on the agenda, including bilateral relations, the diplomatic process, the struggle against terrorism, the situation in the Gaza Strip and Gilad Shalit. Mossad Director Meir Dagan and National Security Council Director Uzi Arad attended most of it; otherwise, it was private, between Prime Minister Netanyahu and Minister Suleiman only.
