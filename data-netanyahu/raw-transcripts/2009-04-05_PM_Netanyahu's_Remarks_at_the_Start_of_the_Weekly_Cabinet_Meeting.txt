Following are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahuâ€™s remarks at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting:

"At the start of the new Government's first Cabinet meeting, I want to emphasize three things that will guide us: Unity, responsibility and work.

This Government is a genuine unity Government. It was created out of a sense of deep responsibility concerning the need to deal with the urgent security, economic and social challenges that Israel faces. And so with that, we set to work.

Today, the Government will approve a decision to quickly pass a bi-annual budget in order to cope with the economic crisis.

Today, we will establish a diplomatic-security cabinet, and in the coming weeks we will complete the formulation of our policy to advance peace and security.

Today, we will provide first-aid to needy families for Passover. I will work with Social Welfare and Social Services Minister Isaac Herzog and Finance Minister Yuval Steinitz in order to resolve the problem of nutritional security. In the coming days, I will appoint someone to head the health system so that there will be a clear address to lead that important establishment.

Today, we are abrogating the previous Government's decision regarding the Prime Minister's Residence. We will analyze this issue anew and we will present another, more modest proposal.

The ministers and I have a heavy responsibility and before us there is much work. We will act together to ensure the future of the country. Today we will roll up our sleeves and get to work."
