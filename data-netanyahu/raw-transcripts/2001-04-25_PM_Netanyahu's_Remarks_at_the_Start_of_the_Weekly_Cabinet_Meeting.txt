Following are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s remarks at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting today:

"This morning, I met again with Senator Mitchell. Israel wants to begin the peace process immediately. The US wants to start the peace process immediately. I can only hope that the Palestinians will want to start the peace process immediately. In the coming days, we will know if the peace process gets underway. I hope that it will.

The talks with the US and its representative

were very positive.

Today, on behalf of both myself and the Government, I would like to greet our Druze brothers on their holiday, the holiday of Nebi Shueib, the prophet Jethro.

The Druze community

is a splendid example of the integration of a minority in a democratic state, in every field – government, the military, industry and culture. I think that there is much that needs to be done to strengthen and advance the community and the Government will do it.

Today, we will advance a plan to save the State of Israel's coastline. This is a scenic and environmental asset of the highest order, which is unique to our country. There are many things on the escarpment along the shoreline, including many buildings. If we do not take care of this receding escarpment, we are liable to see developments that will cost human lives, as has occurred elsewhere in the world. Therefore, this plan is necessary for reasons having to do with both safety and environmental protection. For both these reasons, we will establish a team to submit recommendations to the Government within 120 days. This expresses the Government's commitment to the environment. We did this last week in order to protect the Sea of Galilee basin; we are doing so today to defend our coastal escarpment. I think you will see how green a Government this is."
