Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today met with

South Sudan

President Salva Kiir Mayardit and told him that the story of South Sudan is an inspiration and teaches how it is possible to establish a new independent state in an area that has been – and is yet – embroiled in painful conflict.

"South Sudan was established after long negotiations and with the agreement of all parties involved and the international community.

Israel was among the first countries to recognize South Sudan

, less than 24 hours after it was declared, and will be pleased to contribute knowledge and experience to it in a variety of fields that can help the new country. I hope that everyone will see that this is the way to establish a state – through direct negotiations and not via unilateral measures," Prime Minister Netanyahu said.
