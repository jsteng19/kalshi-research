Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has instructed the Israeli delegation to act as they did last year and not be present during the Iranian President's remarks.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said that despite the charm offensive by the new Iranian president, the policies of the regime toward Israel have not changed.

Just last week, Rouhani, like Ahmadinejad before him, refused to recognize the Holocaust as an historical fact.

When Iran's leaders stop denying the Holocaust of the Jewish people, and stop calling for the destruction of the Jewish state and recognize Israel's right to exist, the Israeli delegation will attend their addresses at the General Assembly.
