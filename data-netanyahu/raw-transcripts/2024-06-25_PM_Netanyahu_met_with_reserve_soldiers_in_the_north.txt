"I have come here, first of all, to tell you that I greatly appreciate your service. We are trying to give expression to this and it seems we will need to give this additional expression; assistance to you and your families for the amazing service you have been doing since the beginning of the war.

On behalf of all citizens of the State of Israel, I would like to tell you that you are marvelous. I also want to tell you that I rely on you and the people of Israel rely on you.

Somebody here told me: 'Because we are the people of Israel.' This is what I want to tell you here and nobody in the world is better than you. We are helping – and we will help even more because you deserve it and we must achieve our objectives, which are – victory. We will achieve it with G-d's help and with yours."
