Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, last night (Thursday), in New York, met with Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof, thanked him for the Netherlands' support of Israel and noted the good relations between the two countries. The Prime Minister also emphasized that Israel's war against Iran's axis of evil is vital not only in ensuring its future but also the future of the West as a whole.

Prime Minister Netanyahu reviewed the threats facing Israel, the fighting in the various sectors and its efforts and success in minimizing harm to non-combatants.

The Prime Minister referred to the proceeding against Israel in the International Court in The Hague and emphasized that this is a political proceeding based on false libels that endanger every democracy defending itself against terrorism.

For the Israeli side – Prime Minister's Office Director General Yossi Shelley, Israeli Ambassador to the UN Danny Danon, National Security Council Deputy Director Yossi Draznin, the Prime Minister's Foreign Policy Adviser Dr. Ophir Falk and the Prime Minister's Spokesperson, Dr. Omer Dostri.
