Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made the following remarks today, at a meeting of the ministerial team on the development of Eilat:

"The problem of infiltrators is now being dealt with. The fence will be finished in a few months. We will stop the flood of infiltrators. This week we passed in the Knesset a law to step up punishment of those employers who bring illegal infiltrators. We are now building holding facilities near the fence so that we will be able to move the infiltrators directly to detention for up to three years. We have also started actions to repatriate the illegal infiltrators to their countries of origin. We will solve the problem.‚Äù
