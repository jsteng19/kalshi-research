Following are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks at the start of the Cabinet meeting today on the state budget:

"The story of the Israeli economy's success in the last decade stems from the fact that we took control of expenditures and enacted reforms and took other steps in order to increase both revenue and competitiveness. We must continue this tradition.

We also have needs such as – inter alia – education and social needs. We also know that we are in a threatening environment and must respond accordingly.

We tried to achieve a comprehensive solution by the new fiscal rule, which leads to a certain restraint that is, to a certain degree, less than what is customary in other advanced economies. The reason for this is mainly that the sum of their sins in the past decade is greater than ours.

Our formula allows us a certain space, but not beyond what the formula says. We have no possibility of deviating from the budgetary parameters we have set. We must stick close to it, and today we will make a decision according to the budgetary framework that we set according to the new fiscal law. There is one thing that we must do: Decide to move the system forward."
