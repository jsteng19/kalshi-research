Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, at the Western Wall, lit the eighth candle of Chanukah.

"In recent days, I have heard that the Palestinians are saying that the Western Wall is occupied territory. I want to tell them from the closet possible place to the miracle of the jar of oil: The Western Wall has been ours for 3,000 years, and it and the State of Israel will be ours forever," the Prime Minister said.
