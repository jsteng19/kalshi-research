Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening, has called for calm at the demonstration being held in Jerusalem. "I strongly condemn the beating of the Ethiopian IDF soldier and those responsible will be held accountable. However, no one is allowed to take the law into their own hands. The immigrants from Ethiopia and their families are dear to us and the State of Israel is taking many steps to ease their integration into society. We will continue to do so in the next government as well," the Prime Minister said.
