Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, met with children from the Valley of Springs Regional Council ahead of Shavuot. The children brought the Prime Minister a basket of locally grown first fruits.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said, "I thank you for the basket of first fruits and I wish you and all Israelis a happy Shavuot. The first fruits are a symbol of growth, development and renewal; may all our efforts bear fruit."

The first fruits were from a new, educational section of a 70-year old experimental farm in the Valley of Springs Regional Council area that was developed in order to preserve local children's and residents' links to the soil and the achievements of both the experimental farm and local farmers.
