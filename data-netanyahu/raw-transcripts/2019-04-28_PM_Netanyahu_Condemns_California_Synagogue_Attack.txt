Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this morning, issued the following statement: "I condemn the abhorrent attack on a synagogue in California; this is an attack on the heart of the Jewish people. We send condolences to the family of Lori Gilbert-Kaye and our best wishes for a quick recovery to the wounded. The international community must step up the struggle against antisemitism." In light of the upsurge in antisemitic attacks around the world, Prime Minister Netanyahu will, this week, convene a special discussion of all elements dealing with the issue.
