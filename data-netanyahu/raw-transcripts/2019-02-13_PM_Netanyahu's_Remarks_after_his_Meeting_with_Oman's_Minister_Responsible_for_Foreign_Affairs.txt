Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in Warsaw, after his meeting with the Sultanate of Oman's Minister Responsible for Foreign Affairs, Yusuf bin Alawi, made the following remarks:

"I have just come from an excellent meeting with Oman's Minister Responsible for Foreign Affairs. We discussed additional steps we can take together with the countries of the region in order to advance common interests. This will continue.

From here I am going to a meeting with 60 foreign ministers and envoys of countries from around the world against Iran. What is important about this meeting – and this meeting is not in secret, because there are many of those – is that this is an open meeting with representatives of leading Arab countries, that are sitting down together with Israel in order to advance the common interest of combatting Iran."

Prime Minister Netanyahu added:

"What we are doing is pushing and driving Iran from Syria. We are committed to doing this.

It is cold in Warsaw right now but Israel's foreign relations are warming up, warming up for the better."
