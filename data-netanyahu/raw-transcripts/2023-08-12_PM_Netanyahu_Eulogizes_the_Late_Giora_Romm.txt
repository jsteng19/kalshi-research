Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening: "Together with many Israeli citizens, I share the sorrow of the family of Maj.-Gen. (ret.) Giora Romm, who contributed greatly to the state, first in his service as an Air Force pilot and later in various public roles. I invite you to be impressed by Giora's personality and by his way, and to read his autobiography about his life as a pilot who was taken captive by the Egyptians â€“ and returned to flying. Two weeks ago, when his severe illness became known, I spoke with Giora. This was an emotional conversation in which Giora, as was his way, showed a steadfast spirit."
