Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today: "This morning, the air force attacked significant Iranian Quds Force targets, and Syrian military targets, in Syria. This is the clear policy that I have been leading for years. We will not allow Iranian military entrenchment against us in Syria and we will not tolerate any attempt to attack us from Syrian territory. Whoever tries to attack us or attacks us â€“ will bear the consequences."
