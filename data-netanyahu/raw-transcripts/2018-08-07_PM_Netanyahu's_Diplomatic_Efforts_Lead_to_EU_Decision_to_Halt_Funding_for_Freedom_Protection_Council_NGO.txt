Pursuant to the diplomatic efforts of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the European Union has announced that it will immediately stop funding and contact with the "Freedom Protection Council", an NGO operating in Israel, which undermines the State of Israel's right to exist and seeks to defame it around the world.

"This is only the beginning. We will continue to take determined action against organizations that seek to delegitimize the State of Israel and strive to defame the state and the IDF around the world."
