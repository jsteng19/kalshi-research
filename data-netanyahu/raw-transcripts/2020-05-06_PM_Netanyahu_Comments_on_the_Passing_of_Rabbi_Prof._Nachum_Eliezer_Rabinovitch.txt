Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today:

"I lament the passing of the head of Yeshivat Birkat Moshe in Maaleh Adumim, Rabbi Prof. Nachum Eliezer Rabinovitch. On behalf of myself and the citizens of Israel, I would like to send sincere condolences to his family and to his many students.

Rabbi Rabinovitch was an erudite person â€“ a great and learned rabbi, a prominent arbiter of Jewish law, with an education in the sciences. Maimonides served as his example of a Jewish sage who combined Torah and wisdom.

Love of the Land of Israel led Rabbi Rabinovitch to the Birkat Moshe hesder yeshiva in Maaleh Adumim, where he cultivated students of Torah who serve in the IDF.

His spiritual leadership was characterized by loyalty to Jewish law combined with cultural sensitivity. The issue of conversion was close to his heart and he sought to bring close those who were distant.

May his memory be blessed."
