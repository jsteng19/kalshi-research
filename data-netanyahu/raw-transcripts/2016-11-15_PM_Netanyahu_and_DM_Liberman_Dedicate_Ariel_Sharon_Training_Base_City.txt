Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman dedicated the IDF Ariel Sharon Training Base City.

Prime Minister Netanyahu and Defense Minister Liberman visited the IDF School of Military Medicine, where they were briefed by school commander Col. Moshe Meyouhas. On display were technological innovations and applications being developed by soldiers in order to make learning and the medical services given to IDF personnel more efficient.

Prime Minister Netanyahu observed an exercise and a simulated multiple casualty event, and the general activities of the soldiers. Afterwards he and Defense Minister Liberman met and spoke with paramedic's course cadets.

Prime Minister Netanyahu, in response to a soldier's question:

"We are in close contact with Russia. I have met with Putin four times in the past year in order to enhance ties and so that there will not be a confrontation between the IDF and the Russian military that nobody wants; as of now there haven't been any and we hope that there will not be. The reality in the Middle East is changing very rapidly and not necessarily to our detriment. The most important thing is that must be very strong. Everybody flees from the weak. We are very strong and you strengthen us."

Prime Minister Netanyahu told the cadets, "I am very impressed by what I have seen. This is exceptional. May you succeed now, as you continue your service and afterwards. And come to the Negev; this is a good place."

Acting National Security Advisor and Head of the National Security Council Brig.-Gen. (ret.) Jacob Nagel and Prime Minister's Office Director General Eli Groner also accompanied the visit.
