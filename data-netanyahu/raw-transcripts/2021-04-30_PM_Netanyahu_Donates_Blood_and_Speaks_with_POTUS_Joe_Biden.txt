Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, yesterday afternoon, went to Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem in order to donate blood as part of the national blood drive in wake of the Mt. Meron disaster. US President Joe Biden telephoned the Prime Minister yesterday afternoon and expressed condolences over the Mt. Meron disaster. Prime Minister Netanyahu: "Like many citizens of Israel, I have come to donate blood as an act of solidarity with the injured and with the terrible tragedy that occurred here. At critical times, our people come together and this is also what we are doing now. I will do everything, as will the Government of Israel, to help the families of the victims. We know your deep sorrow. We know that your world has collapsed. We will help you to recover however we can. I just spoke with President Biden. He called me and sought to express his condolences and his sorrow over the tragedy that occurred here. I thank him on your behalf, citizens of Israel, as I do President Putin, Indian President Narendra Modi, the leaders of Europe and leaders from the Arab world â€“ from Bahrain, the UAE and many other leaders who share in our grief and that of the citizens of Israel. At these moments, we are together than ever." Alongside the Prime Minister, Shaare Zedek Medical Center Director General Prof. Ofer Merin also donated blood.
