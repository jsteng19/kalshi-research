Following the publication of Pope Benedict XVI's new book, in which he exonerates the Jews from being responsible for Jesus's death, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today sent the following letter of appreciation to the Pontiff:

"I commend you for forcefully rejecting, in your recent book, a false charge that has been a foundation for the hatred of the Jewish People for many centuries. My fervent hope is that your clarity and courage will strengthen the relations between Jews and Christians throughout the world and help promote peace and reconciliation for generations to come. I look forward to seeing you again soon and to expressing my deep appreciation for you in person."
