Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the passing of the former Chief Sephardic Rabbi Eliyahu Bakshi-Doron:

"I am deeply grieved, along with the entire Jewish people, over the passing of former Chief Sephardic Rabbi Eliyahu Bakshi-Doron. My deepest and sincerest condolences go to his honored family and to his many students.

Rabbi Bakshi-Doron was an important link in the Torah chain of Sephardic rabbis. His exceptional knowledge of Jewish sources was intermingled with his noble qualities. He was endowed with a pleasant disposition and received everyone warmly.

Rabbi Bakshi-Doron was a teacher for all Jewish communities in Israel and around the world. I met him many times and was always struck by his warm personality. For him the Torah was a guide for life. His essence was understanding, tolerance and love for the people and the state.

To our sorrow, Rabbi Bakshi-Doron was infected with the coronavirus and despite their efforts, the doctors were unable to save him. We mourn his loss. His memory will continue to be etched in the hearts of our people."
