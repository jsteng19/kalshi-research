Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today commented as follows on the decision of the Palestinian Authority to accede to various international treaties:

“It is the Palestinian Authority – which is in a unity government with Hamas, an avowed terrorist organization that, like ISIS, perpetrates war crimes – that needs to be concerned about the International Criminal Court in the Hague.

We will take steps in response and we will defend the soldiers of the IDF, the most moral army in the world.

We will rebuff this additional attempt to force diktat on us just like we rebuffed

the Palestinian appeal to the UN Security Council
