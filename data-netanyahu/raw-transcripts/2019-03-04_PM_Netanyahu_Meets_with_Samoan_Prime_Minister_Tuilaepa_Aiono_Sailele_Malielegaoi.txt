Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this morning, at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem, met with Samoan Prime Minister Tuilaepa Aiono Sailele Malielegaoi. An agreement was signed regarding visa exemptions for incoming tourists.

The two prime ministers discussed strengthening bilateral relations. Prime Minister Netanyahu said that he expects that the tightening of relations will find expression in Samoan support for Israel in international forums.

Prime Minister Netanyahu at the start of the meeting:

"Prime Minister Tuilaepa this is your first visit to Israel and I'm sure it won't be the last because there's an abiding friendship between Samoa and Israel and we greet you here as a friend.

We're going to sign an agreement to remove visa requirements for Israelis and Samoans. We appreciate your friendship. We appreciate your support in international forums and your support for Israel joining the Asian Development Bank. Equally we are cooperating in many areas in agriculture, IT, health and energy and we are prepared to do a lot more.

You are being welcomed as a friend. I know that you've had time to visit some of the sites here. I hope you take some more time. You'll see an ancient land with deep roots in our history, yet with a striving to seize the future for the betterment of our people and all mankind. In that sense we welcome you as part of our common civilization. Welcome friend, to Jerusalem."
