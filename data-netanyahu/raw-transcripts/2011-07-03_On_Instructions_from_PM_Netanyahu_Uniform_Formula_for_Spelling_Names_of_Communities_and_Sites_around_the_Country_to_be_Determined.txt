The Cabinet today appointed a ministerial committee to approve a uniform formula for spelling the names of communities, interchanges, junctions and historic sites around the country. The uniform formula will appear – inter alia – on maps and road signs, in textbooks and guidebooks, and in all other official publications. This is in order to bring about a uniform written standard and make it easier to read maps and signs.

The new spelling rules will apply to copying from Hebrew to Latin letters, from Hebrew to Arabic and from Arabic to Latin letters, and vice-versa. The new rules will be determined in accordance with the official map index that was formulated by the Government Names Committee, and which was designed to create uniform spelling rules that have not been changed since 1957, and were research-oriented in character.

Upon the approval of the names by the ministerial committee, all bodies and authorities in the State of Israel will be required to adopt them.

Minister Zeev Binyamin Begin will chair the committee. Its other members will be: Home Front Defense Minister Matan Vilnai, Science and Technology Minister Daniel Hershkowitz, Justice Minister Yaakov Neeman, Interior Minister Eli Yishai, Transportation Minister Yisrael Katz, Tourism Minister Stas Misezhnikov, Culture and Sports Minister Limor Livnat, Public Diplomacy and Diaspora Affairs Minister Yuli Edelstein and Public Service Improvement Minister Michael Eitan.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcomed the decision and said that the phenomenon in which the names of communities and sites were spelled in a variety of ways, "required a fundamental change of approach."
