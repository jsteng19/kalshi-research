Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, spoke with Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov and thanked him for the thorough and professional investigation into the 18 July 2012 terrorist bombing in Burgas.

Prime Minister Netanyahu told Bulgarian Prime Minister Borissov, "The findings of the investigation are clear and prove that Hezbollah was responsible for the atrocity in Burgas.

This is an additional indication that Iran, through its proxies, is conducting a global terrorist campaign that crosses borders and continents.

I hope that the Europeans will draw the necessary conclusions regarding the true character of Hezbollah after this criminal attack on European soil against an EU member state."
