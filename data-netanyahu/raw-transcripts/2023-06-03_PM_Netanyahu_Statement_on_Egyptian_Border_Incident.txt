Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening: "The deadly incident on the Egyptian border on Shabbat is severe and extraordinary and will be fully investigated. I want to commend our forces who sought contact and eliminated the terrorist. Together with the entire people of Israel, I share in the sorrow of the families of Staff Sgt. Ohad Dahan and Sgt. Lia Ben-Nun, and the third soldier whose name has yet to be released, and wish a swift recovery to the wounded. Our hearts are with the families in their profound grief."
