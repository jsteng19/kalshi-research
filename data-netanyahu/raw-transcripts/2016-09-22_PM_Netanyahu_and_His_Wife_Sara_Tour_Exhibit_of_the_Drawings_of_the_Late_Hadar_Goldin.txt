Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara, today at the United Nations in New York, toured the art exhibit of the drawings of the late Hadar Goldin, along with the latter's parents, Simcha and Leah, and brother, Tzur.

The unique exhibit, entitled "The Final Peace", is currently being held at the UN as world leaders arrive for the General Assembly. The exhibit was initiated by the Israeli mission to the UN.

Earlier today, Prime Minister Netanyahu noted in his remarks to the General Assembly:

"That's the same Hamas terror organization that cruelly, unbelievably cruelly refuses to return three of our citizens and the bodies of our fallen soldiers, Oron Shaul and Hadar Goldin. Hadar Goldin's parents, Leah and Simcha Goldin, are here with us today. They have one request – to bury their beloved son in Israel. All they ask for is one simple thing – to be able to visit the grave of their fallen son Hadar in Israel. Hamas refuses. They couldn't care less."
