Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, made the following remarks at the start of security consultations at the Defense Ministry in Tel Aviv:

"At present there is no need to change daily routines. Despite the low assessment regarding Israel's involvement in what is going on in Syria, we decided to deploy Iron Dome batteries as well as our other intercept systems. We are not involved in the civil war in Syria. But I would like to reiterate, if anyone one tries to harm Israel's citizens, the IDF will respond very strongly."
