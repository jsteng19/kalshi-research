Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, on the passing of Rabbi Yeshayahu Heber:

"I would like to express deep sorrow over the passing of Rabbi Yeshayahu Heber, founder and chairman of Matnat Chaim, which assists people who need kidney transplants. Rabbi Haber himself underwent a kidney transplant and instilled in the general public the awareness of donating. At the same time he worked to link donors and recipients and oversaw the entire process. Thanks to him, hundreds of people in Israel have received new lives. Rabbi Heber was an exemplar of humanity, lovingkindness and mutual guarantee. We all hoped that he would recover from the coronavirus but to our anguish he passed away this evening."
