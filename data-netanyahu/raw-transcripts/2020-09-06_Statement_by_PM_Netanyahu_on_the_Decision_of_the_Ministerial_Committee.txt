Prime Minister Netanyahu: "Citizens of Israel, I would like to update you on the decision that the ministerial committee made this evening.

In the last 24 hours, another 10 cities have been added to the list of red cities and we have already reached 40 red cities. In light of this, the professional elements have recommended that night curfews be imposed on these cities and that their education systems be closed, in addition to the restrictions on gatherings. I know that these restrictions are not easy but in the current situation there is no avoiding them. Even though mortality in Israel is still among the lowest in the world, with all the sorrow over every loss of life, and the number of severe cases is still stable, strength is not forever [see Proverbs 27:24]. The professional elements are warning that given the high morbidity situation in Israel, the trend is liable to reverse itself at any moment with a dangerous addition of severe cases and deaths and the danger that the teams of doctors treating corona in the hospitals could collapse.

In light of these data and recommendations, this evening's decision was considered, responsible and required by reality. We will continue to take the responsible steps necessary in order to safeguard health, lives and the economy. I promise to continue updating you. Thank you."
