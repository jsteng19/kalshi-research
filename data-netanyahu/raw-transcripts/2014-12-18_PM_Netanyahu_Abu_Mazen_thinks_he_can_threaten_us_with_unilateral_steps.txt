Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem, lit Chanukah candles with PMO employees and made the following remarks:

"Abu Mazen thinks he can threaten us with unilateral steps. He does not understand that they will result in a Hamas takeover in Judea and Samaria, just as previously occurred in Gaza. We will not allow this to happen. We will never agree to unilateral diktat. We will always safeguard our security. This is our lesson both from the days of the Maccabees and in our day."
