Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made the following remarks about events in Libya:

"Today we were informed of the tragic murder of the American Ambassador in Libya and the murder of three consulate workers in the American consulate in Benghazi. The people of Israel grieve with the American people; we send our condolences to the families. If there's any people in the world that understands what Americans are going through, what they went through in 9/11, it's the people of Israel, who've been standing at the forefront of the battle against terrorism, who've lost loved ones and who deeply, deeply sympathize with the people of America at this time."
