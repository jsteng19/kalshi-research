Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in his Jerusalem office, hosted a group of special needs children who are currently celebrating their bar and bat mitzvahs with the assistance of the Lend a Hand to a Special Child association.

Osher, a representative of the children, thanked the Prime Minister for the warm welcome and told him that for the children, their bar and bat mitzvahs were not ordinary events but special days that symbolized the transition to adulthood and the acceptance of religious observance. She added that they were very moved by the fact that the Prime Minister was with them to mark the occasion.

Prime Minister Netanyahu gave each child a Book of Psalms and invited them to visit the Cabinet room and become ministers for a day. He congratulated the children and said, "I would like to wish you all a joyous bar and bat mitzvah. I hope that you will always be happy."
