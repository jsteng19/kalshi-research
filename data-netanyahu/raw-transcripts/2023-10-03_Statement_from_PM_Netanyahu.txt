Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today: "Israel is fully committed to safeguarding the sacred right of freedom of worship and pilgrimage to the holy sites of all faiths. I strongly condemn any attempt to inflict harm on worshippers, and we will take urgent steps against such actions. Offensive behavior toward worshippers is a desecration and is unacceptable. We will show zero tolerance toward any harm to worshippers."
