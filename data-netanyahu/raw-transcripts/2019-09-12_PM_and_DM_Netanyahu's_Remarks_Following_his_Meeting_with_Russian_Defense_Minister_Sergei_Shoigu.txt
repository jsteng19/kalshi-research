Prime Minister and Defense Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in Sochi, after his meeting with Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, made the following remarks: "I have just finished an important meeting with Russian Defense Minister Shoigu, and I am going to a no less important meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The first issue is security, and this is maintaining freedom of action for the IDF, including the air force, in the face of Iran's attempts to militarily entrench in our region against us. We are operating constantly and it is important to prevent unnecessary collisions. This is what we are doing in meetings such as these and also, of course, in the many telephone conversations between them. Beyond this I must say that there is a natural connection because there is a human bridge between Israel and Russian-speaking countries. We have over one million emigres from the former Soviet Union in the country and their contribution is considerable. But I want you to know that their contribution is also in making this connection, which is so important for the security of Israel."
