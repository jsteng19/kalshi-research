Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued the following statement today :

"There can be no discrimination against Israeli Arabs. We must not generalize about an entire public due to a small and violent minority. The vast majority of Israel's Arab citizens are law-abiding and whoever breaks the law â€“ we will take determined and vigorous action against him. In the framework of the draft nationality law that I will submit to the Cabinet on Sunday, we will enshrine the full equality before the law of every citizen regardless of religion, race or sex alongside ensuring Israel's identity as the national state of the Jewish People; there is no contradiction between the two and I will not allow these two basic principles to be undermined."
