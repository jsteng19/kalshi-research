Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, visited the wounded at the Edith Wolfson Medical Center in Holon. Prime Minister Netanyahu: "I have come here to Wolfson hospital to visit Orin, a little girl whose wound could have been mortal but thanks to the marvelous work of the people at the site and of the doctors here â€“ she has been saved. Next to her a boy from Gaza is being cared for. This shows you the difference between civilized people and the forces of darkness. I said yesterday that these forces of darkness, Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists, would pay a heavy price. A short while ago, we targeted senior Hamas general staff commanders including the Gaza City Brigade commander and others. This was only the beginning. We will inflict blows on them that they have never dreamed of."
