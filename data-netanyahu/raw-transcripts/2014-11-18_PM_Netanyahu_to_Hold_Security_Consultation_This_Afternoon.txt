Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will, this afternoon , at his Jerusalem office, hold a security consultation. "This is the direct result of the incitement being led by Hamas and Abu Mazen, incitement which the international community is irresponsibly ignoring. We will respond with a heavy hand to the brutal murder of Jews who came to pray and were met by reprehensible murderers," the Prime Minister said.
