Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem, welcome the President of the Republic of Chad, Idriss Deby.

Prime Minister Netanyahu and Chad President Deby will hold a private meeting and will then issue statements to the media. They will meet again over dinner.

This is an historic visit, the first by a President of Chad to Israel since the establishment of the state. The visit comes against the background of the manifold diplomatic efforts led by Prime Minister Netanyahu in recent years. (Relations between the two countries were severed in 1972.)

"This is an additional diplomatic breakthrough. This is an historic and important visit that comes against the background of the efforts we have led. I welcome the President of Chad on his arrival in Israel."
