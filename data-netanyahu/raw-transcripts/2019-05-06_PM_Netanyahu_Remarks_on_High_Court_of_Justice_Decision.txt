Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, made the following remarks: "The High Court of Justice is wrong and disappointing. There is no place for a memorial ceremony comparing the blood of our people and that of terrorists. This is why I refused to allow the ceremony participants to enter and I believe the High Court should not have intervened in my decision."
