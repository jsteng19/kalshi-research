Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem, chaired the first meeting of the Ministerial Committee on the Fight against the Cost of Living. Prime Minister Netanyahu at the start of the meeting [translated from Hebrew]: "Today we are holding the first meeting of the Ministerial Committee on the Fight against the Cost of Living. This meeting will be dedicated – first of all – to presenting the problem. Prices in Israel are significantly higher than they are on similar or identical products in most developed countries. There is no objective justification for these gaps. There are geological layers here of open and hidden monopolies and all kinds of impediments to competition. Additionally, I have gained the impression recently that the importers, manufacturers and distributors have simply lost their restraints. We are meeting here, and we will meet from time to time, because we are going to evaluate this and we are going to fight it. This has not been decreed by fate. Israel does not need to be more expensive than most developed countries. Together with my government colleagues and the professional teams, we will wage a determined battle against the cost of living. I have asked to hold the next meeting in two weeks at which time I will ask the professional echelons to submit practical steps for this fight. We will meet regularly every few weeks, with a working plan. We will go ministry by ministry in order to lower the cost of living for you, citizens of Israel."
