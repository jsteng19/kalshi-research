Following is an excerpt from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks at a National Defense College graduation ceremony, on Mt. Scopus in Jerusalem, this evening:

"Peace is made only between the strong. In the Middle East and in the brutal world in which we live, in order to survive, you have to be strong. This was true in Herzl's time and is true seven-fold in our time. We will not entrust our national security to others. Israel will always defend itself by itself against any threat, near or far. Maintaining, preparing, developing and operating this ability as necessary â€“ this is our national security. I am certain that each one of you will contribute to it in your own way."
