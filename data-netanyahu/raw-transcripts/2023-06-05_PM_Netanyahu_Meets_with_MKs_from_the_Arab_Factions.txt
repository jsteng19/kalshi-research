Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening, met with MKs from the Hadash and Ta'al factions in order to discuss operative solutions to stem the wave of murders in the Arab sector. It was agreed to establish a steering committee for the Arab sector, which will also include dealing with crime, that will integrate all government branches that deal with the Arab sector; the Prime Minister will chair the committee. Prime Minister Netanyahu: "The State of Israel cannot accept terrorism. The murderous criminal organizations that are terrorizing the Arab sector are not defined as terrorist organizations but – in practice – they are imposing fear on the entire population. We need to put politics aside, remove the barriers and work together to defeat this reprehensible plague."
