Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York City, met with UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres. Prime Minister Netanyahu emphasized the role of Iran in undermining stability in the Middle East and the entire world. He expressed the hope that the international efforts led by the US for normalization with Saudi Arabia would bear fruit soon, and expressed his confidence that the initiative for an economic corridor between India, the Gulf states and Israel to Europe would contribute to strengthening the global economy. Prime Minister Netanyahu also demanded that the UN Secretary General change the attitude of the organizationâ€™s institutions toward the State of Israel and said that it was untenable that while major changes for the better were taking place in the entire world and in the Middle East, that the UN was unaffected and remained steadfast in its hostility to Israel. The Prime Minister added that the time has come for the UN to condemn Iranian subversion and Palestinian terrorism against innocent civilians, and to refrain from its baseless criticism of Israel.
