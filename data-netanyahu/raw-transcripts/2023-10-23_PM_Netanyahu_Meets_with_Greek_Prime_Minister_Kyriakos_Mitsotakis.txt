"Prime Minister, my good friend, Kyriakos, it's very good to see you here.I always say that the best thing about standing with Israel is standing in Israel in Israel. And you're doing that. I appreciate the solidarity of you, your government, the people of Greece, at this darkest hour.

It's a battle against civilization. It's civilization against barbarism. We're on the side of civilization. We have to unite, all together, against Hamas, which is ISIS."
