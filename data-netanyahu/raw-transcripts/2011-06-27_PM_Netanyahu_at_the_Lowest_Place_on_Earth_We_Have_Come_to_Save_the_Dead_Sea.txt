Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today toured the southern Dead Sea region in order to study first-hand the flooding problem that threatens the hotels and infrastructures in the area. The tour was in continuation of discussions he has held in recent weeks regarding the proposed alternatives for a long-term solution.

Prime Minister Netanyahu instructed a team, to be chaired by Finance Ministry Budget Director Udi Nisan and Accountant General Michal Abadi, to consider alternatives for financing the preferred solution (full harvesting), within 21 days. The Prime Minister expressed the hope that within a few weeks, it would be possible to begin work to save this global natural resource.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said that, "The Government has come to save the Dead Sea and it is also obligated to save its tourism industry and scenic beauty as well. Previous governments talked about this but my Government is doing something. We will try to reach a solution through dialogue with the Dead Sea Works, but if not, we will act with all the means – including legal – at our disposal."

In recent years, the Dead Sea hotels area has been in danger of flooding due to a rise in the water level of the Dead Sea Works pool #5. As part of the process of extracting phosphates from the pool, its level has risen by approximately 20cm per annum, due to the sinking of the groundsalt.

Prime Minister Netanyahu was presented with three alternative solutions: Harvesting the salt that has accumulated at the bottom of the pool, creating a unique lagoon for the hotels and relocating the hotels to a higher area.

Tourism Minister Stas Misezhnikov, Environmental Protection Minister Gilad Erdan, Finance Minister Yuval Steinitz, Interior Minister Eli Yishai and Justice Minister Yaakov Neeman also participated in the tour.
