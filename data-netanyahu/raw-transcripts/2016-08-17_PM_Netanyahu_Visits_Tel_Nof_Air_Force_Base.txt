Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accompanied by IDF Deputy Chief-of-Staff Maj.-Gen. Yair Golan and GOC Air Force Maj.-Gen. Amir Eshel, visited the Tel Nof air force base.

Prime Minister Netanyahu first met with Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman and later received a security briefing from Maj.-Gen. Eshel on the challenges facing the air force. The Prime Minister toured an exhibition that included F-16's, Boeing 707's, Gulfstream-5's, Apache attack helicopters, Sikorsky CH-53 heavy transport helicopters, remote-controlled UAVs and an Iron Dome battery.

At the conclusion of the tour, Prime Minister Netanyahu said:

"I visited the air force today along with the Defense Minister and GOC Air Force. I met senior air force commanders who command the best pilots, ground crews, air defense crews and anti-missile crews we have. I saw here outstanding people and breath-taking developments.

There is no air force better than ours. When I send it to carry out its missions, it goes anywhere, anytime, on any mission and this is true even as we speak.

I think that the citizens of Israel need to know that they have who to rely on. I salute the air force and I salute the State of Israel that has these soldiers, commanders, men and women, who safeguard the security of the country. Thank you GOC Air Force, thank you all."
