Following is an excerpt from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks, today, at Mt. Herzl in Jerusalem, at the state memorial ceremony for Ze'ev Jabotinsky [translated from Hebrew]:

"Only increasing the military pressure on Hamas will lead to achieving all of the objectives of the war, including the return home of all of our hostages, the living and the deceased.

Iran and its minions are looking to surround us in a stranglehold of terrorism. We are determined to stand against them on every front and in every arena â€“ near and far. Whoever seeks to harm us will pay a very heavy price."
