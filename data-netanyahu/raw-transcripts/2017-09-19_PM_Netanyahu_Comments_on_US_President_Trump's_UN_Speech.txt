Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, commented on US President Donald Trump's speech to the UN General Assembly:

"In over 30 years in my experience with the UN, I never heard a bolder or more courageous speech. President Trump spoke the truth about the great dangers facing our world and issued a powerful call to confront them in order to ensure the future of humanity."
