Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today (Tuesday), 12.10.10, held a discussion on the draft planning and construction law in order to move it forward during the Knesset's winter session, which began yesterday.

Deputy Finance Minister Yitzhak Cohen, Knesset Interior Committee Chairman MK David Azoulay, coalition chairman MK Danny Danon, MK Zeev Elkin and Prime Minister's Office Director-General Eyal Gabai attended the discussion.

MK Azoulay announced that he would hold intensive discussions of Knesset Interior and Economics Committees' joint committee, which he chairs and which was established to advance the draft law. It was also agreed that Deputy Minister Cohen would coordinate Government-Knesset action on the issue, assisted by an inter-ministerial team of experts.

At Prime Minister Netanyahu's request, additional amendments and improvements were added to the draft law in order to ensure professional, reliable and transparent processes by all the main elements involved in the planning and building process. Click here for further details.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said that, "We will continue to advance the legislation on reforming the planning and construction process in order to finally alleviate the bureaucratic impediments that delay increasing the supply of land for construction and which provide constant incentives for corruption and the use of undue influence. Reforming the planning and construction process, along with reforms in the Israel Land Administration and in transportation, will add 1-2% per annum, over a decade, to our GNP. This means that we will have resources for important national needs, especially for security and education."
