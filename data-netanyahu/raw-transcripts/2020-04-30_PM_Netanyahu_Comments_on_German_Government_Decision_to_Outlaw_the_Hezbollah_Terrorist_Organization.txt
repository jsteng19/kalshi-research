Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today: "I welcome the decision of the German government to outlaw the Hezbollah terrorist organization. Germany is thus joining countries such as the US, Britain, Canada, Australia and countries in Latin America, that have already taken this step. All peace-loving countries need to condemn the terrorist organizations and not give them any direct or indirect assistance."
