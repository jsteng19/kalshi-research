Prime Minister Netanyahu, at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem, held economic discussions: Prime Minister Netanyahu after the discussions: "Today, I held a series of economic discussions with the Finance Minister, the Economy and Industry Minister, the Governor of the Bank of Israel and others in order to ensure the resilience of the economy. The Israeli economy is in an excellent situation. We are entering the Corona crisis and our situation is better than most countries around the world. We have taken steps, such as establishing a NIS 4 billion fund to help businesses that have been hurt by the Corona. At this time we are working to add additional money. Regarding supplies, most supplies to the State of Israel come by sea â€“ products, raw materials, all these things, including food. Almost all food comes by sea so there is no reason to storm the supermarkets. There is more than enough food and there will be more than enough food. Regarding supplies by air, we are taking all steps and measures at our disposal to ensure that here too there will be an orderly supply by air to Israel. I would like to wish all citizens of Israel a happy Purim, with lots of hamantaschen." Participating in the discussions were the Finance Minister, the Economy and Industry Minister, the Tourism Minister, the Governor of the Bank of Israel, the head of the National Security Council, the head of the National Economic Council, the Acting Director General of the Prime Minister's Office, the Director General of the Finance Ministry, the Director General of the Health Ministry, the President of the Manufacturer's Association, the Director General of the Tax Authority, the head of the Finance Ministry Budget Division and other officials.
