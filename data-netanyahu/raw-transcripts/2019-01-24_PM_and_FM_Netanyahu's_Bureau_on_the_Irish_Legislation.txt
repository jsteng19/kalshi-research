Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's bureau, this evening, on the Irish legislation:

The Irish Ambassador will be summoned tomorrow (Friday, 25 January 2019), to the Foreign Ministry for a reprimand.

Israel is outraged over the legislation against it in the Dail which is indicative of hypocrisy and anti-Semitism.

Instead of Ireland condemning Syria for slaughtering hundreds of thousands of civilians, Turkey for the occupation of northern Cyprus and the terrorist organizations for murdering thousands of Israelis, it attacks Israel, the only democracy in the Middle East. What a disgrace.
