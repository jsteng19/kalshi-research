Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara, together with Transportation Minister Miri Regev and Culture and Sports Minister Yechiel Tropper, today, at Mt. Herzl in Jerusalem, met with the torchlighters for the State of Israel's 73rd Independence Day.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"The stories are moving, you are moving, each and every one of you. This is not mere lip service. This allows the heart to beat strongly, with great faith as I listen to you.

A few days ago we marked Holocaust Martyrs' and Heroes' Remembrance Day. Eighty years ago, what were we? We weren't. Dust. That is how we were regarded â€“ they turned us into dust. There was no one to protect us and we cried out. Nothing and nothing. Now, 80 years later, we are but 1/1,000th of humanity, not even one percent, 1/1,000th. We are ranked by 20,000 opinion-makers in 20 countries, every year, as the eighth-ranked power in the world.

I would like to tell you that our struggles are over but they are not. Usually, the enemies are only replaced. What has changed is our ability to defend ourselves and create a magnificent life here. This is thanks to you. You saw it now with the coronavirus. This is thanks to the people, thanks to the mobilization. In different aspects of our society, with the challenges that are yet before us, we see this everywhere. These currents, connections and strengths are what give us the unique strength to do things that are a wonder to all humanity.

You are our wonder and I salute each and every one of you."

Fourteen torchlighters, who shared their stories, participated in the meeting: Dr. Dror Diker, Tzipi Harfens, Maj. Maor Cohen, Shira Iskov, Adi Gozi, Shlomi Shabat, Abie Moses, Rabbi Eitan Shenrav, Eden Tapet Habetinesh, Ofri Butbul, Yaish Giat, Nurgis Abu Yaman, Maher Ibrahim and Gabriela Shtrigler.
