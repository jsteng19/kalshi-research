PM Netanyahu, at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem, met with Italian Vice Prime Minister and Minister of Internal Affairs Matteo Salvini and said at the start of the meeting:

"Netanyahu: I want to welcome Mr. Salvini here. He has been a great friend of Israel. You had the opportunity to see the terror tunnels yourself directly. This is a clear act of aggression of Hezbollah against us and against the norms of the international community. You have a commander in UNIFIL, an Italian commander. We think UNIFIL has to do a stronger job, tougher job, but ultimately it's the responsibility of the international community. They should stop Hezbollah from taking these acts of aggression against Israel."
