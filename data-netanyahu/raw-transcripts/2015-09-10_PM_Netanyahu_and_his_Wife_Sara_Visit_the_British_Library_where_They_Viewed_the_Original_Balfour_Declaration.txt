Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara visited the British Library in London where they were briefed on the library in general and two items in particular â€“ the original Balfour Declaration, in which UK Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour declared that Britain would support the establishment of a national home for the Jewish People in the Land of Israel, and a book edited by the Prime Minister's father, the late Prof. Ben-Zion Netanyahu. The latter was a volume of Herzl's writings that the Prime Minister's father had edited in 1937 when he was only 27. The Prime Minister said that Herzl was a visionary and great leader and noted the link between him and the Balfour Declaration.

The Netanyahus also viewed a Passover haggadah, Tanakh, an edition of the Talmud (Tractate Bava Kama) and other volumes.
