Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu:

To all our dear Druze brothers — a joyous Nabi Shu'ayb Festival. The Druze community is important and dear to us, and an inseparable part of who we are.

Our Druze brothers, you are fighting heroically, shoulder to shoulder with all the fighters of the IDF. There's a unique union between us — a union of blood and a union of life.

In honor of the Festival, some 650 Druze religious elders crossed the border from Syria to Israel today and reunited with their family members in Israel for the first time since 1967. This is a testimony to the increasingly deep ties between us and our Druze brothers — and not only within Israel.

The government I lead has done a great deal to develop the Druze sector and invest in it. We have pledged to bridge the gaps and expand equal opportunity in the sector — and we are doing that.

Just recently in the Government we enacted a 5-year plan for the Druze community valued at 3.9 billion NIS. The plan will address the sector's needs in terms of real estate, culture and tradition, and increase the development budgets in local authorities across the sector.

Our dear Druze brothers, we will continue to invest, develop and deepen the brave ties between us.

Have a joyous Nabi Shu'ayb Festival!
