Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expresses his deep sorrow over the passing of Israel Defense Prize and Kaplan Prize laureate Tzvi Kamil, who had served for many years as the Chairman of the Commission on Nuclear Safety. He contributed his vast experience and expertise to the defense establishment. Kamil acted out of a sense of national mission; his activities with the Commission were on a voluntary basis. He also devoted much of his time to his interests in the electronics industry. May his memory be blessed.
