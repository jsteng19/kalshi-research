Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening: "Demonstrations are a sacred right in a democratic country but we will neither accept nor tolerate any kind of violence. Stabbing a policeman is crossing a red line; I send my best wishes for a quick recovery. I call on all citizens of Israel to respect the law and the men and women of the security services."
