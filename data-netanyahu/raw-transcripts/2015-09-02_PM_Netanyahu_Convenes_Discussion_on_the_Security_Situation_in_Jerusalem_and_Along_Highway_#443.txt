Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in his office, convened a discussion on the security situation in Jerusalem and along Highway #443. Also participating in the discussion were Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon, Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan, Intelligence and Transportation Minister Yisrael Katz, Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked, ISA Director Yoram Cohen and additional officials.

Prime Minister Netanyahu made it clear that he cannot accept a situation in which stones and firebombs are thrown along a main route to – and within – Jerusalem and said, "The policy is zero tolerance for stone-throwing and zero tolerance for terrorism."

The Prime Minister ordered that units along Highway #443 be reinforced, that intelligence and observation efforts be stepped up and that the possibility of adding cameras and lighting along the entire length of the highway be examined.

Two additional Border Police companies and approximately 400 Israel Police personnel will be stationed in Jerusalem.

Since the legal system is finding it difficult to deal with stone-throwing by minors, changing open-fire orders regarding the throwing of stones and firebombs will be examined, as will be the imposition – by law – of minimum sentences for those who throw stones and firebombs.

Prime Minister Netanyahu concluded the discussion by declaring that such incidents must be significantly reduced.
