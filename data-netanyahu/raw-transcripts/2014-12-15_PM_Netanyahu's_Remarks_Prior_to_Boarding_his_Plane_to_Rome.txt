Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this morning left for Rome where he will meet with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi and US Secretary of State John Kerry. Before boarding his plane, the Prime Minister made the following remarks:

"In recent years we have rebuffed recurrent attempts to dictate conditions to us that would have harmed Israel's security and which are incompatible with genuine peace. This time as we will we will not accept attempts to dictate to us unilateral moves on a limited timetable. In the reality in which Islamic terrorism is reaching out to all corners of the globe, we will rebuff any attempt that would put this terrorism inside our home, inside the State of Israel. I will make this unequivocally clear. We will stand firm in the face of any diktat."
