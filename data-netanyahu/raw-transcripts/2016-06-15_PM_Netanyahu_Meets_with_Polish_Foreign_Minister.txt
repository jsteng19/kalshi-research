Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met this afternoon with Polish Foreign Minister Witold Waszczykowski and told him at the start of the meeting, "We have a growing friendship and I look forward to the opportunity to discuss in concrete ways to make it even stronger."

The Prime Minister added

: "This is a worldwide problem, obviously, of rampant barbarism that attacks all of our societies. And I think the civilized nations must band together. I said this yesterday at

the meeting with the NATO ambassadors

, and I say it again to you. And I also say that we should not only cooperate on matters of fighting terror, but to cooperate in other matters – of technology, of trade. You have a robust economy. We have a robust economy. And I think the more we cooperate, the better it will be for both our peoples."

Polish Foreign Minister Waszczykowski said

: "We have a chance today to discuss the situation in our regions – in your region, in my region. Both our countries face difficult problems, conflicts and sub-conflicts around, but at the beginning let me convey to you condolences because again there was a terrorist attack in Tel Aviv. So please accept my condolences and please let me convey the condolence to the victims of the attack." He added: "There is a great opportunity, a great chance to develop a bilateral relationship, and you know, the Israeli technology can help us improve our situation, economic situation, and to develop our country further."
