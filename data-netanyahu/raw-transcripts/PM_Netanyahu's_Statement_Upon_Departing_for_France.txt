Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, upon departing for Paris France, made the following statement:

"We are departing to a very important ceremony to mark the centennial of the end of World War I, a bloody war, which claimed the lives of millions.

It was also very important to the history of our people. First of all, the fact that there were hundreds of thousands of Jewish fighters, which marked the next turning point in our ability to defend ourselves, and, of course it brought to an end the Ottoman Empire that ruled our land, and paved the way for Zionism.

I will meet dozens of leaders from around the world, and I will have a separate meeting with President Macron. There are many important issues that need to be discussed, but the very essence of being there is important. I, as usual, will represent the State of Israel with great pride."
