Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, made the following remarks at the start of the Cabinet meeting:

"I would like to express my appreciation to the IDF soldiers who foiled an attack in the north today. I would also like to send my best wishes for a quick and complete recovery to our wounded. We have proven that we respond strongly to any attempt to attack us be it in the south, the north or any other sector. We have also witnessed the threats that are gathering round us, threats that the entire world is aware of and some of which it is dealing with. These threats require us to invest considerable sums in security and in the communities close to the confrontation line. For this reason, I have asked that the tax benefits for these communities be extended; I have spoken about this with Finance Minister Yair Lapid and I think that the matter has been resolved.

I would like to wish all of you and all of Israel a Happy Sukkot. This is your opportunity to travel around the country on the highways, interchanges, bridges and rail lines that we are building in our country."
