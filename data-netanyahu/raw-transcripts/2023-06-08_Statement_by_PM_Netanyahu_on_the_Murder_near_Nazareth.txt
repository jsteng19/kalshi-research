Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this afternoon [translated from Hebrew]:

"I was shocked by the terrible murder near Nazareth. We are determined to stop this chain of murders.

We will do so not only by reinforcing the police but also with the aid of the ISA. I am determined to bring in the ISA to assist the Israel Police against these criminals and the crime organizations, and these murders.

Earlier this week, I held a series of meetings on this issue with security, legal and police officials and I intend to continue next week, and to achieve rapid results."
