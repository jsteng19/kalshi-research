Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Remarks in Eli

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today , at the Bnei David institutions in Eli :

"This is not 'another round', neither is it an exchange of blows, nor is it an operation â€“ it is total victory. Nothing less. I am committed to it. Our fighters are committed to it and the overwhelming majority of the people is committed to it. We will not compromise on anything less than total victory.

I hear talk about all kinds of deals. I would like to make it clear: We will not conclude this war without achieving all of its goals. This means eliminating Hamas, returning all of our hostages and ensuring that Gaza never again constitutes a threat to Israel.

We will not withdraw the IDF from the Gaza Strip and we will not release thousands of terrorists. None of this will happen. What will happen? Total victory!"
