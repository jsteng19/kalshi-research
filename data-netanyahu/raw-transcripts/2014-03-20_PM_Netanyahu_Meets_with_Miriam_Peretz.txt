Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this afternoon, met with Miriam Peretz on the occasion of her 60th birthday, and congratulated her on being chosen as one of the torchlighters for Israel's upcoming Independence Day, which this year will center on women. Miriam lost two of her sons, Uriel and Eliraz, who fell while serving in the IDF. She was accompanied today by her sons Avichai and Eliasaf.

Prime Minister Netanyahu thanked Miriam for her endless giving and help to others despite her daily pain and loss and told her: "You are teaching a lesson to our state and our people. In being a torchlighter you will hold the torch for all of us. This is your strength; you are the mother of the entire nation. Congratulations; you have succeeded in moving the entire country."

Miriam thanked Prime Minister Netanyahu and added: "This is the minimum that I can do. I would like to add that as I hold the torch, I will see you. I will see all the good people in this country that have allowed me to continue living here safely."

Miriam Peretz has been involved in education for decades. She is the mother of six children, two of whom fell while serving as officers in the IDF. Despite this, she has been involved in assisting bereaved families and IDF wounded. The public committee that chose her as one of the torchlighters determined that she, "serves as symbol of the heroism of the Jewish and Israeli spirit and is an example of giving and helping others. Despite the double disaster, she has mustered all her strength and is working to strengthen the spirits of bereaved families and IDF wounded, all out of love for the Land and People of Israel."
