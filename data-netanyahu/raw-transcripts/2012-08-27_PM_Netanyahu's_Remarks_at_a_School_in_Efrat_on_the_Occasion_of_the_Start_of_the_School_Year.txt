-Translation-"Thank you. I would like to tell my friends and colleagues, Education Minister Gideon Saar, Oded Revivo and MK Ze'ev Elkin, who lives in the area, and to tell everyone, that Efrat and Gush Etzion are an integral, fundamental and evident part of greater Jerusalem. They are the southern gate of Jerusalem and will always be part of the State of Israel.

We are building Efrat and Gush Etzion with energy, faith and responsibility; thus we are also building education in the State of Israel. Today I am here with Education Minister Saar because this is a newsworthy day. First of all, there are children here who are going up to first grade. Shalom, first grade. Stand up for a moment. Here, you are standing up. This is significant. You are standing on your feet and you are starting to go forward. You are learning to read and write – the alphabet, you are learning math, you are learning science and you are learning the Tanakh and Israel's heritage, everything is bound together.

Today, we are also marking a special day in the annals of the state. It is special because today we are starting something unprecedented in the state – free education from age 3. Once it was a matter of money, today it is free – true equal opportunity from age 3. This saves parents NIS 800 a month, NIS 8,000 a year, but it is mainly an opportunity to educate children from the roots to the top.

And I would like to wish you, children, the kindergarten children who come so open, so happy, to first grade; I wish that the first graders will pass primary school successfully and reach high school, and afterwards to university, and that you will achieve everything you dream of doing, everyone of you. You can do everything. [As Binyamin Ze'ev Herzl said] If you will it, it is no dream, and today, the state is offering its support. Therefore, arise and succeed. Shalom, first grade; shalom to everyone.

Thank you."
