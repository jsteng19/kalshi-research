Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, made the following statement in wake of Central Bureau of Statistics data to the effect that the unemployment rate declined to 6.7% in November:

"I welcome the continued decline in unemployment in Israel, which has been achieved thanks to responsible economic leadership in partnership with Finance Minister Dr. Yuval Steinitz and Bank of Israel Governor Prof. Stanley Fischer. In 2009, unemployment was higher in Israel than it was in Europe. Since then, unemployment in the Euro bloc has only risen whereas the unemployment rate in Israel has only declined. In this period, while the world was dealing with a global economic crisis, over 350,000 additional jobs were added to the Israeli economy. An additional item that should be noted is that the unemployment rate among young people also declined last month in continuation of a downward trend since 2009. Today, the unemployment rate among young people in Israel is significantly lower than in European countries and the US."
