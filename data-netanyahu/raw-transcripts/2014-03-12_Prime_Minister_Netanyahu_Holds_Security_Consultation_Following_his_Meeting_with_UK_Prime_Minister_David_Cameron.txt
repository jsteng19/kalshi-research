Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held a security consultation following his meeting with UK Prime Minister David Cameron. Participating in the telephone consultation were Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon, IDF Deputy Chief-of-Staff Maj.-Gen. Gadi Eisenkot and ISA Director Yoram Cohen. The Prime Minister directed all necessary action be taken in order to restore quiet in the south.

Earlier, at the start of his press conference with Prime Minister Cameron, Prime Minister Netanyahu said: "The IDF is responding forcefully to the firing against the citizens of Israel by the Islamic Jihad in the Gaza Strip. If there is no calm in the south, there will be no calm in Gaza, and that's putting it mildly. I call upon the residents of the south to follow the instructions. The IDF will do the job."
