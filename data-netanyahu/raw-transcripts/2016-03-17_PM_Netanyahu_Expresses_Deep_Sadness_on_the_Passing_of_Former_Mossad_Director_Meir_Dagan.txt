Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this morning issued the following statement on the passing of former Mossad Director Meir Dagan:

"I would like to express deep sadness on the passing of Maj.-Gen. (ret.) Meir Dagan. Meir was a daring fighter and commander who greatly contributed to the security of the state in Israel's wars, at the [National Security Council] Counter-Terrorism Bureau and as Director of the Mossad. The photograph in which his grandfather is being humiliated by Nazi soldiers shortly before he was murdered in the Holocaust was always before his eyes. Meir was determined to ensure that the Jewish People would never be helpless and defenseless again and to this end he dedicated his life to building up the strength of the State of Israel. In the eight years in which he served as Director of the Mossad, he led the organization to daring and pioneering operations. A great soldier has passed away; may his memory be blessed."
