Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today, in Tel Aviv, met with Chaim Aviel Beckman from Carmiel, who suffers from a rare blood disorder and needs a bone marrow transplant.

The meeting was held after Prime Minister Netanyahu joined the effort to help Aviel recover his Facebook page which had disappeared.

Via

the Facebook page

, Aviel succeeded in raising 10% of the cost of his treatment (NIS 350,000).

The Hebrew page

has over 25,000 friends, which Aviel's mother Nirit defined as their, "supportive virtual family." The Prime Minister told Aviel that he would like to meet him again soon when he is healthy.
