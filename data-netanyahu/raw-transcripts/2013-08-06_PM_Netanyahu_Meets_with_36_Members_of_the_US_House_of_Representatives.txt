Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, met with 36 members of the US House of Representatives led by Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer (D-MD).

Prime Minister Netanyahu said, "Iran's president said that pressure won't work. Not true! The only thing that has worked in the last two decades is pressure. And the only thing that will work now is increased pressure. I have said that before and I'll say it again, because that's important to understand. You relent on the pressure, they will go all the way. You should sustain the pressure."
