Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today , visited IDF Northern Command Headquarters where he received an operational briefing – by the head of Northern Command, Maj.-Gen. Ori Gordin – on the wide-ranging offensive and defensive activity in the sector.

The Prime Minister also spoke with Maj.-Gen. Gordin and the divisional commanders on the detailed operational plans in the sector and heard about the determination among the divisions to take such action as may be necessary to restore the residents of the north to their homes with security.

Prime Minister Netanyahu : "We are constantly in action on the northern front. As of now we have eliminated hundreds of Hezbollah militants and we are still poised – even today.

I just received a briefing from the head of Northern Command and I also spoke with the division commanders. We have detailed, important, and even surprising plans.

But I will not share these plans – which are designed to do two things, 1) to restore security to the north, and 2) to restore the residents safely to their homes – with the enemy. We are determined to achieve both of them together."

Also participating in the visit were the Prime Minister's Chief-of-Staff, his Military Secretary, the commanders of the 91st, 36th and 146th divisions, and other senior officers.
