Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Independence Day, made the following remarks at the International Bible Contest:

"The State of Israel could not exist without the blessed aliyah from the four corners of the world. This is the main foundation of Zionism which inscribed upon its banner the return to Zion and sees Israel as the home of every Jew in the world. Today it is completely clear that this is the home. This is in the place in which a Jew can walk in the street and say 'I am a Jew' or 'Je suis Juif'. We do not negate the responsibility of the various governments in the world to see to the security but we say to the Jews of the world 'This is home. This is our home. This is your home.'

From where did Zionism take the value of the ingathering of the exiles? From the Tanakh, from the prophets' vision of the ingathering of the exiles of Israel – from east and west – to our historical homeland.

Each wave of Aliyah greatly contributed to the development of the country. Therefore, I would like to call on you, the young people who are here, who have come from the Diaspora, I would like to tell you: Come home. Tell about the experiences of your visit in the country and about this quiz an then I ask – come back to us, to the Land of Israel! Make aliyah to the State of Israel! We are waiting for you with open arms."
