Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with Zehava Shaul, the mother of Oron Shaul, of blessed memory, who fell in battle during Operation Protective Edge in 2014, and whose remains were recovered two days ago in a military operation.

Zehava Shaul thanked the Prime Minister and told him: "You promised to bring him back – and you did so." The Prime Minister replied that this mission has been before him since then and until today, and now we have completed this mission. They recited together the verse [Jeremiah 31:16] – "There is hope for your future says the Lord, and your children shall return to their own border."

Prime Minister Netanyahu said that just as he promised to return Oron, of blessed memory, for burial, just as we have returned, as of now, most of our hostages from Hamas captivity, so we will continue to do. We will not rest or be silent until we also return home Hadar Goldin, of blessed memory, and all of our hostages, the living and the deceased, and we will achieve all the objectives of the war in Gaza.
