Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has personally acted regarding Naama Issachar in recent weeks. The Prime Minister discussed this issue with Russian President Vladimir Putin during his 12 September visit to Sochi and raised the issue again in their telephone conversation earlier this week. Also, the authorities in Israel have been active regarding Issachar throughout her detention. Israel has delivered a clear message: The punishment being demanded by the Russian prosecutor is disproportionate and does not fit the nature of the offense being attributed to Issachar. Prime Minister Netanyahu requested a commuting of the sentence and an easing of the terms of Naama's detention. To our regret, the Russian prosecution has not yet accepted to these requests. Judicial authorities in Israel have made it unequivocally clear that there is no possibility of preventing the extradition of Burkov following the Supreme Court ruling that he is subject to extradition. Following the Sochi meeting between Prime Minister Netanyahu and Russian President Putin, the Prime Minister telephoned Naama's mother and updated her on the discussion. Prime Minister Netanyahu and the State of Israel will continue to make every effort with the Russian authorities in order to bring about Naama Issachar's release and return her to her family. Prime Minister Netanyahu deeply appreciates President Putin's willingness to devote time to the issue and hopes that effort will bear fruit.
