PM Netanyahu underwent a series of tests at Hadassah Ein Kerem hospital, where he was treated by staff physicians Dr. Alon Hershko, Prof. Alon Moses and Dr. Asher Salmon. The Prime Minister – who went to the hospital due to a high fever and cough – was also accompanied by his personal physician, Dr. Tzvi Berkovitz.

Prime Minister Netanyahu finished the series of tests and was discharged and sent home. The tests indicated a minor viral infection of his upper respiratory tract. The doctors recommended rest and medication.
