Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu yesterdayissued the following statement at a Foreign Ministry conference for Israeli ambassadors:

"We are working systematically and level-headedly against all threats, including the threat from Hamas, with both defensive and offensive measures. Of course, if we are attacked from tunnels from the Gaza Strip, we will take very strong action against Hamas, much stronger than we took in Operation Protective Edge."
