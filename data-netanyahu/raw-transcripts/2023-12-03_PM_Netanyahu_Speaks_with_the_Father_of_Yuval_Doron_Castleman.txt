Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, after speaking on the telephone with Moshe, the father of Yuval Doron Castleman [translated from Hebrew]: "Yuval Doron Castleman is a hero of Israel. In a supreme act of bravery, Yuval saved many lives. However, unfortunately, a terrible tragedy occurred there â€“ and the man who had saved others was killed. There must be a thorough inquiry. I spoke today with Yuval's father Moshe, the salt of the earth, a Zionist family, an exemplary family. I and the entire people mourn with them over the death of a hero of Israel."
