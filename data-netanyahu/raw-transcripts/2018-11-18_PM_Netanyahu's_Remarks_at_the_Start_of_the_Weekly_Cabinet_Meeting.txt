Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting, made the following remarks:

"We have been talking with our American friends for some time about the present administration's new policy at the UN. Last Thursday, US Ambassador to Israel David Friedman updated me that the US had decided to vote against the traditional resolution condemning us for being on the Golan Heights. And this indeed happened. I would like to thank President Trump and Ambassador Haley on this important and just vote that is completely in keeping with my policy – Israel will always remain on the Golan Heights, and the Golan Heights will always remain in our hands.

On Thursday my wife and I visited the family of Lt.-Col. M, a hero of Israel, among our best. We met a noble and patriotic family, whom it was uplifting to see. I think that every Israeli citizen needs to be proud of such heroes and such people.

In recent days I have spoken with all of the coalition heads. This evening I will meet with Finance Minister Kahlon in an attempt to prevent the government from being toppled. At this sensitive time, vis-à-vis security, it would be both unnecessary and incorrect to go to elections."
