Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met, last night, with South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York City.

The two leaders reviewed an extensive list of areas for cooperation and agreed to hold coordinated staff work to evaluate the inherent possibilities in each field. They also discussed current international and regional issues.

Prime Minister Netanyahu at the start of the meeting:

"Mr. President, it's my pleasure to welcome you here. I think Israel and South Korea have great opportunities. We're both democracies, technological democracies, forward-looking democracies. I have a saying that the future belongs to those who innovate. We're both innovation nations and I think that if we cooperate we'll do even better together.

I want to take this opportunity, first, to invite you to come to Israel. You'll be the first Korean president to visit Israel while in office. I remember fondly my visit to Korea. So this will be a measure of friendly reciprocity.

In that opportunity I think that it would be wise to bring a delegation of business people, of technologists, so that we can work together to boost not only our trade but our cooperation and joint ventures and R&D in the future. And in that spirit I welcome you here as a great friend."
