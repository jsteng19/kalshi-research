UK Independence

parties.

Following is an excerpt of Prime Minister Netanyahu's remarks at the meeting:

"I had the opportunity now to discuss with the Prime Minister Cameron how to seize the opportunities and how to meet the challenges, and this is what I'd like to start my remarks with. I said in 10 Downing Street now, again, here’s the acid test. It’s simple. I’m willing right now, without any preconditions, any preconditions whatsoever, to sit down with President Abbas and negotiate this peace. I’m willing to go to Ramallah, yes, a nightmare for my security people. I often do that when I stop at falafel stands. They’re going to have to deal with it. Okay? Or President Abbas can come to Jerusalem, or for God sake, we can take up some of these suggestions for retreats in Sicily or fjords in Norway. Whatever. Anytime, anywhere, now, without preconditions."
