Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met today in his office, with outstanding National-Civic Service volunteers, who have been active on behalf of the needy in various areas and sectors of Israeli society, including the ultra-orthodox and Arab sectors, new immigrants, youth at risk, the ill, etc.

The volunteers briefed Prime Minister Netanyahu on their service and their contributions to the community. The Prime Minister noted that young people from the various groups and sectors within Israeli society – ultra-orthodox, Arabs and new immigrants – were represented among the outstanding volunteers.

Approximately 15,000 young people are currently volunteering with the Science and Technology Ministry's Administration for National-Civic Service. They are active in hospitals and with informal education and youth at risk. They also assist the needy in realizing their rights as citizens.

The National-Civic Service is designed for young people, between 18-24, who have either received exemptions from the IDF or who were not called upon to serve. During their service, they study in various courses that give them the tools to integrate into the labor market following their service.

Prime Minister Netanyahu told the volunteers that, "Your service is very important. You are strengthening both society and yourselves. Any society is measured by its ability to help the weak and needy and you are an important part of our society's ability to assist its weaker members. I congratulate you and wish you success."

Science and Technology Minister Daniel Hershkowitz also praised the volunteers and added that, "Accelerating the involvement of the ultra-orthodox and Israeli Arabs in voluntarism is a national mission."
