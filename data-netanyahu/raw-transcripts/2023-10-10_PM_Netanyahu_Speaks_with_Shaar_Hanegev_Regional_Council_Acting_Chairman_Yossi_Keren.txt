Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, spoke with Shaar Hanegev Regional Council Acting Chairman Yossi Keren:

"Yossi, I wanted to tell you that the entire people of Israel and I want to embrace and stand by you. We know the disaster that has befallen you; we know the magnitude of the pain. I also understand the size of the burden on your shoulders. I want you to know that we will do everything to help you and the residents at this time.

We are in the midst of a battle, a very difficult campaign, and it will be more difficult for them than they can imagine. The best will win.

We cannot go back to that situation, and we need to help you, however we can, to rebuild and we will do so. They, our enemies, also cannot go back to the situation they were in. They will not go back to the situation they were in â€“ I promise you that. What is important now is that you know that we all embrace you and take you into our hearts. These are not mere words but words from the heart."
