Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today in his Jerusalem office, met with members of the Israel Scouts movement, which is marking 90 years since it was founded. Today's meeting was ahead of tomorrow's conference of former Scouts movement members, at Ganei Yehoshua in Tel Aviv.

Prime Minister Netanyahu, a former Scout, commended the Scouts for the movement's major contributions to Israeli society over the past 90 years. He discussed his boyhood experiences as a Scout in Jerusalem and noted that his brother Yoni had been a Scouts counselor, adding that the Scouts branch in Mevaseret Tzion is named after him.

The Scouts gave the Prime Ministers a movement neckerchief and a copy of a book about the movement's history.
