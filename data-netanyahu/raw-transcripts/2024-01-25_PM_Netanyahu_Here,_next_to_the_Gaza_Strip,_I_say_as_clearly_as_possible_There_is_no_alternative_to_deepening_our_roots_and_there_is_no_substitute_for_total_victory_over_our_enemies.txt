Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, planted a tree in honor of Tu B'Shvat (https://www.jewfaq.org/tu_bshevat), together with soldiers of the 414th Battalion, at IDF Gaza Division HQ at the Reim base, where trees were planted in memory of Battalion and Division soldiers who have fallen in the war.

The Prime Minister met with female field observers and soldiers of the 414th Battalion, the duty of which – in routine and in war – is to locate, expose and attack the enemy by using advanced technologies. Prime Minister Netanyahu also visit the Division sports hall, which was hit in Hamas-ISIS's brutal attack on October 7.

Prime Minister Netanyahu to the soldiers [translated from Hebrew]:

"Here, in this place, on October 7, soldiers fell, the best of our sons and daughters, may G-d avenge them. Today we are planting trees in the blood and sorrow-soaked ground, living trees in their memory.

Hamas came to uproot us; we will uproot them. Hamas came to wipe us out; we will wipe them out. We will deepen our roots in our land and we will uproot our enemies. We will be here and they will not be there.

The most important thing is that we will continue to build up the communities – the moshavim and the kibbutzim. We will make them prosper, much more than previously, and we are committed to achieving total victory. Total victory mean eliminating Hamas and returning all of our hostages – we will not give in on this goal.

Therefore, on Tu B'Shvat, here, next to the Gaza Strip, I say as clearly as possible: There is no alternative to deepening our roots and there is no substitute for total victory over our enemies.

May we all have a happy holiday."

Also participating in the visit were the Prime Minister's Chief-of-Staff, Tzachi Braverman, and Brig.-Gen. Amit Yamin, former Commander of the Border Defense Corps and Gaza Division Chief-of-Staff in the war.
