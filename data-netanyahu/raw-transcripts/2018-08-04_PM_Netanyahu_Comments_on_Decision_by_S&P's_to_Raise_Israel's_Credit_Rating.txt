Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu commented on the decision of Standard and Poor's to raise Israel's credit rating [from "A+ stable" to "A+ positive"]:

"The decision by Standard & Poor's to raise Israel's credit rating joins a similar decision by Moody's. These decisions reflect the strength of the Israeli economy and the correct and responsible economic policy that we are leading on behalf of Israel's citizens."
