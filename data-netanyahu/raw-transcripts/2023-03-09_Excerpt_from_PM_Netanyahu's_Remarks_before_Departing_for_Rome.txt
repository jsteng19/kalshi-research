Following is an excerpt from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks, today, before departing for Rome:

"I have just finished an important and comprehensive meeting with US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin. I very much appreciated his remarks on behalf of President Biden, as well as the US commitment to Israel's security, also on behalf of the President. Our conversation focused primarily on our joint efforts to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. If anyone in Tehran thinks that Iran can make unhindered progress toward nuclear weapons, they are mistaken. I discern a change in the approach to Iran in recent months, both in the US and in the countries of Western Europe, and in the West in general. I see a need and an obligation to try and strengthen a more assertive approach with Iran. Of course, this will be at the center of my meeting with the Italian Prime Minister just as it was at the center of my meeting with President Macron. I intend to hold similar talks with principal European leaders in the near future."
