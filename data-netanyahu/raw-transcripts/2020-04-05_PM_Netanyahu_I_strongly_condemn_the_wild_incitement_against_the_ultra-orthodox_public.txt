Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu:

"I strongly condemn the wild incitement against the ultra-orthodox public, which has internalized the danger and the instructions from the Ministry of Health. The corona epidemic does not distinguish between the ultra-orthodox and the secular or between Arabs and Jews; neither will we. This war is all of ours; together we will win it. I stand by you."
