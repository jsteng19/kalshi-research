Following is Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu annual medical report as written by his personal physician, Dr. Tzvi Berkovitz:

Blood tests were completely normal including those for sugar, cholesterol and fats. The Prime Minister's blood pressure was normal (120/80), aided by light medication (as was reported last year).

Prime Minister Netanyahu trains several times a week at a gym (treadmill and weights) and is in good physical condition.

As befits his age, his prostate was examined last year and found to be enlarged, which is characteristic of his age. No pathological findings were seen; the Prime Minister's health is unaffected.

Dr. Berkovitz has determined that the Prime Minister's health is very good.
