Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara at the Knesset, attended the annual evening of song and poetry on the occasion of Remembrance Day for the Fallen of Israel's Wars and Victims of Terrorism.

The Prime Minister recited Ehud Manor's song 'Letter from Yoni' (drawn from the book "The Letters of Jonathan Netanyahu") in memory of his older brother Yoni Netanyahu, commander of the General Staff Reconnaissance Unit, who fell during the operation – named after him – to free the hostages at Entebbe in 1976. The Prime Minister said, "Ehud, with his artist's hand, composed a few lines from several letters that expressed the emotions of his heart and the song of Yoni's life."

Idan Amedi sang 'Letter to Yoni' (set to music by Rami Kleinstein)

The words of the song:

"Now I sit in the heart of the olive grove.

Except for the soldiers there is nobody here.

The leaves rustle on the ancient trees

because the wind quietly blows through them.

I would like us to be alone here always

with the world yet before us.

In my mind I now see the two of us

rising up to the Heavens

together touching the blue sky above us

hovering in the far distance.

I have many plans of course

And you my love are in all of them.

I will be 23 in another week.

I do not regret anything that I have done

And I will not be concerned about what I will yet do.

I still believe in my land and my people.

I still believe in you and in myself.

Did you read the note on the mirror?

Everything I wrote in it is completely true.

This morning I wanted you very much to know

that I truly love you.

I have already done so much as a soldier

that if I die now

it will be the joke of fate."
