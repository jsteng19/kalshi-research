In complete contravention of the claims of MK Yair Lapid, the minutes show that at eight Cabinet meetings, the Prime Minister, the ISA and IDF commanders raised the threat posed by tunnels crossing under the border fence into our territory. This is exactly as the former Defense Minister and the IDF have said previously.

MK Lapid should have studied – for example – the description of the strength of the threat posed by tunnels crossing into our territory as it was presented to members of the Cabinet, including MK Lapid, at the Cabinet meetings held on 12 January 2014, 16 February 2014, 13 March 2014, 16 June 2014 and 30 June 2014.

MK Lapid, who was a member of the Cabinet at the time of the Operation Protective Edge, should know that it is the responsibility of Cabinet members to be familiar with the material presented to them.
