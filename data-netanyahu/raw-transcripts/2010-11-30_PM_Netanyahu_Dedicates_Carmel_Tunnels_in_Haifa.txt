Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu participated in the festive opening of the

Carmel Tunnels

in Haifa, which will bisect the city and significantly cut travel times. Transportation Minister Yisrael Katz, Finance Minister Yuval Steinitz, Communications Minister Moshe Kahlon, Science and technology Minister Daniel Hershkowitz and Haifa Mayor Yonah Yahav also attended the ceremony, during which the Prime Minister dedicated the tunnel by riding in an open bus.

The

Carmel Tunnels

, which include roads, bridges and tunnels, were built with a NIS 1.5 billion investment. They include the longest tunnels in Israel, the largest interchange and the first intra-urban toll road. Forecasts show that the Tunnels will cut traffic on alternative routes by approximately 15%.

The project is the most sophisticated transportation project in the country and includes electronic sensors and dozens of cameras, and the latest safety features.

Prime Minister Netanyahu noted that he was proud to have both laid the project's cornerstone and dedicated it: "The project is part of a transportation revolution, which includes expressways to the Galilee, a railway to Eilat and a railway to link the Jordan Valley with Haifa, all of which will draw the periphery closer to the center of the country. On 13.1.97, as Prime Minister, I participated in the Tunnels' cornerstone-laying ceremony. Many years of bureaucracy have passed. We must reduce the time and make bureaucratic short-cuts. We must build the network of expressways and railways more quickly and also allow for faster planning. We are in the midst of a revolution and I believe that every Israeli will see the change soon. We are tunneling not just under Mt. Carmel but through the bureaucracy as well."
