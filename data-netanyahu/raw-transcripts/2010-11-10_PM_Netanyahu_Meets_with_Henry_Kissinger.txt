Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today made the following remarks at the start of his meeting with Henry Kissinger: "You helped to advance agreements that led to the historic peace with Egypt. It is likely that you have good advice on how to advance a similar goal today. Tomorrow, I will meet with US Secretary of State Hilary Clinton. I will discuss with her ways to achieve a peace agreement based on a broad understanding with the Palestinian people and perhaps with additional Arab states as well, an agreement based on security, which will give clear answers to Israel's security needs. We have broad understandings with the US on this issue, as on many others; they overcome the disagreements on other topics."
