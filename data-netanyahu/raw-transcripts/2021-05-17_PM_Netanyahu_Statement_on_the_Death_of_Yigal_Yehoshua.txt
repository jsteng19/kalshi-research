Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening:

"I share in the sorrow of the family of the late Yigal Yehoshua who was murdered in a lynch carried out by Arab rioters in Lod. We will settle accounts with whoever participated in this murder; nobody will escape punishment. May Yigal's memory be blessed and be bound in our hearts forever."
