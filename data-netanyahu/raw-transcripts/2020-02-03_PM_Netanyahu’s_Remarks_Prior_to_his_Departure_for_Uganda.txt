Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this morning, at Ben-Gurion International Airport, made the following remarks, prior to his departure for Uganda: “I am leaving now on another visit to Africa, my fifth in the past 3.5 years. Israel is returning to Africa in a big way; Africa has already returned to Israel. These are very important diplomatic, economic and security ties that will yet be told about. Today, I am traveling to Uganda. We are strengthening ties with this country. At the end of the day, I hope we will have very good news for the State of Israel.”
