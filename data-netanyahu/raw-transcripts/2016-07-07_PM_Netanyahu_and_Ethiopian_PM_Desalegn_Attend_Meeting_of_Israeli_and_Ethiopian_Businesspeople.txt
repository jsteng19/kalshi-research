Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn, this afternoon, in Addis Ababa, attended an economic forum with approximately 300 Israeli and Ethiopian businesspeople and senior company representatives, Ethiopian ministers and senior ministry officials.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"I have really come here to suggest to you a simple thing, actually to ask you to do one thing: invest in Ethiopia, invest in Africa. And I say to our Ethiopian friends: invest in Israeli know-how, invest in Israeli companies. This is a partnership made in heaven. It has a long history, but more importantly, it has a brilliant future. Invest in each other.

And when I say Israel, I don't just mean the government; I mean before the government and far more important than the government is our private firms who have developed in Israel in these and other areas. Theyâ€¦ Ultimately we want the business-to-business and business-to-government connections, with the support of the Israeli government.

The support could come in various ways, but the most important thing is to bring this assembly to bear so people can see: Here's a government that seeks your business, is open for business, wants your business; and here's a government that pushes you through the door, encourages you to go there and will support you in going there."
