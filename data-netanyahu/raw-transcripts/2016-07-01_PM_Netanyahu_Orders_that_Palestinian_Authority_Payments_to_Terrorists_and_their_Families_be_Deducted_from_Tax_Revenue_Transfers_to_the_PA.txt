Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, ordered that the amount of money being transferred by the Palestinian Authority to terrorists and their families be deducted immediately; this is in addition to action on the ground by the IDF and the security forces.

The Palestinian Authority transfers funds to terrorists by various laundering methods; the more severe the acts of terrorism, the greater the amount of funds. Prime Minister Netanyahu has ordered that the entire amount of support for terrorists and their families be deducted from the tax revenues that Israel transfers monthly to the Palestinian Authority.

Israel believes that the encouragement of terrorism by the Palestinian leadership – in the form of both incitement and payments to terrorists and their families – constitutes incentive for murder.
