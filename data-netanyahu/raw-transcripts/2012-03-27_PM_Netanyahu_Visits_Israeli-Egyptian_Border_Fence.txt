Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this afternoon, visited the area in which the Israeli-Egyptian border fence is being built; this was his fourth visit in the past two years. He received a security briefing from IDF Deputy Chief-of-Staff Maj.-Gen. Yair Naveh and GOC Southern Command Maj.-Gen. Tal Rousso.

At the conclusion of the visit, Prime Minister Netanyahu said:

"We held a very effective and focused discussion that will assist in leading the project toward its conclusion soon.

I come here every few months in order to see the progress firsthand. This barrier is designed to meet the threat of border infiltrations, which is one of the four challenges facing the State of Israel (along with the nuclear, missile and cyber threats). Dealing with this threat is a key to the future of the State of Israel, which is not big in terms of either size or population.

The Government did well when it decided to deal with this dangerous phenomenon. Think what our situation would be if we had delayed.

Within a decade, the country might have been flooded with hundreds of thousands of illegal work infiltrators. Such a magnitude could have led to the collapse of civil systems and harmed the character of the state.

The fence is a good response to illegal work

infiltrators, criminal smugglers and terrorists."

Prime Minister Netanyahu's plan to deal with illegal work infiltrators includes building a fence, enacting legislation to allow detention of up to three years, building a housing center, significantly increasing fines against those who employ illegal work infiltrators and formulating ways to repatriate infiltrators.

As of now, the Government has allocated approximately NIS 2 billion to deal with the phenomenon of illegal infiltration.
