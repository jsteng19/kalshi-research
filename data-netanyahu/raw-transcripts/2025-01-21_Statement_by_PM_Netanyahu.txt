Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this afternoon:

"On the directive of the Security Cabinet, the IDF, the ISA and the Israel Police have today begun an extensive and significant military operation to defeat terrorism in Jenin – 'Iron Wall'.

This is an additional step in achieving the objective that we have set – bolstering security in Judea and Samaria.

We are acting methodically and with determination against the Iranian axis wherever it reaches – in Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, and Judea and Samaria – and we are still active."
