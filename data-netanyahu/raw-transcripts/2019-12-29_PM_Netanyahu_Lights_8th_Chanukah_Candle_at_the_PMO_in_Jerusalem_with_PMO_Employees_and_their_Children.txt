Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, at the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) in Jerusalem, lit the eighth Chanukah candle with PMO employees and their children. Prime Minister Netanyahu said after the lighting: "I tell all of the adorable boys and girls here, and the employees of our office, we bring much light to the State of Israel. If the Maccabees who fought for our existence almost 2,000 years ago could have looked forward and seen that their descendants would establish a state that is now ranked as the eighth strongest in the world and that countries ranked above us have hundreds of millions [of people] and we have only nine million – then we are the Maccabees. We reestablished the independence of Israel, the sovereignty of Israel and the IDF – the State of Israel – in the Land of Israel. This is a very great privilege and we are celebrating here today, by the light of these candles, the realization of the prophets' dream. This is a tremendous and amazing thing. Thank you to all of you for the splendid and successful work that you do. Thank you to the boys and girls – you are the Maccabees."
