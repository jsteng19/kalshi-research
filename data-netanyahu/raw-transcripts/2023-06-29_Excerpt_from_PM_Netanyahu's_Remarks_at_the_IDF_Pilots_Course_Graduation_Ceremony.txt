Following is an excerpt from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks, today, at the IDF Pilots Course Graduation Ceremony, at Hatzerim Air Force Base:

Prime Minister Netanyahu [translated from Hebrew]:

"Our guiding principle is – whoever tries to harm us, we will harm them with great force.

We are working without respite against the attempts of Iran and its proxies to open terrorist fronts against us – in Syria, Lebanon, Gaza and in Judea and Samaria.

We are also working against Iran's efforts to develop terrorist cells and capabilities in neighboring countries, which are not countries in conflict with us.

We will not allow Iran to establish itself on our borders. We will not allow it to build precision weapons factories in Lebanon and Syria. And, of course, we will not accept Iran's intentions to develop a nuclear arsenal.

Even if an agreement is signed between the US and Iran regarding the latter's nuclear program, we will not be bound by this agreement.

We will maintain our right and our obligation to defend ourselves, with our own forces, against any threat whatsoever, throughout the Middle East. The Air Force has, and will have, a very important role in this."
