Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"This moment is very moving. On the way here, I thought about the children who are worrying about their parents, about the grandchildren who want to give their grandparents a real hug, about the business-owners who will be able to open their businesses, restaurant-owners, gyms; we will be able to go soccer fields, to see basketball games and, of course, to reopen the country and restore it to what it was, to go back to the normal life that we desire. This starts with this action. I ask everyone to join us and be vaccinated."

"I would like to thank you, Prof. Kreiss, Dr. Berkowitz and all the medical teams. I want to take this opportunity to thank a special person, Pfizer Chairman and CEO Albert Bourla, a new personal friend of mine but a huge friend of the State of Israel and a friend of all humanity. What they have done is unbelievable. What is even less of a given is that Israel is among the first countries to be vaccinating."
