Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem, convened the first discussion of the Ministerial Committee on Civilian Sector Preparedness for Emergency Situations. Prime Minister Netanyahu at the end of the discussion [translated from Hebrew]: "We held the first meeting of the Ministerial Committee on Civilian Sector Preparedness for Emergency Situations. We concentrated mainly on earthquakes. The State of Israel is located on the Syrian-African Rift; we have places that are destined for trouble. We are now relating to two main items: One, is to issue warnings and directives to the public on what to do in the event of an earthquake. We will hold a major exercise in November. Second, is to carry out preventive action by reinforcing structures in the most dangerous places. We established a director generals committee on this matter; this committee will also move forward led by the Defense Ministers and the participating ministers. I will also personally be involved. The main thing is to prepare the State of Israel for earthquakes and other mishaps. We believe that with proper preparations we will greatly reduce the damage and the price we will pay. We will do it and we will succeed." Defense Minister Gallant [translated from Hebrew]: "I thank the Prime Minister, my ministerial colleagues and everyone who is dealing with the important subject of how we will prepare for earthquakes. We have some tens of thousands of structures that we need to address so that in emergencies, people will not become trapped in them, Heaven forbid, in daytime or at night. The Defense Ministry, together with all the other agencies, knows how to do the work, and we will do what is necessary. I hope that we will make progress. This is good news for the citizens of Israel after many years in which the issue was not dealt with."
