Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, met with IDF and Israel Police commanders, foreign military commanders and students from the security services, who are graduates of the National Defense College.

The Prime Minister reviewed the various sources of Israel's strength and their contribution to building the national force and the way in which fostering economic resiliency and the development of military capabilities are combined.

Prime Minister Netanyahu discussed Israel's international relations and said that leaders and countries with which Israel has not had close relations, are drawing closer to Israel due to its rising status and growing strength.

The Prime Minister also discussed other issues, including the danger posed by the Iranian nuclear threat and the Israeli-Arab conflict, as well as civilian issues. He emphasized that Israel's social resiliency is the outer layer of its strength.

Prime Minister Netanyahu wished the graduates success in the future and told the foreign military commanders: "Remember that Israel is your loyal ally and that this is how we see you."

Prime Minister Netanyahu [translated from Hebrew]:

"What we basically did was to change the power of Israel relative to that of our neighbors.

I am pleased that we have shifted almost the entire Arab world to a default situation of non-belligerency, and peace treaties and normalization are gradually becoming clear. However, the greatest threat is Iran and it requires us to continue developing our strength.

If we do not do this, despite all of the other discussions that we hold between us, important and worthy as they may be, we will find ourselves in in a situation in which we cannot ensure our existence, and this is what Israeli governments must deal with, first and foremost."
