Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, appeared before the Policy Exchange in London where he was interviewed by author William Shawcross and answered questions from Exchange members. Following is an excerpt from the Prime Minister's remarks.

"Our focus in this visit was not about the deal. My real focus was about reversing Iran’s aggression in the region; namely, getting them out of Syria, all of Syria. That’s what I spoke about and I have to say that I found considerable agreement on that.

They have to recognize that we are not going to let Iran entrench themselves in Syria in order to not achieve their declared goal, and when I say declared, they declared again three days ago to destroy Israel.

They want to stockpile weapons, lethal weapons in Syria to be able to fire rockets into Israel, so we’re not going to sit there and wait for that to happen, so we’re taking action and we’ll continue to do that."

(Question: "And do you think the three countries with which you’ve been talking this week will accept this level of Israeli engagement?")

"Well, they backed us up actually against Iranian aggression I have to say and I’m very glad, because when Iran fires missiles at us from Syria and we took action against Iran, the European position actually was very supportive and I appreciate that, and I think it makes sense. This opposition to Iran’s aggression throughout the Middle East is shared by us and just about all the Arab states."
