Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today:

"We are fighting until victory. We will not stop the war until we achieve all of its goals: Completing the elimination of Hamas and releasing all of our hostages.

The choice I propose to Hamas is very simple: Surrender or die. They do not have – and will not have – any other choice.

And after we eliminate Hamas, I will use all my power to ensure that Gaza never again threatens Israel – neither Hamastan nor Fatahstan."
