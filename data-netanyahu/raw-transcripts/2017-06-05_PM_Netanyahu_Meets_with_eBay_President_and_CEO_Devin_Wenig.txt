Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with eBay President and CEO Devin Wenig. The two men discussed possibilities for expanding eBay's research and development – and the scope of its investments – in Israel.

Prime Minister Netanyahu emphasized the importance that the State of Israel places on innovation and the latent opportunities in the Israeli market. He said that the goal of the Government is to make it easier to do business in Israel by lowering corporate taxes and reducing regulation.

The head of the Prime Minister's staff, Yoav Horowitz and Prime Minister's Office Director General Eli Groner also attended the meeting.
