Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem, met with representatives of the families of the hostages.

Prime Minister Netanyahu, at the start of the meeting, on the effort to achieve an outline for the release of our hostages:

"We are making every effort. The more public this effort is, the more distant it is. The more discreet it is, the greater are its chances for success.

Naturally, and for these reasons, I am prevented from sharing with you.

I would like you to understand that we are truly committed, in every sense of the word; this is not just lip service.

This is a genuine effort. It is not fictitious; neither is it just for show. It stems from our commitment to return them all. The idea is everyone; the effort is for everyone.

While it is too early to say how it will happen, the effort is being made at this time, at this very moment." Twenty-six representatives from 18 families participated in this meeting.

The Prime Minister was accompanied by Coordinator for the Hostages and the Missing Brig.-Gen. (Res.) Gal Hirsch, National Security Council Director Tzachi Hanegbi, his Military Secretary, Maj.-Gen. Avi Gil and Cabinet Secretary Yossi Fuchs.
