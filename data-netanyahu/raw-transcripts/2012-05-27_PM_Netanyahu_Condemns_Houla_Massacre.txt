Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expresses his revulsion over the ongoing massacre being perpetrated by the forces of Syrian President Bashar Assad against innocent civilians, which continued over the weekend in Houla and included dozens of innocent children.

"Iran and Hezbollah are an inseparable part of the Syrian atrocities and the world needs to act against them," the Prime Minister said.
