Following are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks this evening at an event marking

20 years of diplomatic relations between Israel and China

"Israel and China are a successful combination because we are peoples rooted in glorious traditions that also embrace the future. The rise of modern China is one of the most important events of our time, as is the rise of modern Israel. We will never forget

the goodwill of the Chinese people who provided shelter for persecuted Jews in the darkest hours

. Millennia-old societies provide a strong basis for future cooperation in many fields. I believe that Israel and China can act together to ensure peace in the Middle East.

I was pleased to hear that China has begun to reduce oil purchases from Iran. I appreciate China's need to ensure a regular supply of sources of energy in order to continue its impressive growth. I believe that it is possible to replace Iranian oil and I hope that the Chinese leadership will join the European countries and quickly act to completely halt purchases of Iranian oil. Bilateral ties are important to us; therefore, we are committed to expanding them quickly in a variety of fields. To this end, I have issued a sweeping directive to approve any invitation to visit China. We are also launching a project that will bring to Israel 250 Chinese students a year. A large number of Israelis have already begun to study Chinese.

A Happy Year of the Dragon
