Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made the following remarks at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting today:

"At the beginning of my remarks, I would like to wish a rapid and full recovery to the soldiers and civilians who were wounded, and to strengthen the residents of the south who – with bravery and equanimity – are facing a complicated situation.

I would like to add that the IDF is operating, and will operate, aggressively against the terrorist organizations in the Gaza Strip, which are taking heavy blows from the IDF. The world needs to understand that Israel will not sit idly by in the face of attempts to attack us. We are prepared to intensify the response. At the same time we are closely monitoring what is happening on our border with Syria and there we are also ready for any development.

At our meeting today, we will be briefed on the activities of the Israel National Cyber Bureau that we established one year ago. Israel is a significant force in cyberspace. We are advancing, mainly on the problem of defending the modern state. Just as we developed the unprecedented Iron Dome system that successfully intercepts missiles, thus we are developing a kind of 'digital Iron Dome' in order to defend the country against attacks on our computer systems.

We will also be briefed on Science Minister Daniel Hershkovitz's satellites initiative. This has important consequences for the economy, for security and for science – here too Israel is achieving breakthroughs.

[Immigrant Absorption] Minister Sofa Landver will present us with a report on expatriate Israelis who are returning and on the many activities being carried out in this field, which are the result of decisions that we have made and the fruits of which we can currently see.

Thank you."
