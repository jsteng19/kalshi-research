Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, paid a condolence visit with the family of Rabbi Yehuda Deri, of blessed memory, the brother of MK Aryeh Deri, in Be'er Sheva.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu:

"Rabbi Yehuda was great in Torah and in practice. He was a charitable man of loving-kindness who was greatly loved and esteemed by all who knew him.

Indeed, what I have heard here certainly reflects his strength of spirit, Jewish wisdom, humanity and leadership. This genuinely attests to the magnitude of the loss. May his memory be blessed."
