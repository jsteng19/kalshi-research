Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, at the Kirya in Tel Aviv, convened a meeting of the ministerial committee on fighting the cost of living, which he chairs. The Economy, Finance and Health ministers presented the main points of the 'What is good for Europe is good for Israel' draft legislation on imports. The Prime Minister directed that the draft legislation be circulated for public comments within a week and that it be tabled in the Knesset during the current session. Prime Minister Netanyahu at the start of the discussion: ”We have major news today regarding the fight against the cost of living: What is good for Europe – is good for Israel. I would like to thank my colleagues – the ministers of Health, Economy, Finance, Energy and Agriculture, as well as the personnel at the Prime Minister's Office, and you, Professor Simhon, for your success in finally reaching agreement. We will submit the draft law this week for quick legislation in the Knesset. This will significantly lower the prices of cosmetics and food in the State of Israel. This is a great blessing."
