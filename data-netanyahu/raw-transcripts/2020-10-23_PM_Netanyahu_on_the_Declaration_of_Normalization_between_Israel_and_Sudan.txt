Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the declaration of normalization between Israel and Sudan: “Today we announce another dramatic breakthrough for peace, another Arab state joining the circle of peace. This time, it is normalization between Israel and Sudan. What a great turnaround! In Khartoum, the capital of Sudan, in 1967 the Arab League adopted its three ‘No’s’: ‘No to peace with Israel, no to recognition of Israel and no to negotiations with Israel.' However, today Khartoum has said, ‘Yes to peace with Israel, yes to recognition of Israel and yes to normalization with Israel.’ This is a new era, an era of true peace, a peace that is expanding with other Arab countries, with three of them joining in recent weeks. Delegations from Israel and Sudan will meet soon to discuss cooperation in many areas, including agriculture, trade and other areas important to our citizens. The skies of Sudan are open to Israel today. This allows for direct and shorter flights between Israel and Africa and South America. I thank the Chairman of the Sovereignty Council of Sudan, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and Sudanese Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok. I would like to again thank President Trump and his team for their part in this historic move. We are expanding the circle of peace. What excitement; there should be more."
