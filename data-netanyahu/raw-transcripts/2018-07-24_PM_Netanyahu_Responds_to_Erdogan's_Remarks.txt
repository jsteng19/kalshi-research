PM Netanyahu released the following statement

"Erdogan is massacring Syrians and Kurds and has jailed tens of thousands of his citizens. The fact that the great 'democrator' Erdogan is attacking the Nation-State Law is the greatest compliment for this law.

Turkey, under Erdogan's rule, is becoming a dark dictatorship whereas Israel scrupulously maintains equal rights for all its citizens, both before and after the law."
