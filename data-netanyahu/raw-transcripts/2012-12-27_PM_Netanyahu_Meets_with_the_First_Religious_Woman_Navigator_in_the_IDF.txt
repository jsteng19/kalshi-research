Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today at Hatzerim Air base, at the conclusion of the Air Force Flight Academy graduation ceremony in which new pilots received their wings, met with Tamar, the first religious woman navigator in the IDF.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said, "Tamar is an example of the equality between the sexes in Israel and proof that in the IDF there is place for all parts of Israeli society. It is important that more and more sectors become integrated into the IDF so that the burden may be shared more equitably and among more people."
