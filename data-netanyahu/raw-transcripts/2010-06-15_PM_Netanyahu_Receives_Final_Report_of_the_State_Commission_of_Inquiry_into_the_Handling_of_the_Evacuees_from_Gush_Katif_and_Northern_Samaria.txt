Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today (Tuesday), 15.6.10, met with the Chairman of the State Commission of Inquiry into the Handling of the Evacuees from Gush Katif and Northern Samaria by the Authorized Authorities, retired Judge Eliahu Matza, and received from him the Commission's final report.

Prime Minister Netanyahu told the members of the commission that he will continue to work intensively in order to implement the recommendations of the report and complete the handling of the evacuees: "Our goal is to bring each one of the evacuees into their permanent homes; this is our obligation as a government. As seen in the report, the current Government has acted, and will continue to act, to bring about a conclusion in the handling of the evacuees.

It is also very important to bring about closure on the discussion and in this the report will have a decisive role. All those involved need to study its conclusions. We will not tolerate foot-dragging."

In the final report, the Commission members noted the significant change that has taken place since the publication of the interim report in September of last year, "in advancing handling of the evacuees by the Government." The report also commended Prime Minister's Office Director-General Eyal Gabai for his, "active involvement" (see page 7 of the English summary of the final report).

Prime Minister Netanyahu instructed PMO Dir.-Gen. Gabai and Tnufa Administration Director Bentzi Liberman – who were also present, along with Commission members Dr. Shimon Ravid and Prof. Yedidia Z. Stern – to work towards the immediate implementation of the recommendations.
