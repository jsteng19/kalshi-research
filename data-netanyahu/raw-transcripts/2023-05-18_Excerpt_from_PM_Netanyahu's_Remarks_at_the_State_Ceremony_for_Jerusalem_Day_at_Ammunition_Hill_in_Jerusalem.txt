Following is an excerpt from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks, this evening, at the state ceremony for Jerusalem Day, at Ammunition Hill in Jerusalem:

[Translated from Hebrew]

"Despite the threats, and I would say, because of the threats, I directed that the flag march be held with the participation of thousands, properly and along its customary route.

We dealt heavy blows on those who attacked us in the Gaza Strip and I believe that the message was received and not just by them, but in other places in our region as well, that saw the impressive operational capabilities of the State of Israel.

And if an additional reminder proves necessary to restore deterrence â€“ it will also come. We have changed the equation."
