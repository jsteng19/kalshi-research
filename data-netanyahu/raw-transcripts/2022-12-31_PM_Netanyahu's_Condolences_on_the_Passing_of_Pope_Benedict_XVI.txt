Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening: "On behalf of all the citizens of Israel, I send my deep condolences to the Christian world on the passing of Pope Benedict XVI. He was a great spiritual leader who was fully committed to the historic reconciliation between the Catholic Church and the Jewish people, which he movingly expressed during his historic visit to Israel in 2009. In my meeting with him, he spoke warmly about the common heritage of Christianity and Judaism and the values that this heritage gave to all of humanity. We will remember him as a true friend of the State of Israel and the Jewish people."
