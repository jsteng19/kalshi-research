Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke at the start of a meeting of the Supreme Emergency Economy Committee, which discussed the effects of the security events on the economy and the formulation of immediate solutions:

"First of all, I would like to thank you for your important work. Coordinating all Government ministries and Home Front Command systems in order to defend the home front is a basic component of our ability to operate against the terrorist elements. I want to thank you, [Home Front Defense] Minister [Avi] Dichter and all those present for your systematic, very orderly work, which has one goal â€“ providing Israeli citizens with the directives and means to reduce the damage to them. This is our chief mission. I am pleased to see you doing this work continuously, systematically and thoroughly. It is yet required of us. You are doing excellent work. Continue to see to the home front. You are helping save lives. Your work and the discipline of the people gives us the ability to make the right, considered and responsible decisions in order to defend the State of Israel."

Committee Chairman Minister Dichter said, "We are in the midst of an unprecedented assault on the Israeli home front: 1,000 missiles in four days against 3.5 million residents. This has no parallel in any country. The State of Israel has invested billions in order to prepare the home front just for such difficult times. The committee is meeting here today with the full representation of Government ministries in order to ensure the continual functioning of the state. We must understand that in the end, the great national pyramid rests on the citizen who is called upon to carry out the instructions of the IDF Home Front Command as soon as sirens are heard and enter a protected space or lay on the ground. Not everyone has acted this way in recent days and we have paid a heavy price for this."
