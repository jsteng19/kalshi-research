Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu shares in the sorrow of the family of the police officer who was murdered yesterday en route to a seder meal to celebrate the first night of Passover.

The Prime Minister said: "This reprehensible murder of a man who was traveling with his family to a meal for the Festival of Freedom is the result of the incitement for which the Palestinian Authority is responsible. The Palestinian Authority continues to constantly broadcast – in its official media – programs that incite against the existence of the State of Israel. Last night this incitement was translated into the murder of a father who was traveling with his family to celebrate the first night of Passover. The incitement of the Palestinian Authority continues in that it has yet to see fit to condemn this abominable and reprehensible act."
