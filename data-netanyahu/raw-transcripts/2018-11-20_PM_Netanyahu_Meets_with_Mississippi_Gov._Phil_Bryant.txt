Prime Minister Netanyahu at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem, met with Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant.

"You have been a stalwart friend of Israel and a great champion of the Israeli-America alliance, and I want to welcome you here. Thank you for your enduring support. I want to talk to you about cyber. I want to talk to you about fighting BDS. I want to talk to you about strengthening this incredible alliance against our common enemies, and also for our common challenges—for peace, security and prosperity."

"This is my fourth visit to Israel, third visit with you. You’ve been so kind over the years. I bring welcome from President Trump, my dear friend, who called me on Sunday night at 02:00 Israeli time to make sure that I expressed our strong support of Israel, not only in Mississippi, but across the United States and his administration again for peace in our world and in our time, and you are doing so much to help us reach that and we thank you for that."

"We appreciate what President Trump is doing and his effort to contain Iranian aggression, which is the greatest danger to the peace of the world."
