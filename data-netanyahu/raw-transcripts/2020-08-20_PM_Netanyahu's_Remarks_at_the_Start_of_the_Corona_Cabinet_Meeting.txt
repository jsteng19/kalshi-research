Following are Prime Minister Netanyahu's remarks, today, at the start of a meeting of the Corona Cabinet: "I ascribe great importance to an additional discussion of the ruling on the demolition of the home of the terrorist who murdered Amit Ben-Yigal. The Attorney General acceded to my request, which was also the request of the Defense Minister. This is important because anyone who harms citizens of Israel needs to be dealt with to the fullest extent of the law. This morning, I held a discussion with the economic leadership at which was presented an important plan to encourage employment and professional training. We will submit it to the Cabinet as necessary. I would also like to commend Finance Minister Yisrael Katz and Education Minister Yoav Gallant who, today, resolved the problem of afternoon daycare, the HILA program, Project Karev and also national service (sherut leumi). The very important issue of national religious education remains and I am certain that a solution for it will be found as well. We will continue to act responsibly on behalf of the citizens of Israel and it is important that we do everything to prevent another election, to pass a budget that the country needs and proceed according to needs related to the coronavirus. National coronavirus project manager Prof. Gamzu will brief us today. We will hear his various recommendations. There is a major effort to avoid a lockdown in order to continue towards rehabilitating the economy, and I think that this will be related, of course, to the morbidity situation. We will hear Prof. Gamzu's recommendations. We are all awaiting this with great interest."
