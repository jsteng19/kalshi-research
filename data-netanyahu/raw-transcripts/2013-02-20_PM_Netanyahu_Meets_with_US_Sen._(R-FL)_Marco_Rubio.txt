Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, met with US Senator (R-FL) Marco Rubio. The Prime Minister said: "I appreciate your support. I appreciate the tremendous support of the American people, bipartisan support for our security and our quest for peace. It's a daunting task, both security and the quest for peace, but we know we have your support and we appreciate it. I look forward to talking with you about our challenges."

Sen. Rubio said: "Well, you live in a challenging neighborhood but the Israeli-American relationship is one of the most important ones we have, and certainly our commitment to that partnership is bipartisan and it should remain that way. And that's why I'm pleased the President is coming here in March."
