Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, earlier today (Friday, 6 September 2019), made the following remarks prior to his departure from London at the conclusion of his diplomatic visit: "We have just completed a very successful diplomatic visit with very good meetings with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Secretary of State for Defence Ben Wallace. Yesterday evening I had an important meeting with US Secretary of Defense Mark Esper. We discussed the entire region â€“ from Iran, to Syria, Lebanon, Hezbollah and various challenges and attacks against us, the actions that we undertook to thwart them, the coordination that we are called upon to make especially regarding Syria, and many other things. My meeting yesterday with Secretary of Defense Esper was one between two countries that greatly support each other. The alliance between the US and Israel has never been stronger. This finds expression in very many concrete things and in cooperation in every field related to the security of Israel."
