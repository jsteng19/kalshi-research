Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this morning, at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting, made the following remarks:

"Over the weekend we began building the above-ground barrier along the Gaza border. The barrier will prevent terrorists from Gaza from penetrating into our territory on the ground.

I would also like to make it clear: If the quiet is not maintained in Gaza, we will make the decisions even in the elections period and will not hesitate to act."

"In Iran today they are marking 40 years since the Islamic revolution and are trying to boast about the new missile. Iran openly declares its intention to destroy the State of Israel.

I have a clear message to the tyrants of Tehran: We know what you are doing and where you are doing it. We will continue to take action against Iran with all the tools at our disposal in order to ensure the security and future of Israel."

On the confirmation of Israel's credit rating:

"You have certainly noticed another achievement for the Israeli economy. Standard & Poor's confirmed Israel's high credit rating. The previous rating was provisional and the company has now made it permanent. This is a very strong expression of confidence in the economic policy that we have led in recent years, which has led the Israeli economy to unprecedented growth."

On the launch of the first Israeli satellite to the moon:

"This week we will mark international space week. I have just seen a model of the Beresheet satellite that will be launched to the moon and I hope that we will also land it on the moon. This will, of course, be great pride for Israel.

The project puts Israel in one rank with the world's major powers. The citizens of Israel and all of us can be proud. We are turning Israel into rising global power with all that this entails."
