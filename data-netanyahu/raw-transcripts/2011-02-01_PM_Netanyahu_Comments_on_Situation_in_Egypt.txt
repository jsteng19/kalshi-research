In talks with diplomatic officials today Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu noted that Israel's interest is maintaining the peace with Egypt. Israel believes that the international community must insist that any Egyptian government maintain the peace treaty with Israel.

Israel is a democracy and supports the advance of liberal and democratic values in the Middle East. The advancement of those values is good for peace.

But if extremist forces are allowed to exploit democratic processes to come to power to advance anti-democratic goals – as has happened in Iran and elsewhere – the outcome will be bad for peace and bad for democracy.
