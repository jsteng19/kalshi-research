Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today decided to add the phrase, "a Jewish and democratic state" to the loyalty oath – "I promise to honor the laws of the State" – in the Citizenship Law.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said that, "The State of Israel the national state of the Jewish People. This principle guides Government policy, both foreign and domestic, and is a foundation of Israeli law. This principle finds expression in the phrase 'a Jewish and democratic State'. It is fitting that this principle should also appear in the loyalty oath taken by those seeking to become naturalized Israeli citizens."

On Sunday, 10.10.10, the amendment to the Citizenship Law will be submitted for Cabinet approval.
