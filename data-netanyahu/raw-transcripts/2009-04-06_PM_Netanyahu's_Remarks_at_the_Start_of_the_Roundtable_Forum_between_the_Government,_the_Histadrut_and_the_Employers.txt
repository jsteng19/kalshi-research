Following are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks today at the start of the roundtable forum between the Government, the Histadrut and the employers:

"This is the first meeting of the roundtable forum. We will hold a series of discussions in the future. This forum was decided upon in the coalition negotiations. We determined that there would be a framework for discussions and dialogue between the three main factors in the economy – the Government, the Histadrut and the employers.

I welcome the good spirit and the assistance that you are prepared to extend. We have a gigantic task and the first obligation is to help Israeli citizens and maintain their jobs. This is a global mission. A wave of unemployment is engulfing every country, including ours. We are committed – first of all – to Israeli workers and must, to the best of our ability, try to reduce the scope of the wave of unemployment and turn the economy around in order to move it in the direction of growth, with all that this signifies. It will be much better to do this together.

We have decided upon a framework for consultation and we will begin significant discussions immediately after the Passover holiday. I think that all those who are sitting around this table greatly desire to reach agreement on the best way to get the Israeli economy moving and save jobs. I do not think that I could have expected better partners than those sitting here beside me. I think that this spirit of partnership and of responsibility will help us to rescue the economy from this crisis."
