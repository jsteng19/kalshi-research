Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, met with participants of this year's International Bible Quiz, which will take place on Independence Day, next Tuesday, 16 April. Also participating in the meeting were IDF Chief Education Officer Brig.-Gen. Eli Shermeister and quiz coordinator Rabbi Maj. Eliezer Amoyal. This year's will be the 50th quiz; 58 young people, aged 12-18, from 26 countries – including Finland, Turkey, Colombia, Latvia and Costa Rica – will participate.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said, "The Bible is the foundation of our existence, our right to exist, and our right to this land even though there are those who try to deny this. In my view, it is the basis of our existence and it is important that this basis also be understood among the nations of the world and not just among us. I ascribe great importance to teaching the Bible and this is how it is in my family. I am pleased to hear that it is similarly important in your families and communities. I welcome you to Israel and wish you all good luck."

IDF Chief Education Officer Brig.-Gen. Shermeister said, "We are happy to meet here, and not for the first time. We know how much you, Mr. Prime Minister, appreciate and esteem the Bible and those who study it. Your wife's family is one of Bible students and her late father, Shmuel Ben-Artzi, was a Bible scholar. Your son Avner finished third in the 2010 quiz, which should be successful for everyone."
