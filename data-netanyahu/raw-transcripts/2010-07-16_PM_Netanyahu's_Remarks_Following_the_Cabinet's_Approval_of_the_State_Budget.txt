"Two severe crises – one local and one international – have hit the Israeli economy in the last decade. We emerged from both of them because we had, over the years, a responsible and visionary economic policy and today we are continuing it.

The budget that we are submitting today is responsible and balanced. It adds a layer of stability to the State of Israel and the Israeli economy over the next two years. I cite our friend, Bank of Israel Governor Prof. Stanley Fisher. Yesterday, he said: 'This is an excellent budget.' I thank Finance Minister Yuval Steinitz and the ministers for their responsible leadership. The Government did not breach the budgetary framework. Economically, both nationally and internationally, this is very important. In any country, it is the public that, in the end, pays for deviations from the budgetary framework and for the uncontrolled spending of public funds. Perhaps it is not clear initially that such a breach is being carried out, but all that one needs to do is look at what has happened in several leading countries in Europe. We will not permit such irresponsibility to take place in the State of Israel.

The current budget makes an effort to balance between education, social needs and spreading a national transportation network, and between the State of Israel's considerable national security needs. Naturally, it was not possible to accede to all the demands made on Government ministries. I must say that while most of these demands are legitimate and important, it is the role of Government and leadership to consider priorities and make decisions. I believe that in my discussions this morning with Finance Minister Steinitz and Defense Minister Ehud Barak, we made a responsible decision and I submit it for your approval."
