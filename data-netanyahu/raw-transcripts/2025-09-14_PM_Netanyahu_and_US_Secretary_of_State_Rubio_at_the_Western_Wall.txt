Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara Netanyahu visited today (Sunday) the Western Wall in Jerusalem, together with Secretary of State of the United States Marco Rubio and his wife, and United States Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee and his wife.

The Prime Minister and the Secretary of State held a joint prayer for the well-being of the hostages, and a special prayer honoring President of the United States Donald Trump, a true friend of the Jewish people and the State of Israel. Afterwards, they placed a note among the stones of the Wall and toured the archaeological site of the Western Wall tunnels.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu:

"We are greeting the extraordinary friend of Israel, Secretary of State of the United States Marco Rubio and his wife Jeanette.

I think his visit here is a testament to the durability, the strength of the Israeli-American alliance. It's as strong and as durable as the stones of the Western Wall that we just touched.

Under President Trump and Secretary Rubio and their entire team, this alliance has never been stronger, and we deeply appreciate it, not only on behalf of the people of Israel who live today, but generations of Jews who preceded us, and hope that we build our state anew with friends like you. Thank you, Marco".
