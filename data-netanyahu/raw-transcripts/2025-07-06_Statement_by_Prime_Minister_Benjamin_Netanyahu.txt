Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today:

"I would like to send my best wishes for a speedy recovery to the employees of the American aid foundation, who were wounded in the terrorist incident that was perpetrated by Hamas terrorists at the food distribution facility.

The foundation employees are doing important work and I thank them and President Trump for the aid.

The entire world needs to stand up and condemn the severe incident, which again reveals the brutality of Hamas.

The UN must stop opposing the activity of the aid foundation and act in concert so that the latter might continue to safely act on behalf of the residents of the Gaza Strip."
