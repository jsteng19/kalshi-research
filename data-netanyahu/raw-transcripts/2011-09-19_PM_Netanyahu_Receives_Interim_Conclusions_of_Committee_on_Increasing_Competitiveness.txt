Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today received the interim conclusions of the committee on increasing competitiveness in the economy. He thanked Finance Ministry Director-General Haim Shani, who chaired the committee, outgoing Prime Minister's Office Director-General Eyal Gabai and all the other members of the committee.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said:

"The committee did thorough and professional work in both studying the subject and giving real solutions. The committee's conclusions will lead to substantive changes in the Israeli economy and to the cancellation of the situation that has prevailed for decades, of involvement and major control by a few groups.

These steps, along with those of the special committee that I appointed, chaired by Prof. Manuel Trajtenberg, will lead to a genuine revolution in the Israeli economy in favor of the consumer who is groaning under the illogical cost-of-living.

My Government has emphasized the implementation of reforms: We have upgraded teachers' conditions. We have increased police salaries. We reached a revolutionary agreement with the doctors. We have expanded firefighting activity. And more than anything, we brought about a significant breakthrough in priorities for the periphery. We have drawn its residents closer to the center through unprecedented investments in infrastructures.

My Government is committed to continue implementing the economic reforms alongside the security steps that are designed to ensure the Israelis' peace and welfare."
