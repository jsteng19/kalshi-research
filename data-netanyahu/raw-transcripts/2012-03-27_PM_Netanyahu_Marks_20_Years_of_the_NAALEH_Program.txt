Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu yesterday evening, met with graduates of, and participants in, the NAALEH program, to mark its 20th anniversary. In the framework of NAALEH, Jewish youths, age 15-16, come to Israel for high school and, at the conclusion of their studies, immigrate to the country.

Among the participants in the meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu were graduates and pupils from 15 countries, including: Russia, Ukraine, Canada, the UK, Germany, France, Argentina, Brazil and Mexico. Participating NAALEH graduates include IDF officers, outstanding lecturers and researchers, high-tech entrepreneurs, social activists and artists. Jewish Agency Chairman Natan Sharansky and NAALEH's directors from the Education Ministry, Yechiel Shilo and Yeshayahu Yechieli, were also in attendance.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said, "I am impressed by the personal journey that each of you has made in immigrating to Israel. Your success has been extraordinary. Immigrating in general and immigrating at a young age – without your families – in particular, is a major step. I appreciate this, both personally and on a national level. You are building up the country. Israeli society is built on the younger generation."

Prime Minister Netanyahu wished the NAALEH pupils and graduates a Happy Passover. "Without a doubt, NAALEH is a type of exodus from Egypt. I hope that each one of you continues to climb higher and higher here in the Land of Israel."
