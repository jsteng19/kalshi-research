Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, at the start of a meeting of the subcommittee on advancing the fight against crime in the Arab sector in Israel:"We all welcome the fact that the Arab sector in Israel is showing solidarity with our fight against Hamas. However, it must be said that the criminal organizations are continuing to strengthen, and are now using weapons that are more lethal than in the past such as claymores and LAW rockets. Therefore, the fight against the criminal organizations must be stepped up.

To this end, today we will submit three steps: The first step is legislation against lethal war materiel. A second step is convening the 'elite team' on a weekly basis for a continuous fight against terrorism, even during the war. A third step, which will be coordinated by Roi Kahlon, is establishing an additional working team for a focused war on crime. These are the three steps.

We will certainly discuss other items as well but we cannot neglect the war on the criminal organizations, even during the major war effort that we are making on all fronts."

Also attending the meeting were the Justice Minister, the National Security Minister, the Interior Minister, the Social Equality Minister, the Diaspora Affairs Minister, the Prime Minister's Chief-of-Staff, the Prime Minister's Office Director General, the Director of the National Security Council, the Israel Police Inspector General, the Cabinet Secretary, the Prime Minister's Military Secretary, the head of the staff for dealing with crime in the Arab sector, the Attorney General, the Director of the National Economic Council, the Interior Ministry Director General, the Finance Ministry Director General, the Director of the Tax Authority and ISA representatives.
