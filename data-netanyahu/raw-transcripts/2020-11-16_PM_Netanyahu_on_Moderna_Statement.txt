Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"Already in June I, along with Health Minister Yuli Edelstein, instructed that an agreement be signed with Moderna for the supply of vaccines. Today, Moderna informed us that its vaccine has an efficacy of 94.5%. This is excellent news for the State of Israel.

My goal is to bring as many vaccines as possible, from as many sources as possible, to as many citizens as possible â€“ and as soon as possible."
