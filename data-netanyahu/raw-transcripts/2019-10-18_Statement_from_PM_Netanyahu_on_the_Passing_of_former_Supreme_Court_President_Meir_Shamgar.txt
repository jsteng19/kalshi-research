Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this morning, issued the following statement: "I express deep sorrow over the passing of former Supreme Court President Meir Shamgar, who was among the State of Israel's greatest jurists. Meir Shamgar had an important role in shaping the foundation of Israeli jurisprudence including legal policy in Judea and Samaria. I will always recall with esteem our joint activity in managing the Yonatan Institute after the passing of my brother Yoni. May Meir's memory be blessed."
