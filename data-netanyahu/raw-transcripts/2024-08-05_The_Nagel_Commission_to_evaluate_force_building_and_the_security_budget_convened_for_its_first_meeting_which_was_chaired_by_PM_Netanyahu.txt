In Accordance with the Prime Minister's Directive to Establish a Commission to Evaluate the Security Budget, the Nagel Commission met Yesterday

The Nagel Commission to evaluate force building and the security budget convened yesterday, for its first meeting, which was chaired by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The Defense Minister, the Finance Minister, the Director of the National Security Council, the Governor of the Bank of Israel, the IDF Deputy Chief-of-Staff and the Finance Ministry Budget Director also attended the meeting.

The Commission, headed by Brig.-Gen. (Res.) Jacob Nagel, includes the leading experts in the various fields necessary for its work, as may be seen in its 12 carefully chosen members.

In appointing the Commission members, special emphasis was given to the economic and budgetary aspects, the security aspects and the security outlook (while taking into consideration the events of October 7) and the high public profile required of the Commission members – men and women alike – in order to give validity to its recommendations.

As per its mandate, the Commission will evaluate and formulate recommendations regarding force building needs and the security budget in the coming decade while taking into account the economic significance and the effects on the state budget and the economy.

In light of the importance of the Commission's work and its influence on the security budget, Prime Minister Netanyahu emphasized the urgency in submitting its recommendations and directed that its work be concluded within four months, and that its interim conclusions be presented during its work – without impairing the depth of the evaluating.

The Prime Minister wished the Commission great success in its important work for the national security of the State of Israel.
