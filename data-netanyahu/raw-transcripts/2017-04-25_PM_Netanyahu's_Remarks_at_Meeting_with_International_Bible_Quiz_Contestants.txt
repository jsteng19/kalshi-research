Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today , made the following remarks at a meeting with contestants in the upcoming International Bible Quiz:

"I am leading Israel's foreign relations to unprecedented growth. But I am doing so based on a proud and assertive national policy, not out of weakness and with a bowed head. Our relations with Germany are strong and important and will also continue as such. My policy is clear: Not to meet with diplomats who visit Israel and meet with organizations that slander IDF soldiers and seek to put our soldiers on trial as war criminals. Those same diplomats would never dream of doing this in the US or UK, or in any other place. Our soldiers are the basis of our existence. They guard us and we will guard them."
