Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today:

"In an IDF and ISA operation in the Gaza Strip, the body of Ilan Weiss, of blessed memory, which had been held by the murderous Hamas terrorist organization, has been brought back to Israel. Also returned in the operation were the remains of another deceased hostage whose name has yet to be released for publication. The remains are now being identified at the Institute of Forensic Medicine.

Ilan Weiss, a hero, was a member of the emergency squad at Kibbutz Be'eri. He was murdered on 7 October 2023 as he went out to defend the kibbutz; his body was taken hostage.

His wife Shiri and their daughter Noga were taken hostage and released from captivity in November 2023.

Together with all citizens of Israel, my wife and I convey our heartfelt condolences to the dear families and share in their deep sorrow.

I thank our commanders and fighters for their successful action, determination and bravery.

The campaign to return the hostages is ongoing. We will neither rest nor be silent until we bring all of our hostages back home, the living and the deceased."
