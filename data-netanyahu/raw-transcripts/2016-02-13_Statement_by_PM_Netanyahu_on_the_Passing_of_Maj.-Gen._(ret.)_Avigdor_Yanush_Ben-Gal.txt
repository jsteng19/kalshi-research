Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this evening released the following statement:

"Along with the entire Israeli people, I grieve over the passing of Maj.-Gen. (ret.) Avigdor 'Yanush' Ben-Gal, an Israeli hero. During the darkest days of the

Yom Kippur War

, when the fate of Israel hung in the balance, Yanush and his brave soldiers defended our northern border with their bodies. They blocked the Syrian advance and afterwards went on the offensive that led the IDF to the gates of Damascus. Yanush was a dedicated soldier with extraordinary courage and inspiration. He will be remembered as one of Israel's greatest commanders."
