Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will, next month, submit for Cabinet approval, a plan for significant investments in Druze and Circassian communities including education, infrastructures, employment, etc. in order to reduce existing gaps and move the communities forward. Last week, Prime Minister Netanyahu met with Druze community leaders led by spiritual leader Sheikh Muwafaq Tarif and updated them on his intention to submit the plan for Cabinet approval soon. The Prime Minister promised that the nationality law would not harm their status and would even entrench their equality in Israeli society. "You are our very flesh. You are an organic part of Israeli society. Your heroic policemen and soldiers have fallen in order to defend the state and all its citizens but we will defend your rights and your security. This is as important to us as defending the security of each and every citizen."
