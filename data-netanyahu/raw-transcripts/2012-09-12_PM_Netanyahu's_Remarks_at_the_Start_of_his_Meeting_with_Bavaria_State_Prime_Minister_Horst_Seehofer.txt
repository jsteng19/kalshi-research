Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today made the following remarks at the start of his meeting with Bavaria State Prime Minister Horst Seehofer:

"We are facing great challenges. As Prime Minister of Israel, it is my duty to uphold the vital interests of the State of Israel, to ensure its security and its future. The greatest interest today is to prevent Iran from continuing on its clear steps to achieving nuclear weapons, this from a country that calls for our destruction and intends to achieve its goal. I uphold these interests, not that it's easy, because leadership is tested in upholding them even if there are disagreements with friends, even the best of friends. This is what I have done and this is what I will continue to do for the State of Israel and the security of its citizens."
