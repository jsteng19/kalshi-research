Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today signed a statement of cooperation with

Keren Hayesod

regarding several projects of national importance. The statement is designed to strengthen and ratify the historic cooperation between Keren Hayesod donors and the state of Israel and express appreciation for their 90 years' of contributing to the Zionist enterprise.

Leading the projects that Keren Hayesod will support is Prime Minister's Office project regarding national heritage sites.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said that he ascribes great importance to the cooperation: "On behalf of the Government of Israel, I would like to thank you for the assistance that you have rendered to the State of Israel over the decades. Keren Hayesod serves as a living bridge between the millions of Jews around the world and the State of Israel. I am pleased to continue this welcome cooperation and ask that Keren Hayesod continue to enlist world Jewish communities in support of the projects that are important to the State of Israel."
