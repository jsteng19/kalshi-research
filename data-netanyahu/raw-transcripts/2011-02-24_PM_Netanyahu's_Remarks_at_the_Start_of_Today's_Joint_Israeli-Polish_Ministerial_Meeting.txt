Following are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks at the start of the joint Israeli-Polish ministerial meeting today:

"We will have a second, productive meeting between the Israeli and Polish governments. We are promoting, with tangible actions,

our deep bilateral cooperation

, which is based on common values and a shared history, as well as on the aspiration to a common future in which we want to achieve the same goals. Therefore, I view this as having practical and symbolic importance and I welcome the cooperation between us.

Again, welcome to Jerusalem."
