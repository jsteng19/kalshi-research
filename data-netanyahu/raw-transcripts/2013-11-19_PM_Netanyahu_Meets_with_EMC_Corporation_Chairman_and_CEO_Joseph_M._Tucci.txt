Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with EMC Corp. Chairman and CEO Joseph M. Tucci. Prime Minister's Office Director General Harel Locker and Israel National Cyber Bureau Head Dr. Eviatar Matania also attended the meeting at which it was agreed that EMC would join an INCB, Be'er Sheva Municipality and Ben-Gurion University initiative to assist in the construction of a national cyber center in the Negev.

EMC Corp. and CEO Tucci stressed that he views Israel as a global cyber leader and noted that EMC, which was a pioneer in 2011 when it established a research and development center in Be'er Sheva that focused – inter alia – on security technologies, will establish and lead the "National Cyber Center Development Organization". The organization will represent the cyber agencies and organizations at the center and will serve as the INCB's partner in developing the center. EMC will also invest the necessary resources and know-how to establish "Cyber-Gate, the National Israeli Cyber Teaching and Demonstration Center."

Tucci also said that the company's activities in Be'er Sheva are expected to be significantly expanded over the next two years and will deal with – inter alia – the development of specific solutions for the Defense Ministry and IDF units, which are among the company's customers in Israel. He updated Prime Minister Netanyahu on EMC's expansion plans in Israel and informed him about the establishment of an additional research and development center in northern Israel, in addition to the company's six sites in the center and south of the country.
