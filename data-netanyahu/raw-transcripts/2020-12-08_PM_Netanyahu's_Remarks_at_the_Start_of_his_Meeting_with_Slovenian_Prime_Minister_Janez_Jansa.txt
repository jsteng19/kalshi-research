Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem, made the following remarks (in Hebrew) at the start of his meeting with Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Jansa: "Yesterday I convened the Corona Cabinet in order to discuss ways to lower morbidity and the basic reproduction number, which have jumped dramatically in recent days. As of tomorrow, we expect to enact a plan the goal of which is to lower morbidity in an effort to avoid a lockdown. Our goal is to avoid a lockdown as much as possible. We are considering a series of steps that we will need to decide on this evening and in the course of government discussions including the question of a night curfew and – of course – restrictions between areas, tightening red areas and the like. I asked that the green islands program be continued; it will apparently require legislation. It is also important to understand now – we see the end. The vaccines will arrive very quickly. Already in the coming days the first vaccines will be here. We see the end but we must not, as in war, when we see the end of the war, we must not lose people. People will die and will be stricken with a serious disease for no reason – it is possible to prevent this. I need your cooperation both in keeping the Health Ministry directives and the restrictions. Whoever says 'How can this be?' All of the countries, without exception, I talk with them, with leaders from Europe, from the world. All countries are imposing lockdowns and measures that are much harsher than ours because they did not make the critical decisions at the right time. We are doing this. We made the right decisions and as a result morbidity and mortality in Israel are among the lowest in the world, certainly in the western world. We are succeeding in fighting the coronavirus and see the end. Cooperate. Do not listen to the voice of populism. We are making the right decisions."
