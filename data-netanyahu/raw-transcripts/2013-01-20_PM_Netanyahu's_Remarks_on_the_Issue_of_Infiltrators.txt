Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, made the following remarks, on the issue of infiltrators, at the weekly Cabinet meeting:

"Last month, a total of seven infiltrators reached the fence on the southern border and none of them entered Israel's cities. In the past seven months, no infiltrators have entered Israel's cities. This is one of the most important things we have done in order to safeguard the State of Israel."
