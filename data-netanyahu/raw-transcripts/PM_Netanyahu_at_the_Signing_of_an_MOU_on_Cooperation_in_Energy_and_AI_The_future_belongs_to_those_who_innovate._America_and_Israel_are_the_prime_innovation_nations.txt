Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"Mr. Secretary, Mr. Secretary, ambassadors, the future belongs to those who innovate. America and Israel are the prime innovation nations on the planet. AI is the thrust of innovation now and will create unbelievable things in the future. It's both challenging, because there could b bad things in it, but there could be unimaginable good things. I think we can lead this. This day will be remembered. Not every signing ceremony is as significant as this. This is very significant.
