Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem, met with French Foreign Minister Stephane Séjourné.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"First, I want to welcome you and thank you for the stalwart support, consistent support that France took against the savagery from day one, your position on the ICJ and this absurd accusation of genocide against Israel, and many other things, and also the effort to help with humanitarian medical assistance, and – of course – our cooperation on the question of Lebanon. We have a lot to talk about."

French Foreign Minister Séjourné:

"This meeting is important for us because we are at an important moment. You are familiar with France's positions, which have been consistent since you met with the President of the Republic, who has reiterated his words. France has very strongly condemned the events of October 7.

Together with the President of the National Assembly, a member of my party, we organized a very large, successful, demonstration against antisemitism."

Prime Minister Netanyahu asked Foreign Minister Séjourné to convey his great appreciation to President Macron.

Also participating in the meeting were the Prime Minister's Chief-of-Staff, the Director of the National Security Council, the Prime Minister's Foreign Policy Adviser and the French Ambassador to Israel.
