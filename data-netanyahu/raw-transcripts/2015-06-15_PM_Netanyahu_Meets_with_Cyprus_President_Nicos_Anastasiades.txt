Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today met with Cyprus President Nicos Anastasiades and told him at the start of their meeting:

"I used the word security because it is very concrete. It's not abstract. We have, we are suffering from terrorism in this region. A lot of this terrorism in the region and beyond the region is fomented by Iran that, along with its henchmen in Hezbollah, they operate a worldwide terrorism network of over 30 countries in five continents, and you and Cyprus have already suffered three terrorist plots, including the recent uncovering of an apartment with an enormous amount of ammonium nitrate, a very dangerous explosive.

So we are all, we have a common stake in battling this terrorism. I mention Iran because President Rouhani said the other day that Iran has had so far a great victory in the negotiations with the P5+1. If Iran wins, the world loses. And indeed, it's not too late. It's not too late to prevent Iran from having an agreement that paves its way to the bomb, that will give it immediately 40 to 50 billion dollars of cash for its terrorist networks and its aggression in the region, and ultimately hundreds of billions of dollars that it will use to, for its plans of aggression and conquest.

I believe that the P5+1 can get a better deal and certainly should have no deal if it's a bad deal, and this is a very bad deal. But given Iran's aggression in the region, given its terrorism in the Middle East, in our area and beyond, I think that the nuclear deal should be tied to, should tie the lifting of restrictions on Iran's nuclear program to a change in Iran's behavior and the lifting of sanctions to a different attitude on the part of Iran. I think this will be good for everyone in the Middle East. It'll be good for the world."
