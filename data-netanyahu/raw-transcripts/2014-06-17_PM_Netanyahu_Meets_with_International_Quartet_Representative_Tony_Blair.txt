Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today met with international Quartet Representative Tony Blair and told him at the start of their meeting:

"The brutal abduction of three Israeli teenagers shows the true face of Hamas (<>). It's not only committed to murdering Israelis, it's committed to kidnapping children. And I think the international community has to condemn Hamas for its terrorist activities and I think it has to support Israel's right of self-defense and I think it also must call on President Abbas to end his pact with Hamas. Anybody who supports peace must tell the Palestinian Authority that they cannot build a government that is backed by the kidnappers of children and the murderers of innocents."
