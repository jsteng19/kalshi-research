Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made the following remarks at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting:

"We are all shocked at the horrific massacre in Orlando. On behalf of the government and people of Israel, I would like to again express our condolences to the American people and the families at this especially difficult hour. This terror threatens the entire world and it is necessary – first of all – that the enlightened countries urgently unite to fight it. We stand shoulder to shoulder with the American people.

Today the Cabinet will be briefed on the recommendations of the Shtrum committee on the establishment of new banks. Competition in the banking sector will ease the credit situation for small and medium business. And separation between the major banks and credit card companies is the start of a comprehensive reform that will be good for all Israelis."
