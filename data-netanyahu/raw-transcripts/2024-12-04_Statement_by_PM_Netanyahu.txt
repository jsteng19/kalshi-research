Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening:

"The body of Itay Svirsky of blessed memory – who was taken hostage on 7 October 2023 at Kibbutz Be'eri and murdered in captivity by Hamas terrorists in January 2024 – has been recovered in a special operation.

The heart breaks at the heavy loss of the Svirsky family, which also lost Itay's parents, Orit and Rafi of blessed memory, who were murdered in Hamas's deadly attack.

Yesterday I met with ISA personnel and I would like to express deep appreciation to them and to the IDF, for their brave operation to recover Itay's body.

We will continue to take determined and relentless action to return all of our hostages, the living and the deceased."
