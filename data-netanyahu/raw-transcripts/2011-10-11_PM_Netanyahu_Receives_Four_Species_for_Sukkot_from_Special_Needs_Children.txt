Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today in his Jerusalem office, hosted special needs children, who gave him the four species (closed palm frond, citron, myrtle leaves and willow branches) ahead of the Sukkot holiday.

Zalman Cohen, a counselor from the Lend a Hand for a Special Child non-profit association, told Prime Minister Netanyahu that, "We are pleased to give you the four species, which symbolize the unity of the Jewish People. Today, the Jewish People are in need of victories over lies and wickedness and the way to do this is through unity. You moved us very much in your speech to the UN General Assembly in which you cited the Grand Rabbi of Lubavitch's statement that 'When you light a single candle of truth even the greatest lie is banished'."

Prime Minister Netanyahu thanked the children and said that, "I am very happy to meet you here today. You warm my heart and the hearts of the entire Jewish People. Happy Sukkot!"
