Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The two discussed the nuclear agreement with Iran, regional challenges and bilateral relations.

Prime Minister Netanyahu expressed his concern over the danger posed by the nuclear agreement and said that it would allow Iran to break out and arm itself with nuclear weapons within 10-15 years should it honor the agreement and within a shorter time if it violates the agreement. He added that the hundreds of billions of dollars that will flow into Iran would serve to arm the terrorist organizations that it operates in the Middle East and around the world.
