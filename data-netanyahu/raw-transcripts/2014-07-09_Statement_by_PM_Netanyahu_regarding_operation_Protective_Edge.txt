"Hamas and other terrorist groups in Gaza are firing rockets on cities throughout the State of Israel â€“ on Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Haifa, Beer Sheba, Sderot and other cities in Israel.

No country on earth would remain passive in the face of hundreds of rockets fired on its cities and Israel is no exception.

Today we expanded our operations against Hamas and the other terrorist groups in Gaza.

We will continue to protect our civilians against Hamas attacks on them.

Hamas, by contrast, is deliberately putting Palestinian civilians into harm's way.

It embeds its terrorists in hospitals, schools, mosques and apartment buildings throughout the Gaza Strip.

Hamas is thus committing a double war crime:It targets Israeli civilians, while hiding behind Palestinian civilians.

This operation could take time. We are resolved to defend our families and our homes.

Today I spoke with several world leaders. I appreciated their expressions of strong support for our right and our duty to defend ourselves, and this is what we will continue to do".
