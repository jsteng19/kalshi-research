Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today appointed former senior Mossad official Hagai Hadas as his special representative on the return of abducted IDF soldier Gilad Shalit. Hadas will be assisted by security establishment officials, Minister Dan Meridor and MK Yisrael Hasson; his work will be overseen by a special team composed of Defense Minister Ehud Barak, Foreign Minister Avigdor Liberman, Minister Yossi Peled, Minister Moshe Yaalon (and Minister Meridor and MK Hasson).

Hagai Hadas, 56, has held a variety of positions in the Mossad and is considered an outstanding intelligence and special operations man. He retired from the Mossad in January 2006, after holding a very senior position. He has since been involved in the establishment of an internet-based technological initiative.

He is married, with three children, and lives in the center of the country.
