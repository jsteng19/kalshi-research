Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this evening met with special envoy Ofer Dekel, who asked the Prime Minister to relieve him of his duties. Envoy Dekel had requested the meeting two weeks ago.

Envoy Dekel noted that he had served in his position for two and a half years and added that he had asked former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert – both orally and in writing – to relieve him of his duties but had acceded to the latter's request to serve until after he had left office.

Prime Minister Netanyahu expressed regret at Dekel's decision and at recent, partially erroneous reports. The Prime Minister expressed his deep appreciation for Dekel and his efforts. "Ofer Dekel devoted days and nights of his time to a mission of unparalleled importance, on a strictly voluntary basis and without any remuneration," he said.

During his term of service, Ofer Dekel successfully concluded the negotiations with Hezbollah and brought back to Israel the bodies of IDF soldiers Udi Goldwasser and Eldad Regev.

Prime Minister Netanyahu warmly thanked Dekel, on both his behalf and that of the Government, for his work and added that he intends to continue drawing on his vast experience and will consult with him on various issues related to his area of expertise..
