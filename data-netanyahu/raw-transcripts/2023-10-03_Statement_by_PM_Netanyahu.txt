Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today: "While Khamenei's terrorist regime exports ruin and destruction, Israel is advancing progress and peace. Just as Iran did not prevent us from achieving the Abraham Accords, neither will it prevent us from further expanding the circle of peace for the benefit of the citizens of Israel, the peoples of the region and all humanity."
