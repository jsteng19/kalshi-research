Following are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks today at the start of the Israeli-German joint Cabinet meeting:

"We are convening today, for the third time, a joint meeting of Israeli and German ministers. In the framework of this meeting, seven agreements were signed regarding bilateral socio-economic and cultural relations. We are allies, Israel and Germany, and we have a great desire, on both sides, to strengthen our relationship and our bilateral cooperation. We also have the strong desire to advance peace and security in our region;

and I spoke at length about several ideas in this regard. We know that we are in a very stormy and unstable period and we would like to advance stability, peace and security.

At today's meeting, ministers will present the issues they have discussed and the agreements they have reached in the areas of foreign relations and international aid, domestic security and dealing with emergency situations, science, economics, education and heritage preservation, environmental protection, transportation, agriculture and improving government services.

Since we would like to discuss all of these issues, we will need to be brief. To this end, I now conclude my remarks, knowing that we are advancing many issues that are important to both our countries and to the entire region."
