Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcomes the announcement of the Advisory Committee on Senior Appointments regarding the candidacy of Maj.-Gen. Aviv Kochavi to be the next IDF Chief-of-Staff.

The Prime Minister will submit the appointment for Cabinet approval at the Cabinet's next meeting, this Sunday, 25 November 2018.

The Advisory Committee on Senior Appointments chaired by retired Judge Eliezer Goldberg received Maj.-Gen. Kochavi's curriculum vitae and his answers to the questionnaire prepared by the committee. Maj.-Gen. Kochavi then appeared before the committee, which also received – in writing – then Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman's reasons for the choice.

Prime Minister Netanyahu, who is also serving as Defense Minister, informed the committee that he accepts the recommendation of former Defense Minister Liberman that Maj.-Gen. Kochavi be appointed the 22nd Chief-of-Staff of the IDF.

The committee also received the comments of IDF Chief-of-Staff Lt.-Gen. Gadi Eizenkot who signed his recommendation with the words: 'I am certain that Maj.-Gen. Aviv Kochavi will lead the IDF to new achievements as it meets current and future challenges. I warmly and wholeheartedly recommend him for the post of Chief-of-Staff.'

In order to examine the issues within its purview, the committee also issued a public announcement inviting all persons to contact it in writing, at the address listed in the announcement, and submit to it any facts which could, in their opinion, assist the committee in forming an opinion of the candidate.

Following its deliberations the committee reported that Maj.-Gen. Kochavi's integrity is completely unimpaired vis-a-vis the recommendation that he be appointed IDF Chief-of-Staff.
