Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Prime Minister's Office Director General Eli Groner, this morning, met with BlackBerry CEO John Chen, who has arrived in Israel on a 24-hour visit, and discussed with him BlackBerry's growth strategy in Israel.

Mr. Chen said that he views Israel as a central locale for implementing his company's development strategy â€“ technological acquisitions in the cyber and other spheres. BlackBerry recently acquired the Israeli firm WatchDox and turned it into a development center.

Prime Minister Netanyahu briefed BlackBerry CEO Chen on the development of the cyber industry in the State of Israel and emphasized that it is among the world's leaders. He added that since the start of 2015, Israeli cyber companies have raised approximately $250 million, or almost 20% of global investments in cyber. Mr. Chen was also briefed on the new program of grants to benefit cyber defense employers at the national cyber park in Be'er Sheva, which the Prime Minister invited him to visit.
