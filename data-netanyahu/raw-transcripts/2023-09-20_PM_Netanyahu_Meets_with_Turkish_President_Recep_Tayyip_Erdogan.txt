Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, at Turkish House in New York, met with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and told him that ties between the two countries were improving. The two leaders decided to continue advancing bilateral relations in trade, economic matters and energy. The leaders discussed regional and international issues, including normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia. Prime Minister Netanyahu thanked the Turkish President for the productive cooperation by their countries' security services, which thwarted the malicious intent of terrorist cells to attack Israeli targets in Istanbul, thereby saving lives. The two leaders extended reciprocal invitations to visit Israel and TÃ¼rkiye; it was agreed to coordinate the visits, which will take place soon.
