Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening:

"This week we freed two of our hostages in a brilliant military operation. As of now we have freed 112 of our hostages in a combination of strong military pressure and tough negotiations.

This is also the key to freeing more of our hostages: Strong military pressure and very tough negotiations.

Indeed, I insist that Hamas drop its delusional demands. When they do so, we will be able to move forward."
