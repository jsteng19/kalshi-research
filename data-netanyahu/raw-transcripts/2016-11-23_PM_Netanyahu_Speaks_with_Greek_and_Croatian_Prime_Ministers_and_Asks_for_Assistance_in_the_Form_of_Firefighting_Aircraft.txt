Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening, spoke with Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic and asked for humanitarian assistance in the form of firefighting aircraft. The Greek and Croatian Prime Ministers responded immediately and promised to send firefighting aircraft as soon as possible to assist in extinguishing the fires around the country; this is ahead of the strong winds forecast for tomorrow, which are liable to expand the fires.

At his visit earlier today to the forward command center for the wave of fires, adjacent to Zichron Yaakov, Prime Minister Netanyahu understood that there was a need for aircraft that could carry larger quantities of materials for extinguishing fires.
