Following are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks , today, at the start of the Government meeting:

"We are in a multi-front campaign against Iran's axis of evil, which is striving for our destruction.

This morning, the Houthis launched a surface-to-surface missile from Yemen at our territory. They should know that we exact a high price for any attempt to attack us.

Whoever needs a reminder of this, is invited to visit the port of Hodeidah.

Whoever attacks us will not evade our strike. Hamas is already learning this through our determined action, which will bring about its destruction and the release of all of our hostages.

I have visited the north.

I am attentive to the residents of the north. I speak with them and with the heads of local authorities in the north, I see their distress. I hear their anguish.

The current situation will not continue. This requires a change in the balance of forces on our northern border. We will do whatever is necessary to return our residents securely to their homes.

I am committed to this. The Government is committed to this and we will not suffice with less than this.

We will do this thanks to the heroism of our fighters and the unity among us, as a united people rising up against our enemies in order to ensure our future."
