Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this afternoon, met with a group of women from Women Wage Peace. Also participating in the meeting were the Prime Minister's envoy Isaac Molcho and, from Women Wage Peace, Judge (retired) Saviona Rotali, Amel Reihan Abu-Ramadan and Eilat Harel.

The women told Prime Minister Netanyahu about why their movement was established, following Operation Protective Edge, and asked him to initiate and lead a process for an agreement with the Palestinians. Women Wage Peace currently includes women from all sectors, political views and religions.

Prime Minister Netanyahu expressed his desire to return to the negotiating table and said, "I have no preconditions for negotiations. I am ready now to go to Ramallah or any other place in order to meet and hold direct negotiations without preconditions. We want to conduct negotiations with the Palestinians. The solution is two states for two peoples â€“ a demilitarized Palestinian state that recognizes the national state of the Jewish People. If you intend to meet with Abu Mazen, tell him that I am ready to meet if he is."
