Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this morning, made the following remarks prior to leaving for Moscow:

"We are leaving for a very important meeting with President Putin in Moscow. It is not correct that this is my first meeting with him since the Ilyushin plane was downed by Syrian forces because I met with him In Paris and we discussed that we would meet again and we are doing just that. Since then, of course, we have spoken by telephone several times including a few days ago.

The conversation will certainly deal with several issues, but from our point-of-view, the focus of the talks will be preventing Iran from entrenching in Syria, the entrenchment of a country which explicitly says that its goal is to wipe us out. You know that when I say we are acting against this, these are no empty words.

Of course, I will go into details with President Putin as we do in order to ensure that the Russian military and the IDF coordinate in such a manner so as to prevent friction and clashes between us. This has succeeded up until now and it is important that it also succeed in the future. This is the main goal for which I am traveling to Moscow; there are other goals."

In response to questions, the Prime Minister added: "I intend to realize all of the goals for which I am leaving for Moscow and we will return when they are achieved."

Prime Minister Netanyahu is being accompanied by Minister Zeev Elkin, National Security Council Director Meir Ben-Shabbat and GOC Intelligence Maj.-Gen. Tamir Heiman.
