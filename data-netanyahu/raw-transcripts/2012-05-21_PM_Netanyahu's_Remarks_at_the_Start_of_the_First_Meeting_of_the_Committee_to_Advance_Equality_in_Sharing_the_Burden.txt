Following are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks today, at the Knesset, at the start of the first meeting of the committee to advance equality in sharing the burden:

"Two weeks ago, we were in this room, Shaul Mofaz and I, to announce

the formation of the broad national unity government.

The first article in the unity agreement was to put forward an alternative to the Tal Law. Even before that, in January of this year, even before the High Court of Justice ruling, I told the Knesset that we would put forward a better and more just alternative to the Tal Law.

Today, I am honored to open the first meeting of the committee to advance equality in sharing the burden. Today, we will begin the discussions at the end of which we will pass a new law, a law on equality in sharing the burden. I believe that we must be guided by four main principles. First of all, an equal allocation of the burden. Second, gradual implementation. Third, it must include Jews and Arabs alike. Fourth, we must do all of this without setting public against public.

The committee to advance equality in sharing the burden will listen to many voices and there are many voices among the people. The committee is composed of both coalition faction representatives and outside representatives.

I would like to take this opportunity to invite representatives of all coalition factions to take part in the discussions. In the coming weeks, committee members will meet very often in order to formulate a more just solution for Israeli society. On behalf of us all, on behalf of the citizens of Israel, I wish you and us great success. Time is very short and the work is great. We must listen, discuss, propose and decide to legislate, all within a few weeks. We are ready for the mission."
