Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today made the following remarks following his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin:

"I am coming now from a very important and successful meeting with President Putin. I defined the goal as strengthening security coordination between Russia and Israel so as to avoid mishaps. During the meeting, it was agreed that GOC Air Force Maj.-Gen. Amir Eshel and my Military Secretary, Brig.-Gen. Eliezer Toledano, will hold a special meeting with the Russian Defense Minister and several other generals. They will meet and discuss – in a detailed and efficient manner – the coordination between our militaries and several other issues that have recently arisen. I think that this is vital because we must maintain freedom of action for the IDF and the air force in places that are important to us vis-à-vis our security, and I think that this was achieved. The second thing that was agreed at the meeting is the issue of pensions, which is a very painful and important issue for tens of thousands of Israelis who have no pensions. We agreed that this issue will be finally signed during my visit here to Moscow on June 7, when we mark 25 years of relations between our two countries. I think that these are two important achievements – one security and one social – and are a good gift for Passover. I am very pleased that I was able to rectify the pensions issue, and of course continue dealing with ongoing and important matters for Israel's security."
