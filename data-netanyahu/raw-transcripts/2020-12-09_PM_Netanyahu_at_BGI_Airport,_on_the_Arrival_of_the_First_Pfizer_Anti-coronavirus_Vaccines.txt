Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this morning, at Ben-Gurion International Airport, on the arrival of the first plane with Pfizer anti-coronavirus vaccines:

"I have been serving as Prime Minister of Israel for more than few years and this is one of the most moving moments that I have worked on very hard, for long months, with the Health Minister and the people of his ministry, in order to bring relief and a solution to the coronavirus pandemic.

Here you see the forklift lowering the first vaccines. We will bring millions of vaccines here for the citizens of Israel.

I had my eighth conversation last night with Pfizer Chairman and CEO Albert Bourla. I would like to thank him and his team.

We are here today on a great holiday for the State of Israel. We see the end. We still need to follow the rules regarding masks, hands and distancing, but the end is in sight. What is important to me is that millions of Israelis be vaccinated.

I believe in this vaccine. I expect that it will receive the appropriate permits in the coming days and I want the citizens of Israel to be vaccinated. In order to do this, I want to serve as an example for them and I intend to be the first in the State of Israel to be vaccinated with this vaccine.

I am certain that many of you will also do so. We see the light at the end of the pandemic. This is a holiday for Israel."

The Prime Minister added:

"I would like to direct your attention to the sun that is shining, a beautiful sunny day in every sense. It is not self-evident that the State of Israel, a country with nine million inhabitants, receives the vaccines at the same time as the leading countries of the world. Now we will see to it that they reach our amazing logistical storage center, which is a few minutes from here, with refrigeration and the highest medical standards in the world. We are setting out. Thank you very much."
