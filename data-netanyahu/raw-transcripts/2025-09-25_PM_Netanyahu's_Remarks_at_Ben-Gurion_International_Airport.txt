Prime Minister Netanyahu, this morning , at Ben-Gurion International Airport, prior to departing on a diplomatic visit to the US, where he will address the UN General Assembly and meet with US President Donald Trump:

"I am now leaving, with my wife, for the UN General Assembly (UNGA) and Washington. At the UN, I will tell our truth – citizens of Israel, the truth of IDF soldiers, of our state.

I will condemn those leaders who, instead of condemning the murderers, rapists and burners of children, want to give them a state in the heart of Israel. This will not happen.

In Washington, I will meet – for the fourth time – with President Trump and I will discuss with him the great opportunities our victories have brought, and our need to complete the war objectives: To return all of our hostages, to defeat Hamas and to expand the circle of peace that has occurred for us in the wake of our historic victory in Operation Rising Lion and the other victories that we have achieved.

This is also the opportunity to wish you, citizens of Israel and the entire Jewish People, a happy New Year, a year of security, prosperity and peace."
