Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today in his Tel Aviv office, made the following remarks at a ceremony in which he received a basket of first fruits for Shavuot from children from communities in the Jordan Valley:"The problem of the infiltrators must be solved and we will solve it.

We will complete construction of the fence within a few months and we will soon begin repatriating infiltrators back to their countries of origin.

However, I would like to make it clear that there is no place for either the expressions or the actions that we witnessed last night. I say this to public officials as well as to the residents of south Tel Aviv whose pain I understand.

We will solve the problem and we will do so responsibly.‚Äù
