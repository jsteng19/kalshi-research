Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the Government of Israel and the people of Israel express their deep sorrow over the tragedy in which Polish President Lech Kaczynski, his wife, senior members of the Polish government, army and all of the members of the Polish delegation lost their lives.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said: "We share in the profound grief of the Polish people over the loss of President Kaczynski, his wife and all of the members of the Polish delegation. I knew President Kaczynski as a Polish patriot, as a great friend of Israel and as a leader who was very active on behalf of his people and for advancing peace and prosperity in the world. We recently met in Warsaw, in January of this year, within the framework of the events commemorating 65 years since the liberation of the Auschwitz camp and International Holocaust Day. President Kaczynski led an important process for opening a new page in relations between the Polish and Jewish people and developed Polish-Israeli relations. During this painful hour we bow our heads, together with all of the citizens of Israel, over the huge loss to the Polish people and to all nations that seek freedom and peace".
