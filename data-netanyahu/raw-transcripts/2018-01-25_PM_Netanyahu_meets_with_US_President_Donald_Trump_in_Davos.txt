"Mr. President, I want to say something, because this is the first meeting we've had since your historic decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital and to move the embassy and now to expedite the movement of the embassy to Jerusalem.

And I want to say that this is a historic decision that will be forever etched in the hearts of our people for generations to come. People say that this pushes peace backward. I say it pushes peace forward, because it recognizes history, it recognizes the present reality. And peace can only be built on the basis of truth. By recognizing history, you've made history. And we will always remember that.

We also support you completely and your stalwart position on the Iran nuclear deal. You've said it's a disastrous deal. You've said that if its fatal flaws are not fixed, that you should walk away from it. And I want you to know that if you decide to do that, then we will back you all the way.

We also appreciate the fact that you confront Iran's aggression with us and with other parties in the region as never before. I've never seen the realistic alliance between the United States, Israel and your other allies in the region as strong, as unified, as it is under your leadership.

And the last point is that you stood up for Israel at the UN in a remarkable way, rock-solid support. This is a place, it's a house of slander against Israel and against the United States, and by word and deed, you have told them, enough is enough.

As you finish your first year in office, I want to say that I look forward to continuing our remarkable, tremendous friendship in the years ahead, and I want to express the appreciation of the people of Israel to you. Thank you, Mr. President."
