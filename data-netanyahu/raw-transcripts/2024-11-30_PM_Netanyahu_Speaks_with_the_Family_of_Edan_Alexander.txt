Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening, spoke with the family of Edan Alexander, who is being held hostage in Gaza by the Hamas terrorist organization. This is in the wake of the cruel psychological warfare publication of a video in which a sign of life was received from Edan. Prime Minister Netanyahu said, in the conversation, that he feels the suffering that Edan – and the hostages and their families – are enduring, and promised that Israel is determined to take every action to bring them back home, together with all of the hostages held by the enemy.
