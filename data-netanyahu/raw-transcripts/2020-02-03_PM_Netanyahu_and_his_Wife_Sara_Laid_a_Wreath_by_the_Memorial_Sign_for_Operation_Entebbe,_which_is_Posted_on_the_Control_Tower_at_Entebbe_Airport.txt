Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara, today, laid a wreath near the memorial sign for Operation Entebbe, which is posted on the control tower at Entebbe Airport. Prime Minister Netanyahu by the memorial sign: "This is the fifth time that I am standing in this place, a few meters from where my brother Yoni fell. This always causes waves of emotion, of longing and of pride. When my wife and I came here with our two sons on one of the visits, President Museveni arranged a memorial ceremony here for the soldier who fell, which was truly incredibly moving. Afterwards in the tent on the side, I asked him â€“ it was unusual to establish here a memorial to a foreign unit that entered by force, and also took the lives of many Ugandan soldiers. He said: 'I want you to understand the significance of the operation. We fought Idi Amin, who slaughtered 500,000 Ugandans. We were in the jungle and we heard about the raid on Entebbe and we understood then that it is possible to defeat evil.' And this is what the memorial behind me says, that with courage, strength of spirit and heroism, it is possible to overcome any evil. I think that this is what Entebbe symbolizes and this is what, to a large degree, symbolized Yoni's life and death." Prime Minister Netanyahu and his wife then took their leave from the Ugandan Prime Minister and his wife. Prime Minister Netanyahu thanked them for the visit and the warm welcome.
