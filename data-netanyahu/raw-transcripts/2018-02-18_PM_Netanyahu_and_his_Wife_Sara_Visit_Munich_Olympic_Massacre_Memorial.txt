Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara, in Munich, accompanied by Bavarian State Minister for Education, Science and the Arts, Dr. Ludwig Spaenle, visited the memorial to the eleven athletes who were murdered during the 1972 Munich Olympics.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"There is special meaning to the fact that we are standing at the place where 11 of our athletes were murdered just because they were Jews and Israelis. Millions were slaughtered here just because they were Jews.

The great difference is that we have a state and this state has acted, and is acting today, against terrorism and those who would destroy us.

Because of this we are here to represent our proud state which ensures the future of our people.

I would like to request all members of the delegation and anyone who would like to join in to sing Hatikvah."
