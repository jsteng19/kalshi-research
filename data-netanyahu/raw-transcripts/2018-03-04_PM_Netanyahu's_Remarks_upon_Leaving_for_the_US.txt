Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made the following remarks prior to boarding his plane to the US

"This is a very important visit. I will meet with a very great friend of Israel, and my personal friend, US President Donald Trump. First of all, I will thank him for the historic decision to move the US Embassy to Jerusalem on Independence Day. This is a very big present for our country.

I intend to discuss with him a series of issues but first Iran â€“ its aggression, its nuclear aspirations, and its aggressive actions in the Middle East in general and on our borders, all of them, in particular. I think that the need to rebuff this aggression is a common goal for us and for nearby countries in the region, but first of all it is ours, that of all Israelis.

I am going there on behalf of all citizens of Israel, as I understand it, to achieve three goals: Security, peace and economic prosperity for all citizens of Israel, for our country."
