Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem, issued the following statement:

"I send my deepest condolences to the families of the victims of the recent terrorist attacks in Brussels.

We’re in a global war against terror. And last night I spoke with Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel and a few hours ago with the European foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini. I offered Israel’s assistance in our common battle against terrorism.

I think the point of departure in the battle against terrorism is this: Nothing justifies terrorism – absolutely nothing.

In Paris or Brussels or San Bernardino or Tel Aviv or Jerusalem – terror must be condemned equally and it must be fought equally.

Israel stands ready to cooperate with all the nations in this great struggle.

These terrorists seek our destruction. They will fail. But if we work together they will fail a lot sooner."
