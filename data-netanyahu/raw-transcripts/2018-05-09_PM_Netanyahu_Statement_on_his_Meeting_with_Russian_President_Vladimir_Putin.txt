PM Netanyahu issued the following statement about his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin:

"I have just finished almost ten hours in the company of President Putin. We attended very moving events â€“ the parade marking the victory over the Nazis and other events, and of course there were also good and useful talks.

In these talks I presented our perspective on issues including Iran's secret nuclear archive and, of course, the current tension.

I presented Israel's obligation and right to defend itself against Iranian aggression, from Syrian territory. The Iranians declare their intention to attack us. They are trying to transfer forces and deadly weapons there with the explicit goal of attacking the State of Israel as part of their strategy to destroy the State of Israel.

I told President Putin that it is the right of every state, certainly it is Israel's right, to take such steps as are necessary to defend itself against this aggression. I think that matters were presented in a direct and forthright manner, and this is important. These matters are very important to Israel's security at all times and especially at this time."
