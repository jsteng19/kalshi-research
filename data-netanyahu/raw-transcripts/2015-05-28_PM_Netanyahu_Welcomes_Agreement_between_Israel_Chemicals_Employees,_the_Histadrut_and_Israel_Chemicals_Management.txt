Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcomes the agreement between Israel Chemicals employees, the Histadrut [labor federation] and Israel Chemicals management. "The Government has set for itself the goals of continuing to develop the Negev, to maintain high employment and to create new jobs. Employment is the most social thing there is. Just this week it was announced that the unemployment rate in Israel is less than 5%. We must see to it that this trend continues, in the Negev and throughout the country," the Prime Minister said.
