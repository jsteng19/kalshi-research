Following are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks upon his return from the US this morning:

"After my short visit to the United States, I return to Israel knowing that many around the world heard what Israel has to say about the impending deal with Iran. In my speech before the Congress, I presented a practical alternative, which would impose tougher restrictions on Iran's nuclear program, extending Iran's breakout time by years. I also called on the P5+1 to insist on a deal that would link the lifting of those restrictions to Iran's ceasing its sponsorship of terrorism around the world, its aggression against its neighbors and its calls for Israel's destruction. I heard encouraging responses from both Democrats and Republicans. They understood that the current proposal would lead to a bad deal and that the alternative is a better deal. Happy Purim."
