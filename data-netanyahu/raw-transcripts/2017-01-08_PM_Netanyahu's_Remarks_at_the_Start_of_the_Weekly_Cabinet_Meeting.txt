Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting, made the following remarks:

"Today we will approve the Government plan to develop the north. The approximately NIS 10 billion plan meets many needs. It promotes jobs, education, health, small businesses, cutting-edge industry, infrastructures and tourism. On a very large scale we are doing here we did in the south. Just as we saw to the south and shot it forward, so today we are seeing to the north and pushing it forward. I would like to thank my colleagues, Periphery, Galilee and Negev Minister, and Interior Minister, Aryeh Deri, and Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon, and their people, and also Eli Groner, for the hard work on this issue.

At the same time, today we will approve the expansion of the medicines basket by hundreds of millions of shekels. Many life-saving medicines and new technologies that many people have hoped for will be included in this basket of medicines. Additionally, we are expanding dental care from age 14 to age 15. It keeps climbing and the hand is still extended."

Prime Minister Netanyahu added:

"We are only a few days away from the Paris Conference and only a few days after the Security Council discussion. We are making a very great effort to prevent another Security Council resolution. Again, I would like to welcome the sweeping, bipartisan support in the American Congress against the anti-Israeli resolution that was adopted by the UN and against other similar resolutions. Of course, this is one effort, but not the only effort that we are making in order to prevent bad resolutions against Israel at the UN. I also tell you that we will act in accordance with the Congress's decision, either to repeal the UNSC resolution or to change it so that it does not damage Israel."
