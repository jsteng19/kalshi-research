Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, made the following remarks upon leaving for Berlin:

"I am now leaving on an important visit to Europe. I will meet with three leaders and I will raise two issues there: Iran and Iran.

First of all, there is the need to continue the pressure on Iran against its nuclear program. I believe that this pressure should be increased. It could be that there is not full agreement on this at the moment, but in my opinion, such an understanding will take shape.

The second issue is blocking Iran's aggression in the region, especially its attempts to establish a military presence against us in Syria and attack us from there. On this issue I hope to form an agreed-upon policy.

These are meetings with three very important leaders in Europe. I think that it is a good thing that I have a very personal, close and very good connection with them. This is important for the State of Israel.

We will also mark 70 years of friendly relations between Israel and France in very many areas – culture, trade, tourism and – of course – innovation. For this we will have a special event with President Macron."
