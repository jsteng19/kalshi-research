Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today met with Bank of Israel Governor Prof. Stanley Fischer and received from him

the Bank of Israel 2010 Annual Report

BOI Gov. Fischer said that the report summarizes an excellent year for the economy and praised the Government for maintaining the budgetary framework. He noted that unemployment dropped markedly in 2010 and added that higher growth – than when the budget was prepared – is now expected for 2011.

Prime Minister Netanyahu thanked BOI Gov. Fischer for preparing the report and said that, "The data on the economy's achievements are very good but we are continuing our constant search for growth engines for the economy. The State of Israel has great potential for growth. The impediments in the Israeli economy are also our opportunity. Growth engines are in the plans that we are advancing in the housing market, in continuing to integrate Arabs and the ultra-orthodox in the labor market and in the continuation of competitive taxation policies."
