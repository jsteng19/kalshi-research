Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, over the weekend, spoke with Czech Republic Prime Minister Petr Necas and thanked him for

his country's courageous UN vote against the Palestinian Authority's request

Prime Minister Netanyahu agreed with his Czech counterpart that he would stop in Prague this Wednesday – en route to his planned visit to Germany – and personally thank him for standing up for the truth and for peace.

"The history of Israel and the Czech Republic has taught us that one must cling to the truth even if the majority is not with you. Your vote must serve as an example for all those who support peace, which can be achieved only via direct negotiations without preconditions. The Palestinian Authority's decision to go to the UN constitutes a fundamental violation of the agreements with Israel and only pushes peace further away," Prime Minister Netanyahu said.
