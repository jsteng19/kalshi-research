Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem, convened the subcommittee on advancing the fight against crime in the Arab sector in Israel.

The Project Director reviewed the progress in establishing an oversight mechanism for the transfer of funds to the local authorities. A briefing was also given on the pace of progress regarding the package of expedited legislation for advancing the fight against crime in the Arab sector. Prime Minister Netanyahu requested that the matter be expedited; the Justice Minister replied that the work could be completed by the upcoming opening of the Knesset session. The Project Director and the Finance and Justice ministries will consider advancing additional laws to wage a significant economic struggle against the criminals and criminal organizations. The Prime Minister believes that one of the more effective ways to deal with the violence is with significant economic tools in order to increase the economic chokehold on the criminal organizations.

Prime Minister Netanyahu was briefed on the protection rackets and the serious harm to business owners. He asked the Project Director to examine the possibility of cooperation with the Economy, Finance and Justice ministries in order to provide indemnification and insurance to businesses that have been victimized by the protection rackets.
