Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem, met with Ford Motor Company Executive Chairman William Clay Ford, Jr. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: "Israel has finally got an automotive industry. We tried, when I was a young officer, we had cars, Israeli-made, fiberglass cars. I leaned on one and my elbow went right through. We have now an autonomous vehicle industry and everything else that you see. And that’s just changing transportation." William Clay Ford, Jr.: "It will continue to change because it’s not autonomous vehicles, it’s all the things that it will enable, all the content that will go into it, and you will be ground zero for all of that. It’s great."
