Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this morning made the following remarks at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting:

"Last week, missiles were fired at Eilat from Sinai. Those responsible, apparently, were members of a terrorist cell that left Gaza and used Sinai in order to attack an Israeli city. This is unacceptable. We will exact a price for this; this has been our consistent policy for the past four years and it will serve us here as well. I request that Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon present a short briefing on the issue.

In recent days, another issue has been brought to my attention regarding the distribution of drugs to children and young people in our cities, and to all people via various special stores. We are not prepared to accept this. I telephoned Public Security Minister Yitzhak Aharonovitch and I asked him to act. He has already raided some of these stores, he will brief us, but we apparently need to deal with several aspects â€“ legal, health and others; therefore, I ask to form a special task force led by Minister Aharonovitch, along with Health Minister Yael German, who suggested the idea and I accepted it. I think that this idea is correct. Interior Minister Gideon Saar, Justice Minister Tzipi Livni and Economy Minister Naftali Bennett, all of these are involved and I expect to receive a proposal within 30 days. We will clean- up our streets from drugs destined for children.

Thank you very much."
