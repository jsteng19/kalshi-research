Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with Farhan al-Qadi, who was rescued from being held hostage by Hamas in Gaza.

The Prime Minister congratulated al-Qadi and told him that the entire people of Israel was moved by his being freed.

Prime Minister Netanyahu made it clear that he would continue to do everything to return all of our hostages home.

Prime Minister Netanyahu also issued the following statement [translated from Hebrew]:

"Welcome home Farhan Qadi.

I commend the IDF and the ISA for another successful rescue operation. We are working relentlessly to return all of our hostages.

We are doing this in two main ways: Negotiations and rescue operations. The two of these together require our military presence on the ground, and constant military pressure.

We will continue to act until we return all of them home."

"And your children shall return to their own border" (Jeremiah 31:16)
