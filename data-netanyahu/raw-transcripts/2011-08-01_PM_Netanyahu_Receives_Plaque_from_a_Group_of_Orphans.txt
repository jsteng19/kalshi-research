Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today at the Knesset, met with a group of orphans and their families and received from them a plaque in appreciation for the recent passage of the 2011 Orphans Law, according to which support payments will be given to orphaned children who lost both parents in hostile attacks.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said that, "We have no possibility of repairing the terrible injustice or filling the empty space that grows ever wider. But perhaps we can offer some small consolation. The important thing is that the people of Israel support you and would like to console you."
