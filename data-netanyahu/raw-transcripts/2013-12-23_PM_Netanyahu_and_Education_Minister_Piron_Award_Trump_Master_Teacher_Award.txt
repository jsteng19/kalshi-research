Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Education Minister Shai Piron, at a festive ceremony held in the former's office, awarded the 2013 Trump Master Teacher Award to Koby Schwartzbord, a physics teacher at the Leo Beck High School in Haifa. The NIW 100,000 prize was awarded by Prime Minister Netanyahu, Education Minister Piron and Trump Foundation Executive Director Eli Hurvitz. Honorable mentions were awarded to Iris Kahane, a mathematics teacher at Sharrett High School in Netanya and Danny Ovadia, a physics teacher at Misgav High School in northern Israel.

Prime Minister Netanyahu commended the winners and said, "You found the way to capture your pupils' attention from close up and far away and I am certain that you will also instil in them the idea of excellence. Two things – interest and excellence – are the key to success. I would like to thank you for succeeding."

Education Minister Piron said, "Our mission is to create an educational system with meaningful learning in which there is very deep dialogue. Teachers are people who also create thinking, also inspire and also give impetus for action and responsibility. Together we will work to develop excellence and put Israel among the top countries in mathematics and science on the one hand and in literature, history and the Tanakh on the other. I would like to thank the Trump Foundation for its outstanding work in both improving teaching and in focusing on sciences and mathematics."

Koby Schwartzbord said, "I very much love teaching. I relate to each pupil personally, teach through experience and try to pupils my great love for the profession. We are also undertaking very many activities, especially a trip to see the particle accelerator. We also take photographs and investigate physical phenomena, etc."
