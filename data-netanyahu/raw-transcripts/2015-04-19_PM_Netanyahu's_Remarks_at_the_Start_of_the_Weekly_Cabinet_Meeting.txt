Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made the following remarks at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting:

"Israel views with utmost gravity the supply of S-300 missiles from Russia to Iran, especially at a time when Iran is stepping up its

aggression in the region and around the borders of the State of Israel.

Israel also views with utmost gravity the fact that there is no reference to this aggression in the agreement being made between the major powers and Iran. There is no stipulation that this aggression be halted, whether at the start of the agreement or as a condition for the lifting of sanctions. Yesterday we saw the military parade in Tehran and Iran's exhibition of weapons to the world.

Every year the missiles are bigger and enhanced â€“ in accuracy, strength and deadliness; however, one thing does not change. What does not change is the inscription 'Death to Israel' on the missiles. Against the threats that I have described, Israel will do whatever is necessary to defend the security of the state and its citizens."
