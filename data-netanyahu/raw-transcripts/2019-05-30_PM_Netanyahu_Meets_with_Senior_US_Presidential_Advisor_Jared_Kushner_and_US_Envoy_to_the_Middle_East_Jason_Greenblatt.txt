Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met today at the Prime Minister's Residence in Jerusalem with senior US Presidential advisor Jared Kushner and US envoy to the Middle East Jason Greenblatt. Also attending the meeting were US Special Representative for Iran Brian Hook and Israeli Ambassador to the US Ron Dermer. Prime Minister Netanyahu: "It’s always a great pleasure to welcome Jared Kushner and Jason Greenblatt to Israel, to Jerusalem, and to discuss our common efforts for prosperity, security and peace. I’m tremendously encouraged by how the United States, under President Trump, is working to bring allies together in this region against common challenges, but also to seize common opportunities. And, you know, we had a little event last night. That’s not going to stop us. We’re going to continue working together. We had a great, productive meeting, which reaffirms that the alliance between the United States of America and Israel has never been stronger, and it’s going to get even stronger." Jared Kushner: "I want to thank Prime Minister Netanyahu for his gracious hospitality. I send greetings from President Trump for you and for all people of Israel. This was my first time in Israel since the President recognized the Golan Heights, which was a very important announcement. The security of Israel is something that’s critical to the relations between America and Israel, and also very important to the President, and we appreciate all your efforts to strengthen the relationship between our two countries. It’s never been stronger, and we’re very excited about all the potential that lies ahead for Israel, for the relationship, and for the future."
