This is an historic day for the United States of America and for all the countries engaged in the battle against terrorism. I want to congratulate President Obama and the American people. I want to congratulate America’s soldiers, and its intelligence personnel for a truly outstanding achievement. It took ten years to track Osama bin Laden down. It took ten years to bring a measure of justice to his victims. But the battle against terrorism is long and relentless and resolute. This is a day of victory – a victory for justice, for freedom and for our common civilization.
