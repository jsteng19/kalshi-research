Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening, released the following statement:

"I was heartbroken and appalled by the murderous attack on a Pittsburgh synagogue today.

The entire people of Israel grieve with the families of the dead. We stand together with the Jewish community of Pittsburgh. We stand together with the American people in the face of this horrendous anti-Semitic brutality.

And we all pray for the speedy recovery of the wounded."
