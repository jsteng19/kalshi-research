Following is an excerpt of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks, today, at the President's Residence, at the ceremony honoring outstanding ISA personnel:

"You, Mr. President, defined them [ISA personnel], and rightly so, as one of the best domestic security services in the world. May I disagree? The best. One of the reasons for this is that there is also cooperation. Many of the barriers and walls of the past, and rivalries between the organizations, and between the security services, between IDF Intelligence and the ISA, have disappeared completely, as if they never existed. This is a significant force multiplier for the State of Israel.

In recent decades, we have turned Israel into a global power; I can say a rising global power – a regional power, and security, intelligence and economic power. However, we have also turned it onto something more – the leader in the fight against terrorism. The ISA greatly contributes to this.

Thanks to you, we can overcome terrorism. Thanks to you we can also defeat terrorism. Defeating does not mean uprooting; it has accompanied us for over 100 years, but we are always ahead of the curve, always pre-empting.

The ISA is also technology, modus operandi and methods; however, above all it is spirit – the spirit of people, of men and women, of creativity, persistence, daring and, I would say, of great commitment, true commitment to the mission of defending the State of Israel and its citizens.

I would like to thank each and every one of you and – of course – your families. I think that the citizens of Israel cannot begin to comprehend, not even a little, how many Israeli lives you have saved. People walk in the streets and are unaware that they do so thanks to you, but I am aware, and I offer you heartfelt thanks on behalf of all citizens of Israel."
