At the start of the meeting, Prime Minister Netanyahu said, “I asked for this meeting because I am committed to the Ethiopian immigrant public. One of the things that I cannot tolerate is displays of racism. I was shocked about this. On the other hand, I was pleased to see the good things that we are doing. This past Sunday, I met with a group of Ethiopian women. This was an extraordinary and moving event. There are also practical plans, which we would like your assistance with, to help the community. The best way to do this is through dialogue. The goal is to hear from you directly on how we can move forward. There will be several more such meetings.”

During the meeting, the Ethiopian community representatives were briefed on Government activities on the issue: The five-year plan to improve absorption of Ethiopian immigrants, including assistance in schools to boost achievements; promoting higher education and preventing drop-outs; employment assistance and efforts to assist Ethiopian soldiers in the IDF; the historic effort to bring the Falashmura to Israel and the decision to accelerate their arrival; grants to assist in finding housing for those leaving absorption centers; the national Ethiopian project, including the establishment of youth centers; various plans to cooperate with the non-profit associations that are active among the Ethiopian community and the move to memorialize those who perished in Sudan
