Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made the following remarks at the start of his meeting with Serbian President Tomislav Nikolic:

"Today we struck at one of those involved in the criminal firing of rockets at Eilat. I said that we would not ignore this; our action is in continuation of our policy. We will not accept the sporadic firing of rockets from either the Gaza Strip or Sinai. We will act, and are acting, in order to defend Israeli citizens. I would also like to express my condolences and those of the entire country to the family of Evyatar Borovsky. The terrorist who perpetrated the murder has been captured and we will continue to act on this front as well in order to defend our citizens."
