Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening in Beijing, met with the incoming and outgoing chairmen of the China Development Bank, Chen Yuan and Hu Huaibang, respectively.

Prime Minister Netanyahu and the bank leaders discussed the creation of partnerships with Israeli companies and ways to jointly finance business initiatives in China, Israel and Africa. The Prime Minister noted Israeli innovation and knowledge in – inter alia – water desalination, wastewater treatment, energy, transportation and health. He proposed that the Chinese bank open a branch in Israel in order to realize the potential of cooperation with Israeli companies.

The China Development Bank is considered a main and important tool in China's diplomatic relations and works to advance Chinese government policy. Its source of income is the sale of bonds in local and international markets.
