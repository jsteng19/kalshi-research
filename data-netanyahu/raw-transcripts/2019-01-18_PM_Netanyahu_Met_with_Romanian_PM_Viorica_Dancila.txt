Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem, met with Romanian Prime Minister Viorica Dancila and told her at the start of their meeting:

"This is a wonderful opportunity to see you again. The relations between Israel and Romania are fantastic and they will be made even stronger by our visit.

I hope that you will act to stop the bad resolutions against Israel in the EU, and also of course to move your embassy and other embassies to Jerusalem. We wait for you in Jerusalem."

Prime Minister Netanyahu and Romanian Prime Minister Dancila discussed strengthening bilateral cooperation in various areas. They also discussed Iran's aggression in the region and its efforts to entrench itself militarily in Syria. Prime Minister Netanyahu said that Israel, in its actions against terrorism, is defending not only itself but Europe as well.
