Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this afternoon convened a discussion on the issue of progress in the process of repatriating illegal work infiltrators to their countries of origin. Hagai Hadas, who is responsible for repatriating infiltrators to their countries of origin in Africa, reviewed the progress that has been made on the issue.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said at the start of the discussion:

"We have succeeded in blocking the entry of infiltrators from Africa to Israel. After having faced the threat of the entry of hundreds of thousands, this month, not one infiltrator entered Israel's cities. We have been achieving this result for several months and next month we will complete the construction of the fence along the border with Sinai. Now we are moving on to the second stage, that of repatriating the infiltrators who are already here.

I have appointed Hagai Hadas as my special representative. He is holding contacts with various African governments and our goal is to repatriate tens of thousands of infiltrators who are in Israel to their countries of origin.

Just as the blocking was possible, so too the repatriation is possible and we will achieve this goal."
