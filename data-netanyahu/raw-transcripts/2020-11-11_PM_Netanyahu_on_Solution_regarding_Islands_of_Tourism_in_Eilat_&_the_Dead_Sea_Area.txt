Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: "I would like to congratulate Health Minister Yuli Edelstein, Knesset Constitution, Law and Justice Committee Chairman Yaakov Asher and Minister David Amsalem who I asked to meet and resolve the issue of the islands of tourism in Eilat and the Dead Sea area. These are isolated islands according to our health rules for maintaining the lives and health of the citizens of Israel. I think that an excellent solution has been found and I would like to thank you and tell you that not only the residents of Eilat and the Dead Sea area but all citizens of Israel are congratulating you."
