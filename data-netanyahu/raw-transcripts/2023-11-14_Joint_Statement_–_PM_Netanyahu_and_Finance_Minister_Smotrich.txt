The Prime Minister, the Finance Minister and the Finance Ministry representatives indicated that reducing bureaucracy and impediments are an important goal in the war budget and set as a goal the independence of the local councils in managing the budget with emphasis on the councils adjacent to the northern and southern confrontation lines. Prime Minister Netanyahu and Finance Minister Smotrich agreed that immediately following the formulation of the final budget by the professional echelon, the budget will be submitted to the Government and the Knesset as soon as possible, with work on the 2024 budget beginning immediately afterward.
