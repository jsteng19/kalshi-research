Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the site of the terrorist attack near Hebron, together with Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, IDF Chief-of-Staff Lt.-Gen. Herzi Halevi and ISA Director Ronen Bar. The Prime Minister was briefed by various officials on the murderous attack that took place this morning and also received an intelligence update on the area, especially Iranian efforts in the region and the intensive operational activity of the security forces in Judea and Samaria. Prime Minister Netanyahu : "First, I would like to send my condolences to Batsheva's family, may G-d avenge her, a devoted mother of three children who was killed in such a brutal manner near Hebron today. I would also like to send my best wishes for recovery to the man who was wounded; we are all praying for his wellbeing. We are in the midst of a terrorist assault encouraged, directed and financed by Iran and its proxies. We are working around the clock, all commanders and all soldiers, to apprehend both the murderers and those who try to murder Israeli citizens. As of today, we have caught them all and we will catch these as well. It must be understood that a considerable portion of this terrorist wave comes as a result of outside guidance. We are using means, and we will use yet more, both offensive and defensive, to settle accounts with the murderers and those who dispatch them, near and far. I would like to give full backing to the commanders and soldiers who are working day and night to protect the residents in order to protect us all, and we must all back them." Also participating in the visit were the Prime Minister's Chief of Staff, the Prime Minister's Military Secretary, the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories, the Head of IDF Central Command, the Commander of the IDF Judea and Samaria Division, the IDF Spokesperson, the IDF Judea Brigade Commander and additional officials.
