Following are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks at the start of the Cabinet meeting today:

Regarding events in the south, the IDF is taking strong action against those who are attacking us

and it will take even stronger action if need be. Our policy is to use force in order to restore security and quiet to the residents of the south.

Tomorrow, another plane will leave for South Sudan. Two additional planes will leave next week. I note that in the wake of

our decision a few weeks ago

, any infiltrator who sits on the border and waits for a bus to take him to Tel Aviv will now be taken to years of detention. This is already making itself felt.

At the same time, we are completing 190 kilometers of fence this week. The section around Eilat, which we thought would take more time, is being built quickly. Therefore, the combination of these things, including fines and punishments for those who employ illegal infiltrators, I think has begun to reverse the trend, and we will solve this problem.

Thank you."
