Following is an excerpt from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s remarks, this morning, at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting: “Over the weekend we heard Nasrallah’s remarks on his attack plans. It should be clear that if Hezbollah dares to foolishly attack Israel, we will hit him and Lebanon with a crushing military blow. As opposed to Nasrallah, I do not intend to detail our plans. It is enough to recall that Nasrallah had – for years – dug terrorist tunnels, which we destroyed within days.”
