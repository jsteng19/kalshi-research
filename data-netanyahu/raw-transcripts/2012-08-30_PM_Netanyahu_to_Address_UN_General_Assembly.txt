Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has decided to address the UN General Assembly next month in New York. He will take off for New York after Yom Kippur (on Thursday, 27 September) and leave New York early Sunday morning, 30 September.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said, "In Tehran today, the representatives of 120 countries heard a blood libel against the State of Israel and were silent. This silence must stop. Therefore, I will go to the UN General Assembly and, in a clear voice, tell the nations of the world the truth about Iran's terrorist regime, which constitutes the greatest threat to world peace."
