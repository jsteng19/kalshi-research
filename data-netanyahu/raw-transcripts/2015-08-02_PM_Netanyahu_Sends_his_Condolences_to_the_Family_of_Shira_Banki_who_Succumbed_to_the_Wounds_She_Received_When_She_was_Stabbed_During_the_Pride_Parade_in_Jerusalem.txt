Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sends his condolences to the family of Shira Banki, who succumbed to the wounds she received when she was stabbed during the Pride Parade in Jerusalem. "Shira was murdered because she courageously supported the principle according to which everyone is entitled to live their lives in dignity and safety.

We will not allow the abhorrent murderer to undermine the fundamental values upon which Israeli society is based. We strongly condemn the attempt to instill hatred and violence in our midst and we will deal with the murderer to the fullest extent of the law," the Prime Minister said.
