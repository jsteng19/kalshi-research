Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made the following remarks at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting this afternoon:

"A few hours ago, I held a consultation to assess the situation in the Jerusalem District of the Israel Police. I met with two officers there – Nir, who carried an elderly man on his back, and Noam, who drove a woman to the delivery room. They represent the many thousands in the government agencies, and among the public, who are working for the fourth night in a row in the face of this great storm.

Thanks to the determination of the security and rescue forces, and to the cooperation among citizens, many lives have been saved. The State of Israel is coping very well with the great storm. I believe that we performed better than advanced countries that are hit by such storms more frequently, or countries that suffer such storms, and we see the results with us. I can say that we are pleased, first of all, that we achieved the main goal – saving lives. This is what has guided us from start to finish and will continue to guide us because it is still not over."
