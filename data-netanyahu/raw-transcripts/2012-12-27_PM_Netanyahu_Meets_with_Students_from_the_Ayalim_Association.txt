Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening, in the Old City of Be'er Sheva, met with students from the Ayalim association. At the start of the meeting, the Prime Minister referred to a statistic published today according to which for the first time since 2006 not a single illegal work infiltrator entered Israel from Egypt in the past week:

"The flood of infiltrators, which began in 2005, increased and increased. From dozens, we reached a situation in which there were thousands of infiltrators a month; in the end, there would have been hundreds of thousands of illegal work infiltrators here. In order to ensure that we would control the southern border, I decided that we would build a fence from the Gaza Strip to Eilat. This month, the number of infiltrators who crossed the border and reached Israel's cities declined to zero."
