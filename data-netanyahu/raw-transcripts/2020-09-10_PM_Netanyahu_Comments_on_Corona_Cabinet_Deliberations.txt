Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening: "Prof. Gamzu and the hospital directors came to the Corona Cabinet today and waved the red flag. They said that even though the number of severe cases in Israel is still relatively low, this could change in an instant and the hospitals will then be unable to treat them and there will be many severe cases and many deaths. They said that action must be taken â€“ but we need to take action sagaciously and not recklessly; therefore, this takes many hours and, on the other hand, we must make a decision early enough so that we will all be able to get organized for the holidays, for Yom Kippur, and of course for Rosh Hashanah. I believe that a solution will be found that will stop the morbidity and allow us to emerge from the restrictions gradually and responsibly."
