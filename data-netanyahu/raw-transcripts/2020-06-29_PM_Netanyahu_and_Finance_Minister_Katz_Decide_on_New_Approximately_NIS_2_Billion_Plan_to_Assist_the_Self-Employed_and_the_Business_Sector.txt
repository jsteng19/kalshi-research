Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Finance Minister Yisrael Katz, today, decided on a new approximately NIS 2 billion plan to assist the self-employed and the business sector, which will be put into effect in the coming days. The plan includes special grants of up to NIS 400,000 for businesses that were hurt by up to at least 60% in May-June, for up to 10-15% of turnover, with turnover of up to NIS 20 million. It was also decided to expand the circle of businesses that will receive the assistance, to businesses the turnover of which is up to NIS 100 million and which were hurt by up to at least 80% in these months. Self-employed with turnovers of NIS 300,000 per annum will also receive an additional monetary grant, double that which they received in the phrase phase. Also, the criteria for receiving advances will be changed from 20% to 40% relative to the previous phase. It was also decided to continue giving higher grants to businesses that kept workers despite the crisis. The plan currently being put forward by the Prime Minister and the Finance Minister is part of a comprehensive policy for managing the crisis. Alongside the acceleration of the economy, independent wage-earners and businesses that need assistance will receive an appropriate response. The plan is designed to facilitate the immediate channeling of significant funds to the self-employed and the business sector, without delays and unnecessary impediments, thereby enabling them to weather the crisis. The foregoing is in addition to the allocation of NIS 7,500 grants for every employee who is returned to work. Concomitantly, the state budget and a comprehensive arrangements law will be submitted soon. The latter will provide for competition vis-Ã -vis the major monopolies and for reforms to remove impediments and regulation, and which will assist economic activity and lead to renewed economic growth.
