Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening: "I have just come from the IDF operational command center in the Kirya; it is very impressive. With every passing day we are striking at more of the terrorist organizations' capabilities, targeting more senior commanders, toppling more terrorist buildings and hitting more weaponry stockpiles. Just as I told the ambassadors here today, this is the natural right of Israel. I very much appreciate the support of these governments, and I especially appreciate the support of our friend US President Joe Biden, for the State of Israel's right to self-defense. I am determined to continue this operation until its objective is achieved: to restore quiet and security to you, citizens of Israel."
