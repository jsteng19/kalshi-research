Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, at the Tesla Motors plant in Fremont, California, held a live conversation with Tesla Motors CEO and entrepreneur Elon Musk. The two discussed the development of artificial intelligence and its implications for the future, which Prime Minister Netanyahu defined as "the blessing and curse" of our time. He noted that he appreciates Musk's commitment to freedom of expression and his opposition to antisemitism. Following the conversation, there was an expanded discussion with the participation of Open AI President Greg Brockman and MIT Professor Max Tegmark. Among the issues raised were the implications of artificial intelligence for the labor market of the future, including negative implications and how to prevent them. Prime Minister Netanyahu said that he would like the State of Israel to be among the leaders in the field. Prime Minister Netanyahu in his conversation with Elon Musk: "It took us maybe a century to adapt to the industrial revolution. We may have just about a few years, and then we're running out as we speak, to adapt to the AI revolution. The first thing you can do is get like-minded states to agree on a code of ethics and a code of conduct and that's pretty easy. We can do it among our countries, in our countries and between our countries. We can cooperate to ensure the blessings and curb the curses as much as we can. We do that in civil aviation; we do it in other things, too. I appreciate the opportunity to pick your brain on something that is so important for the future of my country and the future of the world."
