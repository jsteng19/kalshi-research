Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today appointed Uzi Dayan as Chairman of the Mifal Hapayis Board of Directors (the position has been vacant since September 2007).

In order to choose the best possible candidate for the post, Prime Minister Netanyahu decided to establish a search committee chaired by Prime Minister's Office Director-General Eyal Gabai. The other members were Prof. Ben-Zion Zilberfarb, Public security Ministry Director-General Yaakov Ganot and PMO Senior Deputy Legal Adviser Yael Cohen.

The search committee set a series of criteria. Over 100 candidates applied to the committee. Committee members met with 21 candidates and delivered a short list of final candidates – including Uzi Dayan – to Prime Minister Netanyahu.

Uzi Dayan has broad public and administrative experience, mainly due to his career service in IDF, during which he served – inter alia – as GOC Planning, GOC Central Command and Deputy Chief-of-Staff. He also served as head of the National Security Council in the PMO. Dayan has also been involved in various social, public and community initiatives.
