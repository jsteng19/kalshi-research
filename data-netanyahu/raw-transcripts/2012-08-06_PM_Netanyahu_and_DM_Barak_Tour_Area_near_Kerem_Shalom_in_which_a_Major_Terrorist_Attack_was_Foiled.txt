Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Ehud Barak, today toured the area in which a major terrorist attack was foiled last night. They were briefed by GOC Southern Command Maj.-Gen. Tal Russo and ISA Director Yoram Cohen.

Prime Minister Netanyahu met with commanders and soldiers who were involved in the operation and, next to the APC that was hit, said: "I would like to praise the IDF and ISA for foiling a very major terrorist attack. You deployed and acted properly. I would also like to express regret over the killing of the Egyptian soldiers. I think that it is clear that Israel and Egypt have a common interest in maintaining a quiet border. However, as has been made clear on numerous occasions, when it comes to the security of the citizens of Israel, the State of Israel must and can rely only on itself. Nobody can fulfill this role other than the IDF and the security services of the State of Israel and this is how we will continue to act."
