Ahead of Remembrance Day for the Fallen of Israel's Wars, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara, today , in Jerusalem, met with IDF orphans and a bereaved brother from the IDF Widows and Orphans Organization. During the emotional meeting, each child told about his father and the memories that they have.

The widow of Lt.-Col Muhammad Kheir El-Din, who was killed during a special operation in Khan Yunis in 2018, said that at first it was difficult for her son to hear the word 'orphan' but today he looks forward to going to meetings that help him greatly. Prime Minister Netanyahu told her boys, Ahmed and Ram: "Your father was a great hero. It is a great privilege to be the sons of a great hero. Not everyone can say this. I say it to you as someone who is not only familiar with the operation in which he fell but also with other things that I cannot share just yet. This should accompany you throughout your lives – your father was a genuine hero. This is a great privilege, even with the very great pain."

Iris, the widow of Lt. Shmulik Halfon, who fell in battle during the Second Lebanon War in 2006, said that her son Liad had been interviewed in the past and asked: "What do you miss?" and he had answered: "How can I miss him if I didn't know him?" Sara Netanyahu told Liad that he carried his father's genes and that he was a part of him. She added behind each name of a fallen soldier, there was a family, whose stories helped them in getting to know a little about each family.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"It happens that frequently I send men into battle or on very dangerous missions and not even once do I send them there without thinking about you – the families that will pay the price afterward. It does not prevent me from doing this but it means that when you do so, you always think about the price and do not do so lightly."

Sara Netanyahu:

"The Prime Minister has always told me, since the 1990s, 'I do not want any mother to feel what my mother went through and I do not want any wife to go through this' not over her husband, or a child or a brother. Whoever goes through this, and it is so strong in him, thinks about these things. Then you know that there is someone here who thinks about you and worries about you."

IDF Widows and Orphans Organization CEO Shlomi Nahumson:

"I would like to thank you for this important event, beyond that it strengthens each one of the families here, it is also a very important message. In the end, many decisions are made around the Prime Minister's desk, decisions that sometimes touch on human lives. The statement that you bear not just the consequences of operations, more and less successful, but also the implications those wars have on human lives, on the families of those soldiers that you sometimes send into battle by virtue of your authority, this reflects values of the highest order. For this statement and this meeting, we would like to thank you this year as well."

Also attending the meeting were IDF Widows and Orphans Organization Chairwoman Tami Shelach, IDF Widows and Orphans Organization CEO Shlomi Nahumson, the organization's Project Manager for Youth Programs, Iyar Eliyahu and the Prime Minister's Military Secretary, Maj.-Gen. Avi Gil.
