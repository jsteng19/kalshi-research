[Transcription]I return to Israel knowing that Israel's concerns regarding the impending deal with Iran are better understood.That the deal currently on the table is deeply flawed.Instead of preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons this impending deal will facilitate that development.The alternative to that bad deal is not war but a much better deal.I proposed in Washington placing two new parameters on any deal with Iran.First, place tougher restrictions on Iran's nuclear program, extending its breakout time to the bomb in years. Second, I called for only lifting those restrictions only when Iran ceases promoting terrorism, ends its aggression against its neighbors, and stops threatening to destroy the State of Israel.I believe these proposals constitute a practical alternative to what is currently on the table. Thank you.
