Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"Prime Minister, it's a delight to welcome you. Georgia and Israel have had very warm relations. Our connections go back 2,500 years, perhaps even 2,600 years, to the Jewish community in Georgia. We have many, many Jews who came from Georgia as a living bridge. I myself had the opportunity to visit Georgia.

I know that we can bring our relations to even greater heights, and I welcome this opportunity to do this on your visit."
