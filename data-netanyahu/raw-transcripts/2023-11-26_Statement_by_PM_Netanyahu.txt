Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening: "We brought back another group of hostages this evening – women and children, and we are moved from the depths of our hearts, the entire nation, when we see this reuniting of families. It simply stirs the soul. I have just spoken with President Biden with great emotion, also over the little Avigail, of course. What a joy it is to see her with us, But, on the other hand, how sad it is that she is returning to a reality in which she has no parents. She has no parents – but she has an entire nation that embraces her and we will take care of all her needs. Beyond this, I would like to say that there is also an outline that says that it is possible to release an additional ten [hostages] each day. That would be welcome. At the same time, I also told President Biden that at the end of the outline, we will go to realizing our goals with full force: Eliminating Hamas, ensuring that Gaza will not go back to being what it was and – of course – releasing all of our hostages. After having been in Gaza today, where I met with our brave and heroic soldiers, reservists and conscripts, with fire in their eyes, I am convinced that we will succeed in this mission – because we have no other choice."
