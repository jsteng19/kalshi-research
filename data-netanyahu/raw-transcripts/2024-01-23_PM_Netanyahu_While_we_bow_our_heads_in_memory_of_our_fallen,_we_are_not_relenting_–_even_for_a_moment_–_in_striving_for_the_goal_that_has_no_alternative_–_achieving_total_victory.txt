Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and Minister Benny Gantz, today, at Ramat Korazim, issued statements at the start of the meeting between the members of the War Cabinet and northern local and regional council heads.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"Yesterday was one of the most difficult days since the outbreak of the war. We lost 24 of our best heroic sons who fell in defense of the homeland. Together with the citizens of Israel, I grieve for each one of them. I embrace the families, whose lives have changed forever. From here we send from here prayers for the well-being of our wounded. The IDF is carrying out a thorough inquiry into the tragedy; we must learn the lessons and do everything for the well-being of our soldiers.

We are in the midst of a war, the justification of which is without parallel. In this war there have been great achievements, including today, in completing the encirclement of Khan Yunis, but there have also been very heavy costs.

While we bow our heads in memory of our fallen, we are not relenting – even for a moment – in striving for the goal that has no alternative – achieving total victory. Together we will fight – and together we will win."
