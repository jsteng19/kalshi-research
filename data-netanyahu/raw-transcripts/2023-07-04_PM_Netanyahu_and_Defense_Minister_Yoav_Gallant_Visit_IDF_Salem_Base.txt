Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, this afternoon, visited the IDF Salem base, near Jenin.

Prime Minister Netanyahu visited the Salem Crossing near the entrance to Jenin and was updated on the current situation on the ground by the Head of IDF Central Command, Maj.-Gen. Yehuda Fuchs and Menashe Brigade Commander Col. Arik Moyal. The senior commanders briefed the Prime Minister on offensive and defensive efforts in Jenin, the operational achievements up to now and the future deployment of forces. They also detailed the threat from IEDs and the activity of our forces to destroy the laboratories for the production of explosives, as well as the arrests of terrorists.

Prime Minister Netanyahu at the conclusion of the visit [translated from Hebrew]:

"Today, there was a heinous terrorist attack in Tel Aviv that was stopped due to the intervention of an armed civilian. Without this intervention, this terrorist attack could have claimed many lives. I wish the wounded a swift recovery.

Whoever thinks that such an attack will deter us from continuing our fight against terrorism is mistaken. He is simply unfamiliar with the spirit of the State of Israel, our government, our citizens and our soldiers.

We will continue as long as necessary to uproot terrorism. We will not allow Jenin to go back to being a city of refuge for terrorism. We will eradicate terrorism wherever we see it and we will strike at it."
