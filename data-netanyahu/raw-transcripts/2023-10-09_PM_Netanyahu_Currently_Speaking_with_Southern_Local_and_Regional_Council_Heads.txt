Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is currently speaking with southern local and regional council heads.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"We are in the midst of a campaign. I know that you have undergone a difficult and terrible ordeal. What Hamas will experience will be difficult and terrible; we are already in the campaign and we are just getting started. Your leadership has been very strong in these difficult days. The state will leave no stone unturned to help all of you. I ask that you stand steadfast because we are going to change the Middle East. I embrace you and the residents. We are all with you and we will defeat them forcefully."
