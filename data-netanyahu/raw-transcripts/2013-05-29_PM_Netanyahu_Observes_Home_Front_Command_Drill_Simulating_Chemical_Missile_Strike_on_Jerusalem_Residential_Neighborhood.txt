Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu observed an IDF Home Front Command drill that simulated a chemical missile strike on a Jerusalem residential neighborhood, in the framework of national emergency week, and made the following remarks:

"What we are seeing here today is designed to defend Israel against a cluster of new threats. These threats are accumulation around us. We are in a changing reality and in order to meet changing threats, we are investing great effort and are holding many drills. We are working with experience, wisdom and great responsibility in preparing for the worst.

In order to do this we will yet need resources and laws, and we will need to decide on something simple â€“ that life takes precedence over everything. We will do what it takes, in both organization and in legislation, in order to defend Israel's citizens. It is possible to defend, it will not always be perfect, the protection will never be hermetic, but it is possible to defend Israel's citizens. This is what today's drill is about and this is what we will continue to do in the months and years ahead.

You have seen this deployment and the lessons that have been drawn. This is the fruit of a combined effort by the IDF Home Front Command, the Home Front Protection Ministry, the Prime Minister's Office, other ministries, municipalities and the Union of Local Authorities. You saw this during Operation Pillar of Defense."
