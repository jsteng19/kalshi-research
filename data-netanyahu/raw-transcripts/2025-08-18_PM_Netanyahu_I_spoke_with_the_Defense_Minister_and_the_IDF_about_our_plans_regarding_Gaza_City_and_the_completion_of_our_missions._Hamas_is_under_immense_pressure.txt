Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today:

"Today I visited the Gaza Division where I met with the IDF senior command staff.

Citizens of Israel, I would like to tell you three things:

First, I expressed – on your behalf, that of the Government of Israel and for myself – deepest appreciation for the great achievements of the IDF in the War of Redemption, the war on seven fronts.

Second, I was impressed by the fighting spirit and determination to complete the defeat of Hamas and the release of all of our hostages.

Third, I spoke with the Defense Minister and the IDF about our plans regarding Gaza City and the completion of our missions.

And like you, I hear the reports in the media, and from them you can be impressed by one thing – Hamas is under immense pressure."
