Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, visited an IDF Intelligence base where he received an intelligence briefing by the Head of IDF Intelligence, Maj.-Gen. Shlomi Binder and the commander of Unit 8200, Brig.-Gen. Yossi Sariel.

The Prime Minister thanked the soldiers and intelligence officers for their vital contribution to the security of the State of Israel.

Prime Minister Netanyahu [translated from Hebrew]:

"I have just finished visiting one of our intelligence bases. I must say that I am deeply impressed by the work that is being done and I am no less impressed by the work that you will do. We will continue striking Hezbollah.

I say to the people of Lebanon: Our war is not with you. Our war is with Hezbollah. Nasrallah is leading you to the edge of the abyss. I told you yesterday to evacuate homes in which there is a missile in the living room and a rocket in the garage. Whoever has a missile in the living room and a rocket in the garage will no longer have a home.

But I tell you something else. He is putting your country in danger. Free yourselves from Hezbollah's grip. Free yourselves from Nasrallah's grip, for your own good."

The Prime Minister was accompanied by his Chief-of-Staff Tzachi Braverman, his Military Secretary Maj.-Gen. Roman Gofman and his Spokesperson, Dr. Omer Dostri.
