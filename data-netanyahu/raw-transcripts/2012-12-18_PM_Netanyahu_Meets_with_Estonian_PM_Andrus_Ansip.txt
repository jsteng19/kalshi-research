Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with Estonian Prime Minister Andrus Ansip and made the following remarks at the start of their meeting:

"It's good to welcome you here in Jerusalem and to strengthen the relationship and friendship between Estonia and Israel. During the height of the Cold War, the defining line was those who championed freedom and those who opposed it. Today in the Middle East we have a defining line â€“ those who want freedom and moderation and those who want to advance repression and medievalism. And I think that it's very clear that Israel stands in the frontline of those who want progress and freedom. Unfortunately, we see the other forces, led by Iran, trying to make their way and to seize control of areas throughout the Middle East. We see that in their support for Syria, Hezbollah, and Hamas; we see them increasingly here, in Palestinian territories in Judea and Samaria. This creates, I think, a partnership of all those who want to assure the advance of progress, modernity and peace, and it is in this context, in addition to our own bilateral relations, that I welcome you here in Jerusalem."
