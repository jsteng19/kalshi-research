Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening addressed an event marking 40 years since the establishment of the Israel Police Anti-Terrorist Unit. Following is an excerpt from his remarks: "I would like to send condolences to the family of Steven Sotloff who was murdered by ISIS in an act of appalling brutality. Steven was murdered because for the terrorists he was a symbol of the West â€“ the same culture that extremist Islam wants to eradicate. Extremist Islam sees Israel, the US and the free world as partners in liberal democracy, which it would like to see gone from the world. I think that there is the beginning of a certain waking up and today many people around the world understand better than in the past that the threats to Israel are the same threats to them and that whoever does not nip these threats in the bud will, in the end, find them in their own house."

Prime Minister Netanyahu also spoke to the commanders of anti-terrorist units from other countries who had come for this evening's event and told them that we are all fighting the same war. To the personnel of Israel's Anti-Terrorist Unit, the Prime Minister said, "I know that we can count on you. On behalf of all Israelis, thank you."
