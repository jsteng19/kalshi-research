Prime Minister Netanyahu and his wife Sara, at the Prime Minister's Residence in Jerusalem, hosted a dinner for Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis and his wife Mareva.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"This is a wonderful opportunity to welcome you and your wife, Mareva, into our home, and your son Konstantin. We had excellent discussions today, and we're advancing, I would say, three pipelines. First, the gas pipeline. Second, the electricity pipeline â€“ it's a connector between Israel, Cyprus and Greece. And third, the tourist pipeline.

We hope to be able to reestablish flights. We said August 1st is a target date. It depends on the corona. Right now it's rising. We hope to control it and bring it down. But we really would like to see Israelis coming to Greece, Greeks coming to Israel.

I'm glad that you and your family and your delegation came to visit us. It's wonderful to see you again. This is a great friendship."
