Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the framework of his conversations with local mayors, spoke with Ashkelon Mayor Itamar Shimoni, Ashdod Mayor Yechiel Lasri and Rishon LeTzion Mayor Dov Tzur, and told them: "I commend the way in which you are running your cities at this time, as well as the discipline of your residents. We will continue to conduct this campaign until the goal is achieved. We will apply as much force as may be necessary in order to restore quiet to Israel's citizens. The IDF and the ISA have many achievements on the battlefield both in attacking the terrorists and in protecting Israel's citizens. I ask the public to continue listening to the instructions of IDF Home Front Command because this is one of the ways to prevent Hamas from achieving its goals. At this time, it is especially important to show responsibility and unity. We are much stronger when we are united."

Prime Minister Netanyahu added that, on behalf of Israel's citizens, he would like to convey his condolences to the family of Dror Hanin, who lost his life in our continuing fight against terrorism.
