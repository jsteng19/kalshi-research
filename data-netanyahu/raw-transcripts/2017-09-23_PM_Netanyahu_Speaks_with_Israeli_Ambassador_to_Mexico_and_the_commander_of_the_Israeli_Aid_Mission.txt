Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a short time ago today, spoke by telephone with Israeli Ambassador to Mexico Yoni Peled and with the commander of the Israeli aid mission, Col. Dudi Mizrachi, who updated the Prime Minister on the Israeli mission's search and rescue operations which it is carrying out as part of the main search and rescue efforts.

Prime Minister Netanyahu told them: "Happy New Year to you. What you are doing is a mitzvah. You are shining Israel's light in the world, a big light. It is important from a humanitarian standpoint and also to show the world the true Israel. You are making the State of Israel very proud. Be blessed and return home safely! Happy New Year and may you be inscribed for good."
