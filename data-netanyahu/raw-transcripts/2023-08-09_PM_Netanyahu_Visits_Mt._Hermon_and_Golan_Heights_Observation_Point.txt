Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara, today , visited Mt. Hermon and viewed the Golan Heights. They also met with the IDF Nahal Brigade soldiers who are serving there for a short conversation over coffee.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"This stirs up a lot of emotions in me, first of all of nostalgia. As a soldier and commander, I was here a lot many years ago, on many operations, mainly in the snow. It is pleasant to be here in the sunshine and see the wonderful development of the Golan Heights, which we all have worked on, to see our soldiers who gave me some coffee, and really to know that we are walking on land that will be under Israeli sovereignty forever. This was not self-evident a few decades ago when I served here. Today it is understood by everyone – and this is important. Additionally, I like to show my wife that I was young once and jumped on the hilltops."

In the Artillery Corps 405th Battalion guestbook, Prime Minister Netanyahu wrote:

"I stand with you in your important mission – safeguarding Mt. Hermon and each other."

Sara Netanyahu wrote to the soldiers' and commanders' partners:

"Continue to be strong and supportive because you are the strength of your soldiers, friends and partners, and you will raise the children to love the land and people – like their fathers." She signed the guestbook [translated from Hebrew]: "Bravo! With love, Sara Netanyahu."
