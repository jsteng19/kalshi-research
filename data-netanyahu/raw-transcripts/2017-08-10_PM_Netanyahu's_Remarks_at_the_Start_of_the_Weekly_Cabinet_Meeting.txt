Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this morning at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting, made the following remarks:

"I am leaving today on an historic visit to Latin America. This will be the first time since the establishment of the State of Israel that a sitting Prime Minister will have visited South America and Central America. I will be visiting Argentina, Colombia and Mexico, and I will also meet with the President of Paraguay.

In Argentina and Mexico, I will be joined by delegations from Israeli companies in order to develop reciprocal economic relations between the countries. We are, in effect, doing what we are doing in Asia, Africa, Australia, Eastern Europe, the eastern Mediterranean basin and around the world. This visit will strengthen our economic, security and technological ties with Latin America and it constitutes a continuation of the strengthening of Israel's international position, a systematic process that we are successfully leading.

As you know, Mexico experienced a severe earthquake over the weekend. Israel sends condolences to the families of the victims. We understand that these are difficult days for this country, for the Mexican people. In my talks with the President of Mexico, we will offer aid in reconstruction or any other assistance that we can give. I will then leave for the US and I will address the UN General Assembly. Our great friend the US is also currently dealing with severe natural disasters and we all hope that it will pass the coming storm in peace.

Today the Cabinet will be briefed by the director of the Israel Security Agency. Israelis are not aware of everything the ISA does, In July and August, the ISA thwarted over 70 terrorist cells that were planning attacks against Israeli soldiers and civilians. I would like to express deep gratitude to the ISA personnel and to all those involved in this important work on behalf of the security of Israel."
