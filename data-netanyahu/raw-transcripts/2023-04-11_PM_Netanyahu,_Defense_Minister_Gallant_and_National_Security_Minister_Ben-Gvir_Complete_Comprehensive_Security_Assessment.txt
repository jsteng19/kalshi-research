Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, this afternoon, completed a comprehensive assessment with the heads of the security services on the security situation in Israel, including Judea and Samaria, Jerusalem and the Temple Mount.

Prime Minister Netanyahu and the ministers directed that all of the operational forces necessary be invested in order to protect worshippers going to the Western Wall and the routes leading to it.

It was also decided to prohibit Jewish visitors and tourists from going up to the Temple Mount until the end of Ramadan on the unanimous recommendation of the Defense Minister, the IDF Chief-of-Staff, the Director of the ISA and the Israel Police Inspector General.

Prime Minister Netanyahu commended the Israel Police for the way it has operated on the Temple Mount and at the Western Wall during Passover, and the security forces for their many counterterrorist operations and actions to protect the citizens of Israel, which saved many lives.
