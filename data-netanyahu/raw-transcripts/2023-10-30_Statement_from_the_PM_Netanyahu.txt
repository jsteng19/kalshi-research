Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening:

"Last night, our forces liberated Pvt. Ori Megidish from Hamas captivity. Ori was abducted on the black morning of October 7th. Welcome home Ori!

I commend the ISA and the IDF for this important and moving achievement, which expresses our commitment to bring about the release of all the hostages. The entire people of Israel salute the ISA and the IDF.

To the terrorists of Hamas and ISIS I say â€“ you are monsters. We will continue to pursue you. We will continue to hunt you. We will strike you until you fall at our feet."
