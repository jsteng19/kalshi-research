Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed his sorrow on the passing of former minister and MK Shoshana Arbeli-Almozlino:

"Shoshana Arbeli-Almozlino was a pioneer among women. She had Zionist faith and an abiding commitment to the State of Israel. These values found expression in her public service, from Zionist activity in Iraq to positions as minister in various Israeli governments. May her memory be blessed."
