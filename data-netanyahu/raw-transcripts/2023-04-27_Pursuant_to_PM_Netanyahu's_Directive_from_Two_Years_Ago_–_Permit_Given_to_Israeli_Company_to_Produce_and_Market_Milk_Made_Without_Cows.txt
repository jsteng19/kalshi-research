Pursuant to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's directive from two years ago, to advance on developing alternative proteins in Israel, a permit was given today, to an Israeli company to produce and market products made of alternative proteins using pioneering food-tech technology in which milk is made without cows. The permit was issued by the Prime Minister's Office in cooperation with the Health Ministry, the Science Ministry and the Innovation Authority.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"I am pleased to declare that for the first time in Israel it will be possible to produce and market milk proteins that are not from cows. This permit is an initial breakthrough and a genuine milestone in an area in which the State of Israel is a technological leader.

The development of this technology will lead to the economic strengthening of Israel, food security, better dealing with climate change and the welfare of animals."

Last week (Wednesday, 19 April), during his visit to Steakholder Foods, Prime Minister Netanyahu declared that Israel would soon grant a permit to an Israeli company to produce and market milk that is not from cows.

Staff work currently being carried out under the aegis of Prime Minister's Office Director General Yossi Shelley will be submitted soon for government approval. The team that has been working on the government decision is made up of representatives from the Prime Minister's Office, the Health Ministry, the Science Ministry and the Innovation Authority.
