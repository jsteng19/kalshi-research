Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Ehud Barak, IDF Chief-of-Staff Lt.-Gen. Benny Gantz and GOC Air Force Maj.-Gen. Amir Eshel visited the Palmahim Air Force Base.

The Prime Minister met with pilots who took part in the attacks in the Gaza Strip and said, "You carried out the missions that were defined for you in a precise manner. If the quiet is maintained â€“ you will be able to continue preparing for the next campaign.

If the quiet is violated, you will go back and hit what's left. During the precise operation, Hamas's arsenals were hit very hard. In the IDF's precise operation, most of the missiles aimed at the center of the country were destroyed, as were thousands of missiles aimed at the south of the country. As soon as the operation achieved its goals, there was no reason to continue it. We chose when it began and we controlled how it ended. If the quiet continues, it will be met with quiet. If it is violated, we will respond strongly.

I salute the reservists for their determination to be mobilized for the security of the state. It is very likely that we will need you in the future."
