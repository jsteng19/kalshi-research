Prime Minister Netanyahu spoke with the chief rabbis of Israel, Rabbi Yitzhak Yosef and Rabbi David Lau.

The rabbis noted that they had issued a joint call to adhere to the Health Ministry rules and that prayers should – as much as possible – be held outdoors and should be short.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"I would like to reiterate what you have said to the public: To strictly follow the rules, wear masks, maintain social distancing and pray in open areas as much as possible. Whoever does enter a synagogue should be extra careful regarding the Health Ministry rules."

The Prime Minister added that he appreciates the rabbis' efforts to help prevent the spread of the pandemic.
