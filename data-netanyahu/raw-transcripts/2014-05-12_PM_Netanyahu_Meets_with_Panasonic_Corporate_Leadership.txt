Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today in Tokyo, met with Panasonic corporate leaders including Chairman of the Board Shusaku Nagae, Tokyo Center Director Yoshiko Hamazaki, Marketing and Sales Manager Hiroki Miyaji and International Relations Director Genichiro Shimada.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said, "There is one area that transcends everything and affects everything and this is the question of cyber security. All the systems that I saw here are computerized systems; they're all vulnerable. Cyber security is a growing need and a central need for your businesses. This is something Israel is developing by leaps and bounds on a global scale and we are open to participation not only with governments, but also with companies. And indeed the biggest companies in the world in this field and related fields are now coming to Israel to invest in cyber security and we invite you to do the same.
