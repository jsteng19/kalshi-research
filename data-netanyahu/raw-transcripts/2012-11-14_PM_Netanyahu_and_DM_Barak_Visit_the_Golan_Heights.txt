Prime Minister Netanyahu said, "I came today with Defense Minister Barak, IDF Deputy Chief-of-Staff Maj.-Gen. Naveh, and GOC Northern Command Maj.-Gen. Golan in order to closely observe the deployment and actions of the IDF vis-a-vis the new challenges coming from Syria. There are two immediate challenges: One is the firing at our forces and our territory and the second is the attempt to infiltrate. I am impressed that the IDF is operating well in order to meet these challenges. A new reality is affecting the government in Syria: New forces are emerging from the cracks in the Syrian regime and forces – affiliated with Global Jihad – that are even more hostile to Israel are becoming established. We are also preparing to deal with this".

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Ehud Barak, visited the Golan Heights, viewed the point that IDF returned fire to and were briefed by IDF Deputy Chief-of-Staff Maj.-Gen. Yair Naveh and GOC Northern Command Maj.-Gen. Yair Golan.
