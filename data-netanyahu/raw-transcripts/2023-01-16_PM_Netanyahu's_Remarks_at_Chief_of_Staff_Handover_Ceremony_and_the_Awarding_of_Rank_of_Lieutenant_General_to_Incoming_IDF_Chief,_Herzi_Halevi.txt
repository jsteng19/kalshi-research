Minister of Defense Yoav Galant and all government ministers;Speaker of the Knesset and distinguished rabbis;Outgoing Chief of the General Staff, Lt.-Gen. Aviv Kochavi;Incoming Chief of the General Staff, Lt.-Gen. Herzi Halevi;Members of the General Staff, former senior IDF officers, the Kochavi family, the Halevi family, bereaved families, distinguished guests,Every commander in the IDF needs a rational mind, an attentive heart and strong, firm shoulders. Your shoulders have special power: they bear the responsibility for the defense of the State of Israel, and you wear the rank insignia, which represents the hierarchy of authority down the chain of command, on them.

In this ceremony, where we place the lieutenant general insignia on the shoulders of the incoming chief of general staff, we all remember the great privilege of standing shoulder-to-shoulder and shouldering the burden of our mission, to ensure the existence and future of the State of Israel.

Aviv, today you conclude more than 40 years of dedicated service in the IDF. Last weekend, yesterday and today, we met to summarize your achievements. I thanked you for your service, your efforts, your accomplishments and your contribution to the IDF and to Israel's security over these years, and of course, over the past four years, during which you held the position of chief of the general staff of the IDF. Your long journey, which began in the paratroopers boot camp at Sanur, now comes to an end; a series of points that come together to make one line: a sweat-drenched shirt, dusty shoes, exhausting treks – day and night, stretcher on your shoulder, finger on the trigger, patrols, ambushes, raids, fighting the enemy. All this prepared you for the past four years as commander of the IDF.

Four years ago, we stood here as you took the reins of the IDF, and I said that if we were willing to defend our country with all our might, it was possible that an all-out war would not be necessary. But if it was, the IDF would overcome the challenge, and the citizens of Israel would overcome the challenge, united and unified in the difficult times. Together, we would guarantee our survival.

This message is relevant today. And I repeat it, not to "copy-paste" my speech, but because this is what I have always believed.

We must exhibit steadfast determination to overcome the threats we face, especially those from Iran and its terror proxies. That is what we have done for the past decade, including during the four years during which you, Aviv, commanded the IDF as Chief of General Staff, and that is what we will continue to do.

We have initiated unprecedented actions to halt Iran's entrenchment in Syria. We have acted to counter attempts to transfer precision-guided munitions to Syria and Lebanon. We have continued to act to thwart the Iranian nuclear program. We have dealt a blow to terrorist organizations that have attacked Israeli cities with rockets. In Operation Guardian of the Walls one year and eight months ago, under your command, Aviv, the IDF dealt a blow to Hamas, the harshest blow in its history. The calm along the border with the Gaza Strip is the direct result of establishing deterrence by brandishing the IDF's iron fist.

Our military becoming stronger is a crucial part of our nation becoming stronger. A strong military is not only critical in times of war, but also for establishing peace. In our region, but elsewhere too, si vis pacem, para bellum—if you want peace, prepare for war. And those who are prepared for war will achieve peace. The fact that we have better intelligence and are stronger in operations, technology, innovation, and of course in diplomacy and economically, paved the path to the Abraham Accords, which we signed.

Aviv, several months ago you visited Bahrain and then Morocco. I saw photographs of you with the military chiefs of Bahrain and Morocco. We are benefiting from increasing cooperation between our countries. There is no better demonstration of Israel's new standing in the region—from the Arabian Gulf to the Atlantic Ocean. On behalf of the people of Israel, thank you, Aviv, for your many years of dedicated service in the IDF and to the security of the State of Israel.

You will now have the opportunity to spend more time with your lovely family, travel the world, take up old hobbies that I learned of while preparing for this speech—playing music and painting. I would love to see your artwork and hear you play. We all wish you success and contentment in the future.

Incoming IDF chief, Lt.-Gen. Herzi Halevi, son of Lina, who is with us today, and the late Shlomo, whom I knew and respected. Herzi is Herzl, and it's only fitting that we have a chief of general staff who bears that name, given that the wonderful story of our nation's revival starts with the national vision that Herzl envisaged and championed. Herzl wanted to remove our shackles of torment in exile. He instilled in us a will to be independent, to hold our heads high and resist those who would kill us.

Until the end of the 19th century, Herzl spoke of large-scale Jewish settlement in the Land of Israel, under the protection of self-defense, so he wrote. From that time on, in addition to our becoming rooted in the soil of our homeland, the ethos of self-defense grew—in the defense organizations, in the Jewish Legion, in the underground paramilitary organizations and in the IDF.

I am always excited to meet our wonderful soldiers: young men and women who were born in Israel, new olim, lone soldiers. The gleam in their eyes fills the heart with immense pride and a sense of security. Each generation receives the command from its predecessor, and passes it on to those who follow. You too, Herzi, inherited the charge, in the most painful way and the most moving way.

Your uncle, the late Herzi Halevi, a paratrooper for whom you were named, fell in the Six Day War, in the battle to free Jerusalem. I remember as a young boy in wartime Jerusalem hearing the tragic news of his death. The Jerusalem youth all knew him, and I remember the moment I was told Herzi Halevi fell. His final words, moments before he died, were "The wall, the wall." Following in his footsteps, you also chose to serve as a defensive wall for Israel.

Here is a bit of history: You are the first IDF chief of staff who was born after the Six Day War. A red beret, responding to the call "After me!", serving in the elite IDF units. I am very familiar with one of them, Sayeret Matkal, from the days I served in the unit and as the person who gave you, as its commander, the green light for many missions. I was always impressed by your genuineness, your determination, your meticulousness and attention to detail and your discretion.

We expect and trust that you will further hone the IDF's capabilities in deterrence, in defense, in offense, in each command and unit.

You will also deal with problems that need solutions: continuing to rehabilitate the ground forces, expertise in ground maneuvers, the competence of the reserve army, arms theft from inside army bases, and something you discussed yesterday at length, Aviv, valuable human resources leaving the army. These are things that the government will have to deal with. Minister of Finance, I'm looking at you. This won't be easy, but it is important.

Herzi, you probably know from your experience in battle that not only we are advancing. The enemy is also learning, drawing conclusions and growing stronger. Therefore, you, along with all the IDF units, must be prepared for the future. Do not settle for what has been done, as important as it may be, but rather initiate changes that will better prepare the IDF for the battlefield of the future. And I don't only mean equipping the IDF with sophisticated weaponry and employing war tactics. Equipment matters, technology matters, tactics and strategy matter—but none make people redundant.

The most important thing is to have a fighting spirit, and especially the knowledge that we are fighting for our home, for the land of our ancestors. That is the true source of our strength. What is our goal? What is your mission? Simply put: to win.

I mentioned earlier that Herzl is a name that comes with responsibility. Herzl identified the dangers facing our people and prepared a practical course of action to ensure our existence. The government of Israel identifies the dangers today as well, and directs the IDF to prepare a practical course of action to thwart the threat to our existence.

Iran, which I mentioned before, is responsible for 90% of the problems in the Middle East. The aggression of the extremist regime in Tehran destabilizes the region time and again. This regime threatens to destroy us and to harm other countries that are turning towards us. As the person who is privileged to lead this strong country and this wonderful nation, I say here loud and clear: we will not wait for the sword to be placed at our neck.

The IDF, together with the Mossad and the ISA, will do anything to fight our enemies. Being familiar with the heavy price of bereavement, we will not be, nor have we been, drawn into unnecessary wars. Safeguarding human life is part of who we are. But if and when the need arises, we will fight for what is important.

There will be situations in which we will have to be willing to make sacrifices in order to maintain our freedom, our security and our very existence.

Herzi, you will navigate the IDF's path in the coming years. We have faith in your capabilities and we wish you every success. I will conclude with the words that Moshe Dayan said about Meir Har-Zion when he took over: The ranks you wear on your shoulders are not ornamental decorations, but operative decorations. They are not merely an adornment, but a binding symbol of command and operational excellence. Congratulations and good luck, Lt.-Gen. Herzi Halevi, the IDF's 23rd Chief of the General Staff.
