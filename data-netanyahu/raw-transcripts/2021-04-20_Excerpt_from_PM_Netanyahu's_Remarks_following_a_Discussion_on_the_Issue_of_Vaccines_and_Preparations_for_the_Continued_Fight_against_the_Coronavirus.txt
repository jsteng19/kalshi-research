Following is an excerpt from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks today, following a discussion on the issue of vaccines and preparations for the continued fight against the coronavirus: "I come here from a discussion with the Health Minister and health system people, following my agreement with the CEOs of Pfizer and Moderna on the additional supply of another 16 million vaccines for the citizens of Israel. We are preparing for another vaccines campaign in around six months so get your shoulders ready and your children because we estimate that by then vaccines will be approved for children. There could always be a surprise by a new variant, the Indian or some other. The exit from the coronavirus up until today and our avoidance of the coronavirus in the future is assured as long as there is no such surprise. One of the ways to prevent these surprises is to tighten our outer envelope. We have discussed this at length, the various possibilities that the Health Minister spoke about. We are also discussing them vis-a-vis our foreign relations and with several countries. My approach and that of the health system is that it is necessary to tighten because we are in a reality that is still completely unclear."
