The Cabinet today, discussed two proposals, thegoal of which is to promote Zionism by means of contact with global Jewish communities, encouraging their members to visit Israel and strengthening Zionist identity among young people in Israel.

According to the proposals, the Government would work to increase the number of young Diaspora Jews who visit Israel in the framework of Birthright Israel to 50,000 by 2013, with the goal that one out of every two young Jews should visit Israel. According to data submitted to the Government, Birthright Israel reduces the rate of intermarriage among Diaspora Jewish youth and increases the tendency to act for and explain Israel on campuses and in other social forums.

The Cabinet also discussed a plan to cultivate Zionist leadership and action. According to the proposal, a committee chaired by the Director-General of the Prime Minister's Office would award prizes to encourage young people who initiate activities that express the Zionist idea and would aid Government ministries in encouraging Zionist leadership projects

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was among those who planned Birthright Israel, thanked PMO Dir.-Gen. Eyal Gabai for working to formulate and budget for the proposals and said, "It is important that young Jews around the world get to know Israel and our wonderful people and heritage, with their feet. Such an experience would strengthen the bonds between Diaspora Jews and Israel."
