Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this morning , at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem, met with US Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin.

Following are additional remarks by Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"Secretary Mnuchin, welcome back to Jerusalem, with your excellent team. You were here last in October, when you accompanied the UAE's Minister of State for Financial Affairs on what was truly a historic occasion: the first ever official visit to Israel by a senior Emirati official.

I know this time you come to us following a successful visit in Khartoum, during which Sudan formally joined the Abraham Accords.

I want to thank President Trump and all of you in the administration for all you have done and are doing for peace. You've made a real difference, achieving one breakthrough after another, bringing the UAE, Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan into the circle of peace. I have no doubt that more Arab and Muslim countries will follow.

I also want to commend the maximum pressure campaign on Iran. Under your leadership, the US Treasury has played a crucial role in applying and enforcing sanctions on the Iranian regime.

I want to thank you for your own personal involvement in this tremendously important campaign. It must be continued to prevent Iran from continuing its campaign of aggression and terror throughout the region and to prevent Iran from rushing to a nuclear arsenal.

If we just go back to the JCPOA, what will happen and may already be happening is that many other countries in the Middle East will rush to arm themselves with nuclear weapons. That is a nightmare and that is folly. It should not happen.

Mr. Secretary, we have had the opportunity to speak. We see eye-to-eye on this and so many other things. I look forward to having one more discussion with you before you go back to America, and I want to thank you again for your extraordinary friendship."
