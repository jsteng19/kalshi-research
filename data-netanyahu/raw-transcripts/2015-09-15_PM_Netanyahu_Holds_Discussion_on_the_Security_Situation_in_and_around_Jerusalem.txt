Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this evening convened a discussion on the security situation in and around Jerusalem and said at the start of the meeting: "We will use all necessary measures to fight against those who throw stones, firebombs, pipebombs and fireworks in order to attack civilians and police. On the eve of the holiday it was again proven that throwing stones can kill. Such actions will be met with very sharp punitive and preventive responses. We will lead systemic changes and will set a new standard of deterrence and prevention."

It was decided to increase steps in several areas: Changing open-fire orders will be examined as will be setting minimum sentences for these offenses and imposing heavy fines on minors – and their parents – who commit these offenses.

Prime Minister Netanyahu emphasized that Israel is committed to maintaining the status quo on the Temple Mount and added that rioters would not be allowed to prevent Jews from visiting the Mount. The Prime Minister directed that a further discussion be held next week in order to advance the steps decided on this evening.

Also attending the discussion were Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon, Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan, Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked, Jerusalem Affairs Minister Zeev Elkin, Transportation and Road Safety Minister Yisrael Katz, Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat, Acting Police Commissioner Bentzi Sau. ISA Director Yoram Cohen, Attorney General Yehuda Weinstein, National Security Adviser Yossi Cohen, Foreign Ministry Director General Dr. Dore Gold, attorney Isaac Molcho and other senior officials.
