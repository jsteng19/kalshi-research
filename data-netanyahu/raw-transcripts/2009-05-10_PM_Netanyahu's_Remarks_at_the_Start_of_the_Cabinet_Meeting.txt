Following are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting today:

"Today, we will continue the approval process for the state budget and the economic plan. We are doing this even as we are beset by two major crises. The first is the global economic crisis, unprecedented in the past 80 years. The second is an accumulation of very serious economic threats against the state. We will need to balance between economic, security and other needs. However, we stated that we would do our utmost to prevent hurting the weakest populations and, therefore, I would like to reiterate that we will rescind measures that adversely affect Holocaust survivors, the elderly and the handicapped. Additionally, we will cancel the tax on hospitalization days. There are still other measures that we will consider. To the extent that we reach an agreement – a package deal with the Histadrut and the employers – I assume that many other issues will also be dropped. In any case, we have a great responsibility for the country's needs and we will need to act responsibly while showing maximum concern for the weakest populations.”
