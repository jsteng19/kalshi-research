Prime Benjamin Netanyahu and Ukraine Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman, this morning, in Kiev, attended an innovation event with local industrialists and high-tech entrepreneurs. Ukraine Prime Minister Groysman and Ukraine Government Innovation Fund Head Deputy Minister Volodimir Stabniuk awarded Prime Minister Netanyahu a certificate of appreciation for Israel's assistance in establishing the eco-system in the field of innovation in Ukraine. At the beginning of his remarks, Prime Minister Netanyahu referred to the expansion of bilateral economic cooperation: "I think that we are standing before a tremendous opportunity. I thank you, Volodymyr, for all the work that you did to enhance our cooperation – the free trade agreement, and the economic ties between Ukraine and Israel. They will serve both our peoples well. I believe that Ukraine is standing before a great opportunity. It’s one that should not be missed." Prime Minister Netanyahu also referred to taxation policy that encourages economic growth: "Keep it simple and keep it low. My natural tendency is always to think about how to lower the tax rates, but it depends where you are on the hump. And it’s not a simple thing to consider that. My experience has been lower tax rates and you’ll increase revenues." Also in attendance were Ukraine Finance Minister Markarova Oksana, Deputy Foreign Minister Tzipi Hotovely, National Economic Council Chairman Prof. Avi Simhon, Israeli Ambassador to Ukraine Joel Lion and Ukraine Ambassador to Israel Hennadii Nadolenko.
