Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: "Meir Har-Tzion was among the greatest of our heroes -- a daring fighter steeped in love of the land and the people. Along with his comrades in arms, he paved new ways of initiative and daring in IDF operations. He provided inspiration for the generations of soldiers who came after him. I knew Meir as a modest and introspective man, and for the several months in which he helped me train soldiers in the unit, I learned to recognize a unique personality upon whose shoulders the defenders of our nation were raised. I salute a legendary fighter who will always serve as an example of sacrifice on behalf of the nation."
