Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today, met with members of the Israel Security Council led by Maj.-Gen. (ret.) Uzi Dayan.

The Israel Security Council is a public body that includes leading personalities with backgrounds and experience in various public, security and diplomatic fields, and which seeks to advance national security issues and Jewish-Zionist solidarity with Israel.

Prime Minister Netanyahu emphasized the need to deal with the main strategic threats, such as maintaining a solid Jewish majority in the State of Israel, preventing the creation of a hostile Palestinian entity that could threaten Israel from Judea and Samaria as is the case today in Gaza, the Iranian threat and the de-legitimization assault against Israel.

Prime Minister Netanyahu explained the strategic importance of achieving a peace agreement with the Palestinians but stressed that the test will not be in signing the agreement but in implementing it. Therefore, the actual implementation of agreed-upon security arrangements must be ensured.

The Israel Security Council members emphasized the need to insist upon clear red lines in the negotiations with the Palestinians, especially maintaining the Jordan Valley as Israel's eastern security border. They also spoke about the need to strengthen Jewish-democratic identity in Israel and to prevent Iran from arming itself with nuclear weapons.

It was agreed that similar meetings would be held in order to advance national issues.
