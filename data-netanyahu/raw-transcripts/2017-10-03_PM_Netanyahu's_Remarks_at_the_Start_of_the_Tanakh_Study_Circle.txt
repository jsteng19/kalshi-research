Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today at the start of a meeting of the Tanakh Study Circle at the Prime Minister's Residence, made the following remarks:

"Whoever talks about peace needs to say, first of all, that it is necessary to recognize the State of Israel, the state of the Jewish People. Peace requires recognition of the State of Israel, the national state of the Jewish People. We are not interested in a bogus reconciliation in which the Palestinian factions reconcile with each other at the expense of our existence. Therefore, we expect to see three things: One – recognition of the State of Israel; two – dismantling the military arm of Hamas; and three – severing the link with Iran, which calls for our destruction. These things are basic and we insist on them."
