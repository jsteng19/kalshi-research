Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this morning (Thursday, 30 October 2014), at his Jerusalem office, held a special discussion in the wake of last night's terrorist attack in which Yehuda Glick was shot. Participating in the discussion were Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon, Public Defense Minister Itzhak Aharonovitch, ISA Director Yoram Cohen, Israel Police Commissioner Insp.-Gen. Yohanan Danino, Jerusalem District Police Commander Moshe Edri, Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat and representatives from the Attorney General's office, the Justice Ministry and the IDF.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said at the start of the meeting: "I would like to send my best wishes for a full and quick recovery to Yehuda Glick, who is now fighting for his life. I would also like to commend the ISA and the Israel Police for quickly solving this act of terrorism. A few days ago, I said that we were facing a wave of incitement by radical Islamic elements and by Palestinian Authority Chairman Abu Mazen who said that Jews must be prevented from going up to the Temple Mount by any means possible. I still have not heard from the international community so much as one word of condemnation for these inflammatory remarks. The international community needs to stop its hypocrisy and take action against inciters, against those who try to change the status quo. I have ordered significant reinforcements so that we can maintain both security in Jerusalem and the status quo in the holy places. This struggle might be long, and here, like in other struggles, we must first of all, lower the flames. No side should take the law into its own hands. We must be level-headed and act with determination and responsibility, and so we shall."
