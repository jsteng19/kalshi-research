Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening, sent his condolences on the passing of former Polish Foreign Minister Wladyslaw Bartoszewski:

"On behalf of the people and government of Israel, I wish to extend our deepest condolences to the family of Wladyslaw Bartoszewski and to the people of Poland. Bartoszewski will be remembered by his countrymen as a Polish patriot who fought for freedom and democracy. In Israel he will remain forever in our hearts as one of the Righteous Among the Nations who risked his life to rescue Jews from the Nazis. In my meetings with him, I was deeply impressed by his humanity and erudition. His light will continue to shine."
