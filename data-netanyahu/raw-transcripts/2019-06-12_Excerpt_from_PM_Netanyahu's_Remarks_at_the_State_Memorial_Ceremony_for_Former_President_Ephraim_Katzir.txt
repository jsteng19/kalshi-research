Following is an excerpt from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks, at the Rehovot cemetery, at the state memorial ceremony for former President Ephraim Katzir: "The chain of tests that we are dealing with is unending. We respond vigorously and with force to all attacks against us; however, we do not take action only after the fact. We deny the enemy's capabilities before the fact. We are acting methodically and consistently to prevent our enemies from establishing offensive bases against us in our vicinity."
