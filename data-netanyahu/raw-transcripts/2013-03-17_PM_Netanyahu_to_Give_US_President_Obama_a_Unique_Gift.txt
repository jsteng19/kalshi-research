At the start of their working meeting on Wednesday, 20 March 2013, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will give US President Barack Obama a symbolic gift: A gold-coated 0.04 square-mm nano-chip that with the Israeli and US declarations of independence, etched side-by-side to a depth of 0.00002 mm.

The declarations were etched, using a focused beam of high energy gallium ions, on a chip that was affixed to a Jerusalem stone dating to the late Second Temple Period (1st century BCE to 1st century CE), that was used to seal clay vessels that held liquids and spices. The gift was developed at the Russell Berrie Nanotechnology Institute at the Technion. (Click here for a Technion press release, including photographs.)

The unique gift symbolizes the main messages of the visit â€“ the strong and deep state of bilateral ties, the link of thousands of years between the People of Israel and the Land of Israel, and the leading technological status of Israel's research and development centers.
