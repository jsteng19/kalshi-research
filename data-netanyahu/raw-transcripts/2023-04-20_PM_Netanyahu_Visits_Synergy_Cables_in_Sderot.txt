Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening, visited Synergy Cables in Sderot. He toured the factory, which manufactures high-tension cables, and its testing labs.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"I am very moved by this visit because every time I come to Sderot and the area around the Gaza Strip, I see the great development. In the past decade, we have 70% population growth here. This is not expressed just in highways, the train station, other transportation upgrades, and the doubling of thousands of housing units â€“ but also in industry.

There is industry here in the good and original sense of the word, of manufacturing products that assist in the growth of our economic infrastructure. I am very impressed by this factory; it has a great past. It was built in the 1930s and has been upgraded with the most up-to-date technology.

In the end, all of this technology is operated by people; it is operated by you. First of all, I appreciate the work you are doing here, opposite neighbors who want to uproot you.

The immense growth is the right answer to terrorism. The right answer to terrorism is to strike at the terrorists and we did so in several very powerful operations that always need to be resumed because that is the character of these neighbors. The second thing is to plant our roots very deep in the land. This means communities, industry and work.

I simply want to thank you for what you are doing not just for this important factory or this important community but for this important part of our country. The area around Gaza is Israel. You contribute to Israel's security and economy. Thank you from the heart."

Also participating in the event were Sderot Mayor Alon Davidi, MK Hanoch Milwidsky, MK Eli Dalal, Manufacturers Association President Dr. Ron Tomer, Prime Minister's Office Director General Yossi Shelley, Synergy Cables owner Ronen Elad, CEO Ronen Yehezkel and factory employees.
