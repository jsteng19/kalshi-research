Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, visited the IDF Judea Brigade HQ and issued the following statement:

"We're doing everything in our power to bring back our three kidnapped teenagers. They were kidnapped by Hamas. We had no doubt of that. It's absolutely certain. Hamas repeatedly has called for the kidnap and murder of Israeli citizens. It is an organization that is designated as a terror organization by many countries, and it is a terror organization that is committed to Israel's destruction. I expect President Abbas to dissolve the union with this murderous terrorist organization. I think that's important for our common future. Thank you."
