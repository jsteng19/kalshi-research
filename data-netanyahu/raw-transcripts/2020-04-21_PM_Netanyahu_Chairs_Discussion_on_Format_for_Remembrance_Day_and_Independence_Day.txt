Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today, chaired a discussion on the format for Remembrance Day and Independence Day. Defense Minister Naftali Bennett, Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan, Health Minister Yaakov Litzman, Culture and Sports Minister Miri Regev, National Security Council head Meir Ben-Shabbat, Acting Israel Police Commissioner Motti Cohen, Health Ministry Director General Moshe Bar Siman Tov, Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit and Defense Ministry Director General Udi Adam attended the discussion.

After hearing the recommendation of the memorial organizations, it was decided that – subject to Cabinet approval – given the danger of infection, arrival to cemeteries and memorial sites on Remembrance Day will not be permitted; the police will close the access routes.

Bereaved families are called upon to make reduced visits to cemeteries in the days remaining until Remembrance Day, subject to social distancing restrictions.

Remembrance Day ceremonies will be held without attendance. Symbolic ceremonies will be held in military cemeteries with the participation of a small number of soldiers and commanders, without attendance. The ceremonies will be broadcast to the public in a format to be determined by the Defense Ministry. Traffic outside cities will not be permitted on Remembrance Day except to workplaces and for permitted purchases.

A general lockdown – similar to that which applied during Passover – will be imposed on Independence Day.

The foregoing will be submitted for Cabinet approval forthwith.
