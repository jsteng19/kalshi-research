Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu toured near the security barrier in the Tarkumiye-Metar area He was accompanied by Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman, Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan, Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee Chairman Avi Dichter and IDF Chief-of-Staff Lt.-Gen. Gadi Eisenkot, and was briefed by GOC Central Command Maj.-Gen. Roni Numa and Security Barrier Authority Director Brig.-Gen. Eran Ophir.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"We decided that we would close the gaps. We will prevent illegals and terrorists from reaching Israel's cities. This is complicated. We also need to defend the communities. And, of course, we need to deal with the entire chain of offenders, including those who employ, house and assist them. We have spoken about all of this, as well as the issue of the crossings and we are working energetically, and I am impressed by the work. We will soon see it firsthand and I think that it will be clear to you that this project will be completed. It is important for the security of the citizens and State of Israel.

During my visit to Africa I told you that an additional country that we did not have relations with would soon declare the resumption of relations and this has happened today with Guinea. In the coming days I think that yet another country will be added. This is part of a process that is gaining momentum and it is very important. It is opening Israel to Africa and, of course, it is helping us in other areas.

There is continuous, accessible and efficient public broadcasting in the State of Israel. It has encountered technical problems regarding programs that have not existed up until now but it this will happen. Regarding those who are talking about freedom of the press, this does not fit in with their efforts to close Yisrael Hayom at any price. This is not exactly freedom of the press; apparently they have other motives."
