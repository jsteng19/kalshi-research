Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today: "The claim by the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court that Jews do not have a right to live in the Jewish homeland is pure antisemitism. So is the claim that Jews have no right to defend themselves against those who seek their annihilation. As we celebrate Hanukkah, the ICC issues decrees that are just as antisemitic as those of the ancient Seleucid Empire against the Maccabees. We triumphed then, we will triumph now."
