Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sharply condemns Abu Mazen's condolence letter to the family of Yehuda Glick's would-be assassin. "When we are trying to calm the situation, Abu Mazen sends condolences over the death of one who tried to perpetrate a reprehensible murder. The time has come for the international community to condemn him for such actions," the Prime Minister said.
