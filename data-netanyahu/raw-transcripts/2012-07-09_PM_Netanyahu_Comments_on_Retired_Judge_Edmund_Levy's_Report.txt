Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today commented on retired Supreme Court Judge Edmund Levy's report:

"First of all, I very much appreciate the efforts of Judge Levy and the people who worked with him. They did serious, quiet work over long months. I will submit this report to the

Ministerial Committee on Settlement Affairs

that I established and we will discuss it and make a decision.

This is important. This report, in my opinion, discusses the question of the legality and legitimacy of the settlement movement in Judea and Samaria on the basis of the facts and claims that merit serious examination."
