Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the Start of the Government Meeting: "I am due to leave next week for meetings in the US with US President Donald Trump. These come in the wake of the great victory that we achieved in Operation Rising Lion."

"I am due to leave next week for meetings in the US with US President Donald Trump; Vice President Vance; Secretary of State and National Security Adviser Marco Rubio; Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth; the President's envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, the Commerce Secretary – we have several items to close beforehand in order to reach the trade agreement, and several additional matters; meetings with Congressional and Senate leaders and security meetings which I will not detail here.

These come in the wake of the great victory that we achieved in Operation Rising Lion. Taking advantage of the success is no less an important part of achieving the success. On two issues, I would like to thank you – ministers of the Government. You are doing the work – you have done, and are doing, critical work to realize these achievements. Of course, I would like to expedite the rebuilding, which includes almost all, if not all, of the ministries here.

I think that there is great value in this, that there should be a unification of forces here. This finds expression among the people, but also in the Government and the Knesset. I must also say something about the opposition, which during the great challenge, lined up, almost all of them. This is important and I hope that it will be preserved as a compass for the future. In any case, each and every one of you has my gratitude for the exceptional cooperation and for the excellent work. Thank you very much."
