Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, made the following remarks at the start of his meeting with Indian Home Affairs Minister Rajnath Singh: "I spoke today to King Abdullah of Jordan and we agreed that we'll do every effort to calm the situation. I explained to him that we're keeping the status quo on the Temple Mount and that this includes Jordan's traditional role there, as consistent withthe peace treaty between Israel and Jordan. We have to make every effort to restore calm, quiet and security. But I think we have to make that effort throughout the world."
