Following are Prime Minister Netanyahu's remarks at the start of the Corona Cabinet meeting:

"The State of Israel has signed an agreement with Moderna that will allow us to purchase vaccines. The company is making progress in development and claims that they can achieve it by the middle of next year. We hope that they will succeed but we have no guarantee. However, we are interested in receiving these vaccines quickly if and when they will be developed. This puts us in a very good position globally.

Of course, we will continue with our efforts here in the State of Israel, at the Israel Institute for Biological Research, and we hope that results will be achieved there as well. Of course, this will resolve the dilemma that this committee has been constantly dealing with – how to stop the development of the disease on the one hand, and how, of course, to continue opening up the economy on the other. There has been a very sharp increase in morbidity. At this meeting we will discuss the various means to block this increase.

We – Benny Gantz, Minister Troper and I – just met with business sector representatives who deal with culture and performances. We intend to help them open up under the Health Ministry directives; we hope to complete the work within 24 hours.

I hold here the report in The Economist that ranks countries according to how they have dealt with the virus problem. We are ranked among the eight most successful countries. We received a very good grade. However, I will say that this reflects the past, not the future. The future starts now. We have an increase in morbidity; it must be lowered. We must continue to open up the economy. Today, we will also discuss how to do this responsibly with transportation but we must deal with the general increase in morbidity as well as with the specific centers of morbidity. To this end, the special ministerial committee convened before this meeting."
