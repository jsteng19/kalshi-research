Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a daily update for the public:

"Our wonderful combat pilots are in the skies above the burning city of Tehran. We are determined to complete the mission of removing the double threat".

The Prime Minister added: "Four of our citizens were killed in Tamra. I've heard cheers of rejoicing and I reject that vehemently. The missile makes no distinction. It harms Jews as well as Arabs. They're coming to destroy all of us, and we stand in this battle together".
