Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, held a series of professional discussions on the continuation of steps to deal with the corona crisis vis-Ã -vis procurement and acquisition, and preparations ahead of a lockdown. Prime Minister Netanyahu instructed that preparations be made for a significant tightening of the restrictions on movement so as to further reduce the number of people outside their homes in order to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. The Finance Ministry will formulate a plan to further reduce work. The Prime Minister directed that enforcement be stepped up at supermarkets and at pharmacies in order to ensure the maintaining of safe distances, disinfecting and strict adherence to Health Ministry instructions. Prime Minister Netanyahu noted that if there is no improvement in the rate of infection in the next two days, there will be no alternative but to impose a lockdown.
