PM Netanyahu attended the dedication of a new concourse at Ben-Gurion International Airport Terminal 3.

Following is an excerpt from his remarks:

"I am leaving for the Munich Security Conference in Germany. This is the most important security conference in the world; I have been invited to present Israel's position to the assembled heads of state and defense ministers.

I will clarify Iran's part in the recent events in the north and its continuing efforts to establish a military presence against us in Syria, and our steadfast determination to thwart this aggression.

Together we will continue to strengthen the State of Israel and in the spirit of this occasion I can add â€“ with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm [Deuteronomy 26:8]."
