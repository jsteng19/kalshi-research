Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke this afternoon with Dudu Arad, the brother of captive navigator Ron Arad, who was taken captive 25 years ago today. The Prime Minister recalled his conversations with Ron's late mother, Batya, in which she spoke of her longing to see her son. "Ron Arad's fate was before my eyes when I approved the agreement for the return of Gilad Shalit," the Prime Minister said.
