The Cabinet, today (Wednesday, 30 December 2020), in a conference call, approved Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's proposal to extend various civilian and business licenses that will expire at the end of 2020 and during 2021. The move is being led by Prime Minister's Office Acting Director General Tzachi Braverman and is another in a series of steps to ease bureaucratic and regulatory restrictions. Among the eligible licenses are business permits, manufacturing permits, import licenses and construction permits; existing license conditions will remain in force. License extensions will work as follows: * Licenses that were originally valid for one year will be extended for three months * Licenses that were originally valid for one-three years will be extended for six months * Licenses that were originally valid for over three years will be extended by one year.
