Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting, made the following remarks: “Today we mark 24 years since the assassination of former Prime Minister and Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin. This murder is a wound for generations on our people and our state. I will honor the memory of Yitzhak Rabin at the memorial ceremonies this afternoon on Mt. Herzl and at the Knesset, and I will expand on this matter. During the meeting, I will submit the appointment of Naftali Bennett as Defense Minister. I wish him success. I would also like to thank Minister Uri Ariel, who informed me of his resignation as Minister of Agriculture. I would like to thank him for his splendid and dedicated service over the years to the State of Israel, the government and the Knesset. Today, we will decide on the participation of the State of Israel at the 2020 Dubai Expo. This reflects on the ground the continued progress in normalization with the Arab states. We have increasingly tighter relations with at least half a dozen Arab states. This has been done thanks to our policy that combines strength, common interests and very careful step-by-step approach to advance normalization, which in my view, will bring about peaceful relations in the end. It will take time but we will get there.” The Prime Minister added: “I agree with Liberman that there is no genuine need to drag the State of Israel into another election. It is both possible and necessary to form a broad national unity government as the President has proposed. It is still not too late to do this.”
