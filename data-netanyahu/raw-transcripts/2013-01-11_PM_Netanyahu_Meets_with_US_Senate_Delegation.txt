Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today met with a group of US Senators led by Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY). At the start of the meeting, Prime Minister Netanyahu said: "It's very good to see you, in Jerusalem again. You're old friends and we're in challenging times, great turbulence in our region, great challenges to our security, America's security and our common interests. My priority, if I'm elected for a next term as Prime Minister, will be first to stop Iran from getting nuclear weapons. I think that was and remains the highest priority for both our countries. I appreciate the American support and your support for that end".

Sen. McConnell said: "As everybody in Israel knows, there are a lot of things we disagree on in America, we've had big battles over deficit and debt, but there's broad bi-partisan support for Israel, and our agenda in this part of the world is the same as your agenda. You're one of our best friends and we're happy to continue that relationship".
