If we do not deal with bureaucratic pitfalls, we will simply sink. We must embrace anti-bureaucracy and use all necessary legislative means in order to do so and to advance the economy. It is the task of all of us to promote production and initiatives and to reduce bureaucracy. These are what will move us forward."

He also praised the Prime Minister's determination to assist the business sector by reducing bureaucratic impediments, which, he hoped, would lead to growth, greater employment and a higher standard of living.
