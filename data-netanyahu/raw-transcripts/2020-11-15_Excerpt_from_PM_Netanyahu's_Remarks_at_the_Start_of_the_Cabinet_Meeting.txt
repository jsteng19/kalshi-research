Following is an excerpt from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahuâ€™s remarks at the start of the Cabinet meeting, today:

"This morning, the IDF attacked Hamas infrastructures and targets in the Gaza Strip. We will not tolerate any attacks against the State of Israel and the citizens of Israel.

I warn the terrorist organizations in Gaza, even during the coronavirus crisis, do not try us.

I will never go into detail about our operational plans but I tell them, the price of continued aggression will be heavy, very heavy."
