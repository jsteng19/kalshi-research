Prime Minister Netanyahu: "This is a global breakthrough." Three years ago, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu directed the then Prime Minister's Office (PMO) Director General to form a team to advance the field of alternative proteins based on the understanding that it would lead to innovative economic strengthening of the State of Israel, provide food security and food safety, and promote animal welfare. The team, led by the PMO Director General, included the Health Ministry, the Innovation Authority, the Science Ministry, the Economy Ministry and the Agriculture Ministry. Pursuant to the team's work, regulatory permits were issued this year for the production of milk without using cows, and – today – meat without using animals. Prime Minister Netanyahu: "Israel is the first country to approve the sale of cultured meat. This is a global breakthrough in the field of alternative protein and important news for food security, environmental protection and concern for animals." Over the past year, Prime Minister Netanyahu has held several tours and meetings with cultured meat companies, and discussions together with supportive Israeli economic leaders. Cooperation between the relevant Government ministries and companies in the field have led to this breakthrough.
