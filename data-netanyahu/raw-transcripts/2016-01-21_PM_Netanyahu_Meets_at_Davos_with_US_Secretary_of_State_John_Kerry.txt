Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, held a very good private meeting with US Secretary of State John Kerry. The two men discussed a range of regional issues including Syria, Iran, Daesh and the Palestinians.

Prime Minister Netanyahu showed US Secretary of State Kerry the Palestinian incitement video, which he already showed to other foreign ministers at the start of the week, in order to show that Palestinian incitement – by the leadership, in the media and in the education system – is still a very significant and decisive factor as an engine for terrorism.
