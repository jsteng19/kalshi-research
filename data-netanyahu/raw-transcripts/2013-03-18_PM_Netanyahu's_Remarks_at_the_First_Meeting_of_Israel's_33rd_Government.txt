Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening made the following remarks at the first meeting of Israel's 33rd Government:

"This is the third time that I have had the honor of opening a meeting of a new government. I must tell you that I am moved. This is not self-evident. Nothing here is self-evident and we all bear the great responsibility, the responsibility and the privilege.

Of all the three times that I have had this privilege of leading the State of Israel, I cannot remember a more challenging period vis-à-vis the accumulated risks on one hand and the opportunities on the other, and of course, the expectations of Israel's citizens. I think that it is within our power to meet all of these challenges, without exception.

Today, we are opening the Government table and we are also cleaning it. We are putting aside disagreements and are working together. There are excellent, qualified, experienced and invigorating people here and the only way we can succeed is by cooperating. I am certain that we will do so. Cooperation and unity. I very much encourage discussion around this table. I encourage people – as it will become clear to the newcomers – to speak their minds. I think that by hearing all sides we will, in the end, make correct and balanced decisions. The citizens of Israel expect us to work together and achieve results. I would like to thank everyone for their cooperation up to now, and from now on. I would like to wish Israeli citizens a Happy Passover, and our Christian citizens a Happy Easter. I am honored to open this meeting of the Government."
