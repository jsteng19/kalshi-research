Pursuant to Prime Minister Netanyahu's efforts with Russian President Vladimir Putin, an Israeli citizen is currently on her way to Israel after having crossed the border to Syria and having been held by the Syrians.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"Several days ago, a young Israeli woman crossed the border to Syria. I spoke twice with my friend Russian President Vladimir Putin. I requested his assistance in returning her, and he acted. I would like to thank him for again having joined in an effort to bring Israeli citizens back to the country. Israel has always, and will always, do everything it can to bring its citizens back home. I would like to thank the President of the state, the head of the National Security Council, the coordinator for captives and the missing, the IDF, the ISA, the Defense Ministry, the Foreign Ministry and all those who helped in this important action. Thank you."

Prime Minister Netanyahu spoke with Russian President Putin twice in recent days, on 8 February and 13 February, and requested that he assist Israel in returning the Israeli citizen. President Putin acceded to the request of Prime Minister Netanyahu, who thanked him for the assistance. The head of the National Security Council and President Putin's diplomatic adviser held continuous talks in order to complete the details of the citizen's return.

The State of Israel would like to express appreciation for the actions of the Russian President; as a gesture of goodwill Israel returned to Syria two shepherds who entered Israel and will also shorten by three months (via a pardon) the community service of Nihal Al-Maqt.
