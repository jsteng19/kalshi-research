Following are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks today at the IDF Home Front Command base:

"Thank you, Home Front Defense Minister Matan Vilnai. It is no coincidence that we appointed a Home Front Defense Minister because we attribute supreme importance to defending the home front, since over the past decades, and especially in the last decade, it has become a front in every sense of the word.

We are not helpless in this area. We produce impressive capabilities here, among the leading in the world, in order to deal with a range of challenges. We also know that part of this preparation is the understanding by the IDF, which is a very strong, innovative and active organization, as well as by Israeli citizens, that we have here orderly, systematic, substantive quiet and very, very thorough action in order to secure the State of Israel's home front in all its aspects.

The strengths here are impressive. I believe that they contribute to our national fortitude, deterrent ability and resilience; we will continue to develop them. I think that this also finds expression in recent Government decisions that added budgets to Home Front Command and provided for new measures.

For example, the cellular telephone that could replace the sirens we are accustomed to hearing is much more focused. We could reach the same citizens and reduce disturbances in the country, and increase our advantage in protecting Israelis in various situations. Also, the decisions that we made to allocate considerable funds to back up the military ground-based and aerial fire service in addition to the civilian fire service. All of these are being implemented right now. Therefore, I am very impressed by what I have seen and heard here. I think that the State of Israel is acting in order to ensure its strength on all fronts, including the home front."
