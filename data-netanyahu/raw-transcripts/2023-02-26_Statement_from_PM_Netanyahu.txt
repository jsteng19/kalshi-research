Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening: "A terrible tragedy occurred today. I would like to send condolences to the Yaniv family, which lost two of its dear sons; may G-d avenge them. The IDF and the security forces are currently in pursuit of the murderer. We will find him. We will apprehend him and we will settle accounts with him. I ask – even when the blood is boiling – not to take the law into one's hands. I ask that the IDF and the security forces be allowed to carry out their work. I remind you that in recent weeks, they have targeted dozens of terrorists and thwarted dozens of attacks. Let the IDF complete its pursuit and do not take the law into your hands; together we will defeat terrorism."
