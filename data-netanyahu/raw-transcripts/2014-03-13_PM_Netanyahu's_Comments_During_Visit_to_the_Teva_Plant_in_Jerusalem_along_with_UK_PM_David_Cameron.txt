Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made the following comments during his visit, along with UK Prime Minister David Cameron, to the Teva plant in Jerusalem's Har Hotzvim industrial zone:

"At a time when the Teva plant in Ashdod is producing medicines that will be delivered to Gaza, they are firing rockets from there at innocent Israelis. So how can anybody not condemn the firing of these missiles deliberately at civilians? Precisely. Well, you're going see President Abbas soon, only a few minutes away, and unfortunately he didn't condemn the rocketing of our civilians. He condemned the fact that Israel interdicted and hit the three terrorists who fired mortars on us. That he did condemn. And that's wrong. I say we want to move to a genuine peace. To move to a genuine peace, we have to be very clear on our condemnation of terror and our support for the right to defend ourselves against terror. That is a crucial component of peace.

Our policy in the south is clear. We will strike at anyone who tries to attack us and will respond very forcefully to any attack. I would like to make it clear that whoever tries to attack our Purim celebrations â€“ we will hit them strongly. We did not achieve the greatest quiet in the south in recent years for nothing; this is our policy. It would be worthwhile for terrorists in the Gaza Strip to start internalizing the fact that they have an issue here with a very determined government and a very strong military."
