Prime Minister Netanyahu, toured ancient (Tel) Shilo together with former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Binyamin Regional Council Chairman Yisrael Gantz. Prime Minister Netanyahu: "I am very excited to be here. I came here for the first time in 1967, right after the Six Day War, as a young soldier. I remember that during navigational exercises, I went to Tel Shilo to see ancient Shilo, the capital of Israel. Here, it has revived. Under the heritage plan, we established here a visitor center so that every Jew and every tourist in Israel can come and see our first capital. This is exciting. It attests to our link with the Land of Israel and to the great wonder of the revival of Israel." Prime Minister Netanyahu visited the museum at the site which exhibits findings from the period when the Tabernacle was in Shilo and signed a clay shard from the era "The people of Israel live, also in Shilo." Prime Minister Netanyahu, former Gov. Huckabee and Binyamin Regional Council Chairman Gantz planted trees at the site.
