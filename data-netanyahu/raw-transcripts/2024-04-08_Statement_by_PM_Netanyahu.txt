Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening:

"Today I received a detailed report on the talks in Cairo. We are working constantly to attain our objectives, first and foremost the release of all of our hostages and the achieving of total victory over Hamas.

This victory requires entering Rafah and eliminating the terrorist battalions there. This will happen; there is a date."
