PM Netanyahu, today: "I convey my best wishes for a speedy recovery to the Border Police officers who were wounded in last night's operation in Tulkarm. The IDF and the security forces will continue to take courageous and determined action in order to clear out the terrorist nests in Judea and Samaria. We hold Iran directly responsible for the wave of terrorism in Judea and Samaria, in encouraging and financing murderous operations against the citizens of Israel. The Government of Israel will fight terrorism with determination and defend the citizens of Israel."
