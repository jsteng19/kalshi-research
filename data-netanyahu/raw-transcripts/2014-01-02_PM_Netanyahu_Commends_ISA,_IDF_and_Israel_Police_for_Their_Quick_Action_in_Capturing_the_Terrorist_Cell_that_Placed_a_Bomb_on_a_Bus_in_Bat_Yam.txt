Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, last night, commended the ISA, IDF and the Israel Police for their quick action in capturing the terrorist cell that had placed a bomb on a bus in Bat Yam. A Palestinian policeman was a member of the cell. "This is additional proof of the direct involvement of Palestinian Authority personnel in terrorism. The time has come for Abu Mazen to stop celebrating with released murderers, and to lead his people toward peace," the Prime Minister said.
