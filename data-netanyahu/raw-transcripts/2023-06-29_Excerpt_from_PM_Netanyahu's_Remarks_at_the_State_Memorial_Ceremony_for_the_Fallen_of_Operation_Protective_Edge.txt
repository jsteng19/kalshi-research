ollowing is an excerpt from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks, this afternoon , at the state memorial ceremony for the fallen of Operation Protective Edge, at the National Memorial Hall on Mt. Herzl in Jerusalem:

Prime Minister Netanyahu [translated from Hebrew]:

"The military rounds in recent years teach that in a fight against those who seek our lives, there can be neither respite nor weakness. We are determined to respond to every attempt to harm us, just as we did in Operation Guardians of the Walls two years ago and in Operation Shield and Arrow last month.

Since Operation Protective Edge, we have grown immeasurably stronger – in building up our power in operational responses to those who try to challenge us. Israel relies – first and foremost – on itself, regarding its security.

I also say this about Iran's attempts to develop a nuclear arsenal, and regarding the terrorist attacks of its proxies on our borders. We are increasing our strength and varying our capabilities against those who try to threaten us with destruction; on one front or on several, our response and our capabilities will be wide-ranging, determined and powerful."
