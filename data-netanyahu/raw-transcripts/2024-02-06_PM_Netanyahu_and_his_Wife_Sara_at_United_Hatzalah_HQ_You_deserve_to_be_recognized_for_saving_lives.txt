Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara, today in Jerusalem.

The Prime Minister and his wife first visited the operations center where they observed the ongoing activity and were provided with explanations by United Hatzalah Founder and President Eli Beer and CEO Eli Pollak. They were also briefed by Vice President of Operations Dovie Maisel and watched video clips on the organization's activity on Saturday, October 7. They later met with United Hatzalah volunteers who told them about their activity on that day.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"My wife and I have come to be here with Eli Beer and the thousands of United Hatzalah volunteers: Jews and Arabs, around 700 Muslim Arabs and others, who have volunteered to help and to save lives, together with secular and ultra-orthodox Jews, 50% ultra-orthodox, people who are deployed throughout the country and give of themselves. They gave on October 7, under fire, and occasionally were fired upon, and treated themselves even as they saved lives â€“ and they are doing this constantly.

I think that you deserve to be recognized for saving lives. You have saved many people and you are doing amazing work. Well done."

Prime Minister Netanyahu and his wife were accompanied by his Chief-of-Staff Tzachi Braverman and Cabinet Secretary Yossi Fuchs.
