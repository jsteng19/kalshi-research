Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this afternoon:

"I view with utmost severity the shocking scenes during the release of our hostages. This is additional proof of the inconceivable brutality of the Hamas terrorist organization.

I demand that the mediators make certain that such terrible scenes do not recur, and guarantee the safety of our hostages.

Whoever dares to harm our hostages will pay the price."
