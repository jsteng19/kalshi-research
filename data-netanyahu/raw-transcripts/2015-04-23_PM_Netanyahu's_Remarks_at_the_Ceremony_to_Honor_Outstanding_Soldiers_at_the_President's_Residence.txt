Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara, Independence Day, at the President's Residence in Jerusalem, attended the ceremony to honor outstanding soldiers. The Prime Minister chose Miriam Peretz, who lost two sons during their military service, as a source of Israeli inspiration and hope, and said: "Miriam represents our unity, sacrifice and hope. Without this willingness for sacrifice we have no existence, no future. As I look at the soldiers here I think about my son who is now undergoing combat training and I think about each one of them. I say – this is my son, this is my home. We need to know that we must see to it that the price is minimal. Our existence and our security require me, as I make a decision along with the Defense Minister and the Chief-of-Staff, to see to it that the price is minimal. Every one of them is dear to us. Miriam represents the ability to overcome this price and give us tomorrow. We do not forget anyone, neither Hadar Goldin nor Oren Shaul, who was here last year as an outstanding soldier. We forget neither the price nor the obligation but as Miriam has said – we do not forget the hope that the people of Israel will overcome." Miriam Peretz said, "The killed Uriel and Eliraz's bodies but they did not kill the Israeli spirit. They did not kill the eternal nature of Israel, the faith of this people, this moment of Israel's independence. This they have not killed. We sit here at the President's Residence. We are a people that knows sorrow and destruction but we always knew that it is possible to stand up, the torch of revival, from the destruction of the Temple to the building of the new Jerusalem. We are a people of hope; no one can take this from us."
