Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today, met with U.S. Special Representative for Iran and Senior Policy Advisor to the Secretary of State, Brian Hook. The two discussed the special efforts being made against Iranian Aggression.

Prime Minister Netanyahu: "I want to congratulate the President and your team for the powerful sanctions against Iran. It's the most important thing that has been done against the most aggressive power in the region that has to be rolled back. I think the sanctions are a very important American step to establish peace in our region and peace in the world."

Special Representative Hook: "Now that we have reimposed our sanctions we're in a position to really go after all of the revenue streams that Iran uses to fund Hamas and Hezbollah, its missile proliferation, all of the threats to peace and security that Iran presents. You are a fantastic and committed partner in this endeavor, and we're very grateful for all of the support you give." Photos by Amos Ben Gershom, GPO
