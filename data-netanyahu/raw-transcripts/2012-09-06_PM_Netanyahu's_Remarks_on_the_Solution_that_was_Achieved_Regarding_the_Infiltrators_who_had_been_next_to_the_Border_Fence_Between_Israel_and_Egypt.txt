Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu commented on the solution that was achieved, in the framework of which the infiltrators who had been next to the border fence between Israel and Egypt went back the way they came and two women and the child entered Israel.

"It is important that everyone understand that Israel is no longer a destination for infiltrators. We are determined to stop the flood of infiltrators that has been here. We built this fence and it has already lowered the number of infiltrators by 90%. We will intensify steps against those who employ illegal infiltrators and we will continue the effort to return infiltrators to their countries of origin," the Prime Minister said.
