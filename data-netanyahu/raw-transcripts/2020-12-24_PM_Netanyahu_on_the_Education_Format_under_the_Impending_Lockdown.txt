Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening: "After a consultation that I held today with the Health Minister and the Education Minister, we decided that kindergartens, grades 1-4 and grades 11-12 will continue according to the regular studies format. We did this, first of all, so that these pupils will not lose classes, and second, to make it easier for parents as well. At this time we are turning Israel into the world champion of vaccines. Yesterday, we vaccinated 65,000 citizens and by the end of next week, I hope we will reach 100,000 vaccinations a day. I want to tell you that the combination of the great vaccines operation on the one hand, and a short, quick lockdown on the other, will enable us to emerge from the coronavirus and ours will, apparently, be the first country to emerge from the coronavirus within a few weeks. This is a great blessing." # Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Health Minister Yuli Edelstein and Education Minister Yoav Galant held consultations during the day and decided that the education system for preschoolers and kindergartens, grades 1-4 (including afternoon daycare) and grades 11-12 will hold full study days even during the lockdown, according to the format that was in place under the restrictions up until now.
