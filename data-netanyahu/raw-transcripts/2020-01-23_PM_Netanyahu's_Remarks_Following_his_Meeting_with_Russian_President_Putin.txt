Prime Minister Netanyahu following his meeting with Russian President Putin: "We have just concluded an excellent working meeting between President Putin and myself. At its conclusion, President Putin asked to bring in Yaffa, Naama Issachar's mother. This was a very moving meeting. I am very grateful to you for this gesture, my friend the President." Russian President Vladimir Putin: "Honored colleagues, friends. I just met with Naama's mother. It is clear that Naama comes from a very good family. The Prime Minister's position is known to me – to decide appropriately. All of this will be taken into account when a decision is made. Today, Naama will meet with the person responsible for maintaining human rights in Russia. Her mother was very moving and supports her daughter. I said to her and I will say it again – everything will be alright."
