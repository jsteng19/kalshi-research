Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed deep sorrow over the passing of [former] Judge

Miriam Ben-Porat

: "Judge Porat was a trailblazer, an esteemed Supreme Court judge, a State Comptroller who sanctified the values of integrity and transparency, and an Israel Prize laureate. Her modesty, her upholding of principles and her dedication to the State are a model for equal opportunity and the supremacy of the rule of law in Israel. May her memory be blessed."
