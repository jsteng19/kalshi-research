Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening, in Katzrin, made the following remarks after a shell landed on the Golan Heights and the subsequent IDF strike:

"We are here celebrating the fortieth anniversary of Katzrin, the capital of the Golan Heights. I said that we will not tolerate spillover and that we will respond to every firing. During my speech shells from the Syrian side landed in our territory and the IDF has already struck back. Whoever attacks us â€“ we will attack him. This is our policy and we will continue with it."
