Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today at a meeting with

Israel Bonds leaders

, made the following remarks about the issue of the supply of natural gas from Egypt:

"We don't see this cutoff of the gas as something that is born out of political developments. It's actually a business dispute between the Israeli company and the Egyptian company.

But alongside that I have to say that we have, as I said, the reserves of gas to make Israel totally energy independent, not only from Egypt but from any other source, and to have Israel become one of the world's large exporters of natural gas. So we're quite confident on that score."
