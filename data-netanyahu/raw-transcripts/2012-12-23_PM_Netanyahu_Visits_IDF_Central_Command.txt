Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening, visited IDF Central Command where he was briefed by Defense Minister Ehud Barak, IDF Chief-of-Staff Lt.-Gen. Benny Gantz and GOC Central Command Maj.-Gen. Nitzan Alon on recent events in the Central Command area.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said, "We are here, first of all, to receive an update on recent events in this area. Our mission is to maintain the security of the citizens of the State of Israel both in the settlements and, of course, in the country as a whole. We are aware that there is an upsurge in activity and I would like to receive an exact briefing on this issue. Of course, we are committed to acting in this area, as well as in other areas, in order to ensure the security of the State of Israel, and this is what we will do."

Defense Minister Barak said, "Very extensive work is being done here. We have come to see from close up how things are progressing in the operational sphere, in the struggle against terrorism, in the civilian areas under the Civil Administration and regarding relations with the Palestinians on the one hand, and with the settlements on the other. We have also come in order to hear where you stand, where you see the challenges, and in order to add our input."
