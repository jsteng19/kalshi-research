Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening, issued the following statement on the draft law in Poland:

"The law is baseless; I strongly oppose it. One cannot change history and the Holocaust cannot be denied. I have instructed the Israeli Ambassador to Poland to meet with the Polish Prime Minister this evening and express to him my strong position against the law."
