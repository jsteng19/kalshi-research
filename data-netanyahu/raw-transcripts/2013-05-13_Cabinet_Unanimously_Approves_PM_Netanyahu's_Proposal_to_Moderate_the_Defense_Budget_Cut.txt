The Cabinet, at its weekly meeting, unanimously approved Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's proposal to moderate the cut to the defense budget by NIS 1 billion without entailing a tax increase.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said at the start of the Cabinet meeting this morning that, "We need the IDF to continue becoming more efficient, but we also need additional Iron Dome batteries, and I believe that the path I am proposing today strikes a proper balance between the needs of the economy and security needs."
