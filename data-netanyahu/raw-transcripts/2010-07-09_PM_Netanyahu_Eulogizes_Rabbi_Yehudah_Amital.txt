Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today, expressed his deep sorrow over the passing of Rabbi Yehudah Amital: "The special path of Rabbi Amital – a Holocaust survivor, an illegal pre-state immigrant who was detained at Atlit, and one of the founders of the Har Etzion Yeshiva – combined Torah, work, humility and courtesy. Rabbi Amital, who also fought in the War of Independence, exemplified love of the Jewish People. He loved peace and pursued peace, loved people and brought them close to Torah. May his memory be blessed
