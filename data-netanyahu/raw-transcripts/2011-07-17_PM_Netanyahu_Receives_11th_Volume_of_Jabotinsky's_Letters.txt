Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today in his Jerusalem office, received the 11th volume of the letters of Zeev Jabotinsky, which was published by the Jabotinsky Institute and the Zionist Library. The volume was presented to the Prime Minister by Jabotinsky Institute Chairman Mordechai Sarig, Vice Chairman Amiram Bukspan, Director-General Yossi Ahimeir, Academic Committee Chairman Prof. Arye Naor and the book's editor, Dr. Moshe Halevy.

The new volume contains 360 of Jabotinsky's letters from 1936. The letters document Jabotinsky's work against the background of world and regional events, which influenced the Zionist enterprise.

Prime Minister Netanyahu was very moved to hear that letter #160 in the volume was written by Jabotinsky to his father, Prof. Ben-Zion Netanyahu. In the letter, Jabotinsky apologized that he wanted to write an article about Rabbi Nathan Malikovsky, the Prime Minister's grandfather and an ardent Zionist, but was unable to do so.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said that Jabotinsky was among the literary giants of the Jewish People in the modern era and added that, “The work that the Jabotinsky Institute is doing in publishing his letters is an important educational and cultural project for the Jewish People and Israel's heritage.”
