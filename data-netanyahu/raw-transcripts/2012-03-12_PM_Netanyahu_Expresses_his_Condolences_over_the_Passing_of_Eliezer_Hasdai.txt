Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today expressed his condolences over the passing of Eliezer Hasdai:

“I learned, a few minutes ago, about the passing of our friend Eliezer Hasdai after a difficult illness. Eliezer Hasdai was among the builders of Alfei Menashe. It was his life’s work. He was truly dedicated to it and the results are plain to see. His life was very symbolic: He was the son of Holocaust survivors. He lost his daughter in a traffic accident on the eve of her enlistment in the IDF. He struggled against the disengagement and was one of the leaders of that struggle. He went where his heart took him. We lament his passing and send our condolences to his family.”
