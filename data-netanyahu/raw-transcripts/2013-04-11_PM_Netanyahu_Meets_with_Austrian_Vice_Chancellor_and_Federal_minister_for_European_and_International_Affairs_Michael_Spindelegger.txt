Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this afternoon met with Austrian Vice Chancellor and Federal minister for European and International Affairs Michael Spindelegger.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said, "Welcome. It's good to see you again in Israel. We have a lot to talk about: The pursuit of peace; the pursuit of security; the great crisis that is enveloping our region, especially in Syria, where you have some of the world's most dangerous weapons and we cannot allow them to fall into the world's most dangerous hands â€“ there are Hezbollah, Al-Qaida and other terrorist groups. This is of great concern to us. I know it is of great concern for you as well, and I want to discuss with you now how we can work together to prevent that from happening. It's good to see you."

Minister of Strategic and Intelligence Affairs and International Relations Dr. Yuval Steinitz and Deputy Foreign Minister Zeev Elkin also attended the meeting.
