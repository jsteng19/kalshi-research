Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu calls on outstanding candidates to submit their candidacies for the post of

Civil Service Commissioner

in order to lead the reform of the public sector and improve service to citizens.

Prime Minister Netanyahu informed the Cabinet this morning (Sunday), 23.5.10, that he intends to lead structural and organizational changes in the public sector and integrate into it the internet and information revolution, in order to improve service to citizens and make it more efficient. To this end, he called on outstanding candidates, from both the public and private sectors, to submit their candidacies for the post of Civil Service Commissioner in order to be at the forefront of the implementation of this important organizational change.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said that outstanding candidates have not yet applied. Therefore, at his request, the Cabinet approved a four-month extension of the tenure of the current Civil Service Commissioner, Shmuel Hollander. The Prime Minister added that this was also necessary in order to advance legislation on the bi-annual state budget until its first Knesset reading.

Prime Minister Netanyahu asked Prime Minister's Office Director-General Eyal Gabai to examine the possibility of establishing a search committee to recommend three worthy candidates for the post of Civil Service Commissioner. The Prime Minister said that the public sector currently costs 42% of GNP and added that he intends to reduce this proportion.
