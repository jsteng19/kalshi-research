PM Netanyahu, at IDF Training Base #1, addressed an IDF officers' course graduation ceremony. Following is an excerpt from his remarks:

"I do not intend to go into detail about what we are planning vis-à-vis Gaza. The intensity will be stepped up as necessary. We are prepared for any scenario and our enemies would do well to understand this – now.

Regarding the Syrian front, we are constantly working to prevent Iranian forces and their proxies from establishing a military presence there. We will not allow those who call for our destruction to turn Syria into a base for aggression against Israel.

The iron fist of the IDF is powerfully striking whoever strives to attack us, and will continue to do so."
