Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem, met with a delegation of senior French MPs. Prime Minister Netanyahu: "It's very important that France and the rest of Europe do exactly what Argentina did recently, and that is to declare Hezbollah as a terrorist group. It's the major terrorist organization in the Middle East and in the world, and it's operating terrorists on European soil. So the most important thing is to designate Hezbollah as a terrorist organization and I think that should be done immediately."
