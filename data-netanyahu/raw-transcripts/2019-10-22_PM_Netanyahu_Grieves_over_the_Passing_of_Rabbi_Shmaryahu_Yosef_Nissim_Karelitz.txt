Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu grieves over the passing of renowned Torah scholar Rabbi Shmaryahu Yosef Nissim Karelitz, one of the giants of Jewish law in our generation. His unique personality and extraordinary expertise in Torah and Jewish law literature raised up tens of thousands of students who will continue his path out of an abiding commitment to the Jewish people and its heritage. May his soul be bound in the chain of life for all generations.
