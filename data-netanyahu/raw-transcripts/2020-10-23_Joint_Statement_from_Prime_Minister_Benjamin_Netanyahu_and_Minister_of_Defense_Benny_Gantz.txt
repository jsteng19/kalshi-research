Upon his return from Washington, Defense Minister Gantz spoke with Prime Minister Netanyahu, about his meetings in the Pentagon and the agreement he signed with Secretary Esper to secure Israel’s Qualitative Military Edge.This agreement was achieved after continuous discussions between Israel’s MOD and the Pentagon, that began after the previous visit of Defense Minister Gantz in Washington a month ago. The Defense Minister discussed the understandings reached with the United States, which will allow the procurement of advanced weapon systems that will significantly upgrade Israel’s military capabilities, maintain its security and its military advantage in the region as well as its qualitative military edge in the coming decades. During the visit, Defense Minister Gantz was notified by the US administration of its plans to notify Congress of its intention to provide certain weapon systems to the UAE. The Prime Minister and the Defense Minister both agree that since the US is upgrading Israel’s military capability and is maintaining Israel’s qualitative military edge, Israel will not oppose the sale of these systems to the UAE.
