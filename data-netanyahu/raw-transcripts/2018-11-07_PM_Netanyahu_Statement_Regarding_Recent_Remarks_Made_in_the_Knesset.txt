Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made the following statement regarding to recent remarks made in the Knesset:

"The recent statements heard in the Knesset are inappropriate and have no place in the Israeli discourse. I am in favor of vehement and sometimes even sarcastic arguments, as long as they transact with respect and relate to the matter at hand and not to a person's body. I am against offensive or chauvinist discourse that does not respect the Knesset and us as public emissaries".
