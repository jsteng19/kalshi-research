Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem, welcomed US Vice President Mike Pence in a ceremony with an honor guard. The two met privately and then held an expanded meeting with their entourages.

Prime Minister Netanyahu made the following remarks at the start of the meeting:

"Mr. Vice President, I’ve had the privilege over the years of standing here with hundreds of world leaders and welcome them, all of them to Israel’s capital, Jerusalem.

This is the first time that I’m standing when both leaders can say those three words, “Israel’s capital, Jerusalem.”

I want to thank President Trump and you for that historic statement, which I know you supported and championed.

I look forward to discussing with you, as we’ve just begun, how to further strengthen our remarkable alliance—it’s never been stronger—and how to advance peace and security in our region, which is our common aim.

And I welcome you, dear friend, to Jerusalem. Welcome."
