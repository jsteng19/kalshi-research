;Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today is currently meeting with US President Joe Biden at the White House.

Before their meeting, the Prime Minister signed the guestbook in the Roosevelt Room.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

Mr. President, we've known each other for 40 years, and you've known every prime minister for 50 years, since Golda Meir.

So, from a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish-American Zionist â€“ I thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the State of Israel.

I look forward to discussing with you today and working with you in the months ahead on the great issues before us."
