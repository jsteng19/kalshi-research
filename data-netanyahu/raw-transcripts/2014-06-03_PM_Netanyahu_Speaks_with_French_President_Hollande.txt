Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this afternoon, spoke with French President Francois Hollande and expressed his appreciation for the vigorous action by the French security forces in bringing about the capture of the terrorist suspected of perpetrating the anti-Semitic attack in Brussels. The Prime Minister told the French President that he appreciates the latter's strong and consistent stand against anti-Semitism.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said that the Palestinian unity government with backing from the Hamas terrorist organization is a Palestinian step against peace and in favor of terrorism and that, therefore, it would be a mistake to grant it legitimacy. The Prime Minister added that no European country would be prepared to accept a terrorist organization as part of its government.
