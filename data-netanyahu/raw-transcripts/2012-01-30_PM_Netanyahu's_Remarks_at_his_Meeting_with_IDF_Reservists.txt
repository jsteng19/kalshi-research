Following is an excerpt from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks today, at his meeting with a group of IDF reservists:

"A solution to sharing the burden is necessary, one that does not tear society apart. It is possible to do this without setting public against public. When talking about sharing the burden, it should be recalled that as Finance Minister, I led the cut in child support payments, which led to a revolution in bringing the ultra-orthodox public into the labor force. There is a not inconsiderable amount of hypocrisy on the part of those who visited your tent, after they automatically voted in favor of extending the Tal Law for five years. This Government is doing things that previous governments did not do: Dealing with infiltrators, free education from age 3, a revolution in housing and more. We are changing priorities and are working on the understanding that things need to be changed including this."
