Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expresses sorrow on

the passing – last night – of jurist Prof. Zeev Segal

: "It was with sorrow and pain that I heard about the passing of Zeev Segal, one of Israel's foremost jurists. Zeev was an exemplary figure, a journalist who struggled to advance democracy, human rights and the rule of law. I saw his work at Tel Aviv University up close and the high regard in which he was held by his students and thousands of jurists around the world. His influence as a jurist, along with his work as a legal commentator, advanced public discourse and freedom of expression in Israeli society."
