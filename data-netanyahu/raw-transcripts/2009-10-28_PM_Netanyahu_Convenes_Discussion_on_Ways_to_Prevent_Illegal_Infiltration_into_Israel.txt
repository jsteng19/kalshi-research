Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this evening (Wednesday), 28.10.09, convened a discussion on ways to prevent illegal infiltration into Israel, as part of a comprehensive discussion on the issue of foreign workers.

Finance Minister Yuval Steinitz, Interior Minister Eli Yishai, Public Security Minister Yitzhak Aharonovitch, Strategic Affairs Minister Moshe Yaalon and senior officials from the Defense, Foreign Affairs and Justice ministries, as well as from the IDF, participated in the discussion.

Following the meeting, Prime Minister Netanyahu decided as follows:

1. The Public Security, Interior and Justice ministries will – within two weeks – formulate a plan to increase punitive and enforcement measures against employers.

2. The Defense, Transportation, and Public Security ministries will present various alternatives for building a fence and barrier against infiltrators, along the southern border. Among the alternatives will be a pilot project in a small area followed by construction of the overall fence in phases over a period of several years.

Discussion on the issue of the children of foreign workers will continue in the coming days.
