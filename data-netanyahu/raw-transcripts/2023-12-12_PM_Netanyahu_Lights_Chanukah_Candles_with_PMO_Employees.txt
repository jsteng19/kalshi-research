Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, together with Prime Minister's Office (PMO) Director General Yossi Shelley, lit Chanukah candles with PMO employees, at the PMO in Jerusalem.

Prime Minister Netanyahu wished the employees a happy Chanukah and said:

"I know that this joy is mixed with sadness. Behind us here, are photos of four sons of PMO employees who fell in our very just and vital war, and we are celebrating Chanukah today. Four sons of the Maccabees, the sons of the Hasmoneans, fell in battle with the enemy. We know that we are in the same fight for the continued existence of the Jewish people, for the thread of our existence.

I would like to thank each and every one of you for the important work that you are doing at this time in order to ensure the continuation of the eternal Israel. Just as we did in those days, so we are doing at this time.

May you all have a happy holiday."
