Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, responded to the UN Human Rights Council decision:

"The UN Human Rights Council is not interested in the facts and is not really interested in human rights.

On the day on which Israel was fired at from Sinai, and at a time when ISIS is committing vicious terrorist attacks in Egypt, as Assad slaughters his people in Syria and as the number of arbitrary executions per annum climbs in Iran – the UN Human Rights Council decides to condemn the State of Israel for no fault of its own, for acting to defend itself from a murderous terrorist organization.

Israel is a stable democracy in the Middle East that upholds equal rights for all its citizens and acts in accordance with international law.

Those who fear to openly attack terrorism will – in the end – be attacked by terrorism.

The council that has hitherto adopted more decisions against Israel than against all other countries cannot call itself a human rights council.

The State of Israel will continue to defend its citizens against those who call for its destruction and take daily action to achieve this goal."
