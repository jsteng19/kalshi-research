Following are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahuâ€™s remarks at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting today:

"Good morning. Last Friday,

an arch-terrorist who organized many attacks against the State of Israel was eliminated

. He was in the midst of planning another attack that was directed at our southern border with Egypt. We are still on alert regarding the attack and I have ordered the closure of the road on the Egyptian border.

But there is no doubt that IDF operations have disrupted the organizing for the attack; of course, time will tell to what extent. Naturally, this led to

another round with the Popular Resistance Committees, Islamic Jihad and other groups

We are still in the midst of this round

. The IDF is striking at them in strength. I would like to commend this operation and the security and intelligence services. We have exacted from them a very high price; naturally, we will act as necessary.

I must also point out that

the Iron Dome system has proven itself very well

and we will, of course, see to its expansion in the months and years ahead. We will do everything in our power to expand the deployment of this system. In the end, the strongest force at our disposal is the fortitude of the residents, of the council heads, of Israelis and of the Government. We are taking the necessary defensive and aggressive measures and I have no doubt that with this combination, along with the necessary fortitude, we will overcome these terrorist threats around us. Thank you."
