Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife, along with – inter alia – former Health Minister Yaakov Litzman and Assuta Chairman Shuki Shemer attended the launch of Assuta Hospital in Ashdod. Following is an excerpt from the Prime Minister's remarks:

"Today is a very important day in Israel and outside Israel.

Jerusalem is the capital of Israel whether the UN recognizes it or not.

It took 70 years for the US to officially recognize it and it will take more years until the UN also recognizes it.

Attitudes toward Israel by many countries in the world, on all continents, are changing outside the walls of the UN and in the end will percolate inside the walls of the UN building – the house of lies.

The State of Israel flatly rejects this vote even before it is held. Jerusalem is our capital. We will continue to build in it and foreign embassies, led by the US embassy, will move to Jerusalem. It will happen.

Thank you President Trump and Ambassador Haley for standing up for Israel and for standing up for the truth. Ultimately the truth will prevail."
