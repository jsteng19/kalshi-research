Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, toured the IDF General Staff multi-system and multi-dimensional 'Lethal Arrow' exercise in the north, together with IDF Chief-of-Staff Lt.-Gen. Aviv Kochavi, GOC Intelligence Maj.-Gen. Tamir Heyman and senior IDF officers. Prime Minister Netanyahu, at the conclusion of the exercise: "Even during the coronavirus, our enemies are not stagnant and neither are we. In this exercise I have been impressed by the vast improvement in the IDF's offensive capabilities and Hezbollah and Lebanon would do well to take this into account. Whoever attacks us will meet firepower and a steel fist that will destroy any enemy."
