Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening: "I am attentive to your pain. I hear your cries. Today, I reached agreement with the Finance Minister on a special channeling of NIS 2 billion to the self-employed, small businesses and medium businesses in the framework of the NIS 100 billion that we have decided on – to ensure that the money reaches you and reaches you quicker. Also, I sat today with an international economic team to decide on the most important things – how to put forward an economic plan that will ensure growth, your jobs and your livelihood. We are constantly working for you."
