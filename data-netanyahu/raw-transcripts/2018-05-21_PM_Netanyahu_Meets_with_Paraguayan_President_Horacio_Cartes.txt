Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem, met with Paraguayan President Horacio Cartes. The two met privately and then held an expanded meeting with their entourages. Among the subjects discussed were diplomatic and economic issues and strengthening agricultural, economic and commercial cooperation between the two countries.

"Welcome my friend. It's a pleasure to welcome President Cartes to Jerusalem on this historic day. You've been leading in so many areas and now you are also among the leaders who have put their embassy in Jerusalem, which has been the capital of our people for only 3,000 years. And you are a great friend and we welcome you in this spirit of deep friendship, a friendship from the heart."

[Translated from the Hebrew]

"I am very moved by the decision of Paraguayan President Horacio Cartes to move Paraguay's embassy to Jerusalem. We have met several times. He told me 'I want to do this.' I told him 'Do it.' He did it. In a few weeks he will conclude his term of office and he told me 'Before the end of my term, as an expression of the friendship between Israel and Paraguay, I will move the embassy.' He spoke and he did. You have our heartfelt thanks."
