Following are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks on the occasion of Hebrew Book Week:

"Recently, I found myself rereading my late father's book The Founding Fathers of Zionism, which takes me back to the foundations of the movement that established the State of Israel â€“ five giants whom every boy and girl in Israel should know because we all stand on their shoulders.

Everything that I read here is being implemented today. What has yet to be implemented, that is what I am reading about.

When I was a boy, I read, and afterwards, when I was a young man, I read more, and as an adult, I read even more. I think that reading and writing books are the foundations of culture. We are "the People of the Book." I know that we are also the people of the Internet, but at the heart of it, we are the People of the Book.

I would like to encourage all of you to read, for both enjoyment and education. Both characterize our people and will continue to do so."
