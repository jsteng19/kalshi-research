Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem, spoke to the heads of Israeli missions in the Asia-Pacific region:

"The largest markets are in Asia. I want this to find expression in the expansion of Israel's ties with India and China. I have agreed with Foreign Ministry Director General Yuval Rotem to set up two new divisions in the ministry: The China Division and the India Division. This shows the continuing importance that we place on these two major powers. There is much work to do and there are walls of bureaucracy that must be cracked and this is very, very important.

We must continue to tighten these links on the basis of our interest in opening new markets and developing products. A major portion of the world's population is located in the Asia-Pacific region. This is a rising power. We are moving toward a global market economy and a technological revolution."
