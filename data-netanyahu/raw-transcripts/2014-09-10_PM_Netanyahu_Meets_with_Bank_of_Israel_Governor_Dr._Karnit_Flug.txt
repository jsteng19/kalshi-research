Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this morning, met with Bank of Israel Governor Dr. Karnit Flug ahead of the launch of the new NIS 50 note and told her at the start of the meeting, " In order for this note to retain its value, we must guard both security and the economy. I very much appreciate your seriousness and professionalism and of the Bank of Israel staff in maintaining the stability of the Israeli economy. This is one of our two missions. We must increase the security budget due to Operation Protective Edge and guard the economy, and these items meet in the deficit which we can control and which will not topple us. This will be our policy and thus we will act, together."

Bank of Israel Governor Dr. Flug replied, "I am pleased to hear these remarks and I thank you. The new NIS 50 note bears the likeness of Shaul Tchernikovsky .It is unique both in its design and in its security technology, among the most advanced in the world. I thank the Prime Minister for supporting the process and am pleased to present the new NIS 50 note to the citizens of Israel."
