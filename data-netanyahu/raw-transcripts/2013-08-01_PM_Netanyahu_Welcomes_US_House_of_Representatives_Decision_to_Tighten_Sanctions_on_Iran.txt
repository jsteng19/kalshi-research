Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcomes the U.S. House of Representatives' decision to tighten sanctions on Iran:

"Following the Iranian elections the House of Representatives has sent a clear message to the Iranian regime that international pressure will increase until Iran meets its obligations and ceases its pursuit of a nuclear weapons capability. We will judge Iran by its actions alone."

On Wednesday, the House of Representatives, with overwhelming bipartisan support, passed a bill 400 to 20 tightening U.S. sanctions on Iran's petroleum sector.
