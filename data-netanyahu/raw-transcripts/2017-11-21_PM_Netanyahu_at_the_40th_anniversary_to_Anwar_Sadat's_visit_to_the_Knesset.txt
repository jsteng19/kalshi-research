"I have now met with the Egyptian ambassador to Israel, Hazem Khairat and his team.

He gave me greetings from Egyptian President Abd al-Fattah al-Sisi and Foreign Minister Shukri, and I congratulated him on this important occasion.

The peace between Israel and Egypt is robust, it is strategic peace benefitting both countries.

At his speech at the Knesset, Sadat spoke clearly:

"We do not want to surround you, or that you surround us with missiles meant to destroy, or with bombs of hatred and enmity. I have declared more than once that Israel is an existing fact.

This was the first step towards the peace treaty formulated In Camp David: a clear recognition of Israel.

This is what Sadat did, unlike our Palestinian neighbors who to this day refuse to recognize our nation state.

Sadly I say: I have yet to encounter a "Palestinian Sadat" that will declare his will to end the conflict, recognize the state of Israel with any borders, and support our right to live in peace and security. "
