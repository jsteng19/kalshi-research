Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this morning, toured the Great Wall of China.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said, "Last night I spoke with President Obama just like I have been speaking with China's leaders over the past few days and just like I spoke to President Putin a few days ago, and I discussed with them a range of bilateral and international issues."

Prime Minister Netanyahu added, "Just like the Chinese protected themselves and defended themselves with the Great Wall, so we will continue to defend ourselves on the southern border, the Golan Heights and on all fronts."
