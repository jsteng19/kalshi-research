Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today:

"I hear the anguish of the hostages' families who have lost what is dearest to them.

My wife and I go to heart-rending meetings, that are simply heart-breaking. I hear. I listen. I also do not judge. I am doing everything to return the hostages and to win the war."
