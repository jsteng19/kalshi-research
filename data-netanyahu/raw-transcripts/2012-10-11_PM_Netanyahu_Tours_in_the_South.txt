Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, toured the Israeli-Egyptian border fence, the construction of which is being completed. IDF Deputy Chief-of-Staff Maj.-Gen. Yair Naveh, GOC Southern Command Maj.-Gen. Tal Russo, the area division commander and the director of the fence construction project briefed the Prime Minister on counter-terrorism operations and actions to block infiltration. (Five infiltrators have crossed the border since the beginning of October; all have been arrested.)

Prime Minister Netanyahu praised the work that has led to results in the field. "We are taking determined action to defend our borders both on land, as we are doing here with the fence, which has blocked infiltrators and is blocking terrorism, and in the air, as we did over the weekend when we foiled an attempt by Hezbollah. We will continue to take vigorous action against all threats," the Prime Minister said.
