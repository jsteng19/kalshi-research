US President Barack Obama this afternoon telephoned Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to express his condolences on the passing of his father, Prof. Ben-Zion Netanyahu. The President said, "Michelle and I wish to express our deep sorrow at the passing of your father. I can only imagine how proud he was to see you, as the leader of the State of Israel. It was a great gift for him. I want you to know that we are thinking of you and your family at this time. Your father was a figure who was larger than life."

US President Obama added, "The significant role he played in the life of the nation and your family only makes the loss more significant. He was a remarkable man who dedicated his life to the Jewish people and served as a bridge between Israel and the US."

Prime Minister Netanyahu thanked the President and his wife, and said, "I appreciate your words. He was a wonderful father and a great man. This is a big loss for me. No matter how long you live, it is always too short. Even if you think you are ready to separate from your parents, you are never really prepared for it."
