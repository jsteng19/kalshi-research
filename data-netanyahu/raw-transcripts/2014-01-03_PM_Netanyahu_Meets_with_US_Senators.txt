Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in his Jerusalem office, met with US Senators John McCain (R-AZ), Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and John Barrasso (R-WY). At the start of the meeting, the Prime Minister said, "I want to thank the Senators for their support, for the support of the American government, for the Arrow program. We had today a successful launch. This is a great advance in Israel's ability to protect itself against ballistic missiles. We need a lot of protection in this area because there are bad regimes led by Iran, and terrorist proxies who have missiles that are periodically fired against us. We protect ourselves by having the ability to fight back but also by having the ability to defend ourselves. That is what Arrow is for and I thank you for it."
