Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, at IDF Gaza Division HQ, held an assessment of the security situation. Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman, IDF Chief-of-Staff Lt.-Gen. Gadi Eisenkot, ISA Director Nadav Argaman, National Security Council Director Meir Ben-Shabbat and other senior officials also attended.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"Today is the fourth anniversary of when the late Hadar Goldin fell in action. We are committed to bringing him and Oron Shaul, and the two civilians, back to the State of Israel.

I visited Sderot yesterday and I saw the iron wall of their civilian determination and today I am visiting the IDF here, together with the Defense Minister, the Chief-of-Staff, GOC Southern Command and the Director of the ISA. I saw our military iron wall.

We are in a campaign that entails an exchange of blows and I can tell you that the IDF is ready for any scenario. I was very impressed by what I saw here and I know that like me, every Israeli citizen believes in the IDF and gives it their backing ahead of any possible development."

In response to the question ''Do you [plural] believe that it is possible to resolve the crisis without an extensive campaign?" Prime Minister Netanyahu replied: "I believe that we are doing the right things. It would be worthwhile to pay attention, not only to what we are saying, but to what we are doing."
