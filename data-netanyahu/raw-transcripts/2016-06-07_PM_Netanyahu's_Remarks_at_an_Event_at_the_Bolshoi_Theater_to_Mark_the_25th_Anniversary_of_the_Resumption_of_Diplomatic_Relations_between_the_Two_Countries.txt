Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this evening made the following remark at an event at the Bolshoi Theater to mark the 25th anniversary of the resumption of diplomatic relations between the two countries:

"We are threatened by the forces of barbarism. They threaten every enlightened society on earth. They cut off heads and destroy cultural treasures. We know that we need to unite in order to save human civilization from them. We spoke about this at length and here as well our partnership stems from that same basic and deep link of common values.

I would like to thank you again for the major role you have taken upon yourself in strengthening ties between our two countries. I am certain that in another 25 years when they look back they will remember this evening as a milestone between Russia and Israel."
