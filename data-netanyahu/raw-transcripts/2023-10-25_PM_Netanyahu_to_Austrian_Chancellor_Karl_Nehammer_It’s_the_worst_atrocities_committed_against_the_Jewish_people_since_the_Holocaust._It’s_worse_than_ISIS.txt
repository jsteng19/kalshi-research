Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, at the Kirya in Tel Aviv, met with Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer.

Prime Minister Netanyahu at the start of the meeting:

"I thank you, Chancellor, for coming here. You’ve expressed unqualified support for Israel. It’s our darkest hour, and your support is important. Because this is a battle of civilization against barbarism, and Israel is fighting the battle for civilization, which I know you support. Thank you for coming here.

Austrian Chancellor Nehammer:

"Absolutely. That’s the reason why I am here, also as my Prime Minister colleague from the Czech Republic, because we stand on the side of Israel. We have the same and share the same values. And the joint fight against terrorism is now more important than ever."

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"This is barbarism. It’s the worst atrocities committed against the Jewish people since the Holocaust. It’s worse than ISIS."

"Yes. It’s unbelievable. So we have to fight."
