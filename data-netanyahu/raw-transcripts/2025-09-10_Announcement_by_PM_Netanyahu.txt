Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu:

"Today, hostage Elizabeth Tsurkov – an Israeli citizen who was abducted in Iraq in March 2023 – was released.

In staff work directed by Coordinator for the Hostages and the Missing Brig.-Gen. (Res.) Gal Hirsch, which continued for many months, and following many efforts, we succeeded in bringing about her release.

This evening I had an emotional conversation with her mother and Avital, Elizabeth's sister, and I told them that the entire people of Israel was happy to see her return home.

We will continue to fight with vigor and determination until we bring back all of our hostages, the living and the deceased."
