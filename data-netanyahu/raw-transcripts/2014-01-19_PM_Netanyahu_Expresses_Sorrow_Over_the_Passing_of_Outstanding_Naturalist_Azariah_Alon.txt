Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, expressed his sorrow over the passing of Azariah Alon, one of the founders of the Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel and an outstanding naturalist. "Like many, I grew up listening to Azariah Alon's wonderful radio spots in which he described our country's beautiful places, flora and fauna. I read his books and articles. His words were always clear and full of content and knowledge. Azariah came from a well-rooted Zionist and Israeli family. He was born in Ukraine, came to Israel and settled in the Jezreel Valley, and afterwards in Beit Hashita. He was one of the founders of the Society for the Protection of Nature and an Israel Prize laureate. He symbolized love of nature and the environment. Azariah Alon influenced many people in love of the country â€“ as a teacher and as a guide. On behalf of the government and people of Israel, I send my condolences to his family. May his memory be for a blessing," the Prime Minister said.
