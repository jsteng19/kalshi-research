Prime Minister Netanyahu spoke by telephone with French President Emanuel Macron. Prime Minister Netanyahu commended French President Macron for his leadership on the issue of Lebanon and expressed Israel's willingness to render humanitarian assistance, all of which would go directly to the population. Prime Minister Netanyahu pointed out that in order to prevent disasters like the one that occurred at Beirut port, the explosives and missiles that Hezbollah has hidden must be removed from all concentrations of civilian population in Lebanon. Prime Minister Netanyahu made it clear that Hezbollah is sorely mistaken if thinks it can solve the crisis in Lebanon by creating a crisis with Israel.
