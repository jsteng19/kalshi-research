Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, made the following remarks at the start of his meeting with Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko:

"ISA Director Yoram Cohen and his people are doing important and excellent work for the people of Israel and for the security of Israel. I find the attacks on them to be unacceptable.

We are a nation of law.

All ISA activity is carried out according to the law and this activity is being carried out under the close supervision and approval of the Attorney General, the Justice Ministry and the courts.

There is Arab terrorism that we are dealing with and are fighting night and day, everywhere, but, to my regret, there are – from time to time – acts of terrorism that are carried out by Jews and the ISA is also dealing with them. Terrorism from any quarter is unacceptable to us."
