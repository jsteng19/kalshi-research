Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this evening said that he is interested in meeting with the Chairman of the Palestinian Authority, in New York. "I call on the Chairman of the Palestinian Authority to open direct negotiations in New York, which would continue in Jerusalem and Ramallah. I propose to President Abbas to begin peace negotiations instead of wasting time on futile unilateral measures," the Prime Minister said.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said that unilateral measures are not the way to advance peace between us and added that the way to achieve peace is through direct negotiations and not via declarations at the UN.
