"I conferred here today in Sochi, on the Black Sea, for about three hours with President Vladimir Putin. Most of the discussion dealt with Iran's attempt to establish a foothold in Syria in the places where ISIS was defeated and is leaving. The victory over ISIS is welcome. Iran's entry is unwelcome, endangering us, and in my opinion, endangering the region and the world.

I spoke to President Putin very clearly about our positions on this matter and the fact that this is unacceptable to us. I can say about previous meetings with President Putin that any such conversation served the security of Israel and Israeli interests and I believe Russia's interests as well. Based on today's conversation today, I think I can say the same things vis-Ã -vis Russia."
