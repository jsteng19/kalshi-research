Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem, met with UK Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary Dominic Raab. Prime Minister Netanyahu told UK Foreign Secretary Raab that he expects Britain to change its policy towards Iran and that it should join the American sanctions in order to prevent Iran from arming itself with lethal weapons or to advance towards a nuclear weapon. The Prime Minister said, "Look at Iran's aggression today, without a nuclear weapon. What a huge danger Iran would be to the entire world if it did get a nuclear weapon."
