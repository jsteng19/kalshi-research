Prime Minister Benjamin commented on the publication – by researchers at Shanghai Jiao Tong University– of the 2012 Academic Ranking of World Universities in which six Israeli universities are ranked, four of which (Hebrew University, the Technion, the Weizmann Institute of Science and Tel Aviv University) are ranked among the top 150 universities in the world.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said: "This ranking proves that our Government's unprecedented investment in Israeli academia has led to results. We are investing NIS 7 billion in universities, in a multi-year plan, in centers of excellence, in bringing Israeli minds back home, and our efforts are bearing fruit. I am especially happy over the high ranking of Israeli institutions in computer science – with four Israeli universities among the 30 leading institutions in the world. This is another sign that Israel is continuing to establish itself as a global high-tech power. My Government will continue to invest in education – from pre-school to higher education."
