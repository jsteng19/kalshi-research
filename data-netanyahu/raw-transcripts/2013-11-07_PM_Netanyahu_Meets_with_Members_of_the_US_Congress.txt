Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening met with a visiting delegation of members of the US Congress and told them, "If the news that I am receiving of the impending proposal by the P5+1 is true, this is the deal of the century, for Iran. Because Iran is essentially giving nothing and it's getting all the air taken out, the air begins to be taken out of the pressure cooker that it took years to build in the sanctions regime. What we're having today is a situation that Iran is giving up, at best, a few days of enrichment time, but the whole international regime's sanctions policy has the air taken out of it. That's a big mistake, it will relieve all the pressure inside Iran, it is a historic mistake, a grievous historic error".
