The Prime Minister's Office Communications Department has recently launched a new YouTube channel with videos in Hebrew and English, including Prime Minister Netanyahu's speeches and trips.

The PMO Communications Department and the PMO National Information Directorate have also begun updating the PMO Facebook, Twitter and Flickr accounts, as well as integrating them onto the general PMO website.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said that, "Today, social media channels are more vital than ever for Israel's public diplomacy efforts, for administrative transparency and for providing citizens with updated information."

Prime Minister Netanyahu has directed that these media be used during his upcoming trip to Washington in order to pass along updates and current information.
