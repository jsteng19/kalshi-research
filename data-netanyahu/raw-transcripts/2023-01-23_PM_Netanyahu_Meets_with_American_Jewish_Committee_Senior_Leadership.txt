Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening, at the Knesset, met with a delegation from the American Jewish Committee (AJC) Executive Council. The Prime Minister explained the danger that Iran poses for the region and the entire world by developing nuclear weapons and stressed the goal that Iran not become a nuclear state needs to be a shared goal of Israel and the US. Prime Minister Netanyahu also stated the importance of expanding the Abraham Accords and said that expanding them will promote regional stability. The Prime Minister thanked the AJC leaders for their activity on behalf of Jews around the world and for strengthening the very important bond between Israel and the US. Also participating in the meeting were AJC CEO Ted Deutch, AJC President Michael Tichnor and the Chairman of both the AJC Board of Governors and Hillel International, Matthew Bronfman.
