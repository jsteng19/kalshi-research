Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a short time ago this evening (Thursday, 29 November 2012), spoke with Israeli Ambassador to the UN Ron Prosor and praised the latter's speech to the UN General Assembly. "I am proud of you. You presented the truth regarding the State of Israel. This was a speech of facts, as opposed to Abu Mazen's venomous speech," the Prime Minister said.
