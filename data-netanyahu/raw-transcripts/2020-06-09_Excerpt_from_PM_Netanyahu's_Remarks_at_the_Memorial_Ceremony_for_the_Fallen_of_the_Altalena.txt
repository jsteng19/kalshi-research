Following is an excerpt from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks, at the memorial ceremony for the fallen of the Altalena, at the Nachalat Yitzhak cemetery in Tel Aviv:

"The quick action that we took to save lives was designed for the good of all citizens of Israel. In the midst of a global crisis, I emphasized countless times that the fight against the virus required mutual responsibility, trust and brotherhood. We are still dependent on this mutual responsibility because the pandemic is here and it is again raising its head. It requires every one of us to follow the instructions of the Health Ministry – as we are doing here today – and it could be that soon we will have to take additional steps in addition to the steps we are taking to open the economy, put people back to work and help the self-employed."
