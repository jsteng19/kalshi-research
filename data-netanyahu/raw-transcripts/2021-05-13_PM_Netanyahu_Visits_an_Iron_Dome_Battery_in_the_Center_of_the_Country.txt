Prime Minister Netanyahu visited an Iron Dome battery in the center of the country. Prime Minister Netanyahu: "I am here at one of the Iron Dome batteries. The commanders and soldiers are doing extraordinary work in defending the skies and citizens of Israel. Achieving 100% is impossible but they are getting pretty close to it and we all appreciate this twice over: Defensively and offensively. The defensive actions of Iron Dome batteries give us space to mount attacks. The IDF has already attacked hundreds of targets and we will soon pass 1,000. We are continuing to strike Hamas while defending our citizens. It will take time but with great decisiveness, both defensively and offensively, we will achieve our goal â€“ to restore quiet to the State of Israel." Prime Minister Netanyahu was briefed at the site by air defense commander Brig.-Gen. Gilad Biran, 127th Battalion commander Lt.-Col. Maor Gavriel and battery commander Capt. Asaf Ohana. After the briefing, Prime Minister Netanyahu spoke with the Iron Dome battery soldiers who told him about the operational activity. The Prime Minister thanked them for their contribution to the security of the residents of Israel.
