Following is an excerpt from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks, today, in Sderot at the signing ceremony for the city roof agreement:

"The first thing that is happening here may be summarized in one word – security: Security for Sderot, security for the area adjacent to the Gaza Strip, security for the Negev, security for Israel, security in the future.

We have one clear and simple rule and we seek to express it constantly: If someone tries to attack you – rise up and attack him. We will not allow, here on the Gaza border, them to hurt us. We will hurt them.

Security in the present is a necessary condition for security in the future and what we have here today is a powerful expression for our future security."
