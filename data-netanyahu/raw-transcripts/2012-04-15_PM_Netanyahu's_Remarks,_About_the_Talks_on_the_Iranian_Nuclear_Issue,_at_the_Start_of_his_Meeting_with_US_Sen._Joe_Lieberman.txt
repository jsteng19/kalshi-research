Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made the following remarks, about the talks on the Iranian nuclear issue, earlier today at the start of his meeting with US Senator (ID-CT) Joe Lieberman:

"My initial impression is that Iran has been given a 'freebie.' It has got five weeks to continue enrichment without any limitation, any inhibition. I think Iran should take immediate steps to stop all enrichment, take out all enrichment material and dismantle the nuclear facility in Qom. I believe that the world's greatest practitioner of terrorism must not have the opportunity to develop atomic bombs."
