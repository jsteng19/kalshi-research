Following the incident in the south, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held an assessment of the situation along with Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan and Israel Police Insp.-Gen. Roni Alsheich. The Prime Minister was updated on the ramming attack and the events surrounding the demolition of the illegal structures in the Negev.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"I send condolences to the family of the anti-terror unit policeman, the late Erez Amedi. Erez was an outstanding policeman, the son of a policeman, and he was murdered this morning in a ramming attack. This is the second ramming attack in a few days.

We are fighting this murderous phenomenon, which has struck both Israel and the world. The State of Israel is, above all, a nation of law in which there will be equal enforcement. Not only will this incident not deter us, it will strengthen us. It will strengthen our determination to enforce the law everywhere.

I ask everyone, especially members of the Knesset, to be responsible, to stop fanning emotions and inciting toward violence. The Bedouin public is part of us; we want to integrate it into Israeli society and not radicalize it and push it away from the center of our life experience. The police are operating on the ground with authority and nobody has the right to interfere with their mission."
