From the Prime Minister’s Office:

The claims posted by a Fox News correspondent are false.

Below are quotes from summaries of Prime Minister Netanyahu’s meetings with President Trump on February 17, 2017 (by Jacob Nagel):

From the meeting in the Oval Office

“5. The embassy – the PM supports moving it.”

From the lunch meeting at the White House

“The PM was asked about the embassy and explained [that moving it] would not lead to bloodshed in the region, as some were trying to intimidate [President Trump] into believing.”

From a summary of a meeting between Ambassador Dermer and National Security Advisor-designate Flynn on January 16, 2017 (by Jacob Nagel):

“[Dermer] explained why moving the embassy would help advance peace and not the opposite.

This would send the message that we are in Jerusalem to stay. Moving the embassy would force the other side to contend with the lie they’ve constructed – that Israel has no connection to Jerusalem – and will cause them to understand that Israel will be here forever with Jerusalem as its capital.”

This is the clear and consistent position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, which he reiterated today.
