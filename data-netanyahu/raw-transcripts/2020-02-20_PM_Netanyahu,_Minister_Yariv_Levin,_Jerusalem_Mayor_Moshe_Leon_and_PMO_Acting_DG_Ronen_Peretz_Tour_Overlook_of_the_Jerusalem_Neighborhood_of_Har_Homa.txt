Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Minister Yariv Levin, Jerusalem Mayor Moshe Leon and Prime Minister’s Office Acting Director General Ronen Peretz, today, toured an overlook of the Jerusalem neighborhood of Har Homa. Following are excerpts from Prime Minister Netanyahu’s remarks: “We are going to build the Givat Hamatos neighborhood; we have removed all of the impediments. We are approving the construction of 4,000 residential units – 1,000 residential units for the expansion of the Beit Safafa neighborhood. The Arab residents have a housing problem for which we are providing a solution, and another 3,000 residential units for Jewish residents. I must say 1,000 of these will be put on the market immediately, in the coming days, by PMO Acting Director General Ronen Peretz.” “Today, I announce the establishment of Har Homa Heh, a neighborhood in which we will build 2,200 residential units. This is another approximately 12,000 residents. Har Homa will be a neighborhood with around 50,000 residents. This is like an average-sized city in Israel, just in this neighborhood here. We did this then in the face of strong international opposition. We overcame every obstacle and we did it, and see what we have done in Jerusalem. We are connecting Jerusalem. We are connecting all parts of the united Jerusalem, the rebuilt Jerusalem. It is a source of great pride and is great news for the entire people of Israel.”
