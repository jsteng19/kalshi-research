Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this morning, at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting, made the following remarks: â€œAs has happened on previous occasions in forming a government, I intend to ask for an extension from the President. Not only is such an extension customary, it is also necessary in light of scheduling constraints stemming from the many events this time: The intermediate days of Passover, Holocaust Martyrs' and Heroes' Remembrance Day, Remembrance Day for the Fallen of Israel's Wars, Independence Day and the security events regarding the Gaza Strip. This week we will mark one year since the opening of the US Embassy in Jerusalem. The official residence of the US Ambassador is also moving to Jerusalem; thus, in effect, the Congressional decision will be implemented. We very much appreciate this historic decision by President Trump, just as we very much appreciate his historic decision to recognize Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights. I promised that we would establish a community named after President Trump. I would like to inform you that we have already selected a site on the Golan Heights where this new community will be established, and we have started the process. I will submit a decision for official approval by the new government once it is formed. We stand before an additional event and this is today's opening in Israel of the Eurovision festivities. First of all, I wish great success to all of the participants and may the best one win, and of course may that be Kobi Marimi."
