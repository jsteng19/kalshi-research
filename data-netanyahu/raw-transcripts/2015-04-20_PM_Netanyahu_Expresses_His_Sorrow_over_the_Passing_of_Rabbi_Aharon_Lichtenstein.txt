Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed his sorrow over the passing of

Rabbi Aharon Lichtenstein

. "Rabbi Lichtenstein's knowledge found expression in his literary works. He served generations of students. When I gave him the Israel Prize a year ago, I saw before my eyes a great rabbi, teacher and educator, a Zionist man, sharp witted and a keen thinker. Rabbi Lichtenstein will be remembered as a Zionist-Torah leader of the highest order, who raised thousands of students at the

Har Etzion Yeshiva

in in the

Gush Etzion community of Alon Shvut

. He loved the Land of Israel, the People of Israel and the Torah of Israel," the Prime Minister said.
