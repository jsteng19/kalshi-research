PM Netanyahu welcomes the decision of the Be'er Sheva District Court to cancel the shortening of the prison sentence of the person involved in the murder of Hadas Malka:

"This is the correct decision. Murderers and their accomplices need to be punished severely and to serve their sentences in full."
