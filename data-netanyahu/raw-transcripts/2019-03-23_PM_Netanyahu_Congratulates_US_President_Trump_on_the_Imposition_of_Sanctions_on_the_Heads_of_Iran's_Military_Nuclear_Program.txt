Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu congratulates US President Donald Trump, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Adviser John Bolton on imposing sanctions on the heads of Iran's military nuclear program in wake of the exposing of the Iranian nuclear archive. Prime Minister Netanyahu: "Iran continues to deceive the international community and lie to the world about its military nuclear program. The Iranian regime continues to conceal its capabilities and to strive for nuclear weapons. Iran endangers the peace of the Middle East and the entire world and must be blocked." Prime Minister Netanyahu will discuss the issue with President Trump at their meeting on Monday.
