Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this morning, at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting, made the following remarks: “We are in a very sensitive and volatile security period on several fronts – north, east and south. Immediately after the firing at the area adjacent to the Gaza Strip, I convened a discussion of the security leadership at the Defense Ministry. I ordered that we attack a series of objectives; therefore, the air force attacked them. You could certainly be impressed by the power of the assault. It must be understood that as far as we are concerned, Hamas is responsible for every attack originating from the territory of the Gaza Strip. I do not intend to go into detail here about our plans. We will continue to take action on all fronts for the security of the State of Israel, both openly and covertly, on land, sea, and in the air. We will continue our efforts to return our captives and MIAs. I want to say on this issue that I have full confidence in Yaron Bloom who is doing his work in a credible, serious and professional manner. I would like to add something else. We will not tolerate the throwing of stones or any other attack against IDF soldiers who are carrying out their work, doing their duty and protecting all of us in Judea and Samaria, and everywhere else in the country.”
