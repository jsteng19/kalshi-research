Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made the following remarks:

"This evening I will take off for Moscow in order to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The focus of our talks will be the Iranian entrenchment in Syria. We are taking action against it; we are attacking their bases. We will continue to take action against it. This is what I will discuss with the President.

We will continue to act until we get the Iranians to leave Syria because Iran is threatening to destroy Israel and we will not allow it a base close to our border."
