‏‎‏I called Rabbi Jeffrey Myers of the Tree of Life synagogue to send once again my condolences to the bereaved families and to express my appreciation for the dignified way that he has represented the Jewish community of Pittsburgh in the wake of this horrific attack on Jews.

‏‎‏I want to thank all the leaders in the United States and around the world who have condemned this horrendous antisemitic attack.

‏‎‏I want to thank President Trump for going with his family to pay their respects to the dead and to visit the wounded, and for his powerful statement that “those seeking their [the Jewish people’s] destruction – we will seek their destruction.”
