Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his team of advisers this morning met with US Senator George Mitchell and his team of advisers, in the framework of the proximity talks.

The first part of the meeting was held in a smaller forum and dealt with various issues, including the possibility that Israel would consider carrying out confidence-building measures towards the Palestinians in the context of the proximity talks. Israel also expects the Palestinian leadership to work to create a positive atmosphere for the talks and to not undertake international activity against Israel, such as the actions it carried out to prevent Israel from joining the

OECD

The second part of the meeting, with the participation of professionals from both sides, focused on the water issue. Israel believes that on the water issue it should be possible to formulate a plan for regional cooperation with additional neighboring countries and mobilize international investments for the benefit of both Israel and the Palestinian Authority alike.

Prime Minister Netanyahu expressed his desire to make progress in the proximity talks in order to proceed to direct talks very soon.
