Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today commented on

the impressive data issued by the Central Bureau of Statistics on the increase in residential construction starts

. He noted that, "The trend regarding the increase in construction starts reflects my Government's accelerated and successful activity since the beginning of its term. The steps that have already been taken in the real estate market, and the recently-approved national housing committees law and Israel Land Administration reform, have contributed – and will continue to contribute – to greatly increasing the supply of apartments, and a subsequent decline in housing prices, around the country."

According to the CBS data, there has been a 15% increase in construction starts in the first half of 2011 as compared to the same period last year, including a significant 55% increase in the southern district. The data reflect the highest number of apartments under active construction since 2001.
