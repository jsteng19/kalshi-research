Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this morning :

"Together with the people of Israel, my wife Sara and I bow our heads in deep sorrow and embrace the grieving families in their difficult hour.

We have a national and moral obligation to do our utmost to return our hostages – the living and the deceased – and this is what we are doing.

I commend the IDF forces and the security services for acting with great courage in enemy territory in order to return them to their families for a Jewish burial."
