Following are Prime Minister Netanyahu’s remarks at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting: “Today, we will be submitting to the Cabinet a series of appointments, as well as a framework decision approving grants to the citizens of Israel in order to spur the economy and also help create employment. We are talking about a NIS 6 billion framework. We will appoint a ministerial team that will approve the method of allocation. The most important emphasis is on speed, with both the system and the decisions; therefore, this discussion that we want to hold needs to happen in the next 24 hours, if not today, then tomorrow, but no later, so that we can implement it as quickly as possible. Of course, we have a common goal – to stop the spread of the coronavirus by various measures. I remind ministers that by Thursday I have requested each ministry’s plan for a safe exit from the coronavirus restrictions, meaning that if we straighten the curve and reach the goals that we set for the determined number of cases per day, that we can work with over time in the coronavirus routine. This is what I am asking the ministers to submit. Benny Gantz and I discussed several things that can assist to make these matters more efficient. This will come in the next meeting, which will be held tomorrow or Tuesday in order to approve the method of allocation.”
