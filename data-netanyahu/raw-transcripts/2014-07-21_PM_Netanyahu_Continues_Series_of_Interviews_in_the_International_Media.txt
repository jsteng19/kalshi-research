Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening, continued a series of interviews in the international media. He was interviewed on Sky Arabic, Fox and NBC. He told Sky Arabic:

"They [Hamas] have taken billions of dollars. Instead of building kindergartens with it, they're building tunnels, concrete tunnels to blow up our kindergartens.

I can tell you that we opened up a hospital, a field hospital, a humanitarian field hospital on the edge of Gaza and Hamas doesn't let the people come there. They're hiding rockets in hospitals; they're hiding arms in hospitals; they're shooting from hospitals. So they just don't care.

I agreed now to three different calls for ceasefires. We kept them even though Hamas kept firing and they violated every one of those ceasefire calls: the Egyptian ceasefire, the UN ceasefire, the Red Cross ceasefire. We kept them, they broke them.

The goal is to restore quiet and security for the people of Israel for a significant period of time and we'll take whatever action is necessary to achieve that goal."
