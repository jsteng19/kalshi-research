Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu:

It's my pleasure to welcome once again the President of Cyprus, my good friend Nicos. It's wonderful to see you again with your delegation in Jerusalem.

Cyprus and Israel are two small democracies in the eastern Mediterranean.We also share common challenges, and also common opportunities: in security cooperation, in gas, in emergency cooperation, commerce, tourism, many, many fields.

I will never forget that in 2010, when we faced a ferocious forest fire in the Carmel Forest, the first country I called was Cyprus. It offered to send a plane. It did send it, and I was privileged to reciprocate last month when you faced a ferocious forest fire, and we sent our planes to extinguish your flames. Back in April, our two nations, along with Greece, conducted a joint fire-fighting exercise to enhance our regional cooperation in emergency situations.

And that's exactly the kind of thing that friends do. They come to each other's help in times of need, but also cooperate in good times or cooperate to make times better. And that's why I'm particularly proud to have this opportunity to continue the dialogue we began on a tripartite basis in the Nicosia summit. We're continuing those discussions, both bilaterally but also multilaterally, and we continue to send our people.

But of course we know, as leaders, that there's no substitute for the meeting of the people at the top, so in this spirit, I welcome you once again.
