Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is currently meeting with Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov, at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem. He made the following remarks at the joint statements:

"Several weeks ago an IDF Duvdevan unit fighter was wounded and killed. During the mourning period, we promised that we would find the terrorist who killed the late Ronen Lubarsky. Today I would like to praise the IDF and the ISA for a very impressive intelligence-operational operation. It was a Duvdevan fighter who was killed, and it was the Duvdevan unit that apprehended the terrorist. We will continue to deal with whoever tries to attack, and attacks, Israeli civilians and IDF soldiers, to the fullest extent of the law."
