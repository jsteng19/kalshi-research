Prime Minister Netanyahu, at the Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem, met with 41 Democratic members of the US House of Representatives led by US Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-MD). Foreign Minister Yisrael Katz and AIPAC President Mort Friedman also attended the meeting. Following is an excerpt from Prime Minister Netanyahu's remarks: "There's something that I want to put forward to you for a brief moment so that you can understand the broader story of Israel which is not understood and seldom told. There is an exceptional revolution taking place in Israel's position in the world. And secondly, is Israel's place in the revolution that is happening in the world. We are living in revolutionary times. We're forging new agreements, 300 agreements in three years. Given that we have a lot of holidays here, that's about one agreement every two days. Something very very big is happening here."
