Following is an additional excerpt from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s remarks, this morning, at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting: “Today we will submit for Cabinet approval the plans for integrating UN indices on lasting development into the government’s work plans. The UN has set various criteria in fields such as water management, agriculture, health, biotechnology, waste purification and others. On some of these indices we are very advanced and are ahead of the UN and on others not, and it is necessary to close the gap. A year ago, I thought that this would be worthwhile and would facilitate moving the State of Israel to be among the global leaders in vital fields. Therefore, I sought to integrate this into the government’s plans, and the Foreign Minister and the Environment Protection Minister took this mission upon themselves.”
