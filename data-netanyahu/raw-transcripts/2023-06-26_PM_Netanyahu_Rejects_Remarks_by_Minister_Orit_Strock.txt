Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today [translated from Hebrew]:

"The leaders and personnel of our security services are working day and night to defend the State of Israel and its citizens.

In a democracy, everyone is subject to criticism; however, there are no grounds for denigrating the people who are leading our fight against terrorism and for the security of Israel."

In light of the recent upsurge in complaints, Prime Minister Netanyahu ordered an inquiry into claims regarding the use of excessive force by the security forces against citizens in Judea and Samaria.
