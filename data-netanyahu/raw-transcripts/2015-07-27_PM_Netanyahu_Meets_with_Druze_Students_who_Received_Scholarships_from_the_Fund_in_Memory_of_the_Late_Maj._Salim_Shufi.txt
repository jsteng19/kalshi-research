Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this afternoon, at the Knesset met with dozens of Druze students who have received scholarships from the fund in memory of the late Maj. Salim Shufi. Also attending the meeting were Deputy Minister Ayub Kara, the mayor of Majdal Shams, MK Avi Dichter, International Fellowship of Christians and Jews President and CEO Rabbi Yechiel Eckstein and Brig.-Gen. (ret.) Dov Tamari.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said, "For me, Salim symbolized the living partnership between us, certainly the covenant of blood. He was with me when I was in mourning and I was with him when he was in mourning – but a great living partnership. Salim Shufi was a great moral force. He was a splendid man – modest, deep and imbued with values; I loved him very much. I always saw him as an exemplar; and we also said this in his lifetime. Salim did not have to die in order to become a legend; he was a legend in his lifetime. We are certainly fighting for progress, culture, the future and life. I think that you and we can be proud that the State of Israel gave rise to such a soldier and such a man. I think that you, the family members, can be especially proud that he was part of your family. He was simply a great man and I thank you for continuing in his footsteps. I wish that you will continue in his footsteps."
