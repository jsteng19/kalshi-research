Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening:

"Three months ago Hamas committed a terrible massacre against us.

My government directed the IDF to go to war to eliminate Hamas, return our hostages and ensure that Gaza will never again be a threat Israel.

The war must not be stopped until we achieve all of the goals.

We will not give Hamas any immunity whatsoever, and we will fight until we restore security in both the south and the north. Until then, and to that end, everything must be put aside and we must continue with united forces until absolute victory is achieved."
