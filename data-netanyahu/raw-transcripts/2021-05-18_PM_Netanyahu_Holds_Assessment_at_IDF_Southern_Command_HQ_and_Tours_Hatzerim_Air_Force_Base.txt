Prime Minister Netanyahu, following an assessment of the situation at IDF Southern Command headquarters and a tour of the Hatzerim Air Force Base: "I am here at the Hatzerim Air Force Base, and before I was at IDF Southern Command headquarters in Be'er Sheva. I was briefed on our many attacks against Hamas and Islamic Jihad; they received blows that they did not expect. I have no doubt we set them back by years. I am holding assessments of the situation and we are making decisions. We will continue as long as necessary in order to restore the quiet to all citizens of Israel. I am certain that all of our enemies around us see the price that we are exacting for the aggression against us, and I am certain that they will draw the conclusion." Prime Minister Netanyahu held an assessment of the situation at IDF Southern Command headquarters with IDF Chief-of-Staff Lt.-Gen. Aviv Kochavi and visited the Southern Command operations center. Prime Minister Netanyahu then toured the Hatzerim Air Force Base and received an operational briefing – including data on Air Force attacks and operations against various targets in the Gaza Strip – from GOC Air Force and the commander of Squadron 107.
