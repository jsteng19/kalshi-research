The Cabinet, at its weekly meeting , approved the plan of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Finance Minister Yisrael Katz to allocate one-time assistance grants to all citizens of the state in order to encourage consumption and employment, and move the wheels of the economy.

According to the memorandum of the law that was approved by the Cabinet and which will be submitted to the Knesset for legislation in the coming days, every citizen of the country will receive a grant of NIS 750, with an additional NIS 500 for each child up to the third child, to the parent to whom the child allowance is paid.

The grant will be transferred automatically to all citizens whose details are registered with the National Insurance Institute. It was agreed that that the National Insurance Institute would turn to citizens whose bank account details it does not have in order to provide for transfer of the grant.

It was also agreed that those who receive the various support payments detailed in the draft law – including for convalescent care, general handicapped status, income assurance, alimony, handicapped IDF veterans, needy victims of terrorism, needy new immigrants, needy Holocaust survivors and income supplements – will receive an additional NIS 750, thereby receiving an increased grant.

It was also decided that those with an annual income in excess of NIS 651,000 will not be eligible to receive either a grant or a grant supplement.

The scope of the grants plan is NIS 6.5 billion.
