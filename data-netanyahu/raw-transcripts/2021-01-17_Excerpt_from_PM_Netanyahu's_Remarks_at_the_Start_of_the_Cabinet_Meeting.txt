Following is an excerpt from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahuâ€™s remarks at the start of the Cabinet meeting, today: "We are in a close race at the moment between the spread of the disease, with the mutations, and the vaccines. I believe that in cooperation with all citizens of Israel we will win this race. We are bringing more vaccines. Today I hope that we will vaccinate around 200,000 people and thus we will continue during the week in order to allow for the gradual opening, with the green passport, of parts of the economy, and of life, until we open them completely. To this end we will need to assess the morbidity situation and determine whether an additional restricted period is needed. We will decide this at the Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, on Wednesday at the latest, and will issue an announcement to this effect."
