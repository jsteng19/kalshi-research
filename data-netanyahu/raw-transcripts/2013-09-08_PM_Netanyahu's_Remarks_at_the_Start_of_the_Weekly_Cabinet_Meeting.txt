Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made the following remarks at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting:

"First, I would like to thank the soldiers of the IDF, the officers of the Israel Police and Border Police, and all the men and women of our security services for the quiet and peaceful holiday that we just had throughout the country, in the cities and in nature. This is not self-evident given the storm raging around us. We are watching over Israel, an island of tranquility, quiet and security, which also stems from our responsible and balanced policy and the very professional and vigorous action – only some of which is known to the public – by all of the security arms.

The combination of these two things – a sober, balanced and responsible policy and professional security action – is what brought us this quiet. Insofar as it depends on us, we are working so that it will continue. I would like to take this opportunity to wish ministers, as well as the entire Jewish people, a good year,may you be inscribed for good. May we have a good and safe year; that is the first thing.

The second thing is that part of this quiet is also related to the work of the Israel Police to lower the crime rate. Today, Israel Police Commissioner Inspector-General Yohanan Danino will brief us on the continued lowering of the crime rate. This is very welcome. I would like to congratulate him and the Israel Police. I would also like to congratulate you, Public Security Minister Yitzhak Aharonovitch. These things have a direction, trend and policy and you have led it; the Government supports it. We will hear the details about this activity and no less important, the results. In the end, we are measured by results in every field.
