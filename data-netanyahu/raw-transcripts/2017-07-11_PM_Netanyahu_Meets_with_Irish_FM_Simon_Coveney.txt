Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in Jerusalem, met with Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney. The meeting dealt mainly with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Prime Minister Netanyahu expressed his dissatisfaction over Ireland's traditional stance and told the Foreign Minister that his country does not condemn Palestinians for incitement and for glorifying those who commit terrorist attacks. The Prime Minister also asked him why Ireland helps NGOs that call for the destruction of Israel and noted that many European countries are overlooking the core problem of the conflict â€“ the Palestinian refusal to recognize the state of the Jews.
