Following are excerpts from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s remarks, today, at the start of the Cabinet meeting:

"Following the Security Cabinet meeting, we made decisions – to prepare for any scenario. This is the directive that I and the Defense Minister have given and the IDF is indeed prepared for any scenario. Last night was quiet and I hope that that it stays that way. We are prepared for any development; I suggest that our enemies not test us.

At the same time, the police and the security forces in Jerusalem are working to maintain public order and ensure freedom of worship. I think that there as well there has been a decline in the scope of the violations and this is positive, of course. We want to restore full law and order. We will fully enforce the law."
