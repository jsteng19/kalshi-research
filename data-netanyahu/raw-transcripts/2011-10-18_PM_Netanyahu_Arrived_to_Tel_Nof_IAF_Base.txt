Prime Minister Netanyahu arrived to Tel Nof IAF base. Netanyahu approached the Shalit Family and told the parents Noam and Aviva: "I'm glad we've reached this day. You will soon get Gilad back."

Netanyahu added that Gilad's return is going as planned and that he ordered to give them a picture of their son once he arrives in Israel. The PM is currently in the situation room, with the Minister of Defense and the IDF Chief of Staff.
