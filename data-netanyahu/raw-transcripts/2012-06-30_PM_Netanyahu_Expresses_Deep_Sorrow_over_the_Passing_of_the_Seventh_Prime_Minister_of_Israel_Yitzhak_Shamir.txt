The seventh Prime Minister of the State of Israel, Yitzhak Shamir, passed away earlier this evening.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed his deep sorrow:

"Yitzhak Shamir belonged to the generation of giants that established the State of Israel and fought for the freedom of the Jewish People in its Land.

Shamir led the State of Israel out of an abiding loyalty to the People and the Land. Shamir, who lost his family in the Holocaust, fought in the Lehi and as Prime Minister worked to build up the security of the State of Israel and ensure its future; the citizens of the country were ever his concern.

Shamir personified loyalty to the Land of Israel and the eternal values of the Jewish People."
