Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, visited the Ashdod city control center, which was activated at the start of the war. The Prime Minister met with Ashdod Mayor Yechiel Lasri and with the various security heads in the city. Prime Minister Netanyahu was briefed by the Mayor and the city security head on rocket hits in Ashdod, on the public security situation and on the state of business activity in the city. Prime Minister Netanyahu in the control center: "We need national resilience and patience. We also need international leeway, and I am working overtime on this. We need the fighting spirit of the commanders and soldiers, which is amazing. We need patience because we need to complete the work. I do not want 'half' or 'more or less' â€“ I want to eliminate Hamas. What will be afterward, I do not know, but first of all, Hamas must be eliminated. Less than this will not suffice. To this end, we really need the civil home front. First of all, the home front must be defended, so that the home front will give us the strength to continue as well. This will take time. But we, both the military and political leaderships, are very determined to complete the war, to complete this mission, and not give up. Everyone does their part. I am impressed that you are doing your part in the best way possible. I very much appreciate that."
