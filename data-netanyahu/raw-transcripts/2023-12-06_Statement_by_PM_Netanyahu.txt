Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening:

"There are two short updates.

Last night I said that our forces could go anywhere in the Gaza Strip. They are currently surrounding Sinwar's house. His home is not his castle, and he can flee, but it is only a matter of time until we find him.

Second, we are pressing to allow the Red Cross to visit our hostages. To this end, I spoke with the President of the Red Cross again today and I told her to turn to Qatar, since it has been proven that they have leverage over Hamas, and demand Red Cross visits with our hostages and, of course, the providing of medicines for them."
