Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening, at the Kirya in Tel Aviv, met with US Special Presidential Envoy Amos Hochstein and made it clear that Israel is committed to bringing about a fundamental change on its border with Lebanon, so that the residents of the north will return to their homes and live in safety and with security.

The Prime Minister emphasized that we will not stop until this goal has been achieved, whether diplomatically, which Israel prefers, or in some other way.

Prime Minister Netanyahu told US envoy Hochstein that following the murderous assault of October 7th, Israel is more determined, daring and united than ever. He added that those among our neighbors who do not currently understand this will yet do so very well, in the south, in the north and in all other arenas.
