Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening: "This is another impressive vote of confidence in the economic policy that we have been leading. Standard and Poor's, the global credit rating company, has left Israel's credit rating unchanged at its high level during the global coronavirus crisis and at a time when it has lowered the credit rating for developed countries. We will continue to responsibly lead the Israeli economy, and we will assist businesses, the self-employed, wage-earners and all who have been hurt by the coronavirus crisis."
