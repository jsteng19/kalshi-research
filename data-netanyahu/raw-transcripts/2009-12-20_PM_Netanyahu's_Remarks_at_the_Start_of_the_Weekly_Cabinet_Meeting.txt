Following are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting today:

"I want to express outrage over the theft of the entrance sign to the Auschwitz death camp. I call upon the Government of Poland to act in order to catch these disturbed criminals who desecrated the place where over a million Jews were murdered. It is important to preserve the memory of the crime and therefore it is important to preserve the crime scene of the worst incident in the history of the Jewish People and of all humanity.

Today, we will discuss a new law in the war on alcoholism. According to the WHO, Israel is second in the world in consumption of alcohol by eleven year-olds, and the rate of consumption among 15-7 year-olds is over 50%. We are at the onset of an epidemic.

We said that we would propose far-reaching draft legislation on the sale of alcohol to minors. The new law forbids the consumption of alcohol in public places, increases the punishment for anyone selling or providing alcohol to minors and bans the sale of alcohol from 23:00-07:00 at most sales outlets, as well as additional restrictions.

This law is part of the national program to lower alcohol consumption that will be submitted for Cabinet approval. I remind you that we promised to advance this topic. We are advancing it here today via an extensive program and specific legislation. I expect the Knesset to pass the legislation which we will approve today, here in the Cabinet, from there to the Knesset plenum and to the committees. We are in need of this legislation promptly. Israel awaits it."
