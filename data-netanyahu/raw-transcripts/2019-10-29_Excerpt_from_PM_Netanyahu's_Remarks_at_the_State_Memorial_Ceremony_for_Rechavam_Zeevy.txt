Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this afternoon, at Mt. Herzl in Jerusalem, attended the state memorial ceremony for Rechavam Zeevy ("Gandhi"). Following is an excerpt from his remarks: "Today I can say that the plan to build a memorial center for Gandhi at Barkan in Samaria is making significant progress. One month ago, the Prime Minister's Office signed an agreement with the Samaria Regional Council regarding the establishment of this heritage center. Work on the ground will begin in the coming months – and Gandhi, with his loyal and unforgettable wife Yael, will be commemorated in Samaria, which they loved so much." Prime Minister Netanyahu added: "Gandhi always stressed the lesson of the bloody events – we cannot entrust our security to foreigners. Only our strong defensive shield will ensure our existence for generations. Moreover, Gandhi understood that the disturbances of 1929 were no random, passing event. On the contrary – the terrible slaughter teaches about the nature of the conflict between us and our neighbors, those who – for 100 years – have stubbornly refused to recognize the right of the nation-state of the Jewish people. Precisely at a time when there are changes affecting this issue, perhaps very major changes, with several Middle Eastern neighbors, it is this persistence among our immediate neighbors that shows how deep-seated this refusal is. They are indeed refusing – but it is not by their grace that we live here. Our existence depends on our willingness to continue the struggle for our independence and our state, equipped with powerful weapons, imbued with the justice of our cause, and determined to continue building the state, the achievements of which amaze the nations."
