Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, early this morning, upon leaving for Washington, made the following remarks: "I am leaving now for Washington for very important meetings with President Trump. I will, of course, meet with the heads of Congress and address the AIPAC conference. I will speak with President Trump about the Golan, about his historic declaration, about Syria, about the continued pressure on Iran, about the additional sanctions that they have already imposed and will impose, and about the unprecedented security and intelligence cooperation between us. The ties that I have with world leaders – with Putin, with Modi from India, with Bolsonaro, who will arrive here next week from Brazil, with Abe from Japan, with the leaders of China, and with other leaders – are an asset to the State of Israel. However, we have never had such a bond between the prime minister of Israel and an American president. This is a very, very important asset for the State of Israel and it is important that it continue to serve us.”
