Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu:

"Just as Israel has the right of self-defense, the United States has exactly the same right.

Qassem Soleimani is responsible for the death of American citizens and many other innocent people. He was planning more such attacks.

President Trump deserves all the credit for acting swiftly, forcefully and decisively.

Israel stands with the United States in its just struggle for peace, security and self-defense."
