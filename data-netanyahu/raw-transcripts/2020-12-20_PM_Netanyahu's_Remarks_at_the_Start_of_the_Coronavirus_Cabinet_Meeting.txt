Following are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks at the start of the Corona Cabinet meeting today:

"Yesterday I received the first anti-coronavirus vaccine in Israel. I feel great. I call on all citizens of Israel to go and be vaccinated. If we vaccinate everyone, or at least most of us, we will defeat the pandemic.

The steps that the government has taken, and will take, are insufficient. What is necessary is the personal responsibility of every citizen; this is the only way to defeat this. Even if the government makes and implements all of the decisions, without involving the people there is no way to defeat the coronavirus.

With your involvement, together with the millions of vaccines that we have brought to the country, we can emerge from this pandemic with great success, perhaps before all of the countries in the world.

Last night, I consulted with the Defense, Health, Foreign, Interior and Transportation ministers. This consultation was necessary in light of the British statement about a new coronavirus mutation. I immediately directed that a team of experts, director generals, the Health Ministry and, of course, the relevant ministers – chaired by the National Security Council – convene in order to prevent the arrival and spread of this virus to Israel.

We will also be briefed today on the vaccination plan as several Cabinet members have requested."
