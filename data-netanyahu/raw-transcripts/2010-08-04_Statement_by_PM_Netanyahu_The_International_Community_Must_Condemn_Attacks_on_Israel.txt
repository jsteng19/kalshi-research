For years many in the international community have remained silent when rockets have been fired at Israeli civilians, and when unprovoked attacks have been launched against our soldiers.

Expressions of outrage have largely been reserved for Israel's response to those attacks.

Firing missiles on civilians is a war crime, and unprovoked attacks on soldiers are blatant acts of aggression.

Israel expects the international community to condemn such attacks in the strongest possible terms.

All those in the international community committed to peace should support Israel's right to defend itself against those who attack the innocent and seek to destroy peace.
