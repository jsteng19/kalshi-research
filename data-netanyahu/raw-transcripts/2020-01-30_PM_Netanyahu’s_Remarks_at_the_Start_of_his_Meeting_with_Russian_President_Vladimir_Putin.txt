Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is currently meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin in Moscow. Prime Minister Netanyahu said the following at the start of the meeting: “Mr. President, all of our visits and all of our conversations are important. This visit symbolizes an even greater warming in the relations between us. First, I want to commend you for your historic remarks during your important visit to Israel. We will all remember your moving speech at the dedication ceremony for the monument to the heroes of Leningrad. You spoke about your family and their personal suffering, and the immense sacrifice of the Russian people in the war against the Nazis. Afterwards, you gave another moving and very significant speech at Yad Vashem at the ceremony marking 75 years since the liberation of Auschwitz. These remarks will be remembered. Second, we discussed in Israel several matters related to the region. We held several conversations with our American friends regarding these issues and I would like to update you about certain developments there. Third, I would like to thank you on behalf of the people of Israel for your quick decision to give a pardon to Naama Issachar. This moves all of us and our gratitude is on behalf of all Israeli citizens, from the heart. Mr. President, you are, in effect, the first leader that I am speaking to about my visit to Washington regarding President Trump’s plan of the century. I think that a new and perhaps unique opportunity has been created here, and, I would like to discuss with you and hear from you, of course, your understandings and to see how we can integrate all forces on behalf of security and peace. In any case, I must say that relations between Russia and Israel are steadfast, strong and the best they have ever been. I would like to thank you Mr. President for your personal leadership also in regard to several other matters as well.”
