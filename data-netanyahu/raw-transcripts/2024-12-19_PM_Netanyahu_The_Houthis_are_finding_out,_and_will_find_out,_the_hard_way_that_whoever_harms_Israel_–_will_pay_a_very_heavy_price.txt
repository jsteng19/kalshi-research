Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today:

"This morning, the Air Force attacked strategic targets of the Houthis in the port of Hodeidah and deep into Yemen.

We did this in response to repeated Houthi attacks against civilian targets in Israel. Last night they attacked a school in Ramat Gan.

They are not attacking just us – they are attacking the entire world. They are attacking the international shipping and commercial lanes. Thus, when Israel takes action against the Houthis, it is acting on behalf of the entire international community. The Americans understand this very well, as do many others.

After Hamas, Hezbollah and the Assad regime in Syria, the Houthis are almost the last arm of Iran's axis of evil. They are finding out, and will find out, the hard way that whoever harms Israel – will pay a very heavy price."
