Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made the following remarks about the gas outline:

"This is a great day for the State of Israel. I am committed to bringing the gas to the Israeli economy, the hundreds of billions for the education, social welfare and health of Israel's citizens, and tens of billions for investments and jobs.

We have improved the outline. It passed the Cabinet and passed the Knesset by an overwhelming majority. There is one more obstacle but when I want to achieve something, I achieve it. There will be gas for Israel. I want it for the citizens of Israel, to lower the cost of living, to channel vast sums to the state coffers for energy security.

This will be achieved. We are moving forward step by step and overcoming one obstacle after another.

They told us at the outset: We have not seen the outline so we opened the outline. They told us to improve it; we improved it. They told us to submit it to the Cabinet; we did so and it was approved. They told us to submit it to the Knesset and we approved it by majority vote. Now we have one obstacle left and we will overcome it because it is the right thing for the citizens of Israel."
