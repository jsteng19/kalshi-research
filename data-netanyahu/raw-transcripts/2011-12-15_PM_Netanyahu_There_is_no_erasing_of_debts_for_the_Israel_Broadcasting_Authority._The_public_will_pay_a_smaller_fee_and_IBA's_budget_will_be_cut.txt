In the wake of erroneous reports about erasing Israel Broadcasting Authority's financial debt, the office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is the minister responsible for IBA, reports that IBA does not owe so much as NIS 1. Its failure to meet its obligation to purchase programming by outside producers will be discussed at this Sunday's Cabinet meeting.

Additionally, Prime Minister Netanyahu decided that the television and radio fee will be reduced by 5% next year and thus rejected IBA's request to cancel the planned reduction in the fee. The decision means that IBA's budget will be cut by NIS 30 million.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said that, "IBA must become more efficient and reduce the financial burden on citizens."
