Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with Fahmy Karkara, the father of Muhammad Karkara, who was killed this morning on the Golan Heights.

At the Jewish Media Summit in Jerusalem, Prime Minister Netanyahu said, "The enemies of the State of Israel shrink from nothing. They do not shrink from attacking civilians and from killing children, as occurred this morning. They do not distinguish between Jewish and non-Jewish citizens of the State of Israel. As a nation, our heart is torn over the abduction of any youth and the murder of any youth, and I am certain that I represent all of you as I send my condolences to this grieving family."
