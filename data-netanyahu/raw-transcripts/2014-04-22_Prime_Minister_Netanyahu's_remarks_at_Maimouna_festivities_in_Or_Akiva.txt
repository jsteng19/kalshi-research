"Today we see the Palestinian Authority, which yesterday spoke about disbanding, talking with Hamas about unity. They should decide whether they want to disband or have unity, and when they want peace, they should let us know because we want a genuine peace. And on our holiday today, our enemies fired missiles at our communities and our policy is clear â€“ to respond quickly and strongly. We strike at whoever comes to attack us. This is what we have done and this is what we will do. I would like to thank the police personnel, soldiers and volunteers, and all members of the security and rescue services, who guarded the millions of Israelis throughout Passover."
