Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at his official residence in Jerusalem, met with President-elect Reuven Rivlin and congratulated him on being elected to the office.

At the end of their meeting, Prime Minister Netanyahu said, "We have known each other for several good decades. We are both from Jerusalem, the sons of professors who were educated in the philosophy of Jabotinsky and we have much more in common â€“ such as our football team. Joint work on behalf of all Israelis is before us. We have gone through much together and I am certain that we will now know to put the less good aspects aside and work responsibly for the future of the State of Israel."
