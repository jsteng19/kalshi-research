Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this morning in his speech at Jaffa port, referred to the sentencing of Moshe Katsav:

"This is an extraordinary day in the State of Israel. This is a day of sadness and shame, but it is also a day of deep appreciation and pride for the Israeli justice system. The court issued a sharp and unequivocal ruling on a simple principle, that of equality before the law; nobody is above the law, not even a former president, all are subject to the law. This distinguishes the State of Israel to a very large degree. The second aspect that the court ruled on today is equality between men and women. Every woman has the right to her body, the right to respect and freedom, and nobody has the right to take these from her. This also distinguishes the State of Israel to a very large degree. Therefore, it would be worth remembering sometimes that when we look around us and see how different our state is â€“ a bastion of democracy, human rights and individual rights, and a bastion of the rule of law."
