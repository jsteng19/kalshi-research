Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at Hadassah Ein Kerem hospital in Jerusalem, visited InbarAzrak, who was injured by a firebomb in a terrorist attack in northern Jerusalem last night.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"Last Friday, I visited baby Ali's brother, who was injured by a firebomb that was thrown at his house by those who commit acts of terrorism against Arabs. I have just visited with Inbar, a young woman who was injured by a firebomb that was thrown by those who commit acts of terrorism against Jews. Ali's brother is only four-years-old. Inbar is the mother of three children, aged two, three and four. Terrorism is terrorism is terrorism. Our policy is zero tolerance for terrorism and it does not matter where it comes from. We condemn it and we fight it to the same degree.

Several days ago the international community joined in my condemnation of terrorism directed against Arabs and I expect that they will similarly join in vis-à-vis terrorism directed against Jews. I am still waiting.

I have heard from the margins of our society that there are those who say that there is a higher law above the laws of the state. I would like to make it clear: There is no law above the laws of the state, which apply to everyone. Against those who violate them, those who champion hate crimes, those who use violence and those who use terrorism, we will use the full weight of the law including – if need be, as we did yesterday – administrative detention. Zero tolerance for terrorism – this is what obligates us and the international community as well."
