Prime Minister Netanyahu issued the following statement: "I express deep sorrow over the passing of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Taub, the Admor of Kaliv. The Hasidic admor survived the horrors of the Holocaust and dedicated himself to rebuilding the world of Torah in the State of Israel and among the Jewish diaspora. At the same time, he was tirelessly engaged in enshrining the memory of the Holocaust, especially the triumph of the impressive spirit in the ghettos and camps. The passing of the Admor of Kaliv close to Holocaust Martyrs' and Heroes' Remembrance Day strengthens our eternal commitment â€“ to remember and not forget. May his memory be blessed."
