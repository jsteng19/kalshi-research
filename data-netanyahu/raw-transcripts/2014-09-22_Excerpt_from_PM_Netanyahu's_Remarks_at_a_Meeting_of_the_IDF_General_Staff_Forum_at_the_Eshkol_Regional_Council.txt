Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the Eshkol Regional Council building, attended a meeting of the IDF General Staff Forum. Also participating were Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon, IDF Chief-of-Staff Lt.-Gen. Benny Gantz, members of the IDF General Staff, Eshkol Regional Council Chairman Haim Jellin, Shaar Hanegev Regional Council Chairman Alon Shuster, Hof Ashkelon Regional Council Chairman Yair Farjun and Sderot Mayor Alon Davidi.

Following is an excerpt from Prime Minister Netanyahu's remarks at the start of the meeting:

"Yesterday the Cabinet approved an economic assistance plan of unprecedented magnitude . We came to the country to build and to be built. In order to build up our country we need a strong economy and security. These are related. It is easy to dispense promises to everyone but it is much more difficult to conduct a responsible policy. Over the years we have conducted a responsible budget policy. We have managed the economy correctly and the results are readily apparent because the Israeli economy has received high marks from international markets . But alongside this, the security threats against the state of Israel require a considerable increase in the defense budget. I am responsible for maintaining both Israel's economy and Israel's security. These are the considerations that have guided the state budgets that I have passed up until now both as Finance Minister and as Prime Minister."
