Following are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting today:

"We are anxiously monitoring what is happening in Egypt and [elsewhere] in our region. Last night, I spoke with US President Barack Obama and US Secretary of State Hilary Clinton. I also held consultations with Defense Minister Ehud Barak, Foreign Minister Avigdor Liberman and with Israeli intelligence officials.

Our efforts are designed to continue and maintain stability and security in our region. I remind you that

the peace between Israel and Egypt has endured for over three decades

and our goal is to ensure that these relations continue. Of course, at this time, we must show maximum responsibility, restraint and sagacity and, to this end, I have instructed my fellow ministers to refrain from commenting on this issue. Naturally, we are also holding consultations in the appropriate government forums.

Tomorrow,

German Chancellor Angela Merkel will arrive in Israel

, along with ministers of her government, in the framework of the biannual meetings between the Israeli and German governments. We will hold a joint Cabinet meeting. We have many common interests regarding economics, security, foreign affairs and our desire to advance peace. We view Germany – one of the most important countries in the world, and one of the most important for Israel – as a main anchor in our relations with Europe. It is self-evident that, during the visit, we will discuss the developing situation in the region."
