Palestinian Authority Chairman Abu Mazen tonight called Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and expressed his regret over

last night's murders in Itamar

. The Prime Minister stressed that such condemnations were insufficient and added that not only must the incitement stop but education for peace must begin.

Prime Minister Netanyahu added that violence had to be condemned not because it went against the PA's political interests but because morally it is unacceptable. "I expect you to stop the incitement in schools, textbooks and mosques and for you to educate your children for peace as we are doing. Murdering children in their sleep is murder for its own sake," the Prime Minister said.
