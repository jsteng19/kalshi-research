Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today made the following remarks on the occasion of

Exit and Deportation of Jews from Arab Lands and Iran Day

"Today, for the first time, we are marking the exit and deportation of hundreds of thousands of Jews from Arab countries and from Iran in the years following the establishment of the State of Israel. It is not for nothing that this day is marked on the day after the 29th of November. The Arab countries, which never accepted

the UN declaration on the establishment of a Jewish state

, compelled the Jews living in their territories to leave their homes while leaving their assets behind. In several instances the deportations were accompanied by pogroms and violence against Jews. We have acted – and will continue to act – so that they and their claims are not forgotten."
