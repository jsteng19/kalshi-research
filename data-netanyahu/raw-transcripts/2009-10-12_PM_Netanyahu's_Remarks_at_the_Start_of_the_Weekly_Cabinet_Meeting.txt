Following are PM Netanyahu's remarks at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting today :

"Today, we will be briefed on last week's events in Jerusalem.

Last week, extremist elements tried to undermine quiet and peaceful life in Jerusalem. An extremist minority disseminated lies to the effect that we intend to dig, or were actually digging, under the Temple Mount. I would like to make it clear that this is an outright lie.

I appreciate the fact that the decisive majority of Israeli Arabs were not dragged after these provocations and did not allow the extremists to exploit the lies. This morning, I would like to appeal to Israel's Arab citizens, who want to live good and peaceful lives here and tell you that you are an inseparable part of the State of Israel. We in the Government want and will act so that you have fully equal opportunities in all areas – education, employment and infrastructures. Our intention is to implement the goals that we all share – peaceful coexistence, good neighborly relations and a prosperous future for our children, as citizens with equal rights in the State of Israel.

I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the police and the security forces who did – and are doing – their utmost to maintain quiet and public order."
