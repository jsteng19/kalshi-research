Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara today, at their official residence, met, for approximately two hours, with Aviva and Noam Shalit. Hagai Hadas, the Prime Minister's special representative on the return of

abducted soldier Gilad Shalit

, was also present.

Prime Minister Netanyahu and special representative Hadas updated the Shalits on the varied efforts to bring about the release of their son Gilad. The Prime Minister said that he would continue to act – without respite, through various channels – for Gilad's release.

Prime Minister and Mrs. Netanyahu appealed to Aviva and Noam: "We understand that you do not want to leave your tent even for the New Year. However, we suggest that in order to make it easier on yourselves, that you spend the holiday at home in order to garner strength, and return here afterwards. We hope that our next meeting will be at your home in the Galilee together with Gilad."
