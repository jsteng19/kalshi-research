Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this morning received

the Bank of Israel 2009 Annual Report

from BOI Gov. Stanley Fisher, who said that, "The 2009 report describes a more successful year than we initially expected. The growth forecast for 2010 is higher than the 0.7% growth that was achieved in 2009."

Prime Minister Netanyahu commended Gov. Fisher on accepting another term and said that, "

The last quarter of 2009 was marked by 4.9% growth in GDP

, a very respectable figure and almost the highest among developed countries. You make growth forecasts while I set growth targets. We will continue to move forward with reforms so that growth will be higher than 0.7%. We will continue to advance the economy so that the next report is even better."
