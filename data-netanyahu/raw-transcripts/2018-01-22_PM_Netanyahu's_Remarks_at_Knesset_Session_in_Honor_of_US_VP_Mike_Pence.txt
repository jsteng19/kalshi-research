My friend Mike,

I want to begin with a few personal words in English.

It is fitting that you are the first American Vice President to speak at the Knesset in Jerusalem.

Fitting, because no American Vice President has had a greater commitment to Israel and its people.

As a Congressman, you were unequivocal in your support for Israel.

As Governor, you signed the toughest anti-BDS bill in America.

And as Vice President, you have stood shoulder-to-shoulder with President Trump over the past year to make the alliance between America and Israel stronger than ever.

It is truly an honor to have you address the Knesset today, but there's another reason that it's fitting that you are here today.

And because of its immense importance to the history of our people, let me now speak in the language of our people.

Mr. Vice President,

As you may know—I want to make sure that the translation gets it right—there are 11 cities in the United States called Jerusalem.

Jerusalem, Utah; Jerusalem, Vermont; Jerusalem, Michigan; and there are eight more. And they are all inspired by this shining city on a hill, Jerusalem, Israel.

Mr. Vice President,

We have a common past.

We have a common future.

We have a shared destiny. [Hebrew]

America has no greater friend than Israel, and Israel has no greater friend than the United States of America.

And finally, Mr. Vice President,

Let me express not only our profound gratitude, but also our deepest hope that President Trump and you will succeed in strengthening the United States militarily and economically, so that America will continue to be the greatest power in the world for generations to come.

A stronger America means a stronger Israel.

And when America and Israel stand strong together, the forces of freedom, progress and peace will ultimately prevail.

Mr. Vice President,

God bless you and your family,

God bless America,

and God bless Israel.
