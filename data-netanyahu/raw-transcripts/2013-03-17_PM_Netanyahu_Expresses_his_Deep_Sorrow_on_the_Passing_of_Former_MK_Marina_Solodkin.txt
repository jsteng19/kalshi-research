Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expresses his deep sorrow on the passing of

former MK Marina Solodkin

. "Marina Solodkin was a principled public representative who was always attentive to the problems of Israel's citizens. In her modest and direct way, she concerned herself with the citizens' welfare and specially devoted herself to the problems of new immigrants. She cared, was thorough and had a basic humanity. I esteemed her very much; we will all feel her loss," the Prime Minister said.
