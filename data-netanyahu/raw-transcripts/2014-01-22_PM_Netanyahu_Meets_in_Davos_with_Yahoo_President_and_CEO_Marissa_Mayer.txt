Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the

2014 World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos

met with Yahoo President and CEO Marissa Mayer and told her that whereas major powers were once measured in terms of territory, today they are measured by the number of unique users. The Prime Minister presented the advantages of investing in Israeli technology and discussed the leading position of cyber technologies. He also asked what he could do to increase Yahoo's investments in Israel and said that he would like Yahoo to increase its presence in, and partnership with, Israel. Mayer thanked him for his remarks and said that she expects to visit Israel this coming July.
