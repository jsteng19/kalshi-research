The meeting was very friendly and warm. Following the meeting, they delivered joint statements to the press.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu:

"Mr. Speaker, Mike, thank you. I have developed as you say a very warm personal bond with you. We both know what coalitions are. But I have to say that I'm impressed with your leadership, with your initiative, and for me, most of all, your friendship to the State of Israel, the Jewish people, the Jewish state. The American-Israeli alliance has never been stronger.

I am now completing a week, which began with an extraordinary meeting with President Trump. Under his leadership, the critical decisions that show his commitment and the American people's commitment to Israel have come to the fore instantly.

I was deeply moved by the reception that we got. The substantive things that we discussed - making sure that Iran never gets a nuclear weapon and also making sure that Hamas's capabilities are destroyed.

I want to thank you. I want to tell you that you are invited to Israel. This year in Jerusalem. You will be welcomed on a red carpet".
