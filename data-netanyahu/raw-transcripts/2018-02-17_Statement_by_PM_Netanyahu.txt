Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu:

"The Polish Prime Minister's remarks here in Munich are outrageous. There is a problem here of an inability to understand history and a lack of sensitivity to the tragedy of our people. I intend to speak with him forthwith.

Today's incident on the Gaza Strip border is severe. We will respond appropriately. I send my wishes for a quick recovery to the wounded."
