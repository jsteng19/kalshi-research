Pursuant to a directive from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, National Security Council (NSC) head Meir Ben-Shabbat convened a discussion on tightening enforcement in light of the spread of the coronavirus. Interior Minister Aryeh Deri, Health Minister Yuli Edelstein, Federation of Local Authorities Chairman Haim Bibas, Health Ministry Director General Moshe Bar Siman Tov, Interior Ministry Director General Mordechai Cohen, deputy Attorney Generals, senior Israel Police commanders and other senior officials also attended the discussion.

The urgent discussion was convened in order to formulate immediate practical steps to tighten enforcement of the health directives dealing with the coronavirus.

It was determined that given the worrying trends vis-à-vis the spread pf the coronavirus, an immediate tightening of enforcement by the existing forces (police, local authority inspectors and qualified Population and Immigration Authority inspectors – each according to their field) was required in the following four areas:

* Wearing masks

* Gatherings contrary to directives

* The "purple badge" standard for businesses and commercial centers

* Enforcing quarantine for people with coronavirus and persons with whom they have been in contact

It was also decided that in addition to the existing forces, local authority inspectors would also assist in enforcement, especially regarding the wearing of masks.

* The Federation of Local Authorities will finish preparing an immediate training program and prepare to train inspectors accordingly by next Monday.

* The Justice Ministry will complete legislative procedures to authorize the inspectors in this regard

* The Public Security Ministry will provide overall guidance.
