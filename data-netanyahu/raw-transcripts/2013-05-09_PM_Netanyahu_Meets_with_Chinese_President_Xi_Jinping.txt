Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, met with Chinese President Xi Jinping and said, at the start of the meeting:

"We view China with great admiration and we know that it is led by forward-looking leaders with great vision, great clarity and great openness. As you said, I came in an interval of 15 years and the success of China, its development, is remarkable. In that time Israel also made many gains, many achievements. But I believe that we cannot rest on our laurels, on our past successes. We have to assure success of the future, this is my approach to Israel. So I came with a simple proposal, that we seize the future using our respective advantages. China is a leading global power in so many fields, and Israel is a global center of technology. My proposal is to have a government-to-government systematic plan to make partnerships between Israeli technologists and experts and [their] Chinese counterparts, on a level of senior officials, based on China's five years plan, and I think that we can achieve even greater successes working together."
