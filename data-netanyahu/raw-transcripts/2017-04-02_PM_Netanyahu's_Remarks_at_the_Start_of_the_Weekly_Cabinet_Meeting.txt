Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting, made the following remarks:

"We have an absolute obligation to the security of Israel's citizens. In the context of this obligation, we are working systematically to strengthen the offensive capability of the State of Israel against its enemies. We are also working, to the same degree, to strengthen our defensive capability against our enemies.

This afternoon, the David's Sling missile defense interceptor will become operational. This is important news; all of Israel's citizens experienced the important achievement of the Iron Dome system against short range missiles in the last Gaza campaign. Of course, we also developed the Arrow system against strategic long-range missiles, as well as other systems. David's Sling acts in the intermediate range and is of great importance to Israel's security. I would like to commend the people at the Defense Ministry, the IDF, the R&D people and everyone who worked to make this system operational. We are defending the home front.

At the same time we are trying to resolve the ammonia crisis. On the one hand, we have an obligation to the security of the residents of the greater Haifa area. This is crystal clear and is also our guidepost. We are also doing everything to prevent the dismissal of 1,500 workers on the eve of Passover, as well as damage to an industry that has not yet organized for the implementation of the decision to close the tank. I hope we will have good news soon."
