PM Defense Minister Netanyahu attended a civil New Year event with Christian IDF soldiers at the Tel Aviv Palmach Museum. Following is an excerpt from his remarks:

"We are proud of you; the entire nation is proud of you. You belong to the most moral army on earth.

Not everyone shares this view. I was just exposed to the daily trolling of the anti-Semitic dictator Erdogan.

He is obsessed with Israel. He knows what a moral army is and he knows what a genuine democracy is, as opposed to an army that massacres women and children in Kurdish villages and a state which, to my regret, is becoming more dictatorial day by day.

He is obsessed with Israel. But there has been an improvement. Erdogan used to attack me every two hours and now it is every six hours."
