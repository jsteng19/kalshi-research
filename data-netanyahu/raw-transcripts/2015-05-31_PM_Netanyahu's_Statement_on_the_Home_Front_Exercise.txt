Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in his remarks at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting, made the following statement on the national home front exercise that is starting today:

"I must say that alongside the development of our offensive capabilities, which is in a very impressive high gear, most of which is known to the public, we are also busy with preparing the home front for future campaigns because we have discovered that that home front is a front line. There has been very great success; we saw this in Operation Protective Edge and at other times, in developments that we have made in both active and passive defense. Adequate preparation is important because planning well will pay off in the end.

We are holding an exercise that will continue from Sunday until Thursday. It includes almost all – I do not think almost all – ministries represented around this table. We are as prepared defensively as we are offensively and I think this capability is steadily improving."
