Prime Minister Netanyahu on the passing of the late Eitan Haber:

"I regret the passing of the late Eitan Haber, who was among the pillars of Israeli journalism for decades.

Haber won a name for himself as a thorough and credible man of letters. The security of Israel topped his concerns and he wrote about it in clear, original and fascinating language. His many books, which enrich the shelf of military literature, are of historical value.

Eitan Haber assisted several leaders of the state, especially the late Yitzhak Rabin. We will never forget his emotional and dramatic announcement about the shocking murder. As head of the Prime Minister's bureau, he was imbued with a sense of mission and dedication to his position. He was – inter alia – on the team that paved the way to the peace agreement with Jordan.

I remember my many conversations with Eitan over the years and the insights that I gained from his knowledge and his experience.

I send my sincerest condolences to his family.

May his memory be blessed."
