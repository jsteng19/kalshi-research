Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Health Minister Yuli Edelstein, this afternoon, at Ben-Gurion International Airport, welcomed a shipment of Pfizer anti-corona virus vaccines.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"This is a great day for the State of Israel with a huge shipment that has arrived in the framework of Operation Back to Life, a plane full of injections of encouragement. I agreed with my friend, Pfizer Chairman and CEO Albert Bourla, that we would bring shipment after shipment and complete the vaccination of the over-16 population in Israel during the month of March.

Today, over 72% of our people over 60 have been vaccinated and we will complete this. Next Sunday, an additional shipment will arrive and we will start vaccinating the next group; people aged 50-60 and up and thus we will proceed. The Health Minister and I agreed today to increase the pace of vaccinations to 170,000 a day. This is a world record. I am certain that our amazing HMO medical teams and of course the nurses whose enthusiasm I can see, how they come to work with great energy together with the doctors, and MDA and Health Ministry personnel; all of them together, they will get this done."
