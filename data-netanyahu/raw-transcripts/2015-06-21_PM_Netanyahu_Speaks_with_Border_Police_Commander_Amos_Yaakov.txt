Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with Border Police Commander Amos Yaakov and conveyed his best wishes for a quick recovery to the Border Policeman who shot the terrorist that attempted to murder him this morning. "On behalf of all Israelis, tell this fighter that he is a great hero. He acted with exceptional heroism and is deserving of high esteem. I commend both his determination and that of all security service personnel who – time and again – thwart the many attempts to attack us," the Prime Minister said.
