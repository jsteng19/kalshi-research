Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, at the Kirya in Tel Aviv, met with US Presidential Special Envoy Amos Hochstein.

The Prime Minister made it very clear that it will not be possible to return our residents without a fundamental change in the security situation in the north.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said that while Israel appreciates and respects the support of the US, it will – ultimately – do what is necessary to safeguard its security and return the residents of the north securely to thei homes.
