Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting, made the following remarks:

"Tomorrow, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull – who leads one of the State of Israel's greatest friends – will arrive in Israel. Together with the Governor General of New Zealand, we will mark 100 years since the liberation of Be'er Sheva by Australian and New Zealand forces.

Later in the week I will leave for London in order to participate in events marking 100 years since the Balfour Declaration, which recognized the Land of Israel as the national home of the Jewish People and advanced the international moves that established the State of Israel. While the state would not have arisen without settlement, sacrifice and a willingness to fight for it, the international impetus was, undoubtedly, the Balfour Declaration. British Prime Minister Theresa May and Jewish community leaders will also participate in this event and, of course, I will hold working meetings with her and with British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. We will also hold meetings with UK corporate leaders in order to bring them to invest in Israel.

Today, the Cabinet will receive an updated revenue forecast for the next three years according to the numerator law. We passed a special law that enables us to control government expenditures and prevent large future deficits. I must say that Israel is one of the few advanced countries that uses this important tool.

2017 will apparently be a very successful year for the state treasury; it has brought in more money than expected. Our major challenge is to continue to manage the Israeli economy cautiously and responsibly in order to continue the prosperity while co-opting the public strata. Of course, we will discuss this until the end of the year and we will need to decide how to deal with the accumulated reserves."
