Following are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks today, at the start of a meeting of the Likud Knesset faction:

On sanctions against Iran:

"Today the EU has decided to impose sanctions on the export of petroleum from Iran. I think that this is a step in the right direction. True, it is still impossible to know what the result of these sanctions will be. Very strong and quick pressure on Iran is necessary. Sanctions will have to be evaluated on the basis of results. As of today, Iran is continuing to produce nuclear weapons without hindrance."

On the issue of Palestinian incitement:

"A few days ago we heard very serious remarks by the Palestinian Mufti in Jerusalem. These remarks are especially serious both because they remind us of the statements of another mufti who called for the annihilation of the Jews, Haj Amin Al-Husseini, who was one of the architects of the Final Solution, and because they are being uttered today by people who are supposed to support the building of peace between us and our Palestinian neighbors. The call to murder Jews simply because they are Jews is a terrible thing from an ethical point-of-view and is an obstacle to peace. Incitement in general is an obstacle to peace. What is especially serious is that as of today, not only has the Palestinian Authority neither condemned nor taken exception to the remarks, it enabled them to be broadcast on official Palestinian television. I expect senior PA officials to condemn this act. Those who want peace should not allow such incitement and calls to murder Jews."
