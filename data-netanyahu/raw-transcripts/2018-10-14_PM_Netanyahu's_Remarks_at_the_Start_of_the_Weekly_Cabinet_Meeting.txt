Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this morning, at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting, made the following remarks:

"Hamas, apparently, has not internalized the message. If they do not stop the violent attacks against us, they will be stopped in a different way and it will be painful – very painful. We are very close to a different kind of activity, an activity that will include very powerful blows. If it has sense, Hamas will stop firing and stop these violent disturbances – now.

Regarding approval of the enlistment law, this is a good and balanced law. It balances between the needs of the military, which prepared it, and, of course, the needs of the ultra-orthodox public. This law needs to pass. The time has come to put it behind us. This is my position. This also needs to be the position of the government, for the good of the country, of the ultra-orthodox public, and for relations between the ultra-orthodox and the secular. Therefore, I call on the Council of Torah Sages, which is convening today, to make the right decision. This law is good for Israel.

The government will approve today a national program to increase safety for those who ride electric bicycles, scooters and other vehicles. This has turned out to be a new type of road danger; for cyclists, pedestrians, and motorists. I welcome the professional and swift work done by the government ministries, the Prime Minister's Office, the Ministry of Transport, in coordination with the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of the Interior. I call on all riders - ride carefully and ride responsibly.

We are beginning the academic year. On behalf of all the government ministers, I wish more than 300,000 students a successful school year. Learn well and grasp the future - they go together."
