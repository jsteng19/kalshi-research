Following is an excerpt from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks , at the state memorial ceremony for Paula and David Ben-Gurion:

"There can be no going back to the previous nuclear agreement. We must stick to an uncompromising policy of ensuring that Iran will not develop nuclear weapons.

Thanks to our determined stand against the nuclearization of Iran, and to our opposition to the nuclear agreement with Iran, many Arab countries have fundamentally changed their approach to Israel."
