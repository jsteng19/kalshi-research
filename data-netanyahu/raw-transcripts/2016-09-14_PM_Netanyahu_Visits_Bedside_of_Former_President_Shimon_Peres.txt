Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at Chaim Sheba Medical Center at Tel Hashomer, visited the bedside of former President Shimon Peres. He spoke at length with the family and the medical staff and inquired after the former President's well-being.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"I think that I speak for the entire Israeli people, as well as for many people outside Israel, who feel a certain relief this evening. For myself, and for my wife, I can tell you, a great relief, because he is better this evening than he was yesterday evening and with G-d's help, he will be better still tomorrow evening. But, as we have defined it, this is navigating a minefield. I have the impression that the Chaim Sheba Medical Center has an exceptional staff of doctors, caregivers and nurses, an exceptional staff for an exceptional man.

My prayer has, at least, strengthened today having seen the dedicated care as well as signs of hope. Of course, it is too early to say and we will all continue to hope and pray, and rely on you."
