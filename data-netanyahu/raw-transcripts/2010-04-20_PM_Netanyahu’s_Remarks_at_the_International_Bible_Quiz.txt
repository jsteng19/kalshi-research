I would first like to say that my wife and I were very excited about our son's participation; it’s only natural. I was very impressed, deeply impressed, by the accomplishments of Or, Elad and the other contestants. They are, each and every one of them, Bible champions.

David Ben-Gurion, our first prime minister, said that the foundation of our culture, education and nation's existence here in the State of Israel is the Bible. Bible study is an inalienable asset for the children of Israel. I was taught the Bible, my brothers were taught the Bible, we all were taught the Bible – religious children and secular children and everyone in between. The Bible is again becoming the Book of Books of the people of Israel.

My colleague, Minister of Education Gideon Saar, and I are doing important work to strengthen this very foundation, which the fifth president of the State of Israel, Yitzhak Navon, just spoke of. We are going to do something else, Former President Navon. You asked, when it will be? We will not wait another year or two years until we reinstate the Bible Quiz for adults. It will happen during the upcoming Hanukkah holiday. We will have the Bible Quiz for adults again because the Bible does not only belong to certain groups, but to young people, adults and the elderly alike. Maybe just not to babies quite yet.

We are reinstating this tradition with full force because the Bible is the foundation of the existence of the people of Israel, and it is the foundation for the existence of the State of Israel.

Congratulations to you all. May you serve as an inspiration.
