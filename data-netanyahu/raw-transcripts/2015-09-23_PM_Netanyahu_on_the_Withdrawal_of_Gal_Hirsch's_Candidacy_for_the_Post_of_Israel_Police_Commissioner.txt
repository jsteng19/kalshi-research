Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this evening released the following statement:

"Approximately one month ago, reserve Brig.-Gen. Gal Hirsch was chosen by Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan as his candidate for the post of Israel Police Commissioner.

I expressed my satisfaction with the appointment and my great appreciation for the candidate, a man of considerable merit and action for the security of the state.

Gal Hirsch is the right man for the post of Police Commissioner; I thought so then and I think so now.

But our appointments process is long, arduous and damaging, and undoubtedly deserves reexamination.

For a month already Gal Hirsch's good name has been trampled anew by critics. And for what? For agreeing to leave successful work and to report for a challenging and important national mission for all citizens of the state.

He agreed without hesitation and look what happened:

Slander and denigration. It is not proper to act this way toward someone who has sacrificed his best years, energy and talent on behalf of the State of Israel.

The long time and the fact that it has not been possible to obtain a specific timeframe for what we call 'the examination process' led to the Public Security Minister's turning to reserve Brig.-Gen. Gal Hirsch, who was ready and willing to carry out the mission, despite the major damage that was caused to him and his family, and to inform him that due to this he was compelled to ask that his name be withdrawn.

I have no doubt that we will yet hear much from Gal Hirsch. I would like the Israeli people to yet benefit from his talents, experience and abilities."
