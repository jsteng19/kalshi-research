Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with Palestinian Authority Chairman Abu Mazen and told him, "I expect you to assist in returning the abducted youths and in apprehending the kidnappers. The Hamas kidnappers came from territory under Palestinian Authority control and returned to territory under Palestinian Authority control. This incident exposes the true face of the terrorism that we are fighting against. Terrorists abduct innocent Israeli children while we save the lives of ill Palestinian children in our hospitals. This is the difference between our humanitarian policy and the murderous terrorism that is attacking us."

Prime Minister Netanyahu added, "The consequences of the partnership with Hamas must be understood; it is bad for Israel, bad for the Palestinians and bad for the region."
