Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the 2014 World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos, met with Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg and told her at the start of their meeting: "I appreciate the fact that there's much greater balance in Norway, I think that balance and fairness is something that is good on its own, but also good for peace. One thing that has been demonstrated is that the Palestinian-Israeli question is not the core of the conflicts in the Middle East. The imploding regimes in the Middle East have nothing to do with Israel and the Palestinians. We have to solve our problems for ourselves but not because it will stabilize the rest of the Middle East, that's a bigger job."

Norwegian Prime Minister Solberg replied, "It's a challenging time in the Middle East, in a lot of areas, not just the Palestinian-Israeli question, but the whole region is in the way of big changes like the situation in Syria, the refugee crisis out of Syria. There's a lot of instability so any positive news we'll get of getting more stable and new development will be good."
