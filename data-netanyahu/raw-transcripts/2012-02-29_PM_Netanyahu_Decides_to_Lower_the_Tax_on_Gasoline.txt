Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today, decided to lower the tax on gasoline by NIS 0.10. The price of a liter of gasoline will thus rise to NIS 7.74 (self-service).

In the next two months, the Finance Ministry will formulate proposals in order to find sources of financing to deal with the price of fuel.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said, "While the state has no control over the price of petroleum in the world, we do not have to tax every price increase."
