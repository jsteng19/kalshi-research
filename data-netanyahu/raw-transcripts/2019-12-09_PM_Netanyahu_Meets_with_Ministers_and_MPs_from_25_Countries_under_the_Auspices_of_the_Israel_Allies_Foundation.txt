Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem, met with a delegation of ministers and MPs from 25 countries under the auspices of the Israel Allies Foundation. IAF President Josh Reinstein also attended the meeting. The visitors presented their signatures against the EU court decision to label products from the Golan Heights, eastern Jerusalem, and Judea and Samaria. Prime Minister Netanyahu: "There are two kinds of friends â€“ friends of interest and friends of values. Sometimes they intersect as well. What is important about this group is that it is, first of all, based on common values. Even though Israel is denigrated and vilified, you know the truth. There is no substitute for speaking the truth in the face of lies." In response to a question about the American administration's statement on the legality of the settlements, Prime Minister Netanyahu said that it was very important because it reflected historical fact. He noted that we are not conquerors of a foreign country, declared that this has been our homeland since the patriarch Abraham came here 3,500 years ago and reminded the parliamentarians that the word 'Jew' comes from 'Judea'. The Prime Minister added that while we are not trying to expel anyone, neither will anyone expel us. Therefore, he said, President Trump's statement was a very important contribution to the truth. He urged the visitors to stand alongside Israel and the truth.
