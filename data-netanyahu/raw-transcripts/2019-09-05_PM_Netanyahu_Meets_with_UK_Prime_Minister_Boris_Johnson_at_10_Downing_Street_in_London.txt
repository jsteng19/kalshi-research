Prime Minister Netanyahu, at 10 Downing Street in London, met with UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and told him at the start of their meeting: "Boris, it's always a pleasure to see you, but especially now in your role as Prime Minister. I want to say that you've been a great friend of the Jewish people and Israel. I applaud your staunch stance against antisemitism and your support for Israel's security. Our relations are at an all-time high: economically, trade, technology, defense cooperation. These are all great things. It's not that we lack challenges. We have the challenge of Iran's aggression and terrorism, and I'd like to talk to you about how we can work together to counter these things for the benefit of peace. And I want to thank you for this opportunity to do so."
