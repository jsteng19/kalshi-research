Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today: "The abuse of helpless toddlers is an unforgiveable crime. I just spoke with the minister responsible for liaison between the government and the Knesset, David Amsalem, and coalition chairman Mickey Zohar and instructed them to immediately advance legislation to make the punishment for these crimes more severe. We will not tolerate this unacceptable phenomenon and we will fight it with every tool at our disposal."
