Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today:

"My wife Sara and I send heartfelt condolences to the families of Ohad Yahalomi, Tsahi Idan, Shlomo Mantzur and Itzik Elgarat, of blessed memory, our four deceased hostages who were returned to Israel from Hamas captivity last night.

May their memories be blessed. May G-d avenge them.

Dear families, we are in pain with you. The entire people of Israel embrace you and share in your mourning.

I promise that we will continue to take relentless action until we return them all, until we bring all of our sons and daughters back home."
