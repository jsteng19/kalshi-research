Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcomed the decision by the Jewish National Fund General Assembly to approve the new agreement between the JNF and the State of Israel. The prime minister, who appeared before the GA yesterday personally thanked Chairman Effie Stenzler for his leadership and responsibility in leading the move.

After lengthy negotiations, the Government and the JNF Board of Directors formulated an agreement that enables the continuation of the historic partnership between the State of Israel and the JNF.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said: "This is an excellent agreement for both the JNF and the State. The agreement creates a stable basis for the continued realization of the Zionist goal of developing the Land, including the continued planting of forests, and the preservation of its land reserves, for the future generations. The agreement will also allow the JNF to live up to its founding principles and maintain the scope of its holdings."

Approval of the agreement advances the reforms at the Israel Lands Administration, that are designed – first and foremost – to transfer to citizens full title over their residences which are built on ILA land. The reforms will also put an end to the bureaucracy and to the ILA's interference in citizens' lives, and is expected to lead to increasing the supply of apartments on the market, as well as to a decline in prices.

In the framework of the agreement, the JNF will transfer to the State lands in those areas which have already been populated in exchange for open land in the Negev and the Galilee , as well as appropriate monetary compensation. This is in order to assure the continuation of its activity in realizing the Zionist vision.

It should be emphasized that undeveloped land reserves in the center of the country will remain in JNF hands. Thus the JNF will maintain its economic strength for many years.
