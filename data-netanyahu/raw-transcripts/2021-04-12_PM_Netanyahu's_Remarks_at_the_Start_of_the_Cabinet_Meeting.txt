Following are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahuâ€™s remarks at the start of the Cabinet meeting, this evening:

"On the eve of Memorial Day we witnessed a shocking incident. Itzik Saidyan, an IDF Golani Brigade soldier from Operation Protective Edge, set himself on fire as a result of great mental distress. Unfortunately I know that he is not the only one among our soldiers who is in such distress.

Earlier this evening I spoke with handicapped IDF veterans organization chairman Idan Kleiman. I expressed my profound shock over the incident and also said that I was committed to carrying out a comprehensive reform of the way we deal with handicapped IDF veterans and our wounded. I am certain that I reflect the view of very many among you."
