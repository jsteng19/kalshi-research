Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu:

"I was outraged to hear of the savage murder of an 84 year old priest, Jacques Hamel, as he knelt by the altar of his church in France. ISIS proved once again that there is no limit to its barbarism. This horrific terror attack will only further unite the civilized world. Together, we will vanquish this evil."
