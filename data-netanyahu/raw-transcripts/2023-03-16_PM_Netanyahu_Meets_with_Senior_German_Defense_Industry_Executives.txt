Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening, met with over 30 senior defense industry executives from the ground, sea, air and space sectors, as well as from defense industry economic organizations.

The meeting was held following the successful meeting between Prime Minister Netanyahu and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in which they discussed the common security challenges in the near future, and which was part of the emphasis on the security arena that featured prominently in the Prime Minister's visit to Berlin.

During the closed event for the German business leaders, Prime Minister Netanyahu shared Israel's long experience in the security field and discussed the importance of the special relationship between Germany, Israel and Europe at this time. A large portion of the discussion was devoted to the possibility of cooperation between the countries via the German and European defense industries.

Additional background:

Israel and Germany have a longstanding security relationship with cross-sector cooperation. This network has currently peaked in the negotiations for the German acquisition of the Arrow 3 system, a strategic air defense system against long-range threats, the urgency of which for German national security was also raised in in Prime Minister Netanyahu's conversation with German Chancellor Scholz.

The warm bilateral security relations constitute an excellent starting point for the Israeli defense industry regarding the possibility of expanding in Europe at the present time.

Approximately one year ago, the German Chancellor declared a change in German security policy with the investment of $100 billion in the defense budget and a 50% increase in the defense budget to 25 of Germany's GDP.
