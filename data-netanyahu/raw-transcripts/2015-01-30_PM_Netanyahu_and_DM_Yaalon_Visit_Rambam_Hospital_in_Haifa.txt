Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon, today (Friday, 30 January 2015), at Rambam Hospital in Haifa, visited IDF soldiers who were wounded in Wednesday's terrorist attack in the north.

At the end of the visit, Prime Minister Netanyahu said, "Last night I spoke with the families of Yohai Kalangel and Dor Chaim Nini and I told them that I was speaking both as Prime Minister and as a member of their family, the family of the bereaved. I told them that I embrace them on behalf of the entire people of Israel. The Defense Minister and I have just visited with wounded. I was impressed by their extraordinary determination and their desire to return to serving with their comrades as quickly as possible.

We are under a prolonged attack organized by Iran. Iran is trying to uproot us from here; they will not succeed. We have put down roots here and we will continue to do so. We will continue to make our state flourish. We will continue to create new life. We are in the midst of a prolonged struggle with the same Iran that has opened new fronts against us and which is promoting terrorism across the Middle East and throughout the entire world. This is the same Iran which the major powers are now making an agreement with, an agreement that will leave it with the ability to develop nuclear bombs. This is an agreement that we oppose and this is the main issue. It is possible to resolve procedural problems regarding my appearance in the US. But if Iran arms itself with nuclear weapons, this will be much more difficult to resolve, and this is what we oppose and what we are focusing on."
