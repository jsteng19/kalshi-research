Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the 2014 World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos, met with Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott. At the start of their meeting, Australian Prime Minister Abbott told Prime Minister Netanyahu, "I daresay you had an interesting day. I want to stress the affinity of Australia to Israel and remind you that apart from Israel, Australia is the only country on earth that's had a Jewish person as Commander in Chief of the army, Chief Justice and Head of State." Prime Minister Netanyahu replied, "I'm aware of that and that's another reason for this great partnership, and I appreciate it and your friendship very much."
