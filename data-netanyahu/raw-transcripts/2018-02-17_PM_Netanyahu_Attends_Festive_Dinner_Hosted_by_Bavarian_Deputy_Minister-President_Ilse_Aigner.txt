Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara attended a festive dinner hosted by Bavarian Deputy Minister-President and Economics, Media, Energy and Technology Minister Ilse Aigner, at the Kaisersaal Residenz palace. Prime Minister and Mrs. Netanyahu were invited as the guests of honor. The dinner was also attended by heads of state, defense ministers, foreign ministers and other VIPs. The Ewald von Kleist Award was given to US Sen. John McCain.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"I have drawn tremendous inspiration from the courage of John McCain. Courage, the Romans said, is not the only virtue, but it’s the one that guarantees all the others.

Security is not the only aspect of policy, but it is the one that ensures that all others’ good policies are possible, for without security, we will deteriorate very rapidly into a world of chaos, tyranny and violence. Security comes first. This is the main message that I have today.

We must stop radical regimes from threatening our security. We must prevent them from getting nuclear weapons, and we must defeat the terrorists.

We’ll talk about that tomorrow, but tonight I want to join all of you in a salute to the hero of our times who understood and understands security, Senator John McCain."
