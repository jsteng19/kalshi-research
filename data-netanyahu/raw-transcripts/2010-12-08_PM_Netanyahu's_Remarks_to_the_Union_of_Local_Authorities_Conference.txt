Following are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks to the Union of Local Authorities conference in Herzliya:

"We were together in recent days and I saw you in the field and you worked in an exemplary manner; I salute you. During the emergency, the systems worked with great coordination. You knew what to do. You managed the crisis with equanimity and when the main mission was to evacuate people who were in danger, you knew what to do.

This system worked very well. You were superb. All of Israel takes its hat off to you. 190 of 219 people who were eligible for immediate assistance have already received the money and this is how it should work.

Where possible, mayors need to receive the authority and the tools to carry out the rules because you know your communities. There are certain services that you do not need to manage, neither the police, nor the military, nor the fire services, because they are national services. They need one centralized, national command.

Therefore, within ten days, I will submit to the Cabinet a draft decision on a national fire service that will be composed of, first of all, a ground-based array, but it is not enough. What we also need is an aerial fire service. This is the solution for massive fires like the one we saw on Mt. Carmel . Within the same period of time, my Military Secretary, Maj.-Gen. Yohanan Loaker, in coordination with all of the relevant officials, will submit a draft decision on establishing an aerial fire service. These two will direct the State of Israel's fire services to better meet our genuine needs."
