Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, at Capitol Hill:

"This is a difficult day. We lost five of our heroic fighters. The bereavement and pain are afflicting us, all parts of the nation. At the same time, we are also determined, not just to send – of course – our condolences to the families, whom we embrace, but to achieve our objectives for the war in Gaza: To release all of our hostages, to eliminate Hamas's military and governing capabilities, and – of course – to ensure that Gaza will not constitute a threat to Israel.

This means – there will be no Hamas. This must be understood. This is not just something that we are saying, nor will it be. This entails a certain strategy, which I will not detail here. This entails efforts, some of which are painful, and some which will be very painful to Hamas, but the end result will be the release of all our hostages, and the defeat and dismantling of Hamas. Gaza will no longer constitute a threat to Israel, and we have yet to finish the work."
