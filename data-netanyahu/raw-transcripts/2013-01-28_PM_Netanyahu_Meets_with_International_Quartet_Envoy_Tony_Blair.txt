Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, met with international quartet envoy Tony Blair. The Prime Minister said: "The Middle East doesn't stop for elections, everything continues. We need to work on peace and security and there's no better person to work with than you."

Envoy Blair said, "I look forward to working with you on these peace and security issues in the time ahead. We've got many challenges but I'm sure they can be overcome with good will and hard work."

Envoy Blair also expressed sharp reservations over the cartoon that was published in The Sunday Times, especially given that it was published on International Holocaust Remembrance Day.
