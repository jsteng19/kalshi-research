Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this evening welcomed

the International Monetary Fund report according to which growth in the Israeli economy for 2011 has increased and will stand at 4.8%.

He said that the increase in the growth forecast constitutes additional confidence in the Government's responsible and successful handling of the Israeli economy. "The Government is committed to continuing this policy and ensuring continued growth and more jobs in the future as well. I am certain that the Trajtenberg committee's recommendations, which will also lead to a change in priorities, will do so while maintaining a stable and healthy economy," the Prime Minister said.
