Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, spoke by telephone with German Chancellor Angela Merkel who reiterated her unreserved support for Israel's right to defend itself. The Prime Minister thanked her for the action of her government against antisemitic elements in Germany and emphasized that Hamas is committing a double war crime by firing missiles from inside civilian populations and by using civilians in Gaza as human shields.

Last night (Sunday), Prime Minister Netanyahu spoke to Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and thanked him for his country's support of Israel's right to self-defense in light of the terrorist organizations' firing at Israel's cities. The Prime Minister noted that Israel would continue to strike at Hamas and Islamic Jihad in order to restore the quiet and security to the citizens of Israel.
