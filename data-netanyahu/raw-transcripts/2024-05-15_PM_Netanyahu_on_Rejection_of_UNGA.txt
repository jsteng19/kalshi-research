Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Rejection of UNGA 10 May Decision: " We will not reward the terrible massacre of October 7. We will not allow them to establish a terrorist state from which they will be able to vigorously attack us."

The Government, today, unanimously approved Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's proposal to reject the UN General Assembly decision of 10 May 2024.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"Today, the Government opposed last week's UN decision to advance recognition of a Palestinian state. We will not reward the terrible massacre of October 7, which 80% of Palestinians, both in Judea and Samaria, and Gaza, support. We will not allow them to establish a terrorist state from which they will be able to vigorously attack us.

Nobody will prevent us, will prevent Israel, from realizing our basic right to self-defense â€“ neither the UN General Assembly nor any other body. We will stand together with our head held high in order to defend our country."

In the framework of the rejection, the Government has determined:

1. To reject the UN General Assembly decision of 10 May 2024 to upgrade the status of the Palestinian Authority and give it additional privileges, which are usually reserved for UN member states.

2. To determine that nothing in the aforesaid decision will change the status of the territories in question; nothing in it will grant any right, or detract from any rights of the State of Israel and Jewish People in the Land of Israel.

3. To determine that the aforesaid decision will not constitute a basis for future negotiations, and does not advance a peaceful solution.
