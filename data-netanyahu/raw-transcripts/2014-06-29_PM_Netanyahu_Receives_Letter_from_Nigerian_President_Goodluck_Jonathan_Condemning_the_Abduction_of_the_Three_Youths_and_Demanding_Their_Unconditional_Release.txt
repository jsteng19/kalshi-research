Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu received a letter from Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan in which the latter – on behalf of himself and the Nigerian people – condemns the abduction of the three youths and demands their unconditional release. Following is an excerpt from the letter:

"In behalf of the government and people of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, I write to express my empathy with the Government and people of the State Israel on the abduction of three teenage Israeli students. Given Nigeria's experience with the scourge of terrorism, I assure you that we are in solidarity with you, as we believe that any act of terrorism against any nation or group is an act against our common humanity. We unequivocally condemn this dastardly act and demand that the children are released unconditionally by their abductors."
