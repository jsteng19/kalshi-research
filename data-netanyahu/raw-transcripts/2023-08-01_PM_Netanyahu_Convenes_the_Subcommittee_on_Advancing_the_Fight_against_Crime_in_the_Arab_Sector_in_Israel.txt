Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today , at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem, convened the Subcommittee on Advancing the Fight against Crime in the Arab Sector in Israel. The Justice Minister, the National Security Minister, the Director of the National Security Council and the Director of the ISA reviewed their activity on the issue.

Prime Minister Netanyahu directed that several efforts be advanced and that an additional meeting be held soon in order to strengthen the actions of the law enforcement agencies in this fight.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"It is unacceptable that the Arab sector suffers from the acts of murder and violence that out-of-control criminal organizations are responsible for.

This week, the Knesset completed legislation on two important laws: The Law for the Fight against 'Protection' and a law that will restrict the use of airsoft guns.

We will continue to take unceasing action to continuously and effectively strike at the criminal organizations in the Arab sector."

Also participating in the discussion were the Director of the National Security Council, the Prime Minister's Chief of Staff, the Prime Minister's Office Director General and additional officials.
