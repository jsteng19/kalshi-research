Prime Minister Netanyahu and his wife Sara, at the David Citadel Hotel in Jerusalem, attended an event marking the one year anniversary of the US Embassy moving to Jerusalem and the declaration regarding the move of the US Ambassador's official residence to Jerusalem. Also in attendance were US Ambassador to Israel David Friedman and his wife Tammy, as well as Guatemalan First Lady Patricia Morales and Guatemalan Ambassador to Israel Mario Bucaro. Prime Minister Netanyahu: "There is a new efflorescence, a new renaissance of relations between us and many of our Arab neighbors, and many non-Arab Muslim countries. We are united in our desire to stop Iranian aggression. Israel and all the countries of the region and all the countries who seek peace in the world should stand together with the United States against Iranian aggression. We have to keep on strengthening the State of Israel and keep on strengthening the indispensable alliance with America."
