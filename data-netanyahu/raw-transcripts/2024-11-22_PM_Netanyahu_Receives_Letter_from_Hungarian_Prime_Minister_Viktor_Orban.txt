Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has sent a letter (see attached) to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to stand by and support him and the State of Israel, and to invite him to make a diplomatic visit to Hungary.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"I thank Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban for the warm support for me and the State of Israel.

Against the shameful weakness of those who have lined up alongside the outrageous decision against the State of Israel's right to defend itself, Hungary – like our friends in the US – has shown moral clarity and steadfastness on the side of justice and the truth."
