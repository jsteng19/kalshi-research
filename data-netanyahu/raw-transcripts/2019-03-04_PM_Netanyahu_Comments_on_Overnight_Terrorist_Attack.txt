Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this morning, at the start of his meeting with Samoan Prime Minister Tuilaepa Aiono Sailele Malielegaoi, made the following remarks:

"This morning IDF soldiers acted quickly and eliminated the terrorists who threatened to run them over. We send our best wishes for a quick recovery to the officer who was wounded and will do everything to speed up the demolition of the homes of these murderers, such as the murderer of Ori Ansbacher.

I have ordered that the demolitions of these homes be speeded up in the context of the restrictions of the judicial system. We are determined to continue our vigorous struggle against the murderers and against terrorism everywhere."
