"We’ve just come from a very moving ceremony in honor of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. It was deeply meaningful. I think she was a great leader, not only an economic leader, but a world leader helping along with President Ronald Reagan to end the Cold War bloodlessly. That changed history. She evidently changed the history of Britain, the history of Britain’s economy, but in doing so and in doing everything else that she did as she led this country, she inspired many around the world with conviction, determination and courage."
