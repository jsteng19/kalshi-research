Following are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting today:

"Today, we will submit for Cabinet approval the appointment of Maj.-Gen. Benny Gantz as the next Chief-of-Staff of the State of Israel. He is an outstanding officer and an experienced commander.

Maj.-Gen. Gantz has considerable operational and organizational experience. He has all the necessary qualities to be an outstanding commander of the IDF. This appointment will enhance the stability of the IDF, which is always important, but is especially important at this time of deep shocks in our region.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank Lt.-Gen. Gaby Ashkenazi, who is concluding his outstanding term as Chief-of-Staff. We congratulate him on his achievements and wish him success in the future.

Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak resigned over the weekend and left Cairo. The Government of Israel welcomes the Egyptian military statement that Egypt will continue to honor its peace agreement with Israel.

The peace agreement with Israel has stood for many years. During this period, all Egyptian governments have upheld and advanced it and we believe that it is the cornerstone of peace and stability, not only between the two countries, but in the entire Middle East as well."
