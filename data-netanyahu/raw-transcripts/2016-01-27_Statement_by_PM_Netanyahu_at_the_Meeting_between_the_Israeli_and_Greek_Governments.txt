Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today at the meeting between the Israeli and Greek governments, made the following statement:

"Our cooperation with Greece and Cyprus stands on its own. While we believe that it should have happened some time ago, we are pleased by the current progress. It does not depend on our efforts to normalize our relations with Turkey. We are trying to do this. I do not know if we will succeed but I think that we will continue our efforts to do so. We must ensure that Israel's interests are upheld. Turkey and Israel have had excellent relations in previous years. We did not want to see them deteriorate and we did not cause this deterioration in relations. We will welcome any change in policy."
