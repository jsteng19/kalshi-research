"I am very proud of Israeli agriculture and the developments from the Volcani Center. Israeli farmers are incredibly creative; this is a global force. I was aware of this at Milan Expo and more recently at Davos. Many countries, from every continent, want to benefit from our innovations, your innovations. I have revolutionary thoughts about how to use this ability on the commercial, international and diplomatic level. To his end I am interested in forging a partnership between the Volcani Center and countries that are interested in this and thereby greatly expand your activity both nationally and internationally. This is a great strength for the State of Israel. This is especially welcome on Tu B'Shvat. Thank you very much. Have a pleasant holiday."
