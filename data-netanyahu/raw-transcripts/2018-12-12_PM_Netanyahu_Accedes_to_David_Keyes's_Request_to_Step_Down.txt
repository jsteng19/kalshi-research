Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has acceded to David Keyesâ€™s request to step down as Adviser to the Prime Minister for Public Diplomacy and Media.

"I thank David Keyes for his great contribution to Israel's information effort.

David pioneered groundbreaking videos which presented basic facts about Israel and enabled me to present Israel's policies to a global audience.

Millions of people around the world viewed these videos with appreciation, and the messages aimed at the Iranian public were received with particular enthusiasm by many Iranian citizens.

All this attests to David's talents and his contribution. I wish him much success on his future course."

"I thank the Israel Civil Service Commission for closing its probe against me, stating 'There is no evidence or even a shred of evidence' of wrongdoing as an employee of the government. Having been deeply inspired by how Israeli innovation is improving the lives of people around the world, I have decided to pursue new opportunities in the private sector. I thank Prime Minister Netanyahu for giving me the great honor of serving him and the State of Israel."
