Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Health Minister Yuli Edelstein visited a Maccabi Healthcare Services clinic in Ramle where they met the 2,000,000th person in Israel to be vaccinated. Also participating in the visit were Ramle Mayor Michael Videl, Maccabi Chairman Prof. Moshe Ruach and Maccabi CEO Ran Saar. Prime Minister Netanyahu: "I have held many conversations with the Health Minister and the top professionals in order to implement the Green Passport plan as quickly as possible, which will enable us to begin restoring life to normal. Even as we do this we will need to continue wearing masks and following the rules because the virus is still here and will still be among the younger population which has not been vaccinated. I ask you to be strict about this. There is no doubt that we are seeing the light at the end of the tunnel and if we all take care to be vaccinated and keep the rules, we will be the first country in the world to emerge from this. I turn your attention to the fact that in several of the main countries in Europe they are talking about lockdowns into March and April. Not with us. But we still need to follow the rules and lower morbidity. We will shorten the period of restrictions as much as we can. Nevertheless, we are asking for your full cooperation both in being vaccinated and in following the rules. We will continue on to the next million, we are on the way." "Every hour or two, I receive a telephone call from world leaders, some of them are known to you, asking for our assistance. Israel has become the world champion in vaccines but we also have good friends and I tell them that we will help them as much as we can. But we must first see to our citizens without exception in a completely egalitarian manner. We assist others as much as we can, like we did at the outset â€“ in talks and cooperation with whomever we can, including our neighbors."
