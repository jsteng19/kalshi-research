statement by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday:

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu:

"Tomorrow will be a very difficult day for the State of Israel. A wrenching day, a day of grief. We are bringing home four of our beloved hostages, deceased.

We embrace the families, and the heart of the entire nation is torn. My own heart is torn. So is yours. And all of the world's heart should be torn, because this demonstrates who we are dealing with, what we are dealing with â€” with such monsters.

We are grieving, we are in pain, but we are also determined to ensure that such a thing never happens again".
