Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has decided to appoint Brig.-Gen. (ret.) Avriel Bar-Yosef as his National Security Adviser and Director of the National Security Council.

Bar-Yosef is 61, married, the father of four and the grandfather of three.

From 2009 until approximately six months ago he served as Deputy Director of the National Security Council (NSC). From 2004-2009, he was director of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. He served in the IDF for 25 years, was discharged with the rank of Brigadier-General, and – in his last post – was head of equipment for the navy.

Avriel Bar-Yosef holds a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Glasgow and a master's degree in engineering from the University of Michigan.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"Brig.-Gen. (ret.) Bar-Yosef has considerable and rich security and diplomatic experience both in the IDF and the NSC. In the face of the complex challenges facing the State of Israel, I am certain that as NSC Director, he will know how to translate his experience and talents for the benefit of Israel's security."

Avriel Bar-Yosef:

"I thank the Prime Minister for the confidence that he is giving me. I am aware of the magnitude of the responsibility and the challenges facing us. I will do whatever is necessary to succeed in my post for the State of Israel."
