Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem, met with NATO Deputy Secretary General Mircea Geoană.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"I'm very happy to see my old friend, and who's now the deputy secretary general of NATO. We have excellent relations with NATO and excellent cooperation, and I look forward to increasing it even further. We have great opportunities for peace in our area, but we also have great challenges, principally from Iran and of course from other areas as well.Israel and NATO cooperate on both fronts, deterring, or removing the dangers and seizing the opportunities."NATO Deputy Secretary General Geoană:"Dear Prime Minister. Thank you for receiving us and my delegation. I'm here to mark a new beginning in a very robust partnership between NATO and the State of Israel. We share many of the concerns that Israel shares. We see authoritarian regimes like Iran and North Korea and Russia posing challenges to our security both in Europe and also in the Middle East.I'm here to reconfirm the strong interest that we have in building upon the exceptional technological sophistication of your great nation. I chair innovation in NATO and through the new partnership that we are about to launch in the next few weeks, I know that we'll be building our partnership to the next level.And I'm very privileged to be in Israel, a country that we admire, respect, and hope to work even closer with."Also participating in the meeting were the Prime Minister's Chief of Staff, the Director of the National Security Council, the Prime Minister's Military Secretary, the Head of the National Public Diplomacy Directorate and the Israeli Ambassador to the UN and NATO.
