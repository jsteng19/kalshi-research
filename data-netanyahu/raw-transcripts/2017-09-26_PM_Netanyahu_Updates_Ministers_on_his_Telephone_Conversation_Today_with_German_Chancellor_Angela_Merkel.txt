Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the weekly Cabinet meeting, updated ministers on his telephone conversation today with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said that Chancellor Merkel had been a true friend of the State of Israel and the Jewish People for many years and was a great leader of Germany and Europe. "I congratulated her on her victory. The State of Israel is certain that under her leadership the special relationship between Germany and Israel will continue to deepen and prosper. I called on the new government that will be established to act to strengthen those forces in Germany that accept the historic responsibility," the Prime Minister said.

Israel is concerned over the rise of anti-Semitism in recent years among political elements from the right and left and among Islamic elements. Israel rejects attempts to deny the Holocaust. There are two different things â€“ Holocaust denial and denial of responsibility. Chancellor Merkel said that as soon as the new government is established she would like to hold the G2G meeting that was postponed from May of this year.

Prime Minister Netanyahu added, "I also emphasized our policy regarding Iran's attempts to base itself in Syria."
