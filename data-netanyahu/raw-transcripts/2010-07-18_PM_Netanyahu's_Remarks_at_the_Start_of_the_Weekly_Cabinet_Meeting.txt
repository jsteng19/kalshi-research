Following are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s remarks at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting today:

"In a few hours, I will travel to Cairo to meet with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. Under President Mubarak's leadership, Egypt is a main factor in advancing peace and stability in the region. I intend to speak with President Mubarak about ways to accelerate the entry into direct negotiations between us and the Palestinians. I know that Egypt is interested in advancing the diplomatic process like we are, and I hope that in the wake of

my meeting with US President Barack Obama in Washington

, we will find ways to advance this common goal.

Today, we will begin to discuss – I do not know whether we will finish the discussion today because our meeting will be short – the proposal of a ministerial team on formulating a new policy regarding migration into the State of Israel. This is a national issue of the highest importance; it has both demographic and humanitarian aspects. In effect, we are the only western country that lacks a clear migration policy. Today, we will start the discussion in order to correct this. Currently, there is no unified policy regarding entry and exit from the State of Israel.

I would like to thank Justice Minister Yaakov Neeman and the ministerial team that worked to formulate the new policy. Its principal underlying idea is that the conditions of entry into Israel should conform to our national interests, first and foremost providing security and ensuring the Jewish and democratic character of the country. Additionally, on the table before us are conclusions regarding actions the Government can take in order to reduce the number of illegal labor-seeking migrants who infiltrate into the State of Israel.

We will discuss these matters until I must leave for Egypt and – if necessary – will hold a second meeting on this important issue."
