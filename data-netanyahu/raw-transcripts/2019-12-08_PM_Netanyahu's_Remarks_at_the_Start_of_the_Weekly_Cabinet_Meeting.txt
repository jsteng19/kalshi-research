Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting, made the following remarks: "Last week I held important conversations with the leaders of the US and Russia. I spoke with President Trump and President Putin and I met in Lisbon with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. One topic headlined all of these talks – Iran. Iran is continuing its aggression in the Middle East and is even increasing it. Yesterday there was a bloody attack in Baghdad in which over 20 innocent Iraqi demonstrators were murdered. I would like to tell you that there are growing indications that this murderous attack in Baghdad was carried out by Shiite Iraqi militias on direct instruction from the Iranian Revolutionary Guards. At this time, against this murderousness, the pressure on Iran must be increased. This is what I am calling on the countries of Europe to do. I would also like to make it clear that with or without the countries of Europe, Israel will not allow Iran – at any stage – to develop nuclear weapons. On the issue of Gaza, I would like to clarify – there will be no arrangement if the firing continues. On the contrary, the terrorists in Gaza will yet feel blows from our arm. What they absorbed three weeks ago in Operation Black Belt, in which we targeted the leader of Islamic Jihad and dozens of militants from the organization, was just for starters. I have instructed the Defense Minister and the IDF to prepare accordingly. I will not go into details about our plans. We will continue to guard the security of Israel."
