It is not that you do not have other work, but in the moment of crisis, you entered the picture and ran to the line of fire and simply did amazing work, with great initiative and responsibility. In the moments of crisis, you also made important decisions and set a direction that we in the Government adopted. The fact that you answered the call during the peak of the crisis is a certificate of honor for you and the State of Israel for finding people like you."
