Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara, today, at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem, met with Shlomi Ziv, who was rescued from Hamas captivity in a daring operation – Operation Arnon, in which fighters from the Special Anti-Terrorism Unit, the ISA and the IDF all took part, and with members of his family – his wife Miran, his mother Roseta and his sisters Revital and Adi. Prime Minister Netanyahu to Shlomi Ziv: "We met on the day you were freed. You look great. I must tell you – there is light radiating from your face. I simply enjoy seeing this great joy." Sara Netanyahu met personally with the Ziv family and said [[translated from Hebrew]: "What a joy it is to see you; how we sat and spoke about you. What a joy it is to see your mother. This is simply a dream come true. The story of your rescue operation – I do not think that there is any other army in the world that would have dared and also acted."
