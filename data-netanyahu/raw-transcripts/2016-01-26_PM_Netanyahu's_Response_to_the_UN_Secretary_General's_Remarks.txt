Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today responded to UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon's remarks:

"The UN Secretary General's remarks give a tailwind to terrorism. There is no justification for terrorism. The Palestinian murderers do not want to build a state â€“ they want to destroy a state and they say this openly. They want to murder Jews simply because they are Jews and they say this openly. They do not murder for peace and they do not murder for human rights.

The UN lost its neutrality and moral force a long time ago and the Secretary General's remarks do not improve the situation."
