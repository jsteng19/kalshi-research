Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, before the onset of the Sabbath, called Brig.-Gen. (Res.) Shalom Ben-Aryeh in order to commend the rescue mission in Haiti. Prime Minister Netanyahu heard that the Israeli hospital in Haiti was the only one able to care for the very seriously wounded. The Prime Minister asked that Brig.-Gen. (Res.) Ben-Aryeh convey the thanks of the entire country to the mission. "You are doing holy work," the Prime Minister said, "You are saving lives and bringing honor to the State of Israel. Everyone here in the country is proud of you. Shabbat Shalom and continue to do this wonderful work." Prime Minister Netanyahu told Brig.-Gen. (Res.) Ben-Aryeh to contact him with any request for the Israeli mission so that it may continue its important work in Haiti.
