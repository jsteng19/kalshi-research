Following is an excerpt from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks at the start of the Cabinet meeting:

"We will not repeat the mistake that other countries made when they sought ideal solutions for their gas and sometimes for their oil and as a result of which both the gas and the oil have remained below the seabed or underground.

They had an ideal solution that was not realistic. In this situation they could pat themselves on the back for wanting the most competitive framework that was never realized. Many years have passed in which many countries have not seen a bit of energy from these sources.

We will not do this. We will act in accordance with a prudent consideration that balances competition and worthwhileness and extracts the gas from the depths of the sea. There is an outline here that is the result of expedited work by various experts in the field. They did not all agree. To my regret, the head of the Israel Antitrust Authority did not agree, but we are going forward.

I will not allow any consideration or pressure, or populist moves to prevent the flow of gas to the State of Israel. We will extract this gas from the depths of the sea, we will bring it to the citizens of Israel and we will make society as a whole better off."
