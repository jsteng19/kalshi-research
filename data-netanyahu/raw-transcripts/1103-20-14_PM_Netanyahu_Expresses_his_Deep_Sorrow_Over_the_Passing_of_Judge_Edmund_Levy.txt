Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expresses his deepest sorrow over the passing of Judge Edmund Levy. The Prime Minister said: "I bow my head on the passing of Judge Edmund Levy.

He was among Israel's most senior judges. Edmund Levy passed through all staes of the legal system up to serving on the Supreme Court where he left a deep mark. Edmund Levy was a shirp and independent thinker and had an exceptional intellect, as well as the ability to analyze complex situation. He was as straight as a ruler and did not hesitate to express his opinions time and again on controversial issues.

The People, State and land of Israel were among his chief concerns. May his memory be blessed."
