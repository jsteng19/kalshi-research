Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, commended the quick work of the ISA in apprehending the terrorist who murdered Danny Gonen. "On the day of the murder, I said that we would catch the reprehensible and abhorrent murderer and the ISA and IDF did so in a short time. Now that it becomes clear that this was a Palestinian Authority man it will be interesting to see if the Palestinian Authority condemns the murder or continues its silence. Those who do not attack terrorism will, in the end, be attacked by it," the Prime Minister said.
