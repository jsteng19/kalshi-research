Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon visited the IDF Hermon Brigade base where they were briefed by IDF Deputy Chief-of-Staff Maj.-Gen. Yair Golan and GOC Northern Command Maj.-Gen. Aviv Kochavi, and met with local council chairmen from the area.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said, "I came here today with our Defense Minister to view the IDF preparations against the new front, terror front, that Iran is seeking to establish here in the Golan Heights. This is in addition to the terror fronts they've already established in south Lebanon and in Gaza.

It's curious to me that in the face of this terror activity of Iran, both here in the region and throughout the world, leading countries in the world are not demanding that Iran cease this activity, but are racing to forge a deal that would enable Iran to have nuclear weapons, and that is the greatest danger of all.

Israel will oppose this deal, which is dangerous to us, dangerous to the region, dangerous to the world.

I take this opportunity to send my condolences to King Abdullah and the people of Jordan for the grisly murder of the air force pilot of the Jordanian air force. In the Islamic State of ISIS, they burn people alive; in the Islamic State of Tehran, they hang them from cranes in the public squares. Both are motivated by an extreme ideology of militant Islamic terrorism that has a cruelty that is unbounded.

But the greatest danger to the future and the security of the world is that this extremism will be backed up by nuclear weapons. This is something everyone must oppose."
