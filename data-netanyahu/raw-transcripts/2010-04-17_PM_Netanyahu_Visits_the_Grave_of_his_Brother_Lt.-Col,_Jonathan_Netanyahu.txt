Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sarah this evening visited the grave of

Lt.-Col. Jonathan (Yoni) Netanyahu

, who fell almost 34 years ago during the operation to free the hostages in Entebbe, in order to pay tribute to his memory and light a memorial candle.

The Netanyahus decided to visit the Mt. Herzl cemetery a day before the start of events to mark

Remembrance Day for the Fallen of Israel's Wars

out of consideration for the bereaved families and so that the public might not be delayed by the security arrangements for the Prime Minister.

Prime Minister Netanyahu was moved to see the citation that the IDF engraved on his brother's gravestone and the citations on the gravestones of other fallen soldiers. Lt.-Col. Netanyahu received the citation for rescuing a wounded comrade from behind Syrian lines during the 1973 Yom Kippur War.
