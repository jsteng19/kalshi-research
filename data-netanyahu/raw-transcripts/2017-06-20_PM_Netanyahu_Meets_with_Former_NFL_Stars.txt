Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, met with a delegation of former National Football League players, all of whom are members of the Professional Football Hall of Fame. The delegation is currently touring Israel at the initiative of New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft. Among the players are Joe Greene, Joe Montana, Jim Brown, Mike Singletary, Eric Dickerson and Roger Staubach.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"If you ask what is the policy? You seek peace but you've got to be strong. If you're not strong, you'll never get peace and if you're not strong, you'll be in war and turmoil. And the worst thing is – you lose. So, I'm sure that when you prepare for your games you don’t say: Well, do I need to be strong, fast and nimble? Is that a question? No. Your game is not different from ours. The only difference is: If we lose, the consequences are immutable. We had enough of that in our history. So, we won’t let that happen again."
