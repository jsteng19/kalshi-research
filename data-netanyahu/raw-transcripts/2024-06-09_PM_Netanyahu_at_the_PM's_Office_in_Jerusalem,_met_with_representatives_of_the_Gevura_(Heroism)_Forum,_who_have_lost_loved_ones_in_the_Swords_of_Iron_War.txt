PM Netanyahu at the PM's Office in Jerusalem, met with representatives of the Gevura ("Heroism") Forum, who have lost loved ones in the Swords of Iron War

The Prime Minister thanked the Forum representatives for seeking to support him over the successful operation to rescue the hostages, and for withstanding domestic and foreign pressure.

Prime Minister Netanyahu to the Forum representatives [translated from Hebrew]:

"We are committed to total victory. We do not want to – and cannot – abandon the arena, not just because of the wonderful boys who have fallen, but because this is the future of the country; we have no choice. Now, even if not everyone sees this, we see it. The majority sees it. A majority of the people sees it. A majority of the fighters sees it. The families in Israel, by the way non-Jews as well understand this, and we are committed to it.

We are also committed to returning the hostages in various ways, which I will not detail. Our future will not exist here against the axis of evil of Iran and its proxies if we simply bow our hands.

All of the things that are being discussed, if you mention the hostages deal, what is the main argument about? About Hamas's demand, which I regret also enjoys support in our areas, that we must commit to halting the war without having achieved our goals – eliminating Hamas and all the rest – I am not prepared, that is clear. Not just me, I think the entire public is not prepared. But I am standing up for my own. It is important to understand that there are other issues that are also important, but this is the most important.

Regarding management of the fighting, not everything that was done can be revealed but more than this, not everything that will be done can be revealed. We are currently in seven sectors. Just to understand, we are – first of all – against Hamas, against Hezbollah, against the Houthis, against the militias in Iraq and Syria, against Iran, in Judea and Samaria, and against the ICC, and all together. We are fighting on many fronts. This situation requires internal cohesion, if not of the entire people, then of most of the people in order to fight.

Everything is designed in order to squeeze, to uproot and destroy us. To me this is completely clear; therefore, I do not think of abandoning this arena even for a moment, and I certainly do not think that we can give up on our necessary victory, against all of these butchers first of all.

I greatly appreciate that you have come here. I appreciate all of our meetings. Your words are genuine and strong."

National Security Council Director Tzachi Hanegbi and the Prime Minister's Military Secretary, Maj.-Gen. Roman Gofman, also participated in the meeting.
