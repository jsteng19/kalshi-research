Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, at IDF Judea and Samaria Brigade headquarters, met with IDF soldiers from the Netzah Yehuda battalion. Following is an excerpt from his remarks:

"One of your comrades is fighting for his life and we are all praying for him. There have also been achievements. Those murderers were eliminated and I am certain that it is only a matter of time before we reach the third. Your activity is continuing. I spent today with your commanders, the Chief-of-Staff and GOC Central Command. We are full of appreciation for your activity and are absolutely certain of our ability to carry out the main mission.

The main mission is, first of all, to strike at terrorism, to maintain the security of the state and the settlers, and – to the extent possible – maintain quiet in this area, also with the Palestinian residents.

I am impressed that there are many developments and technology and in the end it will reach you at the checkpoints, on the roads or in the communities. Operational activity needs to be done in the best and most professional way possible and in the end with heart and soul. I think that it begins and ends with professionalism, and the readiness to stand in the breach. Each one of you knows this and this is why you are here.

Our entire pyramid is built on you, on the soldiers and commanders. We are adding considerable means and capabilities but in the end it is built on you. I would like to express great appreciation and to salute you, and the entire people of Israel join me."
