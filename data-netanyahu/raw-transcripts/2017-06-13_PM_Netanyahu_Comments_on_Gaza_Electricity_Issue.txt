Following is an excerpt from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks at the signing of a roof agreement for Be'er Yaakov:

"In recent days I have heard erroneous explanations regarding the issue of electricity in Gaza. It needs to be understood that the issue of electricity in Gaza is subject to a disagreement between the Palestinian Authority and Hamas. Hamas is demanding that the PA pay for the electricity and the PA is refusing to do so. This is an internal Palestinian argument. In any case, I would like to make it clear that Israel has no interest in escalation and any analysis to the contrary is mistaken. But we are interested in security and our policy on security is clear and unchanging."
