Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, at the Kirya in Tel Aviv, met with US Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC).

Prime Minister Netanyahu at the start of the meeting:

"Thank you. Senator Graham, Lindsey, I appreciate your personal support and the bipartisan support of the American people, represented by the administration, by both sides of Congress. We're absolutely committed to achieving our war goals, that is destroying Hamas, releasing our hostages, making sure Gaza doesn't become a threat again, and also making sure that we can return our citizens in the north and in the south. For that we'll apply maximum power with maximum precision everywhere that's needed."

Senator Graham:

"I'm more dedicated now to bringing stability to your country and this region, because I think Iran's goal is to destroy your efforts to reconcile with the Arab world. It's a nightmare for the ayatollah. It's an absolutely essential ingredient to a better more stable Mid-East and a safe and secure Israel and a prosperous Palestinian people.

I promise you, they will not have died in vain. We're going to do everything we can, on my end and I think working with the Biden administration, Mr. Prime Minister, to push forward to make Iran's worst nightmare real: The Arabs and the Israelis move toward the light."

Also participating in the meeting were the Strategic Affairs Minister, the Director of the National Security Council, the Prime Minister's Military Secretary and the Israeli Ambassador to the US.
