Prime Minister Netanyahu, prior to the landing of the first flight at Ramon Airport, which is named after Ilan and Asaf Ramon, spoke with the airport control tower:

"Ramon, this is Arkia 763. We are very moved to be on the first flight to Ramon Airport. We see you clearly. The airport is very important vis-Ã -vis our national security, the development of the Negev and Eilat, and the development of civil aviation. This truly is very, very moving. This moment and this airport cause us to remember Ilan, Asaf and Rona Ramon. The Ramon family will be with us here. We are due to land."
