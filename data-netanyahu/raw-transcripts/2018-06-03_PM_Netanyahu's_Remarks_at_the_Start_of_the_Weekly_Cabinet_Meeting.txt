PM Netanyahu at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting made the following remarks:

"Tomorrow I will leave for Europe to meet with three main leaders: Angela Merkel, Emmanuel Macron and Theresa May. While I will discuss with them developments in the region, the emphasis will be on Iran, first of all on continuing to block Iran's nuclear program.

Of course, I will reiterate an unchanging truth: Israel will not allow Iran to achieve nuclear weapons.

The second thing is the blocking of Iran's plans for expansion and aggression throughout the Middle East, especially in Syria. I will also insist on a basic principle: Israel retains – and will continue to retain – freedom of action against the establishment of an Iranian military presence anywhere in Syria.

I recently discussed these issues with Russian President Vladimir Putin and American Secretary of State Pompeo. These talks are very important for the security of Israel.

On another issue, I would like to make it clear: The Mossad is not a criminal organization. It is a splendid organization that does holy work in the fight against terrorism and other threats to the State of Israel, and we all salute it."
