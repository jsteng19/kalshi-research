The Cabinet, today, approved the proposal of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Benny Gantz and Finance Minister Yisrael Katz to implement the reform in the Defense Ministry Rehabilitation Division.

Prime Minister Netanyahu just met with Handicapped IDF Veterans Organization Chairman Idan Kleiman.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"Today's decision is gigantic news. I thank you and the Handicapped IDF Veterans Organization for the great effort to reach this day. This is the start of a major reform.

Reform is not only expressed in resources or responsibility or in overturning the order of things. In my opinion, it is expressed in overturning only one thing – the bureaucracy needs to serve you and not the other way round.

Handicapped IDF veterans are important and dear to us. The reform will ensure the assistance you deserve. We are committed to our heroic soldiers and fighters and will continue to act on your behalf and be with you however we can."

Handicapped IDF Veterans Organization Chairman Kleiman:

"Mr. Prime Minister, I would really like to thank you, the Defense Minister and the Finance Minister for rising to the occasion, and the Minister for Civilian Affairs, and all the ministries and teams. We worked very hard for this."

nder the decision, approximately NIS 300 million will be transferred immediately to the Rehabilitation Division with emphasis on treatment for those suffering from PTSD. This budget will be from the base of the state budget. At the same time, the Cabinet has appointed the Defense Minister to advance the relevant legislative changes that will assist handicapped IDF veterans and to move forward on implementing the 'One Spirit' reform of issues that have yet to be dealt with – and to submit for Cabinet approval the necessary resources to implement this plan.
