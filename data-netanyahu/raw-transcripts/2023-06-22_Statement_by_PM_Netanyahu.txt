Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today :

"We are always using the element of surprise. We are constantly changing the equation against the terrorists. We did so during the last operation in Gaza. We did so again in Jenin yesterday.

The cell that was eliminated, was eliminated by a UAV. This cell had carried out several terrorist attacks and was about to carry out another one but we closed accounts with it.

I would like to commend the IDF Intelligence Branch and the ISA for the precise intelligence, and the IDF for the precise operation. We will continue to act with initiative, innovation and surprise â€“ and we will triumph."
