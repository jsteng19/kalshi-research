PM Netanyahu released a Hebrew-language video in which he made the following remarks:

"The day before yesterday Ayatollah Khamenei, the ruler of Iran, declared his intention to destroy the State of Israel.

Yesterday he explained how he would do this â€“ with the unrestricted enrichment of uranium in order to produce an arsenal of nuclear bombs.

We are not surprised. We will not allow Iran to obtain nuclear weapons."
