Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has issued the following statement on US President Barack Obama's nomination of US Senator (D-Massachusetts) John Kerry to succeed Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State:

"I welcome the nomination of John Kerry to the post of US Secretary of State. Kerry has considerable experience and is a known supporter of the security of the State of Israel. John Kerry and I have been friends for many years. I very much appreciated the fact that six months ago, after my father passed away, he came to visit me during the week of mourning. I look forward to working together with him."
