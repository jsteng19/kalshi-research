Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, spoke with UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and asked him to publish photographs showing the munitions that were hidden in a UN school in Gaza and which were discovered yesterday. The Prime Minister added that Hamas conceals ammunition in schools and fires it at schools in Israel.

Prime Minister Netanyahu noted that there is no symmetry between a murderous terrorist organization and a moral and democratic state that is under attack by missiles and tunnels.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said that Israel regrets any inadvertent strike on Palestinian civilians, whereas Hamas intentionally fires at millions of Israeli civilians.
