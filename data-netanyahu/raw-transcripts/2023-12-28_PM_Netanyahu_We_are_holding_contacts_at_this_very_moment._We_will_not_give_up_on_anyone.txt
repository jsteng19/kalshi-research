Prime Minister Netanyahu at the start of the meeting:

"We are holding contacts at this very moment. I cannot detail the status. We are working to return them all. This is our goal."

The Prime Minister heard from the families about the situation of their loved ones and their questions in the context of existing information and what is being done in order to advance the release of all of the hostages.

Sara Netanyahu to the representatives of the families:

"As a mother and a child psychologist, I understand the impossible situation you are in, and the considerable support that you need, emotionally as well. We are all with you in order to help however we can.

I sent letters to the wives of 33 world leaders and I requested that they pressure the Red Cross, and an additional letter to the Pope. Hamas has committed crimes against humanity. We are all praying for the well-being of our hostages their quick and safe return home."

The representatives of 28 families of hostages attended the meeting, which was part of a series of meetings with family members.
