Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, addressed the Cybertech Conference in Tel Aviv. Following is an excerpt from his remarks:

"Iran [cyber]attacks Israel on a daily basis. We monitor these attacks. We see these attacks and we foil these attacks all the time.

Iran threatens us in many other ways. They have issued in the last 24 hours threats that say that they'll destroy us, they'll target our cities with missiles. We're not oblivious to these threats. They don't impress us because we know what our power is both in defense and in offense.

But the important thing is that any country can be attacked today with cyberattacks and every country needs the combination of a national cyber defense effort and a robust cyber security industry. And I think Israel has that and has that in ways that are in many ways unmatched."
