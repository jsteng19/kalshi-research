PM Netanyahu, at an ambassadors conference at the Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem, made the following remarks:

"This evening we welcome US Vice President Mike Pence, a great friend of Israel. He has landed here and we will welcome him with warmth and pride.

I will discuss two issues with him: Peace and security.

On peace, I have a message for Abu Mazen: There is no alternative for American leadership in the diplomatic process. Whoever is not ready to talk with the Americans about peace â€“ does not want peace.

On security, I have a message for the countries of Europe: I suggest that they take President Trump's words seriously.

If they want to preserve the nuclear agreement with Iran, they must propose amendments to the agreement that will prevent Iran from going nuclear, which threatens them and the entire world."
