"I very much appreciated the fact that President Obama reiterated his position that Iran must not be allowed to develop nuclear weapons and that all options are on the table. I also appreciated the fact that he made clear that when it comes to a nuclear armed Iran, containment is simply not an option, and equally in my judgment, perhaps most important of all, I appreciated the fact that he said that Israel must be able to defend itself, by itself, against any threat. I appreciate all his statements and I look forward to discussing them further with President Obama tomorrow."

Prime Minister Netanyahu added that he also spoke with President Shimon Peres and congratulated him on the fact that he is due to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom. The Prime Minister noted that this is a great honor for the State of Israel.
