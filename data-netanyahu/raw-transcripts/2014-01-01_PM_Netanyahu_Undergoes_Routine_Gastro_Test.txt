Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today at Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem, successfully underwent routine gastro examination, which is carried out once every several years. The examination was carried by Gastroenterology Department Head Prof. Eran Goldin. A small polyp was successfully removed from Prime Minister Netanyahu's large intestine. The examination was the last necessary for the Prime Minister's annual medical report.

Prime Minister Netanyahu's personal physician, Dr. Zvi Herman Berkowitz reports that the comprehensive lab tests – including cholesterol, fats and sugar tests – recently carried out on the Prime Minister show him to be completely healthy. His blood pressure was 120/80; he maintains a healthy lifestyle and proper diet. The Prime Minister works out several times a week and recently underwent a stress test that showed him to be in the top ten percentile for his age group.
