Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today:

"The intention of several European countries to recognize a Palestinian state is a reward for terrorism.

80% of the Palestinians in Judea and Samaria support the terrible massacre of October 7.

This evil cannot be given a state.

This would be a terrorist state. It will try to repeat the massacre of October 7 again and again; we will not consent to this.

Rewarding terrorism will not bring peace and neither will it stop us from defeating Hamas."
