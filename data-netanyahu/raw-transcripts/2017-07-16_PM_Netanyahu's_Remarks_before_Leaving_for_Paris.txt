Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made the following remarks before leaving for Paris and Budapest

"Before the onset of Shabbat [yesterday evening, Friday, 14 July 2017], I spoke with the parents of our two heroic policemen who were murdered on the Temple Mount. I sent them a hug from every citizen of Israel and participation in their awful grief. Also before Shabbat I directed that the mourners' tents of the families of the contemptible murderers be destroyed. This evening I held a discussion with the top security leadership and I instructed that metal detectors be placed at the entrance gates to the Temple Mount. We will also install security cameras on poles outside the Temple Mount but which give almost complete control over what goes on there. I decided that as of tomorrow, in the framework of our policy of maintaining the status-quo, we will gradually open the Temple Mount, but with increased security measures.

This evening I am leaving for Paris to meet with President Macron. Tomorrow we will participate in a very moving ceremony to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the deportation of Parisian Jews to the extermination camps. This was the first step in the broad extermination of French Jewry. I will then go on to Budapest to meet with Hungarian, Polish, Czech and Slovakian leaders. While we are strengthening ties with countries on five continents â€“ Asia, Africa, Australia, North America and South America, it is very important for us to also deepen relations with countries in Europe."
