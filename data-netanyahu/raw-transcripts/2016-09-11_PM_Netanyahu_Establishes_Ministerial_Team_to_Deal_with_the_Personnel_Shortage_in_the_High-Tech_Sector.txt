Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has decided to establish a ministerial team to deal with the personnel shortage in the high-tech sector. The Prime Minister will chair the team, which will also include Finance and Economy Minister Moshe Kahlon, Education Minister Naftali Bennett, Interior Minister Aryeh Deri, Aliyah and Immigrant Absorption Minister Sofa Landver, and Science, Technology and Space Minister Ofir Akunis. Jewish Agency Chairman Natan Sharansky will also be a member.

The team will operate on two planes: 1) Training workers, engineers and technicians in Israel and 2) Providing incentives for new immigrants to work in the high-tech sector.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"High-tech is a very important engine for growth and progress in the State of Israel. There are highly qualified people in Jewish communities around the world and we must do everything necessary to bring them to Israel."
