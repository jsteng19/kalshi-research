PM Netanyahu made the following remarks upon leaving on a historic visit to Brazil where he will meet with President-elect Jair Bolsonaro and attend the latter's inauguration:

"I am now leaving on a visit to Brazil at the invitation of its president. I will meet with President-elect Bolsonaro and with his ministers of defense, finance and foreign affairs. We will discuss Israel's ties with the largest country in Latin America, the fifth most populous country in the world. Brazil is a huge country with huge potential for the State of Israel, economically, diplomatically and vis-Ã -vis security. It is a great change that [President-elect] Bolsonaro has declared and I am pleased that we can begin a new era between Israel and the major power called Brazil."
