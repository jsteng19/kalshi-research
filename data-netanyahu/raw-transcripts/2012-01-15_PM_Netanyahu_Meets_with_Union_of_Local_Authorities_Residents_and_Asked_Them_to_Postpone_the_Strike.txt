Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this evening in his Jerusalem office, met with Union of Local Authorities leaders and asked them to postpone the strike in order not to overburden the population.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said that, "Now is not the time to upset the economy with a general strike. This would be a blow to the population over issues that it is possible to resolve within a short time. We are in the same boat and you do not have to pay the price for populist legislation. I oppose this irresponsible legislation. It is important that we continue to act in an economically responsible manner and not throw money around. If the economy collapses, in the end it will be the population that pays the price."

Prime Minister Netanyahu directed Prime Minister's Office Director-General Harel Locker to hold discussions with the Union of Local Authorities leaders in order to consider water subsidies to residents, the source of financing for property tax discounts, the issue of payments from the national lottery and all other issues raised by the leaders. It was agreed to establish a forum with the participation of the directors-general of PMO, the Finance Ministry and the Interior Ministry, and the Union of Local Authorities, in order to hold an ongoing dialogue on advancing issues pertinent to the local authorities' residents.
