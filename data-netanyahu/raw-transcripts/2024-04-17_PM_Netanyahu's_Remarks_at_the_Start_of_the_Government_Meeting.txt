Following are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks at the start of the Government meeting today:

"I have just come from meeting with the British and German foreign ministers. Last night, I spoke with British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, and soon I will speak with additional leaders.

I thank our friends for their support in defense of Israel and I say this – support in both words and deeds. They also have all kinds of suggestions and advice, which I appreciate; however, I would also like to clarify – we will make our decisions ourselves. The State of Israel will do whatever is necessary to defend itself.

Today, the Government will approve the Tekuma Plan to rebuild the communities in the Western Negev. We will invest the very large sum of NIS 19 billion in order to move the communities of the Western Negev forward for generations. We will invest in housing, infrastructure, education, employment, health and more.

The Hamas terrorists sought to uproot us. We will uproot them and deepen our roots. We will build the Land of Israel and safeguard our state."
