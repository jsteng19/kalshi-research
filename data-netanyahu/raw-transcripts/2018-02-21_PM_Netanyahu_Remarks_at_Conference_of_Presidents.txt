Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening, made the following remarks at the Inbal Hotel in Jerusalem, at the Conference of Major American Jewish Organizations Mission:

[Translated from the Hebrew]

"The Israeli intelligence services thwarted the downing of an Australian plane, an unimaginable slaughter. This would have caused a major disruption in global air transport and this is only one of dozens of terrorist attacks we have foiled around the world. I think that Israeli intelligence must be thanked for protecting not only Israelis but many civilians around the world."
