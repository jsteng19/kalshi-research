Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, participated in a session of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, chaired by MK Yuli Edelstein, during which he presented a diplomatic and security review. Prime Minister Netanyahu at the start of the session: "This is my first appearance before the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee under the current government. Israel's security policy and situation are the direct result of Israel's strength. The continuing policy of my governments is to cultivate this strength: The economic strength by enacting a free market policy, and technological and military strength by budgets and means that are the fruit of the economic policy. The combination of both develops diplomatic strength via regional alliances and with many other countries including major powers. Of course, this is being challenged by the rise of the new power in the region, which has completely replaced the Arab world in hostility to Israel and aspires to our destruction, and this is Iran. Over 90% of our security problems stem from Iran and its proxies, and our policy is aimed at increasing the circle of peace, to stop Iran and its proxies. Our position is clear: No agreement with Iran will be binding on Israel, which will continue to do everything to defend itself. Our opposition to a return to the original agreement, I think it is working, but there are still differences of outlook and we do not hide them, also about smaller agreements. We enunciate our policy clearly both openly and in closed rooms. With one hand we are working to stop Iran and with the other we are working energetically to expand the circle of peace. These pose major challenges and great opportunities for us."
