Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will, upon the start of the Knesset winter session, act to amend the national service law so that it will no longer be possible to do national service with the B'Tselem organization; the Prime Minister discussed the issue with coalition chairman MK David Bitan.

Prime Minister Netanyahu has previously contacted the Attorney General on the matter; the latter said that the law needs to be amended and thus the Prime Minister intends to do.
