Following are Prime Minister Netanyahu's remarks, at the Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem, at the event to present the national "Shield of Israel" plan to defeat the coronavirus, by national coronavirus project manager Prof. Ronni Gamzu:

"Citizens of Israel, you know that we are taking action on several fronts: On the security front, your eyes can see; on the economic front â€“ many actions: The extension of unemployment compensation, the unpaid leave, the assistance to businesses and the self-employed, the grant to citizens of Israel and more plans on the way. However, everything starts on the health front. The health front is designed to safeguard your health and your lives.

Last week, we appointed, together, Prof. Ronni Gamzu as the national coronavirus project manager. Prof. Gamzu will present a plan today. If one had to summarize in one word what is inherent in, and what stands at the foundation of, this plan, the word is 'together.'

We are working together and we are backing him together. It is no coincidence that Benny Gantz is here. He will speak right after me and Health Minister Yuli Edelstein will speak after him. I expect all Cabinet ministers to back this plan. I expect the citizens of Israel, all of them, without exception, to cooperate with it. Together we will defeat the coronavirus."
