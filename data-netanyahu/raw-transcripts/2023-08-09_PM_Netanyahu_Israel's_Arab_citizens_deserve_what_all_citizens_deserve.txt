The funds for the Arab local authorities in Israel will be transferred pursuant to an evaluation and supervision that they will be used for their designated purpose – for Israel's Arab citizens and nothing else.

It is the policy of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to facilitate the development and social welfare of all Israeli citizens, Arab and Jewish alike. Proof to this effect is that the Netanyahu governments have invested more in Israel's Arab citizens than all other governments combined.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"Israel's Arab citizens deserve what all citizens deserve and I am committed to this. This is what I demand of all government ministries and it will be carried out following an evaluation to ensure that the funds are indeed transferred for their designated purpose – for Israel's Arab citizens."
