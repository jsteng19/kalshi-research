Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, expressed his sorrow on the passing of actress Hanna Maron : "Hanna Maron was among Israel's leading artists, a pioneer of the Hebrew theatre and a great actress. She played countless leading roles on our stages even before the state was founded and after she was wounded in a terrorist attack, thereby proving that the show must go on. Her appearances were unforgettable. Even though it has been decades since she appeared in the series Krovim, krovim her best lines are still with us. Her passing is a loss to generations of Israelis who appreciated her talents. I send condolences to her family. May her memory be blessed."
