Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Galant and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, yesterday afternoon, agreed that the transfer of security responsibility for communities in areas adjacent to Jerusalem from the IDF to the police will be postponed by 30 days so that the police may evaluate its deployment. The transfer of responsibility was due to take place tomorrow, but in light of an assessment of the situation by Israel Police Inspector General Koby Shabtai and Border Police Commander Amir Cohen, according to which the resources necessary for the assumption of responsibility have yet to be transferred from the Defense Ministry, the National Security Minister asked to delay the transfer pending an evaluation of the matter; together with the Prime Minister and the Defense Minister, it was agreed to postpone the transfer by one month.
