Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, commented on the agreement to export Israeli gas to Egypt:

"I welcome the historic agreement that was announced on the export of Israeli gas to Egypt. This will put billions into the state treasury to benefit the education, health and social welfare of Israel's citizens.

Many people did not believe in the gas outline. We led it knowing that it would strengthen our security, economy and regional relations, but – above all – that it would strengthen Israel's citizens. This is a joyous day."
