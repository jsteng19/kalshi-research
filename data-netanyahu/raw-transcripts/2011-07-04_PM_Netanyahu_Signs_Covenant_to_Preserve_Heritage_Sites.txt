Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today signed the Covenant to Preserve Heritage Sites, a joint initiative of

the Society to Preserve Israel Heritage Sites

and the Knesset lobby on preserving heritage sites, in order to create commitment to the issue and foster ties between young people and Israel's heritage.

The Prime Minister's Office is a main arm in advancing the initiative to preserve heritage sites via the heritage plan. As of now, nine sites have been approved for preservation, at a cost of approximately NIS 32.5 million (NIS 12.5 million in Government financing and NIS 20 million from external sources) and a plan is currently being formulated for approximately 40 additional sites. Among the sites that have already been approved are

Hana Senesh House

in Sdot Yam,

President Yitzhak Ben Zvi's cabin in Jerusalem

the Metzudat Koach site

and others. These sites are among the over 150 initiatives included in the plan to rehabilitate and strengthen national heritage sites initiated by Prime Minister Netanyahu in order to preserve the Jewish People's heritage in its country.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said that preserving sites that have not been properly maintained is a national and international value and added that means were now available to preserve them. "The sites that have been preserved are attracting parents and children and are linking them to the Land, Jewish heritage and Zionism. The breakthrough in awareness is causing a great awakening on the ground; on Independence Day, 63 heritage sites were open without charge, which attracted approximately 100,000 visitors."
