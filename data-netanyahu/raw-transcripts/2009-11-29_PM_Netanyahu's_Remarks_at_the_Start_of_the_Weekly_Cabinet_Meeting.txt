Following are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks today at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting:

"Today we mark the 29th of November, on which the UN approved

General Assembly Resolution 181

to establish the Jewish State. The basis of a Jewish State is, first if all, a Jewish army, the IDF, and it is founded on the recruitment and volunteerism of our youth. This year there has been a welcome increase in the level of recruits, in number, including those going to combat units â€“ a 7% increase. All those who are eulogizing and have discounted the enlisting and fighting spirit of our youth are invited to visit the main induction center. I intend to do so in the near future. You will be convinced that there are youth who are full of motivation, full of power, full of ability that enlist and, when necessary, fight, and support fighters. There is a welcome change. We will hear a relevant briefing, and the ministers will be able to be directly inspired from the impressive data.

Tomorrow I, and a group of ministers, will depart on a one day visit to Germany. These visits were decided upon during the previous Government by the Chancellor Angela Merkel who proposed that the Israeli Government and the German Government meet each year. The previous visit was held here in Israel, the current visit will be in Berlin. We will discuss a number of issues, each minister in his own sphere.

During this visit two subjects stand atop our agenda. The first is diplomatic-security, which has important ramifications regarding Israel's defensive capabilities. Germany is a true partner in the great efforts to both advance peace and strengthen security. The second subject is renewable energy, replacing petroleum and protecting the environment.

I would also like, together with all ministers, to take this opportunity, in addition to what we have already published/once again, to greet our Muslim brothers on Eid al-adha.
