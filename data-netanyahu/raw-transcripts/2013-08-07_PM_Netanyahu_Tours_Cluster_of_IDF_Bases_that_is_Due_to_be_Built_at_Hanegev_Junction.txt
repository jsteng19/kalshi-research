Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, toured the cluster of IDF bases that is due to be built at Hanegev Junction ahead of the IDF's move to the south and referred to IDF activity on the northern border:

"There is something that the south and the north, and all areas, have in common â€“ IDF soldiers who protect us and our borders. Thus it was last night; we will continue to act responsibly in order to defend Israel's borders. On behalf of myself, the Defense Minister and all of you, I would like to send to the wounded best wishes for a quick recovery. We will continue to do our work in order to guard our country."
