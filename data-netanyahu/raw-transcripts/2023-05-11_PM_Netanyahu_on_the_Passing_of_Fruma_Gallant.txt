Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this morning: "On behalf of myself, my wife Sara and the members of the Likud [Knesset] faction, I send heartfelt condolences to our friend, Minister Yoav Gallant, on the passing of his mother Fruma. Fruma's inspirational story embodies the Zionist vision. She survived the horrors of the Holocaust, made the arduous journey to Israel on board the Exodus and established a splendid family; her son is the Defense Minister of the State of Israel. May her memory be blessed."
