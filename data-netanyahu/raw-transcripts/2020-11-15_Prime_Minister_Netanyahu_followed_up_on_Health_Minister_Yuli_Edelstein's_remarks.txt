"We are bound by confidential agreements and there are articles that cannot be published because this is the arrangement with them. We do not want to risk the supply of vaccines by opening these agreements.

However, I would like to say something else. To the extent that Pfizer supplies vaccines to the leading countries of the world, it will supply exactly the same thing to us. I have complete confidence that if it passes the US Food and Drug Administration, the various health ratification authorities and production, to the extent that it will be supplied to others, it will also be supplied to us. I have full confidence in this and I would not be concerned about it at all.

This is a very good agreement. By the way, the price of an option is around 1/1,000 of our general expenditures so far due to the coronavirus. This is a very good investment for your health and lives, citizens of Israel."
