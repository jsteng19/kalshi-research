Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening :

"I am in quarantine but am continuing to work for the vaccines, which are coming in their millions. Until we open up the economy, I want businesses to receive oxygen and, therefore, we are doing two things: First, the Finance Minister will bring a plan for additional grants for businesses and second, we hear from the Finance Ministry that they have lifted almost all of the restrictions on giving state-guaranteed loans to businesses. This is very major news. Together we are overcoming this, vis-Ã -vis both health and the economy."
