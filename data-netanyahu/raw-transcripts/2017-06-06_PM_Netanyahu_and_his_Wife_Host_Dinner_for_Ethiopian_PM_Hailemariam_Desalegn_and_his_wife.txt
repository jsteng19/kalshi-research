Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara, at the Prime Minister's Residence in Jerusalem, hosted dinner for Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn and his wife Roman Tesfaye.

Ester Rada sang "I Have No Other Country", written by Ehud Manor and set to music by Korin Elal, and the Amharic song "Nanu Ney."

Ethiopian Prime Minister Desalegn wrote in the guestbook: "I am so privileged to get this reception and close friendship. I am committed to deepen our people-to-people friendship and government to government. But above all my personal friendship with Prime Minister Netanyahu. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. [The] Ethiopia Israel relationship is very historic. Long live our relations and fraternal life. God bless Israel, God bless Ethiopia."

Roman Tesfaye wrote: "I am so thrilled to be received by the Israeli PM and First Lady. Thank you for hosting us. It shows our close relationship that will last forever. God bless Israel and Ethiopia. I feel at home!"
