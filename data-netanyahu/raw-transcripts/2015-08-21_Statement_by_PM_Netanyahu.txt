Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this afternoon, released the following statement:

"I said this week that we would hurt whoever tries to attack us, and this is what we have done. The IDF hit both the cell that carried out the firing and the Syrian forces that made it possible. We have no intention to escalate events but our policy remains as it was. The countries that are rushing to embrace Iran should know that it was an Iranian commander who directed and supported the cell that fired at Israel."
