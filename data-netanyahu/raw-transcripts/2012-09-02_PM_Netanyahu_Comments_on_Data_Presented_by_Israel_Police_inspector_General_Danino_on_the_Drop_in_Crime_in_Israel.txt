Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, at the weekly Cabinet meeting today, commented on the data presented by Israel Police Inspector General Yohanan Danino, according to which there has been a 5% drop in crime in Israel over the first eight months of 2012 in comparison to the same period last year; this includes a significant drop in crime in the Arab sector.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said: "This is a very welcome change. The willingness to enter Arab communities is revolutionary. I thank the policemen who are doing work that is tested by results, and there are results. The continued handling of this issue is important for benefit of the entire Israeli public, especially the Arab public. It is important that Israeli citizens know that we have a very good police force that is fighting crime effectively."

Public Security Minister Yitzhak Aharonovitch said, "The personal security of a citizen is very important. The police are dealing with racism, violence and disturbances of the public order, and are doing excellent work. I thank the Prime Minister for the support and the backing, and the Police Inspector General and his people for the good work."

Israel Police Inspector General Danino said, "Correct investment in the Israel Police is in the national interest. Police activity to enforce the law, fight crime and maintain the public peace contribute to the face of Israeli society and to a secure future."
