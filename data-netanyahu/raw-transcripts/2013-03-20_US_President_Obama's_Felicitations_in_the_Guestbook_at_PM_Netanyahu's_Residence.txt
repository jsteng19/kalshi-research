Following is the entry that US President Barack Obama wrote in the guestbook at President Shimon Peres' Residence:

"It is a great honour to reaffirm the extraordinary bonds between our two countries. By every measure, from security to our economy, our cooperation has never been greater and this in part is because of the strong commitment of Prime Minister Netanyahu. May our bonds continue to grow. On behalf of our people and prosperity for all people."
