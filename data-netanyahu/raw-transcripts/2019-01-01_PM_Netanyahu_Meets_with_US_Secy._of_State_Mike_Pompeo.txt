PM Netanyahu, in Brasilia, met with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and told him at the start of their meeting:

"I’m delighted to see Secretary of State Pompeo, our good friend Mike, the second time I think in about a month.

We have a lot to discuss. We’re going to discuss the intense cooperation between Israel and the United States, which will also deal with the questions following the decision, the American decisions on Syria, on how to intensify even further our intelligence and operations cooperation in Syria and elsewhere to block Iranian aggression in the Middle East. That’s a common aim.

I’m also very appreciative of the strong support that you and the president gave our efforts at self-defense against Syria just in the last few days. We’re going to have a lot to discuss."
