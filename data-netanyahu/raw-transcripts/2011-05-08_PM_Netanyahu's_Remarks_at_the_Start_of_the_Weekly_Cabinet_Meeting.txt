Following are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting today:

"This evening, the nation will mark

Remembrance Day for the fallen of Israel's Wars

. Almost 23,000 men and women have fallen in battle for the revival and security of the State of Israel. Approximately 2,500 additional Israelis have been murdered in terrorist actions. We and this state give thanks to them.

Those who fell in the unique Carmel wildfire disaster – including three heroic firefighters who gave their lives to save others – have recently joined the ranks of the fallen. Danny Chait, Uri Semandayev and youth volunteer Elad Riven, may their memories be blessed, stormed into the blaze like fighters defending the lives of others. In light of the special circumstances, the Cabinet decided in December of last year to grant a special status to their families and provide them with the rights of bereaved families.

We now face the question of commemoration. This is a sensitive and painful issue that requires serious, responsible and legal comment. I would like to commemorate the fallen in an appropriate manner that will honor their sacrifice. Since the issue of recognizing and commemorating the fallen is provided for by law, it requires legislation. Today, I will appoint a ministerial team chaired by Justice Minister Yaakov Neeman to submit – within 60 days – draft legislation, the goal of which will be to properly provide for the commemoration of the fallen.

On another important issue, today the Cabinet will make a socio-economic decision of the highest order. We will raise the minimum wage, with a NIS 410 supplement, to NIS 4,300 a month. This is immeasurably important news and will not only help low-income wage earners in dealing with price increases, but will also help reduce social gaps and encourage people to join the workforce."
