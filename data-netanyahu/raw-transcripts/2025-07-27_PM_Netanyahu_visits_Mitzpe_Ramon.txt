Prime Minister Netanyahu visits Mitzpe Ramon:

Prime Minister Netanyahu on a visit to Mitzpe Ramon: "This place is headed for a great leap forward — it's a world-class gem".

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited today the Mitzpe Ramon local council.

Prime Minister Netanyahu and the council head Elia Winter had a joint outlook of the Ramon Crater, after which they met with local residents. In addition, the Prime Minister held a working meeting with the council head and his team, discussing the ways to advance and develop the council and the entire area.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the residents :

"Hello everyone. First of all, I wish to thank you, Elia, and you, the residents of Mitzpe Ramon, for your warm and heartfelt hospitality. Warm is a given, but heartfelt, from the bottom of the heart, and I say that from the bottom of the heart of myself and my wife Sara.

I remember this place from more than 50 years ago, when I was a cadet at Bahad 1. I would run here from Bahad 1, get here and then return. We've been here several times. But now this place is headed for a great leap forward, and I'm here for a brief time to hear about how we can drive it forward even further.

I want to see this airfield doing civilian work, it will bring a lot of investments, many businesses that are arriving here anyway. But this place is a world-class gem — a gem of the nation of Israel and the Land of Israel, but a world-class gem".
