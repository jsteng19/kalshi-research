Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today (Friday, 10 April 2020), spoke by video conference with lone soldiers from around the country and told them that a great effort was being made so that after Passover and Maimouna it would be possible to gradually allow sections of the Israeli population to go out. Prime Minister Netanyahu thanked the soldiers for their dedicated service and wished them a happy holiday and good Sabbath. Prime Minister Netanyahu to the soldiers: "We very much appreciate your service and the fact that despite the coronavirus, you are watching over not only our restrictions but also our security. These challenges are not disappearing; they remain with us. You are being called upon to do two things: Guard the state and guard yourselves. I wish that you get through the holiday successfully, that you stay healthy and do well in every sense of the word." Prime Minister Netanyahu added: "I am not talking about your going out on leave because that is a decision for your commanders. But know that we are making a major effort so that after the holiday, after Passover and Maimouna, we will gradually begin, I hope, to allow sections of the Israeli population, residents of the state, to go out. This will be a gradual process that will take time. I am certain that throughout this process we will continue to rely on you. I offer you heartfelt thanks. Watch yourselves. Happy holiday." IDF soldiers from the Nahal, Golani and Jordan Valley brigades, the Armored Corps and the Air Force participated in the videoconference.
