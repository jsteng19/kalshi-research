Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: "There has been a very severe earthquake in Türkiye – which was also felt in other areas – in the past day. In accordance with the request of the Turkish government, I have directed the dispatch of search and rescue, and medical teams. This is what we do around the world and this is what we do in areas close to us. Since a request was also received to do this – for the many who were injured in the earthquake in Syria, I have instructed that this be done as well."
