Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening, issued the following statement:

"I express deep sorrow over the death of Saad Dawabsha. When I visited family members in hospital last week, I promised that we would use all the tools at our disposal to apprehend the murderers and deal with them to the fullest extent of the law and this is what we are doing. At last week's Security Cabinet meeting we made decisions to assist the fight against terrorism, including in regard to administrative detentions and advancing anti-terrorism legislation. We will not countenance terrorism of any kind."
