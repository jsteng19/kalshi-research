Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, at Mt. Herzl in Jerusalem, attended the state memorial ceremony for Zeev Jabotinsky. Following is an excerpt from his remarks: "We are constantly defending ourselves. Yesterday, a terrorist from Gaza tried to attack Israel and was eliminated by our forces. On your behalf, for the people of Israel, I send best wishes for a quick recovery to our wounded. We are also fighting on other fronts. On the northern front we are acting against Iran and Hezbollah and you are hearing about this these days as well. This is the iron wall."
