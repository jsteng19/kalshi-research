PM Netanyahu, from this morning, has been holding security consultations in the wake of events in Judea and Samaria.

Prime Minister Netanyahu also met, in Jerusalem, with international Middle East quartet envoy Tony Blair. After the meeting, the Prime Minister referred to the successful test of the Arrow-3 missile: "While Israel's hand is always extended in peace, we are always prepared for other possibilities as well. In this context, I welcome the successful test of the Arrow-3 missile; it expresses the high technological and security abilities of the State of Israel, the defense industries, the Defense Ministry and our cooperation with the US. This enables us, in any scenario of peace or of those who want to oppose peace, to contribute to the security of Israel's citizens."
