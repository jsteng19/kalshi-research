Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this afternoon, at the Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem, visited Yarden Noy, who was stabbed yesterday at the Pride Parade in Jerusalem, and told him, "Everyone has the right to live in peace in Israel and we will defend that right." The Prime Minister also told him that a comprehensive inquiry is being held as to how the man who perpetrated a similar crime ten years ago could have had access to the event.

Shaare Zedek Deputy Director Dr. Ofer Marin updated Prime Minister Netanyahu on Noy's progress and said that he is due to be released in the coming days.

Prime Minister Netanyahu, on behalf of the citizens of Israel, sent his wishes for a quick recovery to Noy and the young woman who was severely wounded and is hospitalized at Hadassah Ein Kerem.
