Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara express deep sorrow over the tragic passing of Herzl Shaul, father of IDF soldier the late Oron Shaul, whose body is in the hands of the Hamas terrorist organization.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"We received with great sorrow the news of the passing of Herzl Shaul, who suffered from a difficult disease and fought for his life over a prolonged period. In our meetings with Herzl, we saw a strong man who dedicated all of his time and energy to the struggles for his health and for the return of his late son Oron's remains. We grieve for his dedicated wife Zehava, who experienced a terrible tragedy over the loss of her son Oron and must now cope with the great pain of the loss of her beloved husband. We also convey our condolences to their sons Aviram and Ofek, who have experienced terrible loss twice in two years.

On behalf of the entire people of Israel, we share in the family's bereavement and assure that we will continue to act in all fields to bring Oron back for a Jewish burial. This effort will not cease until Oron returns home."
