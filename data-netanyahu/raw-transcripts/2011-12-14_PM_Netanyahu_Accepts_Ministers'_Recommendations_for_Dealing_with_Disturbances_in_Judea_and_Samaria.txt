Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today accepted the recommendations of Public Security Minister Yitzhak Aharonovitch and Justice Minister Yaakov Neeman for dealing with disturbances in Judea and Samaria. The ministers formulated the recommendations after meeting with ISA, IDF, Israel Police and State Attorney's Office teams.

The recommendations approved by Prime Minister Netanyahu are:

1. The immediate issuing of administrative detention orders against rioters;

2. Immediately increasing the number of those barred from various areas;

3. Trying rioters in military courts;

4. Giving IDF soldiers the authority to detain people; and

5. Increasing both the number of special ISA, Israel Police, IDF and State Attorney's Office investigation teams and the resources for investigations.

Prime Minister Netanyahu rejected, at this stage, the recommendation to define the rioters as terrorists.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said that, "Those who raise a hand against IDF soldiers or Israel Police personnel will be punished severely.

Those who rioted at the IDF Ephraim Brigade base

are like those who riot in Bilin. It is important to me to emphasize that this is a small group that does not represent the public that lives in Judea and Samaria, who are loyal to the state and its laws and who condemn the rioting."
