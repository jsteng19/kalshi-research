Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in New York, met with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu:

"It’s always a pleasure to see you. You’re a great friend of Israel. Australia and Israel have a solid friendship and I’m looking forward to coming to visit Australia. And I’m looking forward to seeing you in Israel soon."

Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull:

"Very good. Well Lucy [Turnbull] was there earlier this year. We’ve launched our first innovation centre there with you. Really, the start-up nation has been great inspiration to our whole innovation agenda. So our innovation launch pad is there and we will see a lot more collaboration between Australian and Israeli innovators and financiers. It’s a very important step. As you know, that’s the way you have to stay ahead in the 21st century – you have to innovate, to take on the challenges of technology and bring the imagination to bear on technology. That’s how you secure prosperity."

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"I agree. I think the future belongs to those who innovate. We both have innovative nations and we can do a lot more together than we can separately. And also, we owe you one for

the Australian troops and the liberation of our country from the Ottoman Empire. That was a great event. I think it was the last cavalry rush in history

Australian Prime Minister Turnbull:

"The last cavalry charge – that’s right,

in Be'er Sheba

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"You have to come and see it.

Australian Prime Minister Turnbull:

"I will. I’ll do that. I look forward to coming back."
