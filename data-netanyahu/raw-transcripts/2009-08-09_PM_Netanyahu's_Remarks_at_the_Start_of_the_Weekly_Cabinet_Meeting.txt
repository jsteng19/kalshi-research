Following are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting today:

"Today we will table a draft decision to extend continued action for those who were evacuated from Gush Katif and northern Samaria.

Tomorrow, I will tour the evacuees' communities. We must take greater action and soon in order to complete dealing with our brothers whose lives were destroyed and we, as the Government, Governments of Israel, promised to deal with them and rehabilitate the ruins of their lives. This means financial and social rehabilitation, rehabilitation in every sense of the word but now and not later.

We will determine all the procedures and I asked my friend, Minister Daniel Hershkowitz, who heads the ministerial team, to also submit recommendations and needs for implementation in order to end this tragedy. What was done cannot be undone. We can only conduct genuine introspection and say that the unilateral evacuation from the Gaza Strip brought neither peace nor security. To my regret, the opposite occurred and we know that Gaza became a Hamas base under Iranian control from which thousands of missiles have been fired, including in the last campaign. In short, this did not bring peace.

I think that we are committed to two things. First, the rehabilitation of our brothers, as I said. Second, we will not repeat this mistake. We want multi-lateral agreements based on two basic components: One, the genuine recognition of the State of Israel and two – of course – security arrangements, the honoring and enforcement of which will be assured. Regarding the unilateral evacuation from Gaza, these two elements were lacking. We will see to it that if there is a turn towards peace by the more moderate Palestinians, we will insist on the following components: Recognition and genuine demilitarization will find expression in, and be integral parts of, the peace arrangements."
