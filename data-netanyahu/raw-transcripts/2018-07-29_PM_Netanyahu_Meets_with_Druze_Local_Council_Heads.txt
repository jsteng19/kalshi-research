Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, along with ministers Yariv Levin and Ayoob Kara, met with Druze local council heads as part of the Prime Minister's ongoing talks with Druze community leaders.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"There are unending attempts to rescind the definition of the State of Israel as the national state of the Jewish people. We legislated the Nation-State Law in order to ensure that Israel will remain the national state of our people â€“ this is the purpose of the state's existence. The law does not detract at all from the individual rights of anybody. It is designed to make the necessary legal balance, the time for which has come, in order to ensure the character of the State of Israel.

You are describing genuine feelings and we must find a solution. I will continue [holding] consultations. We will establish a team led by staff head Yoav Horowitz and we will submit forthwith recommendations for actions that will strengthen the important ties between us."
