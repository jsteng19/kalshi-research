Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, made the following remarks upon landing in the US:

"The tango in the Middle East needs at least three. For years there have been two -- Israel and the US. Now it needs to be seen if the Palestinians are also present. In any case, in order for us to have an agreement, we must uphold our vital interests. I have proven that I do so, in the face of all pressures and all the turmoil, and I will continue to do so here as well."
