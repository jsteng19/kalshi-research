Following are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting today:

"We have recently witnessed

attacks on Islamic sites

, a Christian site and a Jewish site – a synagogue was attacked. We are not prepared to tolerate any vandalism, especially that directed against religious sensitivities. The State of Israel is both a tolerant state and a very intolerant state.

Our tolerance is toward religious sensitivities and our need to continue living together in coexistence and mutual respect, without violence, in tranquility and peace

. Our intolerance is directed toward those who oppose these practices and this way of life. We will act with all vigor to find them. I have instructed the security forces to bring those responsible to justice. We will act against them to the fullest extent of the law.

Today, we will continue our discussion of

the Trajtenberg report

. Approving the report will allow us to submit detailed decisions to the Cabinet in order to lower the cost of living. A combination of these steps will lower the prices of goods and marketing in the economy, will significantly lower parents' expenditures for education, will reduce customs duties, and will make housing more available.

My Government is committed to taking the necessary actions in order to ease living conditions for Israelis and to lower the cost of living – and I have no doubt that this will be the case. First the Cabinet, afterwards the Knesset."
