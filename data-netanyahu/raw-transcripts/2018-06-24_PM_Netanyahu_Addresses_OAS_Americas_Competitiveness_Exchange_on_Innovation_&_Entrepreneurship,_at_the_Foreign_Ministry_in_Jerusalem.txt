Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, at the Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem, addressed the OAS Americas Competitiveness Exchange on Innovation & Entrepreneurship. Following is an excerpt from his remarks:

"Welcome to Israel. Welcome to Jerusalem.

Everything is becoming technologized. Well, I hope not and I don’t believe that's quite true. I don’t think that technology will ever reproduce the haunting poetry of the Bible, of Shakespeare, of Cervantes. But it is entering everything.

I just heard of an algorithm, a program that defeated the best debater in Israel. Well, I'm not sure they tried the best debaters but it tells you about an undeniable truth that is that as technology seeps into every layer and the difference between hi-tech, middle-tech, low-tech is disappearing rapidly. Now some things may take more time but they're happening.

We used to say that agriculture is not technologized – let's talk about that. Everything is being technologized. Not the human spirit but everything is being technologized. Therefore, the future belongs to those who can innovate and create new technology. New technology creates its own demand."
