Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, held a discussion on the continued dealing with illegal migrants. Attending the discussion were Interior Minister Gideon Saar, Justice Minister Tzipi Livni, Public Security Minister Yitzhak Aharonovitch, Attorney General Yehuda Weinstein, Prime Minister's Office Director General Harel Locker, Prison Service Commissioner Aharon Franco, Tel Aviv District Police Commander Bentzy Sau, State Attorney Shai Nitzan, Migration and Population Authority Director Amnon Ben-Ami and other senior officials.

Prime Minister Netanyahu instructed that a new draft law be prepared that expresses the Government of Israel's determination to continue dealing with illegal migration, determination that has blocked illegal migration into Israel and led to the departure of approximately 6,000 illegal migrants up to now.

It was agreed that Interior Minister Saar will formulate forthwith a draft memorandum on the law that will provide for the continued detention of new migrants who will be held for an effective period, and for the continued operation of the Hulot open holding facility while taking into consideration the rulings of the High Court of Justice. At the same time action to encourage the voluntary repatriation of migrants will continue. Enforcement against the employment of illegal migrants will be stepped up and other measures will be taken.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said, "Preventing the entry of new migrants into Israel and encouraging the repatriation of migrants already in Israel is an outstanding national interest and thus we will act."

Interior Minister Saar said, "Our obligation to the citizens of Israel requires that we provide effective tools to enable the determined continuation of dealing with the phenomenon of illegal migration."

Attorney General Weinstein said, "We will continue to deal with the phenomenon of illegal migration while upholding the law and the rulings of the High Court of Justice."
