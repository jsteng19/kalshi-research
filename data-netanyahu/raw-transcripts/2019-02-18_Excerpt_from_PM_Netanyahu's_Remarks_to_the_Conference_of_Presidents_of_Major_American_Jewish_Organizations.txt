"With the Arab countries, as with many Muslim countries, the question is how to fight militant Islam. And recently in Warsaw, you saw something spectacular. I did. There were 60 foreign ministers, representatives of 60 countries in a hall about the size of this hall, with the representatives from half a dozen Arab countries who got on the stage and spoke about Iran.

They said Iran is the greatest danger we face. One was asked about Israel’s military action against Iran’s efforts to entrench itself in Syria and the answer was, 'Every country has a right to defend itself.'

They spoke about seeking solutions to problems in the Middle East. They said, yes, we want to solve the Israeli-Palestinian problem, but it cannot be solved unless we roll back Iran’s aggression. That’s a change."
