Prime Minister Netanyahu, commented as follows on the capture of terrorist Asem Barghouti who carried out the 13 December 2018 shooting at Givat Asaf and was involved in the 9 December 2018 shooting outside Ofra, and on the ISA:

"Several hours ago we captured the reprehensible murderer from Givat Asaf and Ofra. For this I commend the [Israel Police] special anti-terror unit, the IDF and especially the ISA, which is the best counter-terrorism organization of its kind in the world. We owe it much. It does its work with professionalism and dedication. There are no grounds for attacks on it."
