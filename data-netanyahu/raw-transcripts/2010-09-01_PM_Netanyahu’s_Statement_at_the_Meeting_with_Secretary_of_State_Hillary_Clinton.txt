Video by GPO I wish to make one thing clear: the blood of the settlers will not be ignored. We will find the murderers and punish those who sent them. I wish to clarify one other thing. Terror will not determine the fate of the settlements, the borders or anything else. These things will be determined only through negotiations. In these negotiations, we will also insist on the necessary security arrangements for the State of Israel in the face of this terror and other threats. These are the things I will also say during my discussions tomorrow with President Obama, with Secretary Clinton and with the leaders of Egypt, Jordan and the Palestinians.Like all the people of Israel, I am appalled at the despicable murder that took the lives of Talia and Yitzhak, Kochava and Avishai. I send my condolences to their families. Talia and Yitzhak left six children orphaned. Kochava left behind an eight-year-old daughter. Seven new orphans have been added to the circle of grief in Israel.
