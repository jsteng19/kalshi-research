Prime Minister Netanyahu spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron and clarified that Israel is acting according to international law. He emphasized that the formulas of the past have led to 53 years of failure and added that a return to them will lead to additional failure. Israel is prepared to hold peace negotiations on the basis of President Trump's plan, which has new ideas that enable genuine progress. It is the Palestinian refusal to conduct negotiations based on this plan and on the plans of the past that is preventing progress.

The two also discussed ways to deal with the coronavirus and agreed to hold a joint working group on the issue.
