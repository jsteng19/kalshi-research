Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this morning, made the following remarks: "Yesterday I held security consultations in wake of the firing at the Golan Heights in which I instructed the IDF to take strong action. We will not tolerate firing at our territory and will respond with great force to any aggression against us. This has been my consistent policy and this is what we will continue to do for the security of Israel."
