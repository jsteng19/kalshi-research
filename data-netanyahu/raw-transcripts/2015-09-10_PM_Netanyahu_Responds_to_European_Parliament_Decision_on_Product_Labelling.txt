Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this evening responded to the decision of the European Parliament on product labelling:

"This is unjust. It is simply a distortion of justice and of logic and I think that it also hurts peace; it does not advance peace. The root of the conflict is not the territories, and the root of the conflict is not the settlements. We have historical memory of what happened when Europe labelled Jewish products."
