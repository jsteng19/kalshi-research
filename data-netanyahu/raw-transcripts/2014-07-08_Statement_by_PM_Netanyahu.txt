Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening has issued the following statement:

"In recent days, Hamas terrorists have fired hundreds of rockets at Israel's civilians . No other country lives under such a threat, and no country would accept such a threat.

Israel will not tolerate the firing of rockets on our cities and towns .

We have therefore significantly expanded our operations against Hamas and the other terrorist organizations in Gaza .

This comes after our repeated efforts to restore calm were met with increased Hamas rocket fire.

Israel is not eager for war, but the security of our citizens is our primary consideration.

Israel targets Hamas terrorists and not innocent civilians. By contrast, Hamas targets Israeli civilians while hiding behind Palestinian civilians. Hamas, therefore, bears full responsibility for any harm that comes to Israeli and Palestinian civilians alike.

We are determined to give our citizens the safety and security they deserve."
