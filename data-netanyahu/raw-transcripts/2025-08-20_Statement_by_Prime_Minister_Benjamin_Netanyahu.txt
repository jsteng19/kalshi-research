Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today [translated from Hebrew]:

"I congratulate US Secretary of State Marco Rubio for deciding to impose sanctions on the judges of the International Court in The Hague.

This is a firm measure against the mendacious smear campaign against the State of Israel and the IDF, and for truth and justice."
