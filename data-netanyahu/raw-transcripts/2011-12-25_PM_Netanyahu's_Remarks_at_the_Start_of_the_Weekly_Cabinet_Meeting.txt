Following are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s remarks at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting today:

"Israel is a democratic, Western, liberal state. The public sphere is open and safe for everyone – men and women alike. There is no place for harassment or discrimination.

Last night, I spoke with Public Security Minister Yitzhak Aharonovitch who told me about the actions that have already been taken. I also spoke with Attorney General Yehuda Weinstein. The Israel Police are taking, and will take, action to arrest and stop those who spit, harass or raise a hand. I also ask government ministries and enforcement agencies to work to remove signs that call for separation on sidewalks. This has no place in a free and democratic state.

While we will use all legal means at our disposal, I would like to emphasize that this is not just a legal issue. It is also a social issue. It is also a question of public and social norms; therefore, I appeal to all public figures and spiritual leaders to act against this phenomenon. The public sphere in Israel will be open and safe for all."
