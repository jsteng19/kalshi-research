In his meeting today with senior American media figures, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu referred to the disagreements between Israel and the US over the past two days over the issue of planning and construction in Jerusalem, and said that this was a temporary matter. He emphasized that in his contacts with American administration officials, he is focusing on issues that will affect a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinian Authority in the long term.

Prime Minister Netanyahu told his interlocutors that in his talks tomorrow with US Secretary of State Hilary Clinton, he intends to discuss the need to formulate broad Israeli-American understandings regarding Israel's security needs under any peace agreement given the major security challenges that may be expected in the coming decade. In this context, the Prime Minister said that, "The chances of achieving a peace agreement will be significantly advanced by achieving comprehensive security understandings between Israel and the US."

Prime Minister Netanyahu added that he will also raise, with Secy. of State Clinton, the importance of extending the circle of peace to additional Arab countries that will establish peaceful relations with Israel alongside the formulation of an agreement with the Palestinians.
