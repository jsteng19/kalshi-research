Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expresses his deep sorrow over the passing of Minister Uri Orbach:

"I mourn the passing of Minister Uri Orbach, a writer, a journalist, a spiritual man and a Jewish patriot. Uri won over all who listened to him with his charm, knowledge and deep wisdom which stemmed from the depths of his soul. He had a deep sensitivity for every human being, a sensitivity that he brought with him as Senior Citizens Minister and to all his endeavors. Despite his exceptional qualities, there was no malice in him. I never met anyone who knew him and did not love him. Last night, alongside members of his family, I said goodbye to him at the hospital with a profound sense of grief and loss. Uri will be sorely missed by his dear family, his Cabinet colleagues and the State of Israel."
