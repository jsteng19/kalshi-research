Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today (Thursday, 4 May 2023), visited the ISA Special Operations Headquarters, from which this morning's counter-terrorist operation was overseen.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"This morning, the IDF, the ISA and the National Counter-Terrorism Unit took action in the Old City of Nablus, in daylight. They settled accounts with the murderers of Lucy, Maya and Rina Dee, may their memories be for a blessing. They confronted these murderers and eliminated them.

There is a message here that needs to be understood: In recent months, we have eliminated, or captured, 110 terrorists, most of them were eliminated. Our message to the murderers, to whoever attacks us, or tries to attack us is â€“ We will find you. You can hide, you can try to hide, but it will not help. The long arm of the State of Israel will find you."
