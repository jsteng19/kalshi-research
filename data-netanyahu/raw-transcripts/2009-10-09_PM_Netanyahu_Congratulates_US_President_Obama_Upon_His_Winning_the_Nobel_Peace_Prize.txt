Dear Mr. President,

Congratulations on winning the Nobel Prize for Peace. You have already inspired so many people around the world, and I know that this award also expresses the hope that your Presidency will usher in a new era of peace and reconciliation.

Nowhere is such a peace needed more than in the Middle East, a region that has been long marked by terror and bloodshed. I look forward to working closely with you in the years ahead to advance peace and to give hope to the peoples of our region who deserve to live in peace, security and dignity.

With respect,

Benjamin Netanyahu
