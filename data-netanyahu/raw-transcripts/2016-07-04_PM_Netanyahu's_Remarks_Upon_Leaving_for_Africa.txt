Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at Ben Gurion International Airport, made the following remarks prior to his departure on a visit to Africa:

"I am now leaving on an historic visit to Africa. This visit will begin with a summit meeting with leaders from seven African countries who are coming especially to Entebbe, Uganda for this meeting, to welcome a Prime Minister of Israel for the first time in decades on African soil.

Coming on a journey like this is also very important from diplomatic, economic and security perspectives and I am pleased that Israel is going back to Africa in a big way. We are opening Africa to Israel again. This visit will also include a moving meeting at Entebbe, where the great rescue operation was carried out. Also attending will be soldiers who participated in the operation as well as some of those who were rescued.

All Africa is excited by this visit and I am very excited as well."
