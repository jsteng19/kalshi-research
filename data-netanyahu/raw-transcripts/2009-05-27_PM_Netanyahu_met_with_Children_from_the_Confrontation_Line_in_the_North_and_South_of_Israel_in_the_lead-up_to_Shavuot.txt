Children from the confrontation line, from Metulla in the north, and from the Shafir Regional Council in the south, brought the traditional first fruits to the Prime Minister today, as part of the customary ascent to Jerusalem on the eve of Shavuot.

The Prime Minister thanked the children and wished all the citizens of Israel a happy Shavuot. He also expressed the hope that these first fruits will bring peace, tranquility and quiet on the security front.
