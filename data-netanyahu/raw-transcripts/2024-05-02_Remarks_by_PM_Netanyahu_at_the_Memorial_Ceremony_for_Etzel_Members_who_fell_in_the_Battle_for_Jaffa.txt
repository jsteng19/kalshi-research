Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, before the Security Cabinet meeting, at the memorial ceremony for Etzel (https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/background-and-overview-of-the-irgun-etzel) members who fell in the battle for Jaffa:

"There were differences of opinion among us about operations in near and distant arenas.

But at the end of the discussion, I made a decision and the decision was accepted.

We took action there and we also took action here.

We will do whatever is necessary to win and overcome our enemies, including in Rafah."
