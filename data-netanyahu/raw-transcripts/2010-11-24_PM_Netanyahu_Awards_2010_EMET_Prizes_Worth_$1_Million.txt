Prime Minister Netanyahu hailed the achievements of the winners: "I stand here moved and impressed by the achievements, the depth of the research, the original knowledge and the forward thinking in such varied fields. The State of Israel has received more Nobel Prizes in proportion to its population than any other country, and the contributions to science, the arts, and research, past and present, are vast. But just as the Jews contribute to humanity, this genius also contributes to maintaining our people and our country. We are in an age of knowledge and it is clear that a people that can produce such achievements rests on its human capital."
