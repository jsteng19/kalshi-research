Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today decided to appoint Maj.-Gen. (ret.) Yaakov Amidror as Chairman of the National Security Council. He will take office after an orderly transition in coordination with outgoing NSC Chairman Dr. Uzi Arad.

Maj.-Gen. (ret.) Amidror began his career in the IDF, in 1967, as a paratrooper. He later filled a series of posts including Director of the Intelligence Corps Research and Assessment Division, Military Secretary to the Defense Minister and Commander of the IDF Military Colleges.

After his discharge from the IDF, he continued to contribute to state security in a variety of roles including as a member of the Meridor Committee on formulating Israel's security doctrine and chairman of the team appointed by the Chief-of-Staff to inquire into intelligence operations during the Second Lebanon War. He has recently served as Vice President of the Lander Institute in Jerusalem.

Maj.-Gen. (ret.) Amidror has published two books in the field of intelligence and security and numerous articles in both professional journals and the press.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu noted that Maj.-Gen. (ret.) Amidror has not hesitated to express his professional opinions and said that he possesses vast military, strategic and security knowledge and experience. "He will continue to lead the NSC as a main element in determining the national security policy of the State of Israel," the Prime Minister said.

Maj.-Gen. (ret.) Amidror's appointment will be submitted for Cabinet approval pending an evaluation by the Appointments Committee chaired by the Civil Service Commissioner.
