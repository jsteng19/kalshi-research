Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this afternoon, toured the IDF training base complex in the Negev. Also participating in the tour were Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon, Negev and Galilee Development Minister Silvan Shalom, Prime Minister's Office Director General Harel Locker, Defense Ministry Director General Maj.-Gen. (ret.) Dan Harel, Negev and Galilee Development Ministry Director General Sigal Shealtiel and GOC Technology and Logistics Maj.-Gen. Kobi Barak. The training base complex headquarters is already active at the site ahead of the arrival of the first training base in approximately two months. In the coming year additional training bases – including schools for the Adjutancy, Education and Youth, Medical Corps, Logistics and Munitions corps – are due to be transferred to the complex.

The transfer of IDF units to the Negev is part of a wide-ranging national project to develop the Negev. The training base project is the first of three projects that will, in the end, bring approximately 30,000 soldiers and officers, including 6,000 career personnel, to the Negev. The complex sprawls over approximately 250,000 square meters of built-up area and will house approximately 12,000 people after all of the training bases will have been moved south.
