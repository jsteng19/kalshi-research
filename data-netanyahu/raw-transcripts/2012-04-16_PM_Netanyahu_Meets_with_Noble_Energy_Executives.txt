Prime Minister Netanyahu said that he sees a vital need in the rapid planning and construction of an additional natural gas terminal in Israel, which is essential for the energy security of the State of Israel and the stability of the major companies operating in the region.

The Noble Energy executives discussed the company's various projects in the region, including the "Tamar" field. They said that company would make every effort to meet – and perhaps even beat – the April 2013 target date for the start of gas production from "Tamar". They also informed the Prime Minister that over the course of the coming summer they will be able to supply an additional quantity of natural gas for the Israeli market in the framework of the development of the "Noa" field and the smaller fields around the "Yam Tethys" field.
