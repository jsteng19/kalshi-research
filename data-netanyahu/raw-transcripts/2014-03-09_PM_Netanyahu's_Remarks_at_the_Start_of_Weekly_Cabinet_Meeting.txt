Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this morning made the following remarks at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting:

"The Iranian weapons ship reached Israel last night. The operation to seize the ship had two goals: Preventing the delivery of deadly weapons to terrorist organizations in the Gaza Strip, which would have directly endangered Israel's citizens, and exposing the true face of Iran, which was behind this weapons shipment . Iran completely denies its involvement; it is lying in the most brazen manner. We will present evidence of this tomorrow and later.

I call this to the attention of Catherine Ashton, who is now visiting Tehran. I would like to ask her if she asked her Iranian hosts about this shipment of weapons for terrorist organizations, and if not, why not. Nobody has the right to ignore the true and murderous actions of the regime in Tehran. I think that it would be proper for the international community to refer to Iran's true policy, not its propaganda.

Today we are marking International Women's Day . We are proud that around this table are seven women director generals of government ministries. This is a record number. While there has certainly been a change in the trend here, we would like to see it continue to expand. I say this because I think that the gaps that still exist in employing women, as well as in women's salaries, are damaging in two ways: The first is a moral issue. There is no justification for this discrimination. Second is the socio-economic issue. We can certainly improve the Israeli economy by giving qualified and experienced women – and there are many – the chance to take up key positions in Israeli society and in the Israeli economy. I hope that what we are doing year round will advance this goal, which is good not only for Israeli women but for all Israelis."
