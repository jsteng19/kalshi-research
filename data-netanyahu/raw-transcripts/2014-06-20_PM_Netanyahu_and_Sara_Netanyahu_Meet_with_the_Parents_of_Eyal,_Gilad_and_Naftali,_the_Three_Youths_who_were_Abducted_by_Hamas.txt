Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara, today, at the Prime Minister's residence in Jerusalem, met with the parents of Eyal Yifrach, Gilad Shaar and Naftali Frankel, the three youths who were abducted last week by Hamas.

Prime Minister Netanyahu told the parents at the start of the meeting, "The nation gives you strength and you give it strength back."

Prime Minister Netanyahu stressed that locating the youths takes precedence over everything: "This is the principal goal of our operational and intelligence activity and all of the appropriate units are working on this objective. We have reinforced units in the field and we are making great efforts to reach the boys."

Sara Netanyahu told the parents at the start of the meeting that she was moved to meet them and emphasized their inner strength and strong faith. "I would like to continue to support you and embrace you along with the entire Jewish people, The entire nations awaits the return of your boys."
