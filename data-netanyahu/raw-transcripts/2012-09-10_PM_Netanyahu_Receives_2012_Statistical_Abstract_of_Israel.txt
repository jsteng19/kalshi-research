Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this morning received from Chief Statistician Prof. Shlomo Yitzhaki, the 2012 Statistical Abstract of Israel. The Prime Minister said: "In 2013, the number of Jewish citizens in the State of Israel will pass six million and the overall number of citizens will be over eight million. Life expectancy in Israel is among the highest in the world and that of Israeli men is second among OECD member states. We also have the highest positive net migration balance in 30 years, due – in part – to the return of Israelis. Israel is the home of the Jewish People and of every Israeli citizen. There have been impressive improvements here in relation to Western countries in recent years and we must work hard to continue this way."
