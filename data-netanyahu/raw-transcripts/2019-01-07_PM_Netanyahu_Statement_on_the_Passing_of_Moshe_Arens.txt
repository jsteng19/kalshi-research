Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, released the following statement:

"My wife Sara and I weep bitterly over the passing of someone we loved dearly, the late Moshe Arens.

Misha, my teacher and mentor, was an outstanding student of Zeev Jabotinsky. In this framework he knew my father, who was present at his wedding to his dear wife Muriel. Since then there has been an abiding bond between our families. I watched Misha do amazing things to build up the standing of the State of Israel time and again â€“ as ambassador in Washington, Foreign Minister, Chairman of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, and Defense Minister. In recent years he dedicated himself to endlessly watching over the documentation of the full story of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, in which Betar members had a central role.

Several weeks ago I visited Misha in his home He was lucid as always, sharp as a razor, marvelous in the splendor and nobility of his soul, an exemplar. There was no greater patriot. Moshe Arens' great contribution to our people and our state will be remembered forever.

Rest in peace Misha; you were very dear to me.

I loved you as a son loved his father."
