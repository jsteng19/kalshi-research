From remarks by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu:

"It seems that the rocket barrages are in response to our counter-terrorist operations yesterday. We will continue to hit all those who want to attack us and will act against them in great strength. Last year, the number of rockets fired from Gaza was the lowest in over a decade but this is not sufficient. We will continue to act in order to ensure the security of Israelis in the south and throughout the country."
