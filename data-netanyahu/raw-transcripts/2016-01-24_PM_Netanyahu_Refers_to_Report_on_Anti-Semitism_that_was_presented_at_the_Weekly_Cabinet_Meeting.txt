Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahucommented on the report on anti-Semitism that was presented at the weekly Cabinet meeting:

"This is a very important and significant report. Anti-Semitism still exists and is becoming ever more vicious. I call on the international community to take action against anti-Semitism and strongly condemn all displays of anti-Semitism. It cannot be that 70 years after the Holocaust anti-Semitism can still be seen in full force. In light of what happened in the past, it must be ensured that such a disaster does not recur and this is the responsibility of the EU and the UN, which are silent in face of these worrying data."

Prime Minister Netanyahu instructed all elements to step up information activity and education around the world against anti-Semitism.
