Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made the following remarks at the start of the Cabinet meeting:

"This morning I met with Histadrut [labor federation] Chairman Avi Nissenkorn and Manufacturers Association of Israel President Zvi Oren. I informed them that I have instructed the Finance Ministry to enable the raising of the minimum wage in the government sector to NIS 5,000. This is in continuation of our raising the minimum wage from NIS 3,800 to NIS 4,300, which we did in 2011, and now we are raising it from NIS 4,300 a month to NIS 5,000 a month."
