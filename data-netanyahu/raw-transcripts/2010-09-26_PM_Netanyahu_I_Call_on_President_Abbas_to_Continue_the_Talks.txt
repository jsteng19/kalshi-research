Prime Minister Netanyahu added: "I hope that President Abbas will stay in the talks and, with me, continue on the road towards peace, which we started only three weeks ago after many in the world realized that my intentions to achieve peace are serious and genuine, and that I honor my commitments. During my Government's term in office, Israel has gone a significant way towards helping the Palestinians by easing restrictions, which has advanced their quality of life, both in Judea and Samaria, and in the Gaza Strip. I say to President Abbas: For the future of both our peoples, let us focus on what is really important. Let us proceed in accelerated, sincere and continuous talks in order to bring about an historic peace framework agreement within one year." Prime Minister Netanyahu expressed his great appreciation for US President Barack Obama's, Secy. of State Clinton's, and [former] Senator George Mitchell's major efforts towards resuming the peace talks and ensuring their continuation.
