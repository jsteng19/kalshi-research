Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara, this afternoon, left on an official visit to the UN General Assembly in New York.

Prior to boarding the plane, the Prime Minister said:

"I am now leaving for the US where I will address the UN General Assembly. Each time that I address the UN I feel the privilege and great honor of telling the truth before the world on behalf of the citizens of Israel, on behalf of our country. The world needs to know what the citizens of Israel feel about the nuclear agreement with Iran and what we expect from the international community in the wake of this agreement.

In my speech, I will – of course – refer to our policy vis-à-vis Syria and the dangers on our northern border. The following day I will meet with US Secretary of State John Kerry and will discuss with him the strengthening of Israel's security. We will also discuss the peace process.

Israel desires peace with the Palestinians who, to my regret, are continuing to spread gross lies about our policy on the Temple Mount. I will demand a halt to this wild incitement. Israel is committed to the status quo; Israel is maintaining the status quo. It is the Palestinian rioters who are bringing war materiel, pipebombs and fireworks onto the Temple Mount who are harming the sanctity of the place and it is they who are violating the status quo.

Indeed, with every passing day it is clear that within the collapsing Middle East Islamic extremists are capturing more and more territory. Israel is an island of progress and stability. I will say all of this and more at the UN General Assembly and in my meetings in the US."
