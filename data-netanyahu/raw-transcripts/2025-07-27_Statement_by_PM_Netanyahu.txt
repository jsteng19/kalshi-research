Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu:

Together with the entire people of Israel, we mourn our heroic fighters who fell in battle in Gaza: Captain Amir Saad and Sergeant Inon Nuriel Vana, of blessed memory, fighters of the Golani Brigade; and Master Sergeant (Res.) Betzalel Yehoshua Mosbacher, of blessed memory, who succumbed to his wounds after being injured in battle.

My wife and I send our condolences to the dear families, and in the name of the entire nation, embrace them in the time of their heavy grief. We also pray for the swift recovery of the injured.

Our brave fighters have sacrificed their lives in the battle to defeat the murderers of Hamas, and for the sacred goal of releasing our hostages. We will not relent from these goals until victory is achieved.

May their memory be a blessing, and may G-d avenge their blood.
