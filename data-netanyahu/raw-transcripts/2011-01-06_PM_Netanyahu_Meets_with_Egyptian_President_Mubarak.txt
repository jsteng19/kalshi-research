Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met today (Thursday), 6.1.11, in Sharm e-Sheikh, with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. The two leaders held a lengthy, friendly and comprehensive discussion that focused on the bilateral effort to advance the diplomatic process.

Prime Minister Netanyahu reiterated that he believes that a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians is possible provided that the latter are willing to end the conflict. He asked President Mubarak to act to persuade the Palestinians to move to direct, intensive and serious negotiations – in which all core issues will be raised – forthwith.

Prime Minister Netanyahu updated President Mubarak on the rapid progress in constructing the fence along the border with Egypt and added that the fence would help reduce the number of Africans who infiltrate into Israel through Egypt, some of whom remain there.

After the meeting, an expanded lunch was held with the participation of Industry, Trade and Labor Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, National Security Adviser Dr. Uzi Arad and the Prime Minister's Military Secretary, Maj.-Gen. Yohanan Loaker. Attending from the Egyptian side were Foreign Minister Ahmed Abul Gheit, President Mubarak's Chief-of-Staff, Dr. Zakaria Azmi, President Mubarak's Adviser, Ambassador Soliman Awad and South Sinai Gov. Muhammad Shousha.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said that Israel is committed to aggressively fighting terrorist elements in Gaza that endanger its security and peace.
