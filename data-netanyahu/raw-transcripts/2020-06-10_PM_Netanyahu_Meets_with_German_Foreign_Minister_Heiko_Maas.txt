Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem, met with German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas. Prime Minister Netanyahu acceded to German Foreign Minister Maas's request for a meeting. The two discussed dealing with the coronavirus and its implications for the economy. The Prime Minister insisted on the need to increase the pressure on Iran and emphasized that the International Atomic Energy Agency had determined that Iran is continuing to violate its commitments and conceal sites suspected of military nuclear activity. Prime Minister Netanyahu and German Foreign Minister Maas also discussed halting financing for NGOs that are active against Israel. German Foreign Minister Maas asked to hear about the Israeli government's plans regarding the Trump Plan, especially due to Germany's upcoming European Union presidency and its status as a member of the UN Security Council. Prime Minister Netanyahu insisted that Israel's vital interests – such as the need for complete security control west of the Jordan River – be upheld in future agreement. The Prime Minister also said that any realistic plan must recognize the reality of Israeli settlement on the ground and not foster the illusion of uprooting people from their homes.
