Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today commented on the High Court of Justice decision regarding illegal migrants:

"I am determined to continue to lead the Government's actions in dealing with the phenomenon of illegal migration.

At a time when many countries in the world are dealing with the phenomenon of illegal migration, we have blocked it and last month not even a single illegal migrant crossed our southern border. This result was achieved thanks to the variety of measures we have enacted including the construction of a fence on the southern border.

Alongside honoring the decision of the High Court of Justice, I, in cooperation with the Interior Minister and the Attorney General, intend to find ways that are in keeping with the decision and which will allow the implementation of our determined policy which has blocked illegal migration and has already repatriated thousands of illegal migrants."
