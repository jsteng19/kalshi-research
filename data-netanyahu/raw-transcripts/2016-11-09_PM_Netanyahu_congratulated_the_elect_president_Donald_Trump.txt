President-elect Trump, my friend,

Congratulations on being elected President of the United States of America.

You are a great friend of Israel.

Over the years, you’ve expressed your support consistently, and I deeply appreciate it.

I look forward to working with you to advance security, prosperity and peace.

Israel is grateful for the broad support it enjoys among the American people, and I’m confident that the two of us, working closely together, will bring the great alliance between our two countries to even greater heights.

May God bless America.

May God bless Israel.

May God bless our enduring alliance.
