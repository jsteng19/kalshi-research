Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with participants in this year's International Bible Contest (to be held on Independence Day, Thursday, 23 April) and told them:

"The Tanakh is the foundation of our lives. We would not exist without it. It reflects our identity and our values, which grew in this Land. It also reflects the great hopes of our people to return to our homeland and build our homes there. None of this would occur without the Tanakh. Therefore, it is good to pore over this book day and night. The Tanakh is like an ever flowing spring and I wish you all success."

This year's contestants include representatives from the US, Canada, Mexico, Panama, Turkey, South Africa, Brazil and other countries.
