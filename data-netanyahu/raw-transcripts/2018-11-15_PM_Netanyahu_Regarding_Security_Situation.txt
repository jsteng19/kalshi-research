Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"This morning I heard an outrageous remark, and even following an apology, I have to put things straight.

Sderot is just like Tel Aviv. The security of the residents of the south is just as important as the security of the rest of Israel. We are in the middle of a campaign. Patience, cool and determination are necessary. We are preparing for what comes next. "
