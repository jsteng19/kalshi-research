Following is an excerpt from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s remarks, this morning, at the “Corona Crisis Local Leadership Conference”: “I am constantly dealing – apart from security – with two major tasks: First, maintaining health and life, and second, opening up the economy, providing incentives for the economy and getting the economy moving. However, for this the government needs to be stabilized so that it can operate efficiently. Therefore, when our friend MK Hauser contacted me yesterday on behalf of the Derech Eretz faction and said ‘Come, give another opportunity to try and stabilize the political system so that we will have a government that can continue to take action in the fight against corona’ – I said that I was willing. We need to make every effort to avoid elections, stabilize the government and fight the coronavirus from a health standpoint, and fight to open up the economy. This is what we are doing. I also hope that we are doing this successfully. I know that you are major partners in this. You have a very important role in this fight. The most important thing that you can do is to instill the coronavirus rules in your residents: Wear masks, maintain distance and avoid gatherings. There is no alternative for your leadership and your enforcement, especially regarding businesses, so that we will be able to defeat this disease together.”
