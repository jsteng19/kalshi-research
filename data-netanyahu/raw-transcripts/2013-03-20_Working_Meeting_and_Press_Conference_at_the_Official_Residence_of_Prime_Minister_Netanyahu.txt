Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara will greet US President Barack Obama at the entrance of the former’s official residence. At the start of the working meeting between Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Obama, the Prime Minister will give the President a gift: A gold-plated 0.04 millimeter nano-chip stamped – to a depth of 0.00002 mm – with the declarations of independence of Israel and the US side-by-side. The nano-chip was placed on a Jerusalem stone from the late Second Temple period (from the first century BCE until the first century CE) that served as a seal for clay jars that held liquids and spices. The gift was developed at the Russell Berrie Nanotechnology Institute at the Technion. The unique gift symbolizes the main messages of the visit – the strong and deep state of bilateral ties, the link of thousands of years between the People of Israel and the Land of Israel, and the leading technological status of Israel’s research and development centers.
