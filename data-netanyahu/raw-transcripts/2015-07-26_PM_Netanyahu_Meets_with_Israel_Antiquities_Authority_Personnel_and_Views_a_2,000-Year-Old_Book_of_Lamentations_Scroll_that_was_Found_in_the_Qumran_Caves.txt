Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in his Jerusalem office, met with Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) personnel who showed him a 2,000-year-old Book of Lamentations scroll that was found in the Qumran caves, that was recently put on display for the first time at the Bible Lands museum in Jerusalem.

IAA Curator in Charge of the Dead Sea Scrolls Pnina Shor updated Prime Minister Netanyahu on the scroll, which has been dated to between 30 BCE and 70 CE. She said that the scroll is the earliest known example of the Book of Lamentations and added that due to its importance the scroll is stored at an IAA laboratory.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said, "This is an important and moving find. It is very significant that that this scroll has been brought to the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem, our united capital, on the Fast of the Ninth [of the Hebrew month] of Av."
