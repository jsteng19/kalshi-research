Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon have not approved new construction as has been published.

Almost all of the permits are for upgrading existing structures. The small proportion of them pertaining to new construction are for the community of Ganei Modi'in, which abuts the fence and which will be part of Israel in any future agreement.
