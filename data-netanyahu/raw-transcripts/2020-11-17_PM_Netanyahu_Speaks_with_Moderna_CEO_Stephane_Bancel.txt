Prime Minister Netanyahu, today:

"Yesterday I spoke with Moderna Chief Executive Officer Stephane Bancel. Moderna has successfully passed the trial of the vaccine, with a very high mark â€“ 94.5% success. We signed an agreement with them for supply of a certain quantity. We are conducting negotiations with them about an additional quantity and I hope that in the wake of the conversation we will be able to complete these negotiations quickly. I must tell you that the CEO was very friendly. My policy is to bring as many vaccines as possible, from as many sources as possible, for as many citizens as possible, in as little time as possible."
