The Cabinet, today, at a festive meeting in Sderot, approved a decision to strengthen civil resilience and develop Sderot and the communities in the area around the Gaza Strip, for 2023-2024.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"The area around the Gaza Strip is Israel. All sectors of our nation live here: Religious, secular and traditional, new and veteran immigrants, east and west â€“ everyone. We will continue to develop the area around the communities in the area, in Israel, for the benefit of the residents and for the benefit of the entire State of Israel."

The NIS 1.7 billion decision includes significant investment in the following areas:

1. Approximately NIS 830 million will be invested in developing infrastructure and upgrading public areas.

2. Approximately NIS 190 million will be invested in developing local and regional growth engines.

3. Approximately NIS 220 million will be invested in developing and strengthening the local economy.

4. Approximately NIS 70 million will be invested in emergency readiness.

5. Approximately NIS 100 million will be invested in strengthening personal and community resilience and security.

The Cabinet decisions on the area around the Gaza Strip have proven themselves; demographic growth in the area is significantly higher relative to growth in the rest of the country. The decision reflects the great importance that the government ascribes to developing the area around the Gaza Strip.

The government will continue to strengthen residents of the area and the local and the local councils; all government ministries will give national preference to the matter.
