Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu commented on the attack in Yemen following the ceremony of the laying of the cornerstone for the promenade named after US President Trump in Bat Yam: "We will continue to strike. Whoever attacks us – we will reach them"

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu:

"Several days ago we eliminated most of the members of the terrorist Houthi government. In response, the Houthis fired two days ago at the Ramon Airport.

This did not weaken our resolve – we struck them again today from the air, their terror facilities, their terror bases with a great number of terrorists, and other facilities as well.

We will continue to strike. Whoever strikes us, whoever attacks us – we will reach them".
