Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today:

"I held an additional meeting today with President Trump in the White House, and afterwards, a brief meeting with Vice President Vance.

We focused on the efforts to release our hostages. We are not relenting, even for a moment, and this is made possible due to the military pressure by our heroic soldiers.

Unfortunately, this effort has exacted a painful price from us, the loss of the best of our sons.

But we are determined to achieve all of our objectives: The release of all of our hostages â€“ the living and the deceased, and the elimination of Hamas's military and governing capabilities, thereby ensuring that Gaza will never again constitute a threat to Israel.

We also discussed the implications and possibilities of the great victory that we achieved over Iran.

Opportunities have been opened here for expanding the circle of peace, for expanding the Abraham Accords. We are working on this with full vigor.

I also conveyed to President Trump your appreciation, citizens of Israel, for supporting us, for the determined action he took and for the joint effort that we are making today to bring a great future to the Middle East and to the State of Israel."
