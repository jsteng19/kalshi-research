Following are Prime Minister Netanyahu's remarks after the Corona Cabinet meeting:

"Yesterday we heard from World Health Organization officials about the new coronavirus mutation and we also heard British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's statement about the spread of the mutated virus in his country.

Last night I immediately convened a ministerial team to discuss this and I convened the Corona Cabinet today in order to make important decisions. According to the information in our hands, this mutation is spreading much faster than the regular virus but it is not deadlier; neither do we have any indication that the vaccine we have will not overcome it. This is the information that we have at the moment. Of course, we are monitoring the situation.

At a time when we are embarking on a huge vaccine campaign today, we also have another challenge that we must deal with: We are doing everything to prevent the mutation from entering Israel. Today we made a tough decision but one that is dictated by reality. We closed the skies to all flights to Israel from Britain, Denmark and South Africa. The mutation is present in these countries. We will add other countries should it prove necessary.

Whoever returns from these countries will enter quarantine and it is very important that they be tested. It is precisely now, when we have the vaccine and we see the light at the end of the tunnel, that we must continue to follow the rules. We will continue to make the correct decisions for your health and for our country."
