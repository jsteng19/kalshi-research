Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ordered the reinforcement of Israel Police units in Jerusalem; to this end, three reserve Border Police companies have been mobilized. The mobilization of forces will continue as necessary. The three companies will reinforce the Israel Police in Jerusalem and throughout the country. An increased presence is a primary preventive and deterrent measure.

Prime Minister Netanyahu will, tomorrow, convene an additional discussion of the Muslim Brotherhood and the Islamic Movement. The security establishment has – in recent days, on instruction from the Prime Minister – formulated a series of actions against the Islamic Movement and the incitement that it is fomenting.

Prime Minister Netanyahu, last night, spoke with US Secretary of State John Kerry and made it clear that he expects the Palestinian Authority to stop its wild and mendacious incitement, which is causing the current wave of terrorism. Secy. of State Kerry clarified that the US is aware of the fact that it is Israel's policy to maintain the status quo and not change it.
