Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, met with Belgian Foreign Minister Didier Reynders. Belgium is one of the 17 countries that use civilian nuclear power without any centrifuges and without a heavy water reactor. At the start of their meeting, Prime Minister Netanyahu said, "Our common goal, that of the US, Europe China and Russia is to prevent Iran from developing a military nuclear capability. I think it's time to improve the deal. Iran is on its knees economically and it's possible to get a better deal. Before the sanctions are lessened, get a good deal, not a bad deal."
