This is a momentary response; when the dust clears, it will be clear that the Israeli economy is very strong.

The security industries are bursting with orders. The gas industry is increasing exports to Europe and seven companies are now competing for tenders to explore for gas in Israel at an investment worth billions. Intel is planning its largest investment outside of the US ever and will invest $25 billion in Israel. NVIDIA is building a supercomputer in Israel and we are moving forward in AI, cyber and the manufacture of chips in Israel. Growth is increasing and inflation has been blocked. Regulation is being lifted and free market competition is increasing.

The Israeli economy is based on strong fundamentals and will continue to grow under experienced leadership that is enacting a responsible economic policy.
