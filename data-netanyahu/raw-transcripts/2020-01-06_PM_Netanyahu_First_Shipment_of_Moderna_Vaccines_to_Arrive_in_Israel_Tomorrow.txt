Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening:

"I spoke several days ago with Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel and the first shipment of Moderna vaccines is due to arrive in Israel tomorrow. We will give these vaccines to people who cannot go to their HMO, whether they are isolated at home or cannot go to the inoculation sites for any other reason.

This is the first Moderna shipment, others will come. I am working to bring millions of additional vaccines to the citizens of Israel so that we can emerge from the coronavirus pandemic once and for all."
