Prime Minister Netanyahu and Cindy McCain, Executive Director of the World Food Programme, met in Jerusalem. They had a constructive meeting concerning the ongoing and continued provision of humanitarian aid to Gazan civilians.

They discussed the importance of protecting civilians from hunger and malnutrition and ensuring that their basic essential needs are met. They noted the increase in humanitarian aid into Gaza over the last month and agreed to redouble efforts to expedite and sustain the entry of humanitarian goods into Gaza given the dire needs on the ground.

It was agreed that every effort must be made to ensure that humanitarian aid reaches the most vulnerable people where they are, and that humanitarian aid is provided exclusively to civilians.
