Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu upon arriving in London, made the following remarks

"Khamenei is not giving supporters of the agreement any room for illusion. He has made it clear that the US is the Great Satan and that Iran intends to destroy the State of Israel.

This will not happen. Israel is a strong country and it will become even stronger. However, the conclusion that arises from the remarks of the tyrant in Tehran is that all responsible countries must cooperate in order to stop Iran's terrorism and aggression which, to my regret, will only increase as a result of the agreement."
