Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening to representatives of the hostages' families, at the Kirya in Tel Aviv [translated from Hebrew]:

"The effort is continuing. The contacts are being held; they have not been cut off.

There was an ultimatum from Hamas; now it has been softened.

These contacts are being held now."
