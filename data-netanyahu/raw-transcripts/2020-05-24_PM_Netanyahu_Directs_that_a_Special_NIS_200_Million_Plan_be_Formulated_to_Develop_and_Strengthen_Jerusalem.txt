At the festive Cabinet meeting, in honor of Jerusalem Day, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu instructed that a special NIS 200 million plan be prepared for the strengthening and development of Jerusalem. Prime Minister Netanyahu at the start of the Cabinet meeting: “I ask the director generals of the Prime Minister’s Office and the Heritage Ministry, together with Finance Minister Yisrael Katz, to prepare a special NIS 200 million plan to continue developing and strengthening Jerusalem. This is also important in the corona era. This is important because Jerusalem is always our greatest joy. I can conclude and say: Next year in the rebuilt and healthy Jerusalem.” Jerusalem and Heritage Minister Rabbi Rafi Peretz: “The challenge of restoration after the corona crisis is a great challenge. The city of Jerusalem was specially hit because tourism is a key component of the city’s economy. Over 80% of tourists who come to Israel visit Jerusalem. We will construct an in-depth and thorough plan to strengthen and improve our capital Jerusalem.”
