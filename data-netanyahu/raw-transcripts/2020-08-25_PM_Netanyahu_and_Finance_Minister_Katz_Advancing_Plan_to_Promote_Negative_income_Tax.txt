Prime Minister Netanyahu, together with Finance Minister Yisrael Katz, is currently advancing an additional other economic plan that will include – inter alia – increased grants for negative income tax recipients. This plan follows a series of economic discussions held last week that were chaired by Prime Minister Netanyahu and Finance Minister Katz. The discussions were attended by the Governor of the Bank of Israel, the Prime Minister's Office Director General, the head of the National Economic Council, the Finance Ministry Director General and other senior officials. Prime Minister Netanyahu: "The Finance Minister and I are currently talking about submitting additional economic plans, including the promotion of a negative income tax, in order to encourage and reward going to work, and we have more plans on the way."
