On Sunday, we will hold the Cabinet meeting via video conference in order to maintain the distance. We are being an example to citizens and we hope that each one of you acts accordingly. We are investing considerable means right now to increase the pace of testing, to reduce the infection rate and – of course – to reinforce, strengthen and safeguard the medical teams, as well as many other things. You have no reason to storm supermarkets. There will be enough food in general and for the holiday. Have a good Shabbat, with much health." Also attending the discussions were National Security Council head Meir Ben-Shabbat, National Economic Council head Prof. Avi Simhon, Prime Minister's Office Director General Ronen Peretz, Health Ministry Director General Moshe Bar Siman Tov, Finance Ministry Director General Shai Babad and Finance Ministry Budget Director Shaul Meridor.
