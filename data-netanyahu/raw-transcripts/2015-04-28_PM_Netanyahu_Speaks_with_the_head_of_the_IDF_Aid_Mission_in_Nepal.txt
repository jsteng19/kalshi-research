Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with the head of the IDF aid mission to Nepal, Col. Yoram Larado, who is at the site where an IDF field hospital will be set up, and told him:

"The most important task at this moment is to rescue the Israelis who are on Mt. Everest and to complete the evacuation of the frozen lakes area. I have instructed that the possibility of dropping them equipment, food, clothing and means to keep warm, by plane or helicopter, be considered. Send my regards to everyone, good luck and keep up the good work."

Col. Larado said:

"We landed at dawn here in Kathmandu and immediately unpacked the equipment. As of now we are continuing to get organized, build the field hospital, and see to our other efforts, including the special effort to locate Israelis. Every Israeli who comes to us will have his needs taken care of. I would like to emphasize that we are highly motivated and ready for our task here; we are proud to represent the state and we hope to save lives and achieve results."
