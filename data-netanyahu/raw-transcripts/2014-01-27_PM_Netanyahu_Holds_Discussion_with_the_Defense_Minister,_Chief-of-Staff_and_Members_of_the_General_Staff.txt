Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this afternoon, in Jerusalem, held a discussion with Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon, IDF Chief-of-Staff Lt.-Gen. Benny Gantz and other members of the IDF General Staff. The discussion focused on the IDF's long-term plan.

At the start of the meeting, Prime Minister Netanyahu said, "In recent years the IDF has guarded Israelis' security very well, and this in the face of a regional upheaval the likes of which has not been seen since the foundation of the state. 2013 was the quietest year vis-Ã -vis Israelis' security in over a decade. On behalf of the citizens of Israel, I would like to convey to you all the great appreciation that we feel for you for the days and nights you are on guard. Our existence and our future here depend on a strong military and a strong military is built on strong people that have strong means. We will continue to see to it that the people who make up the strongest military in the region will continue to receive the conditions that ensure the continuation of our superiority."
