Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's bureau has released the following statement:

"Claims that Israel was unprepared to meet the tunnel threat are without foundation. It has been claimed that the tunnel threat had not been presented to the Cabinet prior to Operation Protective Edge and that the Cabinet did not know about tunnels that penetrated into our territory. This is false.

From 11 November 2013 until 3 July 2014, the tunnel threat was presented, in its full severity, at nine separate Cabinet meetings. The protocols show this beyond all doubt.

Moreover, for six months prior to the operation, from 16 January 2013 until 9 July 2014, the Prime Minister convened six professional discussions on the issue of the tunnels. The Defense Minister, IDF Chief-of-Staff, GOC Southern Command, head of the IDF Engineering Branch, head of the IDF Technology Branch and field commanders were among the participants in these meetings.

At these discussions, Prime Minister Netanyahu directed that operational and technological solutions be advanced to meet the tunnels threat.

On 3 July 2014, before the start of operations and two weeks before the ground incursion, the Prime Minister ordered the IDF to prepare for a ground incursion to neutralize the tunnels.

It is regrettable that there are those who have misled the public on substantive security issues when the facts are unequivocal and well known to those who are distorting them."
