Following the resolution passed by the UNESCO World Heritage Committee regarding the Tomb of the Patriarchs, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, decided to cut an additional $1 million from the membership funds that Israel pays to the UN and to transfer it to the establishment of "The Museum of the Heritage of the Jewish People in Kiryat Arba and Hebron" and to additional heritage projects related to Hebron. Against UNESCO's denial of the past, Prime Minister Netanyahu is determined to present to the entire world the historic truth and the Jewish People's deep connection – of thousands of years – to Hebron.
