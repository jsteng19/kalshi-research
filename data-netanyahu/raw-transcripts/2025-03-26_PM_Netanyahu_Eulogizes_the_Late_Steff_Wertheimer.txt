Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today: "My wife Sara and I express deep sorrow upon the passing of Steff Wertheimer, of blessed memory, a man of industry, vision and the Land of Israel. Steff was one of those who built the country, and a pillar of Israeli industry. Out of his love for the homeland, he chose to build factories in the Galilee and the Negev, not just to manufacture products, but to build the future. He believed that economic endeavors in the country were Zionist endeavors in every respect. Steff left behind a legacy of initiative, giving and abiding faith in the power of humanity to create and to do good. On behalf of myself, my wife and the Government of Israel, I send condolences to his family and those who loved him. May his memory be blessed."
