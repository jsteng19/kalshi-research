In the weekly cabinet meeting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that he will oppose the proposed conversion bill as it could cause a split within the Jewish people. The Prime Minister said he will try to reach an agreement to have the proposed bill removed from the Knesset's agenda, but if that endeavor proves unsuccessful, then he will call upon the Likud faction and the factions of the other coalition partners to oppose the bill.
