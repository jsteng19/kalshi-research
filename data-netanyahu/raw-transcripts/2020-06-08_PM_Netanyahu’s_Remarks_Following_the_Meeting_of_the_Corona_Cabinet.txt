Following are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s remarks, today, at the conclusion of the meeting of the Corona Cabinet: “We have just finished a meeting of the Corona Cabinet. It opened with a briefing by the experts who showed us that there has been a very steep increase in morbidity. It could be that we are already seeing the doubling of the rate of infection within ten days. I very much hope not. What we decided to do, first of all, is to hit the emergency brake. We stopped all of the measures to ease restrictions that we were going to apply in the coming days. We will check this again next week. One exception is event halls; we will allow them to operate according to the directives of the Health Ministry and we will report to you later on. The main thing that all the experts emphasized is that we must keep the three rules: Wearing masks, keeping two meters’ distance and hygiene – washing hands. I ask you, for our economy, for our health and for the lives of us all – please follow the rules.”
