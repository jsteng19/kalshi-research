Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, last night, had a warm conversation with Friedrich Merz, who following his victory in the German elections, has become Chancellor-designate, and congratulated him on his victory.

Chancellor-designate Merz thanked the Prime Minister for the conversation and said that he would invite him to make an official visit to Germany, in overt defiance of the scandalous International Criminal Court decision to label the Prime Minister a war criminal.
