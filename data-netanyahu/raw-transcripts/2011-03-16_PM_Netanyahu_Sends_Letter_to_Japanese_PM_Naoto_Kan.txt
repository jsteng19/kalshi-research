Following is the text of the letter that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sent today to Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan:

"Dear Mr. Prime Minister,

On behalf of the Government and people of Israel, I offer our heartfelt sympathies to you and to the people of Japan on the massive earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan and that has exacted such a horrific toll in human life.

The State of Israel stands ready to provide any kind of assistance which you may require. Israel can immediately dispatch disaster victim identity experts, medical personnel, water purification facilities or other things you may need.

The people of Israel stand with you at this difficult time. I have no doubt that the strength, resilience and fortitude that have always characterized the people of Japan will help you overcome this tragedy.

In friendship,

Benjamin Netanyahu"
