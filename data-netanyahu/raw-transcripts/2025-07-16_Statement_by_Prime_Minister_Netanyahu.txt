Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu:

"My brothers, the Druze citizens of Israel: the situation in Sweida, the situation in south-western Syria, is very serious.

The IDF is operating, the Air Force is operating, other forces are operating. We are acting to save our Druze brothers and to eliminate the gangs of the regime.

And now I have a single request of you: you are Israeli citizens. Do not cross the border. You are risking your lives; you could be murdered, you could be taken hostage, and you are impeding the efforts of the IDF. Therefore I ask of you: return to your homes and let the IDF take action".
