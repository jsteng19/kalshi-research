Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today:

"I congratulate the German Bundestag on the important decision branding the boycott movement (BDS) as an anti-Semitic movement and announcing that it is forbidden to fund it. I especially appreciate the announcement by the Bundestag that Germany must cease funding organizations that are working against the existence of the State of Israel. I hope that this decision will bring about concrete steps and I call upon other countries to adopt similar legislation."
