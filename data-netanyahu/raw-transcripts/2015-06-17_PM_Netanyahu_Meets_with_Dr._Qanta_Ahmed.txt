Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with Dr. Qanta Ahmed, a noted activist against Islamic extremism in the region and around the world. Dr. Ahmed has been active for many years in the struggle against the campaign of hatred, delegitimization and boycotts of Israel.

Also attending the meeting was MK Anat Berko who was among those who initiated last week's Knesset discussion on the war against attempted boycotts of Israel. Dr. Ahmed attended the conference.

Dr. Ahmed said that the world has much to learn from Israel regarding the war against extremist Islam in all its aspects â€“ terrorism, anti-Semitism and hatred. She added that this was a global problem that must be dealt with.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said that it is very important to hear voices such as Dr. Ahmed's around the world and added that she not only represents the truth but is not afraid to fight for it against lies and hatred. The Prime Minister noted that she is a true friend of the State of Israel.
