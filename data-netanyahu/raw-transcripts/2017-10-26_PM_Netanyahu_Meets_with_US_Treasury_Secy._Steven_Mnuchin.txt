Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem, met with US Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin. The Prime Minister welcomed him and said:

"I want to say how grateful we are for the support of the United States and the Trump Administration. Not only in terms of our security, which is critical for our future, but also in economic terms and the way we cooperate. I think that we do, not only in the government-to-government level, but between Israel's robust private sector and the great private sector of the United States, it is fundamental to our economic well-being. I deeply appreciate it."

US Treasury Secy. Mnuchin said: "It's great to see you again. It has been an honor to be with you and the President several times and I couldn't be more excited to be here on my first official visit, hopeful of many more. We don't have a better partner in the region than Israel."

Prime Minister Netanyahu thanked US Treasury Secy. Mnuchin for the Treasury Department's strong action against the Iranian regime, especially the Revolutionary Guards and their proxy Hezbollah.
