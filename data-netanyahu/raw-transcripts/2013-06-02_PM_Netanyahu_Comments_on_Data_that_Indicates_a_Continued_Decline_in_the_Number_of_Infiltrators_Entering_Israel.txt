Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, commented on the data that indicates a continued decline in the number of infiltrators who have entered Israeli territory and said, "The fence that we built in the south is achieving the result for which it was erected.

As opposed to the over 2,000 infiltrators who entered Israel exactly one year ago and dispersed to various cities, in May 2013 exactly two infiltrators crossed the border and were detained. Now we need to focus on repatriating the illegal infiltrators who are here, and we will meet this task as well."
