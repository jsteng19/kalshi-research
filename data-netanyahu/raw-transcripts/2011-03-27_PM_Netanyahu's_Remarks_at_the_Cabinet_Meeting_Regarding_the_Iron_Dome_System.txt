Following are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks at the weekly Cabinet meeting today regarding the Iron Dome system:

"Israel has been under missile threat for 20 years, since the Gulf War. I do not want to foster the illusion that

Iron Dome, which we are deploying today

, for the first time, will provide a complete or comprehensive answer.

Iron Dome is still in the experimental stage and we do not have the possibility of deploying batteries to protect every home, school, base and installation.

The true answer to the missile threat is a combination of aggressive and deterrent measures, protective measures and a strong stand by the Government and the public.

In any case, Israel holds Hamas responsible for everything fired at us from the Gaza Strip."
