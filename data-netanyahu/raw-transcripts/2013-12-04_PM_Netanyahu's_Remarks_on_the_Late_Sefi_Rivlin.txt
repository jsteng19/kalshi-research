Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today made the following remarks on the passing of Sefi Rivlin:

"Along with many in the country, I mourn the passing of my friend Sefi Rivlin. Sefi was a beloved artist who made generations of Israelis laugh with his sharp wit. He had solid national views and he never bent before the winds of what was fashionable. Alongside this he was always open to debate and friendly to those who held other views who respected and appreciated him. He was a good-hearted, principled, educated and outspoken man of values. He struggled bravely against his disease for many years in the spirit of optimism and hope that characterized him. I and the people of Israel will miss him very much."
