"We have no intention of interfering in Syria's internal affairs; however, we do intend to do what is necessary for our security.

As such, I approved the Air Force bombing of strategic military capabilities left by the Syrian military so that they will not fall into the hands of the jihadists.

This is similar to what the British Air Force did when it bombed the fleet of the Vichy regime, which was cooperating with the Nazis, so that it would not fall into the Nazis' hands.

We want to have relations with the new regime in Syria but if this regime allows Iran to re-establish itself in Syria, or allows the transfer of Iranian weapons, or weapons of any kind, to Hezbollah, or attacks us â€“ we will respond forcefully and we will exact a heavy price.

What happened to the previous regime will also happen to this one."
