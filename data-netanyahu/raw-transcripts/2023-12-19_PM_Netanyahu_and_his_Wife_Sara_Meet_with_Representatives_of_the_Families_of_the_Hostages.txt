Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara, this evening, at the _Kirya_ in Tel Aviv, met with representatives of the families of the hostages and listened attentively to their difficulty and pain. The Prime Minister reiterated his commitment to bring about the release of all of the hostages back home.

Prime Minister Netanyahu told the families:

"We are committed, and I am personally committed, to the release of all of the hostages. Rescuing them is the highest mission.

Just now I twice sent the Director of the Mossad to Europe to advance a process for the release of our hostages. I will spare no effort on the matter and the demand is to bring them all."

In response to a question from one of those present, the Prime Minister said:

"Will I succeed? I can guarantee you one thing – we are not stopping."

Sara Netanyahu said:

"Several weeks ago, I sent letters to the leaders' wives, mother-to-mother. I noted that kidnapping is a crime against humanity and I asked them to help us. I embrace you along with the entire people of Israel and I am certain that we will continue to do everything to bring your loved ones back home safely."

Coordinator for the Hostages and Missing Brig.-Gen. (Res.) Gal Hirsch, National Security Council Director Tzachi Hanegbi and the Prime Minister's Military Secretary, Maj.-Gen. Avi Gil, also attended the meeting.

This evening's meeting is part of a series of meetings held by the Prime Minister with the families of the hostages. The meetings – which are attended by Coordinator for the Hostages and Missing Brig.-Gen. (Res.) Gal Hirsch – are held in a forum that allows for in-depth and personal dialogue between the Prime Minister and the families.
