Maj.-Gen. Meir Kalifi is retiring from the IDF this week after 33 years, during which he served as a soldier and officer in the Paratroop Brigade. For the past 2.5 years, he has served as the Prime Minister's Military Secretary. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thanked him and said that, "The State of Israel may be proud of an officer such as yourself, of the example you set, and of your patriotism, reliability, capability and loyalty to your country. You were party to fateful decisions and dealt with the most sensitive issues related to the security and future of the State of Israel. I could not have wished for a better military secretary than the one I have had since taking office. I must say that I was unwilling to give up a man like you. You are leaving the IDF but your experience and contributions â€“ I am convinced that the State of Israel will find ways to benefit from your experience, abilities and dedication to the most important issues on the agenda. Therefore, I say 'Shalom' and 'See you soon.'"
