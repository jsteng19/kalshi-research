Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made the following remarks at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting today:

"We are determined to maintain quiet in the south. We will do so by a policy of preventive action and strong reaction against those who try to harm us or who harm us. I suggest that Hamas take our policy into account.

UNESCO announced, over the weekend, that it was cancelling an exhibit that it had planned to hold in France on the connection between the Jewish People and the Land of Israel.

The explanation given was that it would harm the negotiations. It would not harm the negotiations. Negotiations are based on facts, on the truth, which is never harmful. But what does harm the negotiations is the automatic summoning of Israeli ambassadors in certain countries regarding matters of no substance, while significant violations by the Palestinian Authority pass without a response.

The one-sided approach toward Israel does not advance peace â€“ it pushes peace further away. It strengthens the refusal of the PA to make actual progress in the negotiations. We hope that this conduct by the PA changes. The one-sided and unfair attitude toward the State of Israel does not advance the diplomatic process.

Today, for the first time, a great friend of the State of Israel, and a great friend of mine, is visiting Israel, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper.

Canada is a faithful friend of the State of Israel. Under Stephen Harper's leadership, it has taken a moral and steadfast position against attempts to delegitimize the State of Israel. Prime Minister Harper has expressed a clear, brave and moral stand regarding the truth and in regard to the standards that the international community needs to adopt regarding the State of Israel and the conflict here. I think that this is worthy of praise and I welcome him on behalf of the Government and people of Israel."
