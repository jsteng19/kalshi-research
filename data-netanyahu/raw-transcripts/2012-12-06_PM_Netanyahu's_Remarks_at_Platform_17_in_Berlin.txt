Prime Minister Netanyahu today at Platform 17 in Berlin, attended a memorial ceremony for the victims of the Holocaust. German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle also attended the ceremony.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said: "My presence here today symbolizes the victory of our people over those who tried to annihilate us. Over our history, the attacks have always come in two waves. The open and the familiar is a wave of physical assaults, expulsions, pogroms and murders. But there was always a prior wave of blood libels and terrible defamations against the Jewish People. Our people were helpless against these two elements but today we have established a state of our own. The IDF and the security forces defend our people from those who would try to destroy us and the Government of Israel, like all of its predecessors, tells the truth of Israel to the nations of the world."
