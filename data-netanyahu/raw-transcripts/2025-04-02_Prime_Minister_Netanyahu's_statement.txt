Statement by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today:

"Last night in the Gaza Strip, we switched gears. The IDF is seizing territory, striking the terrorists and destroying the infrastructure.

We are also doing something else: We are seizing the Morag Corridor. This will be the second Philadelphi, an additional Philadelphi Corridor.

Because we are now dividing the Strip and increasing the pressure step by step, so that they will give us our hostages. And as long as they do not give them to us, the pressure will increase until they do.

We are determined to achieve the objectives of the war, and we are acting relentlessly, and with a clear line and a clear mission.

And with G-d's help and that of our heroic soldiers, we will also achieve them."
