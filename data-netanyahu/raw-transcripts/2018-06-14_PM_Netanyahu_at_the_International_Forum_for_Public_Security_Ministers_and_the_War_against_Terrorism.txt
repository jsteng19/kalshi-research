PM Netanyahu – at International Forum for Public Security Ministers and the War against Terrorism – Commends German Parliament for Approving Israeli UAV Leasing Deal

PM Netanyahu, at the international forum for public security ministers and the war against terrorism, made the following remarks:

"I am very pleased by the decision of the German parliament yesterday to approve the giant deal to lease Israeli UAVs. This is an incredible deal that has implications, first of all, for our security industries and for the Israeli economy, but also for the continued strengthening of security relations between Israel and Germany. Germany helps Israel with security, and Israel also helps Germany. This is a very important development and I would like to personally thank Chancellor Merkel. I spoke with her about this ten days ago. She told me that she would pass it through the parliament and she did so."
