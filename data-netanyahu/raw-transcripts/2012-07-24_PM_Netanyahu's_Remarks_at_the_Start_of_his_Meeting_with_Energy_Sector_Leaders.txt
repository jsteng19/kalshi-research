Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made the following remarks today at the start of his meeting with energy sector leaders:

"Not only has the economic tumult that we are in not lessened, but it is, in fact, strengthening.

Last year saw lowered credit ratings for all of the leading countries; the US and the major countries in Europe. This did not happen to us because we stuck to the rules of responsible economic behavior and we will continue to do so.

We know one simple rule in economics that must be maintained – 'There is no free lunch.' We are submitting a decision to provide free pre-school education but it costs money, it is never free. We are completing the fence in order to stop infiltrators. Sixteen infiltrators crossed in last week and were all put in detention. This is a success that costs money. We are deploying various technologies and new weapons and defense systems against the new threats – and this costs money. 'There is no free lunch.' In order to finance this we need to make the necessary corrections in the budgets and we will do so at next Monday's Cabinet meeting and afterwards we will submit a responsible budget.

Whoever says that it is possible to spend indiscriminately, without coverage, for populist objectives – is simply endangering the State of Israel and could easily bring it to the situation that we have seen in leading European economies that are on the verge of bankruptcy. This has not happened here and I will not allow it to happen here.

We are maintaining security and the economy by acting responsibly. I intend to do the same thing in the energy sector. We need to develop, to enact many reforms and maintain a responsible framework for the country."
