Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem, met with the team members of Betar Jerusalem on the occasion of their winning the 2023 State Cup.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"I would like to tell you that two good things happened yesterday: One, we passed the budget for the State of Israel; and two, you brought the Cup back to Israel's capital. You played a great team game. Your rivals also played well but you played better.

We are happy for you. After 14 years, you closed the circle. I also want to tell you that as a fan, I share in the fans' joy but this needs to be restrained as well and kept within the rules. I am certain there will be more opportunities.

I really want to tell you that you did great work. During the budget, we sat and watched and almost missed a few votes, but you did not miss any opportunity. You really played magnificently. Then congratulations to you. Mazel tov Betar Jerusalem. Let's go Betar!"

Also attending the meeting with the Betar Jerusalem players were Culture and Sport Minister Miki Zohar, Economy Minister Nir Barkat, Jerusalem Mayor Moshe Lion, Jerusalem Municipality Director General Itzik Lari, team owner Barak Abramov, coach Yossi Abukasi and other senior team officials.
