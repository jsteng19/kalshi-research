Following are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks at his meeting today with

ZAKA

volunteers:

"First of all, thank you Yehuda and Michael, and each and every one of you. You do holy work.

You are familiar with Deuteronomy 4:15 – 'Take good heed unto yourselves'? Three times a day, then this is the verse. You work both before and after the disaster.

We are pleased that the number of disasters in the country, the number of terrorist attacks, has declined. This is no coincidence. This is the result of policy even though, as you are well aware, we live in a very harsh and dangerous environment. Therefore, that you have been less busy with terrorist attacks makes us all happier – of course – but this will not necessarily continue, and you are prepared, come what may.

But you also do very many things vis-à-vis prevention and you could yet do much more. I know that you are now coming into the summer vacation when people, including haredi youth, go on trips and hikes into the desert. I was a kid once, not haredi, but a kid, and I went into the desert. And if you are unfamiliar with the area, you can simply be swept away in an instant or fall from a cliff.

I would be pleased if you would undertake to educate haredi youth and others to be careful while on hikes, to take good heed of themselves so that you won't be busy afterwards, and none of us will be busy afterwards.

First of all, I would like to commend you for the many things you have done, and are doing, in the country and around the world. You have become ambassadors for the State of Israel, ambassadors of goodwill and our good name. Thank the Almighty, you carry the name of the State of Israel and the Jewish People with you around the world and I would like to thank you for it. You are messengers who deserve all blessings. Continue, successfully, with your holy work.

Thank you from the heart."
