Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, made the following remarks at the start of the Cabinet meeting: "In recent weeks we have seen a stepped-up Iranian effort to intensify terrorist actions in Judea and Samaria. None other than the Palestinian Authority ambassador in Teheran said that he was enthused by Iranian ruler Khamenei's instructions to send weapons to the West Bank and he added, and I quote, 'The Zionist regime is an aggressive cancerous growth which, sooner or later, must be eliminated.' Now I emphasize, it was not a Hamas man who said this, it was the Palestinian Authority ambassador in Teheran. Now what is the UN doing in response? Instead of dealing with this incitement they are giving it an honored place, the same incitement that has led to the recent terrorist attack, and they are also moving forward on a unilateral Palestinian proposal to try and pass a decision in the Security Council, the purpose of which is to bring about a forced settlement that would establish here a second Hamastan and would endanger our security. This is the same UN the Human Rights Council of which passed dozens of decisions this year against Israel, one decision on Iran and one decision on Syria. We will continue to insist on our truth and we will also continue to vigorously rebuff attempts to force terms on us that would endanger our security and our future. We expect national unity on this national issue."
