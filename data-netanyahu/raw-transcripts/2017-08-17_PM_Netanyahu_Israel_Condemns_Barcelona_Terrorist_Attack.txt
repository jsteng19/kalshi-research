Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu:

"Israel strongly condemns the terrorist attack in Barcelona. On behalf of the citizens of Israel, I send condolences to the families of those who were killed and wishes for a quick recovery to the injured. This evening we again saw that terror strikes everywhere; the civilized world must fight it together in order to defeat it."
