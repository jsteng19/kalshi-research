Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Deputy Minister for Senior Citizens Affairs Dr. Leah Nass, in cooperation with the Israel Postal Company, today, launched the "Thanks to Them" stamp in honor of Israel's senior citizens.

The stamp was launched on the occasion of Israel's 65th year of independence and symbolizes the universal senior citizen's age. The stamp features the hands of a senior citizen fashioning a Jewish star – symbolizing the State of Israel and the Jewish People – from clay. Through the stamp, the State of Israel expresses its appreciation for its senior citizens' great contribution in building the Land and establishing the State, and seeks to impress gratitude upon the younger generation for what has been done for it.
