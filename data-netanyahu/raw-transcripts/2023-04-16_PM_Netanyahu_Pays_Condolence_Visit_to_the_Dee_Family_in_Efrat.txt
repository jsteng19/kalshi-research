Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, toda', paid a condolence visit to the Dee family in Efrat. The Prime Minister heard from the father of the family, Rabbi Leo Dee, about ther aliyah to Israel and said that he knew that if the Rabbi's late wife had been asked about it, she would have replied that she had no regrets and would do the same thing again. Prime Minister Netanyahu noted that unfortunately, "The land of Israel is acquired through trials and tribulations," and told Rabbi Dee that, "Now, your wife and daughters will live within us." The daughter, Tali Dee, asked the Prime Minister how he deals with the loss of his brother. Prime Minister Netanyahu replied that at first he thought life was over, and said that when he was told during the week of mourning that life went on, he refused to believe it. However, the Prime Minister added that they were right and said that while the pain they now felt would remain throughout their lives, it would not always be that strong. Prime Minister Netanyahu was accompanied by the Prime Minister's Chief of Staff Tzachi Braverman, the Prime Minister's Military Secretary Maj.-Gen. Avi Gil and Cabinet Secretary Yossi Fuchs.
