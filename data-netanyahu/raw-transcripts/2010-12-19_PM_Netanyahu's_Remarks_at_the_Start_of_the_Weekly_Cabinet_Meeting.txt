Following are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting today:

"To our deep sorrow, firefighter Danny Hayat passed away last night after fighting for his life for two weeks. Danny courageously fought the fire in an heroic attempt to save the Prison Service bus. My wife and I visited him in hospital. We met his wife Hofit, who is due to give birth. We met his parents, Motti and Batsheva, and we discovered a strong, united and brave family. Despite all the prayers and the efforts, Danny passed away. Our hearts – the Government's and the nation's – are with the Hayat family.

Firefighters selflessly fought the Carmel wildfire in order to take control of the flames and to try and rescue the Prison Service bus, which was caught in the heart of the inferno. In light of the special circumstances regarding the bus and of the firefighters' heroism, today, I am submitting for Cabinet approval, a proposal; to give to the firefighters' families rights similar to those given to the families of fallen IDF soldiers. These rights will be given to firefighters Uri Semandayev, bus driver David Navon, Danny Hayat and remarkable 16-year-old volunteer Elad Riven, who dropped everything and went to save others.

The nation bows its head in deepest appreciation."
