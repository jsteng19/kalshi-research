Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, convened the Cabinet in order to make decisions the goal of which is to lead to the blocking and lowering of the basic reproduction number less than 1 and the number of new cases a day to less than 1,000. The Cabinet decided: 1. If the basic reproduction number reaches 1.32 or there are 2,500 new cases a day, Israel will go over to tightened restraint for three weeks. 2. If after three weeks from the start of tightened restraint, the basic reproduction number does not decline to 1, a general lockdown will be imposed. 3. There will be no additional restrictions for Chanukah.
