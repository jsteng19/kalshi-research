Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, at the weekly Cabinet meeting today made the following remarks regarding the main points of the Jewish People Policy Institute's assessment for 2014-2015:

"The Jewish People have no future without the State of Israel and the Jews of the Diaspora have no future without the state of the Jews. Thus, in order to ensure the future of the people, one must ensure the future of the state. The very existence of the State of Israel is under an attack from two elements: First – the physical threat as reflected in Iran's attempts to arm itself with nuclear weapons, and second – the threat posed by the global delegitimization campaign that denies our right to exist. Therefore, we are working to ensure that Israel will have the physical means to defend its citizens and we are waging a determined campaign against the movements to boycott Israel and deny its right to exist. The key to dealing with these threats is an active – not just defensive – approach; we must denounce those who would slander us and seek our ill."
