Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke this evening with US Middle East envoy George Mitchell and thanked him for his efforts to advance the peace process. The Prime Minister expressed his regrets over envoy Mitchell's decision to resign and that the Palestinians refused to attend the talks that he worked to advance, raised endless pre-conditions that impeded his work, and – in the end – joined with Hamas.
