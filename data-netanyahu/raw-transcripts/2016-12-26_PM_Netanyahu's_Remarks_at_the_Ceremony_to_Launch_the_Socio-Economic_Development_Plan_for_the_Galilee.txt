Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made the following remarks today in Maalot-Tarshiha, at the ceremony to launch the Socio-Ecoomic Development Plan for the Galilee:

"I read in several newspapers this morning that they are complaining about my vigorous stand against the countries that voted against us at the UN. Israel is a country with national pride and we do not turn the other cheek. This is a responsible, measured and vigorous response, the natural response of a healthy people that is making it clear to the nations of the world that what was done at the UN is unacceptable to us.

There is continuing importance to this response even if there is another attempt or two to harm us in the coming month. But there is no alternative to a determined response because it is, in effect, creating the basis for a different approach in the future. Therefore, to describe our protest as a world war is ridiculous. I suggest â€“ enough of this Diaspora-think. I tell you that there is no diplomatic wisdom in being ingratiating. Not only will our relations with the nations of the world not be harmed, over time they will only improve because the nations of the world respect strong countries that stand up for themselves and do not respect weak ingratiating countries that bow their heads.

Under my leadership Israel is a strong and proud nation. We will continue to defend our state and we will develop the country."
