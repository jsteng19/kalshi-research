Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued the following statements:

"The UN Human Rights Council has become an anti-Israel circus. It attacks the only democracy in the Middle East and ignores the gross violations of Iran, Syria and North Korea. The absurdity is that instead of dealing with the Palestinians' terrorist attacks and those of Daesh in Europe, it decides to condemn Israel. Israel calls on responsible governments not to honor the decisions of the Council that discriminate against Israel."

"What happened today in Hebron does not represent the values of the IDF. The IDF expects its soldiers to behave level-headedly and in accordance with the rules of engagement."
