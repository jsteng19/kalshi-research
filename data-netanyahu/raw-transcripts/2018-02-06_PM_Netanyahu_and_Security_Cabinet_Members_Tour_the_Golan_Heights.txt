Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and members of the Security Cabinet, today, toured the Golan Heights (Mt. Avital overlook) and were briefed by IDF Chief-of-Staff Lt.-Gen. Gadi Eizenkot, GOC Northern Command Maj.-Gen. Yoel Strick and the commander of the IDF Bashan Division. The tour was to enhance the knowledge of Security Cabinet members.

"I am now concluding the tour of IDF Northern Command that we held this morning with the members of the Security Cabinet. I am impressed by the major work the IDF is doing to defend our borders and our state. We want peace but we are prepared for any scenario and I suggest that no one test us.

I similarly promised the widow of Rabbi Raziel Shevach that we would settle accounts with his murderer. I want to praise the ISA, Israel Police and the IDF for doing exactly this.

So it will be with the abhorrent murderer of Rabbi Itamar Ben-Gal. We are all with his family and his widow."
