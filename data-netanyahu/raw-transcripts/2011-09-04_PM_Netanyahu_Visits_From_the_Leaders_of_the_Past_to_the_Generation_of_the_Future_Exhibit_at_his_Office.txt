Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this morning, visited the "From the Leaders of the Past to the Generation of the Future" exhibit that is currently on display at the Prime Minister's Office and which deals with the activities of previous presidents and prime ministers.

The exhibit features the work of grade 8th and 9th grade pupils from throughout the education system who participated in a new study program initiated by the Council for the Commemoration of Presidents and Prime Ministers in cooperation with the Education Ministry.

The goal of the program is to familiarize pupils with the history of Israel's 12 presidents and prime ministers who have passed on. By examining their careers, thousands of pupils are exposed to the history of the State of Israel and study various issues regarding leadership, social change and education for responsibility and commitment.

One item that particularly impressed Prime Minister Netanyahu was an illustration entitled "Golda's Kitchen Cabinet", on display at the entrance to his Bureau, by pupils from the Golda Meir Middle School in Nes Tziona. The illustration is part of a series depicting the life of Golda Meir, including her political and diplomatic career.
