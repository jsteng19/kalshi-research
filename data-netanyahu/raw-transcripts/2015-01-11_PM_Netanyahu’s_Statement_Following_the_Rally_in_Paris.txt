Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this afternoon made the following remarks after the rally in Paris:

“I marched now in one row with world leaders in order to unite against terrorism. I told them that terrorism, any terrorism, must be fought to the end.

I would like to thank our security people, and the French security services, for allowing us – despite not inconsiderable difficulties – to participate in this important rally and to represent the citizens of the State of Israel.”
