Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today, in his Jerusalem office, met with the participants in the annual International Bible Contest for Jewish Youth: approximately 50 young people, aged 13-15, from approximately 20 countries.

"I suggest that you not only study for the Independence Day quiz and succeed in it but that you continue your studies throughout your lives. We have no greater treasure, and both you and the Jewish People will be enriched," the Prime Minister said.
