Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, met with Indian External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj and said at the start of their meeting:

It’s a true honor and a true delight to be here.

There’s a lot of enthusiasm, not only in our meetings at the level of governments and leaders, but also in the people. I see this and it’s heartwarming. So I want to thank you for this welcome, and I look forward to discussing with you how we can further improve our ties.

[Translated from the Hebrew]

We are here in India on a historic visit. It is important for the State of Israel that one of the world's major powers wants to develop close relations in many areas – economics, trade, security and agriculture.

But even where I am here in India, I think of you, IDF soldiers, and of the splendid work that you did yesterday in eliminating another tunnel. We are systematically eliminating the tunnel infrastructure of Hamas and Islamic Jihad; they should not try us."

Indian External Affairs Minister Swaraj said, "Very warm welcome to India. The feeling is mutual. We were eagerly looking forward to your visit and after the visit of Prime Minister Modi, all of us were very excited to receive you in India. And today, that dream has come true."

Minister Swaraj emphasized the warm and special friendship between the two countries and said that they want to deepen cooperation in all areas. She pointed out the fact that the reciprocal visits in the past year reflect the friendship between the countries.
