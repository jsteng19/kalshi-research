Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara, this evening, express deep sorrow over the passing of Miriam Eshkol, who had been a personal friend of theirs for many years.

Miriam Eshkol had worked tirelessly toward the establishment of a visitor's center in memory of her late husband, former Prime Minister Levi Eshkol, which is due to open soon. "We regret that she will not be able to dedicate the center for which she had worked so hard," they said.
