PM Netanyahu: I’m very pleased to welcome Rahm Emanuel to this office and to Israel. I understand that you’ve had a busy week. I understand your son has had a busy week. We want to wish him our best wishes and to your entire family. You are very welcome here and I look forward to our conversation.

Emanuel: Mr. Prime Minister – into the mike? Nobody has ever had trouble hearing me.

On behalf of the President – you will be in Canada, and he has asked me to extend an invitation to you to come visit him at the White House for a working meeting to discuss both our shared security interests as well as our full cooperation on seeking peace between Israel and its neighbors.

And also, on a personal matter – on behalf of the Emanuel family, I would like to say that this trip has been a wonderful trip for the entire Emanuel family, most importantly for me to show my children – given so much, as you know, about my childhood was here – to show them the country and expose them to the history in a very intimate way and most importantly, to the most important thing about Israel, to the people who have been exceptionally warm and genuine in their affection to both all the family in general, but particularly to Zack on his Bar Mitzvah, in wishing him a Mazal Tov.

So it has been heartfelt and nothing more than a father could wish his son on his Bar Mitzvah, the way the Israeli people have treated him. Now if we could just get him to do his homework, we’ll be very happy.

PM: It sounds like an impossible task, but we were shown that we can do the impossible.

Emanuel: Yes you have. I’m looking for all assistance. But it’s been a great trip and a wonderful trip, and the entire Administration and the President particularly looks forward to your visit on June 1st. Thank you.

PM: Thank you. I gladly accept.
