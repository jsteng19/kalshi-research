Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this evening voted for the law that would bar illegal work infiltrators from withdrawing funds from Israel until their departure from the country. "We have blocked the phenomenon of infiltration into Israel. Last month only two infiltrators crossed the border, as opposed to over 2,000 one year ago. Now we are focusing on the infiltrators' departure from sIsrael. Several thousand infiltrators have already left Israel and we are continuing to work on repatriating the illegal work infiltrators already here," the Prime Minister said.
