Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening: "I send condolences to the people of Oman, and share in the deep sorrow, on the passing of Sultan Qaboos Bin Said. About a year ago he invited my wife and I for an important and very moving visit during which he offered his assistance in advancing peace and stability in the region. He was an outstanding leader who worked tirelessly to advance peace and stability in our region. Under his leadership, Oman became a significant and advanced country. I congratulate the new sultan, Haitham bin Tariq, on his appointment and his remarks that Oman's foreign policy and its work for peace in the region would continue."
