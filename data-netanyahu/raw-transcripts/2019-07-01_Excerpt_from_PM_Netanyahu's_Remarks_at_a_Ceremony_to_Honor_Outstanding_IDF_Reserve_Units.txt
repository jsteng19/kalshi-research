Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, at the President's Residence in Jerusalem, spoke at a ceremony to honor outstanding IDF reserve units. Following is an excerpt from his remarks: "Our cohesion in trying times and in the moments leading up to trying times, is – in the end – the key to our strength. I regret the tragic loss of life of Solomon Tekah in Haifa last night. We all send condolences to his family. I spoke about this today with the Acting Police Commissioner, who promised me that a major effort was being made to arrive at the truth as quickly as possible. The Ethiopian community is dear to all of us. We have made a great effort in recent years to optimize its integration into Israeli society, and we still have much work to do."
