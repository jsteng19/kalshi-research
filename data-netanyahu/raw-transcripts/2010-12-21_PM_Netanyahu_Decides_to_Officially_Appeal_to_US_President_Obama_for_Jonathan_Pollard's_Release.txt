Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu decided to accede to Jonathan Pollard's personal request and will, in the coming days, officially and publicly appeal to US President Barack Obama regarding Pollard's release.

The decision to accede to the request, which Prime Minister Netanyahu received in writing, in a letter brought by Esther Pollard, was made following a series of talks and contacts which the Prime Minister and his representatives have held on the issue in recent months with senior US administration officials.

It will be recalled that Prime Minister Netanyahu – during his previous term in office – recognized Jonathan Pollard as an Israeli agent. Later, he personally visited with him in prison. He has raised the issue with US Presidents during both of his terms as Prime Minister.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said that, "I intend to continue acting with determination for Pollard's release, both because of the State of Israel's moral obligation to him and so that he might live with his family and restore himself to health after his prolonged incarceration."
