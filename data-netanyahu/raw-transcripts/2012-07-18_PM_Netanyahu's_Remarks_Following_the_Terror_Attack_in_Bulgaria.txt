Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is holding security consultations following the terror attack in Bulgaria.

The Prime Minister said: “All signs point towards Iran. Over the last few months we have seen Iran’s attempts to attack Israelis in Thailand, India, Georgia, Kenya, Cyprus and other countries. Exactly 18 years to the day after the horrendous attack on the Jewish Community Center in Argentina, deadly Iranian terrorism continues to strike at innocent people. This is a global Iranian terror onslaught and Israel will react firmly to it.”

The Prime Minister sends his condolences to the families of the victims and wishes a speedy recovery to the wounded.
