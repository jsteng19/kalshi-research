Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today: “I have made it clear that whoever hurts us – we will hurt him. This is what we did overnight vis-à-vis military targets of the Iranian Al Quds force and Syrian military targets in Syria after a barrage of rockets was launched at Israel. We will continue to vigorously maintain the security of Israel.”
