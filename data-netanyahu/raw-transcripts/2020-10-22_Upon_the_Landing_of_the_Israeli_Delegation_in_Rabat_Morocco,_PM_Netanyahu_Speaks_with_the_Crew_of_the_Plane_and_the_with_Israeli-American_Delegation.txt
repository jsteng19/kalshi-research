Upon the landing of the Israeli delegation in Rabat Morocco, today , Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with the crew of the plane and the members of the Israeli-American delegation.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"Merhava bikum. I am very moved to speak with you. This is a historic flight, another breakthrough for peace, true peace, with mutual respect, from strength, peace for peace. I would like to emphasize that there have been four peace agreements in four months. We are creating a new era of peace, prosperity and hope for our region, for our peoples and for our future. I would like you to convey my greetings to the King of Morocco who is doing a historic thing. We are changing the future of the two peoples, who are indeed marvelously linked. Nevertheless, the direct flights, the opening of offices and everything that will follow symbolize an era of wonderful peace. I congratulate the King of Morocco for the decision that is so important to all of us."

Transportation and Road Safety Minister MK (Brig.-Gen., ret.) Miri Regev:

"As a member of the Moroccan community in Israel, this is an especially exciting day for the entire people of Israel and me personally. I would like to commend Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for leading the historic peace agreements and to wish him that he might continue for many years to lead Israel to peace from strength with new and additional peace agreements that will lead to the prosperity of Israel and the building up of its security in the region."
