Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening: "Together with alI citizens of Israel, I deeply mourn the passing of David Levy, of blessed memory – a dedicated public servant for decades, a minister and deputy prime minister. David, who was born in Morocco, paved his way in life with his own two hands. In the local sphere, he contributed to the development of Beit She'an, which became a symbol for the growth of the development towns on the periphery. In the national sphere, he put his personal stamp on political life, while looking out for distressed weaker sectors As Minister of Foreign Affairs and Deputy Prime Minister, David helped forge diplomatic ties with countries that had refrained from doing so during the Cold War. His visits to world capitals were characterized by pride at being a devoted representative of the State of Israel. I cooperated with David in Likud governments, and with his children who – like him – successfully integrated into national politics. We did not always agree on everything, but I always admired his sense of mission. My wife Sara and I convey our condolences to the extended Levy family in the knowledge that David's precious memory will be enshrined in hearts of our people for years and generations.”
