Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening:

"The charge that Israel deliberately attacked UNIFIL personnel is completely false.

It's exactly the opposite. Israel repeatedly asked UNIFIL to get out of harm’s way. It repeatedly asked them to temporarily leave the combat zone, which is right next to Israel’s border with Lebanon.

In fact, on the day that Israel began its ground operation next to our border with Lebanon, we asked them specifically, 'Please leave this area so you're not harmed.'

Israel is not fighting UNIFIL. It's not fighting the people of Lebanon. It is fighting Iran’s proxy Hezbollah, which uses Lebanese territory to attack Israel. Hezbollah attacked Israel last year without any provocation on October 8th, a day after the Hamas massacre, and it's continued to attack us ever since by launching over 10,000 rockets and missiles at Israel.

Hezbollah uses UNIFIL facilities and positions as cover while it attacks Israeli cities and communities. These attacks have claimed the lives of many Israelis, including yesterday.

Israel has every right to defend itself against Hezbollah and will continue to do so.

We regret any harm done to UNIFIL personnel and the IDF is doing its utmost to prevent such incidents.

But the best way to assure the safety of UNIFIL personnel is for UNIFIL to heed Israel's request and to temporarily get out of harm’s way."
