Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made the following remarks at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting:

"Operation Protective Edge is continuing. At no stage did we declare its conclusion. The operation will continue until its goal is met â€“ the restoration of a quiet for a long period. I said at the outset of, and throughout, the operation that it would take time and patience. Israel will not negotiate under fire and Israel will continue to take all action in order to change the current reality and bring quiet to all of its citizens. We will stand together, united and determined, until we complete the work."
