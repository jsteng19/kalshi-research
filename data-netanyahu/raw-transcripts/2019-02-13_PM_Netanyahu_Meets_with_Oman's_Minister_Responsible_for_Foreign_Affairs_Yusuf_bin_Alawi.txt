Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in Warsaw, met with the Sultanate of Oman's Minister Responsible for Foreign Affairs Yusuf bin Alawi.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said at the start of the meeting:

"It’s a delight to see you again.

The courageous decision of Sultan Qaboos to invite me to Oman is changing the world. It’s pointing the way for many others to do what you said, not to be stuck in the past, but to seize the future.

Many are following this lead, and may I say, including in this conference.

I thank you for this positive policy that can lead to peace and prosperity for all. I want to thank you on behalf of the people of Israel, and I allow myself to say on behalf of many people in the Middle East."

Oman's Minister Responsible for Foreign Affairs Yusuf bin Alawi:

"This is an important and new vision for the future. People of the Middle East have suffered a lot because they are stuck to the past. This is a new era for the future and for prosperity for every nation."
