PM Netanyahu spoke with gold medal-winning judoka Sagi Muki:

"You are golden; you promised, and you did it. There are two great things here. There is a fantastic gold here and much hope for Israeli judo. There is much hope when we hear our national anthem; everyone is moved by this honor and pride. It is not only your personal achievement and the Jewish achievement of Israeli sports, but also the fact that the anthem was being played in Abu Dhabi. You know that I was recently in the area, not far away. Sagi, you are also contributing to Israel's diplomatic effort in the Arab world. For all these reasons, congratulations!"
