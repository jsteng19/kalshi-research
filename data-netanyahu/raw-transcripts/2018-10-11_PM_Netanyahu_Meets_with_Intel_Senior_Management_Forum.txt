PM Netanyahu, at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem, met with senior Intel managers and said at the start of the meeting:

"Seven years ago I said that Israel will be the leading, global power in cybersecurity and that has happened. And now I'm saying that Israel is and will be an even greater force in global technology of transportation.

I think we're proving in our cooperation that the future belongs to those who innovate. Intel is an innovation company, Israel is an innovation nation. The partnership with Intel is tremendous. We look forward to expanding it even more. And I want to thank you for doing good things. For recognizing good things, we recognize in Israel good things when we see it.

Intel has invested $38 billion – It is an amazing investment with amazing result. I think you were among the first to recognize the great potential of Israel and the great potential of our partnership. Now everybody invests in Israel today with R & D but you're different. Because you're not just investing in R & D, you're investing also in production and export. And that is obviously very, very important for Israel. But we think the partnership between the Israeli companies and Intel is enormous."

Global technology development and innovation, with emphasis on – inter alia – smart transportation, cyber and digital health were among the issues discussed at the meeting. Also discussed was Israel's status as a global research and development center for hundreds of leading companies.
