Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made the following remarks at the Cabinet meeting today:

“I would like to inform the ministers about two things. First, I asked Attorney General Yehuda Weinstein to find a solution for the Ulpana neighborhood [in Beit El] that would obviate the need for demolition. Second, it is my intention to submit to the Cabinet soon, with the recommendation of Defense Minister Ehud Barak, the necessary permits for providing for the status of the communities of Bruchin, Sansana and Rechalim.”
