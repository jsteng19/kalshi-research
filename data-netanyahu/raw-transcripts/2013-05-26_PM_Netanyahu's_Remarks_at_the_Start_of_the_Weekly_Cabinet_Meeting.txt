Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made the following remarks at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting:

"Today we will start national emergency week. Home Front Protection Minister Gilad Erdan will brief us in detail on the issue. The threats against the Israeli home front have significantly increased in recent years. Israel is the most threatened state in the world; it is under missile and rocket threat. We are prepared for any scenario.

In recent years we have significantly increased the preparedness of the home front vis-à-vis such attacks and other stacks. We are investing billions so that the home front will be better protected and better prepared. We are investing in Iron Dome, sirens, shelters, structural reinforcement, and improved early warning systems. We will make legislative changes so as to adapt the legal reality in the State of Israel to the security reality and the concomitant threats.

An appreciable proportion of these changes have already been seen. It was possible to see them in the functioning of the home front during Operation Pillar of Defense, but even so one must remember that it is difficult to achieve complete protection. In the end, no protection can be a substitute for the striking power of the IDF and the stamina and strength of the Israeli public in time of attack.

I thank – in advance – the public, ministers and ministries for their cooperation, for the important work of the IDF and Home Front Command. Through cooperation we will be better prepared.

Thank you."
