Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this morning, at Ben-Gurion International Airport, made the following remarks prior to leaving for Chad:

"I am now leaving on another historic and important breakthrough, to Chad, a huge Muslim country bordering Libya and Sudan. This is part of the revolution that we are doing in the Arab and Islamic worlds; I promised you that this would happen. There will be more major news. There will be more countries.

This is very disturbing and even causes outrage in Iran and among the Palestinians who are trying to prevent this. They will not succeed."
