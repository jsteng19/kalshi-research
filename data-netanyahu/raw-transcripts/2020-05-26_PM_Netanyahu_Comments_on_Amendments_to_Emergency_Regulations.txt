Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"We received very happy news today. The Cabinet has approved the opening of the restaurants, pubs, bars, major parks and swimming pools. First, we want to help the economy â€“ the business owners and the self-employed who have hoped for this moment. Second, we want to make your lives easier, to allow you to go out and get some air, to go back to routine as much as possible, to drink a cup a coffee, and to have a beer as well. So, first of all, enjoy yourselves, but we are monitoring developments, including the trends in morbidity; we are prepared accordingly. I hope that we will not have to make changes."
