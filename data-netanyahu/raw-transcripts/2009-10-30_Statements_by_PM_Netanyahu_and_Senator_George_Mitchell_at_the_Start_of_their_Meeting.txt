PM Netanyahu

: Very good to see you again Senator Mitchell and I look forward to our discussions, and the discussions with Secretary of State, Clinton, to try to re-launch the peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians as soon as possible. I also wanted to take this opportunity to express my appreciation for the president's ongoing efforts to stop Iran from acquiring nuclear military capability. I think that the proposal that the president made in Geneva to have Iran withdraw its enriched uranium, or a good portion of it, outside Iran is a positive first step in that direction, and I support and appreciate the president's ongoing effort to unite the international community to address the challenge of Iran's attempts to become a nuclear military power.

Senator Mitchell

: Mr. Prime Minister thank you very much for your comments. As always I look forward to our discussions to achieve our common objective of a comprehensive peace in the region and I appreciate again your courtesy in seeing me as you often have in the past.
