Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, at the Knesset: "When the issue is security, we do not rest even for a moment. The IDF thwarted an attempt to plant explosives on the Syrian front. Yesterday, we took action in the Gaza Strip regarding renegade fire and of course the matter with Lebanon is still in the air. We will hit anyone who tries to attack us and this principle applies to anyone who does attack us."
