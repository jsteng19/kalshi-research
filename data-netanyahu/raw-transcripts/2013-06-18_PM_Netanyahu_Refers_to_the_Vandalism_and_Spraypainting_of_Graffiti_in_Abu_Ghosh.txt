Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, at the start of his meeting with Jewish Agency Chairman Natan Sharansky on the issue of advancing Jewish education in the Diaspora, referred to the vandalism of vehicles and spraypainting of graffiti in Abu Ghosh:

"What happened today in Abu Ghosh contravenes the precepts of Judaism, and the values of our people and our state. Just this week we passed decisions that will enable us to take strong action against those who perpetrate such crimes, and we will do so with full force."
