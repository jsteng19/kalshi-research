Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, at Soroka Medical Center in Be'er Sheva, met with IDF officer Captain Ziv Shilon, who was wounded along the Gaza Strip fence last week, and told him: "The entire country embraces and supports you. I thank you on behalf of the entire nation. I am very impressed by your strength."

Prime Minister Netanyahu gave Capt. Shilon a (Hebrew) copy of the book "The Letters of Yoni (Jonathan) Netanyahu" with a personal dedication in which the former wrote: "To an admired soldier and commander, for your bravery and your sacrifice in safeguarding the homeland. The Jewish People salute you."

Capt. Shilon thanked Prime Minister Netanyahu and said: "Thank you Mr. Prime Minister for coming here. I have had many visitors and it is very encouraging. The State of Israel and its people need security, including self-sacrifice if need be. It was to this end that I joined the IDF."

Following the visit, Prime Minister Netanyahu met with Be'er Sheva Mayor Rubik Danilovitz and told him, "Hamas hides among the civilian population and fires from there at our communities. We will respond in strength to every place from which we are fired at."
