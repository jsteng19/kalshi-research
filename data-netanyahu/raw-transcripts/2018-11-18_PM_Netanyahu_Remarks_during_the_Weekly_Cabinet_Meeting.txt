Prime Minister Netanyahu, during the weekly Cabinet meeting, made the following remarks:

"Today the Cabinet approved two important decisions. The first corrects 'the lack of tenure and employment security' for those serving in the security establishment.

This is good news for police officers, police retirees, the Prison Service, the ISA and the Mossad, for those who serve the security of the state with dedication. This is news that they have been hoping for for many years. This decision was submitted to the Cabinet together with the Finance and Public Security ministers.

The second important decision is the reserving of a budgetary source for the aid package for Sderot and the communities in the area adjacent to the Gaza Strip, as I promised together with the Finance and Interior ministers at our meeting with the heads of council from the area adjacent to the Gaza Strip last Thursday."
