Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, attended the 6th Negev Conference in Sderot and discussed the actions of his government (Israel's 33rd) during its first year in office:

"Today, we are marking exactly one year since the government was formed. One of the main goals that we set was to develop the Negev and the Galilee and bring them closer to the center. We have invested more than NIS 10 billion in transportation infrastructures. We built a railway station here in Sderot. Be'er Sheva is becoming a global cyber center. We blocked illegal migration. In the wake of Operation Pillar of Defense, quiet – of a kind unknown in a decade – has prevailed here. There will be no trickle of rockets. My policy is clear: Any firing of rockets will be met with an immediate and sharp response.

In the past year, we have built up Israel's security in the face of regional turmoil and the Israeli economy has continued to grow more than the economies of the world which are still dealing with an economic crisis. There has been an impressive series of achievements here especially given the short time in which they have occurred. Some of them are due to the implementation of decisions taken by the previous government. In the coming year, we can expect to see further results of decisions taken by the new government."

* In 2013, NIS 12.8 billion were invested in transportation infrastructures throughout the country in order to link the Negev and the Galilee with the center. Such projects include: Golani interchange, the Sderot railway station, widening the Jerusalem-Tel Aviv highway, the Krayot bypass road (in Haifa's northern suburbs) and Yagur interchange.

* Illegal migration into Israel has been blocked. The 242-kilometer border fence in the south has been completed and the number of illegal migrants entering Israel's cities has declined to zero.

* 2013 was the quietest year in the south in a decade.

* The implementation of free education for toddlers: The parents of approximately 290,000 children from ages 3-4 enjoy free education, a savings of NIS 800 per month per child.

* Growth in 2013 was among the highest in the West (3.3% in Israel as opposed to the OECD average of 1.2%).

* Unemployment in 2013 was among the lowest in the world (6.2% in Israel as opposed to the OECD average of 8%).

* Tel Aviv is ranked 2nd on Startup Genome's Startup Ecosystem index, right behind Silicon Valley.

* The government approved the Digital Israel plan in the framework of which, fiber optic cables will be installed throughout the country.

* Daylight savings time was extended, saving the economy approximately NIS 300 million per annum.

* The Open Skies reform has led to a 66% increase in low-cost flights.

* Free dental treatment for children under 12: As of today, over 3 million free dental treatments have been given.
