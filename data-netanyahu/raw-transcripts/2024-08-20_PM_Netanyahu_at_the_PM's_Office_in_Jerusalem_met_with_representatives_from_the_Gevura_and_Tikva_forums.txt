Prime Minister thanked the representatives who sought to support him in the face of various pressures and promised them that their loved ones have not fallen in vain, and that Israel will continue to fight until total victory is achieved over Hamas.

Prime Minister Netanyahu at the start of the meeting :

"The first thing is to eliminate Hamas and achieve victory. We are approaching this step by step. If, three months ago, before we went into Rafah, they said there is nothing that can be done â€“ there is a lot to do. In the meantime, we have eliminated Deif and other commanders as well. We seized the Philadelphi Corridor and the Rafah Crossing. We are using all necessary force to dismantle Hamas's rule and its military capability, and this is moving forward.

The second thing is that we are, at the same time, making an effort to return the hostages, on terms that will allow for the maximum number of hostages being released in the first stage of the deal. I say this clearly: This is an objective that I have set. However, the other thing is to preserve our strategic security assets in the face of major domestic and foreign pressure, and we are doing so."

The Prime Minister's Chief-of-Staff, the Deputy Director of the National Security Council, the Cabinet Secretary, the Coordinator for the Hostages and the Missing and the Prime Minister's Spokesperson also attended the meeting.
