Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this morning at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting, made the following remarks:

"This has been a difficult morning; three Israelis were murdered by a depraved individual. On behalf of the entire Cabinet and the entire nation, I send condolences to the families of the victims. Of course, we express our best wishes for the quick recovery of the community security coordinator, who was wounded.

While we are still investigating the event and its implications, we can say some things with certainty even now. One – the home of the terrorist will be demolished. Two – the IDF has already cordoned off the village. Three – all work permits for members of the terrorist's extended family are hereby revoked.

This murderous attack is the result of – inter alia – systematic incitement by the Palestinian Authority and other elements and I expect Abu Mazen to condemn it and not attempt to justify it.

The security forces will continue to take action against incitement and terrorism as they have been doing night and day and we, of course, will finish the investigation of the incident and will discuss together the next steps."
