At the personal invitation of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attended the digital conference of the International Solar Alliance, a new international organization that was founded by India in order to promote solar-based renewable energy.

In his remarks, Prime Minister Netanyahu said that the sun is the almost exclusive source of renewable energy in Israel. Approximately 10% of Israel's energy consumption originates in solar energy. He noted that by 2030, solar energy would constitute over 25% of Israel's energy supply and added that the obstacle of conserving solar energy would have to be overcome in order to provide this energy when there is no sun. Prime Minister Netanyahu said that today hundreds of Israeli start-up companies were active in this field and added that billions of dollars were invested in them.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said:

"We want a future with less carbon and less pollution, a future based on green energy and that's why I welcome this vital initiative by Prime Minister Modi and I want to assure you that Israel is your partner in this quest.

I believe that the most important renewable energy is ingenuity and innovation. And all the countries represented here, beginning with India and Israel, and all of you, are committed to seizing innovation in order to seize the future. And on that I think we can all be very, very hopeful."

Also participating in the conference were Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and ministers from India, Denmark and Great Britain.
