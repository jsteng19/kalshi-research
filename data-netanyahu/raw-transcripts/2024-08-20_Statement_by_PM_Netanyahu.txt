Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this morning:

"Overnight our forces returned the bodies of six of our hostages that had been held by the murderous Hamas terrorist organization: Avraham Munder, Alex Dancyg, Chaim Peri, Yagev Buchshtav, Yoram Metzger and Nadav Popplewell – of blessed memory.

Our hearts grieve over the terrible loss. My wife Sara and I convey our heartfelt condolences to the dear families.

I would like to thank the brave IDF and ISA fighters and commanders for their heroism and determined action.

The State of Israel will continue to make every effort to return all of our hostages – the living and the deceased."
