Pursuant to Prime Minister Netanyahu's directive, the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) has worked to advance the rapid distribution throughout the country of approximately 4,000 computer kits, as per the mapping carried out by local authorities' education and social services teams.

The kits include a tabletop computer, access to the internet for one year, a computer proficiency course, and support and a three-year warranty at the family home.

As a result of the coronavirus and the need for remote learning, special efforts are currently being made in conjunction with the Education Ministry to locate additional pupils that need assistance in order to become involved in the remote learning process. To this end efforts are also being made with the business sector in order to expand the resources of the project.

The "Computer for Every Child" project is administered jointly by the PMO, the National Association for Social Development and local authorities.
