Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, visited the area in Rishon LeZion, which has been struck by missiles, together with Rishon LeZion Mayor Raz Kinstlich, and spoke with the owners of the homes that have been damaged by Iranian missile fire.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"We are making a great effort, first of all, to generously help however we can. The most important thing is to quickly cut through the bureaucracy, and that we should proudly rebuild here.

I want to tell you more than that. I see our mayors, our residents and our citizens, whom the State of Israel can be proud of and who are a credit among the nations. There truly is amazing work here and I am truly proud of our citizens and our people."
