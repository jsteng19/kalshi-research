Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, at the IDF induction base at Tel Hashomer, met with Border Police and IDF Paratroop Brigade recruits and spoke with them ahead of their induction.

Prime Minister Netanyahu told the recruits:

"We are conducting difficult fronts â€“ both in the south and the north. In the end the task of defending the borders of the state and the state itself falls on you. We trust you, we believe in you."

You will undergo difficult and important training that will give you tools to defend yourselves and also the country and this is what I wish you. Defend the state and watch yourselves. Always look out for each other; each one of you also defends the other. I know that you will leave here different men, much stronger than you think, with a genuine contribution to ensuring the future of the State of Israel and this is a great mission. A great mission and I also want to say that you have a great privilege."

In response to the recruits' question about the situation in Gaza, Prime Minister Netanyahu said:

"We are in a campaign. This entails an exchange of blows but in the end it is a test of willpower. We are exhausting every possibility but we are very, very determined to defend our borders. We will do what is necessary to maintain our security, not just for the communities in the area adjacent to the Gaza Strip but for the State of Israel."

After the meeting, the Prime Minister, along with GOC Personnel Maj.-Gen. Motti Almoz, accompanied two recruits as they were processed.
