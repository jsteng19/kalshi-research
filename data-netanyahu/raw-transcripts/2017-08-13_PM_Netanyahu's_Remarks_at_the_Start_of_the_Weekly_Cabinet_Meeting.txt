Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting, made the following remarks:

"President Trump will soon send his representatives, Jared Kushner and Jason Greenblatt, for talks in the region including, of course, in Jerusalem, in an effort to advance the peace process. Of course, we will welcome them as always.

In two days Meir Ben-Shabbat – who is with us here – will begin serving as head of the National Security Council (NSC). Meir has rich experience in defending the security of Israel, in the Israel Security Agency, including his recent post as head of the southern district, and he carried out all of his duties with distinction. He is also familiar to members of the Security Cabinet who are already well acquainted with the clarity of his thinking. We welcome him.

I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Eitan Ben-David who has acceded to my request to stay on at the NSC, and has done – and will continue to do – outstanding work. We commend him and thank him and we will, of course, continue to work together.

We have recently been informed that the injured pilot is recovering and is apparently out of danger. On behalf of all ministers and all Israelis, we wish him a rapid and full recovery."
