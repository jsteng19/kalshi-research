Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with US Senator-elect Joni Ernst (R-IA) and said at the start of their meeting:

"The friendship of the people of the United States of America stands in sharp contrast with what we see unfortunately in Europe. Today we witnessed staggering examples of European hypocrisy. In Geneva they call for the investigation of Israel for war crimes, while in Luxemburg the European court removed Hamas from the list of terrorist organizations, Hamas that has committed countless war crimes and countless terror acts. It seems that too many in Europe, on whose soil six million Jews were slaughtered, have learned nothing. But we in Israel, we've learned. We'll continue to defend our people and our state against the forces of terror and tyranny and hypocrisy."
