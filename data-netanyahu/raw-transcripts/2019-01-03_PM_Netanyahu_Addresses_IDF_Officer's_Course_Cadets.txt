Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, at Bar-Ilan University, at a seminar in memory of the late Lt.-Col. Emanuel Moreno, addressed approximately 650 IDF officer's course cadets. Following is an excerpt from the Prime Minister's remarks:

"You will now be commanders in the army of a country that is surrounded by enemies on several fronts. We are acting decisively to thwart all those who seek to endanger us.

This is now happening in Syria, against Iran's attempts to entrench itself militarily in Syria. It is also happening on the Lebanese border. We are denying Hezbollah the weapon of terrorist tunnels which it had prepared in order to attack us. It prepared a stratagem here, and by a stratagem we shattered its main surprise weapon for use at the start of the war, according to its planning, just like we denied Hamas in the Gaza Strip the tunnels weapon.

The greatest threat from Iran is that of nuclear weapons in the hands of a power which declares that we need to be wiped off the face of the earth. Here as well we are fighting, and on occasion I have been obliged to fight before all the leaders of the world against what I see as an existential danger and to fight it in time. I strongly opposed the nuclear agreement that was signed with Iran, which paved Iran's way to a nuclear arsenal â€“ not one bomb but hundreds of bombs. This is the agreement that 'in exchange' filled the coffers of this regime with vast sums, which it immediately channeled to their regional aggression. I insisted on the reimposition of sanctions on Iran and President Trump indeed made the brave decision to reimpose them. President Trump is acting against Iran in the economic sphere and here in Israel we are acting against Iran in the military sphere."
