In recent weeks, I and several world leaders have made serious efforts to advance peace.

If President Abbas moves to implement what was signed today in Doha, he will abandon the path of peace and join forces with the enemies of peace.

Hamas is an enemy of peace. It's an Iranian backed terror organization committed to Israel's destruction. It has not accepted the minimal conditions set by the international community:

• It refuses to recognize Israel's right to exist.

• It refuses to honor the signed agreements between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.

• It refuses to abandon terrorism.

Indeed, it continues to arm itself for even deadlier terrorism.

President Abbas, you can't have it both ways. It's either a pact with Hamas or peace with Israel. It's one or the other. You can't have them both.
