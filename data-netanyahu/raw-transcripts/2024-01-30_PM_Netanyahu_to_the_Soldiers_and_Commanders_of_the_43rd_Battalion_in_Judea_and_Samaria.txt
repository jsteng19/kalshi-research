Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the Soldiers and Commanders of the 43rd Battalion in Judea and Samaria: "This sector is no less important, it is super-important. Five hundred terrorists have been eliminated here, and we are not finished, including in Jenin today."

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, met with reserve soldiers and commanders of the IDF Judea and Samaria Division, 43rd Battalion, in the Binyamin Brigade, in the community of Eli.

Battalion Commander Lt.-Col. Idan Suissa briefed the Prime Minister on their activity in the sector and their quick reporting for duty, in the Binyamin area, on the morning of October 7.

Prime Minister Netanyahu to the fighters:

"We are in a battle in which we will not compromise over total victory. We must achieve total victory. In order to do so, we must deal with other sectors, and this sector is no less important, it is super-important. I know that you are investing in this on both defense and offense. It seems to be that since the start of the year, especially – of course – since the start of the war, 500 terrorists have been eliminated here, and we are not finished, including in Jenin today.

I would like to thank you for your effort, and I would like to tell you something else: I know, first of all, that you are carrying the burden, and I request that employers take this into consideration and not fire reservists, which would be terrible. If any of you are students, I also want you to know that I have met with the heads of the universities and I will meet with them again, so that they will ease conditions. Yours is a sacred task.

I would also like to tell you that the citizens of Israel, everyone, myself included, salute you. Continuing doing the work. Thank you very much."
