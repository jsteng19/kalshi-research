Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with Public Security Minister Yitzhak Aharonovitch in wake of the assault on an IDF officer who went to visit his soldiers in the Jerusalem neighborhood of Mea Shearim.

The Prime Minister was updated on the efforts of the Israel Police to apprehend the assailants. "This is outrageous. The offenders who raised their hands against an IDF officer must be dealt with to the fullest extent of the law. IDF service is a source of pride. The IDF is the people's army and protects everyone. All population groups in Israeli society serve in its ranks; this is how it has been and how it will continue," the Prime Minister said.
