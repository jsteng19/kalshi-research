Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem, met with representatives of the hostages' families and told them: "Contrary to what is being said â€“ there is no genuine proposal by Hamas, this is not true. I will say this as clearly as I can because there are so many incorrect items that are certainly causing you pain. On the other hand, there is our initiative, which I will not detail."
