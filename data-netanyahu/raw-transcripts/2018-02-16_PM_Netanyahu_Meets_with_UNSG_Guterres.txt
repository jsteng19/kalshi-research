Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the Munich Security Conference, met with United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres and told him that the Golan Heights would remain in Israel's hands forever. The Prime Minister said that Israel would not allow Iran to establish a military presence in Syria and added that Israel would act against any Iranian attempt to build bases in Syria.

Prime Minister Netanyahu thanked UNSG Guterres for holding an informal UN Security Council discussion on the IDF fallen and Israeli civilians being held by Hamas and said that there must be additional determined action on this issue.
