Dear Bereaved Families,

As the son of a bereaved family, I am very familiar with your pain, a pain that accompanies the family members every day, and is not limited to one specific day or event. On this day, the Memorial Day for the IDF Fallen and the Victims of Terror, the entire State of Israel bows its head with you and to you; it salutes the dead and embraces them.

The entire nation stands with you today, bereaved families, and with you remembers and commemorates the sons and daughters, the fathers and mothers, the brothers and sisters who are gone.

Sadly, this year as well our sons have fallen, and again parents, wives, siblings and children have been added to the family of bereavement, all stunned by pain.

Our hand is extended in peace, but as long as there are those who rise against us, we will not be afraid nor will we be deterred from grasping a weapon and protecting the borders of the land and its citizens and ensuring their lives and well-being. We yearn for peace but also know that we must continue to defend the country and its citizens. By doing these two things, we are upholding the will of the fallen.

May their memories be blessed.
