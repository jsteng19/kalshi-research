Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today, at the weekly Cabinet meeting, made the following remarks after Home Front Defense Minister Matan Vilnai's review:

"You did major work in the field and more work is yet necessary. The most important thing is the national strength of the State of Israel. It rests on four foundations: Active defense, passive defense, deterrence and punishment. These are the elements that comprise our national strength and everything is being done in these fields in order to protect the population. Active defense is focused on existing technologies and we need to continue developing active defense.

Passive defense is the protection of the population in open spaces, especially the strengthening and protecting of cities in the older areas. This is not enough; against ever developing and more precise weapons, an active preparation is called for and, to this end, we must continue to develop and strengthen the elements of deterrence and punishment."

At the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting

, Prime Minister Netanyahu said, "This is part of our ongoing activity in recent years to prepare Israel for a new era that we all recognize, an era of threats to the Israeli home front. I know that great efforts have been made and are yet to be made."
