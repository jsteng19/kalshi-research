Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with Greek President Prokopis Pavlopoulos.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"I welcome your arrival and am pleased at the strong ties between our countries. We have common values. We are two democracies and I am pleased at the continuity in our good relations. I very much believe in the cooperation between our countries, which we will expand in a range of areas: Energy, tourism, knowledge, innovation and others.

The Arab states understand that Israel is not an enemy but an ally against Iran and Daesh. There is great importance to the strategic role that Israel is fulfilling in the region. Israel contributes to stability in the Middle East. A strong Israel prevents the passage of masses of refugees to Europe. The world would be different if we were not here."

Greek President Pavlopoulos:

"I would like to thank you for the assistance and cooperation between our countries. Israel is a western democracy. We feel close to Israel and see you as allies. The terrorists represent barbarism. Only together will everyone be able to resolve the refugee problem and not each country on its own. We are pleased and grateful at the bilateral G2G cooperation and I would like to positively note the cooperation with Cyprus. The two peoples will be able to continue working for Europe and the region. As prime minister you have an important role in these relations."
