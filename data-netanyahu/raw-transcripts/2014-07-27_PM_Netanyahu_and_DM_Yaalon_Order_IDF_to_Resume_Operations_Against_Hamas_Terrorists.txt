Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon, have ordered the IDF to resume operations against the Hamas terrorists who violated the humanitarian truce which the UN requested for the residents of Gaza. Yet again Hamas is cynically exploiting the residents of Gaza in order to use them as human shields. Hamas first rejected the Egyptian ceasefire initiative and afterwards violated last week's UN humanitarian truce. It later violated the Red Cross humanitarian truce and has rebuffed the UN request for a humanitarian truce in order to allow the residents of Gaza to prepare for Eid al-Fitr.

The IDF targets terrorist centers but if residents are inadvertently hit, it is Hamas which is responsible given that it has – again – violated the humanitarian truce that Israel acceded to.
