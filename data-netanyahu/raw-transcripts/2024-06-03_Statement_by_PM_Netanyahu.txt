Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today:

"We are working in countless ways to return our hostages.

I think about them constantly, about their families and about their suffering.

Therefore, we have gone a long way to return them while adhering to the objectives of the war, first and foremost the elimination of Hamas.

We are insistent that we will achieve both. This is part of the outline, not something that I have just added. It is not something that I have added because of coalition pressure. This is something that we agreed on in the War Cabinet unanimously."
