Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today :

"My brothers and sisters, dear citizens of Israel, on this day we are all united, in grief that is too heavy to bear.

Today, every home in Israel bows its head. We bow our heads over the heavy loss of four of our hostages. We all feel pain mixed with rage. We are all outraged at the Hamas monsters.

The four coffins of our dear ones require us, more than ever, to ensure, to swear, that what happened on October 7 never recurs.

The voice of our dear ones' blood cries out to us from the ground. It requires us to settle accounts with the depraved murderers â€“ and we will settle accounts with them.

'G-d of vengeance, Lord G-d of vengeance, appear' [Psalms 94:1]

Our heart may be broken but our spirit is not. And with this spirit: We will return all of our hostages. We will destroy the murderers; we will eliminate Hamas. And together, with G-d's help, we will ensure our future."
