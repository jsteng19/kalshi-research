“I was saddened to hear about the passing of Yehuda Wachsman, the father of IDF soldier Nachson Wachsman, who was kidnapped and murdered by terrorists in 1994. Yehuda chose life. He educated and taught values, Torah and love of the people and the land. For myself, my wife Sara and all citizens of Israel, I send condolences to Esther and the children. May his memory be blessed.”
