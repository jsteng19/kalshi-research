Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with ISA Director Yoram Cohen and instructed him to conduct a full and speedy investigation of this morning’s arson attack.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said, “This morning’s outrageous arson attack on a church is an attack on us all. In Israel freedom of worship is one of our core values and is guaranteed under the law. Those responsible for this despicable crime will face the full force of the law. Hate and intolerance have no place in our society.”
