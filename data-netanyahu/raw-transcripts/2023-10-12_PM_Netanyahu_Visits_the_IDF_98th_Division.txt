Lions! People and lions. They experienced the most difficult ordeal, left everything at home, came here, parked here on the road, kilometers, geared up, went into the field, fought like lions against indescribable horrors and continued to fight, fell, got up, and the spirit I met here is incredible.I sat here with the senior commanders and now here with the soldiers and commanders. 'Mr. Prime Minister, give us freedom of action.' This is what they are saying. 'Give us the freedom to act. We will crush them and we will ensure the future of the State of Israel. You have the best here, the best.' You are genuine heroes.I salute you, each one of you, I salute you. Know that the entire people of Israel stands behind you. This is no empty phrase. The people of Israel stand behind you, relies on you and together we will win. Today, after you visit here, you will know how true this is and how correct, and you will know that this is what will be. Thank you all, thank you."
