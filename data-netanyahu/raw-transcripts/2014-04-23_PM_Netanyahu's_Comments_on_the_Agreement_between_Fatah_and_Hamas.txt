Following are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's comments on the agreement between Fatah and Hamas:

"I said this morning that Abu Mazen needs to choose between peace with Israel and an agreement with Hamas, a murderous terrorist organization that calls for the destruction of the State of Israel and which both the United States and the European Union define as a terrorist organization.

This evening, as talks are still ongoing about extending the negotiations, Abu Mazen has chosen Hamas and not peace.

Whoever chooses Hamas does not want peace."
