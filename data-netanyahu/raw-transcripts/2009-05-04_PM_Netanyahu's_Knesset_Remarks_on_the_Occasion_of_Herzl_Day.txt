Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today addressed the Knesset on the occasion of Herzl Day, and said the following:

"Whoever does not recognize the Jewish People's right to self-determination and to a national state is selling out his own. Whoever does not feel – and does not respect – the Jewish people's deep connection to its Land, does not really respect the Jewish People's legitimate rights; therefore, recognition of the State of Israel as the national state of the Jewish People is a necessary basis for a true peace between us and our Palestinian neighbors."
