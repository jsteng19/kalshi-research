At the behest of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon, Prime Minister's Office Director General Ronen Peretz, Finance Ministry Director General Shai Babad and Social Equality Ministry Director General Avi Cohen have formulated an outline for allocating grants to discharged lone soldiers.

Lone soldiers who have been discharged from the IDF in the past year, and who have integrated into the labor force, will receive grants of up to NIS 4,000.

In the framework of the expanded economic plan that will be submitted for Cabinet approval in the coming days, the discharged soldiers will also be able to withdraw part of their military deposit for any purpose (the deposit fund is limited to the first five years after discharge and is designed for certain purposes only).
