At a discussion held between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Communications Minister Ayoob Kara, Culture and Sports Minister Miri Regev, Tourism Minister Yariv Levin and Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit, the Prime Minister made it clear that the government would act in accordance with European Broadcasting Union rules.

However, there are open legal issues regarding the Eurovision stemming from matters of pending legislation that are yet before the courts. The Prime Minister instructed that the legal aspects of the matter be examined with the relevant officials before a decision is made.
