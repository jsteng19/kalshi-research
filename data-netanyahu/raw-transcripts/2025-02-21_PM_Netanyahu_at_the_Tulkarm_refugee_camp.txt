"We are entering the strongholds of terrorism, leveling entire streets and eliminating terrorists. I have instructed to augment the forces in Judea and Samaria and to launch additional operations".

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today (Friday) went to the Tulkarm refugee camp, where he received a security briefing from the Commander of the Judea and Samaria division, Brig.-Gen. Yaki Dolf, Head of the Civil Administration, Brig.-Gen. Hisham Ibrahim, and the Commander of the Efraim Territorial Brigade.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu:

"Just before the start of Shabbat, I have arrived here, at the Tulkarm refugee camp, to be with our heroic soldiers. They are doing a tremendous job.

In the past year we have greatly increased our activity. We are entering the strongholds of terrorism, leveling entire streets used by terrorists, and their homes, as well as eliminating terrorists and commanders. We are taking extremely important measures, against Hamas and other terrorist entities who are attempting to harm us.

This desire has not yet ceased. What we have witnessed yesterday - an attempt to perpetrate a series of terrorist attacks with mass casualties - is a very severe situation.

In response, we have augmented the forces in Judea and Samaria, in accordance with my directive and that of the Minister of Defense. I have also instructed to launch additional operations against hotbeds of terrorism.

I know that our heroic soldiers know how to do this job well"
