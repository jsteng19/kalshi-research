Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expresses deep sorrow on the passing of former MK and Deputy Minister

Rabbi Menachem Porush

The late Rabbi Porush was a pillar of the ultra-orthodox public in Israel and represented it loyally and with a great sense of mission. He was one of the Knesset's most veteran members and served in it continuously from the 4th through the 13th Knessets, as an MK for Agudat Yisrael and United Torah Judaism.

A warm and personal relationship existed between Prime Minister Netanyahu and Rabbi Porush, who had been acquainted with the former's grandfather. The Prime Minister consulted with Rabbi Porush many times and benefitted from his wisdom and experience.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said: "The Jewish People have lost a dear, wise and warm man who loved his People and was among its most dedicated public servants. We mourn his passing."
