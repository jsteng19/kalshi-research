Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today:

"To Hannah and Gadi Eisenkot,

Sara and I are broken-hearted over your son Gal's fall in battle.

We weep with you and we embrace you.

Gal was a brave soldier and a true hero.

We send our heartfelt condolences to your family and to the families of all of our fallen heroes.

The people embrace you with love, appreciation and gratitude â€“ today and always.

How great is the pain. How deep is the sorrow.

The Government and citizens of Israel mourn together with you.

Our heroes have not fallen in vain. We will continue to fight until victory."
