Prime Minister Netanyahu, for the first time, underwent a rapid coronavirus 'Sofia' test and tested negative for the coronavirus. Earlier today, Prime Minister Netanyahu and Deputy Health Minister Yoav Kisch toured the Neveh Horim retirement home in Jerusalem, which today, for the first time, implemented the 'Sofia' testing system – which was acquired for extensive use in Israel pursuant to discussions that the Prime Minister chaired on the issue and following a series of Health Ministry checks – into its activity. Prime Minister Netanyahu: "We have preliminary signs of cautious optimism that we are blocking the pandemic; however, it is too early to say this. All of the experts, without exception, have said – wait at least another week. This is what we are doing. But when we exit in a gradual and responsible manner, this time in the second wave, I will also ask that rapid testing be used." Today, in retirement homes throughout Israel, we are installing the 'Sofia' rapid test. This test takes 15 minutes. This could also help us with domestic flights, and hotels and in many other fields – in hospitals and clinics. We will make a gradual and responsible exit and we will not capitulate to any populist pressures on this matter." "We are now working with the second wave in a very responsible manner, just as we did in the first wave. In the first wave, we had a unified and united government. And the public responded. In order for us to succeed in the second wave, I need the same thing, a united government and a public that responds to the rules. All of Europe is now galloping toward the second lockdown. If we act correctly, we will exit the second lockdown in a better situation at a time when Europe is entering it. Then please follow the rules and I also call on the members of the government and the coalition, and MKs, to be united."
