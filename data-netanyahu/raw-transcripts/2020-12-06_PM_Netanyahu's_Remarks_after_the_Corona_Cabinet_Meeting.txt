Following are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s remarks after the Corona Cabinet meeting, today:

"The vaccines are on the way; I am working on this around the clock. But until they arrive, and even after they arrive, we must lower the morbidity that is at the start of a third wave. We can lower it; we have proven this. We lowered the morbidity and the mortality to a level that is almost the lowest among the countries of Europe. We did this because we did not hesitate to make the correct decisions at the time. Now as well, I will not hesitate to reimpose some of the restrictions and the earlier we do so – the duration of the restrictions will be shorter. There is light at the end of the pandemic here. We need to work together, bring the vaccines and impose the restrictions so that we lower morbidity, and we will come out of this."
