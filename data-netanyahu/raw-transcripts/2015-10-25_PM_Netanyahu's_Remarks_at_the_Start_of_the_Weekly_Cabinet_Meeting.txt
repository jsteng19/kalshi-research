Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made the following remarks at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting:

"I made clear in my talks with Secretary of State John Kerry that there will be no change in the status quo. The Temple Mount will remain as is and will be managed as it is now. Arrangements for visits by Jews to the Temple Mount are safeguarded; there will be no change in them, just as the prayer arrangements for the Muslims.

Israel has an interest in stationing cameras in all parts of the Temple Mount. First, in order to disprove the claim that Israel is changing the status quo. Second, to show where the provocations really come from and to foil them before they ever happen.

I heard the positive response of Jordan's foreign minister to what I said last night. I hope it will help calm things, at least regarding the Temple Mount.

For the sake of removing any doubt, I am advancing the Jewish State bill in coordination with all coalition factions. We will do this in accordance with the coalition agreement which says: "a team consisting of all coalition factions will be established to formulate an agreed upon text for the Jewish State bill - that's exactly what we did, and we will pass this law.

We are constantly fighting Daish, Jabhat - Al Nusra and other terrorist organizations. Yesterday an Israeli civilian crossed our border in the Golan Heights into Syria to join the ranks of the enemy. We will act to nullify his citizenship. That is what is done in any such case. Whoever joins the ranks of the enemy to fight against Israel, will not be an Israeli citizen. "
