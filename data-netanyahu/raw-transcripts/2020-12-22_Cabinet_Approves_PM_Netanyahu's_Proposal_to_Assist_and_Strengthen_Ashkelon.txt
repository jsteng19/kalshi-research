Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"We promised that we would assist Ashkelon and we are doing so. This is gigantic news for the residents of Ashkelon and for the mayor. They are on the front line and need to receive all the assistance they deserve."

The Cabinet, today (Tuesday, 22 December 2020), approved Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's proposal to enact a plan to assist and strengthen the city of Ashkelon. The plan includes over NIS 230 million in assistance in various fields such as – inter alia – improving housing and transportation infrastructures, encouraging innovation and boosting education, and operating resilience centers. Incentives will also be given for urban renewal in older neighborhoods. Assistance will also be provided via technological means such as digital literacy and digitizing the municipality. Ashkelon will be defined as an 'A' national priority area and new factories will be transferred to the city.

The proposal was led by Prime Minister's Office Acting Director General Tzach Braverman together with the Defense, Finance and Economy ministries.
