Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with Simcha and Leah Goldin, the parents of Lt. Hadar Goldin, who fell in combat in the Gaza Strip on Friday, and told them, "Hadar was a tremendous personality, a great hero. I know that you are going through terrible agony, the feeling that a part of you has been taken away and you are no longer whole. This is pain that has no relief, not even for a moment. I hope that you will find consolation in the fact that he fell to uphold the people of Israel in the struggle for our independence."
