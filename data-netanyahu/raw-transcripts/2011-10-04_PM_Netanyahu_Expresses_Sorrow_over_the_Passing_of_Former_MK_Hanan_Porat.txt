Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today, expressed his deep sorrow over the passing of

former MK Hanan Porat

"Hanan Porat dedicated his life to building up the Land of Israel, and to educating generations of students about religious Zionism and loving the Land of Israel and the Jewish People. A son of kibbutz Kfar Etzion,

which was destroyed in the War of Independence, Hanan led the return to the Etzion Bloc after its liberation [in 1967].

His contributions to building up the Land and to its communities, to education and to leading the nation according to Zionist principles, are examples to Israelis. I first met Hanan almost 40 years ago and was immediately impressed by his Zionist fervor and his deep commitment to restoring the Jewish People to its Land. This fervor did not lessen and accompanied him until his last day. His contributions to institutions, individuals and to educating the younger generation will yet be told. I would like to express my condolences to his wife Rachel, to his children and grandchildren and to his friends and students, who will continue his Zionist path."
