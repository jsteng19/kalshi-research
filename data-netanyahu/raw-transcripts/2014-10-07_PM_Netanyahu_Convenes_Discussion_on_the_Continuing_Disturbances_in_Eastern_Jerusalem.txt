Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this afternoon, convened a discussion on the continuing disturbances in eastern Jerusalem. Attending the discussion were Public Security Minister Yitzhak Aharonovitch, Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat, Israel Police Commissioner Yohanan Danino, Jerusalem District Police Commander Yossi Fareinty, ISA Director Yoram Cohen, Attorney General Yehuda Weinstein and State Attorney Shai Nitzan.

Prime Minister Netanyahu instructed that forces be increased in the confrontation areas and that vigorous action be taken against those who disturb the peace, and added that the current situation must not become the norm. The Prime Minister said, "Recently there has been stone-throwing, disturbances and violence. I think that we need to deal with this not just due to the holidays but in a thorough manner. The goal of this meeting is to do just that â€“ to see what forces, what capabilities and what steps are needed in order to ensure peace in Jerusalem."
