Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, chaired a meeting of the Corona Cabinet in order to discuss the necessary steps to continue dealing with the corona pandemic in the immediate term, the use of digital means to block the spread of the pandemic, and to set an outbreak scenario. The participants discussed the proposals formulated by the National Security Council (NSC) pursuant to the forum of director generals that was convened yesterday. It was made clear that the goal of the policy is to significantly slow the pace of morbidity and reduce the mortality risks, with minimal impact on the economy and daily routine. The Cabinet decided upon the following immediate steps: 1. A national enforcement authority will be established, under the aegis of the Public Security Ministry, to direct, guide and coordinate all of the enforcement agencies. 2. Fines will be increased. The fine for not wearing a mask will be raised to NIS 500. 3. Enforcement by municipal inspectors shall be increased. A meeting will be held with the Federation of Local Authorities, with the participation of the Public Security Minister, the Finance Minister, the Interior Minister and the head of the NSC. 4. The list of communities to be declared restricted zones upon the identification of an increase in morbidity (according to the set parameters) will be evaluated forthwith. 5. Protecting at-risk populations â€“ the continuation of checks and protective measures at centers for the elderly. 6. An evaluation, in conjunction with the Civil Service Commissioner, of a return to work in "capsules". 7. School activity during the summer vacation, along with private camps, has been approved.
