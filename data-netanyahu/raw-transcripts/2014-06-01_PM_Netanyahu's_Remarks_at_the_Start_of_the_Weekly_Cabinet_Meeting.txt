Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, made the following remarks at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting:

"I call on all responsible elements in the international community not to run to recognize the Palestinian government of which Hamas is a part and which rests on Hamas. Hamas is a terrorist organization that calls for the destruction of Israel and the international community must not embrace it. This will not strengthen peace; it will strengthen terrorism.

On the upcoming Shavuot holiday we see the first fruits of the Land of Israel. And we see here the first fruits of the Land of Israel. There are children here from the Negev and from Tzuba in the Jerusalem hills. I see here wheat, grapes, fruit from the ground and many other things and of course, we merit to see the children. Shavuot also marks the giving of the Torah and the bringing of the first fruits and we always knew that we have a land flowing with milk and cyber."
