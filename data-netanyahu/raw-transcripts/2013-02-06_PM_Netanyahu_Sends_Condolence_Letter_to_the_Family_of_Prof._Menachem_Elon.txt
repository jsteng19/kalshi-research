Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,send a condolence letter to the family of former Supreme Court Vice President and Israel Prize laureate Prof. Menachem Elon, who passed away last night.

Prime Minister Netanyahu wrote (inter alia): "I remember very well my meetings with him over the years. His personality, his warmth, his wisdom and his love for his people and his family were apparent in his words and deeds.

Menachem was a proud Jew and an enthusiastic Zionist. As a student of the Torah and possessing a broad education, he dedicated his life in an effort to combine Jewish civil law and the legal systems in use in Israel.

Menachem was both well-versed in Jewish law and a profound humanist. His love for the state and his commitment to justice were part of his religious-Zionist worldview. He was esteemed and loved by all. As Supreme Court Vice President, he blazed paths in the legal system. His monumental work on Jewish civil law is one of the fundamental works on Hebrew jurisprudence.

Thanks to him, Jewish civil law has a special place in our legal system."
