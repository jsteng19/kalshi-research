Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today, in his office, hosted Ironi Kiryat Shemona football team’s players, its coach Ran Ben Shimon, and owner Izzie Sheratzky on the occasion of the team’s historic winning of the Israeli Premier League Championship.

Prime Minister Netanyahu received from the players a team jersey and autographed ball, and gave them a gift of his own – a cake in the form of a football field with the dedication “Kiryat Shemona in the League of Champions.”

Prime Minister Netanyahu told the players, “Simply put, you moved me. You played extraordinary football, not just for one game but in all the games. You put your souls into it and that is why you won not only the championship but also the hearts of every Israeli, from north to south. You have proven a simple thing – whoever believes, can. You proved this in the most marvelous way possible. I am waiting to take the highway to the stadium in Kiryat Shmona.”

Culture and Sports Minister Limor Livnat and Kiryat Shemona Mayor Nissim Malka also attended the meeting.
