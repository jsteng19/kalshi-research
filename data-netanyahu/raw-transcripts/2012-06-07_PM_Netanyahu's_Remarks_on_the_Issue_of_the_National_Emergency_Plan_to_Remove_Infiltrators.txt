Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made the following remarks today following a discussion that was held on the issue of illegal infiltrators. Interior Minister Eli Yishai, Public Security Minister Yitzhak Aharonovich and Justice Minister Yaakov Neeman, as well as IDF, Israel Police and Prison Service representatives, attended the discussion.

"I held an additional discussion – along with the Interior Minister, the Public Security Minister and the Justice Minister, as well as with professional elements – in the framework of the national emergency plan to remove infiltrators. This is a serious problem and we are dealing with it.

First, we will complete the fence as quickly as possible and deal with infiltrations until the fence is completed. Second, we will build detention facilities including thousands of units. Third, we will move infiltrators directly from the border to the facilities. We needed to make several changes and we made them. Fourth, we will punish those who illegally employ infiltrators. Next week will be the second and third Knesset readings of a law that will deal severely with such employers, and allow their businesses to be closed.

At the same time, the Interior Minister is preparing to issues orders that will allow for the detention of the infiltrators. This is still partial but it is a start. The Public Security Minister will detain infiltrator criminals in the Tel Aviv area and put them in prison, and this will be done in addition to the continued deployment of a Border Police unit in southern Tel Aviv.

I believe that these and other measures, which I will not detail here, will begin to reverse the trend and we will solve it."
