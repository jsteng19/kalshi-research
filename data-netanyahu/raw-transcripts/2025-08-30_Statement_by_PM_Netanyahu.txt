Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening:

"In a special operation carried out by the IDF and the ISA in the Gaza Strip, the body of Idan Shtivi was returned. Following the completion of the identification process at the Institute of Forensic Medicine, his return to Israel was permitted for publication.

Idan was a student in sustainability and government and a brave person: On 7 October 2023, he participated in the Nova festival. When the terrorist attack began, he acted to save many fellow participants and help them escape, and was murdered in the process. His body was abducted to Gaza by the Hamas terrorist organization.

Together with the entire people of Israel, my wife and I send our heartfelt condolences to the Shtivi family.

I reiterate my appreciation for the IDF and ISA for their determined and daring action.

As of now, 207 hostages – 148 of them alive – have been returned to Israel.

We will continue to take relentless and determined action, in various ways, to bring back all of our hostages, the living and the deceased."
