Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today at the signing of the coalition agreements, also made the following remarks in English:

"My government remains committed to pursuing peace with the Palestinians, pursuing peace with all our neighbors. My policy has not changed. We'll continue to pursue every avenue for peace while ensuring the safety and security of our citizens. I believe the developments in the region have created new challenges for us all. But I also believe that they've created new opportunities for peace, and I intend to seize those opportunities. A broader government, a more stable government, will make it easier to do so."
