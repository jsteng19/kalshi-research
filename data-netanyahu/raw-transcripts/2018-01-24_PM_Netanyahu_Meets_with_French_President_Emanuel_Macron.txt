PM Netanyahu Meets with French President Emanuel Macron

PM Netanyahu in Davos, met with French President Emanuel Macron and told him, "The partnership between us is also important for the security of Europe."

The two discussed at length the need to stand against Iran's regional aggression.

PM Netanyahu expressed his view that the nuclear agreement cannot be left as is since it would – within several years – lead to Iran's going nuclear with an arsenal of nuclear weapons. The Prime Minister made it clear that Israel is committed to preventing this nuclearization and expressed his opinion that the failures of the agreement needed to be dealt with.
