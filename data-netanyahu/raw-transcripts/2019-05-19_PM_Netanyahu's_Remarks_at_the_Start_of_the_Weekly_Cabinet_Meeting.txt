Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this morning, at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting, made the following remarks: "Like many of the people and also around the world, last night I watched Kobi Marimi's impressive performance. Kobi, I want to tell you that you moved us very much with your emotion. You represented us with honor and we all embrace you. On this matter, a few weeks ago the Dutch Prime Minister, my friend Mark Rutte, called me. He congratulated me on my election victory and also told me 'Good, in a few weeks, you will call me and congratulate me on the Netherlands' victory in the Eurovision.' I do not know how he knew but he was right. So, congratulations to you Mark, congratulations to the Netherlands, and next year in Amsterdam. From here I also send congratulations to another friend of mine, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who won the elections after the polls consistently predicted that he would lose. At the last minute, in the final hours, he won. He defined this is a miracle. Then Scott, congratulations, 'and I do not know what you are saying.' Regarding the coalition, I regret that the parties are still in the treetops. I hope that a way will be found soon to bring them down to the ground of reality so that together we can form a strong and stable government for the State of Israel that will continue to lead the country to new heights."
