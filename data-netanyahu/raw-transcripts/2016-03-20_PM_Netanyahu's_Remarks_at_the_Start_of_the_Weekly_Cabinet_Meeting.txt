Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made the following remarks at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting:

"I would like to send condolences to the families of those who were murdered in Turkey and wishes for recovery to the wounded. An air force plane with an IDF delegation left for Istanbul this morning to bring the wounded, and the coffins of the murdered, back to Israel.

I would like to commend the Foreign Ministry personnel for their dedicated and professional work in both Istanbul and Jerusalem.

Terrorism sows death around the world. Israel is at the forefront of the fight against global terrorism. This struggle is first of all military, but no less is it a moral struggle. The key to the moral fight against terrorism is to make it clear that terrorism, the murder of innocents, has no justification anywhere â€“ not in Istanbul or the Ivory Coast or Jerusalem. Whoever does not condemn terrorism, supports terrorism.

It is the IDF and the security forces who are leading the military struggle against terrorism. While attempts to disparage IDF soldiers are wrong in their own right, attempts to gather intelligence about them are completely unacceptable and will be dealt with by the responsible authorities.

Today, the Cabinet will approve a reform that will provide incentives to single mothers to go out and work, to work more hours and to receive higher wages. The Government is committed to reducing gaps and this is one of the important steps to this end. I commend Social Affairs and Social Services Minister Chaim Katz for this important social move whose time has come."
