Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem, met with IDF widows and orphans, who have lost the father of the family during the Swords of Iron War.

The Prime Minister heard from the widows and orphans about their fathers and husbands – dedicated and loving family men – who have fallen. He also listened to the stories of their heroism during the events of October 7 and in the fighting in the Gaza Strip.

Prime Minister Netanyahu embraced the family members and shared in their pain, and said that their loved ones fell in defense of the homeland. He added that the testament of the fallen is to complete the mission until total victory over Hamas, an objective that Israel will not shrink from.

The Prime Minister, together with the members of the family of the late Sgt.-Maj. Yossi Hershkovitz, watched a video clip that he sent to them from the Gaza Strip before he fell, in which he said, "I glad to take part together with you – you are an inseparable part of me."

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"There are stories of great heroism here. What Shlomi said is true. It is not just thousands of people; it is the State of Israel that owes them its existence. This is neither a phrase nor mere words.

What Yossi asked for is to fight, to take the war to the enemy, to win. We have this, we will also do this."

IDF Widows and Orphans Organization CEO Shlomi Nahumson:

"When you go around the streets of Jerusalem, the south, in Tel Aviv, you look left and right and you see the people, who are alive today, and they are going to work, and they are going to school and to kindergarten, and they are maintaining their daily routine, thanks to your fathers."

The Prime Minister's Military Secretary, Maj.-Gen. Avi Gil and IDF Widows and Orphans Organization Chairperson Tami Shelach also participated in the meeting.
