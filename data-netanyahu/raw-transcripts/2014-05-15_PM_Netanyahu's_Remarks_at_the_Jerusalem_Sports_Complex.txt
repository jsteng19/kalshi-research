Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made the following remarks while touring the sports complex being built in Jerusalem:

"Today, not far from here, in the Palestinian Authority, they are marking what they call Nakba Day. They stand silent in order to commemorate the disaster of the establishment of Israel, the state of the Jewish People. They educate their children, with endless propaganda, that the State of Israel needs to disappear. We have many responses to this. The first response is that we are continuing to build up our state and our united capital, Jerusalem. We will also give another response to the Nakba: We will pass the nationality law that makes it clear to the entire world that Israel is the state of the Jewish People. "
