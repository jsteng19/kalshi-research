Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening:

"Since the start of the war, I have been leading a diplomatic campaign to block pressure designed to end the war prematurely, and to secure strong support for Israel.

We have had considerable success. Today, a Harvard CAPS -Harris poll (https://harvardharrispoll.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/HHP_Feb2024_KeyResults.pdf) was published, which shows that 82% of the American public supports Israel, meaning that four out of five US citizens supports Israel and not Hamas.

This will help us continue the campaign until total victory."
