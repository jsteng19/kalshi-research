Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today , visited Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) where Chairman of the Board Amir Peretz and President and CEO Boaz Levy briefed him on the company's activity. The Prime Minister also toured an exhibit of advanced defensive and offensive means and capabilities.

Prime Minister Netanyahu [translated from Hebrew]:

"I am here at IAI and am very impressed by the defensive and offensive means that we are developing here.

We are determined to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. Our vigorous opposition to returning to the original nuclear agreement contributed to the American decision not to do so. We have also made it clear to our American friends that more limited agreements are also unacceptable to us.

In any case, just as I have clarified to them and to the world, I will reiterate here: We will do whatever we need to do in order to defend ourselves, with our own forces, against any threat."

Also participating in the visit were National Security Council Director Tzachi Hanegbi, the Prime Minister's Chief of Staff Tzachi Braverman and the Prime Minister's Military Secretary Maj.-Gen. Avi Gil.
