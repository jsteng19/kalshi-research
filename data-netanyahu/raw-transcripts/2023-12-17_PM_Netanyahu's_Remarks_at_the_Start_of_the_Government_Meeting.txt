Following are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks at the start of the Government meeting at the Kirya in Tel Aviv, today: "Today the Government will receive s security briefing. I would first like to read a letter that I received this morning from dozens of families of our fallen heroes. They write: 'The people are strong, with a steadfast spirit. The heroic civilians and soldiers are determined to reach absolute victory. You have a mandate to fight; you do not have a mandate to stop in the middle. This is the testament of the fallen and it is our obligation to the living.' I would like to respond to the dear families: The testament of the fallen is what guides us. We will fight to the end. We will achieve all of our goals: eliminating Hamas, releasing all of our hostages and ensuring that Gaza does not again become a focus of terrorism, incitement and attacks against the State of Israel. We will continue to fight until the end on behalf of the fallen and to ensure our lives here in the Land of Israel."
