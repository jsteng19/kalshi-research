Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today received from Education Minister Gideon Saar an update on

National Authority for Measurement and Evaluation in Education data that attest to a decline in the scope of violence in the educational system in 2009-2011

and on the steps being taken to ensure that this trend continues.

Prime Minister Netanyahu commended Education Minister Saar on the improvement in the data and noted that this is an inseparable part of the revolution that the current government is carrying out in the education system, from kindergartens to the universities. The Prime Minister said, "In addition to the resources that we are investing in improving conditions for teachers and pupils, we will continue to take action so that schools will be a safe place for pupils."
