Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this morning made the following remarks at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting:

"Several years ago, during the massive Carmel fire, I contacted the President of Cyprus, he was the first I turned to, and the Prime Minister of Greece, that they should send firefighting aircraft. They had one such aircraft. They took it out of its hangar and sent it here. Last night I ordered that three of our firefighting aircraft, out of our fleet of 13 or 14, be sent to help them, and the planes are now in Cyprus. This is part of the regional arrangement we have made with Cyprus and Greece about emergency assistance. I am pleased that we are able to extend this assistance.

Today, the Cabinet will discuss an assistance plan to strengthen communities in Judea and Samaria. This entails the work of many ministries on behalf of the residents there and will – inter alia – strengthen security, assist small businesses and encourage tourism.

Today the Cabinet will also discuss a comprehensive plan to respond to the absence of law enforcement against planning and construction offenses in the Arab sector. We have an interest in assisting Israel's Arab citizens and we are doing so in very many areas but completing the implementation of the plan will be done together with the completion of the necessary legislation vis-à-vis enforcement regarding planning and construction in this sector."
