"I am here at the command center in the _Kirya_, together with the Defense Minister, IDF Deputy Chief-of-Staff, the Director of the National Security Council and senior IDF commanders. Our forces are operating in several sectors. Several minutes ago, our pilots struck the Yemeni port of Hodeida, the main supply port for the Houthi terrorist regime. At the same time, our forces are operating in Gaza City with the objective, of course, of achieving the defeat of the enemy, but also to evacuate the population. We are currently making efforts to open additional routes to facilitate the quicker evacuation of the Gazan population, to separate it from the terrorists we want to attack."
