Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, attended the IDF Naval Cadets graduation ceremony and made the following remarks:

"Not far north of here, dozens and sometimes hundreds of innocent civilians are being slaughtered on a daily basis. Some of them have been killed with gas â€“ chemical weapons. This is a serious crime, a crime against humanity. Now, it must be ensured that the Syrian regime will be disarmed of its chemical weapons and the world needs to make certain that those who use weapons of mass destruction will pay the price for it. The message that Syria receives will be received in Iran. Today, the rule that has guided me in my most of my actions as Prime Minister and which I adhere to very carefully, is perhaps more valid than ever: If I am not for myself, who will be for me? If we are not for ourselves, who will be for us? We are for us. And the practical translation of this rule is that Israel will always be able to defend itself by itself against any threat. President Obama said this morning "Israel, can defend itself with overwhelming force' and this is true. This is the basis of our security."
