Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this evening welcomed the 50-21-0 Knesset vote to approve the draft national housing committees law on its first reading.

Prime Minister Netanyahu, who initiated and promoted the law, said that, "The Government of Israel has adopted a green track for housing, the goal of which is to accelerate the planning and construction processes. The Knesset approval constitutes an important step in increasing the supply of housing in Israel. The law will ease the housing situation and mainly assist young couples. I intend to act together with all Government ministries in order to shorten the bureaucratic processes that increase the housing plight."

According to the draft law, six national housing committees will be established in various districts. The committees will constitute a rapid track for approving public plans for housing only and will operate on short schedules in order to reduce construction times.

The draft law provides that the committees will be established for 18 months. Their goal is to reduce the shortage of approximately 80,000-100,000 apartments on the market, which has been created in the past decade.
