Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has issued the following response to the anticipated Histadrut [labor federation] strike tomorrow (Wednesday), 8.2.12, over the issue of contract workers:

"A strike will not solve the problem of contract workers. It is possible to improve the conditions of contract workers without striking the economy and disrupting citizens' lives. There is no magic solution to the employment problems that have been created here over decades; it is possible to resolve the issue through dialogue.

The Israeli economy is in a delicate situation and now is not the time to risk the stability that we have achieved at great effort and through cooperation between the Government and the Histadrut in the face of the collapse of some of the world's leading economies."
