"I heard the proposal brought by French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe. I met with him in Jerusalem last Thursday. We very much appreciate our French friends and I will respond to them after we have considered matters. We will study the proposal and discuss it with our American friends as well. The Americans also want to advance initiatives and we have our own thoughts as well. We will consider how the proposal fits in with other initiatives. Of course, they cannot all be implemented; we should concentrate on one and advance it. We would also like to emphasize and reiterate: Negotiations will not be conducted with a Palestinian government, half of which is Hamas, a terrorist organization that seeks to destroy Israel . I made it clear to Foreign Minister Juppe that Hamas must adopt the Quartet principles. If the claim that there is a new spirit in Hamas is true, then it can find expression in the release of Gilad Shalit. If Abu Mazen has such good ties with Hamas, he can pressure it to release Gilad. In any case, Hamas is not exempt from meeting the Quartet's conditions."
