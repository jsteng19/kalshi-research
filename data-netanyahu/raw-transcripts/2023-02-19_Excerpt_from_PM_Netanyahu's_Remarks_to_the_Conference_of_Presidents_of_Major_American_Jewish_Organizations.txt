Following is an excerpt from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks, this evening, at the Inbal Hotel in Jerusalem, to the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations: "In case you haven't noticed, Israel is in the midst of a little thing on judicial reform. I'd like to speak to you on it at length and to tell you why you shouldn't worry. But for the moment, I'm prevented from doing that because I've been given a gag order. I'm not making this up. I've been given a gag order. After all, who am I? I'm just the Prime Minister of Israel. What have I got to say about this thing that is gripping the nation. It is patently ridiculous. I hope you notice the grotesqueness of the situation, including President Herzog and one of the leading members of the Opposition and calls for my intervention. So for the moment, I'd just like to say three things. First, Israel is a democracy and will remain a democracy, with majority rule and proper safeguards of civil liberties. That's the first thing. The second thing is all democracies should respect the will of other free peoples, just as we respect their democratic decisions. The third is that there's been a lot of rhetoric that is frankly reckless and dangerous, including calls for bloodshed in the streets and calls for a civil war. It isn't going to happen. There's not going to be a civil war."
