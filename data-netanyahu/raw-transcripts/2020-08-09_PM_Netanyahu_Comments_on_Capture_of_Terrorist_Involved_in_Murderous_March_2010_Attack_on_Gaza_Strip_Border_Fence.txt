Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: "This morning I was told of the capture of the terrorist who was involved in planning the murderous March 2010 attack on the Gaza Strip border fence which claimed the lives of Staff Sgt. Ilan Sviatkovsky and Maj. Eliraz Peretz. All those who seek our ill should know that even if years pass, the State of Israel will not rest until we settle accounts with the terrorists."
