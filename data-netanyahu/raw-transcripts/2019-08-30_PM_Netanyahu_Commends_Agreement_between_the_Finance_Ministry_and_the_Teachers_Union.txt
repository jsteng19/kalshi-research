Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: "I commend Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon and Teacher's Union (Histadrut Hamorim) Secretary General Yaffa Ben-David who, after intensive negotiations, reached an agreement that will allow the opening of the 2019-2020 school year. Our teachers are an important asset to Israeli society and I would like to express my appreciation for their work. May everyone have a successful school year."
