Following is an excerpt from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s remarks, at Ben-Gurion International Airport, prior to his departure for Lisbon: “I am now leaving for Lisbon where I will meet with the Portuguese Prime Minister. However, my main goal is, first of all, to meet with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. On Sunday, I spoke with President Trump. The conversation mainly centered on Iran. The continuation of this conversation, with Secy. of State Pompeo, will focus primarily on Iran and on two other issues: The defensive alliance with the US, which I would like to advance, and future American recognition of applying Israeli sovereignty to the Jordan Valley. These are very important issues; we are dealing with them all the time. There are also other issues which I will not detail here.” In response to a journalist’s question, Prime Minister Netanyahu responded [in English]: “I think President Trump has placed tremendous pressures and sanctions on Iran. We're seeing the Iranian empire totter. We see demonstrations in Tehran, demonstrations in Baghdad, demonstrations in Beirut. It's important to increase this pressure against Iranian aggression. We also see that Iran wants to march forward with nuclear bombs development and ballistic missile development, including precision-guided munition. This has to be countered and the way to counter it is more pressure. I spoke out against six European countries that, instead of supporting now American sanctions, lessened American sanctions. That is wrong. I said, and I repeat it here today, they should be ashamed of themselves. While people are risking their lives and dying on the streets of Tehran, they are giving sustenance and support to this tyrannical regime. The tyrants of Tehran should not be supported now. They should be pressured.”
