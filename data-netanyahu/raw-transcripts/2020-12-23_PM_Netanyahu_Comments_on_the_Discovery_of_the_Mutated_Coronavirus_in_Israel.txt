Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, on the discovery of the mutated coronavirus in Israel:

"It is clear that we took the right steps when we closed the skies from Britain and the rest of the world. It is clear that we acted correctly when we required Israelis to quarantine in designated hotels. It is clear that we took the right steps we when sought to locate people who were in England and the other infected countries. Nevertheless, at the moment we need to assume that the virus is spreading here. The good news is that the assessments of the companies that are supplying us with vaccines are that there is a high – but not absolute – likelihood that these vaccines will deal with the mutation as well. We will know this in a few days; we have no guarantee that this will be the case. We need to wait in order to know this.

This strengthens what we are discussing here at the moment, to move forward very quickly with our vaccines operation which, at the moment is among the fastest in the world relative to the population and at the same time limit the spread of the disease, both of the previous virus and the mutation. These two things need to be done in tandem: A very rapid vaccines operation and restrictions. If we do this, we will be the first country in the world to emerge from the pandemic. It is possible. We can do this if we do it together."
