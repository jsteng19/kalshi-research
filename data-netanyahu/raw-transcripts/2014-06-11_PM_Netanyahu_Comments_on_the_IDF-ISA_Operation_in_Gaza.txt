Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening (Wednesday, 11 June 2014), made the following remarks about the IDF-ISA operation in the northern Gaza Strip:

"Our policy is clear - kill those who rise up to kill us. The IDF and the ISA carried out a precise operation and will continue to take strong action against all those who try to attack the security of Israel's citizens.

This is the true face of Hamas; it is continuing to plan terrorist attacks against Israeli citizens even as it inside the Palestinian government. I would like to remind the international community that Abu Mazen - on the day he formed a government with the Hamas terrorist organization - promised to honor all previous agreements. This means that he is responsible for disarming Hamas and the other terrorist organizations of the arsenals in Gaza."
