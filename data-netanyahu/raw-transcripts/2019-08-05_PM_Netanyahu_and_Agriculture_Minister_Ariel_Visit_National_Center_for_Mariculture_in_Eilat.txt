Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Agriculture Minister Uri Ariel, visited the National Center for Mariculture in Eilat. Prime Minister Netanyahu: "This is the food of the future. The technology is fantastic. We have decided to invest millions of shekels here, first of all, in order to jumpstart the research and, later, together with Minister Ariel, to bring in additional global companies. Many countries want this. Think of this as the Unit 8200 that we want to expand and involve startups with." The visit was pursuant to yesterday's Cabinet meeting in Eilat during which the plan to establish Eilat's status as an international research-application center in food from the sea, mariculture and marine bio-technology, was approved. The plan includes: * Establishment of a park for sea-based food industries, mariculture and marine bio-technology in the Mishtalot and Ein Evrona area. * Establishment of an innovation and knowledge community in marine biology and mariculture in Eilat and the Hevel Eilot Regional Council area and the attraction of foreign investors to Eilat with an emphasis on marine biology and mariculture. * Establishment of a team chaired by the Director General of the Prime Minister's Office to formulate plan to strengthen the National Center for Mariculture and advance a project to export young fish and raise tuna.
