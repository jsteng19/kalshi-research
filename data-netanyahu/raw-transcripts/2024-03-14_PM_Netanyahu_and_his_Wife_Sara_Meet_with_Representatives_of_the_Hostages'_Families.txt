Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara, today, at the Kirya in Tel Aviv, met with representatives of the families of the hostages.

Prime Minister Netanyahu told the families at the start of the meeting [translated from Hebrew]:

"We are committed to returning everyone. Even if we go to a multi-stage campaign, this includes everyone, both the casualties and the hostages.

I would be happy if I could be the bearer of good news for you today. As of this moment, there has been no real response from Hamas. They are still clinging to unacceptable demands.

They do not want to make progress. They want to ignite the ground during Ramadan. This is their attempt; this is their goal.

As a result of our pressure, the Government's, and also with your help, we are seeing – for the first time – Qatari pressure on Hamas.

I aspire to this and have been pushing for this for some time. I think that every trip and appearance of yours overseas, at the UN, in Washington, and in other capitals, has an effect. The Qatari pressure is beginning to work. Qatar has started to tell them: 'We will throw you out.' 'We will deny you funds.' This is what is being said; we have verified this. This is a change; it is something positive.

If anyone tells you that I do not want a deal, and that we are trying not to make one – this is nonsense.

At the moment there is a change in the Qatari pressure. This is the most positive thing I can say."

Also participating in the meeting were the Prime Minister's Chief-of-Staff, Tzachi Braverman, the Prime Minister's Military Secretary, Maj.-Gen. Avi Gil, Coordinator for the Hostages and the Missing Brig.-Gen. (Res.) Gal Hirsch, Hostages Authority Director Yaron Cohen and Varda Pomerantz from the Hostages Committee.
