Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today made the following remarks at the start of the discussion on draft legislation to advance competition and reduce cartelization:

"There is a witch-hunt against business people and we are against this. We very much appreciate the business sector and want to encourage it. They are desired and competed for throughout the world. However, we are not prepared to accept monopolies and cartels. We are in favor of competition as much as possible and we are against monopolies and cartels. This competition is carried out by business men and women. The added value to the economy is not created mainly by the Government or by government companies. We do not want to discourage initiatives and competition; neither do we want to discourage entrepreneurs. In the end, this is our economy. They pull the wagon for all of us, they bring the added value, they take risks."
