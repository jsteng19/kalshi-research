Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening, spoke with the two chief rabbis-elect, Yitzhak Yosef and David Lau. The Prime Minister congratulated them and said, "Now is the time to act to increase unity and love among the Jewish People."

Prime Minister Netanyahu invited both rabbis to join the Tanakh study circle that he holds at his residence, and which is named after his late father-in-law Shmuel Ben-Artzi.
