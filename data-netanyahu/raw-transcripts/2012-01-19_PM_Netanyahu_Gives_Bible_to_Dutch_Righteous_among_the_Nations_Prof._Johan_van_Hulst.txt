Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this morning met with the Dutch House of Representatives Chairperson Gerdi Verbeet and with Dutch Senate Chairperson Fred de Graaf.

After the meeting, the Prime Minister met with Dutch Righteous of the Nations Prof. Johan van Hulst and gave him a Bible as a mark of appreciation. Van Hulst told the Prime Minister about the most difficult moment in his life when he realized that he could not save all the children that he wanted.

Prime Minister Netanyahu replied that, "It is said that whoever saves a single life it as if he saved the whole world, and you saved hundreds. On behalf of the Jewish People and all of humanity, I would like to thank you." Van Hulst thanked the Prime Minister for the Bible and added that he has read and studied the Bible for many years. The Prime Minister replied, "I work six days a week and my Sabbath joy is to study the Bible."
