Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in New York City, met with US President Donald Trump, and made the following remarks at the joint statements:

"Mr. President, Donald, thank you, and this is a manifold thank you.

First, thank you for your strong words yesterday at the General Assembly against the corrupt terrorist regime in Iran. You back up your strong words with strong actions. And I think that the fact that you brought American sanctions to bear has cut the cash machine of Iran and its campaign of carnage and conquest of the Middle East. And we who live in the Middle East, Israelis and Arabs, who are subject to this Iranian danger, want to thank you especially.

Secondly, I want to thank you for the extraordinary support that you have shown for Israel in this building. In the U.N., no one has backed Israel like you do, and we appreciate it.

Third, this is the first time that we meet after the American Embassy has been moved to Jerusalem. You've changed history, and you've touched our hearts.

And fourth, and last, I want to say how much I appreciate your robust defense of Israel's right of self-defense, which you have just expressed. I think everybody should understand that Israel will continue to do what is necessary and defend ourselves against Iranian aggression in Syria, in Lebanon, anywhere else. And I want to say also that we have no doubt that as we do so, we'll enjoy the support of President Donald Trump and the United States of America.

I think, and I say this objectively, that the American-Israeli alliance has never been stronger. It's stronger than ever before under your leadership. And I look forward to working with you and your team to advance our common interests â€“ security, prosperity and peace with Israel's neighbors, and for the region. And we can do it with you."
