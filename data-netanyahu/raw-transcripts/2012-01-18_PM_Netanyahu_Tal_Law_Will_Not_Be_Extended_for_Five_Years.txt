Since the current Government has been in office, more ultra-orthodox men have enlisted than under any previous government. In 2011, 2,361 ultra-orthodox men enlisted in the IDF and civilian service, a 284% increase over 2008 (before the current Government took office).

It will be recalled that the Tal Committee was established in 1999, during Ehud Barak's tenure as Prime Minister. The Committee's recommendations were approved by the Sharon government in 2002 and the Kadima-led government in 2007.
