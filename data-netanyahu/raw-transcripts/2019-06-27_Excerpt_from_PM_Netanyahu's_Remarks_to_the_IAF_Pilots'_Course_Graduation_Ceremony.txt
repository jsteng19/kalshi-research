Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today (Thursday, 27 June 2019), at Hatzerim Air Force Base, addressed the Air Force pilots' course graduation ceremony. Following is an excerpt from his remarks: "President Trump recently recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, moved the US Embassy there, recognized our sovereignty over the Golan Heights and imposed sanctions, strong and biting sanctions, on Iran, which declares its intention to destroy us. There is no limit to our appreciation and our gratitude. However, we always remember that we must be prepared to defend ourselves by ourselves against any threat. This is the fundamental principle that ensures our security. Security control over the area west of the Jordan will always be in our hands. We will never give up our security and we will never relinquish the control to a foreign element. There are those who say that there will be no peace unless we relinquish the Jordan Valley. I say: If we relinquish the Jordan Valley we will ensure that there will be war."
