PM Netanyahu, this afternoon :

"I send heartfelt condolences to the families of those who were murdered in the terrorist attack at Re'em Junction, and am praying for the wounded. This attack reminds us that the entire country is on the frontline and that the murderers, who come not only from Gaza, want to kill us all. We will continue to fight until total victory, with all our might, on every front, everywhere, until we restore the security and quiet for all citizens of Israel."
