Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sent his condolences to the family of

Yafa Yarkoni

and noted that she was, "among Israel's greatest singers and an Israel Prize laureate for Hebrew song." He added that, "Yafa Yarkoni's songs were the soundtrack of Israel from its pre-state days, through the establishment of the state until our time. We will all miss her special voice and today, in keeping with her song, 'Don't say good-bye to me', we take our leave from her but not from the musical and cultural heritage that she has left behind."
