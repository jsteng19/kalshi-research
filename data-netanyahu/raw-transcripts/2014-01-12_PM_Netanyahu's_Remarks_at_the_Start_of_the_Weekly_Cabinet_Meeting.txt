Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made the following remarks at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting following a minute of silence in memory of the late former Prime Minister Ariel Sharon:

"We take leave from Ariel Sharon, the 11th Prime Minister of the State of Israel. Arik was, first and foremost, a warrior and a commander, among the Jewish People's greatest generals in the current era and throughout its history. He was dedicated to the security of the state from his youth, as a young fighter in the War of Independence, and afterwards as a commander in the 1956 Sinai operation, in the Six Day War and in the decisive battle – during the Yom Kippur War, in leading the IDF across the Suez Canal, which, for all intents and purposes, led to a successful conclusion of a war that began under very difficult conditions for the State of Israel.

He established Unit #101 and set two primary foundations for Israel's struggle against terrorism, initiative and retaliation, which stand to this day. He also continued this action as Defense Minister, in distancing terrorism from our northern border.

In all of his positions – Defense Minister, Housing Minister, Infrastructures Minister and Foreign Minister – Arik contributed to the State of Israel, as he also did as Prime Minister. I think that he represents the generation of Jewish warriors that arose for our people upon the resumption of our independence.

He was tied to the land; he knew that it had to be defended. He understood that above everything, our revival is our ability to defend ourselves by ourselves. I believe that he will be remembered in the heart of the Jewish People's forever as one of our most outstanding leaders and most daring commanders."
