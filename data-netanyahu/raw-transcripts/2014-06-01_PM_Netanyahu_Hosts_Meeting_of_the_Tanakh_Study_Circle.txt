Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara at their official residence in Jerusalem, hosted the fifth session of the Shmuel Ben-Artzi Tanakh Study Circle , named after the Prime Minister's late father-in-law.

The Tanakh Study Circle – held in cooperation with the Menachem Begin Heritage Center – was restarted two years ago. Similar study circles were held by former prime ministers David Ben-Gurion and Menachem Begin. This evening's meeting focused on the Book of Ruth, which will be read on Shavuot later this week.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said, "I have always thought and believed that the Tanakh is the foundation of our existence here. Otherwise we would be somewhere else or nowhere at all. The influence of the written words has not lessened over the generations; on the contrary, their strength has only increased. Therefore, I think that we need – here in the Prime Minister's Residence – to focus on the Tanakh every few months."
