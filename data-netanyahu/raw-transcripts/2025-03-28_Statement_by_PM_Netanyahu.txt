Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this afternoon: "Whoever has not yet internalized the new situation in Lebanon, has received an additional reminder of our determination. The equation has changed; what prevailed before October 7th will not recur. We will not allow firing at our communities, not even a trickle. We will continue to strongly enforce the ceasefire. We will attack anywhere in Lebanon against any threat to the State of Israel. We will ensure that all of our residents of the north will return safely to their homes."
