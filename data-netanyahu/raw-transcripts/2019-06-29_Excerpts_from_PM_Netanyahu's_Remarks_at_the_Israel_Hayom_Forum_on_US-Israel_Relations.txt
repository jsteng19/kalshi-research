Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara, this evening, at the Davidson Center in Jerusalem, attended the Israel Hayom forum on US-Israel relations. Following are excerpts from the Prime Minister's remarks: [English] "When the president walked away from the deal, Iran tried to do two things. First, they tried to implant themselves militarily in Syria. We resist that all the time. We refuse to accept, we will not let Iran entrench itself militarily in Syria. And we do what is necessary to prevent that. We’re fighting Iran militarily in Syria, and President Trump essentially is waging a very forceful confrontation with Iran economically. Iran is the single greatest threat to world peace today and on the horizon, and it should not be allowed to get nuclear weapons. To go back to the JCPOA means letting Iran get nuclear weapons. President Trump has said he will not let Iran get nuclear weapons. I, as the Prime Minister of Israel, will tell you I will not allow Iran to get nuclear weapons. It’s a mistake to go back to the JCPOA." [Translated from Hebrew] "I do not understand how it can be that the Palestinians, who need to look out for their people, receive proposals for massive investments worth tens of billions of dollars, and say: 'We are not interested.' This tells you that the ideology is much stronger and does not allow them even to help their own people. Jared Kushner and Jason Greenblatt were in Jerusalem and showed me the details of the plan. This plan is very strong. It has a deep idea, which is fundamentally important and genuine, and that is to replace welfare with investments."
