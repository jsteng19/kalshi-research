Prime Minister and Defense Minister Netanyahu, at the Defense Ministry in Tel Aviv, at the changeover ceremony for the IDF Deputy Chief-of-Staff, made the following remarks:

"Last night we settled accounts with the murderers from the terrorist attacks in the Barkan Industrial Zone and Ofra and today we suffered a harsh attack in which two soldiers were killed. We will settle accounts with whoever did this.

Our guiding principle is that whoever attacks us and whoever tries to attack us â€“ will pay with his life. Our enemies know this and we will find them."
