Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today hosted orphans who were celebrating their bar mitzvah ceremonies under the auspices of Colel Chabad and told the boys:

"I am moved by your joy. This is an important moment, reaching the age of mitzvoth in the Jewish People. It is significant not just in your personal lives but also in the national life of our people, an ancient people that keeps its traditions. This is also characteristic of the Chabad movement that seeks to include all of our people in the love of the people of Israel, the Torah of Israel and the Land of Israel. These are genuine things and you give them practical expression; I am certain that all of you will also give them expression in your personal lives. I wish that you all have good lives with much happiness and success, each and every one of you."
