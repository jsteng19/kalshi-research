Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in cooperation with Finance Minister Yuval Steinitz, Construction and Housing Minister Ariel Atias and Deputy Minister Gila Gamliel, this morning presented a plan to reduce housing prices. The goal of the plan is to ease conditions for the apartment-buying public and provide a significant response to the jump in housing prices. The plan focuses on young couples, discharged soldiers, students and other populations.

According to the plan:

Cheaper land for buying apartments – A 50% discount in the price of land will be given for the construction of apartments, in "price for tenant" tenders. In these tenders, contractors compete for the lowest price to be offered to those purchasing the apartments. Preference will be given to allocating apartments for young couples, discharged soldiers and national/civilian service graduates.

Reduced-cost rentals – The State will initiate the construction of apartments for long-term rental at reduced cost, with a 100% discount on the land. The discount will be given to the contractor that offers that lowest price to renters.

Solutions for student housing – The state will provide free land for the construction of 10,000 new dormitory units for students. Thus, rent for students who currently rent on the open market will be significantly reduced.

Reduction in public transportation costs for students – In order to open the housing market to students outside city centers, an immediate 50% rail and bus discount will be provided.In addition to the foregoing, the Israel Land Administration reform and the national building and planning committees law will be completed in the coming week, thus providing for the large scale marketing of land and the rapid and efficient planning of housing units throughout the country.
