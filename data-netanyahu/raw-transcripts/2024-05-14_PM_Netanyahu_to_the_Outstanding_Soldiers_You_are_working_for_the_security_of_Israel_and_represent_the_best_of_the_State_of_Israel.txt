Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, met with outstanding soldiers Lt. Achenape Maspin, who made aliyah from Ethiopia as a child, and with Sgt. Rachel Landers, who made aliyah from the US approximately two years ago. Both of them fought on October 7 in the Western Negev, then took part in the fighting in Gaza and are currently serving in various positions.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"I am now sitting here with Achenape and Rachel, two of our 120 outstanding soldiers, who are working for the security of Israel.

I would like to commend you. You represent the best of the State of Israel as well as our determination to defend our country and ensure its future."
