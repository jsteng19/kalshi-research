Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, met with German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle, and said at the start of their meeting:

"Welcome to Jerusalem. You’re a friend; Chancellor Merkel is a friend; and Germany is a friend of Israel. We both want the same thing – to achieve peace. We’re committed to peace and we’re working for peace. I have to say, on a sad note, that I think Europe, the European guidelines by the EU have actually undermined peace. They’ve hardened Palestinian positions, they seek an unrealistic end that everybody knows is not going to happen, and I think they stand in the way of reaching a solution which will only be reached by negotiations by the parties, and not by an external dictate. I think this is something that you know very well, and I look forward to discussing with you how, bilaterally and other ways, we can advance peace together."

German Foreign Minister Westerwelle said, "So let me just wish you the very best, personally and of course for the upcoming direct talks. We encourage everyone to stay on this track. We will support you."
