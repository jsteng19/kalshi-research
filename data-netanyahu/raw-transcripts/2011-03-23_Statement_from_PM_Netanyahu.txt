Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today before leaving for Moscow, discussed the terrorist attack in Jerusalem:

"This evening, I am leaving for Moscow in order to meet with President Medvedev and Prime Minister Putin. I will discuss with them a series of bilateral and regional issues, as well as the search for a peace process with security and issues that are very important for Israel's security. Before leaving, I consulted with Defense Minister Ehud Barak, Minister Matan Vilnai, IDF Chief-of-Staff Lt.-Gen. Benny Gantz, ISA Director Yuval Diskin and others. Since the Government was established, we have set a clear policy on security, the essence of which is a vigorous response to any attempt to harm Israeli citizens, and systematic and assertive preventive measures against terrorism. This policy has led to two years of quiet and security and I think that all Israelis have learned to recognize, welcome and enjoy the fruits of this quiet, to walk the streets without fear. The fact is that our southern communities have returned to normal life, as have residents of the north. This quiet is a major blessing. Recently, there have been elements that have tried to violate this quiet. They are trying to test our resolve and the fortitude of our people. They will learn that the Government, the IDF and the Israeli public have an iron will to defend the state and its citizens. We will act vigorously, responsibly and prudently in order to maintain the quiet and the security that have prevailed here over the past two years."
