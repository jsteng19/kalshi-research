Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, met with European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini and said at the start of their meeting:

"I'm very happy to see Minister Mogherini. She is I think one of the people who Israel is working with to try to restore security and calm, and I hope also, as I often say openly to you as a friend, a sense of fairness from Europe to the predicament that Israel faces, a democracy fighting terrorism and incitement.

A lot of this terrorism, virtually all of it, is driven by incitement from Hamas, from the Islamic Movement in Israel, and I regret to say, from the Palestinian Authority. And I think if we want to have any hope, we have to stop terrorism. If we want to stop terrorism, we have to stop the incitement. And that is one of the things that I hope to speak to you about, among other things, and it's good to see you again.
