Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed his deep sorrow over the passing of Yechiel Kadishai, a pillar of the national movement:

"Yechiel was modest, wise, witty and entirely dedicated to the Land of Israel and the Jewish People. He symbolized the love of our homeland and the willingness for self-sacrifice on its behalf. I met with him only a few months ago and spoke with him about his main role as the head of the late Prime Minister Menachem Begin's bureau. He accompanied Begin everywhere, both in the political wilderness and the state leadership, and helped him with immeasurable wisdom and commitment. Kadishai, who was the secretary of the Herut faction and a member of the Likud, was faithful to the values of the nation and ready for any mission to which he was assigned. Yechiel had a Jewish soul and a warm heart. Everyone loved him and rightly so. My wife Sara and I send our deepest condolences to his dedicated wife Esther and to all members of the Kadishai family."
