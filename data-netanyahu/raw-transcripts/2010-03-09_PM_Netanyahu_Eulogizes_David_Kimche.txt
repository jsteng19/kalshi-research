Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expresses his deep sorrow over the passing of David Kimche, who filled a long series of vital positions – for the State of Israel, the intelligence community and the foreign service – with great ability and dedication. "I remember many meetings with him," the Prime Minister said, "in which he analyzed the international arena very well. Dave's personality combined elegance, patriotism and sophistication; he loved people and exemplified how to fulfill a public mission."
