Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made the following remarks:

"Instead of interfering in the elections, Soleimani would do well to check the state of the Iranian bases that he is trying to establish in Syria. Our policy is clear and it will not change: We are determined to prevent Iran from militarily entrenching itself in Syria against the State of Israel."
