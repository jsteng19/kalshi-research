Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu strongly condemns the Irish legislative initiative, the entire goal of which is to support the BDS movement and harm the State of Israel.

The initiative gives backing to those who seek to boycott Israel and completely contravenes the guiding principles of free trade and justice.

Prime Minister Netanyahu instructed that the Irish Ambassador to Israel be summoned to the Foreign Ministry on this matter.
