PM Netanyahu, at Ben-Gurion International Airport, made the following remarks prior to boarding a plane for Vilna, Lithuania.

"I have been invited to the Baltic states summit. This is the first time that a Prime Minister of Israel will be visiting Lithuania and has been invited to this summit. This reflects Israel's growing stature around the world.

Of course, we are interested in tightening economic and diplomatic links with these countries just as they are interested in doing the same with us. I am also interested in balancing the not always friendly EU approach toward the State of Israel, in order to achieve an approach that is more fair and genuine to the State of Israel. I do this through contacts with blocs of countries within the EU, the countries of Eastern Europe, [and] now with the Baltic states and, of course, with other states.

Beyond this, during the visit to Lithuania I will, of course, recall the splendid Jewish community that was there, its great heights and the abyss of the tragedy of the Holocaust. There is also a personal aspect to this. The families of my parents – of blessed memory – came from Lithuania at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th; I am making this visit also for this."

Response to the question 'What is your opinion about railway work on Shabbat?'

"I do not think that it is reasonable to close a transportation axis, the Ayalon Highway, during the middle of the week. I think that this is understood and this will be taken into account. I do not think that traffic will be hindered in any way."

Response to the question 'Has Israel given up on its expectation that the US will recognize the Golan Heights in light of [US National Security Adviser John] Bolton's remarks?'

"I should give up on such on such a thing? That cannot be."
