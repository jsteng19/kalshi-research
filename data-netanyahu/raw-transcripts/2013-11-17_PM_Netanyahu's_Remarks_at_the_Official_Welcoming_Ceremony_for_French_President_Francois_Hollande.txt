Following is an excerpt from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks at the official welcoming ceremony for French President Francois Hollande this afternoon at Ben-Gurion International Airport:

"Israel views France as a true friend. France, like Israel, aspires to a stable, moderate Middle East in which the peoples live in peace with each other, in security and mutual respect. You, Mr. President, have taken a resolute stance regarding Syria, and in the face of Iran's relentless attempts to arm itself with nuclear weapons, which would endanger not just Israel, but regimes and countries throughout the Middle East; it would also endanger France, Europe and the entire world. Mr. President, you are a most welcome and esteemed guest in our country. All Israelis extend their hand to you in brave friendship and with the blessings of peace. Vive la France, vive l'Israel, vive l'amitie entre la France et l'Israel."
