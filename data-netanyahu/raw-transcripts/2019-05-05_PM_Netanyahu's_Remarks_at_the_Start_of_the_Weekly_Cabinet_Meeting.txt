Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting, made the following remarks: “First, I would like to send condolences to the family of Moshe Agadi, and to send best wishes for a quick and full recovery to the wounded. This morning, I instructed the IDF to continue massive attacks against terrorist elements in the Gaza Strip. I also ordered the reinforcement of the units around the Gaza Strip with armor, artillery and infantry. Hamas bears the responsibility not only for its own attacks and actions but also for the actions of Islamic Jihad, and it is paying a very heavy price for this. I ask that Israeli citizens strictly adhere to Home Front Command instructions; these instructions save lives. We are working – and will continue to work – to restore quiet and security to the residents of the south.”
