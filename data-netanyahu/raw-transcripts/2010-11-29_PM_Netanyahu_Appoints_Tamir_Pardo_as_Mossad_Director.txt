Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today decided to appoint Tamir Pardo as the next Director of the Mossad, subject to approval by the Turkel Committee. Pardo has served in various senior Mossad positions – most recently as Deputy Director – for many years. The Prime Minister said that he is certain that Pardo is the right person to lead the Mossad in the coming years in light of the complex challenges facing the State of Israel.

Prime Minister Netanyahu expressed his deep appreciation for the great contribution that outgoing Mossad Director Meir Dagan has made to the security of Israel. The Prime Minister added that he is certain that Dagan will continue to contribute to the State of Israel.
