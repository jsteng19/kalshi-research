Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke by telephone last night with Elon Musk. "We are at the dawn of a new era for humanity, an era of artificial intelligence. Things are changing at a dizzying pace and Israel must formulate a national policy on this issue. Last night I had a long conversation with Elon Musk, whose insight and contribution to humanity I hold in high esteem. He spoke at length about two things. First, about the need for governments to understand both the opportunities and the dangers of artificial intelligence. Second, he expressed his view that Israel could become a significant global player in the field. I am certain that this is true and we will do it. I also spoke with Sam Altman, who also expressed his view that Israel could become a main global player in the field. In the coming days, I intend to convene policy teams to discuss a national artificial intelligence policy in the both the civilian and the security spheres. Just as we turned Israel into a global cyber power, we will also do so in artificial intelligence."
