Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today (Thursday), 9.12.10, expressed his deep sorrow over the passing of former Knesset Speaker Dov Shilansky:

"The People of Israel have lost one of its most dedicated and exemplary leaders. Shilansky was among the founders of the national movement who survived the Holocaust. He dedicated his life to ensuring the revival of the Jewish People on its Land. In all of his posts, but especially that of Knesset Speaker, he was a symbol of integrity and the absolute commitment to the Jewish People, the memory of the Holocaust, Zionism, the Land of Israel and moral human values. The entire nation bows its head in memory and deep appreciation of his work and his personality. The story of his life is the story of our people."
