Following is an excerpt from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting:

"It seems that the nuclear talks in Iran have yielded a collapse, not a breakthrough. The major powers' concessions are increasing. The deal being formulated will pave Iran's path to the production of very many atomic bombs and it will also channel to Iran hundreds of billions of dollars that will serve its aggression and terrorism campaigns in our region and around the world.

This is a bad deal. It is not less bad – in my opinion it is worse – than the deal with North Korea that led to a nuclear arsenal in North Korea. But this is both a non-conventional threat, and a very large conventional threat, against Israel, the countries of the region and the world.

We again send our condolences to the Egyptian government and people that are fighting ISIS, our common enemy and that of humanity as well. We are monitoring all the events and are taking all necessary measures. Among others, today we understand – of course – the importance of the security fence we built on the Sinai border, which prevents, or renders very difficult, ground infiltrations by ISIS and other terrorist elements. We built a similar fence on the Golan Heights against ISIS and other terrorist elements there, and, as you know, we have also started to build a security fence on our eastern border."
