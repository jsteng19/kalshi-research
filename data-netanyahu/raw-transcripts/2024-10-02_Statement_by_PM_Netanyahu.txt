Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu:

"I wish to extend my deepest condolences to the families of our heroes who fell today in Lebanon.

May God avenge them. May their memory be a blessing.

We're in the heat of a grueling war against Iran's axis of evil, aimed at destroying us. That will not happen, because we shall stand together, and with God's help, we shall emerge victorious together.

We will return our hostages in the south, return our residents in the north, and ensure the eternity of Israel".
