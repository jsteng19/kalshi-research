Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this afternoon in Jerusalem, participated in a soccer game between Jewish and Arab youth, in the framework of an international project to promote tourism to Israel. During the game, the Prime Minister slipped on the field, rose, continued to play and scored a goal.

During a subsequent examination, expert orthopedist Dr. Leon Kaplan diagnosed a suspected tear in one of the Prime Minister's tendons. A CT scan at Hadassah-Mt. Scopus Hospital confirmed the diagnosis. The Prime Minister's left leg was placed in a cast for several weeks.

Prime Minister Netanyahu returned home and will be back at work at his office tomorrow.
