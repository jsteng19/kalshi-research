Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Deputy Minister Ofir Akunis, today in Lod, under the aegis of the Computer for Every Child project, gave new tablets to 94 underprivileged children. The event was held in the Lod cultural center.

In the past year, under Deputy Minister Akunis's leadership, the project has been upgraded from "Computer for Every Child" to "Tablet for Every Child" in order to place the initiative at the forefront of technology and provide children with more innovative and sophisticated tools.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said, "We are canceling the periphery. You may notice that you are traveling on the country's highways and are seeing major works: Highways, railways, interchanges and bridges. We are linking south and north and are also laying fiber optic cables from Kiryat Shemona to Eilat in order to cancel the geographic and social peripheries."

Deputy Minister and Chairman of the project's public council Akunis said, "This evening we are doing an act of true social justice. We do not suffice with words, slogans and clich√©s. We are simply doing. There are no equal and less equal and all Israeli children deserve equal opportunities. Reducing the digital gap means reducing the social gap."
