Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued the following statement on the sealing of the home of the terrorist who committed the 18 November 2014 attack on a synagogue in the Har Nof neighborhood of Jerusalem:

"The terrorists and those who send them will continue to pay a heavy price. Terrorism has a price, including to the lone attacker. We will also apprehend the murderers who perpetrated the recent attacks in which Malachi Rosenfeld and Danny Gonen were murdered."
