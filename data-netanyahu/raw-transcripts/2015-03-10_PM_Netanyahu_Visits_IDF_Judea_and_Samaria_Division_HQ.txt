Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the IDF Judea and Samaria Division HQ. Following is an excerpt from his remarks:

"One week after my address to Congress I get the impression that there are more and more voices, especially in the US but also in other places, that support Israel's position, which I presented to both houses of Congress: The agreement being formulated between the major powers and Iran gives a clear path to Iran to achieve a nuclear bomb, nuclear bombs; a better agreement must be sought. I think that this is important for the security of Israel, the region and the world, but first and foremost for Israel, and I can only hope that these more realistic views will receive tangible expression in the negotiations. In any case, we are closely monitoring developments and we will continue to have our say on an issue that is so fateful for the future of the State of Israel.

I am accompanied today by Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon and IDF officers in order to observe our activity here. The activity of the IDF and the security services is essential to prevent a takeover by radical elements that would certainly attack Israel and threaten our communities and our people, and would also threaten the Palestinian Authority and take control of the Palestinian public."
