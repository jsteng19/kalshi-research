Following is an additional excerpt from Prime Minister Netanyahuâ€™s remarks at the start of the Cabinet meeting:

"At the start of my remarks, I would like to welcome the fact that the period of restrictions on Jonathan Pollard has not been extended and that the restrictions have been lifted. I am certain that I speak for all Cabinet ministers, and very, very many in Israel, when I express this.

I thank Israeli Ambassador to the US Ron Dermer for leading the contacts with the American administration and for leading the contacts with Jonathan Pollard. He held over 150 conversations with him in recent years. Thank you, Ron.

I anticipate seeing Jonathan Pollard arrive in Israel soon, together with his wife Esther. I would like to extend my best wishes to them together with all Israelis."
