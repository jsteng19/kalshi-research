Following is an excerpt from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahuâ€™s remarks at the start of the Corona Cabinet meeting, today:

"On the issue of the vaccinations committee, I would like to make it clear: There is a professional committee that was established and is dealing with the issue of vaccines including the manner in which they will be allocated. The political elements must be kept away from it, as is done around the world. We have checked this in other countries and this is what they do there. This is a completely professional committee."
