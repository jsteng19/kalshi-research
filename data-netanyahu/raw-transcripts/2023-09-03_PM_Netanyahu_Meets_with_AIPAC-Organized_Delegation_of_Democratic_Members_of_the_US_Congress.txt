Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem, met with an AIPAC-organized delegation of Democratic members of the US Congress, led by US Rep. Lucy McBath (D-GA). Prime Minister Netanyahu at the start of the meeting: "I can say that I'm delighted to meet all of you. I really mean that. Many of you have been here before and some of you perhaps are coming for the first time. It's an opportunity to cement our relationship which is always based on a bipartisan relationship between Israel and both sides of the House and both sides of the Senate. It's very important for us, and I view this meeting as an important building block in this relationship. I'd like to have the opportunity to hear you. Perhaps you'll have an opportunity to hear me. But I think the support that we have received from you for the State of Israel is vitally important. So I want to thank you and I mean that from the heart and the mind." Attending the meeting were the Strategic Affairs Minister, the Director of the National Security Council, the Head of the National Public Diplomacy Directorate and the Prime Minister's Foreign Policy Adviser.
