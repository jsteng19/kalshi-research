Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today visited the Israel State Archives and was briefed on the material stored there and how it is preserved. He toured the restoration lab where he viewed historic materials from various periods of the Land and State of Israel, including – inter alia – the Declaration of Independence, which was taken out of the safe in which it is kept and David Ben-Gurion's signed order establishing the IDF.

Recent Government decisions regarding the Archives include those of 21 February 2010 , 25 March 2012 , 14 April 2013 and 17 November 2013 .

State Archivist Dr. Yaakov Lazovik told Prime Minister Netanyahu that the foregoing decisions, which were made in order to advance the work of the Archives are in advanced stages of being carried out. Millions of documents and video and audio files have already been scanned and digitized; many of them are now online for public use. Dr. Lazovik also said that the new advanced facility in Arad will be ready (in 2016-17) and that the reform of the Archives' work, the goal of which is to deal with the challenges of digital documentation, is underway.

Dr. Lazovik gave Prime Minister Netanyahu copies of documents regarding Cabinet discussions of the 1976 Entebbe operation in which the latter's brother Yonatan fell, and from correspondence between his late father, Benzion Netanyahu, and former Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion.

At the conclusion of the visit, Prime Minister Netanyahu said, "I am pleased and moved to see these interesting items that tell the story of the foundation of the State of Israel and various events that fashioned, and are still fashioning, our lives. We are the people of the book and must also preserve the book for future generations."
