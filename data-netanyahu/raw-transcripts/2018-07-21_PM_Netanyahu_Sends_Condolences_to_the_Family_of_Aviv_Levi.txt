Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening, issued the following statement:

"I send condolences from the bottom of my heart, for myself and for the citizens of Israel, to the parents and siblings of Aviv Levi, an IDF Givati Brigade fighter who fell yesterday on the Gaza border.

Together with his comrades, Aviv fought with determination and heroism against terror from the Gaza Strip. To our sorrow, this struggle sometimes claims a price that is heavy for us to bear. Our hearts are with the family."
