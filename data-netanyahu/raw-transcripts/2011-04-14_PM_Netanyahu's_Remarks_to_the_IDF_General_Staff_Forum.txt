Following are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks to the IDF General Staff Forum today:

"First of all, thank you, IDF Chief-of-Staff Lt.-Gen. Benny Gantz, and thank you, IDF commanders, for the important work you do all year round, and not just before Passover, in defending the State of Israel and its people.

It has already been said that if our enemies laid down their arms there would be peace but that if we laid down our arms there would be no more Israel. We know that not only peace but also our very existence depends on one thing – the defensive shield of the IDF and this is the great change that has occurred in the history of our people, which has lacked a defensive shield. Upon the re-establishment of its independence and sovereignty in its land, it founded its military.

While in every generation there are still enemies that are trying to destroy us, in this generation we have the tools – namely the IDF, its soldiers and commanders, who are represented here – to repel these attacks.

I would like to thank you for the change that we, that you, have brought about for the Jewish People.

We have great and varied challenges, which we just discussed in our meeting. However, I have no doubt that just as our country faces threats that no other country in the world faces, it concentrates forces within it, the strength of the Jewish People, that will enable it to overcome any and all obstacles. It will overcome them thanks to the spark of life, commitment to the future, creative genius and dedication that arise from this People and find expression in the IDF.

Therefore, there is no better time to toast the IDF and thank it for ensuring the existence, security and future of Israel. To all these I raise a glass. L'chaim! Happy Passover."
