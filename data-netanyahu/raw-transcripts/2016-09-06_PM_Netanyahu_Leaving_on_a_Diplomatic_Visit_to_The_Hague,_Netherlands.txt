Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will leave on a diplomatic visit to the Hague, Netherlands.

Before boarding the plane, Prime Minister Netanyahu said:

"I am constantly monitoring the rescue efforts at the disaster site in Tel Aviv. I visited there last night. I was deeply impressed by the work of the rescue units led by GOC Home Front Command. The people are doing exceptional work on the highest professional level to be found anywhere in the world. There are still people trapped; we are making every effort and are not giving up on anyone. We will reach them all.

I am now leaving on a diplomatic visit to the Netherlands. I will meet there with Israel's friend, and my personal friend, Prime Minister Mark Rutte, with members of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Dutch parliament and with King Willem-Alexander.

Europe as a whole is undergoing changes. It faces very great challenges over the spread of radical Islamic terrorism. I am going to speak with my interlocutors about the central role of Israel in the Middle East as the most stable element and one that contributes greatly to preventing the spread of radical Islamic terrorism. This is a new understanding; it is important, of course, for Israel and the states of the region but it is also very important for Europe. It is this understanding that we are working to instill gradually in all European countries."
