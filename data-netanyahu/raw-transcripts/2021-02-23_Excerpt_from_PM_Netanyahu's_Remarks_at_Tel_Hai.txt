Following is an excerpt from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks today, at the state memorial ceremony for Yosef Trumpeldor and his comrades who fell in defense of Tel Hai:

"I have important news. I spoke yesterday evening with my friend, Pfizer Chairman and CEO Albert Bourla. We agreed that there will be a continuous supply of Pfizer vaccines without any shortage by Pfizer, without any shortage, interruption or halt. Go and be vaccinated. We are also receiving more and more and more vaccines from Moderna. Go and be vaccinated."
