Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening, spoke with Israel's men's judo team coach Oren Smadja and congratulated him on judoka Peter Paltchik's winning a bronze medal and judoka Inbar Lanir's winning a silver medal at the Paris Olympics. Prime Minister Netanyahu to Oren Smadja: "What an achievement. What a personal achievement for you. This is a truly amazing personal achievement, that you, from the depth of your pain, succeeded in bringing this blessing to the State of Israel. This is simply unbelievable. Tell Inbar and Peter on my behalf, this is hard to believe. The medal is yours; the medal is for the people of Israel. I say this with all my heart, you are smply amazing and inspire us all. This could happen any time but at this time it is something else entirely. The fact that you are there and leading this, it makes this doubly meaningful. I ask of you one thing, I want you to give my heartfelt love to your family, to your wife. You deserve this, we all embrace you." Oren Smadja to the Prime Minister: "When you came to me, I was in a very difficult place. After the week of mourning, the first thing I did was to call the family together, my wife and the kids, to get their approval to fly. Today we showed everyone what a fantastic country this is, how much we can succeed if we are together. We love this country and I am the proudest person in the world that we have given this joy and hope to this fantastic country."
