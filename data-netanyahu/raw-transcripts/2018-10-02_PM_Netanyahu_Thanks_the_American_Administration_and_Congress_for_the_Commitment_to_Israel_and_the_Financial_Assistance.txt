Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu:

"I thank the American administration and Congress for their commitment to Israel and also for the American financial assistance in the coming decade.

Israel and the world face complex security challenges, especially Iranian aggression. The unreserved US support for Israel's right to defend itself is among the pillars of the strong bond between the two countries."
