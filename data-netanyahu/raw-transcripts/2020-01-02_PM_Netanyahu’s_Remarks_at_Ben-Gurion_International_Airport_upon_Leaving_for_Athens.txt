Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, at Ben-Gurion International Airport, upon leaving for Athens: “We are leaving for a very important summit with the President of Cyprus and the new Greek Prime Minister. We have established an alliance in the eastern Mediterranean, an alliance that is of great importance both for the energy future of the State of Israel and its becoming an energy power, and for regional stability. The gas pipeline that we are now going to advance, which Minister Steinitz has been working on for many years, is what will effect a revolution in Israel’s energy picture. We will not only bring about the lowering of gas prices and later of electricity prices but this will also direct hundreds of billions into state coffers to benefit Israel’s citizens including the elderly and children, health and social services. This is fantastic and this is what we are busy with. We are providing impetus for gas and for all of the other great achievements that we have brought and which we will continue to bring to the State of Israel in the coming years. Moreover, we know that our region is stormy; very, very dramatic things are happening in it. We are alert and are monitoring the situation. We are in continuous contact with our great friend the US, including my conversation yesterday afternoon. I want to make one thing clear: We fully support all of the steps that the US has taken as well as its full right to defend itself and its citizens.”
