Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this afternoon, made the following remarks regarding the vehicular terrorist attack in Samaria:

"I would like to praise the action of the IDF soldiers who reacted quickly and neutralized the terrorist, and to wish a full recovery to the injured.

I find it strange that those who hastened to condemn terrorism against Palestinians are silent when terrorism is directed against Jews."
