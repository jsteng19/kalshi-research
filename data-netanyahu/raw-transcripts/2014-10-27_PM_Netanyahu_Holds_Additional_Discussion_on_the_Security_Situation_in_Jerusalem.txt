Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this morning (Monday, 27 October 2014), in continuation of his previous discussions on the security situation in Jerusalem, held an additional meeting with the participation of Public Security Minister Yitzhak Aharonovitch, Justice Minister Tzipi Livni, Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat, ISA Director Yoram Cohen, senior Israel Police officials, the Deputy Attorney General, IDF representatives and other elements.

Prime Minister Netanyahu directed that draft legislation regarding severe punishment for stone-throwing be advanced as quickly as possible. Representatives from the State Attorney's office said that they have already called for detention and stiffer punishments for stone-throwers including criteria for the possible imposition of economic sanctions on the parents of minors who throw stones.

Participants were briefed on the wide-ranging Israel Police activity at points of friction in Jerusalem, including the reinforcement of units and the use of aerial surveillance.

Prime Minister Netanyahu reiterated the need to counter the campaign of incitement being waged against Israel regarding the Temple Mount, a campaign that is being led by Islamic elements and by Palestinian Authority Chairman Abu Mazen. The Prime Minister stressed that there has been no change in the status quo on the Temple Mount and added that there is no intention to make any changes whatsoever in this sphere.
