Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today, met with the contestants of

the International Bible Quiz

, which will be held on

Independence Day

. Fifty-three young people from countries around the world, including four contestants from Israel, will compete in this year's Quiz.

Prime Minister Netanyahu wished the contestants success and said, "I call on you to immigrate to Israel. The story of the Bible is not a simple story. It is a real story that occurred in real places and involved exemplary people like the prophet Isaiah, King David and many others. This is your country. This is your story. This is your heritage. I call on you to translate the Bible not into foreign languages but into actions. I would like you to come and live here and, as Jewish young people, to become part of history. Come here and succeed."

Education Minister Gideon Saar, IDF Chief Education Officer Brig.-Gen. Eli Shremeister and International Bible Quiz Coordinator Maj. Rabbi Malachi Raabed also attended today's meeting.
