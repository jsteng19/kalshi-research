Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem, met with Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and made the following remarks:

"We would like to take advantage of the great opportunities of the new world, but there are those who would like to take us backward to the old world of the dark and murderous Middle Ages, and we are partners in the war on radical Islamic terror.

Israel, Russia and he US and many other countries share the goal of eliminating Daesh.

I think that cooperation between all of the elements I have said toward this goal serves each one of us and also serves humanity.

To the same extent, we are also concerned by the second element leading radical Islam and this is Iran which champions the destruction of Israel and also supports 360 degree terror on five continents.

We are determined to do two things: First, prevent Iran from achieving nuclear weapons and second, to prevent Iran – in any situation that arises in Syria, with or without an agreement – from establishing itself militarily in Syria, on the ground, in the air or at sea. We are also determined to prevent it from bringing about the establishment of Shiite militias, which it is organizing, and of course, the arming of Hezbollah with dangerous weapons aimed at us."

Prime Minister Netanyahu also told his Russian counterpart: "I would like to thank you for your willingness to help on a humanitarian matter of the highest order – returning the bodies of Hadar Goldin and Oron Shaul, and the three Israeli citizens being held in Gaza."
