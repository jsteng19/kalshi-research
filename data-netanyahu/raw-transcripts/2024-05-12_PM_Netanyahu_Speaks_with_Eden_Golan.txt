Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, spoke with Eden Golan, Israel's representative to the Eurovision Song Contest:

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"Eden, what success and what honor you have brought us. They booed you and we shouted 'Douze points!'

I saw that you received almost the highest number of votes from the public and this is the most important thing, not from the judges but from the public, and you held Israel's head up high in Europe. You have brought immense pride to the State of Israel and the people of Israel. Congratulations!"

Eden Golan:

"I was proud to have the privilege of representing our country. We accomplished the impossible and it was a great privilege. I felt our country's love and everyone's support, and it was unforgettable."
