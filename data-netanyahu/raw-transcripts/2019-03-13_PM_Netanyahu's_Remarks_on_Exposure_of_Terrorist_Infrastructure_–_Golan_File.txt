Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, made the following remarks on the IDF exposure of a Hezbollah terror network on the Golan Heights:

"This morning Israel exposed a Hezbollah terror network on the Golan Heights. Hezbollah is a terror organization. It's a proxy of Iran. It does Iran's bidding and this terror network is part of Iran's aggression against Israel.

So I have a clear message for Iran and for Hezbollah: Israel knows what you're doing; Israel knows where you're doing it. What we've uncovered today is just the tip of the iceberg. We know a lot more.

Israel will continue to do all that's necessary to defend itself. We will continue to use all means, overt and covert, to block Iran's effort to use Syria, Lebanon and Gaza as forward bases for attacking Israel."
