Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening, made the following remarks: "I do not ignore the threats of the Iranian regime but neither am I intimidated by them. If this regime makes the awful mistake of trying to destroy Tel Aviv and Haifa, it will not succeed. However, this would be the last anniversary of the revolution that they celebrate. They should take this into account."
