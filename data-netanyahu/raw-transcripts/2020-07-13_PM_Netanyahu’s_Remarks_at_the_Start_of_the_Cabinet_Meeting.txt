Following are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s remarks, today , at the start of the Cabinet meeting: “Today, we are submitting for Cabinet approval the comprehensive economic plan for wage earners, the self-employed and business owners in the coming year. This plan is designed to provide a safety net for whoever was hurt by the outbreak of the virus. I know that it is not complete; I also know that there are holes in it. The Finance Minister and I have already spoken, and I intend to speak about this also with Benny Gantz, in order to provide a response to the holes in the net. There are many things that need to be dealt with, including help for families, sectors and other things. We will deal with all of these; at the end of the meeting, we will discuss the best way to do this. However, now there is a comprehensive and unprecedented plan, for which I would like to commend the Cabinet. Yesterday, we successfully passed, unanimously, the immediate grant for the self-employed, and now there is a series of things that we need to do, first of all to give the same safety net and later, of course, to act vigorously to create and incentivize a return to work.”
