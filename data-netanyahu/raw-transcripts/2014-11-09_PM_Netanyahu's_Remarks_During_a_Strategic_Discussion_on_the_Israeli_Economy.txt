Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, made the following remarks during a strategic discussion on the Israeli economy: "We must – and it is possible to – reduce and even eliminate duties on imported food. This could be done by a signed order from the Finance Minister. This is a step that would immediately create competition and lower prices. If the treasury needs to make up any shortfalls in the wake of these steps, or if it will be necessary to subsidize bodies that might be hurt, it would be possible to raise at least some of the amount from taxing those who own three or more homes."
