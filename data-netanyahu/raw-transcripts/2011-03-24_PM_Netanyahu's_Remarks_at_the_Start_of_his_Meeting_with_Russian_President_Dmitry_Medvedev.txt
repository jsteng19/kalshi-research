Following are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks at the start of

his meeting with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev today in Moscow

"Mr. President,

We met here not long ago and have since spoken by telephone. It is true that we have experienced earthquakes in Japan and New Zealand, and in the Middle East and in North Africa. There have been floods, sandstorms, a tsunami and fires. We had a massive fire and I called to thank you. You sent pilots immediately. They showed exemplary courage and professionalism. They made a great impression on us and I would like to take this opportunity to thank you and Russian Government again for the rapid assistance that you extended to us in our hour of need.

Now, other fires must be put out. None of us know how the shock, which has struck the entire Arab world and a considerable portion of the Islamic world, will end. I think that we have a common desire that there should be stable, progressive and modern governments that aspire toward peace.

Israel, Russia and the entire modern world must prevent the establishment here of radical, perhaps radical Islamic, regimes that could threaten the peace of the region, of Israel and of Russia. One such regime aspires to this result and that is

the radical regime in Iran

, which is not only seeking to arm itself with nuclear weapons but is threatening to use them against us, and is threatening to wreck not only any peace agreement but any modern regime that arises. It wants to return us to the ninth century. We have an interest in stopping the bad and advancing the good. I would be pleased to discuss with you how to advance peace and security in our region. I am anxious to discuss this with you.

Again, I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for the cooperation. We have many, many more areas in which we can cooperate."
