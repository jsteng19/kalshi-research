Following is an excerpt from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks, this evening, prior to departing for Berlin:

"I am now departing on a visit to Berlin, where I will meet with the German Chancellor. The main subject that I will discuss is Iran, as well as other issues that are important to the State of Israel. The security issues do not take a break, even for a moment.

Now I am going to Berlin. You are welcome to come along."
