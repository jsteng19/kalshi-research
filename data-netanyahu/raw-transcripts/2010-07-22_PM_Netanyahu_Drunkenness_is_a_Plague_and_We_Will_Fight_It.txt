Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcomes the Knesset completion yesterday, of legislation he promoted on restricting the sale of alcoholic beverages. He noted that this was merely the first step in the war on the spreading phenomenon of youth drinking.

The new law will soon ban the sale of alcoholic beverages in stores, kiosks and supermarkets between 23:00-06:00.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said that completion of the legislation is an central component in the national plan to reduce alcohol consumption,

which the Government decided upon on at its 20.12.09 meeting

: "I promised to pass this legislation and am pleased that we have succeeded. This is a first step. Additional steps to defeat the phenomena of drunkenness and violence, especially among minors and young people, are expected soon. At the same time, we will step up our efforts in the areas of education and information. Drunkenness has become a plague on society, on every society, and we are determined to fight it all-out. It hurts me to see young people, sometimes just children, hanging around outside kiosks at night and drinking until they become inebriated and even pass out. This is awful and leads to violence. We must do everything to stop it. I believe that the steps we have taken, and will yet take, in the fields of legislation, law-enforcement and education will contribute to reducing violence and drunk-driving, which causes deadly accidents and the loss of life. I would like to thank the various ministries that were involved, especially Public Security Minister Yitzhak Aharonovitch."
