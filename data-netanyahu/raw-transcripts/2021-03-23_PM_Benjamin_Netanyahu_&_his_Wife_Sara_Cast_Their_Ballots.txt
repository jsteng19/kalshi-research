Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara today (Tuesday, 23 March 2021), at the Beit Chinuch Ironi Gimmel high school in Jerusalem, cast their ballots.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"This is a holiday for Israel, a day of joy and smiles. We are going out in order to realize the democratic right. For me it is very moving to come with my wife, who just had a very difficult week. I am grateful for all the wishes from all citizens of Israel. You touched our hearts and moved us and it is wonderful to see you, Sara, healthy as you go to vote.

It also moves me to come here, 100 meters from the place where I studied in first grade, and to come back here and vote in our state, which is a global wonder. I call on everyone to go out of your homes and realize the democratic right to vote."

Sara Netanyahu:

"A big thank-you to the medical teams at Hadassah Ein Kerem hospital who cared for me with such dedication. Thank you very much to the many citizens from all over the State of Israel, including all parts of the political spectrum, who sent me their recovery wishes. This greatly moved me and gave me strength. Thank you to everyone; I love you. I also thank my husband very much."
