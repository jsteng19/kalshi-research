Following is an excerpt from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s remarks, this afternoon at the memorial ceremony for the fallen of the Altalena, at the Nachalat Yitzhak cemetery in Tel Aviv: "We are holding open and secret contacts with many leaders of the Arab world and there are ramified contacts between the State of Israel and Arab countries, with most of the Arab countries. Very soon there will be an important conference in Bahrain, that we welcome, at which the US will try to bring about a better future for -- and resolve problems of – the region. Of course, Israelis will be present. At the start of next week, there will be an historic and unprecedented meeting in Jerusalem between the national security advisers of the US, Russia and Israel. This is a very important summit for ensuring stability in the Middle East during turbulent times. What is important about this trilateral meeting, of the two superpowers in the State of Israel is that it greatly attests to the current international standing of Israel among the nations."
