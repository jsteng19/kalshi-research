Prime Minister Netanyahu, during his visit to Hatzor Air Force Base, spoke with GOC Air Force Maj.-Gen. Amikam Norkin and the Squadron 105 commander Lt.-Col. A, who told him about the commemorative flypast planned by the Israeli and German air forces over the Dachau concentration camp.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"This flypast is very symbolic because you will be flying over Dachau, where a massacre of the Jewish people was perpetrated. The difference is that you will be flying there with the air force of the Jewish state. The threat today does not come from Germany but from Iran. However, the great lesson of the Holocaust is that nobody will defend the Jews if we do not defend ourselves. Today we defend ourselves. I wish you success."

GOC Air Force Maj.-Gen. Norkin:

"Next week two F-16 squadrons will be flying out to the first deployment in the history of the air force, the first IDF exercise on German soil. Lt.-Col. A will lead this exercise. In addition to the training that we are teaching the German air force, this flight also has national significance. By remembering the past, we ensure the future."

Squadron commander Lt.-Col. A:

"There is great significance in leading – for the first time in history – a deployment of combat jets to Germany. We come with a very clear message, that we have an obligation to commemorate and remember the darkness of the past and we also have a great responsibility, certainly as the third generation from the Holocaust, to shape the future and ensure a more secure place for all of us through such aerial diplomacy."
