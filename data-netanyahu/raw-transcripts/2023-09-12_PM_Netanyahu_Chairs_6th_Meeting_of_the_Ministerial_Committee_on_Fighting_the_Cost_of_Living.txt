Prime Minister Netanyahu: "We are taking rapid steps toward opening the Israeli market to all European products."

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today , at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem, chaired the sixth meeting of the ministerial committee on the fight against the cost of living.

The Prime Minister directed a memorandum on draft legislation to open the Israeli market to products being marketed in Europe, be submitted within approximately one month. The committee discussed the significance of accepting the European standard and the practical implications of the Prime Minister's directive.

Prime Minister Netanyahu at the end of the meeting:

"We are taking rapid steps toward opening the Israeli market to all European products. What is good in Europe is good in Israel.

The decision that we just made in the ministerial committee on the cost of living is that by the opening of the Knesset session on 15 October, we will submit a memorandum on draft legislation to open the Israeli market to all European products. There will be exceptions but everything other than the exceptions will be permitted. This is the exact opposite of what we have now in which everything is prohibited except that which is permitted. From now on everything will be permitted except that which is prohibited.

This is a major change. This is a revolution. I would like to thank the ministers who have been working on this as well as their teams that have been assisting with this revolutionary change.
