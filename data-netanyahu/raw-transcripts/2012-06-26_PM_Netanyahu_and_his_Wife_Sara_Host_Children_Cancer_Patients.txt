Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara Netanyahu, this evening , in the former's Jerusalem office, met with children cancer patients in the context of a visit by the Rachashei Lev support center.

Prime Minister and Sara Netanyahu spoke with the children and gave them gift packages and copies of the Book of Psalms. The children told the Prime Minister that they were happy to be his guests and to go from hospital corridors to the corridor of the Prime Minister's Office. The Prime Minister invited them to tour his office, the Cabinet room and the Government Secretariat and gave them a detailed explanation about his office and its work.

A representative of the children, David, thanked Prime Minster and Sara Netanyahu for their hospitality and recalled the children's great excitement three weeks ago when Sara Netanyahu visited them in the oncology ward at The Chaim Sheba Medical Center at Tel Hashomer. On behalf of his friends, David also told the Prime Minister, "You give us great inspiration. We are fighting for our lives and you are fighting for the State of Israel."

Prime Minister Netanyahu told the children, "I wish that you all will visit here again when you get better. We love you and are happy to be with you."

Sara Netanyahu said, "I will continue to visit you in hospital but I hope that you will no longer be there. You have such strength at such a young age. I wish you, with all my heart, a full and speedy recovery."
