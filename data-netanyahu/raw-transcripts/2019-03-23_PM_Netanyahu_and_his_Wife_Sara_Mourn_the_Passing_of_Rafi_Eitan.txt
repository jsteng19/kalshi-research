Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made the following remarks this evening: "My wife Sara and I, together with the people of Israel, mourn the passing of Rafi Eitan. Rafi was among the heroes of the intelligence services of the State of Israel on countless missions on behalf of the security of Israel. He took part in the capture and bringing to justice in Israel and Jerusalem of the infamous Nazi Adolf Eichmann. Over the years he took part in public life, was an Israeli government minister and worked to return Jewish property that was taken during the Holocaust. He was a personal friend of our family. His wisdom, wit and commitment to the people of Israel and our state were without peer. We mourn his passing."
