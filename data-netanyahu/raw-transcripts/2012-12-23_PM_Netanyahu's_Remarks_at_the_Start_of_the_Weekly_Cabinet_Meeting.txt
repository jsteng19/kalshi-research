Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this morning made the following remarks at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting:

"We are simultaneously dealing with three fronts. Today's Cabinet meeting will open with the south, it is quiet there â€“ but we have loose ends to deal with on the home front, with additional grants that we will give to people and communities. By all accounts, the home front was dealt with very successfully in the last operation and later today I will also hold a summary discussion of the home front lessons from Operation Pillar of Defense. Therefore, first of all, we will discuss the continuation of the successful handling of the south.

We have also recently been witness to disturbances and attacks on our forces. Later today, we will visit IDF Central Command in order to closely monitor developments as well as the necessary steps to deal with each possible scenario.

We are also monitoring developments in Syria, where there are dramatic developments almost daily. We are cooperating with the US and, together with the international community, are taking the necessary measures to prepare ourselves for the possibility of far-reaching changes in the regime, with implications for the sensitive weapons systems there."
