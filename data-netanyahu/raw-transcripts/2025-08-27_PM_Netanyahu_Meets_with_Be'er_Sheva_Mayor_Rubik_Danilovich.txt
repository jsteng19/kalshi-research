Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, in his Jerusalem office, met with Be'er Sheva Mayor Rubik Danilovich and said:"We have a deep commitment to strengthening and developing Be'er Sheva, and we intend to define it as a metropolitan area that will be the beating heart of the Negev."

Several issues were raised during the meeting, especially the urgent need to provide a comprehensive response for Soroka Medical Center, which was severely damaged during Operation Rising Lion.

Also discussed was advancing the status of Be'er Sheva as a metropolitan city and restoring its eligibility for tax benefits, a step that will strengthen the socio-economic fabric of the city.

Mayor Danilovich commended the attentiveness shown by Prime Minister Netanyahu and expressed hope that the initiatives that were presented at the meeting would be translated into practical decisions in the near future that will lead to substantive change, with fully cooperation between the city leadership and the government.
