Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today, commented on the data in the National Insurance 2010 poverty report, which indicate a decline in the number of poor in Israel:

"At the outset, my Government set for itself the goal of reducing social gaps and the number of poor in Israel. A main way to reduce gaps and lower the cost-of-living is to participate in the financing of children's education, provide equal opportunities in education and personally invest in students. Implementing the Trajtenberg committee recommendations, as well as instituting a negative income tax, increasing participation in the labor force and continuing to lower unemployment, will further improve the situation for weaker populations in Israel. This is not a simple mission due to the need to implement the changes while maintaining the budgetary framework and without bringing about the collapse of the Israeli economy as happened to strong economies in the world. Just this week, we saw that the Israeli economy is continuing to grow, as a result of the responsible management by all relevant parties."
