Following is an excerpt from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks today at the memorial ceremony for the fallen of the Altalena, at the Nahalat Yitzhak cemetery in Tel Aviv :

"I want to believe that the lessons of the Altalena have been learned and internalized.

Division – is weakness. Unity – is strength.

We are fighting on several fronts:

In the south – until Hamas is eliminated and all of our hostages are returned.

In the north – until we restore all of our residents securely to their homes.

In the east – we are working to prevent Iran from encircling us in a chokehold and from achieving nuclear weapons that are designed to destroy us.

But there is one war that cannot be and must not be – there will be no civil war.

There is an extremist, vocal and – I regret – occasionally violent minority, that is organized and financed on an unimaginable scale.

But it does not represent the majority of our people. Most of the people are behind our fighters who want, and are striving for, victory over our enemies."
