Prime Minister Netanyahu told Rabbi Druckman that, "You helped establish the division for immigrants from the Commonwealth of Independent States and Ethiopia and for IDF soldiers. All of this was in cooperation with Sephardic Chief Rabbi Shlomo Amar. You stood steadfast in the face of crises and criticism of state-sponsored conversion in order to return the lost children. You did all of this in the good spirit of love of the Jewish People."

Rabbi Druckman noted that during his aforesaid tenure, he signed approximately 50,000 conversion certificates.
