Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this afternoon visited the Border Police base in Jerusalem and spoke with Border Police personnel and IDF soldiers who have recently foiled terrorist attacks at Tapuah junction.

Prime Minister Netanyahu told the Border Police personnel and IDF soldiers: "We assign you difficult and complex tasks. You are called upon to maintain security and, at the same time, allow for daily routine, and this puts you in very tough dilemmas. You have proven an amazing ability to uphold both of these tasks simultaneously. Of course, the first mission is to guard your lives and those of Israeli citizens, who are threatened by relentless terrorism and unending attempted terrorist attacks. We know this, it is not over; and signing this or that document does not change it."

Prime Minister Netanyahu added: "We all pray for peace. The Jewish People have been praying for peace every day for thousands of years. Until peace comes, we will continue to strengthen you so that you – Border Police personnel and IDF soldiers – may continue to protect the State of Israel. In the end, this is what ensures our future and in the end, this is what will also bring peace. You are at the forefront against these attacks and I know that you need to make decisions in a second. We have been there. We know it is not easy; therefore, we highly appreciate your accomplishments, because we know what you are called upon to do, and you do so in an exceptional manner. We are very impressed by your resourcefulness and your daring. I congratulate you on these two actions that saved who knows how many Israeli lives. Who knows how many innocents were saved thanks to your resourcefulness?"

Prime Minister Netanyahu told a fighter who was wounded in action: "I know that sometimes it hurts. Know that all of us are binding up your wounds and embracing you among the defenders of Israel."
