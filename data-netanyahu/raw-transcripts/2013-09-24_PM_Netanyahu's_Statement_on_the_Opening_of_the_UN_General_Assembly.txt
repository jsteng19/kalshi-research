Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, made the following statement on the opening of the UN General Assembly:

"I appreciate President Obama's statement that 'Iran's conciliatory words will have to be matched by action that is transparent and verifiable,' and I look forward to discussing this with him in Washington next week.

Iran thinks that soothing words and token actions will enable it to continue on its path to the bomb. Like North Korea before it, Iran will try to remove sanctions by offering cosmetic concessions, while preserving its ability to rapidly build a nuclear weapon at a time of its choosing.

Israel would welcome a genuine diplomatic solution that truly dismantles Iran's capacity to develop nuclear weapons.

But we will not be fooled by half-measures that merely provide a smokescreen for Iran's continual pursuit of nuclear weapons.

And the world should not be fooled either."
