I expect the international community to unequivocally condemn this act of savage murder.

The terrorists murdered a young family, a mother, a father, a boy of 11, a boy of 4, a baby girl of four months.

They all had their throats slit.

They were sleeping in their beds and they were savagely murdered by animals.

The international community that so quickly rushes to condemn Israel over a building here or a building there, for some reason takes it time in condemning this savagery, this brutality, this murder that has no justification.

Something else has to be pointed out.

The Palestinian Authority engages in double talk.

To the world outside they speak peace.

To their own people inside, they teach incitement.

They allow incitement and hatred against Israel, in their schools, in their mosques, in their state controlled media.

This has got to end.

The international community must demand from the Palestinian Authority, an end to incitement.

The Palestinian Authority must stop incitement and begin to educate its people towards peace.

That’s the only way that we’ll have peace.
