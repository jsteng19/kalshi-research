Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today invited to his bureau, a delegation of

Israeli Druze

spiritual and local council leaders, who had demonstrated outside the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem. The representatives thanked the Prime Minister and briefed him on the difficulties facing the Druze community and Druze local councils on various issues.

Prime Minister Netanyahu expressed his special feelings toward them and his deep esteem for their contribution to Israeli society and security. He told those present that he was meeting with them thanks to an Israeli hero, a Druze soldier who had saved his life.

Prime Minister Netanyahu instructed Interior Minister Eli Yishai, Finance Minister Dr. Yuval Steinitz and Prime Minister's Office Director-General Eli Gabai to find a solution for the Druze councils and to assist them as much as possible.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said: "I recognize and appreciate the contribution of the Druze community to the security of the state. I think that we must make an extra effort here, as I did in my first term as Prime Minister. I am aware of the councils' problems and that all of you realize that there is a complicated global crisis that has yet to be resolved. But despite this limitation, we will find the solution. Therefore, I ask that a supreme effort be made to help our brothers; they are our brothers."

Interior Minister Yishai, Deputy Negev and Galilee Development Minister Ayoub Kara, MK Hamad Amar and Prime Minister's Office Dir.-Gen. Gabai also attended the meeting.
