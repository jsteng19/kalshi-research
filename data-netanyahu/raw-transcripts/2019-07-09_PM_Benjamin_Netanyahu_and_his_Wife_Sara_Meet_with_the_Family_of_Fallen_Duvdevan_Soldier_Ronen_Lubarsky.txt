Prime Minister Netanyahu and his wife Sara, at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem, met with the family of the late St.-Sgt. Ronen Lubarsky of the IDF "Duvdevan" unit. Prime Minister Netanyahu wrote a letter in the "Scroll of Voluntarism", a Torah scroll in memory of all fallen "Duvdevan" soldiers and in appreciation of volunteers in the country. The scroll is a joint initiative of the Lubarsky family and the Ruach Gavit non-profit association. Prime Minister Netanyahu: "Today we are finishing the 'Scroll of Voluntarism' in memory of the late Ronen Lubarsky and the other fallen 'Duvdevan' soldiers. 'Duvdevan' is a unit of voluntarism, sacrifice and heroism that guards the security of Israel in unconventional ways, in great difficulty and with supreme heroism. This moment is blessed because it expresses the appreciation of the people and the state. We know that this voluntarism entails great pain for you and the other families. We adopt and embrace you as part of our family. We will continue to do things in memory of the fallen for one simple reason: It is thanks to them that we live, that the state lives and that the state is developing. This is no exaggeration. It is exactly right; therefore, there is nothing better than cherishing their memory in the book of books of our people." The deputy commander of "Duvdevan", the Rabbi of the Commando Brigade and Ronen Lubarsky's commander also attended the meeting.
