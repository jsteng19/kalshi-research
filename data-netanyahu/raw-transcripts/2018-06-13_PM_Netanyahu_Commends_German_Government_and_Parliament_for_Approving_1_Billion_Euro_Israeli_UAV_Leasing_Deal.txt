PM Netanyahu commends the German government and parliament for approving an approximately one billion Euro deal for Germany to lease Israeli UAVs.

PM Netanyahu:

"This is a great contribution to the Israeli security industry and to the Israeli economy. The giant deal is an expression of the strategic partnership between Germany and Israel and attests to the potential of Israeli industry to contribute to countries such as Germany."

Prime Minister Netanyahu has discussed this with German Chancellor Merkel in their previous meetings including last week. The Prime Minister would like to thank the Chancellor for dealing with the issue.
