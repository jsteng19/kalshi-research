Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today:

"I am now being discharged from Hadassah-Ein Kerem Hospital, which had become my office in the past day. We continued to work even from here.

I would like to thank Professor Pikarsky and the wonderful Hadassah-Ein Kerem medical team that successfully operated on my hernia. I would also like to thank the masses of Israeli citizens for sending me your best wishes for recovery. I am recovering; thank you.

Unfortunately, in the past day there was a tragic event in which our forces unintentionally harmed non-combatants in the Gaza Strip. This happens in war. We are conducting a thorough inquiry and are in contact with the governments. We will do everything to prevent a recurrence."
