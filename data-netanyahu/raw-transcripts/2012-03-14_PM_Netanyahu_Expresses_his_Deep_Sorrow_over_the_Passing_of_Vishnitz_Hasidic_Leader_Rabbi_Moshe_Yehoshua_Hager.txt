Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today spoke with Deputy Education Minister MK Menachem Eliezer Moses and expressed his deep sorrow over the passing of Vishnitz hasidic leader and President of the Agudat Yisrael Council of Torah Sages

Rabbi Moshe Yehoshua Hager.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said, "We have lost a dear man, an exemplar, a great leader, one who led one of the largest and most important communities in the Jewish world â€“ Vishnitz Hasidim. He has thousands of students who will carry on his legacy for generations to come. Having devotedly led thousands of people, his passing is a major loss for ultra-orthodox Judaism and for the entire Jewish People."

Prime Minister Netanyahu sends his condolences to the Hager family and to the thousands of hasidim in Israel and around the world.
