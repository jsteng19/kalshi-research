Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this morning in his office, met with reservists' representatives Boaz Nol, Idan Miller, Yoav Kish, Zohara Berger-Tzur and Yotam Berger and told them: "The division of the burden must be changed. What has been is not what will be. This is our second meeting in recent months. I know that there are many hitchhikers who voted to automatically extend the Tal Law. I am not one of them. The Tal Law will be replaced by a more egalitarian and just law, and I will submit it. The new law will also include civilian service for Arabs. This must be done without setting public against public. The change will entail expanding frameworks and increasing budgets. This is high on the list of priorities for the security of the state.
