Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today in cooperation with Communications Minister Moshe Cahlon and Public Diplomacy and Diaspora Affairs Minister Yuli Edelstein, launched the

Inscribing the Tanakh website

(in Hebrew). Amos Rulnick, founder of the Bible Valley non-profit association also attended the event.

Prime Minister Netanyahu chose the first verse for the site: "Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more." (Isaiah 2:4)

Minister Cahlon chose "A Song of Ascents. I will lift up mine eyes unto the mountains: from whence shall my help come?" (Psalms 121:1)

The goal of the project is to restore the

Tanakh

to the entire public and bring its closer to the public at large in Israel. All of its books appear on the site and each person may choose the most significant verse for him or herself and note the reasons for the choice. Upon completing registration, each participant will receive a certificate attesting to his participation.

The launch of the Hebrew website is part of a global project run by the non-profit association, in cooperation with the Foreign Ministry and the Public Diplomacy and Diaspora Affairs Ministry, in the framework of which hundreds of thousands of people from around the world, of all faiths, are copying the Bible in their own hand.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said that he chose Isaiah 2:4 because this was prophets of Israel's goal for the entire world: "While the Tanakh has a universal aspect, it is, first of all, the Jewish People's book of books. The Tanakh conquers with its ideals, faith and unique character. No other book can compare to it. We hope that one day peace will prevail among all nations and nation will not lift up sword against nation."
