Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is due to undergo surgery for a hernia overnight at Hadassah Hospital-Ein Karem in Jerusalem. In wake of pain that the Prime Minister felt during the day, he was examined by his personal physician Dr. Tzvi Berkowitz and by surgeon Prof. Aryeh Durst. The preliminary diagnosis, confirmed by a CT scan at the hospital, was a hernia; it was decided to have surgery overnight. The operation is due to last approximately one hour, under a local anesthetic, although there is the possibility that general anesthesia may be decided upon. The surgery will be performed by a medical team led by Surgery Dept. Chief Prof. Aviram Nissan and Prof. Durst. Prime Minister Netanyahu is due to be discharged this afternoon, Sunday, 11 August 2013.

The weekly Cabinet meeting, originally scheduled for 11:00 this morning, is postponed until further notice. Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon will chair the meeting of the ministerial committee on prisoners' affairs.
