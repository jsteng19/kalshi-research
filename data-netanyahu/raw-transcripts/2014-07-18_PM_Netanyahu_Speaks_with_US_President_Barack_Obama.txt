Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening, spoke with US President Barack Obama. During their conversation a siren was heard as a result of missile fire from Gaza to Israel and the Prime Minister explained that this was the reality in which millions of Israelis have been living recently.

Prime Minister Netanyahu told US President Obama that Hamas was using the residents of Gaza as human shields, as was seen yesterday when munitions were discovered in a UN school in Gaza, and added that, therefore, Hamas was responsible for injuries to the residents of Gaza.

Prime Minister Netanyahu thanked US President Obama for America's support of Israel's right to defend itself and for the partnership in developing the Iron Dome system.
