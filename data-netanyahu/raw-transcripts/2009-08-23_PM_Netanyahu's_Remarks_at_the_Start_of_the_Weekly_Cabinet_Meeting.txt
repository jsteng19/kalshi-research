Following are excerpts from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting today:

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu salutes Israel's Muslim citizens and Israel's neighbors on the start of the month of Ramadan. "The Ramadan holiday is a month of fast and prayers; prayers which are shared by us and our Muslim neighbors, to achieve peace and prosperity and security between us and them and the entire Middle East."

Prime Minister Netanyahu expressed his intention in the upcoming period, together with the relevant ministers, to invest efforts to increasing equal opportunities for Israeli citizens in the non-Jewish sectors.

The Prime Minister drew attention to the wave of violence and murders which has afflicted Israel in recent weeks.

"I would like to express my appreciation to the Israel Police who solved most of the incidents, if not all of them, promptly. I believe that this work is professional and testifies to a very high capability."

Prime Minister Netanyahu also outlined two courses of Government action: Increasing punishments, and promoting a municipal police force.
