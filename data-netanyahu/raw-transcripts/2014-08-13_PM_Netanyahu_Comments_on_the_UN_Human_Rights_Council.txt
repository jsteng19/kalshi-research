Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in his Jerusalem office, following his meeting with New York Governor Andrew M. Cuomo

"The UN Human Rights Council gives legitimacy to murderous terrorist organizations such as Hamas and ISIS. Instead of inquiring into Hamas's attacks on Israeli civilians and its use of the residents of Gaza as human shields and instead of inquiring into the massacres that Assad is perpetrating against the Syrian people or that ISIS is perpetrating against the Kurds, the UN has decided to come and check Israel – the only democracy in the Middle East, a democracy which is acting legitimately to defend its citizens against murderous terrorism. The report of this committee has already been written. The committee chairman has already decided that Hamas is not a terrorist organization; therefore, they have nothing to look for here. They should visit Damascus, Baghdad and Tripoli; they should go see ISIS, the Syrian army and Hamas – there they will find war crimes, not here."
