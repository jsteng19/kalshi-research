Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, held a Zoom conversation with United Arab Emirates (UAE) Jewish community leaders: "This is a very great day for the State of Israel and the Jewish people. We are at the dawn of a historic era of peace for peace, of peace between Israel and the UAE, of peace that has expanded between Israel and the Arab world. This peace is good for the State of Israel, good for our people and good for all people in the region. I hope to visit you soon, this year. If we overcome the corona pandemic by then, I will also be prepared to shake your hand. Thank you and many blessings from Jerusalem." UAE Jewish community Chief Rabbi Yehuda Sarna, Dubai Jewish Community President Ross Kriel, Dubai Community Center president Solly Wolf and Chabad emissary in Dubai Rabbi Levi Duchman participated in the conversation.
