Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem, met with representatives of hostages' families and bereaved families from the Heroism forum and the Hope forum.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"The idea that we will halt the war before achieving all of its goals is out of the question. We will enter Rafah and we will eliminate the Hamas battalions there â€“ with or without a deal, in order to achieve the total victory."

The Prime Minister listened to their call to continue achieving the goals of the war and to withstand the international pressure.
