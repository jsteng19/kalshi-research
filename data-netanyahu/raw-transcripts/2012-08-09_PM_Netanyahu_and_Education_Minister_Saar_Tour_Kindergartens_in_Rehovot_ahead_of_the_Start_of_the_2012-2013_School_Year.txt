Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Education Minister Gideon Saar, toured new kindergartens that were built ahead of the opening of the school year as part of the implementation of the law on free education from age 3.

Education Minister Saar updated Prime Minister Netanyahu that in the coming school year approximately 270,000 children, aged 3-4, approximately 85% of the age bracket, will be eligible for free education, which will save NIS 800 per child per month. The Prime Minister was also informed that 800 kindergartens and 910 teachers have been added.

During the visit, Prime Minister Netanyahu met with children and parents and told them: "A savings of NIS 800 a month for 270,000 children is huge. It not only makes things easier on the wallet, it also provides equality of opportunity and the ability to start earlier in order to reach higher. We are effecting a revolution in education, from the roots to the top, from kindergarten to higher education."

Education Minister Saar said: "The investment in free education for ages 3-4 is historic in scope. Today, we are removing a second mortgage from the shoulders of young families in Israel â€“ NIS 800 a month, NIS 8,000 a year. For 27 years, governments have been making excuses as to why they were not implementing a law on free education from age 3. This Government made a decision in January of this year and we will act determinedly in order to meet the needs of the definitive majority of children in its first year of implementation."
