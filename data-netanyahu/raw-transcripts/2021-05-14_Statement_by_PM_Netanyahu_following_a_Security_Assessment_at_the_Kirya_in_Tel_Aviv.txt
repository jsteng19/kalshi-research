Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this afternoon, at the Kirya in Tel Aviv, following an assessment of the situation with the security leadership: "I said that we would strike Hamas and the other terrorist organizations very hard – and we are doing just that. In the last 24 hours, we have attacked underground targets. Hamas thought that it could hide there but it cannot hide there. Its senior officials think that they can flee from our strikes -- they cannot flee. We will reach them everywhere, all of these people, and we will continue to do so. They attacked us on our holiday. They attacked our capital. They launched missiles at our cities. They are paying, and will pay, a very heavy price for this. This is not yet over. We will do everything to restore security to our cities and our people. I would like to say a word of appreciation to my friend President Biden and to other friends – the President of France, the British Prime Minister, the Chancellor of Austria, the Chancellor of Germany and others. They have upheld our natural and self-evident right to defend ourselves, to act in self-defense against these terrorists who both attack civilians and hide behind civilians. This will not help them and we will continue to take action."
