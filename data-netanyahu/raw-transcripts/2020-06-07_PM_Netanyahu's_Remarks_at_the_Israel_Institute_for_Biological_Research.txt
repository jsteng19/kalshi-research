Prime Minister Netanyahu visited the Israel Institute for Biological Research (IIBR) in Nes Ziona. Following are his remarks:

"For years we have been prepared to defend the State of Israel against existential or very major threats. Now there are two possibilities, either we find a vaccine, or we do not find a vaccine – at least not in the coming years. If you find a vaccine you will have brought to the people of Israel, who have shown great resilience, an amazing thing, but you will have brought this for humanity as well. I think that there is no more important mission than that which you are involved in at the moment.

In the absence of a vaccine, we will need to find other solutions to enable routine life that allows for a reasonable economy. A reasonable economy is one that grows by at least 2%. Otherwise we will be in continual regression.

I would focus on the major efforts to find a vaccine but at the same time I would also promote other things that enable us to move forward on testing, rapid testing and antibody carriers to reach a situation in which we can allow the population of Israel, apparently the entire population, to function in the absence of a vaccine. These are two missions and if you need to choose one – a vaccine. But if you are able to advance both at the same time – then do so. I tell you this because you carry all of the hopes of the citizens of Israel and of the State of Israel."Defense Minister and Alternate Prime Minister Benny Gantz, Health Minister Yuli Edelstein, National Security Council head Meir Ben-Shabbat and IIBR Director General Prof. Shmuel Shapira also participated in the visit.
