Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening: "We are in the midst of an important and in-depth discussion in the Corona Cabinet and it will go on for several more hours because the issue is very complex. I want to make certain that we will continue to make the right decisions, with as broad agreement as possible, in order to allow us to open up the economy and education without endangering the lives and health of the citizens of Israel. We have lowered morbidity to one of the lowest rates in the west, and I do not intend to give this up with a wave of the hand. I need your cooperation, citizens of Israel."
