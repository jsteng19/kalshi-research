Prime Minister Netanyahu will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on 21 February 2019, in continuation of their 11 November 2018 meeting in Paris.

Prime Minister Netanyahu (at his meeting with Austrian President Alexander Van der Bellen):

"I’ll be going on February 21st again to Russia following my discussions with President Putin in Paris a few months ago and subsequent phone conversations. It’s very important that we continue to prevent Iran from entrenching in Syria. In many ways we’ve blocked that advance and we’re committed to continue blocking it, preventing Iran from creating another warfront against us, right here opposite the Golan Heights. This is the main subject I will be discussing with President Putin."
