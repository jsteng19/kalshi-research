Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made the following remarks after the Likud Knesset faction meeting today:

"The events on the Syrian border did not happen by mere chance but, rather, are an attempt to heat up the border and breach our borders.

The struggle is not over June 5 1967 but over May 15 1948; this argument is over the very establishment of the State of Israel.

The Arab assault on the State of Israel in 1948 created two – not one – refugee problems – the Palestinian refugees and the Jewish refugees of similar numbers. Tiny Israel absorbed all of the Jewish refugees who were expelled from the Arab countries but the Arab world failed to resolve the issue of the Arab refugees. Now, the great-grandchildren of those Palestinian refugees come and seek to flood the State of Israel and breach its borders. There is neither justice, nor logic nor hope in this but, rather, an attempt to perpetuate a fantasy that would endanger the peace of the region.

We must defend our borders like any other country. The IDF acted in accordance with international law. We warned that we would defend our borders. We passed warnings to neighboring countries. The IDF operated according to clear orders. We issued repeated warnings on the ground. The firing was the last resort after all other possibilities had been exhausted.

I regret that I cannot tell you that the Syrian government did its utmost to prevent provocations. It allowed these people to create provocations and challenge Israel's sovereignty. This was an attempt to divert international attention away from what is happening inside Syria, including the harsh events in Hama.

We insist on our right to defend our borders, our communities and our citizens. We will do so with maximum restraint and responsibility."
