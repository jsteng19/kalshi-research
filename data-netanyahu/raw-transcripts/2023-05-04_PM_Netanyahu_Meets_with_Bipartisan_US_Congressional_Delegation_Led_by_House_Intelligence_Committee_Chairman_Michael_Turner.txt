Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem, met with a bipartisan US Congressional delegation led by House of Representatives Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Chairman Michael Turner (R-OH). In response to a question about Iran, Prime Minister Netanyahu said: "Iran is 50 North Koreas. It is not merely a neighborhood bully like the, the dynasty that rules North Korea. This is an ideological force that views us, Israel, as the small Satan, and views you as the Great Satan. To have Iran being able to threaten every city in the United States with nuclear blackmail is a changing of history." Prime Minister Netanyahu thanked the Congresspeople for their broad support of Israel from both sides of the aisle.
