Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed his condolences on the passing of Yossi Sarid:

"Yossi Sarid had a unique voice in Israeli politics; he was opinionated and sharp. Even though we disagreed on many issues, I appreciated his devotion to his path, his broad knowledge and the meticulous Hebrew with which he spoke and wrote. He will also be remembered as an outstanding parliamentarian, a veteran member of the [Knesset] Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee and a minister of education who sought to advance the education system in Israel."
