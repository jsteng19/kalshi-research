Prime Minister Netanyahu, this evening: "There is good news on the coronavirus front: The day before yesterday I spoke with Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel, and yesterday I spoke with Moderna Chief Medical Officer Tal Zaks, about signing to increase the number of doses that will be allocated to the citizens of Israel. I believe that we are on the verge of signing. This is excellent news. This is in addition to the fact that Pfizer, with which we have already signed for eight million doses, is going to apply for approval with the US medical authorities in a few days, to supply these vaccines. We will be among the first to receive them. This is the beginning of the end of the coronavirus."
