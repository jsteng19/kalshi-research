Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today, sent his condolences to Czech Ambassador to Israel Tomas Pojar on the passing of former Czech President Vaclav Havel:

"On behalf of the Government and people of Israel, I would like to express our condolences to the Havel family and to the Czech people on the passing of Vaclav Havel.

President Havel was a brave and strong voice against totalitarianism and an inspiration to those fighting for freedom around the world. After leading the Velvet Revolution, Havel led the peaceful establishment of the Czech Republic's democratic government, and resumed the deep friendship between the Czech and Israeli peoples. He was a true friend of Israel and in recent years, acted along with other world leaders to defend Israel against attempts to delegitimize the only state of the Jewish People. We will all miss his courage and his faith in the justice of his path."
