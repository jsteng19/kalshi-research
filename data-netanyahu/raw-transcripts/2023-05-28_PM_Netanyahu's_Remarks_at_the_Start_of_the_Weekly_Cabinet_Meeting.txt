Following are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks [translated from Hebrew] at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting, today: "Last week, we passed the bi-annual budget and the Arrangements Law. This is important for economic stability and the fight against the cost of living. This is a first step. I have instructed the Cabinet Secretary to submit – at the next Cabinet meeting – a draft decision to establish a ministerial committee on the fight against the cost of living. I will head this committee, together with the Finance Minister, the Economy Minister, additional ministers and professionals. I request that the ministerial committee submit to me a working plan, with a clear and detailed timetable, on the fight against the cost of living with all means including encouraging investment, lowering customs and breaking monopolies. The fight against the cost of living tops our government's list of national priorities. We will take determined and strong action to lower prices in all areas. I am convinced if we work together, together with the budget we passed, along with the reforms in the Arrangements Law, we will succeed in stemming the cost of living and in assisting all citizens of Israel. Moreover, today we will establish a ministerial committee to deal with the needs of the Ethiopian community in Israel. This is in continuation of the ministerial committees that I established under the governments in which I served as Prime Minister, which focused on the needs of the community and which led to important achievements. I am aware that there are additional challenges but this committee is the tool to continue advancing our brothers and sisters from the Ethiopian community in Israel. I know that it will receive the cooperation of all ministries as has been the case up until now."
