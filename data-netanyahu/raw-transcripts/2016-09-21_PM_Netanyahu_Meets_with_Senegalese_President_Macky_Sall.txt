Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with Senegalese President Macky Sall.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu:

"I am very pleased to see you. [Translated from French]."

"Of course we have great relations between Senegal and Israel and we will make them greater. We think that since President Senghor came to Israel there has not been, I believe, another visit so you are officially invited to come to visit Israel and I hope to be able to reciprocate one day in Senegal." [Transcribed in English]

Senegalese President Macky Sall:

"That is why I am here, to see you. As you know, Senegal is a very open country and we think we can work together. I invite you to visit Senegal and I will certainly come to Israel." [Transcribed in English]
