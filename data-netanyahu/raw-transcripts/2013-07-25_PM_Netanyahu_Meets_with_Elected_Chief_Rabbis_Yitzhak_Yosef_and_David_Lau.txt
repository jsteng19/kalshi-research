Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this afternoon, in his Tel Aviv office, met with elected chief rabbis Yitzhak Yosef and David Lau, and said at the start of the meeting: "In accordance with the verse 'Love your neighbor as yourself', I congratulate you with all my heart. You are the rabbis of all Israel. You are the rabbis for the non-observant public that needs your help, your patience and your tolerance. Work for the unity of Israel and for the love of Israel."

Prime Minister Netanyahu invited the chief rabbis to participate in the Tanakh study circle named after his late father-in-law Shmuel Ben-Artzi.

Rabbi Lau was accompanied by his father, former Chief Rabbi Yisrael Meir Lau. Prime Minister Netanyahu asked Rabbi Yosef to convey his best wishes for good health to his father, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef.
