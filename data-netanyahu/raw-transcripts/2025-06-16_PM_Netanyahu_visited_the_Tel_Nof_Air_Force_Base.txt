Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the Tel Nof Air Force Base: "The Israeli Air Force controls the skies over Tehran. We strike regime targets, as opposed to the criminal Iranian regime which targets civilians."

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today  visited the Tel Nof Air Force Base, together with Defense Minister Israel Katz and IDF Chief-of-Staff Lt.-Gen. Eyal Zamir.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"On behalf of the people of Israel and the State of Israel, you are doing amazing things. The Israeli Air Force controls the skies over Tehran. This changes the entire campaign.

We are on the way to achieving our two objectives: Eliminating the nuclear threat and eliminating the missile threat. When we control the skies over Tehran, we strike regime targets, as opposed to the criminal Iranian regime which targets our civilians and comes to kill women and children. We tell the people of Tehran to evacuate – and we act.

We are on the way to achieving victory, and it is being achieved thanks to our heroic pilots, and our magnificent ground crews who are also doing amazing work. I salute you. All citizens of Israel salute you. I would like to tell you that many people around the world also salute you and are impressed by you."

Defense Minister Katz:

"As the Prime Minister, the Government and I needed to make the decisions whether or not to attack Iran, and these decisions are not simple ones, we knew one thing, and that tipped the balance: When the decision is made, we have whom we can rely on – you, those who know how to bring results. We now see that you lead together, and what is happening in the skies over Tehran, and we see that we were right. We had those whom we could rely on. We have those whom we can rely on. The entire State of Israel and the people of Israel rely on you and tell you: 'Thank you and keep going.'"
