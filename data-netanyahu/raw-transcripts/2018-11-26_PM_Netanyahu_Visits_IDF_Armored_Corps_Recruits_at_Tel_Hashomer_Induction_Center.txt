Prime Minister and Defense Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this morning, at the IDF induction center at Tel Hashomer, visited IDF Armored Corps recruits. GOC Personnel Maj.-Gen. Motti Almoz and other senior officers briefed the Prime Minister on personnel in the IDF.

Prime Minister Netanyahu then held an open conversation with the recruits:

"We know that the supreme goal of the military is, first of all, to defend our state, and if it is forced on us, to be victorious in war. You are joining generations of fighters who wrought miracles and wonders. The entire world admires the IDF and does so, not just because of the technology and tools, but because of the personnel.

In the end, you are victorious not only by being defensive; you are victorious by being on the attack. Our long, strong ground attack arm is the Armored Corps, and you have the great privilege of leading this force.

As Prime Minister, what concerns me is the fact that I know there are no free wars and no free battles. There is always a cost and the cost is very dear and I always think about the cost.

When war is inevitable, we will use all force and all strength and will do so in the best way possible."

In response to a recruit's question 'What is it like to be Prime Minister of Israel?':

"It is a very great responsibility because we know that we are entrusted – as you are entrusted with one component of security – with the IDF, which is the foundation of security. The first mission of the Prime Minister of Israel is to see to the security of the state. In the end it is a great responsibility and a great privilege."
