Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, visited an IDF Intelligence base, together with Minister Ron Dermer; his Military Secretary, Maj.-Gen. Roman Gofman; National Security Council Director Tzachi Hanegbi; and the Head of IDF Intelligence, Maj.-Gen. Shlomi Binder.

Prime Minister Netanyahu [translated from Hebrew]:

"I am here at an IDF Intelligence base with the Head of IDF Intelligence, and with our amazing people, the soldiers, both conscripts and reservists, who are doing sacred work in providing us with the intelligence that wins wars.

I cannot exaggerate the importance of the work that has been done, and which is being done at the moment, in achieving the total victory.

Head of IDF Intelligence, thank you very much. For myself, the citizens of Israel and the Government of Israel, please convey my gratitude to everyone."
