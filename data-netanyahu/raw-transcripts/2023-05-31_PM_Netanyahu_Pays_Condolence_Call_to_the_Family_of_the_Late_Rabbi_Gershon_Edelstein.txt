Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, paid a condolence call in Bnei Brak to the family of the late Rabbi Gershon Edelstein, the leader of the Lithuanian public, President of the Degel Hatorah Council of Torah Sages, and President of the Vaad Hayeshivot. Prime Minister Netanyahu told the family and students of Rabbi Edelstein: "This is a very great loss. He made a very great impression on me. This is not lip service on my part; he spoke from the depths of his heart about his commitment to education. I think he saw it as the basis for everything." The Prime Minister added: "A man of his stature, it was a privilege to talk with him. Every minute you, his students, were with him was a great privilege. With G-d's help, you should not know any more sorrow."
