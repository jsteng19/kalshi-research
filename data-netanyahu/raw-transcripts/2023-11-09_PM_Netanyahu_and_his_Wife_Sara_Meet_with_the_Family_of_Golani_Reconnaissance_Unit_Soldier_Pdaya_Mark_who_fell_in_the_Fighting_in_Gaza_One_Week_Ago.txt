Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara, met with the family of Golani Reconnaissance Unit Soldier Pdaya Mark, who fell in the fighting in Gaza one week ago. They listened to the members of his family who described Pdaya's unique and inspiring personality, offered the family their support, and conveyed their condolences over the terrible loss. The Prime Minister shared with them how he has coped with bereavement after the loss of his brother Yoni.

Sara Netanyahu said that the letter that Pdaya Mark sent to his family showed his great spirit and faith, after his late cousin Elhanan fell in battle on the outbreak of the war.

Family members said that even if Pdaya had known the end of the story, he would have entered Gaza and done everything. They added that while he has been taken, Hamas will never be able to take his spirit.

Prime Minister Netanyahu responded [translated from Hebrew]:

"The faith and strength, and with everything that your family has endured and that you are enduring today, this is the challenge for the people of Israel. The land of Israel is acquired by tribulations. The pain is very great but we will win thanks to this spirit."

Prime Minister Netanyahu met Pdaya Mark four months ago at IDF Training Base #1, when the latter completed the officers; course.
