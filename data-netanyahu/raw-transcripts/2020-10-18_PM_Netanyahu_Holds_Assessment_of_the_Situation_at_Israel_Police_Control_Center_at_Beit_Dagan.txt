Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening , held an assessment of the situation at the Israel Police control center at Beit Dagan, together with Public Security Minister Amir Ohana and Acting Police Inspector General Motti Cohen.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said that enforcement and fines in red cities had to be stepped up and that the cordons around them had to be tightened.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"We are in a very major effort to continue the great success of the lockdown. We want the rules to be followed throughout the country. I am aware of the fact that we are still faced with a considerable challenge.

First, we need to prevent the trickle of morbidity from the red cities. There are not many left. The number is down. This is a result of the rules being honored.

Now I call on all public leaders, on the ultra-orthodox public, to follow the rules and to see to it that they are honored. Enforcement needs to be carried out in any case. Stepping up this enforcement includes ensuring that the lockdowns are tight and that within the cities we are imposing fines as necessary.

I would be pleased if this could be done with volunteers and mutual understanding because our goal is to look after all citizens of Israel without exception. To this end we need both enforcement and an information campaign, both discipline and the important work that the police are doing under difficult conditions. We are mainly concentrating on lockdowns and fines. There is still work to do.

The most important thing is that everyone understands that we are working for the health of all citizens of Israel and we will achieve this only by increased discipline."
