Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today:

"To all the prophets of economic doom, the Israeli stock market is the strongest in the world.

The shekel has strengthened. The deficit has shrunk despite the war and foreign investments in research and development are the highest in the world after the US. Investing in Israel is the smart thing to do.

What we will continue to do is increase investments in weapons production so as not to be dependent on weak Western European leaders who surrender to the radical Islamic minorities in their countries, and this is exactly what we are doing."
