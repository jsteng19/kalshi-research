Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this evening visited the Sarona Market, the scene of yesterday's terrorist attack in Tel Aviv and made the following remarks:

"Four innocent Israelis were murdered here yesterday. We mourn their deaths. I personally know what a great shock their families are going through. Our hearts are with them and we wish a recovery for the wounded.

This is a strong people. They will not defeat us. I see that life is returning to normal around us and that it is good.

Today I convened the Security Cabinet. We decided on a series of vigorous steps: We have cordoned off Yatta. We caught the man who cooperated with the murderers and revoked the work permits of hundreds of members of their clan. We also revoked the easing of restrictions for Ramadan regarding visits to Israel by tens of thousands. We have reinforced units on the seam line and here in Tel Aviv and we decided to take additional measures that I will not detail here.

I heard and appreciate the sharp and unequivocal condemnations of this abhorrent murder from leading world capitals. I have not heard such a condemnation from the Palestinian Authority. But I did hear shouts of joy in Gaza and in other parts of the Palestinian society in Judea and Samaria. This merely reminds us who and what we are dealing with.

We will win."
