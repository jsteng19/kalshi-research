Prime Minister Netanyahu will also visit Expo 2015 in Milan, which is focused on agro technology and food, joining a long list of world leaders who have already done so, including – inter alia – German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the presidents of France, Russia, Austria, Ireland, Mexico and Colombia.
