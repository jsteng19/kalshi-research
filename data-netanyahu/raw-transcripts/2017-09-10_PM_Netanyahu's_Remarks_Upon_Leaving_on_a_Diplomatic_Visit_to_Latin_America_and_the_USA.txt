Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made the following remarks upon leaving on a diplomatic visit to Latin America and the US: "We are now leaving on an historic visit; this is the first time that a sitting Prime Minister is traveling to South America and Central America. We will start our visit in Argentina. I asked the families of the Foreign Ministry employees, who perished in the major terrorist attack in Buenos Aires, to join me. From there we will continue to Colombia and then to Mexico. I spoke this evening with the President of Mexico, a very moving conversation, and I told him that Israel is ready to render all the assistance at our disposal. He very much appreciated this and we decided, of course, to continue our conversation later in the week. From Mexico I will go to the US to address the UN General Assembly and also meet with my friend President Donald Trump.

[English]I look forward to our meeting, to my meeting with President Trump, my friend, in the United States, in New York, and I want to take this opportunity to wish all our friends in the United States that they emerge safe and sound from these difficult times. This storm too shall pass and every citizen of Israel is praying for the safety of the citizens of the United States of America."
