PM Netanyahu commented on the destruction of two Gaza terrorist tunnels:

"Last night the IDF destroyed two terrorist tunnels. Our policy is to take determined action against any attempt to attack us and to systematically eliminate the infrastructure of terrorist tunnels and thus we will continue.

The time has come for the international community to realize that the assistance funds to Gaza are being buried underground."
