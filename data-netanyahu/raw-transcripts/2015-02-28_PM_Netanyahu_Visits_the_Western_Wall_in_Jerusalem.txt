Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening, on the eve of his departure for the US, visited the Western Wall in Jerusalem, and made the following remarks:

"On the eve my trip to the US, I came here to the Western Wall. I would like to take this opportunity to say that I respect US President Barack Obama. I believe in the strength of the relationship between Israel and the US and in their strength to overcome differences of opinion, those that have been and those that will yet be. As Prime Minister of Israel, it is my obligation to see to the security of Israel; therefore, we strongly oppose the agreement being formulated with Iran and the major powers, which could endanger our very existence. In the face of this danger we must unite and also explain the dangers stemming from this agreement, to Israel, to the region and to the world."
