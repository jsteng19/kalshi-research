Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with National Security Council personnel ahead of Israel's 67th Independence Day. The Prime Minister said: "One of the main missions of the Jewish People over the generations has been to identify threats and dangers in time and deal with them. This is a main task of the National Security Council. I thank all of you for fulfilling this mission."

National Security Council Chairman Yossi Cohen said, "Our national duty is to maintain the strength we have achieved in 67 years of independence and the moral legitimacy of that strength â€“ militarily, economically and diplomatically, all of these are vital to our future."
