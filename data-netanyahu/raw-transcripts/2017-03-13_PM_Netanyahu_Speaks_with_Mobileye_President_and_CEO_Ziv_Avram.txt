Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today spoke by telephone with Mobileye President and CEO Ziv Aviram and congratulated him on the largest deal in the history of Israel, which is a source of Israeli pride.

Aviram told Prime Minister Netanyahu that the center of the company's operations would remain in Israel, that the company would build a global development center in the country, and that it would be responsible for Intel's international activity regarding autonomous vehicles.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"The deal dramatically proves that the vision which we are leading is being realized. Israel is becoming a global technology center not just in cyber but in the automotive sector as well."
