We just completed the return of the first of our hostages: children, their mothers and additional women. Each of them is an entire world.

But I emphasize to you, the families, and to you, citizens of Israel: we are committed to returning all the hostages.

This is one of the aims of the war and we are committed to achieving all the aims of the war.
