Pime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met today, in his office, with the winner of the 2011 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Prof. Dan Shechtman.

Prime Minister Netanyahu asked Prof. Shechtman to teach him about the research that won him the prestigious prize. The latter took a marker and did so on a whiteboard. Technion President Peretz Lavie, Education Minister Gideon Saar and Science and Technology Minister Rabbi Prof. Daniel Hershkovitz – a former dean of the mathematics faculty at the Technion, and who officiated at the wedding of one of Prof. Shechtman's children – were also present.

Prime Minister Netanyahu told Prof. Shechtman that he promises that many other Israelis will yet win Nobel Prizes in the various fields thanks to the Government's investments in education. The Prime Minister noted that in the framework of the bi-annual budget, the Government approved an additional NIS 7.5 billion for higher education. At the initiative of the Prime Minister, and in cooperation with Education Minister Saar and Science and technology Minister Hershkovitz, four centers of excellence have been opened, at various universities, in order to aid in the return of ex-pat scientists. Another six such centers are expected to open.

Prime Minister Netanyahu also referred to the results of recent national exams in which primary school students scored their highest marks in science.

Prime Minister Netanyahu noted that the Government has approved a year's free tuition for discharged soldiers who study in the periphery, and added that a new medical school will open later this month in Safed.

Professor Shechtman gave Prime Minister Netanyahu a necktie emblazoned with the structure of quasi-crystals, which the Technion had made last year on the former's birthday in anticipation of the Nobel Prize.
