Following is an excerpt from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks in the Knesset:

"Even over the weekend, as Iran continued to receive more and more concessions at the negotiating table, Iranian President Rouhani led a march of hatred in the streets of Tehran in which the masses cried, 'Death to America! Death to Israel!'." If the concessions continued even after these unequivocal calls for the destruction of those conducting the negotiations, it seems that there are those who are ready to make an agreement at any price – and this bad agreement is unavoidable.

In any case, we never committed ourselves to preventing an agreement, certainly not one that the major powers are ready to sign at any price. We did commit ourselves to prevent Iran from arming itself with nuclear weapons – and indeed, were it not for our efforts over the years, Iran would already be able to develop atomic bombs.

Our commitment is to prevent Iran from arming itself with nuclear weapons and it is valid today more than ever. I call on all those who care about Israel's security to unite behind this commitment."
