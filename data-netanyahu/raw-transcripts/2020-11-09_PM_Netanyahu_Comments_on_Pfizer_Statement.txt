Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, on the update from Pfizer:

"Today is a very important day in the global struggle against the coronavirus. Pfizer announced that a vaccine that is developing has an efficacy of 90%. In my estimation, several other companies are also advancing toward this goal. We are also advancing with our vaccine; it will take more time.

However, one thing is clear. Not long from today, it will not be years but months, there will be vaccines that will be available for the population of the world. My goal at the moment is to do one thing – bring vaccines to you, citizens of Israel, and we will do so.

This means that the end is in view. I said a few days ago that I see light at the end of the tunnel. I think that train is already exiting the tunnel.

Then let us cooperate; we will maintain – at the moment – a low level of morbidity. Let us not exact prices that are too high vis-à-vis human lives and your health. We can cooperate to maintain health and the economy until the vaccines arrive – and they will."
