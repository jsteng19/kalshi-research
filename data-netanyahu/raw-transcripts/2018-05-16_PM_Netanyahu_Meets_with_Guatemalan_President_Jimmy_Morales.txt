PM Netanyahu, at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem, met with Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales in the framework of an expanded working lunch.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"This is a great day for Israel. This is a great day for Guatemala. I welcome my friend President Jimmy Morales. Guatemala was with us at the beginning and Guatemala is with us today, and we welcome the opening of the embassy in Jerusalem. Thank you my friend. We stood here six or seven months ago and I told you 'Let us open an embassy here' and you have done so. I very much appreciate it."

Guatemalan President Morales:

"It is also a great honor for us to be here, as representatives of Guatemala, in this beautiful city. We spoke on the steps and mentioned how much we want to strengthen relations between us and today we have returned our embassy to Jerusalem. This is indeed a new era in relations between us. We need to support each other vis-Ã -vis our needs and where we can help each other."
