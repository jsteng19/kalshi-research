Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara in Budapest, visited the Shoes on the Danube Bank memorial dedicated to Jews who were shot during the Holocaust and thrown into the river. The Prime Minister placed a stone that he had brought with him from Mt. Herzl in Jerusalem; MK Yisrael Eichler read a chapter from the Book of Psalms.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"This place tragically, yet sharply, expresses the change in the fate of the Jews. Here is where thousands of Jews – including children – were cast into the river.

I have brought a stone from Mt. Herzl – Herzl, who led t the revival of Israel, having been born in this city – in the State of Israel, in memory of the victims here. It symbolizes the revival of Israel and our total commitment that such a disaster should never befall us again.

This is the truest and deepest significance of the State of Israel. I am proud and moved to stand here and say this, out of the deeply-held conviction that characterizes us all, citizens of the State of Israel, children of the Jewish People."
