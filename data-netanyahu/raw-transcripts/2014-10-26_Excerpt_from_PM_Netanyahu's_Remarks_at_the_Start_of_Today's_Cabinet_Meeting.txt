Following is an excerpt from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting, today:

"Recently, and today as well, we are reinforcing Jerusalem with approximately 1,000 Israel Police and Border Police personnel, including from special units. We will not allow the reality of Jerusalem to become one of throwing stones and firebombs, and disturbances. This is not coincidental. Islamic extremist elements are trying to set alight the capital of Israel and we will use all necessary force, with determination and responsibility, so that they are unsuccessful. I expect broad support here from all citizens of Israel in order to guard over the capital of Israel.

Today, we are also marking the start of the academic year. We have invested many billions in higher education in order to ensure that 'the lost decade', as it is called, is behind us, and that the decade before us will be one of success, prosperity and research on behalf of all Israeli students.

I think that our guiding principle may be summarized in two words â€“ Zionism and excellence. These two values guide all of our education systems, certainly higher education, and I wish our students great success."
