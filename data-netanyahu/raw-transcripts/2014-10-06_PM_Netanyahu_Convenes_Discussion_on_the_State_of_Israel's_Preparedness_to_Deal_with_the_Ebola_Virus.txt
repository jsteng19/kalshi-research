Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this afternoon, in his Jerusalem office, convened a discussion on the State of Israel's preparedness for dealing with the Ebola virus. Health Minister Yael German, Transportation and Road Safety Minister Yisrael Katz and Deputy Interior Minister Fania Kirshenbaum – as well as representatives of the Israel Police, Airports Authority and the Foreign Ministry – participated in the discussion.

Health Ministry officials presented the current global situation regarding the spread and transmission of the Ebola virus. It was noted that the countries in which there is the greatest concern over the spread of Ebola are Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. Accordingly, it was decided to increase efforts to locate persons entering Israel from those countries; the Foreign Ministry and the Health Ministry have urged Israelis to avoid traveling to them.

Foreign Ministry Director General Nissim Ben-Shetrit updated those in attendance on the decision to send three mobile clinics to the affected areas in western Africa.
