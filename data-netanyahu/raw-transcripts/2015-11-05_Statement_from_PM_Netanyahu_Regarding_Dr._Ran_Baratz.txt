Prime Minister Benjamin, today, released the following statement:

"I have just read Dr. Ran Baratz's posts on the Internet, including those relating to the President of the State of Israel, the President of the United States and other public figures in Israel and the United States. Those posts are totally unacceptable and in no way reflect my positions or the policies of the Government of Israel. Dr. Baratz has apologized and has asked to meet me to clarify the matter following my return to Israel."

Dr. Ran Baratz:

"I apologize for the hurtful remarks I posted on the Internet about the President of the State of Israel, the President of the United States and other public figures in Israel and the United States. I'm sorry that I didn't inform the Prime Minister in advance about them. These postings were written hastily and sometimes humorously, in a manner appropriate for a private person writing on the Internet. It is clear to me that in a government position one must act and express oneself differently. I asked the Prime Minister for a chance to clarify the matter with him in the coming days."
