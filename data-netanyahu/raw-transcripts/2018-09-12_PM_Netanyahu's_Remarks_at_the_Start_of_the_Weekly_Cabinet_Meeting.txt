PM Netanyahu, at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting, made the following remarks:

"The US made the correct decision when it decided to close the PLO offices in Washington. The Palestinians refuse to enter negotiations with Israel even as they attack Israel with false claims in international forums. Israel very much appreciates the Trump administration decision and supports American actions that are designed to make it clear to the Palestinians that the refusal to enter into negotiations with Israel and the unbridled attacks against Israel will not only not advance peace but will certainly not make things better for the Palestinians.

Yesterday we marked 17 years since the awful terrorist attack against the American people at the Twin Towers in New York and at the Pentagon in [Greater] Washington. This operation was carried out by Al-Qaida, Al-Qaida has passed the torch to Daesh, even as Iran also promotes international terrorism.

The world is being challenged by radical Islam, radical Shiites on the one hand led by Iran, and radical Sunnis led by Daesh, but both have a single goal – to eliminate the free societies, as we recognize, to eliminate Israel and in the end to eliminate the West and others as well.

The time has come for the world to unite in the fight against terrorist organizations. It is doing so to a certain extent against Daesh but it is not doing so against Iran. On the contrary, what we are seeing is that while Iran is sending terrorist cells to Europe, European leaders are appeasing – and reconciling with – Iran, in the same week that the terrorist cells were due to carry out their operations, which we helped thwart. This is unacceptable.

The appeasement of Iran abets the relentless assault on the values and security of the free societies, and the time has come for Western governments to join the strong and clear effort by the Trump administration against the terror regime in Tehran."
