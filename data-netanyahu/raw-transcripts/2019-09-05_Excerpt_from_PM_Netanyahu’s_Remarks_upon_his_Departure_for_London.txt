Following is an excerpt from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s remarks, at Ben-Gurion International Airport, upon departing for London: “This morning we were informed of another violation, more defiance, by Iran, this time in its striving to attain nuclear weapons. This joins Iran’s aggressive acts against international shipping and against countries in the region, as well as its efforts to carry out murderous attacks against the State of Israel, efforts that have not ceased. This is not the time to hold talks with Iran; this is the time to increase the pressure on Iran. I will discuss all of these issue, and others, with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and US Secretary of Defense Mark Esper during my snap visit to London. These are important matters for the State of Israel at all times, but especially now.”
