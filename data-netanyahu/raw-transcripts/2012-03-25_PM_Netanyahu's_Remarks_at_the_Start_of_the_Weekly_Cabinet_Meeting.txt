Following are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s remarks at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting today:

"Last weekend there were three murders in the Arab sector. Reducing crime in the Arab sector is a goal of the Government and it needs to be a goal of the country. I appreciate the fact that there are increasing voices from within the Arab sector, from its leaders, mayors and citizens, calling for stepped-up law enforcement within Arab communities and villages. I think that this is an important change. I add to this my call for enlistment in the civilian service, within which it will also be possible to combine actions for increased law enforcement. The community can help itself. The Arab sector can help itself vis-à-vis increased law enforcement by volunteering in the civilian service as well.

Last week I attended a conference that the Government organized on increasing the involvement of Israeli Arabs in Israel's economic growth. We spoke there about the steps to involve them in the economy, education, transportation, access to jobs and many other issues. I think that all of these things are important. While the Government has invested billions of shekels in moving forward on these goals in the Arab sector, I would like to say that without law enforcement, none of these steps will achieve the goal that we are hoping for and striving toward – i.e. the integration of Israeli Arabs in the State of Israel's progress.

Alongside all of these actions that we are doing and alongside this partnership, there must also be partnership in enforcing the law. We will do our part. I expect a practical response by Arab sector community representatives regarding increased law enforcement in their communities."
