Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this morning, met with outstanding ultra-orthodox national service volunteers for 2013. Among the volunteers were Yosef Avraham from Be'er Sheva, who works with at-risk youth, Ian Yifrach from Ofakim, who served with Yad Sarah, Yisrael Lugassi from Ashkelon, who served with MDA as an ambulance driver and paramedic, Haim Yaakov from Ashdod, who worked with the elderly, and Shmuel Dov Rost from Ashdod, who served in the Chaim Sheba Medical Center Oncology Dept.

Prime Minister Netanyahu told the volunteers, "One of our goals is to lower the barriers between the various parts of the Jewish People and I see you as pioneers in this regard. You are helping not only to integrate the ultra-orthodox public in work that is very significant to the society and security of the State of Israel but you are also lowering barriers and getting rid of stigmas. I believe that we are all responsible for each other and this is what you are doing. Mutual responsibility, deeds of kindness â€“ these are the basic values at the root of our nation and our faith. I would like to thank you for it. Everyone does this in his field and I am pleased to see you volunteering for the main tasks that face us today."
