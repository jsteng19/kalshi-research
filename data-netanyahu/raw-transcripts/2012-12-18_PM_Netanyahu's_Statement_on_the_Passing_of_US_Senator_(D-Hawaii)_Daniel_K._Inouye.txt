Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued the following statement on the passing of US Senator (D-Hawaii) Daniel K. Inouye:

"On behalf of the people of Israel, I wish to express my deepest condolences on the passing of Senator Daniel Inouye. I was proud to call Senator Inouye a friend. He was a humble man with a towering spirit, whose exemplary bravery on the battlefield during World War II was followed by an exemplary life dedicated to serving his country and defending its most cherished values. Since the establishment of the State of Israel, our country has been blessed to have had the unwavering support of outstanding American leaders who were dedicated to strengthening the security of Israel and to deepening the unique and powerful alliance between Israel and the United States. But even among these leaders, the contributions of Senator Inouye stand out. His friendship to the Jewish people knew no bounds, and he worked tirelessly throughout his public life to safeguard the one and only Jewish state. The people of Israel will forever owe him a profound debt of gratitude. My thoughts and prayers are with Senator Inouyeâ€™s family at this difficult time."
