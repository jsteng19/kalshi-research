Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the start of his meeting with Slovak President Andre Kiska, made the following remarks:

Regarding a new community for the Amona evacuees:

"I promised at the outset that we would build a new community. I believe that I first gave that promise back in December and we will uphold it today. In a few hours you will know all the details."

In response to a question as to whether the crisis with [Finance Minister Moshe] Kahlon has been resolved:

"I believe so."

In response to a question about the Foreign Ministry funds:

"I am not prepared to pay for and finance the attacks against us at the UN. We are changing the rules. There are venomous attacks against us there and, therefore, I have already directed that $ 6-7 million be cut from our UN dues. After the vote in the UN Human Rights Council, I decided to cut another $2 million. This considerable sum, almost NIS 40 million, will be transferred to the Foreign Ministry, which is doing exceptional work. They will use it to develop our relations with countries that want to be close to Israel and are cultivating friendship with it."
