Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today, appointed senior Mossad official David Meidan as his special envoy regarding the return of abducted IDF soldier Gilad Shalit. Meidan will replace Haggai Hadas, who will soon complete his duties after approximately two years.

Meidan has served as a senior Mossad official for many years and has been involved in range of activities, some related to Gilad Shalit. Prime Minister Netanyahu recently considered several candidates for the post and chose Meidan based on his expertise, experience and familiarity with all the relevant parties. Meidan, who will remain in the Mossad, will – on instructions from the Prime Minister – carry out an orderly transition with Hadas before taking up his new post on a full-time basis. The Prime Minister further instructed Meidan to use all means at his disposal in order to return Gilad Shalit to his parents.

Prime Minister and Mrs. Netanyahu met earlier this evening with the parents of Gilad Shalit. The Prime Minister told them that the State of Israel was making efforts, most out of public view, in order to bring Gilad home and noted that these efforts would continue in the future as well. "It was important to me that there be no vacuum in dealing with this issue," the Prime Minister said. He added that, "I promise you that in the days and weeks ahead we will continue to use all means at our disposal to bring about Gilad's release."
