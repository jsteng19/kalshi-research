Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, paid a condolence call on the family of the late Hallel Yaffa Ariel, at the family home, along with Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman and Minister Uri Ariel. The Prime Minister spoke with the parents and other family members and said: "We strengthen this place. Apart from the fighting, we will make it stronger. I will sit with the Defense Minister and we will decide how to strengthen the community."

At the conclusion of the visit, Prime Minister Netanyahu said:

"To see Hallel's room, to see the blood stains next to her bed and the books and clothes of a small child, this is shocking. It reminds us again who we are facing. They want to uproot what has been planted and we will deepen the roots. They will not make us leave here. I was impressed by this splendid family. Their spirit will not break and neither will ours. We will deepen the roots."

Minister Ariel said:

"I thank the Prime Minister for coming here to console the mourners, the Ariel gamily in Kiryat Arba. The parents are determined to continue to build and be built here in the area along with the Prime Minister who will decide what needs to be done vis-Ã -vis security and regarding the community. We are continuing on the Jewish People's long journey. Together we will win."
