Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Education Minister Gideon Saar, visited the Education Ministry situation room and observed the Ministry's preparations ahead of the 2012-2013 school year, which opens tomorrow.

During the visit, Prime Minister Netanyahu spoke with siblings Yonatan, Rachel and David Gvili from Or Akiva who are starting first grade tomorrow and wished them good luck and a productive year.

Earlier, Prime Minister Netanyahu spoke with Moshe Holtzberg, whose parents were murdered in the November 2008 terrorist attack on the Chabad House in Mumbai. Moshe, who is now living in Israel with his grandparents, Shimon and Yehudit, will be starting first grade tomorrow. The Prime Minister wished him well and said that the prayers of the entire Jewish people are with him.

During the visit, Prime Minister Netanyahu said, "There is much good news for parents regarding the school year that starts tomorrow: It is starting without strikes. It is offsetting several days of the summer vacation. There is much good news regarding payments: Free education from age 3 â€“ a savings of NIS 800 for every child, subsidized school trips and a significant reduction in text book fees. Our Government is investing great sums in education, for a better future. I would like to wish pupils, parents, teachers and all education staff a successful and productive year."
