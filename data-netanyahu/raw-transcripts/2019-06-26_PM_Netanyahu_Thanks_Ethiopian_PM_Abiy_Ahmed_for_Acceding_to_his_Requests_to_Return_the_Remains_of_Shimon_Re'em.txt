Prime Minister Netanyahu made the following remarks at the start of his meeting with Chilean President Sebastian Piñera: "I would like to thank my friend, Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who has acceded to my requests as well as those of the family of the late Shimon Re'em. He acceded to these requests and we will now bring back his remains. We will continue to work until we also bring the remains of the late Avraham Matzliah. I want to thank the Prime Minister; these are not simple times in Ethiopia. I wish him – and the friendship between us and Ethiopia – much success."
