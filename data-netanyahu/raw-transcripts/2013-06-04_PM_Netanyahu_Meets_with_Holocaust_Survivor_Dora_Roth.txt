Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this afternoon, in his Jerusalem office, met with Holocaust survivor Dora Roth. The Prime Minister invited her to a meeting following her Knesset appearance in late April.

Prime Minister Netanyahu and Dora Roth discussed various ways to improve the welfare of Holocaust survivors. The Prime Minister said that he agreed with her that there are distortions that must be corrected and added that the State of Israel is committed to the welfare of Holocaust survivors. He said that he would ask Prime Minister's Office Director General Harel Locker to advance the issue.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said at the start of the meeting, "I am very impressed by your remarks, by your fervor and your truth. This is what must be seen here â€“ the truth, and this is what we will do. You deeply touched the nation. People understand that we must care for this generation; there isn't much time and this is the main thing."
