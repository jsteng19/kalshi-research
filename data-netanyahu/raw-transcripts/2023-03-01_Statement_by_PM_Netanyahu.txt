Prime Minister Netanyahu, this afternoon: "We will not allow violence against police officers, the blocking of highways and the gross violation of the laws of the state. The right to demonstrate is not a right to anarchy. I give my full backing to National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, the Israel Police Inspector-General and the officers of the Israel Police, who are acting against lawbreakers who are disrupting Israeli citizens' daily lives."
