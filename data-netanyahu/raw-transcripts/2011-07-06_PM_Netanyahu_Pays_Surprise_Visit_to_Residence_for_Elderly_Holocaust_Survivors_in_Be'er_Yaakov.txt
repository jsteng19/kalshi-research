Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Deputy Health Minister Yaakov Litzman and Minister Yossi Peled this morning paid a surprise visit to a residence for elderly Holocaust survivors in Be'er Yaakov, in order to observe the quality of care for its residents, including their living conditions.

Prime Minister Netanyahu met with survivors and heard their views, and asked residents to report any problems to the responsible authorities and even to his office. The Prime Minister and his colleagues toured the facility, checked its level of cleanliness, as well as the food in the kitchen, and spoke with members of the staff.

At the end of the visit, Prime Minister Netanyahu said that in the wake of disturbing reports about the care in residences for elderly Holocaust survivors, he decided to check conditions firsthand. "I am pleased to see that the elderly residents here are satisfied with the conditions. There is fresh food, the kitchen is clean and they are well-cared for. It is important that the elderly know we care about how they are being looked after. It is important that they know that the state, which is responsible for these residences, will verify proper quality-of-care firsthand. We will make other visits. We demand nothing less than excellent care."
