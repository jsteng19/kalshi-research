Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's, in his Speech Today at the Hi-Tech Convention in Jerusalem, Commented about Threats to Breach Israel's Borders on Sunday.

[Translation]

Two and-a-half weeks ago, on May 15, we marked the day of the establishment of the State of Israel. We witnessed attempts by our enemies to undermine our sovereignty and breach the borders of Israel. Iran, Syria, Hezbollah and Hamas were all partners to these provocations. Those same factors are expected in the next few days, once again, to challenge Israel's sovereignty and undermine the borders of the country. Like every country in the world, Israel has the right and the duty to guard its borders and protect them. That is why my instructions are clear: to respond with restraint, yet with the necessary resolve to protect our borders, our communities and our citizens.
