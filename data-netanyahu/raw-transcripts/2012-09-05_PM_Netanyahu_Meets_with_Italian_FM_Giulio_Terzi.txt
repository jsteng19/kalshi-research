Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this afternoon, in his Jerusalem office, met with Italian Foreign Minister Giulio Terzi.

At the start of the meeting, the Prime Minister said: "We are facing great challenges; perhaps the greatest challenge that the international community is facing is Iran’s quest for nuclear weapons. I think that the international community must set a clear red line for Iran that it knows that it cannot go beyond in its pursuit of nuclear weapons, and I think that as hard as it is, the economic sanctions have to be intensified. We appreciate the efforts that you have made and that others in Europe are making. There is one other effort that I think Europe could make to advance the cause of security and peace, and that is to declare Iran’s proxy, Hezbollah, a terrorist organization. It is exactly that. It’s the world’s leading terror organization, and Europe could contribute much by declaring it for what it is."
