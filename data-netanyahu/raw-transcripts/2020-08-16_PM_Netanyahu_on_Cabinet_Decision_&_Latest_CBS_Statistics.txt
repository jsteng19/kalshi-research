“In the Cabinet, we have just approved an additional NIS 8.5 billion in incentives for our economy and to create jobs. I know that there is still great economic distress – we are working around the clock to make things easier for you, citizens of Israel. We just received very good economic news. The Central Bureau of Statistics published that the decline in our GDP in the second quarter of 2020 was 7.8%, which is half the decline in the European states; it is almost the lowest in the world. South Korea is ahead of us and maybe two or three other countries. This is the result of the responsible policy that we have undertaken, which not only reduced the number of deaths in Israel but also the magnitude of the blow to the Israeli economy. We will continue to work for your livelihoods, for our economic future and for your health.”
