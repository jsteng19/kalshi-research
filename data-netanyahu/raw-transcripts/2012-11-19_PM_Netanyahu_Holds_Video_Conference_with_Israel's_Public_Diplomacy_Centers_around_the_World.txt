Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held a video conference with volunteers who are working to assist in the national public diplomacy effort.

Participating in the video conference were personnel from the Prime Minister's Office National Information Directorate, the Public Diplomacy and Diaspora Affairs Ministry, the Foreign Ministry (from Dublin), the IDF Spokesperson's Office New Media Division, and students and public diplomacy activists.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said, "It is good to see you. I want to thank you. You are doing very important work; I follow your activities. We are [operating] on four fronts: The military front, the home front, the diplomatic front and the public diplomacy front. What you are doing greatly strengthens us on the public diplomacy front. We must fight for the truth, for the facts, and your help is worth more than gold. The fact that you are focusing on refuting the industry of lies and that you are reaching so many sectors is a significant addition for the State of Israel. I want to thank you. Continue your important work and I tell you that we will yet face great efforts and responsibilities in the coming days; therefore, thank you very much. I wish you all success. Thank you."
