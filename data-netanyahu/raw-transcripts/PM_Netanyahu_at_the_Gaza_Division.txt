Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the Gaza Division: "I came here to approve the IDF plans for taking control of Gaza City and defeating Hamas. In parallel, I instructed to begin immediate negotiations for the release of all our hostages and the end of the war, on conditions that are acceptable for Israel".

"We're at the decisive stage. I came today to the Gaza Division in order to approve the plans that the IDF presented to me and to the Defense Minister for taking control of Gaza City and defeating Hamas.

I greatly appreciate the mobilization of the reserve soldiers, and of course the regular army, for this essential cause.

In parallel, I have instructed to begin immediate negotiations for the release of all our hostages and the end of the war, on conditions that are acceptable for Israel.

Those two things, the defeat of Hamas and the release of all our hostages, go hand in hand".
