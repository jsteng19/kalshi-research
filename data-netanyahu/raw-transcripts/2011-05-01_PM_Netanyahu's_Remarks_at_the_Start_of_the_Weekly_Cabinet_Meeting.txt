Following are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks at the start of the Cabinet meeting today:

Holocaust Martyrs and Heroes Remembrance Day

will begin this evening. Today, the Cabinet will approve a decision, the goal of which is to recognize a representative organization of Holocaust survivors in Israel. We are committed to action on behalf of Holocaust survivors; we have done much and we will do more. The important question that must be asked today is: Have we learned the lessons of the Holocaust in the world? And to our great regret, the answer is no. A

renewed anti-Semitism is spreading

. Various forces are joining together and flooding the world with anti-Semitism. The hatred of Jews and the denial of their existence have turned into hatred of the Jewish State and denial of its existence.

The agreement that was initialed recently between Hamas, which calls for the destruction of the State of Israel, and the Fatah movement

, must concern not only every Israeli, but all those in the world who aspire to see peace between us and our Palestinian neighbors. Peace is possible only with those who want to live in peace alongside us and not with

those who want to destroy us

. Israel extends its hand in peace to all peoples of the region, to all of our neighbors that aspire to live alongside us in peace, and will stand steadfast against whoever tries to attack us and endanger our existence. I will deliver this clear message to world capitals, and especially to European leaders, during my visits to London and Paris this week."
