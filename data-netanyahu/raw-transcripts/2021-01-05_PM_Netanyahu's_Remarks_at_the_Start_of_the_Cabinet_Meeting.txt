Following are Prime Minister Netanyahu’s remarks at the start of the Cabinet meeting:

"I am continuing to work around the clock to bring millions of vaccines to Israel and, at the same time, the health system is continuing to vaccinate the citizens of Israel at a pace that is arousing the wonder of the entire world.

This combination of bringing millions of vaccines to the country and vaccinating many thousands of citizens every day is enabling us to continue being first in the world in emerging from the coronavirus, opening our economy and getting back to living.

We are first in the world in vaccinations. We must also be first in the world in saving lives.

We see the coronavirus running amok around the world. The British mutation is out of control. Britain is now under full lockdown after a massive mortality rate. Unfortunately, the new coronavirus mutation is also leaping forward with us, but not at the same pace.

The hospitals are warning us that we are entering the most dangerous wave since the outbreak of the pandemic. The Health Ministry and the experts are warning us that we are in an emergency situation and that if we do not act immediately we will lose many hundreds of Israelis – and even more – who will die.

We must not allow this to happen, certainly not at the finish line. I am certain that all members of the Cabinet will show responsibility. At this moment, this is what the public expects of us and this is what the country needs.

I call on all citizens of Israel: Let us make a final effort – together. We will make a tightened and immediate lockdown together with the continuation of the huge vaccines operation.

This is how we will save lives. This is how we will be first in the world to emerge from the coronavirus. This is how we will open our economy and this is how we will get back to living."
