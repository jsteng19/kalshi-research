Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, met with Sri Lankan External Affairs Minister Prof. G.L. Peiris and told him: "Welcome to Israel; it’s an opportunity to strengthen the relationship between Sri Lanka and Israel. I hope to discuss this with you today, along with other problems. We face great challenges of security and peace, with peace being peace with the Palestinians. We have another problem. We have the problem of Iran that is continuing to defy the international community, doesn’t seem to seek an end to its military nuclear program. Like North Korea, it continues to defy all the international standards and I believe that this requires the international community to ratchet up its sanctions and make clear that if this continues there will be also a credible military sanction. I think no other means will make Iran obey the wishes of the international community."
