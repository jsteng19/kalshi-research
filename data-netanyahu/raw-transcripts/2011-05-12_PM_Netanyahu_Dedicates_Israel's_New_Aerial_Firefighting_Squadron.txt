Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today in a ceremony at the Sde Dov Air Force Base, dedicated the State of Israel's

first aerial firefighting squadron

. Public Security Minister Yitzhak Aharonovitch, GOC Air Force Maj.-Gen. Ido Nehushtan, Fire and Rescue Service Commissioner Shahar Ayalon, Elbit Systems President and CEO Joseph Ackerman and Tzvia Riven, the mother of the late Elad Riven, also attended the ceremony. Ms. Riven had been invited by the Prime Minister's wife Sara, who first raised the idea of naming the squadron after Elad during a visit to the Riven family home.

At Prime Minister Netanyahu's behest, the aerial firefighting squadron was assigned to the Air Force in order to carry out his promise that the new squadron would be operational by this coming summer.

The squadron that was dedicated today is composed of seven

Air Tractor 802F aircraft

, each of which is capable of scooping approximately 3,000 liters of water and flying for three hours without refueling. The squadron will be deployed at two bases in the north and south of the country.

In the first stage, the aircraft – which were purchased by Elbit Systems for $20 million – will be flown by pilots from

Chimnir

. The squadron will operate under the responsibility of the Air Force and in coordination with the Fire and Rescue Service.

During the dedication ceremony, Prime Minister and Mrs. Netanyahu gave Tzvia Riven a photograph of the squadron, which was named after her son.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said that Elad had two great loves – he dreamed of the skies and went to the fire, and added that the establishment of the squadron combined both of his loves. The Prime Minister told Tzvia Riven that, "I see you and I understand where Elad received his inner strength. I understand from where he received the daring to charge into the flames in order to try and save the Prison Service cadets."
