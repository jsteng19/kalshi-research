Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today:

“I cannot detail everything we are doing, but I can tell you one thing – we are determined to return our residents in the north home safely.

We are inflicting blows on Hezbollah that it never imagined. We are doing it with might; we are doing it with stratagems. I promise you one thing – we will not rest until they return home.”
