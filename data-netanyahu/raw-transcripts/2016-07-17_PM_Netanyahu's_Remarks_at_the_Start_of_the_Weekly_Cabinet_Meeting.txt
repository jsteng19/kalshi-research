Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting, made the following remarks:

"Israel and Turkey recently agreed on a reconciliation process between them. We assume that this process will continue without any connection to the dramatic events in Turkey over the weekend.

In recent days, we also experienced the shocking terrorist attack in Nice and it underscores the need for a unified and aggressive approach in the face of the murderous terrorism that is attacking the entire world. I sent condolences -- on behalf of the government and people of Israel – and my wishes for a recovery to the wounded, via French President Francois Hollande.

The Palestinian Authority also sent condemnations and condolences, but with one difference: Here, not only do they not condemn vehicular terrorism, they encourage it. They glorify the terrorists responsible and finance them and their families if the terrorists are dead.

Terrorism is terrorism, whether it is in France or Israel, and there must be a unified approach of condemnation and war on this terrorism – here and everywhere else.

Today, the Cabinet will discuss a draft biannual budget law. This law will strengthen economic stability and improve the functioning of government ministries. They will also be able to receive planning and operational outlines for two years in a row. Economic stability, control of expenditures, lowering taxes, reforms with competition – these are what the Finance Minister and I are working on along with the Cabinet ministers, for the benefit of the Israeli economy and the citizens of Israel."
