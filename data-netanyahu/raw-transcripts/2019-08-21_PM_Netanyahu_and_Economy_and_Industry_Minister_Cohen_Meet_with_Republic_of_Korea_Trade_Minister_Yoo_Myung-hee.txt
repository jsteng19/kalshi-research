Prime Benjamin Netanyahu and Economy and Industry Minister Eli Cohen, today at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem, met with Republic of Korea Trade Minister Yoo Myung-hee. Prime Minister Netanyahu at the start of the meeting: We've had free trade agreements with other parts of the world with the United States, with Europe and elsewhere but this is the first free trade agreement we have with an Asian economy, and what an economy, a global leader, a vibrant, advanced economy. Israel is a vibrant, advanced economy and I think our partnership will do tremendous good for both our economies. I'm sure it will multiply our trade which already stands at $2.5 billion. It will grow a lot. I think that this will also offer for Israeli consumers decreased prices, removal of customs, for example from Korean cars. Technological exchanges will give us great advantage for the future. The people of Israel are delighted with this increased cooperation between our two countries. Welcome." Republic of Korea Trade Minister Yoo Myung-hee: "As you mentioned this is a very significant and historic agreement. Both countries, South Korea and Israel, we have a lot of similarities and also we have complimentary economic structure. Based on this FTA I'm sure that it will further promote our trade and investment as well as further promote our technology cooperation."
