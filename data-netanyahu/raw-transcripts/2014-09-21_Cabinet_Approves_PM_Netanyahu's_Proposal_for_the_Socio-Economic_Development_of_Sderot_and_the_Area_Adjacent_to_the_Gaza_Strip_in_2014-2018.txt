The Cabinet, at its weekly meeting today (Sunday, 21 September 2014), approved Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's proposal for the communal settlement and socio-economic development of Sderot and the area adjacent to the Gaza Strip in 2014-2018. The NIS 1.3 billion five-year plan, which was formulated by a team of ministry director generals led by Prime Minister's Office Director General Harel Locker, is the largest and most comprehensive economic development plan ever made for the area and joins the Government's 13 July decision to allocate NIS 417 to the area adjacent to the Gaza Strip in 2015-2016.

Prime Minister Netanyahu, at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting, said, "Today, the Cabinet will approve a NIS 1.3 billion supplement for Sderot and the communities in the area adjacent to the Gaza Strip. This is the largest investment that the State of Israel has ever made in this area. This is in addition to the NIS 417 million that we transferred during Operation Protective Edge. We are developing a new industrial zone in Sderot, transportation infrastructure in the area and are encouraging young people and students to move to the area adjacent to the Gaza Strip. We came to this country to build and to be built. We came to this part of our land in order to build and be built in it and nobody will uproot us. We will strengthen our hold and our development of this area just as in other areas."

Prime Minister Netanyahu also said, "On Tuesday we will submit for Cabinet approval a supplement regarding an approximately NIS 2 billion in additional funds for the communities and cities of the south In the framework of this decision, we will build a new hospital in Be'er Sheva, in addition to the hundreds of additional beds for the existing Soroka Medical Center. We will connect new natural gas infrastructures for the benefit of factories in the south. We will invest in initiatives to connect the Negev in the framework of the Digital Israel program. We will encourage small and mid-size businesses. We will develop tourism and all aspects of life including the important cyber aspect for all residents of the Negev, including Bedouin. This is a deep commitment on our part. I think that it has found expression."

Today's decision focuses on:

* Economy – A significant expansion of incentives and assistance to businesses in the area;

* Agriculture – Development of the agricultural sector, the main anchor of activity for communities in the area adjacent to the Gaza Strip;

* Communal development – Activity to support continuation of the increase in the number of residents of the area; and

* Quality of life – Significant investment in renovating and upgrading infrastructures in order to boost the quality of life and the standard of living.

In the context of the various steps, preference will be given to frontline communities close to the border fence, as well as to actions to increase the socio-economic strength of Sderot.

The additional plan to develop the area adjacent to the Gaza Strip and strengthen communities close to the fence is designed to provide a growth engine for the economy, industry, agriculture, construction and social welfare. The Government intends to thereby approve additional investment and Government assistance to the area in order to encourage economic growth and boost communal settlement in the area. Since 2009, there has been a continual increase in the number of residents in the area adjacent to the Gaza Strip. The Government's current steps are designed to assure the continuation of this demographic trend.
