Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today took his leave of outgoing Civil Service Commissioner Samuel Hollander, who is stepping down after 14 years in office, and after 40 years of public service. Vice Premier Sylvan Shalom, Foreign Minister Avider Lieberman, Education Minister Gideon Saar, Finance Minister Yuval Steinitz, Social Welfare and Social Services Minister Yitzhak Herzog, Minister Benny Begin, Deputy Finance Minister Yitzhak Cohen, Netanya Mayor Miriam Feirberg-Ikar and others also attended the farewell ceremony, which was held in the Prime Minister's Bureau.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said: "Fourteen years ago, I appointed you Civil Service Commissioner. Before that, the late Yitzhak Rabin appointed you Cabinet Secretary. You have successfully filled post after post and gained the trust of your superiors. You were a loyal partner to my actions, twice as Prime Minister and once as Finance Minister. I wish you continued success in all your endeavors."

Shmuel Hollander noted that he has fulfilled all of his posts out of a sense of mission and thanked all those with whom he has worked, with Prime Minister Netanyahu first and foremost.
