Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this morning, at IDF Northern Command headquarters, held a security assessment and briefing with IDF Chief-of-Staff Lt.-Gen. Aviv Kochavi, GOC Northern Command Maj.-Gen. Amir Baram, GOC Intelligence Maj.-Gen. Tamir Hayman, GOCOperations Maj.-Gen. Aharon Haliva and other senior officials. Prime Minister Netanyahu: “Yesterday’s action was important; it thwarted an infiltration into our territory. Everything happening now is the result of the effort by Iran and its Lebanese proxies to entrench militarily in our region. Nasrallah is serving this Iranian interest at Lebanon’s expense. I do not suggest that anybody try the IDF or the State of Israel. We are determined to defend ourselves.” Prime Minister Netanyahu added after the assessment: “I am impressed that the IDF is well prepared for every possible scenario. We will continue to take action to thwart Iran’s military entrenchment in our region. We will do whatever is necessary to defend ourselves and I suggest that Hezbollah consider this simple fact. Israel is ready for any scenario.”
