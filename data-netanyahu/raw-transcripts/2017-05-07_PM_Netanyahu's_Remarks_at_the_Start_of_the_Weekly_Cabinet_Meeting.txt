Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this morning at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting, made the following remarks:

"In two weeks, the State of Israel will host US President Donald Trump, and his wife, on his first trip as President outside the United States. The President will be warmly welcomed here as a great friend of Israel and as is customary for the leader of our greatest ally, the United States.

The President is seeking to examine ways of renewing the peace process with the Palestinians. I share in this desire as do the citizens of Israel. We want peace. We are also educating our children for peace. I heard Abu Mazen, who praises terrorists and pays them according to the severity of the murders they committed against Israelis; I heard Abu Mazen say that the Palestinians are also educating their children for peace. I regret that this is simply incorrect.

Former minister Benny Elon – may his memory be blessed – passed away over the weekend. On behalf of the Government of Israel, I would like to send condolences to Emunah, their children and their entire Elon family. Benny loved the Land of Israel, the State of Israel and the heritage of Israel, and worked greatly on their behalf. Benny also worked to deepen links with Christians from around the world who love Israel and did much in this area.

I would like to send my condolences and those of the entire Cabinet to our friend Minister Aryeh Deri on the passing of his dear mother Esther, may her memory be blessed. We share in his grief and that of the entire Deri family."
