Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today expressed satisfaction over the recent economic data published by the Central Bureau of Statistics, which shows that the Israeli economy has returned to growth in the second quarter of 2009.

"The aggregate data from the most recent quarters indicate that the situation of the Israeli economy is better than those of the world's leading economies," Prime Minister Netanyahu said. "Increases in private consumption, exports and tax collection are very encouraging."

The Prime Minister emphasized that he – together with Finance Minister Yuval Steinitz – will continue to lead a consistent economic policy that encourages both growth and stability in the Israeli economy. "First and foremost," the Prime Minister added, "we will act together with the ministers in removing bureaucratic obstacles – in the reform of the Israel Lands Administration, to simplify planning and building processes and in extending a network of railways and roads. All of this will lower the prices of apartments throughout the country and will bring the periphery closer to the center."
