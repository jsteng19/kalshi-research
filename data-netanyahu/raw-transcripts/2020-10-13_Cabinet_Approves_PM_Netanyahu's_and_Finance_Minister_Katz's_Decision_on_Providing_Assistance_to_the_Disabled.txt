The Cabinet, today, approved Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's and Finance Minister Yisrael Katz's decision on providing assistance to the disabled. The law will be sent to the Knesset for approval; the grants are expected to reach disabled persons' bank accounts this month. Under the law, which serves as an alternative to the second phase of support payments to the disabled, a one-time grant will be determined for the disabled in the continuing state budget, which has been approved by the Cabinet and the Knesset. The amount of the grant will be determined according to the type of support payment, the percentage of disability and the number of months of eligibility for the disabled person in 2020, as has also been coordinated the disabled persons' organizations. The grant for all disabled persons will be paid in two phases â€“ in October and December 2020. The cost of the move is NIS 940 million. The amount for the grant will be determined according to the type of support payment, the percentage of disability and the number of months of eligibility for the disabled person in 2020. For example, those eligible for general disability grants for all of 2020 and who have a 100% disability will receive grants of up to NIS 2,280.
