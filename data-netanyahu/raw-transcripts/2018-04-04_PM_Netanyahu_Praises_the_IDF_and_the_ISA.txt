Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, made the following remarks:

"I praise the IDF and the ISA for thwarting the terrorist attack at sea planned by the Islamic Jihad terrorist organization. The security forces will operate on every front to protect the State of Israel and its citizens.

This is proof of the true intentions of the terrorist organizations in Gaza which are trying to camouflage their murderous intentions by organizing provocations on the security fence, the entire goal of which is to provide cover for terrorists to carry out acts of terrorism against the State of Israel."
