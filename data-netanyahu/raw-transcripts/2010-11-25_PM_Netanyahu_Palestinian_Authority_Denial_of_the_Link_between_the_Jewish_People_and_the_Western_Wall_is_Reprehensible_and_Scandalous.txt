Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening made the following remarks:

"The Palestinian Authority Information Ministry's denial of the link between the Jewish People and the Western Wall is reprehensible and scandalous.

The Western Wall has been the Jewish People's most sacred place for almost 2,000 years, since the destruction of the Second Temple.

This is not the only instance in which Palestinians are trying to distort historical facts in order to deny the deep and historic link between the Jewish People and its homeland.

When the Palestinian Authority denies the link between the Jewish People and the Western Wall, it calls into serious question its intentions of reaching a peace agreement, the foundations of which are coexistence and mutual recognition.

The Government of Israel expects Palestinian Authority leaders to disavow and condemn the aforesaid document, refrain from distorting historical facts and encourage the creation of a bridge to peace that will lead to an historic reconciliation between the two peoples."
