Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening: "I send my condolences to the family of the two people who were murdered, a father and son, whose lives were cut short in such a brual and abhorrent manner, over Shabbat. The security forces are redoubling their efforts to apprehend the murderer and settle accounts with him, just as we have done with all murderers until now."
