In the context of a Cabinet discussion, today, on the proposal by Jerusalem and Heritage Minister Meir Porush regarding the preparations for Israelis' travel to Uman in Ukraine ahead of Rosh Hashanah, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu explained that in his conversation with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the latter had made it clear that there are not enough shelters in Uman for local residents, let alone foreign tourists. Prime Minister Netanyahu would like to underscore the following for those traveling to Uman [translated from Hebrew]: "Israeli citizens who are traveling to Ukraine need to act responsibly regarding their trips at this time. The Holy One has not always protected us, both on Ukrainian and other European soil. It must be understood that in the State of Israel, when missiles fall on us, citizens enter shelters and there is protection. There, there are no shelters and no protection." Prime Minister Netanyahu directed the Minister for Foreign Affairs to underscore the MFA travel warning regarding Ukraine and detail the threat involved in traveling there.
