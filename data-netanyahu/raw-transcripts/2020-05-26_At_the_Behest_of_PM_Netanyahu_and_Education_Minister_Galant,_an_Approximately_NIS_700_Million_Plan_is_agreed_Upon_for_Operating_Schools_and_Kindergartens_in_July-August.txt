At the behest of Prime Minister Netanyahu and Education Minister Yoav Galant, and in conjunction with the Finance Ministry and the Federation of Local Authorities (FLA), Prime Minister's Office Director General Ronen Peretz, Education Ministry Director General Shmuel Abuav, Finance Ministry Budget Director Shaul Meridor and FLA Chairman Haim Bibas, today (Tuesday, 26 May 2020), agreed on an approximately NIS 700 million plan to operate schools and kindergartens in July and August. The school year in kindergartens and elementary schools will be extended until 13 July 2020. Educational summer camps will be operated immediately afterward, until the afternoon hours in kindergartens and 1st and 2nd grades, and on a regular footing for 3rd and 4th grades, until 6 August 2020. The outline for operating the schools and kindergartens during the summer vacation was formulated in order to assist working parents and restore the economy to full activity, and is also designed to facilitate the closing of educational and academic gaps accumulated by pupils during the corona crisis. Extending the school year and postponing the start of the summer vacation will enable parents to continue their regular work and greatly save on household expenses for summer camps, and will assist the economy in recovering from the crisis.
