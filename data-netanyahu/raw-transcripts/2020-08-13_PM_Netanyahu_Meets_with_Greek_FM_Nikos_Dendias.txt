Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, at the Prime Minister’s Office in Jerusalem, met with Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias and said at the start of their meeting: “It is very good to see you. Please convey my regards to Prime Minister Mitsotakis. Your visit here is one more expression of the great friendship between Israel and Greece. It was a long time coming but it is now expanding in every direction. The first direction is common geopolitical interests of two democracies in the eastern Mediterranean. Obviously, we view gravely any aggression by anyone, including Turkey, in the eastern Mediterranean. Secondly, we want to continue expanding our economic ties and of course our tourist ties and business ties. We will discuss this gladly and again I am glad to see that Greece is doing well.”
