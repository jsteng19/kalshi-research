Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara, this evening, at Teddy Stadium in Jerusalem, attended the opening ceremony of the 20th Maccabiah Games. Prime Minister Netanyahu: "Dear Maccabiah participants, Welcome to Israel, welcome to Jerusalem. I have two messages for you today. The first is: Excel in sports; run, kick, jump, jump with the skies. Achieve everything you want and beyond what you want. Now, I have personal experience in this. It's mixed. You see, I was pretty athletic when I was young and I tried out for the wrestling team. I broke my arm at 14. Then recently, I thought I'd take a shot at soccer. I played in a soccer game of young Jews and Arabs in Israel. I broke my leg. So, I cannot tell you, dear athletes, break a leg. I say: succeed, excel, win. You are all winners, you are all champions. The second message is: We're all one people. The Maccabiah is named for the Maccabees. 2,200 years ago we were conquered by the descendants of Alexander the great, and the Maccabees, five brothers, liberated our land against all odds. They liberated Jerusalem. They made us free and independent. Centuries later, when our people were dispersed, homeless, totally incapable of defending ourselves, we suffered the greatest tragedy that any people has known in the history of man. And yet, we came back, rebuilt our land, re-established our state, rebuilt an army. The people of Israel are strong and the State of Israel is strong. We are all descendants of the Maccabees. You are descendants of the Maccabees. And in 80 lands, remember one thing. You are proud citizens of your countries, but remember this is your land too. Welcome to your homeland, welcome to Israel, welcome to Jerusalem, our eternal capital. Good luck to you all."
