The IAEA investigation proves beyond any doubt that Iran's secret program for the development of nuclear weapons continued even after 2003, as Israel has maintained.

In addition, the report exposes the methods Iran used to conceal and deceive regarding its nuclear program.

The most glaring example of this pertains to the Parchin facility where the Iranians tried to hide and tamper with evidence of their illicit activities.

Israel expects the international community to continue and expand the IAEA investigation in these areas and to use all means at its disposal to ensure that Iran will not be able to secretly build a nuclear weapon. Unless and until the investigation is completed, the world will not know the full extent of Iran's covert nuclear weapons program and where it stands today.
