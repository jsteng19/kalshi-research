PM Netanyahu:

Good morning. Itâ€™s very good to see you, Senator Mitchell, again. We are practiced hands, and we extend our hands to the United States and to the Palestinians in the quest for advancing peace, prosperity and security in our region. So, I welcome you to it and I look forward to our discussions.

Senator Mitchell:

Thank you very much, Mr. Prime Minister. I too look forward to our discussions. I appreciate your courtesy in seeing us here, and hope to bring this phase of our discussions to an early conclusion and to move forward in our common search for comprehensive peace in the region. Thank you very much.

PM Netanyahu:

Thank you. I want to add something I said to the Senator a minute ago: I think all the people of Israel were deeply moved by the fact, George, that you came with the Ambassador of the United States yesterday to that moving ceremony, during our moment of tragedy. It is much appreciated sign of the closeness between the United States of America and Israel.

Senator Mitchell:

Thank you.
