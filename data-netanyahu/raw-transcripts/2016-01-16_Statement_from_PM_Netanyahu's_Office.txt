Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office:

"Israel will continue to monitor the implementation of the agreement and will warn about any violation.

Even after the signing of the nuclear agreement, Iran has not relinquished its aspiration to obtain nuclear weapons and it will continue to undermine stability in the Middle East and spread terrorism around the world while violating its international obligations.

The major powers and the IAEA must closely monitor activity at Iran's nuclear installations and other sites in order to verify that it is not continuing to develop nuclear weapons in secret. Unless there is an appropriate response to each violation, Iran will understand that it can continue to develop nuclear weapons, undermine regional stability and spread terrorism.

Israel will continue to monitor the situation and warn about Iran's negative activity, and will do everything necessary to safeguard its security and defend itself."
