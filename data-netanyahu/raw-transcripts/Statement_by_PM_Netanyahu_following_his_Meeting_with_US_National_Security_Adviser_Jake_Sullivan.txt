Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening:

"I met today with US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. I greatly appreciate the US support for Israel in the supply of munitions for the IDF, in blocking the attempts at the UN to stop the fighting and in the assistance in returning our hostages.

I would like to clarify: The return of our hostages is a main goal. We are not relenting in our efforts even for a moment, even at this moment.

I told our American friends: Our heroic soldiers have not fallen in vain. Out of the deep pain of their having fallen, we are more determined than ever to continue fighting until Hamas is eliminated â€“ until absolute victory."
