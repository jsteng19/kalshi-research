Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made the following remarks earlier today at the Knesset:

The IDF is continuing to – strongly and decisively – attack the terrorists in the Gaza Strip

. Whoever intends to harm our citizens – we will strike at him. The winning combination is that of crushing offensive capabilities, i.e. the ability of the IDF and its operations to attack the terrorists wherever they are, important defensive measures and – of course – the resilience of the citizens in the south. This combination of three things – offensive ability, defensive ability and civic resilience – allows us to accurately and painfully strike at terrorism.

Yesterday, I met with 30 southern council heads

. The backing and the understanding that I received are an example for leadership that is tested in moments such as these. The IDF is ready to expand its operations and continue them as necessary."
