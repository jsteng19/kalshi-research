Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today, met with US Representative Darrell Issa (R-CA). Following are PM Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks at the start of the meeting:

"The radical Islamic terrorism now threatens the entire world. It threatens Israel, it threatens the United States, it threatens the moderate Arab regimes, it threatens Europe, everybody. I think that we face the same Islamist terror network and we have to fight it together. Hamas is ISIS, ISIS is Hamas. You saw the gruesome beheading of James Foley, we see the gruesome murder of three teenagers which Hamas just admitted that they did. These are branches of the same poisonous tree. We have to make a common front against the common front of radical Islamic terrorism. The free world and democracies have to stand together against this terrorism. That's the only way we'll roll them back, ultimately that's the only way we'll defeat them. I want to welcome you and I want to thank the strong American support from the President, through the Secretary of State, through both houses of Congress and the Senate, everybody, the American people. It's a great source of support for Israel at this time."
