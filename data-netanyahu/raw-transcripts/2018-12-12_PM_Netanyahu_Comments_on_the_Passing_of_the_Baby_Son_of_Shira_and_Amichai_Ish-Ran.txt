Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening, made the following remarks at the annual GPO civil New Year toast with the foreign media:

"Our hearts are with Shira and Amichai over the passing of their four day old son who did not even have a name. The murderers are abhorrent, the most deviant criminals on earth. The security forces are pursuing them and I hope that there will be news soon on this matter. We will not slacken until we find them and deal with them to the fullest extent of the law."
