Strategic Affairs Minister Moshe Yaalon and Strategic Affairs Ministry Director-General Yossi Kuperwasser, at the weekly Cabinet meeting, presented the "incitement index"* which shows that in recent months there has been an upsurge in the level of incitement in the Palestinian Authority against the State of Israel.

In response, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said:

"I see two important things in this index. First, the index constitutes an important clarification and reminder of where we live. Usually, we wait for crises in order to be reminded of our environment. The index sheds light and helps us prepare ourselves and avoid the mistake of not understanding with whom we are dealing with, who cooperates with and initiates this awful incitement. The Palestinian leadership is bequeathing this incitement to the coming generations and is preventing them from holding a dialogue of peace, the result of which is that it itself is incapable of adopting a dialogue of peace.

The second point is that it is a reminder to the world that the root of the conflict is the refusal of the Palestinians to recognize the national state of the Jewish People's right to exist. We have seen horrific things here, which – inter alia – define Jews as those who poison wells, and which lay the groundwork for harsh and brutal deeds. We must bring this to the attention of the governments of the world, especially ahead of the upcoming UN General Assembly."
