Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, met with a delegation of members of the US House of Representatives Armed Services Committee headed by Chairman Howard P. "Buck" McKeon (R-CA) and said:

"We're faced with common enemies, radical Islamic terrorists who have absolutely no inhibitions on executing people, terrorizing people, targeting innocent civilians. We've just had ISIS conduct mass executions. This is exactly what Hamas has done in Gaza. We've just had a branch of al-Qaeda right on the Golan Heights kidnap dozens of UN peacekeepers. These are common enemies of Israel, the United States and all the civilized countries. And I think we should take a common stand to defeat them. And I appreciate your support, the support of the United States of America, in this common effort."

US Rep. McKeon said: "Thank you for standing up to these enemies of mankind, people that have no value of human life, that want to rule the world however way they can do it. I think the example that you have set, that your people have set when they've been attacked, how you've been able to defend your people with the least possible loss of human life, sets an example for the world. When ISIS goes in, kills people indiscriminately, lines them up, just kills them cold-blooded and you go out of your way to avoid death but still to protect your people I think is a classic example. And on the House Armed Services Committee, we're happy with the work we've been able to do, working with you on Iron Dome and how you've used it to protect human life. And we will keep that bond and that friendship and that special relationship that we have forever."
