Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening:"We are starting the week with gigantic news.

I spoke over the weekend with the heads of the companies that are providing us with the vaccines and I told them that our goal by next weekend is to reach 150,000 vaccines a day. This is fantastic but such a magnitude is a world record. I asked them to match the rate at which the vaccines are supplied to the pace of the inoculations and they said that they think they can do it.

This means that within 30 days of reaching this pace we will have vaccinated 4.5 million citizens. Since everyone needs two injections, after one month we will have vaccinated 2.25 million Israeli citizens. There is nothing like this in the world.This is the critical stage, the first stage, because here is the population at risk, all the medical teams, all of the people over 60. 95% of mortality is in this bracket. As soon as we are done with this stage, within 30 days we can emerge from the coronavirus, open the economy and do things that no country can do.Afterward, another 4.5 million will come and another 4.5 million but this is the critical stage and we can accomplish it. Gigantic news. But please, we are heading to a huge vaccines operation unlike anything in the world and I ask you at the same time to do the short and tightened lockdown. The two things together will get us out of the coronavirus first in the world. Have a good week."
