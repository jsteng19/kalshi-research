Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"I would like to commend the IDF, the ISA and the security services for apprehending the reprehensible murderer of the late Amit Ben-Yigal. I have given the order to demolish the home of this murderer. Whoever tries to attack us â€“ we will find him, sooner or later. In recent years you have seen that it is sooner."
