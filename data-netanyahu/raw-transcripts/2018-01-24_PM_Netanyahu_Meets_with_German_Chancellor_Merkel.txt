PM Netanyahu in Davos met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Following the meeting, the Prime Minister said:

"It was an important meeting. Of course we discussed the nuclear agreement with Iran. I said that in my view the only existing option at the moment is to put in real – not cosmetic – changes that will prevent Iran from going nuclear which would otherwise be assured by the agreement as it stands.

I also expressed my appreciation for Chancellor Merkel's genuine commitment to the security of Israel. She said that she understands our concerns regarding the nuclear agreement even though she does not necessarily agree with the way in which we want to deal with it. To this end the Europeans will hold discussions among themselves, and with the US, but she understands that this touches on our concerns, the things that could threaten our very existence. She has proven this commitment in the past at various opportunities. I am satisfied that our positions have been well-understood."
