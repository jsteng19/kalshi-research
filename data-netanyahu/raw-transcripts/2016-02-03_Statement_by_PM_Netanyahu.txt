Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu:

I reject the recent disparaging and divisive remarks by ministers and members of Knesset about Reform Jews.

Reform and Conservative Jews are part and parcel of the Jewish people and should be treated with respect.

The government approved this week a historic compromise that ensures that the Western Wall will continue to be a source of unity and inspiration for the entire Jewish people.

This is the governmentâ€™s policy. This is my policy.
