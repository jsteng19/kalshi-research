Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"Thank you for all your help and standing up for Israel, standing up for the truth, which is standing up for America. Actually, I think it's standing up for the UN as it was originally conceived. People appreciate truth. We have an ancient Hebrew saying that when somebody tells a truth, you can feel it. So people feel it, they not only understand it, they feel it. And we feel it. We're glad to see the fruits of your efforts, uncommon common sense. And it's the way people react across a very wide spectrum. President Trump and you I think have changed the discourse, have drawn new standards, and everybody's taking up, and that's great. I think it makes a world of difference, both for Israel and the US. Again, I felt that the UN would collapse, you know, that whole scaffolding of lies would just collapse. I think you've put in that simple word, truth."

US Ambassador to the UN Haley:

"You know, that's all I've done, is tell the truth, and it's kind of overwhelming at the reaction. It was a habit. It was a habit. It was something that we're so used to doing. And if there's anything I have no patience for is bullies, and the UN was being such a bully to Israel, because they could. We're starting to see a turn in New York. I think they know they can't keep responding in the way they've been responding. They sense that the tone has changed. We were talking with some Ambassadors in Geneva and, that are all on the Human Rights Council, and we talked to them about Agenda Item Seven, some of them, they were embarrassed by it. You know, they acknowledge the fact that it just makes no sense. You can't sit there, and of all countries, Israel?"
