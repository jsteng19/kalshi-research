Following are excerpts from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting today:

"Today, we begin the process of approving the state budget. We do so against the background of a very serious international economic crisis. I must say that every country feels it. We feel it and we will yet feel it more. Tens of thousands of Israelis have already been fired and they are in pain. Very many others are in fear of being fired and I understand the pain and I understand their apprehension. We are committed to doing our utmost in order to stop the spread of unemployment and in order to meet the State of Israel's other needs: To help the weak, especially the elderly and – of course – to provide for the basic needs of the nation, including security, education and other needs represented here around this table. It will not be easy. It will be very difficult. The needs clash; this will require us to make decisions. In the end, I believe that we will pass a serious and responsible budget that fits the circumstances; we can save the nation from the crisis. We can protect Israeli citizens' jobs and meet other needs. I am committed to this; the Government is committed to this. Together, after many deliberations and discussions around this table, there is no doubt that we will submit a good budget and a good economic plan for the State of Israel that will start to move the economy forward."
