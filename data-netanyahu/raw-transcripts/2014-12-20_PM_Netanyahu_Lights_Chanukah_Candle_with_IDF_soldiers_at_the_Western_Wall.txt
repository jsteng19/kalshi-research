Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening, lit Chanukah candles with IDF soldiers at the Western Wall and told them:

"Maoz tzur yeshuati [literally: My refuge, my rock of salvation]* but our salvation is also our faith. Today [the Shabbat of Chanukah] we read in Zechariah 4:6, 'Not by might, nor by power, but by My spirit' but the might and the power come from the spirit and the spirit is that of the Maccabees, 'He that keeps Israel neither slumbers nor sleeps.'

Soldiers, I would like to commend you for your contribution to the security of Israel. Israel's security takes precedence over everything and I will not ignore the firing of even one rocket; therefore, the air force responded to this firing by destroying a cement factory that served to rebuild the tunnels that we hit in Operation Protective Edge. Hamas bears the responsibility for any escalation. We will safeguard Israel's security."

*This is the first line of this Chanukah song.
