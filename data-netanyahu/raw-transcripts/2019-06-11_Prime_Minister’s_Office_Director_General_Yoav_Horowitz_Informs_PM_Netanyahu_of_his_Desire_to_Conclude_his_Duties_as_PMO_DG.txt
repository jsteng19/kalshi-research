Prime Minister’s Office Director General Yoav Horowitz informed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of his desire to conclude his duties as Director General of the Prime Minister’s Office. The foregoing is in continuation of DG Horowitz’s previous announcement to the Prime Minister before the recent elections in which he asked to conclude his duties upon the formation of the government or by June at the latest. Yoav Horowitz has served as the chief of the Prime Minister’s staff for the past three years; in the past year, he has also served as Director General of the Prime Minister’s Office. Prime Minister Netanyahu thanked Yoav Horowitz for three years of dedicated and professional service in which the latter dealt with the national and central issues on the agenda of the State of Israel including settlement, security, the economy and society. Prime Minister Netanyahu: “Yoav has been at the forefront of the main efforts and has greatly assisted me in important work for the State of Israel. I am certain that he will continue to stand out in the future.” Yoav Horowitz: “I would like to thank the Prime Minister for the opportunity and the confidence that I received from him, and for the privilege to work alongside him and serve the citizens of Israel and State of Israel.” Prime Minister Netanyahu decided that Deputy Cabinet Secretary Ronen Peretz will serve as Acting Director General of the Prime Minister’s Office and will work in tandem with National Economic Council head Prof. Avi Simhon. “I am certain that Ronen, who has been in the office already for two years, knows how to manage the office properly and professionally,” the Prime Minister said.
