Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: "I was sorry to hear of the illness of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who announced his resignation. I would like to express my appreciation for the friendship forged between our two countries, during which Japanese investments in Israel grew tenfold, and cooperation between both countries flourished in many areas. My good friend Shinzo Abe, I wish you good health and success. You will always be welcome here."
