Prime Minister and Defense Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, last night, made the following remarks: "I congratulate the ISA, Israel Police special anti-terror unit and the IDF on the quick action that led to the elimination of the abhorrent terrorist who murdered Sgt. Gal Keidan and Rabbi Achiad Ettinger. The long arm of Israel reaches all those who attack our civilians and our soldiers."
