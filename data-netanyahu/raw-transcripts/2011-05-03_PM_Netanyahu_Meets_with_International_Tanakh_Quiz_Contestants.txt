Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and IDF Chief Education Officer Brig.-Gen. Eli Shremister today met with the contestants in this year's International

Tanakh

Contest, which will be held on

Independence Day

next week, in Jerusalem, under the title "Loving the Land." Fifty-two young people from over 10 countries will participate in this year's quiz.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said this was an opportunity for the young people to deepen their knowledge of the Tanakh and use it as guidebook in order to become more familiar with the country, on foot. He added that he hopes the young people who came here, "will decide that the State of Israel is not only our national home but their personal home as well."
