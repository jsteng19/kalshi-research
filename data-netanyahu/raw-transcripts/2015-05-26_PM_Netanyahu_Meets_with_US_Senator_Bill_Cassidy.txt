Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with US Senator Bill Cassidy (R-LA) and told him at the start of their meeting:

"We welcome the partnership, bipartisan, with the United States because we think that the relationship between Israel and the United States is a precious asset for both countries. Everyone in Israel thinks as I do.

As we are meeting, the P5+1 talks are reconvening, and I’m afraid they’re rushing to what I consider is a very bad deal. I see no reason to rush to a deal and certainly not a bad deal that paves Iran’s path to the bomb, but also fills Iran’s coffers with tens of billions of dollars to pursue its aggression throughout the Middle East and around Israel’s borders. I think it’s important to apply pressure to get a better deal, one that avoids these two pitfalls, and I believe that this is necessary and urgent and possible for both our countries. I will say this: ISIS is in the news. Its murderous actions are horrific. As horrific as ISIS is, once Iran, the preeminent terrorist state of our time, acquires nuclear weapons, it will be a hundred times more dangerous, a thousand times more dangerous and more destructive than ISIS. I think we have to resist both ISIS and Iran. We shouldn’t give Iran a path to nuclear weapons and billions of dollars to pursue aggression because of ISIS. ISIS should be fought; Iran should be stopped."
