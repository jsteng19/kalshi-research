Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this morning expressed his revulsion over last night's acts of violence in Jerusalem and near Ramallah.

"The Jewish values according to which we were raised and according to which we raise our children reject outright such behavior. Freedom of worship for all religions will be upheld in Israel and we will bring to justice these contemptible beings who perpetrated this crime," said Prime Minister Netanyahu.
