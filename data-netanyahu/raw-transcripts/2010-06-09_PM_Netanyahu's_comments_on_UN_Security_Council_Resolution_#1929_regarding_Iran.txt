"The resolution passed today in the Security Council through President Obama`s determined efforts is a positive step. The United States rallied an impressive majority in the Security Council in the face of Iran's defiance.

The resolution makes clear to Iran that the leading powers of the world are opposed to its nuclear weapons program.

The greatest danger to peace is that the world's most dangerous regimes would acquire the world's most dangerous weapons. The international community's highest priority must be to prevent this threat from materializing.

We hope that today's positive step will be followed by strong action on the part of individual countries including those targeting Iran's energy sector."
