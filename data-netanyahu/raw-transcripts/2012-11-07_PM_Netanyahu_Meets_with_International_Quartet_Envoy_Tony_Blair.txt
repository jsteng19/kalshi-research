Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this morning, met with international quartet for the Middle East envoy Tony Blair. Following are their remarks from the start of the meeting:

Prime Minister Netanyahu: "I listened very carefully to President Abbas's recent statements. I have a constant suggestion which I renew today â€“ I said it two days ago, I'm saying it again today. I think the best thing to do is to sit down together, negotiate without preconditions, avoid unilateral actions in the UN and try to get on with peace. That's my suggestion to President Abbas, I hope you can help me with this."

Tony Blair: "First of all, I think the single most important thing now, that President Obama has been re-elected, I think this gives us a great opportunity actually to re-energize this process and to try to make sure that we get back around the table and have a negotiation, and that is the best and only way to try and create peace. So I'm looking forward very much to the opportunity that now presents itself and I look forward to working with you Mr. Prime Minister in order to achieve that."
