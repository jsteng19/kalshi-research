Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with Czech Republic Foreign Minister Lubomir Zaoralek and said:

"One of the things that concerns us is our desire to advance peace. A few days ago, on Israeli television, I heard President Abbas say that if I invite him to meet, he'll come. So as I said this morning to an American Congressional delegation, I'm inviting him again.

I've cleared my schedule this week. Any day he can come, I'll be here. Now, we have a lot of things to discuss, but the first item is ending the Palestinian campaign of incitement to murder Israelis. My door is always open to those who want to pursue peace with Israel."
