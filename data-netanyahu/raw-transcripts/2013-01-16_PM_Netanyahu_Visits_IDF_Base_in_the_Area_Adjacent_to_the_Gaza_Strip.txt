Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Ehud Barak, IDF Deputy Chief-of-Staff Maj.-Gen. Gadi Eizenkot and GOC Southern Command Maj.-Gen. Tal Russo, this afternoon visited an IDF base in the area adjacent to the Gaza Strip and assessed the situation in the wake of Operation Pillar of Defense. According to security establishment data, last month was the quietest in the south since January 2001.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said: "I am very impressed by the advanced technological means and even more so by our young soldiers operating them here. The IDF, the ISA and the security forces are doing very important work here; they are maintaining the quiet that has been kept since Operation Pillar of Defense. However, let us not delude ourselves. This quiet could be violated in an instant, and the IDF and the security forces are ready for any scenario. We will do whatever is necessary to defend the security of Israel's citizens in this area and in others."
