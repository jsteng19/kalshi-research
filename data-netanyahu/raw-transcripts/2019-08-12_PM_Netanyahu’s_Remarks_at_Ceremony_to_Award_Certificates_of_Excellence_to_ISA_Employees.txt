Prime Minister Netanyahu, at the President’s Residence in Jerusalem, at a ceremony to award certificates of excellence to ISA employees, made the following remarks: “I thank you for your contribution in apprehending the murderers of Dvir Sorek. As soon as we learned the details, I said with great confidence that it would not take much time until we would lay our hands on the murderer. This is what you have done in recent years; all murderers, without exception, have been apprehended. In every case in which vicious murderers have cut down innocent Israeli lives, it has not taken much time for us to find them. You caught Dvir’s murderer within 48 hours. We mapped the terrorists’ homes and will demolish them soon. You work night and day for the well-being of our citizens. In the past year, you thwarted over 600 terrorist attacks. This was a counter-terrorist action of immense scope. We are doing everything to cut off terrorism at its outset.”
