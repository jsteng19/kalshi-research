Following are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting today :

"I would like to turn to all doctors in Israel: You are doing holy work. With your own hands, you save lives on a daily and hourly basis. I would like to turn especially to medical residents. I understand your desire to improve your conditions of employment but none of us, nobody in the State of Israel, is above the law and we must all honor court decisions â€“ because otherwise there would be anarchy here. I call on you: Go back to work immediately and leave the patients out of the struggle.

Less than three months ago,

an agreement was signed

that improves your salaries by tens of percent. No responsible government can countenance a situation in which agreements that were just signed are reopened, and these are long-term agreements that affect the entire economy.

I will continue to accompany the dialogue process and I will make certain that the process will be substantive. Naturally, in this process, not all of your demands will be met, but we will be attentive to improving your working conditions in the framework of the agreement that has been signed.

Our public health system is strong and we are working so that it will continue to be among the strongest in the world. We all need to work together on this important mission."
