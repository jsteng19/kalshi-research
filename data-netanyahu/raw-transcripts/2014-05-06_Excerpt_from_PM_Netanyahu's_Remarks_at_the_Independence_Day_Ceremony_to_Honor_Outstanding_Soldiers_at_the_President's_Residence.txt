Following is an excerpt from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks at the President's Residence in Jerusalem, at the Independence Day ceremony to honor outstanding soldiers:

"I am always proud to be Prime Minister of Israel but I am especially proud today.

Our outstanding soldiers work on land, sea and air to ensure the security of the state. As we send you on missions everywhere I know that there is someone we can rely on.

I would like to thank your parents who raised and educated you to contribute to the state; thank you on behalf of the citizens of Israel."
