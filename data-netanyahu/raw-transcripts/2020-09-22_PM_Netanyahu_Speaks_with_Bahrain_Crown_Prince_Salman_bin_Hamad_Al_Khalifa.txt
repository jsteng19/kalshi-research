Prime Minister Netanyahu spoke with Bahrain Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa.

Following the conversation, Prime Minister Netanyahu made the following remarks:

"For several hours we have been holding very important discussions in the Corona Cabinet on how to stop the surging morbidity, how to reverse it. We will make very important decisions today, or by tomorrow at the latest, and of course we will bring them to you, citizens of Israel.

In the meantime, I was called to an important national need. I had an outstanding, very friendly conversation with Bahrain Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad. We reiterated the principles of the Abraham Accords and we discussed how we might quickly add content to the agreements between Bahrain and Israel and turn this peace into economic peace, technological peace, tourist peace, peace in all of these fields. You will hear about the practical steps very soon."
