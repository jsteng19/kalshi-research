Following are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting, today : "I would like to congratulate our colleague David Amsalem, who is joining the Cabinet table, welcome. Today we are also establishing the Women's Status Ministry, which I initiated as a branch in the government and which we are, today, turning into an official ministry. Welcome Minister May Golan. We are acting against terrorism with all means and we are doing so in two ways: First, we are taking action and confronting the terrorists themselves. In recent months, our forces have eliminated dozens of terrorists and have arrested hundreds more. I give full backing to the Israel Police for thwarting the terrorist on the Temple Mount over the weekend. We are all praying for the well-being of the soldier who was wounded in the ramming attack last night in Gush Etzion. Second, we are exacting a high price from the regimes that support terrorism, beyond Israel's borders. I suggest that our enemies not err. Israel's internal debate will not detract one iota from our determination, strength and ability to act against our enemies on all fronts, wherever and whenever necessary. This week, people of Israel will gather around the Seder table, I would like to remind you all that for centuries on Passover we always remembered that we have a common past of thousands of years as well as a common future expressed in the prayer for next year in a rebuilt Jerusalem. Now, in the rebuilt Jerusalem, we will still remember that we have a glorious past and a bright future â€“ together. I wish the entire people of Israel a happy, kosher and quiet Passover."
