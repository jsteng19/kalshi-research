Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, at the scene of the terrorist attack at Ramot Junction in Jerusalem:

"We are at war, an intense war against terrorism on several fronts.

First, I would like to send condolences to the families of those who were murdered and, of course, best wishes for a quick recovery to those who were wounded.

When I say that we are in an intense war on several fronts, we have had – of course – major successes against the terrorist regimes and terrorist organizations. However, the war is continuing – both in the Gaza Strip, where we will destroy Hamas as we have promised and release our hostages, all of our hostages, and – unfortunately – in Jerusalem as well.

In Judea and Samaria, we have taken very strong action. The ISA, IDF and the Israel Police have thwarted hundreds of terrorist attacks this year but – unfortunately – not this morning.

We are now engaged in pursuit and are cordoning off the villages from which the murderers came. We will apprehend whoever aided and dispatched them, and we will take even stronger steps.

I would like to state as clearly as possible: These murders and attacks, in all sectors, will not weaken us. They will only increase our determination to complete the mission we have taken upon ourselves, in Gaza, Judea and Samaria, and everywhere.

We are fighting terrorism – the terrorist Houthi regime; in Iran, which backs them all; in Gaza in Lebanon; Hezbollah and in all sectors. We are not relenting, nor will we. We will intensify our operations, and we will achieve all of our objectives."
