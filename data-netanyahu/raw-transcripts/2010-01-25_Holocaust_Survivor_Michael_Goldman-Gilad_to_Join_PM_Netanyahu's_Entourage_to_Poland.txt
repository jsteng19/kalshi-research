Holocaust survivor Michael Goldman-Gilad, 84, who survived Auschwitz-Birkenau will be accompanying Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's delegation that is due to leave for Poland this evening.

After the establishment of the State of Israel, Goldman-Gilad immigrated to Israel , enlisted in the Israel Police and joined the special unit that was established to investigate Adolf Eichmann. He served as a personal assistant to Attorney General Gideon Hauser, who prosecuted Eichmann. Today, Goldman-Gilad is a member of the Yad Vashem Council.

Goldman-Gilad said today: "I am very moved by the fact that I was invited to join the Prime Minister's entourage. From a national perspective, as a Jew who suffered at Auschwitz and was sentenced to death, I see this as closing a circle. Personally, the circle is not closed. There is neither consolation nor revenge. There is only the hope that everything has been done so that a strong state of Israel will continue to exist."
