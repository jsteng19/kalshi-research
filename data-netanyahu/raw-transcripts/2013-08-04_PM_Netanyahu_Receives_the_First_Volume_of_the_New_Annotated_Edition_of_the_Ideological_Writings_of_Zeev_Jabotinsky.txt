Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in his Tel Aviv office, received the first volume of a new annotated edition of the ideological writings of Zeev Jabotinsky. The volume, published by the Jabotinsky Institute in Israel, is entitled "Liberal Nationalism" and is a collection of articles written by Jabotinsky toward the end of the 19th century and the early 20th century.

Jabotinsky Institute representatives, including Chairman Mordechai Sarig, Deputy Chairman Amiram Bukspan, board member and Jabotinsky's grand-daughter, Dr. Karni Rubin Jabotinsky and Director General Yossi Ahimeir told Prime Minister Netanyahu that most of the articles in the volume are appearing in Hebrew for the first time and that approximately 20 volumes are planned in the series. They thanked the Prime Minister for the assistance of the Prime Minister's Office in this important literary and Zionist research initiative.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said, "I welcome this initiative which presents the worldview of Zeev Jabotinsky. This volume, which I intend to read soon, is an important element in commemorating his heritage."
