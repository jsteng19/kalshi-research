Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today issued the following statement:

"Approximately two months ago, the Cabinet decided to implement the recommendations of the advisory committee on prayer arrangements at the Western Wall.

Since then, several difficulties have arisen. We are working to resolve them.

I would like to reiterate my commitment to resolve the issue of prayer arrangements at the Western Wall in the aforesaid direction.

To this end, I have decided to appoint the head of the Prime Minister's bureau, David Sharan, to coordinate discussions on this issue with the various elements and to present – within 60 days – a recommendation on the steps necessary to resolve the difficulties, according to the solution that has been proposed."
