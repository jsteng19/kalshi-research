Prime Minister Netanyahu following the visit:

"I am here at the Judea and Samaria Undercover Unit Base. This is our vanguard. They infiltrate, surprise the terrorist enemy, and deal with them. They simply do sacred work on behalf of the State of Israel.

This is always important always but it is especially important now because as we are waging an intense war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, we are aware of the possibility that another larger and more intense front could be opened here in Judea and Samaria.

Therefore, the work of the Border Police unit, the Israel Police and the IDF, in cooperation with our special units, has led to many results on behalf of your security, citizens of Israel."

The Prime Minister was accompanied by his Chief-of-Staff, Tzahi Braverman, his Military Secretary, Maj.-Gen. Roman Gofman, and his Spokesperson, Dr. Omer Dostri.
