Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made the following remarks at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting:

"Israel is calm and self-assured. Israeli citizens know very well that we are prepared for any possible scenario. Israeli citizens must also know that our enemies have very good reasons not to test our strength – they know why.

I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Israel Aerospace Industries and the Spacecom Satellite Communications Ltd. for the successful launch of the Amos IV satellite. There are very few countries in the world that can congratulate themselves on such an achievement. As Prime Minister, I and the ministers here are very proud. This is just one piece of good news that we have had in the past week; there have been others.

Israel climbed to fourth in the health care efficiency index. Our unemployment has declined to 6.3%. We added 21,000 jobs, no mean feat in the current international economic reality. The school year opened normally and parents of 290,000 children, aged 3-4, will save at least NIS 8,000 per annum thanks to the free education plan from age 3 that we enacted. Also, no illegal migrants crossed the border in August. The fence has completely blocked illegal migration – also an extraordinary achievement.

This week the Jewish People will celebrate Rosh Hashanah in Israel and around the world. I wish the entire Jewish People a good and blessed year. We will continue to strengthen our security. We will continue to develop the State of Israel. We will see to it that all Israeli citizens will have a good and safe year!"
