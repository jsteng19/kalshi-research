Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today: "Israel views with utmost gravity the shooting at our forces by Hezbollah. We will not tolerate any aggression against our citizens and we will respond forcefully to any attack against us. I suggest that Hezbollah not try the crushing force of Israel. Hezbollah is once again endangering Lebanon with its aggression." Prime Minister Netanyahu held consultations overnight with the Defense Minister, the IDF Chief-of-Staff and other senior officials.
