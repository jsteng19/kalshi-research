Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, praised the IDF operation to enforce the naval blockade on the Gaza Strip in keeping with international law. "Even the people who were on the ship know that there is no humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Their entire objective was to create a provocation and blacken Israel's name. If human rights were really important to these activists, they would sail to Syria. We will continue to take strong and determined action to defend our borders," the Prime Minister said.
