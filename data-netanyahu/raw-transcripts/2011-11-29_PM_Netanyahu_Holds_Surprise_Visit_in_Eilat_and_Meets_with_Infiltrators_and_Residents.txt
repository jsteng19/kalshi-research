Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this evening held a surprise visit to the Ye'elim neighborhood of Eilat.

After concluding his appearance at the State Attorney's Office conference in Eilat, Prime Minister Netanyahu asked to see firsthand the plight of the city's residents in wake of the mass infiltration across Israel's southern border.

Prime Minister Netanyahu met with infiltrators and asked them about the way in which they entered Israel and the goal of their arrival. He also spoke with neighborhood residents who have complained about the problems created by the infiltrators and promised them that, "Within less than a year the southern border fence will be completed. This will significantly reduce infiltrations. This is in addition to other moves, such as expanding the holding facility."

Prime Minister Netanyahu was accompanied by Attorney General Yehuda Weinstein, Justice Ministry Director-General Dr. Chaim Falkopf and Eilat Mayor Meir Yitzhak Halevy.

Earlier, at the State Attorney's Office conference, Prime Minister Netanyahu said that infiltrators from Africa are arriving in order to find work and they are not refugees. "Despite the global upheaval, which obligates us to act with economic responsibility, there will be a budgetary supplement to complete the fence, according to the timetable that we determined, in less than a year. I have already inspected progress on the fence's construction three times."
