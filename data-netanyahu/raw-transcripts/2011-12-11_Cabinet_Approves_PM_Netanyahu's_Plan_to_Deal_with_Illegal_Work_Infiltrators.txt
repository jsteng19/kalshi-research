The Cabinet today unanimously approved

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plan to deal with illegal work infiltrators

All Government ministries will share in financing the NIS 630 million cost of the plan (2% from each ministry). The new plan's main emphasis is on stepping up enforcement and increasing the fines levied on those who employ illegal work infiltrators. According to draft legislation that will be submitted to the Knesset, corporations that employ illegal work infiltrators may be fined NIS 75,000; certain cases may entail closing the business. The law will be amended so as to extend the detention of illegal work infiltrators from 60 days to three years.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said that, "If need be, we will close businesses so that the enterprise known as the State of Israel does not close. I thank ministers for offering their ministries' budgetary support in order to deal quickly with this phenomenon, which endangers the economy, society and Israeli citizens' security."
