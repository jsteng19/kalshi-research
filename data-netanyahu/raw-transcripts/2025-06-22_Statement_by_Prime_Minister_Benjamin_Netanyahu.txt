Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today:

"In an ISA and IDF operation in the Gaza Strip, the bodies of three of our hostages, which had been held by the murderous Hamas terrorist organization, have been returned to Israel: Yonatan Samerano, Staff Sgt. Shai Levinson and Ofra Kedar, who were murdered and taken hostage on 7 October 2023.

Together with all citizens of Israel, my wife and I convey our heartfelt condolences to the dear families, and share in their deep sorrow.

I thank the commander and our fighters for the successful action, their determination and their courage.

The campaign to return the hostages is ongoing and is continuing in parallel to our campaign against Iran.

We will not rest until we return home all of our hostages, the living and the deceased."
