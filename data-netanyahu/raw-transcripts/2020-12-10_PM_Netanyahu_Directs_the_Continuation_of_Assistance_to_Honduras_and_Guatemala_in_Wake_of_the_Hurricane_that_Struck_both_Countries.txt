Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this morning, directed Prime Minister's Office personnel to continue the assistance the State of Israel is providing to Honduras and Guatemala via an additional financial allocation that was transferred to the Israeli embassy in Guatemala, which will carry out the necessary procurements for the two countries. Prime Minister Netanyahu recently spoke with Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez, at the latter's request, who requested humanitarian assistance from Israel in dealing with hurricane damage. The State of Israel initially transferred emergency assistance to Honduras and Guatemala for the purchase of emergency goods. This is alongside the humanitarian assistance that Israel has provided Honduras in cooperation with the Jewish community, including – inter alia – clothing, food and hygiene products. An IDF Home Front Command mission recently left for Honduras in order to provide assistance in meeting the needs of hurricane victims.
