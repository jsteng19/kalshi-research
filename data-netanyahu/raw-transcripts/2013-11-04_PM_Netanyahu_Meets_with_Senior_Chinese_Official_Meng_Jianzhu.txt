Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with Communist Party of China Central Committee Political Bureau member Meng Jianzhu. The Prime Minister told him that the pressure on Iran must not be relaxed, and that in the talks between the major powers and Iran, Iran must not be allowed to retain centrifuges and a heavy water reactor, which are used to produce nuclear weapons.

At the start of their meeting, Prime Minister Netanyahu welcomed Meng Jianzhu to Jerusalem and said that the latter's visit was a sign of the rapidly improving relations between Israel and China. The Prime Minister added that there were very many areas in which the two countries could cooperate and noted that Israel would be very pleased to do so.
