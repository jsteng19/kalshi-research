Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the framework of the Turning Point 5 home front exercise, visited the IDF Home Front Command base in Ramla and made the following remarks:

"Like all citizens of Israel, I am participating in the exercise, which includes the sounding of warning sirens.

We are operating on a very broad spectrum and are certainly impressed by the improvements. There is very systematic and intensive work here to protect the Israeli home front. We have been doing this for years.

This found expression in very good protection during Operation Protective Edge. However, challenges are constantly mounting all around us – inter alia – by missiles and rockets, almost all of which are supplied by Iran.

When it comes to Israel's security, I rely, first of all, on ourselves; evidence of this is the agreement being formulated between the major powers and Iran, which is paving Iran's way to many atomic bombs and is also channeling many billions into Iran's coffers.

With this money, Iran will be able to continue arming our enemies with rockets and other weapons and arm its own war and terror machine as well. The latter operates against us and against the Middle East and is many times more dangerous than Islamic State's terror machine, which is also very dangerous.

Therefore, we will do whatever we can to safeguard Israel's security. We will continue to protect the home front and the citizens of Israel, as we are doing in this exercise."
