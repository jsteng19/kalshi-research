Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening:

"I have just finished an assessment of the situation, as well as the approval of operational plans, with the Defense Minister, the IDF Chief-of-Staff, the head of the ISA, the head of the Mossad and the head of the National Security Council. The directive is to continue striking at the terrorist targets. The IDF is doing this very well. Today, it targeted a senior Islamic Jihad commander. We struck at the Hamas naval unit and we are continuing to strike at underground targets â€“ Hamas's "metro" and there are other targets. We will continue to operate as long as needed to restore quiet and security to all Israelis.
