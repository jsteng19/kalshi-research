Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made the following remarks:

"After months of efforts that I have led, today we have a very important achievement: Hungary has decided to open in Jerusalem a diplomatic branch of its embassy, and Slovakia has decided to open an innovation and cultural center in Jerusalem. This follows the Czech Republic announcement that it is opening a Czech House in Jerusalem. These are efforts that have borne fruit."
