Following is an excerpt from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks at a ceremony to mark 100 years since the death of NILI heroine Sarah Aaronsohn:

"I would like to commend the statement by the American administration in Washington. I am pleased that President Trump's envoy, Jason Greenblatt, made it very clear that Hamas must be disarmed, Israel must be recognized and previous international decisions must be honored. They made it clear that any Palestinian government needs to be committed to these principles.

We want peace; we want a genuine peace and because of this, we will not conduct negotiations with a terrorist organization in diplomatic disguise."
