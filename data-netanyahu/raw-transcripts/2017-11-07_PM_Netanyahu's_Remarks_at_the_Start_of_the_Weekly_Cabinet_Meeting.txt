Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, at the Cabinet meeting today made the following remarks:

"Over the years the Jewish National Fund has done many important things on behalf of the Jewish People and the State of Israel. But today it is clearer than ever that the future of the Jewish People is strongly bound to the future of the State of Israel.

It is here that the fate and future of the Jewish People will be decided. The needs of the State of Israel are many. The JNF sells lands every year and receives billions of shekels in return. It is very important that this money be channeled to the needs of the State of Israel. These needs cannot wait. This is the nature of our meeting today and we make decisions."
