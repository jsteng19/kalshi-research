Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this morning:

"The Air Force has attacked the airport in Sanaa again, which is controlled by the Houthi terrorist regime in Yemen.

We work according to a simple rule: Whoever harms us, we harm them. Whoever does not understand this with force, will now understand it with greater force.

But, as I have said more than once: The Houthis are only the symptom. The main driving force behind them is Iran, which is responsible for the aggression emanating from Yemen."
