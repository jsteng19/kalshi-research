Prime Minister Netanyahu made the following remarks at the start of a meeting of the ministerial committee on advancing the integration into Israeli society of Israeli citizens of Ethiopian origin: "The death of Salomon Tekah was a major tragedy. Our heart is with the family and lessons will also be learned. But one thing is clear: We cannot tolerate the violence that we saw yesterday. We cannot see the violent blocking of roads. We cannot see firebombs, and attacks on police officers, citizens and private property. This is inconceivable and the police are deployed accordingly to prevent this. I called you here today, first of all, because you are public representatives. We have worked together and we have achieved important things for the Ethiopian community in the country and we still have work to do. But the first thing that I ask and expect is that you will use your influence in order to help stop this violence. It must stop immediately. We have other things to discuss but this is the first thing and I hope that we will succeed."
