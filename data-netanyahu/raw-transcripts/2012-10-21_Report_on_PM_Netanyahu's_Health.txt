As he does every year, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu informs the public on the state of his health.

After the Prime Minister underwent routine annual tests (a physical test and lab tests), his personal physician, Dr. Zvi Herman Berkowitz, has determined that his medical situation is excellent.

Prime Minister Netanyahu maintains a healthy lifestyle, including a proper diet. His blood pressure is 120/80, assisted by light medication. (This is unchanged from previous years.) He has recovered from a torn tendon in his leg; it has been recommended that he continue physiotherapy and gradually return to exercising in a gym.
