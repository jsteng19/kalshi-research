Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today made the following remarks at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting:

"The Middle East is going through an especially sensitive period of shocks and upheavals in many sectors. While we have no interest in being party to the conflicts around us, we are acting and we are committed to prevent dangers to Israel's security, and we have a clear policy of responding to attempted attacks against our territory. Also, I would like to strongly condemn recent phenomena of racism against Israeli Arabs and hooliganism against Palestinians, which were without any provocation or justification whatsoever. We strongly reject these phenomena and will act with all legal means at our disposal to stop them."
