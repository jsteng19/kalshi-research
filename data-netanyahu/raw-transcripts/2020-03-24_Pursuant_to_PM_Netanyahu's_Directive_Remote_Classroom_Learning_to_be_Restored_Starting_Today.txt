Pursuant to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's directive to restore remote classroom learning, a meeting was held yesterday evening with the participation of Prime Minister's Office Director General Ronen Peretz, Finance Ministry Director General Shai Babad, Education Ministry Director General Shmuel Abuav, Finance Ministry Wages Director Koby Bar-Natan and Teacher's Union Secretary General Yafa Ben-David. Following hours of discussion, it was agreed that the Teacher's Union management would, today (Wednesday, 25 March 2020), approve Prime Minister Netanyahu's proposed outline to facilitate the immediate restoration of remote learning. In the framework of the agreements, it was determined that teachers, in the entire education system, from kindergartens through 10th grade (including primary and middle schools) would receive full salaries by the end of Passover. Starting today, teachers will return to remote learning; only nine days will be returned during the summer.
