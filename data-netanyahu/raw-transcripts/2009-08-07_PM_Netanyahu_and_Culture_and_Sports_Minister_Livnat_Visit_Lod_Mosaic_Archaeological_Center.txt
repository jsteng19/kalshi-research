Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Culture and Sports Minister Limor Livnat today, visited the Lod Mosaic Archaeological Center and viewed the Roman-era mosaic floor, one of the most impressive that has been discovered in Israel.

The 180-meter mosaic was discovered approximately 13 years ago during work to lay electric cables in Lod. It was covered over due to a lack of funds. The Israel Antiquities Authority is currently carrying out work to preserve the mosaic ahead of its presentation to visitors.
