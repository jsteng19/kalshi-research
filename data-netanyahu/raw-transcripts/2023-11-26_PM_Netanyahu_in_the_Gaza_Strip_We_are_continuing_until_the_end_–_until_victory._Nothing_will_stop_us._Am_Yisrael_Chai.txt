Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, visited in the Gaza Strip, where he received security briefings with commanders and soldiers and visited one of the tunnels that has been revealed.

The Prime Minister was accompanied by his Chief of Staff, Tzachi Braverman, National Security Council Director Tzachi Hanegbi, his Military Secretary, Maj.-Gen. Avi Gil, and IDF Deputy Chief-of-Staff Maj.-Gen. Amir Baram.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"We are here in the Gaza Strip with our heroic soldiers. We are making every effort to return our hostages, and in the end we will return them all. We have three goals in this war: Eliminate Hamas, return all of our hostages and ensure that Gaza will not go back to being a threat to the State of Israel.

I am here to tell the soldiers, who all tell me the same thing, and I repeat it to you, citizens of Israel: We are continuing until the end â€“ until victory. Nothing will stop us, and we are convinced that we have the force, the strength, the will and the determination to achieve all of our goals for the war, and this is what we will do.

I sat with the IDF Deputy Chief of Staff and the commanders. On the wall it was written: 'Am Israel Chai' [The People of Israel Live]. Then Am Yisrael Chai and the people of Israel will also win thanks to you. Thank you."
