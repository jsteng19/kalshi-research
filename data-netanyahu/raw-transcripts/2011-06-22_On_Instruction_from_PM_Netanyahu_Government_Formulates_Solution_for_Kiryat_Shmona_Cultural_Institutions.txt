In accordance with instructions from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister's Office has formulated a solution to allow the continuation of activities at the

Kiryat Shmona

cultural center, library and auditorium. The decision will be submitted for Cabinet approval at its next meeting.

According to the decision, NIS 6 million in Government assistance will be allocated to community centers in areas near borders and in towns under threat, which have become insolvent. The goal of the support is to allow bodies such as the Kiryat Shmona community center, to resolve its debts so that educational and cultural activities that benefit area residents might continue.

The proposal was formulated in cooperation with the ministries of Education, Finance, Interior, Negev and Galilee Development, and Culture and Sports.

Prime Minister Netanyahu told the Cabinet on Sunday, 19.6.11

, that he would, within a week, submit an agreed-upon plan to resolve the issue of Kiryat Shmona's cultural institutions.
