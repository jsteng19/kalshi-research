Prime Minister Netanyahu will, at the weekly Cabinet meeting, submit for Cabinet approval, a draft decision to allocate NIS 30 million to Nahariya for repairing damages from the recent flooding. During his visit earlier this week to Nahariya, Prime Minister Netanyahu directed Prime Minister's Office Acting Director General Ronen Peretz to prepare a government plan for repairing flood damage in Nahariya. The plan, which was formulated together with Interior, Tourism, Housing and Construction, Energy, Environmental Protection and Finance ministers, includes budgets for the immediate rehabilitation of the city, financing of urgent activities, evacuation of hazards and the upgrading of infrastructures that were damaged in the flooding. The decision includes designated budgets for the Nahariya municipality to assist in covering the emergency expenses that it incurred in dealing with the flooding and the immediate rehabilitation of damaged areas. The government will also work to repair, improve and upgrade infrastructures, and develop streets, that were damaged in the storm, as well as repair public tourist infrastructures that were damaged along the beaches and adjacent to local hotels. The Cabinet will decide to advance and complete planning procedures for a drainage plan and to establish flooding control areas along the upper Gaaton stream in order to prevent a recurrence of such events. The Cabinet will also establish a steering team to assist in removing impediments to the plans and ensuring their completion on time.
