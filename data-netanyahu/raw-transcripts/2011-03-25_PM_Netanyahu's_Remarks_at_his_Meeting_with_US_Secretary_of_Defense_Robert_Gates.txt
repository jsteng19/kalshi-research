Following are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks at his meeting with US Secretary of Defense Robert Gates today:

"I welcome this opportunity to speak with US Secretary of Defense Robert Gates on a series of issues related to security and the efforts to ensure quiet here. We have joint interests and, as the Defense Secretary said, very concrete and developed cooperation as well in various security, intelligence and anti-missile defense issues, which we will advance in our present talks.

Recently, Israel has been under a terrorist- and missile-assault.

I heard President Obama's remarks yesterday when he phoned me in Moscow, during my talks with Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin

. President Obama was very clear and supportive. He sent his best wishes to those who were wounded in the terrorist actions and said simply: The US stands with you in the struggle against terrorism. I heard similar remarks from

Russian Prime Minister Putin

and from

Russian President Dmitry Medvedev

, and from Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. We also hear similar remarks from other countries as well.

Civilized peoples are struggling against this sickness and this evil called terrorism â€“ intentional, direct and brutal attacks against innocent civilians. No country would tolerate such attacks. Israel will not tolerate these attacks. We are prepared to respond with all our might in order to stop this terrorism; we will put a stop to it."
