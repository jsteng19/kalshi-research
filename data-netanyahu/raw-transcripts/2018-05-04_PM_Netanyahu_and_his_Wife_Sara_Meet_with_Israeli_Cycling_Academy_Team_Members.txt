Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara, this morning, met with members of Israeli Cycling Academy team, who are competing in the Giro d'Italia, ahead of the start of the race in Jerusalem later in the day. Culture and Sport Minister Miri Regev also attended the meeting.

"We are very excited by this competition. This is the first time that the Giro is being held outside Europe, in Israel. This is a great honor. This is the first time that an Israeli team is participating in this competition. We wish it great success and pedaling for Zion.

We are very pleased that bicyclists have come here from all over the world, including the Arab world. This is a very important message from Jerusalem, our city, the city of peace.

The fact that you are here now is already a victory. This is very important. We wish you great success.

We have always proven that we can do much more than what is expected. You are starting out and we are all with you. If we could, the entire people of Israel would stand behind you and give you a push. You should have great success. We are here in the Tower of David [Museum]. As one might say, we were on the map and now we are on the map again."

An Israeli team rider said, "We will do our utmost in order to represent Israel with honor and I hope it will go well."
