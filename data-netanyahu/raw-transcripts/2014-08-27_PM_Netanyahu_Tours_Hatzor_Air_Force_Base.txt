Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon and IDF Chief-of-Staff Lt.-Gen. Benny Gantz, toured the Hatzor Air Force Base, where they received a security briefing from GOC Air Force Maj.-Gen. Amir Eshel and met with – inter alia –pilots and Iron Dome battery personnel.

In a conversation with pilots, Prime Minister Netanyahu said, "The air force carried out its missions very well. You operated in a manner that inspires amazement; this was extraordinary. You reached the summit of achievements by the world's air forces and there are new and unprecedented things here. There was a very major breakthrough here but the most important thing is that we have the tools to defend the country and attack the enemy. You have the nation's gratitude."
