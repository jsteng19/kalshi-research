Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this morning, to mark International holocaust Remembrance Day, invited Moshe Haelyon, Mordecai (Motka) Weisel and Malka Steinmetz to his office in Jerusalem.

Prime Minister Netanyahu heard the survivors' personal stories from during World War II and regarding their immigration to Israel, and said that their story was that of the state and its revival.

Afterwards, the Prime Minister invited the three to join him at the weekly Cabinet meeting and hear the Cabinet briefing on the subject.

"Today we mark International Holocaust Remembrance Day and Struggle against Anti-Semitism Day. We are honored with the presence of Moshe, Malka and Motka, Holocaust survivors that I just met before the meeting.

Moshe survived the death camps and the death march. Malka lost her five sisters in the crematoria and has a number burned onto her arm. Motka, whose brother fell at Latrun, interrupted an SS officer who whipped his back. The penalty for such an offense was immediate death, but he somehow survived. By this unbelievable act of heroism he served as an example to thousands. The story spread among thousands and he served as an example to thousands, and to us. The moving stories of the revival of Moshe, Malka and Motka are the story of our revival.

During the Holocaust, the Jewish people were completely helpless. Today the state of the Jews is among the strongest and most advanced in the world. First and foremost, we have restored to our people the strength to resist that we lost in exile. In contrast to the terrible helplessness of our people then, today we strike at those who seek our lives and hurt all those who try to hurt us. At the same time, we do not forget our dead, our enemies and our rescuers."
