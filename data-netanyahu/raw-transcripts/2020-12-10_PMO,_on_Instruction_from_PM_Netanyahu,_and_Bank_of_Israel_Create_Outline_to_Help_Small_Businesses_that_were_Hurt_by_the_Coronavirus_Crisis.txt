The Prime Minister's Office, on instruction from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and the Bank of Israel have worked together to create an outline that will enable businesses that have been hurt by the coronavirus crisis to defer repayment of the loans that they took before the crisis. The move will enable small and micro- businesses that were significantly hurt by the crisis and which meet the cumulative conditions to defer, without consideration by the bank, the fund's component of the loan. This deferment is expected to lead to a reduction in the monthly payment by over 70%. The deferment will be carried out, without consideration by the bank, for a period of up to one year (according to the customer's choice), in loans of up to NIS 500,000 and for a period of up to six months (according to the customer's choice) in loans over NIS 500 million. Prime Minister Netanyahu: "This is an additional step that we have brought recently to significantly help small and micro- businesses â€“ quickly and smoothly, without delays. We will continue to assist small businesses at this complex time." National Economic Council head Prof. Avi Simhon: "This is very important news for tens of thousands of businesses that were hurt by the coronavirus crisis and which will now receive time in order to repay the loans they took out before the crisis."
