Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made the following remarks at the security Cabinet meeting today:

This was no peace flotilla but a violent and planned force

. We have

film and pictures

that underscore what our soldiers faced and the last thing that could possibly be said about that ship is that it was a peace ship. Today, I visited the wounded fighters at the

Chaim Sheba Medical Center at Tel Hashomer

and I heard from them waiting for them on the deck of the ship were terrorists armed with cold weapons such as axes, knives, clubs, bars and the like, and it is likely that they also snatched weapons. Our soldiers acted against them with equanimity and heroism. We regret the loss of life â€“ but give full backing to the soldiers and to the IDF regarding this action."

Prime Minister Netanyahu explained why it is necessary to check ships transporting equipment and people to Gaza:

"We know from the experience of

Operation Cast Lead

, and from before it, that war materiel which enters Gaza is directed against our citizens. In Gaza is an Iranian-sponsored terrorist state; therefore, we try to prevent the entry of war materiel into Gaza, whether by land, sea or air. True, they smuggle war materiel through tunnels but smuggling via the sea is completely different, quantitatively. On the

Francop

alone, we captured approximately 200 tons of war materiel smuggled from Iran to Hezbollah. Opening a sea route into Gaza would constitute a great danger to the security of our citizens. Therefore, we persist with a naval blockade and check the ships. There is no possibility of maintaining this policy without checking ships' cargoes. True, there is international pressure and criticism of this policy but we must understand that it is vital in order to maintain Israel's security and Israel's right to defend itself."
