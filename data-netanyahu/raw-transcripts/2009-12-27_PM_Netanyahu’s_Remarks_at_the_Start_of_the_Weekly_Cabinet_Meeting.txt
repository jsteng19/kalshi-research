Following are excerpts from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting today :

"I would like to commend the ISA and the IDF for

the quick operation against the cell that murdered Rabbi Meir Avshalom Hai

. Our policy against terrorism is clear. We will continue to respond aggressively – against any attack on Israeli citizens and against any firing of rockets or missiles at Israeli territory.

(…).

"I add and update members of the Government that on Tuesday, I will meet Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Egypt, at my request. I think that we have an interest in advancing the peace process in various ways. Omar Suleiman was here last week. I met with him and other officials and I intend to continue this important dialogue. I have also asked Minister Ben-Eliezer to join me on this trip."
