Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening:

"I had a good and important meeting today with Secretary of State Blinken. I greatly appreciate the efforts that the US is making in regional defense against the Iranian axis. This is important, of course, for the State of Israel.

I also greatly appreciate the understanding that the US has shown for our vital security interests as part of our joint efforts to bring about the release of our hostages.

I would like to emphasize: The efforts to release a maximum number of living hostages â€“ already in the first stage of the deal."
