PM Netanyahu's Remarks Following the Corona Cabinet Meeting"Today, I reported to the Corona Cabinet that I spoke last night with Pfizer Chairman and CEO Albert Bourla. Together with the legal advisers of both sides, we removed the last obstacle to signing a contract between Pfizer and Israel for the supply of vaccines to Israel.

We will receive these vaccines like the other leading countries of the world. It will start in January and will grow from month to month. We are working, and I am working, to bring vaccines from other sources as well. The more, the better.

However, it must be understood that this will take time throughout the world; we need to follow the rules. I insist that the exit from the restrictions be done gradually and responsibly. I want to open up the economy, commerce and everything else no less than others, but we must do so responsibly because otherwise we will simply go back to where we were.

Today, we are in a very good place, many countries would like to trade places with us, regarding both vaccines and day-to-day because our level of morbidity is lower than in Europe and we need to keep it that way. Therefore, the opening will be done in this manner, when we open something, we subtract something in order to reduce the danger of morbidity.

Today I asked that I be provided with an orderly plan regarding the red cities that will enable us to open up the rest of the country, and we are also evaluating other possibilities. We will do this responsibly in order to safeguard your lives and health, citizens of Israel, and to facilitate the economy and education. With G-d's help, we will succeed.

I would like to thank Ronni Gamzu for his dedicated service to the State of Israel, in difficult times, and I would also like to wish his replacement, Nachman Ash, success in the position, a difficult position."
