Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made the following remarks earlier today after returning from Washington, DC:

"The visit was important. We found broad American support for Israel's fundamental claims especially the recognition of Israel as the national state of the Jewish People, and the need for secure borders and the complete repudiation of Hamas. The great majority of people in Israel are united around

the broad diplomatic outline that I proposed in the US

. The time has come for the Zionist parties to unite around these principles. The time has also come for the Palestinian Authority to recognize Israel's just claims."
