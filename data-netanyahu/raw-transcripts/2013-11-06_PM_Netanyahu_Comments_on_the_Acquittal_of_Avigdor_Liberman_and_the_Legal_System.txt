Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made the following remarks:

"I congratulate Avigdor Liberman on his unanimous acquittal. This ends a long, drawn out affair, not only for Avigdor Liberman but for his family as well. We have been friends for many years and have worked together in government for many years and I am pleased that Avigdor will be coming back to work with me at the Cabinet table.

I would also like to say something today about the law enforcement system in Israel. The law enforcement system and the Attorney General are doing excellent and dedicated work but in the end it is the courts that decide. How awful it would be if we had a society in which every indictment ended in conviction. Therefore, for the strength of Israeli democracy, we must all continue to respect the judicial and law enforcement systems."
