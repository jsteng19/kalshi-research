Following is an additional excerpt from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks today, at the state memorial ceremony for Yosef Trumpeldor and his comrades who fell in defense of Tel Hai:

"On the eve of Purim, I would like to say to those who seek our lives, Iran and its proxies in the Middle East: 2,500 years ago, another Persian villain tried to destroy the Jewish people and just as he failed then, so too will you fail today. We will not allow your extremist and aggressive regime to attain nuclear weapons. We have not made the journey of generations, of thousands of years, to return to the land of Israel in order to allow the delusional regime of the ayatollahs to end the story of the revival of the Jewish people.

We are not pinning our hopes on any agreement with an extremist regime such as yours. We have already seen the quality of agreements with extremist regimes such as yours, in the past century and in this one, with the government of North Korea. With or without agreements â€“ we will do everything so that you will not arm yourselves with nuclear weapons."
