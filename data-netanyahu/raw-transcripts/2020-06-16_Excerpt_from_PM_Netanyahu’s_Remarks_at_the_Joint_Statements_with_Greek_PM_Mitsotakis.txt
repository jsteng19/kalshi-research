Following is an excerpt (translated from the Hebrew) from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s remarks, today, at the joint statements with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, at the start of the fourth G2G meeting between the governments of Israel and Greece: “We are talking here about a target date of 1 August for opening the skies, to the destinations of Greece and Cyprus. This also depends on what happens with the corona pandemic but if the numbers allow it, this is the target gate for opening the skies. This is very important news.”
