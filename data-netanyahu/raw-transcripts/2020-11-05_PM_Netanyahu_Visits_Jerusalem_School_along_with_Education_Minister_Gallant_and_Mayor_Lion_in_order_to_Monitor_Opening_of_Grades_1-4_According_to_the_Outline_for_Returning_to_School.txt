Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Education Minister Yoav Gallant and Jerusalem Mayor Mosher Lion, this morning, visited the Tali School in the Jerusalem neighborhood of Beit V'gan, in order to monitor the opening of grades 1-4 in accordance with the outline for returning to school.

Prime Minister Netanyahu met 4th grade pupils and was briefed by the school principal on the preparations that were made ahead of the return to classes.

Prime Minister Netanyahu after his talk with the pupils:

"I am pleased to see the school working and teaching children five days a week. I see that the children know the rules, are maintaining distance and are wearing masks. I hope that they are also washing their hands. This is a necessary condition; to the extent that it is maintained, we will be able to open more according to the procedures that we will discuss today. Mr. Mayor, I would like to thank you and the Education Minister for the excellent cooperation, and not just in Jerusalem but in many other places as well.

Yesterday we decided to open street commerce on Sunday. I know the merchants' distress. We decided to help them; however, we know that there could be an increase in morbidity. Not just because of this, but mainly because of this, morbidity has increased as we have opened. We learned from the exit from the first lockdown, that in the second lockdown we would exit more slowly, and if need be we will also stop, and we are evaluating this according to the morbidity.

The most important thing is your cooperation, citizens of Israel â€“ the masks, the distancing and avoiding gatherings. With G-d's help, we will overcome this until the arrival of the vaccines that we have been working on without respite."
