Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attended a toast for the Jewish New Year with Foreign Ministry personnel. Following are excerpts from his remarks:

"At my meeting yesterday with the Albanian Foreign Minister it was suggested that we hold a meeting in Albania of the six western Balkan countries. We have just done this with the three Baltic states. This gives us considerable output in a relatively concentrated effort. Again, I would like to thank you for the help on this issue. These alliances are significant and embrace the world. We need to move them forward even as we fight not just to advance our interests, which are the interests not only of those who cooperate with us but of justice and the truth as well. We have an especially difficult struggle for justice and the truth vis-a-vis the European Union in Brussels.

The agreement with Iran was a bad agreement in every respect except for one â€“ it brought us closer to the Arab world on a scale that we never knew, and one of our goals is that it continues. I think that another important thing is, of course, the fact that there is a gradual normalization with leading countries in the Arab world.

We are in a process of diplomatic flourishing. We are also in a struggle for justice and the truth and I think that we are in a process of gradual normalization which in the end heralds a genuine opening for peace.

I want to thank you for the great work that goes on here and around the world. The world is coming here and we are going to the world, and our joint work has brought about a flourishing, a diplomatic flourishing that is unprecedented in the history of Israel."
