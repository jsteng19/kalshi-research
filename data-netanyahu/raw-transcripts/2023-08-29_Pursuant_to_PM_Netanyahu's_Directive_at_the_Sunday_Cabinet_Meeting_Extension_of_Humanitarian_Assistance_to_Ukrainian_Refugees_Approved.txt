The Cabinet, today , in a teleconference vote, approved a 0.06% across-the-board cut in the 2023 fiscal year budgets for the Government ministries so that the Ministry of Welfare and Social Affairs may continue – until the end of the year – to provide humanitarian assistance to Ukrainian nationals who fled the war in their country and are ineligible under the Law of Return, in order to maintain continuity of coverage from 9 August 2023, as per the relevant procedures that have been set. The decision regarding the continued provision of assistance and its method of financing beyond 2023 will be submitted in a separate Government decision.
