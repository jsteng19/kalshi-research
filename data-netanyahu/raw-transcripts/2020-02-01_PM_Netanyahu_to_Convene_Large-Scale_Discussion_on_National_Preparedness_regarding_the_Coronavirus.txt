Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will, tomorrow (Sunday, 2 February 2020), convene a large-scale discussion – with the participation of ministers, ministry director generals and all relevant staff officials (see below) – on national preparedness regarding the coronavirus. This will be pursuant to the discussion that was held early this past week and the continuous updates received by the Prime Minister and Prime Minister's Office personnel. The State of Israel has already taken preventive measures and was among the first countries that decided to restrict flights and land entry for those coming from China. Prime Minister Netanyahu: "We are not taking any unnecessary chances. The virus is already found on five continents and in over 25 countries. We are aware of the fact that it will be impossible to completely prevent the entry of the virus; therefore, we will be prepared in advance to deal with the virus after its first entry to Israel." Among those participating in tomorrow's meeting: the ministers of Health, Finance, Foreign Affairs, Justice, Interior and Transportation and the director generals of their ministries; the head of the National Security Council, the Director of the Biological Institute, the head of the Public Health Service and the head of the Health Ministry Medical Division; the head of the Population Authority, the director general of the Civil Aviation Authority, the director general of MDA, the Finance Ministry Accountant General, IDF Home Front Command and the IDF Chief Medical Officer.
