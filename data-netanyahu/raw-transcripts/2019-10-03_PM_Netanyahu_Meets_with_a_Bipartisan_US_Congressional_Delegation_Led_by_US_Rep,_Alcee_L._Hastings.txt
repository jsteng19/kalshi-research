Prime Minister Netanyahu, at the Prime Minister’s Office in Jerusalem, with a bipartisan US Congressional delegation led by US Rep. Alcee L. Hastings (D-FL), who also chairs the US Helsinki Commission. Following is an excerpt from Prime Minister Netanyahu’s remarks: “I do want to thank you for your consistent support, broad-based support – very important for us. The bipartisan support for Israel is a mainstay of our national security. It is not something that we just say pro forma. It is deep and abiding.”
