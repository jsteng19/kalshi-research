Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made the following remarks at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting today:

"In 2013, according to official data, there was the lowest number of terrorist attacks in a decade. This is not coincidental. It is the product of a very clear policy of responsive and preventive action, a quick response and continuous preventive action against those who seek to do us harm.

According to the latest report, unemployment in 2013 reached 5.5%. This was in continuation of the economic policy that we led over the past four years prior to this government's year [in office] and it is most welcome.

In addition to security and the economy, in 2013 we saw a complete halt to the phenomenon of illegal migration into Israel and, at the same time, a six-fold increase in the number of illegal migrants who left Israel, over 2,600. I would like to emphasize that these are not refugees, but people who are breaking the law and whom we will deal with to the fullest extent of the law.

At today's meeting, we will discuss the periodic index of incitement in the Palestinian Authority. To my regret, this incitement is continuing. We have seen examples in recent days. Opposition to recognizing the Jewish state and our right to be here is continuing. We are not foreigners in Jerusalem, Beit El or Hebron. I reiterate that in my view, this is the root of both the conflict and the incitement, the non-recognition of this basic fact."
