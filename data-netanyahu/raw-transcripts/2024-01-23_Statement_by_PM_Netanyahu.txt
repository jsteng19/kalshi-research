Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this morning:

"Yesterday we experienced one of the most difficult days since the outbreak of the war.

I would like to stand by the dear families of our heroic fighters who fell on the battlefield. I know that for these families, their lives will change forever.

I mourn our heroic fallen soldiers. I embrace the families in their hour of sorrow and we all pray for the well-being of those who were wounded.

The IDF has opened an inquiry into the tragedy. We must learn the necessary lessons and do everything to safeguard the lives of our fighters.

On behalf of our heroes, for our very lives, we will not stop fighting until total victory."
