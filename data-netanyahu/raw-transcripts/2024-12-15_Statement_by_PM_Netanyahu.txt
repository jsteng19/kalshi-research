Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening: "The onslaught of Hamas propaganda videos is cruel and malicious psychological warfare. I am in continuous contact with the hostages' families who are enduring a terrible and prolonged nightmare. I have said and I reiterate: Whoever harms our hostages â€“ will pay the price. We will continue to work relentlessly for the return home of all of our male and female hostages, the living and the deceased."
