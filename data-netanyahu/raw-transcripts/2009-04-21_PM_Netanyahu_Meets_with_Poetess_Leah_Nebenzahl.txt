Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today Holocaust Martyrs' and Heroes' Remembrance Day, met with poetess and Holocaust survivor Leah Nebenzahl, who read one of her poems during the "Unto Every Person There is a Name" ceremony at the Knesset.

Prime Minister Netanyahu was very moved by the poem and invited her and her family to meet with him in order to hear the story of her life. Leah Nebenzahl's parents were murdered in the Holocaust and she was adopted by a Polish couple that had no children. After the war, she was located by her aunt and managed to leave Poland and emigrate to Israel.
