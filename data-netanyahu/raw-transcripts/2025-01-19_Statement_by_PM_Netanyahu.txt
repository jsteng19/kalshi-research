Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this morning:

"In a special IDF and ISA operation, before the ceasefire takes effect, we returned to Israel the remains of Golani Brigade fighter Oron Shaul.

I embrace the dear members of the Shaul family and commend the IDF and ISA forces for their resourcefulness and their bravery.

The photographs of Oron Shaul and Hadar Goldin, of blessed memory, who fell during Operation Protective Edge in 2014, have been before me in my office for many years as daily testimony to my commitment to bring them back home.

We have completed the mission to bring back Oron and will not rest until we also complete the mission to bring back Hadar Goldin.

We will continue to act to return all of our hostages, the living and the deceased."
