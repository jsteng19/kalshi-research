Following are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahuâ€™s remarks at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting today:

"In recent days, I have read and heard quotes attributed to me that I did not say. I would like to make it clear: We want to achieve peace with the Palestinians and with the countries of the Arab world, while attempting to reach maximum understanding with the US and our friends around the world. My aspiration is to achieve a stable peace that rests on a solid foundation of security for the State of Israel and its citizens. Next week, I will make a major diplomatic speech in which I will present the citizens of Israel with our principles for achieving peace and security. Ahead of the speech, I intend to listen to the opinions of the coalition partners and other elements among the Israeli public."
