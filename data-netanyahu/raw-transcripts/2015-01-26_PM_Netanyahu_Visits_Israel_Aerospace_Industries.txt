Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon, Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) Chairman Rafi Maor and IAI President and CEO, Joseph Weiss today, to mark Israeli Space Week, toured Israel Aerospace Industries' Systems, Missiles and Space Group in Yehud, where the world's most advanced observation satellites are produced.

At the start of the tour PM Netanyahu made the following statement:

"We are here in the framework of Space Week, which takes place close to the date of the death of the late Ilan Ramon. Israel is a space power. We operate on sea, on land, in the air and also in space in order to ensure Israel's security. We are challenged from many directions, in many fields, but there is no doubt that the greatest challenge to our security is the attempt by Iran to arm itself with nuclear weapons. In this regard, the agreement now being formulated between the major powers and Iran is unacceptable to Israel. This agreement is dangerous to Israel, to the region and to the world. It leaves Iran the ability to produce the necessary material for a nuclear bomb within a few months and afterwards, to produce dozens of nuclear bombs. Therefore, Israel adamantly opposes this agreement. I, as Prime Minister, stand up and say this unequivocally. We will do everything in order to prevent the arming of Iran with nuclear weapons capabilities."
