Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this evening met with Argentinian Vice President Marta Gabriela Michetti. The former welcomed the excellent state of bilateral relations and thanked the latter for Argentina's vote at the UN.

"We had a great visit in Argentina. I think it’s a new relationship. It was my first visit to Latin America, to a country south of the United States, the first visit of an Israeli prime minister in 70 years. We’re very excited about this relationship. There are, I think, tremendous possibilities. And I was also very impressed by what President Macri is doing in Argentina, what he is trying to do to lift it up economically. I think it’s a wonderful relationship as a human bridge, Argentinian Jews who are here, but also I would say a partnership of worldview, the worldview."

"We decided to visit Israel together with the President of Argentina because we thought that there are several countries that are strategic for us. We have excellent ties, also with the Jewish community of Argentina. We are also trying to leverage the economic issues. We want to deepen these ties so that bilateral trade and investments will grow. We mainly need to realize this view, that everything is done via actions, trade, investments and the market."
