Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, made the following remarks about recent events in Syria:

"The reported use of chemical weapons against innocent civilians is terribly disturbing.

If verified, it will be a horrible addition to the roster of tragic crimes committed by the Syrian regime against the people of Syria.

It is absurd that the UN investigators, who are right now in Damascus to verify use of chemical weapons, are prevented from reaching the afflicted areas by the Syrian regime.

Syria has become Iran's testing ground, and Iran is closely watching whether and how the world responds to the atrocities committed by Iran's client state Syria and by Iran's proxy Hezbollah against innocent civilians in Syria.

These events prove yet again that we simply cannot allow the world's most dangerous regimes to acquire the world's most dangerous weapons."
