Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, last night, in his Jerusalem office, met with US Senators John McCain (R-AZ), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Kelly Ayotte (R-NH), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Christopher Coons (D-DE). They discussed the changes in the Middle East including the need to intensify sanctions against Iran, which is continuing to advance its nuclear program, and the advanced contacts between the Palestinian Authority and Hamas.

Prime Minister thanked the Republican and Democratic Senators for the Senate's unreserved, bipartisan support for the State of Israel and said: "Building in Jerusalem is not the world's problem; a nuclear Iran is the world's problem. History will not forgive those who do not stop Iran's nuclear program."
