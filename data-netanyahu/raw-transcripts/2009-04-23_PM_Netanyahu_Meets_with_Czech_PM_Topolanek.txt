Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today at his official Jerusalem residence, met with Czech Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek, who currently holds the rotating EU Presidency. The meeting included various issues regarding the strengthening of Israel-EU relations and the situation in the Middle East. "I am here as a representative of European countries that are concerned by regional developments and want to help, as we did in the past. I express the hope that this part of the world will live in peace and security," the Czech Prime Minister said at the start of the meeting.

Prime Minister Netanyahu stressed – inter alia – the relationship between the two countries and noted that the Czech Republic and Israel had much in common: "There was a very rich Jewish tradition in the Czech Republic and both peoples' had tragic experiences with a common enemy. Today, we are two civilized nations, two strong democracies that stand together with the civilized nations against another common enemy that threatens all of our values and threatens us directly, that threatens the State of Israel."

Prime Minister Netanyahu emphasized that Israel appreciates the decision of the Czech representatives at the Durban II conference to leave the hall during
