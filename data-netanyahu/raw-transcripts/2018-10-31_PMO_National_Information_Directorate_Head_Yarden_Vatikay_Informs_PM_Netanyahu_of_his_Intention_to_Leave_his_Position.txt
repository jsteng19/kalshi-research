Prime Minister's Office National Information Directorate Head Yarden Vatikay informed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of his intention to leave his position in the coming months.

Vatikay established the Directorate in March 2008, and has led it for eleven years. Vatikay has led and taken part in hundreds of national public diplomacy initiatives, in cooperation with public diplomacy bodies, government spokespersons, and security and emergency agencies, and has assisted the Prime Minister in advancing the public diplomacy efforts of the State of Israel.

"Establishing the directorate brought about a revolution, from the independent activities of each of the public diplomacy organizations to an advanced, well-oiled system that takes full advantage of the public diplomacy tools of the State of Israel. There is no better school for learning leadership, diplomacy and the use of public diplomacy to advocate policy than by working at the side of Prime Minister Netanyahu."

"I thank Yarden Vatikay for his dedication and professionalism in the service of Israel's public diplomacy efforts. He was of great assistance throughout his years of duty, including on challenging security events. I wish him continued success."
