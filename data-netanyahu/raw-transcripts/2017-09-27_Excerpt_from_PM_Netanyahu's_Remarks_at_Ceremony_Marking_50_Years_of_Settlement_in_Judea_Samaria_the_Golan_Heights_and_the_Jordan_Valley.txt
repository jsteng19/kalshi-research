Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife attended a ceremony marking 50 years of settlement in Judea, Samaria, the Golan Heights and the Jordan Valley. Following is an excerpt from the Prime Minister's remarks:

"We have brought about magnificent settlement in Judea and Samaria that we are maintaining and strengthening â€“ responsibly, wisely and persistently. Settlement is important to you my friends. It is no less important to me and therefore, I tell you clearly and before anything: There will be no more uprooting of communities in the Land of Israel!

It is not just a question of links to the homeland, though it is certainly that, but first of all, that is not the way to make peace. We will uproot neither Jews nor Arabs. We did not receive peace; we received terror and missiles! We will not go back to this. That was just the promo, that uprooting, to what is currently going on in the Middle East: Any area that falls to radical Islam becomes a base for destruction, violence and death. Therefore, we will not abandon our national home to danger. Instead we will strengthen the home, with momentum. When I say momentum I mean not just words but also momentum, movement."
