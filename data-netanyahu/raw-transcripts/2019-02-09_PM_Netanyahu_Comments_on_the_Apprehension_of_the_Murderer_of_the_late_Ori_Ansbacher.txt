"I commend the ISA and Israel Police special anti-terror unit for apprehending – within a few hours – the abhorrent murderer of the late Ori Ansbacher. The long arm of Israel will reach whoever hurts us and we will settle accounts with them.

For myself and for the entire people of Israel I would like to express condolences to the Ansbacher family and to support them during their terrible grief."
