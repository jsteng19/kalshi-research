Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu:

"Abu Mazen gave another anti-Semitic speech.

With utmost ignorance and brazen gall, he claimed that European Jews were persecuted and murdered not because they were Jews but because they gave loans with interest.

Abu Mazen again recited the most contemptible anti-Semitic canards.

Apparently the Holocaust-denier is still a Holocaust-denier.

I call on the international community to condemn Abu Mazen's severe anti-Semitism; the time has come for it to pass from the world."
