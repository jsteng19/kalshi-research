Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, expressed his deep sorrow over the passing of [former Tel Aviv Mayor] Shlomo Lahat. "Shlomo served the State of Israel both in the IDF and in public service. He played a major role in Tel Aviv's becoming what it is today â€“ a vibrant, cultured symbol of tolerance. If you said 'Shlomo Lahat', you said 'Tel Aviv.' May his memory be blessed," the Prime Minister said.
