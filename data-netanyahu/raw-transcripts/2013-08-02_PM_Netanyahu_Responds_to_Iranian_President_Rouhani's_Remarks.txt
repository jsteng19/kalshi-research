Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani remarks in which he was cited as saying that Israel 'has been a wound on the body of the Islamic world for years and should be removed':

"Rouhani's true face has been revealed earlier than expected. Even if they will now rush to deny his remarks, this is what the man thinks and this is the plan of the Iranian regime. These remarks by President Rouhani must rouse the world from the illusion that part of it has been caught up in since the Iranian elections. The President there has changed but the goal of the regime has not: To achieve nuclear weapons in order to threaten Israel, the Middle East and the peace and security of the entire world. A country that threatens the destruction of the State of Israel must not be allowed to possess weapons of mass destruction," the Prime Minister said.
