Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, at the start of the Cabinet meeting, made the following remarks:

"Pursuant to the efforts that I led in establishing the peace agreement with Bahrain, today an Israel delegation led by National Security Council head Meir Ben-Shabbat left for Bahrain. It left together with an American delegation led by Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin.

This is impressive progress and, of course, we are advancing these peace agreements with them and with the UAE, genuine peace.

The delegations will now work on cooperation agreements and establishing a peace agreement with Bahrain. This is an additional breakthrough in our relations with the Arab world thanks to the new and different policy that we are leading. It is not so new because we have been leading it for 25 years but it is bearing fruit today â€“ peace for peace, economics for economics.

This is a very moving day. I hope that we will be able to tell you soon about additional countries."
