Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, commented as follows on the desecration of graves in France:

"Today something shocking happened in France. Eighty Jewish graves were desecrated with Nazi symbols by wild anti-Semites.

I call on the leaders of France and Europe to take a strong stand against anti-Semitism. It is a plague that endangers everyone, not just us, and it must be condemned wherever and whenever it rears its head."
