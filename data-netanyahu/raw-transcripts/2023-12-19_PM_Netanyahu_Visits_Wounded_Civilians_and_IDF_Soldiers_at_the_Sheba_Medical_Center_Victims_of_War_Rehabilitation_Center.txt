Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, visited the Sheba Medical Center Victims of War Rehabilitation Center, where he met with civilians who were wounded on October 7th and IDF soldiers who were wounded in the fighting in the Gaza Strip.

The wounded soldiers told the Prime Minister about the fierce battles they waged against Hamas terrorists. The Prime Minister was updated on their medical status, recovery process and the rehabilitation that they are now undergoing.

Prime Minister Netanyahu at the conclusion of the visit:

"Thank you to the medical team, which has performed miracles. There is a combination here of miracles and utmost heroism the likes of which I do not think have been seen anywhere. These are genuine heroes who are coming back to life.

The lives of our soldiers is our highest concern. These are the orders that we give â€“ to safeguard their lives and do everything so that they will be able to fight and stay safe. This is what we have done and this is what we will continue to do. There is nothing more precious. You are genuine heroes."

Sheba Medical Center Associate Director General Prof. Arnon Afek:

"Most of those wounded in the war are currently being cared for in the departments and at the Victims of War Rehabilitation Center that was established at the start of the war. We will continue to receive them and provide them with the best medical care until we return them to life."
