Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu commends the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee for unanimously approving his proposal to also deduct from Palestinian Authority funds the compensation payments for damages caused by the fires in the area adjacent to the Gaza Strip.

It should be noted that last week the Prime Minister instructed the Director of the National Security Council to advance the proposal and include in it the compensation for fire damages.

Prime Minister Netanyahu: "Justice needs to be done here. Whoever burns fields should know that there will be a price."
