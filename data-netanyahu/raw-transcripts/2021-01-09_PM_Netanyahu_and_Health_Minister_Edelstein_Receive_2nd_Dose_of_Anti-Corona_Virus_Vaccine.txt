Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Health Minister Yuli Edelstein, this evening, at Sheba Medical Center at Tel Hashomer, received the second dose of the anti-corona virus vaccine. Prime Minister Netanyahu: "I am used to it but I am excited and I am certain that all citizens of Israel who are about to receive the second dose of the vaccine are excited like me. In my 17th conversation with my friend, Pfizer Chairman and CEO Albert Bourla, we agreed about additional huge shipments of vaccines for the State of Israel, which will enable us to vaccinate all citizens of Israel over 16 within two months, by the end of March at the latest. The first huge shipment is due to arrive tomorrow and through Operation Getting Back to Life, we will be able to open our economy quickly, the pubs, restaurants, gyms, schools, synagogues and theaters. We will do so via the green passport; we will go into detail about this later. For this to happen, I need two things from you, citizens of Israel: Be vaccinated and obey the lockdown against mutations. We are doing this together. We entered the coronavirus together and we will emerge from it first in the world and stronger than ever."
