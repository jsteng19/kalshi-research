The government approved the Digital Israel project last month in order to find innovative ways to provide digital services to the public via the use of advanced technologies that allow for the rapid transfer of high-volume content over a fiber-optic (or other) infrastructure.

The initiative will facilitate public links with, and accessibility to, the education, health and social welfare systems in the State of Israel while reducing geographic and social gaps, thus drawing the periphery closer to the center. In the future, the initiative will be expanded to other relevant government ministries.

The initiative will also promote the infusion of technological tools in both the business and public sectors, including in small businesses by (inter alia) encouraging online commerce and sharing information, reducing bureaucracy and using online means to improve public service efficiency without having to leave one's home. The initiative is being led by the Prime Minister's Office, including Director General Harel Locker and Deputy Director General Yossi Catribas.
