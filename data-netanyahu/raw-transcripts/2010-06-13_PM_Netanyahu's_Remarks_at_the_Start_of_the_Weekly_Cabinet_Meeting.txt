Following are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting today:

"Before

the flotilla

set sail for Gaza, we discussed – in various forums – the continuation of our policy toward the Gaza Strip. These discussions continued last week, inter alia, in the meetings I held on the subject with Quartet envoy Tony Blair.

The principle guiding our policy is clear – to prevent the entry of war materiel from entering Gaza and

to allow the entry of humanitarian aid and non-contraband goods into the Gaza Strip

The aforesaid discussions, which will continue this week, are designed to ensure that this principle is effectively applied."
