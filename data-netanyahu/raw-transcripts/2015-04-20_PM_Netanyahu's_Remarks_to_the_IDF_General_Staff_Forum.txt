Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with the IDF General Staff forum and made the following remarks at the start of the meeting:

"The meaning of independence in my view is, first of all, the ability to defend yourself.

To the growing threats around us we have a response, which is found in this room. I rely on you, Chief-of-Staff, and I rely on the IDF. The people of Israel rely on you."
