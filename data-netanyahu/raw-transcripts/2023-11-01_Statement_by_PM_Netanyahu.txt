Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today:

"We are in a difficult war. This will be a long war. We have so many important achievements but also painful losses.

We know that every soldier of ours is an entire world. The entire people of Israel embrace you, the families, from the depth of our heart. We are all with you during your heavy sorrow.

Our soldiers have fallen in the most just of wars, the war for our home.

I promise the citizens of Israel: We will complete the work â€“ we will continue until victory."
