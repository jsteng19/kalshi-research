Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today at an event at the Menachem Begin Heritage Center in Jerusalem, made the following remarks:

"When it comes to Israel's security â€“ there are no compromises, and against the danger of radical Islam we are honing our defensive and offensive capabilities and thereby ensuring our existence. We are also prepared to summon the world against an existential danger to us, which is not an existential danger only to us.

We will not allow Iran to acquire nuclear weapons; this agreement does not bind us. Whoever attacks us or tries to attack us, we will retaliate. There will be no 'trickle', no agreement and no restraint. Whoever threatens our existence will find their existence in danger."
