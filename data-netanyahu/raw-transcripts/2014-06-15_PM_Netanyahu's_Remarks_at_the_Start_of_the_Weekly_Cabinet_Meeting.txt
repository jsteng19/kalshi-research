Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made the following remarks at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting:

"This morning I can say what I was unable to say yesterday before the extensive wave of arrests of Hamas members in Judea and Samaria.

Those who perpetrated the abduction of our youths were members of Hamas â€“ the same Hamas that Abu Mazen made a unity government with; this has severe repercussions.

We are currently focusing all of our efforts on bringing the abductees back home. Before coming here, I spoke again with the families, and I embrace and encourage them from here, from the Cabinet table, and I know that I speak for all parts of the nation."
