Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara will tonight leave for the US to attend the Jewish Federations of North America General Assembly in New Orleans.

Prime Minister Netanyahu will address the General Assembly on Monday. During his visit to the US, he is also expected to hold diplomatic meetings with US Vice President Joe Biden (Sunday, in New Orleans), UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon (Monday, in New York), US Secretary of State Hilary Clinton (Thursday, in New York) and US Ambassador to the UN Susan Rice (Wednesday, in New York). The Prime Minister is also scheduled to meet in New York with leading media figures and senior Wall Street economists, and grant media interviews, in order to explain Israel's positions.

Before boarding his plane, Prime Minister Netanyahu said, "I am looking forward to important meetings with US Vice President Biden and US Secy. of State Clinton, who share in the great efforts that we are making in order to continue the peace process. I will also speak about this, and other issues, with UN Secy.-Gen. Ki-moon, US UN Amb. Rice and others. I hope that on this visit, we and the US administration will find the way to advance the diplomatic process while maintaining Israel's national and security interests."
