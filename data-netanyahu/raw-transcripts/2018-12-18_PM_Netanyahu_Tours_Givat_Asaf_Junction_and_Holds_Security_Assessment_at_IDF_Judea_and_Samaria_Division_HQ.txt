Prime Minister and Defense Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this morning (Tuesday, 18 December 2018), at IDF Judea and Samaria Division headquarters in the Binyamin Regional Council area, held a security assessment with IDF Chief-of-Staff Lt.-Gen. Gadi Eisenkot, GOC Central Command Maj.-Gen. Nadav Padan, IDF Judea and Samaria Division commander Brig.-Gen. Eran Niv and other senior commanders.

Prime Minister Netanyahu received security briefings on ongoing IDF counter-terrorism and community defense operations in Judea and Samaria and spoke with area brigade and battalion commanders.

Prime Minster Netanyahu, at Givat Asaf junction, the site of the 9 December terrorist attack, said:

"Over the weekend there were 100 arrests and yesterday there were 36. It is only a matter of time until we also find this murderer, as we found the others, and we will settle accounts with him as we did with the others. Palestinian terrorism will not uproot us from here. This place is the heart of our homeland.

We will strengthen settlement even more, just as we have done now. And we will take all steps against terrorism, including additional steps. We will not tolerate terrorism from Gaza or from Judea and Samaria. We will hit it hard.

I would like to commend here the settler public for showing resilience and steadfastness in the face of this murderous terrorism, and praise the IDF commanders and soldiers who are guarding every citizen, around the clock, seven days a week."
