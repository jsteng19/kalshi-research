Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, on the eve of Remembrance Day for the Fallen of Israel's Wars, met with Ben Reuven (David Herman), who had asked to give him a disc with his song "The Yonatan Victory March", which he wrote in 1976 is in memory of the Prime Minister's brother, Lt.-Col. Yonatan Netanyahu, and sing it.

Reuven told Prime Minister Netanyahu, "Like I wrote on the back of the disc, I am among the millions of people around the world who were deeply impressed by the daring and heroism of the Entebbe operation. I wrote the song and set it to music almost 40 years ago out of the urge to express my admiration for the great achievement of the Entebbe operation and the late Yoni Netanyahu. The result was this song, which revives – in words and music – the unique drama of the operation."

THE YONATAN VICTORY MARCHThere in the fear and fire of Entebbe,Hostages pray and the hours drag by,There in the fear and the fire of Entebbe,Hostages pray and prepare to die… We won't let you die, my brothers,We won't bow to tyranny,G-d is great, His arm is strong, my brothers,We'll find the way to cruel EntebbeAnd set you free, set you free,And set you free.

Back from the night they've come,Commandos of Yonatan,Bravely they fought and won,The boys of Yonatan,The boys of Yonatan,Yonatan.
