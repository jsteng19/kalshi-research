Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today , on the burning of the flags and wreaths that were laid in memory of IDF fallen:

"Desecrating the honor of the fallen, thanks to whom we are all living here, is a shocking act. I strongly condemn this barbarism and I expect the authorities to deal with those responsible to the fullest extent of the law as quickly as possible."
