Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued the following statement on the passing of former Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew:

"Lee Kuan Yew, the founding father of Singapore, was not only a great leader of his nation, but also a figure of great international renown. Under his leadership, Singapore set an example of how a small country can become an economic powerhouse by harnessing the ingenuity and entrepreneurial spirit of its people. He will be remembered in Israel and around the world with great admiration and respect."
