Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today approved the transfer, at this stage, of the tax funds to the Palestinian Authority. The decision was made following a meeting of the forum of eight ministers, in the wake of the halt in unilateral steps by the Palestinian Authority. In the event that the Palestinian Authority returns to unilateral measures, the transfer of the funds will be re-evaluated.
