Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, spoke by telephone with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The Prime Minister expressed his confidence in the credibility of the IDF investigation and its conclusions, and reiterated that the Syrian military, which brought down the plane, and Iran, whose aggression is undermining stability, are responsible for the unfortunate incident.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said that transferring advanced weapons systems into irresponsible hands will increase the dangers in the region, and added that Israel will continue to defend its security and its interests.

It was agreed to continue the dialogue between the professional teams and the inter-military coordination via the military channels.

Prime Minister Netanyahu again expressed his condolences over the death of Russian soldiers.
