Dear Mr. President,

On behalf of the Government and people of Israel, I offer our heartfelt condolences to you and to the people of the United States on the massive tornado that struck in Oklahoma and exacted such a horrific toll in human life.

Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims of this tragedy and their families at this difficult time.

In friendship,Benjamin Netanyahu
