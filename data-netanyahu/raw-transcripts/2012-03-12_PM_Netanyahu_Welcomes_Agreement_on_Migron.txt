Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today made the following remarks about the agreement that was reached regarding Migron:

“I would like to welcome the agreement that was reached with the residents of Migron and thank all those who were involved, especially Minister Benny Begin. He worked day and night, with boundless dedication, in the face of many obstacles but he succeeded in overcoming them and in leading a complex effort. Thank you Benny! You are an example of responsible and determined leadership. I would also like to thank our friend Danny Dayan, Zeev Haver, the people at the Interior Ministry and, no less perhaps, the residents of Migron. I understand the emotional difficulties but I think that, in the end, they acted responsibly. We respect the law and the courts and ask that the court adopt this agreement, which was achieved with great effort.”
