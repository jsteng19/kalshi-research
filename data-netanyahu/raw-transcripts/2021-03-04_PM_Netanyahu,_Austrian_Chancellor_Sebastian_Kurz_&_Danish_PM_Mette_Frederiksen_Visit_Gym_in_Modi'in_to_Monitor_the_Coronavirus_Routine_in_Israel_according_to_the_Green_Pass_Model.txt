Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz and Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, today, visited a gym in Modi'in to monitor the coronavirus routine in Israel according to the green pass model.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"Many of the people here are already double vaccinated. We're getting to a position where we've finished vaccinating the adult population over 50, which is where almost 100% of the serious illnesses and deaths. First, to clear the hospitals, the older people must be vaccinated.

In about four-five weeks, we'll finish vaccinating all the 50+. Within eight weeks, we'll finish all the people in Israel above 16 years old, except those people who won't vaccinate for any price.

The path that we're leading now, and this is what you're seeing here in this gym, is the green passport, which means that you don't wait until everybody is vaccinated. You can start opening basically everything in the economy and the state with the green passport as you move along. This is what you're seeing in Israel.

I think we'll have to wear masks for a while. We don't know about the mutations. There are all sorts of variants. I think we should, it's better to be careful. People will wear masks more readily if they feel that they're coming back to life. It's a small price to pay."
