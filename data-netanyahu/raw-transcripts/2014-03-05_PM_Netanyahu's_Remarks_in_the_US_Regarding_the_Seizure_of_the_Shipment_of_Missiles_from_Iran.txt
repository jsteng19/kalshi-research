Following are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks from earlier today regarding the seizure of the shipment of missiles from Iran :

"I congratulate the Defense Minister, the Chief-of-Staff, GOC Intelligence, the Director of the Mossad, GOC Navy and the soldiers. I congratulate them on a perfect action at sea, which was based on precise intelligence. Our goal here was, first of all, to foil the delivery of deadly weapons from Iran to the terrorist organizations in Gaza, weapons which would have endangered the security of Israeli citizens.

The second goal is to expose the true face of Iran. Iran is currently holding talks with the major powers, and is smiling, even as it grossly violates international law and arms terrorist organizations with equilibrium-changing weapons. This is what we are exposing to the world and have just done so in a very methodical way. We will release additional details later.

I think that a very important principle has found expression here, one that I have reiterated time and again, including in my talks in the US with President Obama and in my public appearances : Israel has the obligation and the right to defend itself by itself against any threat and, I add, anywhere. This is what we have done and this is what we will continue to do. And the second lesson is that such a state, a terrorist state par excellence, which sends deadly weapons to Syria, Hezbollah and Hamas, as well as to other terrorist organizations, such a state cannot be allowed to produce nuclear weapons."
