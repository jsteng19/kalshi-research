Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's opening remarks: "I have come to here you because we are in the midst of a tremendous upheaval. What we can say in certainty is that many Israelis find it difficult to finish the month and the gaps in Israel's society are widening. We want to deal with these two problems â€“ to ease the cost of living and to bridge the gaps. In order to do this we need to bring about changes, real changes. am very impressed with Professor Trajtenberg's committee. They are opening round tables and they are conducting thorough and serious work. What has to be done here is serious work, thorough and serious. Thorough because the problems are not simple, serious because there is responsibility here, and responsibility dictates that we must deal with the social issues with social sensitivity and economic responsibility. That means that we cannot go wild, cannot breach all frameworks, cannot expend money as if there is no tomorrow. Problems must be dealt with, priorities altered, and with that to safeguard our economy. We have an economy that is holding up well relative to the world upheaval, and we know that if we safeguard the economy it will safeguard the country and will also help us to deal with real social distress. That is our intention. It is clear to me that some of the things, it would seem a large proportion of them, will ultimately come to this committee, and therefore it is important for me, during this process, to hear from you, because we will certainly meet later on. That, in fact, is the aim of this meeting, to hear you, and that is what I now intend to do."
