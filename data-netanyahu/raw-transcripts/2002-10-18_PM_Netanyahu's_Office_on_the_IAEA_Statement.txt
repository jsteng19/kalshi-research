Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office:

"The IAEA relates to inspections that it has carried out in various places in Iran but it does not relate to the specific site in Turquzabad which Prime Minister Netanyahu referred to in his UN speech. There is no reason to wait. The IAEA must inspect the site and immediately dispatch monitors with Geiger counters and the Prime Minister's words will be seen as verifiably true."
