"Our national path, which has allowed us to rise up from the ashes and gather in the exiles of thousands of years, is a shared fate, mutual guarantees and unity between all parts of the nation. The heroism of our people is made of countless links and the memory of the fallen is built layer upon layer.

Jews, and alongside them our non-Jewish brothers, who are bound together, all fought shoulder-to-shoulder and gave their lives so that Israel might have security and peace.

IDF soldiers and the personnel of the security services are the defenders and heroes of the nation. Thanks to the sacrifice of the fallen, we have been able to build a prosperous and flourishing state, among the most advanced in the world, whose greatest days are yet to come. It is only natural that this hall of remembrance, the cornerstone of which we are laying today, will express what unites us and binds us together, which is the secret of the revival of Israel."
