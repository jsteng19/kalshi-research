Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today meet with French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and expressed his appreciation for French President Nicolas Sarkozy's and the French Government's decision to act against Libya.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said that he believes that France's actions have sent a sharp and determined message and helped prevent mass slaughter. "Gadhafi has a long history of international terrorism and violence against his people. He has never been a friend of Israel or of the Jewish People and Israel will certainly not regret seeing him disappear from the map," the Prime Minister said. He added that the State of Israel hopes that when a new government will arise in Libya, it will advance peace and security for all peoples of the entire region.

Prime Minister Netanyahu also commended the manner in which the Greek Government has dealt with its economic crisis. He expressed his confidence the Greek people would succeed in recovering from the current crisis and that the Greek economy would return to prosperity. The Prime Minister called on the EU to assist Greece in this important process.

Prime Minister Netanyahu also called on France to continue working for the release of soldier Gilad Shalit. In a return letter that French President Sarkozy's wife, Carla Bruni, sent to Sara Netanyahu, the former wrote that France is doing its utmost to bring Gilad's suffering to an end, in close cooperation with Israel. "Like you, I also wish with all my heart that this affair will soon be brought to a close," she wrote.
