Following are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks at the start of his meeting with Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin today in Moscow:

"First, I would like to thank you and the Russian Government for very quickly sending us planes and brave pilots and helping us to extinguish the Carmel wildfire. This was an outstanding sign of friendship and determined action and I would simply like to thank you personally on behalf of the Israeli people. So first of all, thank you.

Secondly, I would like to express my appreciation for your sharp condemnation of terrorism, of the terrorist assaults that we have absorbed. Recently, there have been several of these. I need not tell the leaders of Russia and the Russian people about terrorism. We are vigorously fighting terrorism. This needs to be a common goal of all civilized nations. You rightly said that terrorism is a tool for extremist and radical regimes and movements that are trying to impose fear on all civilized people."
