Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, met with the archaeological team responsible for the discovery – at Khirbet Qeiyafa in the Elah Valley – of a rare inscription, on a clay jar, from the time of King David. The archaeologists told the Prime Minister about the jar and noted that up until five years ago there were no known inscriptions from the Kingdom of Judah in the 10th century BCE. The team pointed out that four have been discovered in recent years – two from Khirbet Qeiyafa, one from Jerusalem and one from Beit Shemesh, thus attesting that writing was more widespread than previously thought. Among those attending today's meeting were Prof. Yosef Garfinkel of the Hebrew University Institute of Archaeology, Saar Ganor from the Israel Antiquities Authority, and other IAA personnel who were involved in the excavations. Prime Minister Netanyahu said, "This is an amazing find and a very important discovery. It attests to what happened here, in this country, in the time of King David."
