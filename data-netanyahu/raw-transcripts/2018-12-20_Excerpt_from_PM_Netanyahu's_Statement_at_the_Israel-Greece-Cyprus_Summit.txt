PM Netanyahu, at the Israel-Greece-Cyprus summit in Be'er Sheva, made the following statement to the media:

[Translated from the Hebrew]

"We are continuing our efforts to neutralize the terror tunnels. At this time we are using special means to bring about the neutralization of these tunnels.

We will continue to take very strong action against Iran's attempts to entrench itself in Syria. In neither of these sectors do we intend to lessen our efforts; we will intensify them, and I know that we do so with the full support and backing of the US."
