Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sent a condolence letter to the family of Rahat resident Salah Abu-Latyef, a Defense Ministry contract employee, who was shot and killed while working near Kibbutz Nahal Oz perimeter fence.

Prime Minister wrote:

"Dear members of the Abu-Latif family,

I was deeply outraged upon hearing of Salah's tragic death. From what I have heard about him, I learned about a modest young man, beloved by his family and friends, who sought an honorable living. Salah worked for a company on contract to the Ministry of Defense. His work in the south focused on infrastructure work to protect human lives and prevent death and destruction. Dear members of the Latif family, I support you in this difficult hour. May you no longer know such sorrow. Please convey my sincere condolences to the entire family.

Yours in grief,

Benjamin Netanyahu."
