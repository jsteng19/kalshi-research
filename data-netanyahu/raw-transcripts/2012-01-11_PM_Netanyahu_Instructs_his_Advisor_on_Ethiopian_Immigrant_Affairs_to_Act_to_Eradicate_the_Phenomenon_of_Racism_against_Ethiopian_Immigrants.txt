Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today instructed his advisor on Ethiopian immigrant affairs, Alali Adamsu, to act to eradicate the phenomenon of racism against Ethiopian immigrants.

Adamsu, who met last night in Kiryat Malakhi with the organizers of yesterday's protest, updated the Prime Minister on the implementation of the five-year plan, which the Cabinet approved in 2010, on improving the immigrants' absorption.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said that, "We are full of admiration for Ethiopian immigrants. In the face of obstacles and difficulties, they came here and are integrating into Israeli society, which we are encouraging in every possible way. Racist phenomena are infuriating and have no place in Israeli society. The ingathering of exiles from Ethiopia and everywhere else in the world is an inseparable part of the character of the State of Israel."
