Following are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks (today) during his tour of an

Iron Dome battery

in Ashkelon:

"This technological achievement is very impressive and it must be remembered that it is the result of the work of very many people. First of all, there are all those who planned and operated the system, the air defense soldiers.

I congratulate everyone. Israel has scored a breakthrough. I was in a meeting with Czech Prime Minister Petr Necas when my military secretary entered and, with emotion, reported about the first interception. Since then there have been others. However, we must remember that we cannot, even with all the improvements, and there will be major improvements in these systems, protect every home. We cannot protect every installation. We cannot protect every site in the State of Israel. We can do much more but in the end, our best defense is a combination of defensive capability and a deterrent offensive capability.

The IDF has been active in the Gaza

Strip just now and it struck very hard after Hamas's criminal aggression against us. No other country would be willing to countenance

the intentional firing of an anti-tank missile at a children's bus

, to say nothing of criminal attacks against civilians, and Israel is certainly not willing to accept it. Today, the Cabinet instructed the IDF to do whatever is necessary to stop the firing at our people and restore quiet to the south. This is our intention. I hope that this will be Hamas's intention as well. If this is what it intends, then quiet will return. If it steps up its aggression, it will feel our arm and our response will be much harsher."
