Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expresses deep sorrow over last night's murder of three family members in the community of Halamish. This was an act of terrorism committed by a beast incited by wild hatred.

The security forces are doing their utmost to maintain security and, to this end, will take all necessary measures.
