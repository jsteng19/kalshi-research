Prime Minister Netanyahu, at Rambam Hospital in Haifa, visited people who were injured in the Mt. Meron disaster. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: "I have just finished visiting patients who were injured in the Mt. Meron disaster. I was impressed by the marvelous care that they are receiving from the medical staff here just as I was impressed by the rescue operation, which undoubtedly saved lives including those of several patients here. We are praying for their well-being. One of the parents told me the sentence that summarizes everything: 'Here one reveals that the people of Israel has one heart.' Our heart is with the injured and all of us hope and pray for their full recovery."
