Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, visited the headquarters of the State of Israel's security organizations on the occasion of Rosh Hashanah.

At Mossad headquarters, Prime Minister Netanyahu praised the organization's achievements and said, "Your secret activity is an important component in the security of Israel's citizens. It is part of our vigorous security policy which has – in recent years – restored to the State of Israel its deterrence. We have very great tasks before us especially in light of what is occurring on our borders. In one of the most challenging periods for Israel's security, we are steering the country with responsibility, considerable experience and sagacity."

At Israel Security Agency headquarters, Prime Minister Netanyahu expressed the Government's high esteem for ISA employees and directors who work day and night to foil terrorism in the Gaza Strip, Sinai and Judea and Samaria. He added that these achievements have contributed to significantly reducing the number of terrorism casualties in recent years. He noted the timely thwarting of Hamas cell from the Ramallah area and Jerusalem which was in advanced planning stages to perpetrate a major attack in Jerusalem over the holidays. "Nobody can assure us that this quiet will be maintained," the Prime Minister said, "but the ISA and the security forces are ready to continue defending the citizens of Israel against any threat."

At the Israel National Cyber Bureau, Prime Minister Netanyahu said, "Israel is a global cyber force and you are leading Israel to the vanguard in a significant field that affects all aspects of our lives."

Last Friday, Prime Minister Netanyahu met with the IDF General Staff forum, with the participation of Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon, IDF Chief-of-Staff Lt.-Gen. Benny Gantz and General Staff officers.
