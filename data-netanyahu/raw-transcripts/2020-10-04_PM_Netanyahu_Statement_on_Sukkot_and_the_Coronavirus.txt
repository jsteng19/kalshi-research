Prime Minister Netanyahu: "Citizens of Israel, happy holiday. Like you, I celebrated Sukkot a little differently; this is a Sukkot without guests. I know, it is different but I ask from everyone – ultra-orthodox and secular alike – to maintain the directives. The lockdown directives are not against you. They are against the virus and if we all work together, we will defeat this virus. Today I held talks on the issue of rapid tests, also on the economy, and on other subjects as well, around the clock. We are working in order to defeat the virus. Now, there are those who are already saying that they are cautiously optimistic that the lockdown is already beginning to work, to flatten the growth curve. I am more cautious than the cautious. I want to wait until at least ten days have passed. This means that the decisions on the continuation of the lockdown, after Simchat Torah, we will only make on Thursday. In the meantime, tomorrow in the Cabinet we will discuss long-term coronavirus exit data, the transition from stage to stage, safeguarding the older population, bigger fines and increased discipline and enforcement, because this is in our soul. I ask that you all unite like the four species for the good of our people and for the good of all citizens of the State of Israel in the face of the global coronavirus pandemic – we will win."
