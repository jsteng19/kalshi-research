Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening, spoke with Rabbi Yaakov Kanievsky, the grandson of Rabbi Chaim Kanievsky. Prime Minister Netanyahu inquired after the well-being of Rabbi Chaim Kanievsky, who is recovering from the coronavirus, and said, "The entire nation prayed, and is still praying, for the well-being of the Rabbi as an admired leader and a figure devoted entirely to Torah." Rabbi Yaakov Kanievsky updated the Prime Minister that his grandfather's position is that, "Torah and its study are a supreme value and safeguard the entire people, but on the condition that is studied while very strictly adhering to the rules of caution; the directives must be strictly adhered to without any easing of the rules of safeguarding and caution." Prime Minister Netanyahu expressed his appreciation for the ultra-orthodox local councils that have become green cities and stressed that, "In a comprehensive partnership, with responsibility and dialogue, we will maintain what has been achieved with hard work and we will lead Israel to being a green and safe country."
