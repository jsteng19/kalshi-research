Prime Minister Netanyahu then met with northern local council heads. Following is an excerpt from his remarks:

"We are in the middle of an operation to neutralize the tunnels threat. This is part of the main effort that we are making to neutralize the Hezbollah threat to the State of Israel. We are neutralizing Hezbollah's precision weaponry with impressive success. We are fighting against imprecise weaponry and now is the third effort â€“ neutralizing the tunnels threat.

The tunnels threat, if it could have been realized, would strike at you, at your residents and at our soldiers here. Hezbollah would have no problem emerging from the ground, abducting people and taking them into a tunnel, or alternatively, going on killing and abduction sprees inside your communities. With the current operation we are denying them this.

The IDF is doing exceptional work here. I must also praise the planning and the secrecy, also in the Security Cabinet. These achievements are contributing to neutralizing the enemy's weapons. I gain the impression here that there is great readiness on the part of our commanders and fighters to meet any scenario. If there is escalation, it will be very strong and harsh from Hezbollah's perspective. I want to commend your resilience, steadfastness and backing. These will last us for many years."
