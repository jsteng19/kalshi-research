Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, expressed his sorrow over the passing of former Mossad Director Yitzchak Hofi: "Throughout his life Yitzhak Hofi was active on behalf of the security of the State of Israel. He served in the Palmach, the Givati and Paratroop brigades, was GOC Northern Command during the Yom Kippur War and served as Director of the Mossad, including during Operation Yonatan to rescue the hostages at Entebbe. At this difficult time I would like to offer my condolences to his family. The people of Israel are grateful for his contribution to the security of the state."
