Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara, this evening , visited the Western Wall together with Western Wall Rabbi Shmuel Rabinowitz and Western Wall Heritage Foundation Director Mordechai Eliav. Prime Minister Netanyahu: "I just wrote in the book: 'The Guardian of Israel neither slumbers nor sleeps.' I have summarized the two continuing actions that I have taken upon myself both yesterday and today. We will continue to do this on behalf of the citizens of Israel, the State of Israel and the Land of Israel. I must say that I am also moved this time as well, to accept the position and lead the State of Israel. I have come here, the quarry from which we were shaped, to touch the stones of the Western Wall, and to remember that we are charged with the obligation of safeguarding the heritage of generations and ensuring our future for the coming generations as well, and this we will do."
