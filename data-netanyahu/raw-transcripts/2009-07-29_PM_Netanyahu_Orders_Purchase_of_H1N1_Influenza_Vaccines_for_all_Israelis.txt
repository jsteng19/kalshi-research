Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Deputy Health Minister Yaakov Litzman and senior Health Ministry professionals today discussed the spread of H1N1 influenza and preparations in its regard ahead of the coming winter.

Prime Minister Netanyahu decided to order vaccines for all Israeli citizens. He and Deputy Health Minister Litzman agreed to increase the State's supply of anti-influenza medicines by an additional 5% even though the State currently has more medicines in stock than the European average. The Prime Minister said: "This decision places Israel in line with the leading countries of the world on the issue of future supplies of influenza vaccines. On this context, it is important to emphasize that H1N1 vaccines are still undergoing development and are not yet 'on the shelf'. The vaccines will be delivered to various countries, including Israel, only after the conclusion of development, in a few months."

Purchasing the vaccines and the additional medicines will cost an estimated NIS 450 million. Prime Minister Netanyahu instructed Prime Minister's Office Director-General Eyal Gabai to coordinate with Finance Minister Yuval Steinitz and Deputy Health Minister Litzman on finding sources of financing and to submit a proposal to an upcoming Cabinet meeting.
