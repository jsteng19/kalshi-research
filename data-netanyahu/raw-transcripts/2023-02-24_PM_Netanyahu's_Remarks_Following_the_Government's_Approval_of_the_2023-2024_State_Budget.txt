Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this afternoon, following the Government's approval of the 2023-2024 state budget:

"I would like to thank the ministers and everyone who helped in the effort, the legal teams and the ministerial teams, but above and beyond, the Finance Minister. I had that job; it is not an easy job. You stood up in order to prevent a breach, and this is important.

We want to show that the tradition we have created here in the State of Israel, of a free economy with fiscal and monetary responsibility, and coordination between them, and independence for the Bank [of Israel], are valid for us always, especially at this time. I think that this budget does this and it also does it against the backdrop of the best macroeconomic data that I can remember in all my years on the job.

The Israeli economy is strong and steadfast. With the across-the-board support of the ministers today, it is even stronger.

Thank you everyone and Shabbat Shalom."
