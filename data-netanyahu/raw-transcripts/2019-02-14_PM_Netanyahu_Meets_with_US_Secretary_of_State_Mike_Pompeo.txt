Prime Minister Netanyahu, at the Warsaw conference on peace and security in the Middle East, met with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

"I want to thank Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Vice President Mike Pence and the Trump administration for putting together an extraordinary conference. Yesterday was a historical turning point. In a room of some sixty foreign ministers and representatives of dozens of governments, an Israeli prime minister and the foreign ministers of leading Arab countries stood together and spoke with unusual force, clarity and unity against the common threat of the Iranian regime.

This marks a change, an important understanding of what threatens our future, what we have to do to secure it and the possibilities of cooperation that extend beyond security to every realm of life for the peoples of the Middle East.

This happened here in Warsaw and the main conclusion that I have is that it must continue in other forms, in other ways for the same purpose. I want to thank you Secretary Pompeo for doing this â€“ it's important."
