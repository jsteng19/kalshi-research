Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemns the terrorist attack against the US Embassy in Turkey and shares in the sorrow of the Turkish people.

Prime Minister Netanyahu sent the following letter to US President Barack Obama:

"Dear Mr. President,

I was shocked and saddened to learn of the vicious terrorist attack against the US Embassy in Ankara.

Such acts of wanton violence remind us of the dangers faced by those who courageously represent us abroad and of the threats which those who despise freedom continue to pose to those who love liberty and life.

Our hearts are with you, with bereaved family members, and with the American people.

Benjamin Netanyahu"
