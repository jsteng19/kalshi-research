Following is an excerpt from Prime Minister Netanyahu's remarks, at a meeting of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee:

"Yesterday I took the position of Defense Minister. I met with IDF Chief-of-Staff Lt.-Gen. Gadi Eizenkot and his designated successor [Maj.-Gen.] Aviv Kochavi. We are ready for all challenges.

As I said last night, we are in a campaign that has not yet ended.

At this sensitive security time, it would be irresponsible to topple the government.

Whether our partners decide to topple the government or not, we will continue to take action to ensure the security of our state and of our people. We will do so sensibly, responsibly and with determination.

I rely on the IDF. I rely on the security forces. I rely on the citizens of Israel.

Together we can face any challenge â€“ and we will ensure the security of Israel."
