Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expresses his sorrow over the passing of former Haifa Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi Eliyahu Yosef Sha'ar Yashuv Cohen:

"Rabbi Sha'ar Yashuv Cohen was a great and wise man who always strived for the unity of the Jewish People, just as he worked to bring together various sectors of the population in Haifa, where he served the public as Chief Rabbi for almost 30 years.

In his life he combined the book and the sword: An Irgun veteran who fought in the War of Independence, he was wounded in the battle for the Old City of Jerusalem, and eventually joined the IDF.

Rabbi Sha'ar Yashuv Cohen was a pleasant man, sharp and very learned, who combined his Torah learning with acts of lovingkindness and sought to instill peace among us. He left behind him many religious court judges and students, residents and neighbors for whom he was a spiritual leader and authority in Jewish law, as well as many deep and fascinating stories, that will continue to remind us of his legacy for generations to come. May his memory be blessed."
