Hamas is ISIS, and I think what you said and in many ways the President has said, in many ways Hamas is worse than ISIS. And just as the entire civilized world united to fight ISIS, the united civilized world has to unite to help us fight Hamas. I know that you stand with us and I appreciate it mightily."

US Secretary of Defense Austin:

"We're with you, Mr. Prime Minister. As the President said, we have your back. And it's an awful week. Disgusting acts by this terrorist group. And as you know, I was the guy that initially put the ISIS campaign together. And I know a lot about ISIS, and this is worse than what I saw with ISIS. We do stand with you, Mr. Prime Minister."
