Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, at the Knesset, made the following remarks:

"We are all praying for the wellbeing of the wounded from last night's terrorist attack in Ofra. We support the doctors who are fighting for the baby's life. Abhorrent terrorists tried to murder a mother and the baby in her womb. This is monstrous.

There are, of course, cries of joy; I think it is too much to expect a condemnation from the Palestinian Authority. They only contribute to incitement here. Our security forces – the ISA and the IDF – are pursuing the murderers. They will capture them. We will deal with them to the fullest extent of the law and settle accounts with them."
