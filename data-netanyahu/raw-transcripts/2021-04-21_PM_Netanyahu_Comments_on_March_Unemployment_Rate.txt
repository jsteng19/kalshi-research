Prime Minister Netanyahu:"For the first time, the monthly unemployment rate has dropped below 10%. The rate of unemployment for March is 9.5% as opposed to 14% in February. From 25% unemployment at the peak of the crisis, we have succeeded in reaching the goal of less than 10%, and it will continue to decline. This is happening thanks to the millions of vaccines that we brought to Israel and which have led to the opening of the Israeli economy and its jump forward, and to getting back to life."
