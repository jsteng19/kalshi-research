Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, yesterday evening, at his Jerusalem residence, met with local council heads from the south of the country and told them: "The IDF acted with strength, and as soon as the operation's goals were achieved – we ended it. We will continue to closely monitor the situation to see to it that the quiet is maintained. If it is violated, the IDF is ready to respond strongly. I salute the residents of the south. Their resilience enabled us to achieve the goals that we set."

Be'er Sheva Mayor Rubik Danilovich, at the start of the meeting, said, "This operation has a prominent achievement – Israel's strong home front."
