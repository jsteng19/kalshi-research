Prime Minister Netanyahu and Finance Minister Yisrael Katz decided to extend the eligibility for unemployment compensation until the middle of August. In this context, eligibility for grants to people over 67 who have not returned to work will also be extended. At the end of this period, the extension of eligibility will be re-evaluated in light of employment data in the economy. The decision was made in an economic consultation – with Bank of Israel Governor Prof. Amir Yaron and National Economic Council head Prof. Avi Simhon – pursuant to the government policy of providing incentives for economic activity and encouraging a return to work, together with a commitment to looking after whoever has not returned to work. In order to facilitate the rapid completion of the legislation, this article will be entered as an amendment to the law on grants for people over 67, which has been tabled for its second and third readings in the Knesset.

Prime Minister Netanyahu: "I agreed with Finance Minister Katz to extend the eligibility for unemployment compensation until the middle of August. This is part of the steps that we are taking to revive the economy, and look after the self-employed and the unemployed. People need to make a living. In an economic consultation that I held with the Finance Minister, Bank of Israel Governor Prof. Yaron and my economic adviser, Prof. Simhon, we determined that in the middle of August we would evaluate the macro-economic and employment conditions, and would announce additional steps."
