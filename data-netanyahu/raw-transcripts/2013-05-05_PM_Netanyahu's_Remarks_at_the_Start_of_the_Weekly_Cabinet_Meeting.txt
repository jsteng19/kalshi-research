Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made the following remarks at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting, which was held at the Herzl Museum on Mt. Herzl, in honor of Jerusalem Day:

"We are marking Jerusalem Day here in the museum on Mt. Herzl. Herzl said, 'In Basel, I founded the Jewish State' and in Jerusalem we are developing the Jewish State and ensuring its future.

There is no place more fitting from which to call on the children and citizens of Israel to come visit Jerusalem, to come to this museum, to see the greatness of this man, who was one of the giants of history. I think that it was his vision and his strength, which breathed life into a scattered and weak people that was unable to see to its own fate, that brought us here â€“ to a new life. It would be proper for every boy and girl in Israel, and the many who visit here, to understand our roots, our ties to Zion and our obligation to continue developing our land and our state for the coming generations.

I am also pleased to tell you that we can mark a very important development in Jerusalem. In recent years, there has been very strong momentum in all areas: Education, culture, sports, transportation, tourism, and science and medicine. There has been very major development in all these areas. Jerusalem is becoming a modern metropolis with a very strong link to the past and a very promising leap to the future. This is exactly what Herzl envisioned; by the way, this is how he wrote about Jerusalem and about the entire Land of Israel.

I am pleased that we are cooperating on this. This meeting expresses the Government's commitment to continue the momentum, along with the Municipality of Jerusalem and with all ministries, in all areas, so that this change, this turning point might continue unabated."
