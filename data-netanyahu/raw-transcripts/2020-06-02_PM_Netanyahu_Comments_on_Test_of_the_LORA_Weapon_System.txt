Prime Minister Netanyahu on the test of the LORA weapon system:

"Parallel with our war on corona, we are continuing to safeguard Israel's security â€“ on defense and offense. Well done to IAI and the defense establishment. Today's successful test is good news for the citizens of Israel and more bad news for Israel's enemies."
