Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today visited an IDF base on Mt. Avital on the Golan Heights and made the following remarks:

"I visit the Golan Heights from time to time, just as I did on the Egyptian border. We are monitoring the changes taking place in Syria, and many changes are taking place. They affect Israel's security. As you heard from the officers, we are – first of all – building an enhanced ground barrier, from here to the point where the three borders meet on the southern Golan Heights. I would like to examine the possibility of extending this fence up to Mt. Hermon so that there will be a strong buffer along the length of our border with Syria. Of course we are monitoring what is happening on the other side of this buffer inside Syria regarding the rebels taking over and any movements vis-à-vis the chemical weapons. This is not only an Israeli matter; we are in close contact with the US on this issue. This is a strategic interest for both countries."
