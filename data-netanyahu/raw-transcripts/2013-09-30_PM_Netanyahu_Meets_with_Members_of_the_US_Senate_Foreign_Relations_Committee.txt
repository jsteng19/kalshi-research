Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with members of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He previously met with members of Congress at a farewell event for outgoing Israeli Ambassador to the US Michael Oren. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-VA), Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) and Minority Whip Steny H. Hoyer (D-MD) also spoke at the event.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said that he had one message for those at the event, that they must continue to apply pressure. He noted that he had expressed his appreciation to US President Obama for the regime of harsh sanctions that has induced Iran to enter into a dialogue in order to extract itself from the situation. The Prime Minister expressed his personal appreciation to those in attendance for their contributions and noted that many of them had worked for many years to achieve this.

Prime Minister thanked Ambassador Oren for faithfully serving the State of Israel and said that all present were aware of his outstanding qualities. The Prime Minister asserted that Oren had been an exceptional ambassador who had served as a human bridge between Israel and the US.
