On the occasion of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's 61st birthday today his Bureau staff, along with his family, held a surprise toast for him. At 17:30, his secretariat asked him to go to the Cabinet room, where his wife Sara, his sons Yair and Avner, his Bureau staff, drivers and other Prime Minister's Office employees greeted him enthusiastically and sang "Happy Birthday."

Cabinet Secretary Tzvi Hauser and the Prime Minister's Military Secretary, Maj.-Gen. Yohanan Loker thanked him for, "putting in long hours, around the clock, on behalf of the State of Israel and its security," and for being a father figure for the Bureau staff.

Prime Minister Netanyahu thanked his family and Bureau staff: "I have been blessed with a good and supportive family. I have sons and a wife who look out for both me and the country. On the one hand, we have our everyday life, with the boys' school tests and army experiences. On the other hand, we must be concerned with the existence of the State, which is not a given. This principle is very deeply rooted in our family life. I am pleased to have this excellent and loyal Bureau staff and I thank you all."
