Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today:

"Anonymous sources briefed The New York Times that Israel will be prepared to end the war before all of its objectives are achieved.

I do not know who these anonymous sources are, but I am here to make it unequivocally clear: This will not happen. The war will end once Israel achieves all of its objectives, including the destruction of Hamas and the release of all of our hostages.

The Government directed the IDF to achieve these war objectives and the IDF has all the means to achieve them. We will not capitulate to the winds of defeatism, neither in The New York Times nor anywhere else. We are inspired by the spirit of victory."
