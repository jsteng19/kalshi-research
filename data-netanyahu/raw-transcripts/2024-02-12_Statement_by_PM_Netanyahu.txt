Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this morning:

"Fernando and Louis, welcome home.

I salute our brave fighters for the daring action that led to their release. Only continued military pressure, until total victory, will bring about the release of all of our hostages.

We will not miss any opportunity to bring them home."
