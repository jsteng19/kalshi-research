Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, at the start of his meeting with Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, commented on the case of the soldier in Hebron:

"As the father of a soldier and as Prime Minister, I would like to reiterate: The IDF backs its soldiers. I am convinced that an examination of the event in Hebron will be done responsibly and sagaciously. In my familiarity with the military justice system, I am convinced that the court will consider all circumstances regarding the incident. Our soldiers are not murderers.

They act against murderers and I hope that a way will be found to balance between the action and the overall context of the event. In the meantime I suggest that everyone lower the flames."
