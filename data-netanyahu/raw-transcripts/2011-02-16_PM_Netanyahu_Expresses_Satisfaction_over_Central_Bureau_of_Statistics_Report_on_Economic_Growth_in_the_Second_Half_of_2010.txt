Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today expressed satisfaction over the

Central Bureau of Statistics report that the economy grew by 5.4% in the second half of 2010

"This sharp growth attests to an increase in Israeli citizens' standard of living. This stems from a responsible economic policy that does not violate the budgetary framework. The Government of Israel is investing considerable funds in advancing infrastructures, bringing the periphery closer to the center, creating jobs, and encouraging exports. This policy has brought over 100,000 jobs in the past year and has lowered unemployment to the lowest level in the western world."

Prime Minister Netanyahu added that this was good socio-economic news for everyone in the country and said that he and Finance Minister Yuval Steinitz would continue to maintain this responsible policy in the future as well.
