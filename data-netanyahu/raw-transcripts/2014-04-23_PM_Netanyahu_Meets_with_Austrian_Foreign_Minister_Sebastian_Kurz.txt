Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in his Jerusalem office, met with Austrian Europe, Integration and Foreign Affairs Minister Sebastian Kurz, and told him at the start of their meeting: "You're coming at an important time. We're trying to re-launch the negotiations with the Palestinians. Every time we get to that point, Abu Mazen stacks on additional condition which he knows that Israel cannot give. So instead of moving into peace with Israel, he's moving into peace with Hamas. He has to choose. Does he want peace with Hamas or peace with Israel. You can have one but not the other. I hope he chooses peace, so far he hasn't done so."
