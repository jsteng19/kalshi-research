Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, toured Gush Etzion and met with Judea and Samaria council heads. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: “I admit that I am very moved. We are here, in Gush Etzion, a place we were expelled from in the War of Independence. Here we are on a historic day with another tremendous achievement for the State of Israel, which we have greatly worked for. The Trump administration has corrected a historic injustice and lined up with truth and justice. I thank President Trump and Secretary of State Pompeo. This is a very great day for the State of Israel and an achievement that will stand for generations.”
