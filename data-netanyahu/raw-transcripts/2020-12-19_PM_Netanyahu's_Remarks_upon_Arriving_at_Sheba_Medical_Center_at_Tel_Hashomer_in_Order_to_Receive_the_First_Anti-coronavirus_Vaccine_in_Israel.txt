"This is a very great day for the State of Israel. We have been fighting for almost a year against the most severe pandemic that humanity has known in 100 years. By the end of the month, there will be millions of vaccines here, and additional millions will come afterward. I have asked to be vaccinated first, together with Health Minister Yuli Edelstein, in order to serve as a personal example and to encourage all of you to be vaccinated. We can exit this together and we will soon get started. I believe in this vaccine. Tens of thousands of people have received it successfully. The best scientists have approved it. We can get underway."
