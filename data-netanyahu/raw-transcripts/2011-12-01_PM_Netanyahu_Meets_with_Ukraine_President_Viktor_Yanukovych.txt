Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today, in his Jerusalem office, met with Ukraine President Viktor Yanukovych. The two leaders discussed expanding bilateral cooperation in various areas.

At the start of their meeting, Prime Minister Netanyahu welcomed Ukraine President Yanukovych on his first visit to Israel and noted that the two countries had very deep historical and cultural ties. "Ukrainian Jews greatly contributed to the building up and development of the State of Israel at its outset, and to the revival of the Hebrew language. Almost 350,000 newcomers from Ukraine came to Israel in the great wave of immigration in the 1990's and they are continuing to strengthen and develop the State of Israel," the Prime Minister said.
