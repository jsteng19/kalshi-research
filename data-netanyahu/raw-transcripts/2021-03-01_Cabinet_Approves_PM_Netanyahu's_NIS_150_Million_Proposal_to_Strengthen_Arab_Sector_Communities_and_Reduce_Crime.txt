Following staff work carried out by Prime Minister's Office Acting Director General Braverman pursuant to a directive by Prime Minister Netanyahu, along with the request of Arab sector community representatives to take part in the effort to defeat crime and violence, and following Prime Minister Netanyahu's meetings in recent weeks with the local authority heads, the Cabinet, today (Monday, 1 March 2021), approved the plan to strengthen Arab sector communities. To implement the decision, NIS 150 million has been allocated to build and expand five new and existing police stations, two fire stations and multi-purpose buildings for community services in Arab communities, and establish a special Israel Police unit dedicated to the fight against crime in the Arab sector. The decision adopts the principles for action that were formulated by a team of government ministry director generals, which was formed on instruction from Prime Minister Netanyahu in order to deal with the crime and violence. The decision also determines that the Public Security Ministry and the Israel Police will advance two organized campaigns to collect weapons and will carry out expedited operational activity to seize illegal weaponry in Arab sector communities. An inter-ministerial team will also be formed to deal with the bringing in of illegal weaponry to Israeli territory. The plan also includes an approximately NIS 1 million (from the Prime Minister's Office budget) information campaign against violence in Arab society. A professional team will work to advance plans to deal with family violence that has become ingrained in Arab sector communities by giving the communities the flexibility to adapt the plans to the special needs of Arab society. Additional actions will be taken to strengthen Arab society and social-community frameworks for dealing with crime and violence. This plan will be carried out in coordination with the Prime Minister's Office, and the Finance, Public Security, Education, Interior, Labor, Social Affairs and Social Services, Social Equality, and Community Advancement and Strengthening ministries, led by Prime Minister's Office Acting Director General Braverman.
