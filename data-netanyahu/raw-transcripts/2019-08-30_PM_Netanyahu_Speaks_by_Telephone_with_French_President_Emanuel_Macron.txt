Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, spoke by telephone with French President Emanuel Macron; the conversation was at the initiative of the French side. Prime Minister Netanyahu said that Israel would defend itself against aggression against it and would prevent its enemies who seek its destruction from arming themselves with lethal weaponry. Prime Minister Netanyahu emphasized that those who provide shelter for aggression and arming will not be immune and added that the present – when Iran is stepping up its aggression in the region – is precisely the wrong time to talk with Iran.
