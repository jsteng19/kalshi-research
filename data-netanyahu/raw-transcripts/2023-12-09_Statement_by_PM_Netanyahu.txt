Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening :

"I greatly appreciate the correct stance that the US has taken in the UN Security Council.

The other countries need to understand that, on the one hand, it is impossible to support the elimination of Hamas while, on the other hand, calling for a halt to the war, which will prevent the elimination of Hamas.

Therefore, Israel will continue our just war to eliminate Hamas and achieve the other goals of the war that we have set.
