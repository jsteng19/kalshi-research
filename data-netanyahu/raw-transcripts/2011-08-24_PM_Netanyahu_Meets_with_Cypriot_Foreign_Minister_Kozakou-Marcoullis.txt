Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met today in Jerusalem, with Cypriot Foreign Minister Dr. Erato Kozakou-Marcoullis. The Prime Minister noted the improvement in Israel-Cyprus relations and said that, "We are two eastern Mediterranean democracies with common values and overlapping interests." He called for the further tightening of bilateral relations in order to, "compensate for the gaps that were created in previous decades."

Prime Minister Netanyahu and Cypriot Foreign Minister Kozakou-Marcoullis discussed – inter alia – the possible expansion of energy cooperation given that both countries have been blessed with natural gas reserves in their maritime economic zones.

Prime Minister Netanyahu called on Cyprus not to support the Palestinian move at the UN. "Peace cannot be advanced by unilateral moves at the UN," the Prime Minister said.

Cypriot Foreign Minister Kozakou-Marcoullis invited the Prime Minister to visit Cyprus; such a visit would be the first by an Israeli Prime Minister. The Prime Minister said that he welcomes the possibility of visiting Cyprus and hopes to do so soon.
