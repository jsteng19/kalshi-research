Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will this morning undergo a

colonoscopy

at Hadassah Ein Kerem Hospital in Jerusalem; Prof. Eran Goldin will carry out the test.

Approximately a year and a half ago, the Prime Minister had a routine colonoscopy, during which a small polyp was discovered, removed and found to be benign. According to medical protocol, the Prime Minister needed a repeat colonoscopy 18 months later; this will be done this morning.

Prime Minister Netanyahu will also undergo a

cystoscopy

; Prof. Dov Podeh will carry out the test. Approximately 30 years ago, a small benign polyp was discovered in the Prime Minister's bladder. A repeat test carried out approximately ten years ago was completely normal. It was decided to perform both the colonoscopy and the cystoscopy this morning.

During the tests, Prime Minister will be lightly anesthetized for a short time. Cabinet Secretary Tzvi Hauser reports that the Prime Minister arranged for a temporary acting replacement to be named should it prove necessary, in consultation with Attorney General Meni Mazuz.
