Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening, spoke with the Head of IDF Central Command, the Head of the Judea and Samaria Division, the commander of the Israel National Counter-Terrorism Unit, the commander of the Border Police, ISA operational unit commanders and his Military Secretary, and was updated on additional details of today's operation in Jenin. Prime Minister Netanyahu: "This was an exceptional intelligence and operational achievement. This is already the fourth action that you have carried out recently in the heart of the terrorist bases located in refugee camps. These operations are of immense value. By your actions, you are sending a clear and sharp message to all who are thinking about murdering an Israeli citizen: We will settle accounts with you. Convey my deepest appreciation – and that of the entire people of Israel – to the soldiers, to the men and women of the security establishment."
