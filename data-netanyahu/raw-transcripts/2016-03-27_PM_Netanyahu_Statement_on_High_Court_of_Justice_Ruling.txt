Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today issued the following statement:

"The High Court of Justice decision severely threatens the development of the gas reserves of the State of Israel.

Israel is seen as a state with excessive judicial interference in which it is difficult to do business.

Certainly nobody has any reason to celebrate that the gas is liable to remain in the depths of the sea and that hundreds billions of shekels will not reach the citizens of Israel.

We will seek other ways to overcome the severe damage that this curious decision has caused the Israeli economy."
