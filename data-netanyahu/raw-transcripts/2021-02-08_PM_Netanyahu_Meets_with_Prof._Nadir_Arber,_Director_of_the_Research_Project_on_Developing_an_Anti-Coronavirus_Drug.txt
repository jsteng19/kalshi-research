Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem, met with Prof. Nadir Arber, the director of the research project on developing an anti-coronavirus drug, and was updated on the progress in developing the drug, which is in the experimental stage at Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center.

Also participating in the meeting were Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center CEO Prof. Ronni Gamzu and Dr. Sharon Shapiro, the director of the lab in which the drug EXO-CD24 is being tested.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"If this succeeds, it will be huge, simply huge. This is of global significance. This is amazing. I wish you success. If you need anything, say it and we will help you. This little thing could change the fate of humanity. This is amazing. Good luck."

Prime Minister discussed this with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, who expressed great interest and also offered that a leading Greek hospital take part in the clinical trials in the framework of bilateral cooperation.

Prof. Arber noted that the project involved out-of-the-box thinking and explained that the drug could be produced quickly and efficiently.
