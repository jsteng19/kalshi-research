Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this afternoon [translated from Hebrew]: "I send heartfelt condolences to the family of Meir Tamari, who was murdered today in a shooting attack near his home community of Hermesh. May G-d avenge him. Our forces are currently in pursuit of the terrorists in order to settle accounts with them, and they will be settled forthwith. Just as we have found every terrorist and closed accounts with them, we will do so this time as well."
