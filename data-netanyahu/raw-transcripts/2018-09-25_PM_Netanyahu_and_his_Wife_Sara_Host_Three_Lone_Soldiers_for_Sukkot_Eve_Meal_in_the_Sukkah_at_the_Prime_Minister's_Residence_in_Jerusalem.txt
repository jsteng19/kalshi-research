Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara, in their sukkah at the Prime Minister's Residence in Jerusalem, hosted three lone soldiers for a Sukkot eve meal.

Prime Minister Netanyahu told the soldiers: "We are moved and happy to host you among our family on the holyday eve."

The three soldiers are: Cpl. Eden Glick, who serves in a Home Front Command search and rescue unit; Cpl. Jeremy Greener, who serves on a navy patrol boat and who immigrated to Israel from Washington DC approximately two years ago in the framework of the Garin Tzabar program after studying for a degree; and Cpl. Julian Katzenmeier who immigrated to Israel from Canada approximately 18 months ago, after having served in the Canadian military.
