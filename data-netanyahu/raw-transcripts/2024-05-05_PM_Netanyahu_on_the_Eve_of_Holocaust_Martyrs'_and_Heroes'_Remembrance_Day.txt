Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, on the eve of Holocaust Martyrs' and Heroes' Remembrance Day:

"This evening we will honor the memory of our six million brothers and sisters who were murdered in the Holocaust.

Last Thursday, my wife Sara and I met with the Holocaust survivors who will light the memorial torches this evening. We met with 96-year-old Izi Kabilio, a Holocaust survivor, from Yugoslavia. He told us about the horrors he, his family and his friends endured, and told us: 'Today, the State of Israel is the one and only haven for the Jewish People.'

Michael Bar-On, another survivor who will light a torch this evening, told us: 'We cannot rely on the nations of the world who make promises.'

These heroic survivors are right.

In the terrible Holocaust, there were great world leaders who stood by idly; therefore, the first lesson of the Holocaust is: If we do not defend ourselves, nobody will defend us. And if we need to stand alone, we will stand alone.

Therefore, we will defend ourselves in every way. We will overcome our enemies and we will ensure our security â€“ in the Gaza Strip, on the Lebanese border, everywhere."
