Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this evening at his official residence in Jerusalem, met with New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Mayor Bloomberg gave Prime Minister Netanyahu a US flag that was flown in Washington in a call for Gilad Shalit's release. The flag was taken down last week; Mayor Bloomberg presented it to Prime Minister Netanyahu as a token of appreciation. Prime Minister Netanyahu reiterated Israel's offer to dispatch humanitarian aid to Turkey following the severe earthquake that struck eastern Turkey earlier today. "Just as Turkey aided Israel during the Carmel wildfire, so too do I hope that it will respond to our proposal and accept the assistance that we are offering."
