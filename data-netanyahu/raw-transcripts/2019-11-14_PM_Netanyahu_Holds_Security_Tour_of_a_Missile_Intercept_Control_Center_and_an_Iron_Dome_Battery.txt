Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, held a security tour of a missile intercept control center and an Iron Dome battery. IDF air defense commander Brig.-Gen. Ran Kochav briefed the Prime Minister on air defense network activity in recent days. The Prime Minister also spoke with air defense soldiers and technicians at an Iron Dome battery. Prime Minister Netanyahu: “I would like to commend the soldiers and commanders for the extraordinary achievement of our defense system, which performed very well, along with the civilians who followed IDF Home Front Command instructions. As of now, we have succeeded in preventing injuries of any kind. We are approaching the end of the operation. First of all, I can praise the IDF and ISA for a great achievement and thank my fellow Security Cabinet members for the responsible and daring decision to launch this operation. The goals of the operation have now been fully achieved. The goal of the operation was to target the commander of Islamic Jihad in the Gaza Strip. He was eliminated along with dozens of terrorists and dozens of important Islamic Jihad infrastructure targets. Our enemies received the message. We can reach everyone. We can reach everyone, even in their bed. I hope that this lesson will be learned. I rely on our forces. We will continue to improve and do whatever may be necessary to ensure the security of Israel. Well done and thank you.”
