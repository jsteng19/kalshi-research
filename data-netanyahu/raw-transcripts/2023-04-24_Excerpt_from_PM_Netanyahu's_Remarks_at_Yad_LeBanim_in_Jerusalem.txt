Following is an excerpt from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks, today , at the ceremony for the Fallen of Israel's Wars at Yad LeBanim in Jerusalem:

"A few minutes ago, not far from here, there was another attempt to murder Israeli citizens. This terrorist attack, in this place, at this time, reminds us that the land of Israel and the State of Israel are acquired through many trials and tribulations.

These terrorist attacks come with the expectation that they will overcome us and will uproot us from here, and if they could, they would murder us all. But they will not overcome us; we will overcome them. We have established an exemplary state with an exemplary army and police, at a heart-rending price."
