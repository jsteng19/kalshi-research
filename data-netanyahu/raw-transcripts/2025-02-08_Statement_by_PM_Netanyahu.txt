Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening:

"Or, Eli and Ohad returned home today. Sara and I embrace them, and their dear families.

We have again seen the monsters of Hamas. These are the same monsters who slaughtered our citizens and abused our hostages. I say to them again: They will pay the price.

We will do everything to return all of our hostages. We will see to their safety. This is the directive that I gave to the delegation â€“ say this to the mediators and demand it.

But beyond this, President Trump agrees with me completely: We will do everything to return all of the hostages, but Hamas will not be there.

We will eliminate Hamas, and we will return our hostages.
