Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today (Tuesday), 12.1.10, ordered that work begin, by the end of this month, on the laying of a natural gas pipeline to Haifa. He also decided to advance the paving of a section of

Highway #6

from Yokneam to Nahariya and the laying of a railway line from Haifa to Beit Shean along

the route of the natural gas pipeline in the Kishon Basin.

Public Security Minister Yitzhak Aharonovitch, National Infrastructures Minister Uzi Landau, Environmental Protection Minister Gilad Erdan, Deputy Finance Minister Yitzhak Cohen, Prime Minister's Office Director-General Eyal Gabai, Israel Police Commissioner Dudi Cohen and other senior officials attended this evening's discussion, at which the aforesaid decisions were made.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said that, "The decision signifies the opening of a bottleneck that will impart momentum to the development of the Galilee, including investments in tourism and transportation, and reduce the air pollution that the greater Haifa metropolitan area suffers from.

This decision is important for the health, quality of life and economic prosperity of hundreds of thousands of Israelis in the north of the country. The Kishon Basin is the north's bottleneck vis-Ã -vis infrastructures, transportation and energy. It is a supreme national interest of the State of Israel to resolve this transportation and public health issue and this is what we have done today with the decision we have taken."

Regarding Druze landowners through whose holdings the infrastructures will run, Prime Minister Netanyahu said that, "We will show openness and sensitivity regarding the needs of this important and dear sector. The

Israeli Druze

are our brothers. I know that they have special concerns and rights and we will take these into account."
