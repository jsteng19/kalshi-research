Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this morning (Tuesday), 1.3.11, during his visit to Upper Nazareth, commented on recent events in Libya and said that the West must respond vigorously towards the killing in Iran as well:

"Libya is a systematic violator of human rights and does not deserve any immunity. I think that Iran is also a systematic violator of human rights that does not deserve any immunity. If the international community exerts special pressure on Libya and warns its rulers and soldiers against human rights violations, the same exact warning must also be directed to the rulers and troops of Iran. If the international community is considering very assertive steps against Libya, the same steps must be directed against Iran as well.

While Gadhafi slaughters his opponents, the ayatollahs' regime in Iran is systematically executing its opponents. Therefore, the West's response must be very resolute towards both places. I believe that such a vigorous response will send a very clear message of hope and encouragement to the Iranian people, that they have not been forgotten and that we are all cognizant of their struggle for freedom and liberty."
