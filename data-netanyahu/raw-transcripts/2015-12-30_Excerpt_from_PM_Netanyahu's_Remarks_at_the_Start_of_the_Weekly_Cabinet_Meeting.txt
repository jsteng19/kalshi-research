Following is an excerpt from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks at the start of the Cabinet meeting today :

"At the start of my remarks, I would like to send condolences to the family of Genady Kaufman. Genady was the gardener at the Tomb of the Patriarchs [Machpelah Cave]. He was stabbed in a murderous assault several weeks ago. Sadly, he did not recover. This morning as well, I say to all those who would uproot us from the Tomb of the Patriarchs â€“ except for a few years in the previous century, we have been there for almost 4,000 years and we will stay there forever. You cannot defeat us."
