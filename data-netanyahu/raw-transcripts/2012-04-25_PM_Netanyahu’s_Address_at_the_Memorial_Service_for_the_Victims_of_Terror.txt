The atrocities carried out by terrorists against our people know no moral boundaries, nor political boundaries. The malice and hatred of the terrorists is insatiable. One thing that these murderers all have in common is their desire to annihilate the Jewish people and to uproot it from its land, the Land of Israel. They will not succeed.

We are here in Jerusalem, and we will remain in Jerusalem â€“ our united capital, and the holy city of the Jewish people from time immemorial. We will not move from here; we will not stop building; we will not cease creating; we will continue developing and strengthening our state, and living, growing and settling our children and grandchildren in it.

I see this determination engraved deep in our people. I see it in the families of the fallen; I have seen it in the members of the Fogel and Ben Yishai families; I saw it in the families of those murdered in Toulouse; and I see it in you, in each and every one of you, the members of the bereaved families.

For 64 years, we have been steadfastly holding on to our country, and that is precisely what we will continue doing. They kill and we build. In the historic tally, the Jewish people has always prevailed over its bitter enemies. They passed from the world, but we are here. I know that the price that you, the members of the families, have paid is unbearably heavy.

So I want to express my own gratitude and the gratitude of the entire nation for your standing strong, and for your courage.

The memory of your loved ones will forever echo in our hearts.

May their memory be blessed.
