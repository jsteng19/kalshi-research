Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today, ordered that the amount of tax-exempt goods that may be purchased on the Internet be raised by 20%.

The increase, which the Cabinet approved earlier today, will be on the purchase of NIS 1,200 worth of goods. The exemption does not need legislation and will take effect as soon as Finance Minister Yuval Steinitz signs the order.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said that, "The tax exemption on Internet purchases will increase competitiveness and lower prices. This is an additional step in the framework of approving the Trajtenberg benefits to lower the cost of living."
