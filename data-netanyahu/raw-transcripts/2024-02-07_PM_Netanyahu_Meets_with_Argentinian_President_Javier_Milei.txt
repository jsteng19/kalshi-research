Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem, met with Argentinian President Javier Milei, first privately and then in an expanded meeting during which the Prime Minister thanked the President for his decision to declare Hamas a terrorist organization and for his unwavering support for Israel's right to defend itself.

The two also agreed on the launch of joint business delegations in various areas.

Prime Minister Netanyahu at the start of the meeting:

"I'm delighted to welcome you, President Milei, and your delegation, to Israel. You're a great friend of the Jewish state. We are delighted with your decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital and move your diplomatic post there, and also, of course, an embassy.

We had a conversation now discussing free markets. This is something that we both champion, and you are leading this in Argentina. We have led this in Israel. We can do a lot more together.

We share the desire for prosperity, security and peace. We know that the greatest challenge to peace in our area, but also in yours, is Iran. And we appreciate the cooperation that we are doing with you in security and diplomacy.

Your stalwart support for Israel in so many forms is deeply, deeply appreciated.

Welcome to Jerusalem. Welcome, friend."
