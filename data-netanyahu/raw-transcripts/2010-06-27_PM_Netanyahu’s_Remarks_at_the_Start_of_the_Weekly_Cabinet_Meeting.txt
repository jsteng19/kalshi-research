Following are excerpts from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting today:

"Friday marked the fourth anniversary of the abduction of

Gilad Shalit

. The Government and the security services are continuing to make constant and varied – open and secret – efforts to bring Gilad Shalit back home safe and sound.

This morning, I phoned Gilad's father Noam. I invited him to meet with me, along with the rest of his family, immediately after the march reaches Jerusalem. I told him, "I know Noam that you are on a long journey, which will end in Jerusalem. I want to see you. I would be glad to meet with you." This will not be the first meeting. Of course, I have spoken with him many times. Recently, I also spoke with Gilad's very impressive grandfather, Tzvi Shalit.

Our heart is with Gilad and with his family. Four years after his abduction, I call on the international community to line up alongside the State of Israel and our unequivocal and just demand that our abducted soldier be returned immediately."
