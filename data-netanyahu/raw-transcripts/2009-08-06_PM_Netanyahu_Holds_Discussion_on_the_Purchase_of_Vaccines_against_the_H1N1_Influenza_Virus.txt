Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this evening met with Finance Minister Yuval Steinitz and Deputy Health Minister Yaakov Litzman on the issue of the purchase of vaccines against the H1N1 influenza virus for the entire population of Israel. They discussed several alternatives for the immediate order of options to purchase vaccines from various pharmaceutical firms around the world. As is known, the anti-influenza vaccines are still in the development stage and are not yet on the shelf. Various possibilities – based on preparatory work by a Health Ministry professional team – were discussed concerning stocks of vaccines currently under development around the world and the dates on which they are expected to go into production.

Prime Minister Netanyahu, Finance Minister Steinitz and Deputy Health Minister Litzman agreed that the Health Ministry would, in the coming days, purchase options worth approximately NIS 20 million from a leading European pharmaceutical concern. The vaccines are due to be available at the start of 2010.
