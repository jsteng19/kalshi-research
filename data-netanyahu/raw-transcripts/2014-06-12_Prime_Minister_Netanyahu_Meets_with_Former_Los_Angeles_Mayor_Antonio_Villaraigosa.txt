Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, met with former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and said at the start of their meeting:

"You know that we are fighting terrorism. Our policy is simple â€“ we will strike at those who would strike at us. Yesterday, the IDF and the ISA carried out a precise operation and took strong action against terrorists in Gaza. I remind everyone that this is the true face of Hamas, even as it is part of the same unity government with Abu Mazen. Abu Mazen has promised to honor all of the Palestinian Authority's commitments; among these he has promised to dismantle the terrorist infrastructure in Gaza so that people like those we struck yesterday will not act against us. This is his commitment; we expect him to uphold it."
