Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, traveled together from Ben Gurion International Airport to the Danziger Flower Farm at Mishmar Hashiva, where they were accompanied by Agriculture Minister Uri Ariel.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"The Volcani Institute, which does a lot of this research, I think it's the most advanced agricultural research institute in the world. I'd say none is more advanced. That's the way I would say it to be sufficiently humble. But, these people are doing remarkable things and you can increase the productivity of crops, of irrigation, of soil, livestock with the kind of groundbreaking research that they're doing. One thing you haven't resolved is how to bring down the temperature in a greenhouse. It's too costly."

The Danziger Farm named a variety of white chrysanthemum after Prime Minister Netanyahu and Indian Prime Minister Modi.
