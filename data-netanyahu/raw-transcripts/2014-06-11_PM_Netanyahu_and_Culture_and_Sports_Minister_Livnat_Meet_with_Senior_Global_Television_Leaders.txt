Minister Livnat welcomed the television industry leaders to Israel: "The state of Israel is known and recognized as a start-up in high-tech and advanced technology but it is also making a name for itself as a successful start-up in developing original content and programs that are featured in many countries and have become dizzying successes. I believe that thanks to this success, cooperation between Israel and the Academy will grow in the future."
