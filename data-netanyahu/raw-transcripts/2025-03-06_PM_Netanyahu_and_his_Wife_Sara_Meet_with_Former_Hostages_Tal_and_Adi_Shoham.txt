During the warm two-hour meeting, the Prime Minister and his wife heard from Tal about the difficult period that he and the other hostages endured in captivity, the hostages' daily suffering, his fellow hostages Guy Gilboa-Dalal and Evyatar David, who remain in captivity, and about the brutal psychological warfare they were subjected to by Hamas terrorists.
