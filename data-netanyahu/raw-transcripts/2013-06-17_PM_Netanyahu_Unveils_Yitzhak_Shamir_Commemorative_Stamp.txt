Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today unveiled a new stamp in memory of Israel's seventh prime minister, the late Yitzhak Shamir. Also participating in the ceremony were the latter's son, Agriculture Minister Yair Shamir, Communications Minister Gilad Erdan, Israel Post Chairman of the Board Sasi Shilo, Israel Post CEO Haim Elmozino and the designer of the stamp, Ilan Eliezer Hagari.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said, "Prime Minister Shamir's record is expressed in the appreciation that the state gives him and it is not merely that he is portrayed in a stamp of the State of Israel. I think that Shamir is also worthy of this for all the reasons that have been mentioned here. I collected stamps in my youth and my stamp collection is a box in the basement. I will be proud to add the stamp in memory of Yitzhak Shamir to my collection."

Communications Minister Erdan said, "Prime Minister Shamir said what was in his heart regardless of what he thought others might say. He was a man of principles who was committed to the People and Land of Israel. I am pleased to have had the privilege of honoring his memory."

Israel Post Chairman Shilo said, "Yitzhak Shamir will be remembered for generations as one of the State of Israel's most important leaders. I hope that through this commemorative stamp, which will certainly be seen by many Israelis as they send and receive letters, we will help preserve not only his memory but his heritage, his endless love of the people and the land and his actions on their behalf."
