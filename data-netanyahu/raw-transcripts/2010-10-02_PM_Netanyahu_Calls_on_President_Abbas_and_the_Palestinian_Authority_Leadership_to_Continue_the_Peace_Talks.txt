Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this evening called on President Abbas and the Palestinian Authority leadership to continue the peace talks in order to reach an historic peace agreement within one year.

The Prime Minister said:

"The way to achieve an historic peace agreement between our two peoples is to sit around the negotiating table, seriously and continuously, and not to leave it, because it is the place to resolve the disputes between us. Just one month ago, the Palestinians entered into direct peace talks, without

preconditions

, after my Government carried out a series of unilateral gestures in order to advance these talks. In the previous 17-year period, the Palestinians held direct talks with Israeli governments while construction was being carried out in Judea and Samaria, including in the last year of the previous government. I hope that they will not now turn their backs on peace, and will continue the talks in order to reach a framework agreement within one year."
