Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening, spoke with Druze spiritual leader Shaykh Mowafaq Tarif and updated him that it has been decided to accede to his request and refrain from resuming work on the Golan Heights until after the Eid Al-Adha holiday. The Prime Minister's decision was made upon the recommendation of the ISA Director and the Israel Police Inspector General. The National Security Minister expressed his view that the work should continue tomorrow as well. Prime Minister Netanyahu directed that efforts be made over the coming days to resolve the planning and housing problems in the Druze communities on Mt. Carmel and in the Galilee, which affect the entire Druze community, including young discharged soldiers, who contribute to the security of the state.
