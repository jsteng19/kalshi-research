Following is an excerpt from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks at the start of the Cabinet meeting: "Next week we will open the Knesset winter session. We have very important missions facing us, several of which we will deal with at today's Cabinet meeting: The war against black capital, cutting the bureaucracy that finds expression in excess regulation and – of course – moving forward on dealing with natural gas and the production of electricity via alternative energies. The last thing we need now is elections. The State of Israel needs a stable, strong and responsible government, and I call on all members of the coalition to work together and to continue working together for the benefit of the State of Israel and its citizens."

"Today we mark the beginning of the academic year. On behalf of the Education Minister and all ministers, I would like to wish the hundreds of thousands of students in the State of Israel a productive and successful year. The essence of our entire educational system, including higher education, may be summarized in two words – Zionism and excellence. Zionism, so that we know why we are here, not just where we are going but why we are staying here, and the second thing – excellence. Simply put, let us never compromise on results; it is impossible to compromise on results. A system that does not produce excellence and does not bring out the best in everyone vis-à-vis achievements, is a system that is not realizing what it can do, and the people and State of Israel have proven that they can do quite a lot. Therefore, I am pleased to hear about the Education Minister's plans and I am very interested in moving forward on anything that will promote Zionism and excellence."
