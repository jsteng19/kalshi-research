I would like to say to all of the parents and students – but particularly the parents: I sent my children off to elementary school – first grade, second grade, third grade – not so long ago, and I remember the excitement. I know the same is true for my colleagues: Education Minister Gideon Sa’ar, the Mayor of Modi’in, Chaim Bibas and the Chairman of the Teacher’s Union, Yossi Wasserman. We are all parents; we all have or had children in elementary school. We all know how excited you are, how emotional is it to send your children off to school, and let me tell you – it is even more emotional when they stop going to school and leave home.

These years are precious ones for children, years when they learn things that will stay with them for life. So study hard and enjoy yourselves. Play during recess as much as you want, but during class, study. Learn to read and write, learn math, learn the Bible – learn all these subjects. Does anyone here like Bible class? That’s good. Does anyone here like to read and write? Not just on the internet, but to read books. Who reads books? And what about math? What about English? What about Chinese?

Study hard, but the most important thing I wish for you children is that you learn to be friends with one another. Learn to be good: good children, good sons and daughters to your parents and good citizens for the State of Israel, which belongs to all of us.

I wish you a Happy New Year and much success in your studies.
