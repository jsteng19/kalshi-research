Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued the following statement:

"I express my condolences to the Cheshin family on the passing of Justice Dr. Michael Cheshin who was one of Israel's leading jurists. He possessed a sharp wit, originality and sensitivity.

I saw him in his pride and also during the great tragedy of the loss of his son Shneor. He was a man of considerable knowledge and a great lover of the Tanakh and the Hebrew language, both of which he knew very well."
