Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, departed to Larna Bulgaria.

"I leave now to a summit of countries, and I will meet with my friends, the prime ministers of Bulgaria, Greece, Romania and the Serbian president. This is not just a meeting of friends, but it is, of course, to strengthen relations with each of these countries. Yet it is also a bloc of countries with whom I want to promote my policy, to change the hypocritical and hostile attitude of the EU.

This is a process that will take time, but I believe in setting a goal and striving for it systematically, and I believe that this too will be achieved over time. This is important for the State of Israel, whose status is rising in the world. "

Prime Minister Netanyahu will meet with Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Metodiev Borisov this evening. Tomorrow the Prime Minister will participate in the Craiova Forum and will hold meetings with the leaders of the member countries of the forum: Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov, Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and Romanian Prime Minister Viorica Dăncilă.
