Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting, made the following remarks:

"Israel fully supports the American attack on Syria. They did this for moral reasons in light of the harsh scenes from Idlib and also to make it clear that there is a price for using chemical weapons. There is an international commitment from 2013 to remove all chemical weapons from Syria. As we have seen, this commitment has yet to be fully implemented. We call on the international community to complete the work, and this is an opportunity for American-Russian cooperation in this specific area. This work needs to be completed. Israel is caring for wounded Syrians as part of a humanitarian effort. We will continue to do so.

Today the Cabinet will approve a decision about the celebrations to mark 50 years since the liberation of Judea, Samaria and the Golan Heights. We will also celebrate the liberation of Jerusalem. The Six Day War was one of the greatest victories in the history of Israel. It brought us back to parts of our homeland and completely changed our strategic situation. We will mark the 50th anniversary with a series of events. The main event will take place at Kfar Etzion and I thank Culture Minister Miri Regev and Minister Naftali Bennett for their cooperation in promoting these celebrations.

Tomorrow we will celebrate Seder night. I wish the entire Jewish People and all citizens of Israel a happy Passover. I commend the soldiers and police officers, and the men and women of the ISA, Mossad and all of the security services. They are safeguarding our security and ensuring our freedom. I call on the citizens of Israel to celebrate the holiday. Go out and travel around our beautiful country. Listen to the instructions of the security forces, drive carefully and return home safely."
