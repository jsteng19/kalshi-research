Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Health Minister Yuli Edelstein, today , visited the Maccabi HMO coronavirus vaccine facility in Tel Aviv.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"The ability of the country's HMOs to carry out the mission shows us that we will apparently be able to bring forward vaccinating the population of Israel in the optimal manner, in my opinion, the best in the world. Moreover, of course, we welcome the fact that the American regulatory agency, the Food and Drug Administration, has approved the Pfizer vaccine. We are beginning the end of the pandemic.

Until then, I ask that the rules be strictly followed. There is no reason that we should pay with dead, with tragedies and with severe cases beyond the necessary minimum. We see what is happening in the world, the huge tragedies in the US, Germany, Russia and other parts of Europe. Israel can exit this better. I ask for your cooperation. What I can tell you today is that we are on the way to bringing forward the vaccinations."

Health Minister Edelstein:

"I saw very advanced stages of preparation here. It could be that vaccinations could start earlier, maybe by next week we will be able to start vaccinating the medical teams.

We will still need to fight much fake news. I want to start fighting this even now. We have seen accounts to the effect that several items are lacking. These are mere rumors. Nothing is lacking. The four HMOs are exceptionally well prepared. In the coming days we will bring news to Israel that it will be among the first countries in the world that is vaccinating."
