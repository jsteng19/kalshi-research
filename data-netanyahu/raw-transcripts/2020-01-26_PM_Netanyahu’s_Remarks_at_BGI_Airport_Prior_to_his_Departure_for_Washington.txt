Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today , made the following remarks at Ben-Gurion International Airport prior to his departure for Washington: "Five years ago, I went to the Congress in Washington because I was compelled to stand up against a plan brought by an American president, because I believed such a plan would endanger the vital interests of the State of Israel and its very existence. Today, I leave for Washington to stand alongside an American president, who is offering a plan, which I believe will advance our vital interests. Over the past three years, I have spoken countless times with President Trump, a huge friend of Israel, and with his staff, about our vital interests, our security, and our justice. I am going to meet with President Trump tomorrow. On Tuesday, together with him, we will make history."
