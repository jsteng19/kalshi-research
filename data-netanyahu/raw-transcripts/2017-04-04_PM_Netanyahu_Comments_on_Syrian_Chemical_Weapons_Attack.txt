Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at Mt. Herzl in Jerusalem, at the state memorial ceremony for the late President Chaim Herzog, issued the following statement:

"When I saw pictures of babies suffocating from a chemical attack in Syria, I was shocked and outraged. There's no, none, no excuse whatsoever for the deliberate attacks on civilians and on children, especially with cruel and outlawed chemical weapons. I call on the international community to fulfill its obligation from 2013 to fully and finally remove these horrible weapons from Syria."
