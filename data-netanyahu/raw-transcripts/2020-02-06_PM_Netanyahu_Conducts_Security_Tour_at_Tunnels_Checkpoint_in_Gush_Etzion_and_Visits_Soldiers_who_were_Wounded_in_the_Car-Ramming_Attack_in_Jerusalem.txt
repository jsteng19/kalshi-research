Prime Minister Netanyahu after the visit: "We are here at the tunnels checkpoint. I would like to commend the IDF soldiers, Border Police personnel and the police officers, who are working for our security 24/7. The car-rammer terrorist passed by here and it is only a question of time – not much time – until we apprehend him. I also visited with our wounded soldiers. I wish them, and all the wounded, a full recovery. I would also like to say something to Abu Mazen: This will not help you – not the stabbings, not the car-rammings, not the sniping and not the incitement. We will do everything necessary to protect our security, to set our borders, [and] to ensure our future. We will do this together with you or without you." Prime Minister Netanyahu also spoke with family members at the hospital and wished the wounded a quick and easy recovery. He was briefed on their situation by Hadassah Director Prof. Yoram Weiss and Hadassah Medical Centers Director General Prof. Zeev Rothstein.

All of Israel embraces you."
