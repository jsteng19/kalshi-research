Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Culture and Sports Minister Limor Livnat, on the occasion of Hebrew Book Week, awarded certificates of appreciation to 30 1st-8th grade pupils for outstanding achievements in reading over the past year.

The certificates were awarded after an examination of data from 150 public libraries throughout Israel, including those in – inter alia – Yavne'el, Baqa Al-Garbiyeh, Ra'anana, Rishon LeZion, Kiryat Arba, Metar, Sderot and Yerucham. In each age bracket, the four top readers were selected. Rafael Hadad, a 7th-grade pupil from Safed came in first; he read approximately 650 books in one year. Prime Minister Netanyahu gave him a book with a personal dedication: "To Rafael Hadad, Israel's champion reader for 2013, keep reading, and succeed."

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, "I read a lot. I read a book and I regret that I have reached the end. Sometimes you reach the end and you say that it is a pity that it ended. These are good books, the books that you regret having finished – this is a good book. Usually, if you have free time, a book that interests you and you are caught up in it and you read it – this is an entire world. I ask only one thing from you, what you love to do: Keep reading and expand your knowledge. Not only will this help you in life, it will greatly enrich your lives."

Culture and Sports Minister Livnat said, "You are our champions and are role models for other children. You are proof of the fact that even in the age of Facebook and tablets the love of reading still exists among children. I congratulate you for whom reading and books are an inseparable part of your daily routines and through which you experience new and exciting worlds."
