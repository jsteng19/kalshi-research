Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, released the following statement (click here for YouTube link):

"After the outrageous anti-Israel resolution at the UN, the US House of Representatives voted yesterday resoundingly to support Israel and reject this one-sided resolution.

Democrats and Republicans alike know that the Western Wall isn't occupied territory.

They voted to either repeal the resolution at the UN or change itâ€”and that's exactly what we intend to do.

I want to thank the US House of Representatives which reflects the tremendous support Israel enjoys among the American people.

Thank you, America.

Thank you, Congress."
