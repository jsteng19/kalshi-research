Following is an excerpt from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahuâ€™s remarks, at the memorial ceremony at Mt. Herzl in Jerusalem, for the fallen of Operation Protective Edge: "We are working to achieve calm but we are prepared to embark on a campaign, an extensive military operation to strike at Hamas and Islamic Jihad, a military strike such as they have not yet received. I cannot go into details but those who are involved in these preparations, who are sitting here today, know very well that these are not mere words." Prime Minister Netanyahu added: "We are committed to bringing Oron Shaul and Hadar Goldin, as well as Avra Mengistu and Hisham A-Said, back home. I cannot go into detail here about everything that we are doing but we are doing very much. I bow my head to the bereavement and pain and I cling to my obligation as Prime Minister to see the overall consideration. We are making vigorous efforts on behalf of all IDF MIAs and we proved that we stand by our word when we returned home the late Zachary Baumel."
