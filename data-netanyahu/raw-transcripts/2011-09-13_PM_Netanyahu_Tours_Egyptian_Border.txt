Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this morning toured the fence on the western border with Egypt in order to closely evaluate its construction. He said that the timetable for building the fence would be shortened by an additional three months; construction is thus expected to conclude in September 2012.

Prime Minister Netanyahu declared that, "Israel's border with Egypt is a border of peace. To continue the peace, there must be security and to this end a fence is necessary. Its rapid construction is important for both peace and security."
