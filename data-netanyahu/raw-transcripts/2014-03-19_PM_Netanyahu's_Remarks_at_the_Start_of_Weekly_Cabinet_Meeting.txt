Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made the following remarks at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting this morning:

"Last night, the IDF attacked targets in Syrian territory . These were targets of Syrian elements that not only facilitated, but also cooperated with, the attacks on our forces. Our policy is very clear: We attack those who attack us. We are also, to the best of our ability, interdicting the transfer of weapons by sea, air and land, and this activity will continue.

This is what has led to – in the past year and over the last five years – a low level of terrorism. Last year, it was the lowest in a decade, both in terms of victims and in the launching of missiles and rockets. From time to time we must take vigorous action, as we are now doing, so that this quiet may continue. This vigorous policy is what is responsible for maintaining Israel's security and that of its citizens. Relative to the Middle East as a whole, which is undergoing profound turmoil, Israel is most stable and secure place in the entire region."
