MK Rabbi Yakov Litzman

this evening acceded to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's request to serve as Deputy Health Minister.

MK Litzman has extensive financial and organizational experience. He twice chaired the Knesset Finance Committee and is considered to have been one of its best chairmen ever. He is widely esteemed in the political establishment and is considered to have great organizational and managerial abilities. While he will be Deputy Minister, MK Litzman will – in practice – be Health Minister in every respect.
