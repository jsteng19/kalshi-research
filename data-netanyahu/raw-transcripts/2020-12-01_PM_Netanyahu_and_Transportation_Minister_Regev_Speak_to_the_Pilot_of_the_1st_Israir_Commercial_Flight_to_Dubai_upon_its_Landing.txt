Great congratulations – may you continue over and over." Minister Regev: "I would also like to thank you, Prime Minister, for the support and for the great efforts that were made yesterday as well, until the last moments, in order to allow the passage over Saudi Arabia and the possibility that there will be reciprocity in the flights to the UAE and Bahrain with the Emirati and Bahraini companies."
