Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his wife Sara and his sons Yair and Avner, tonight at Mt. Herzl Military Cemetery in Jerusalem, visited the grave of

Lt. Col. Jonathan (Yoni) Netanyahu

; the family marked the 35th anniversary of his fall during the operation – which he commanded – to free the hostages at Entebbe and lit a memorial candle.

The Netanyahu family decided to visit the grave one day before the beginning of Remembrance Day for the Fallen of Israel's Wars out of consideration for the bereaved families and the public that are expected to visit Mt. Herzl so that they would not be delayed by the heavy security around the Prime Minister.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said: "Every bereaved family must cope with the memories of their fallen loved ones throughout the year. On Remembrance Day, the entire nation shows solidarity in a moment of sadness and gratitude for those who gave their lives so that the State of Israel might live."

Lt.-Col. Netanyahu is considered one of the State of Israel's greatest fighters who was well chosen to lead one of the most daring operations in the history of the state. To this day the operation is studied in counter-terrorism schools and serves as an example of IDF soldiers' daring.

Two of his brothers – the Prime Minister and author-physician Ido Netanyahu – served in the same elite unit, the General Staff Reconnaissance Unit.
