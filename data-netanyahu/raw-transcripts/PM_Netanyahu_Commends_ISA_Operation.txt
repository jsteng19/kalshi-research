Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, at the ceremony to rededicate David Ben-Gurion's hut at Sde Boker, made the following remarks about the ISA operation:

"I would like to commend the ISA and the IDF for foiling very dangerous terrorist actions that could have claimed many victims in our country. This action was publicized but there are very many actions that remain secret, counter-terrorist actions against Hamas, which challenges the existence of the Jewish nation-state and, in effect, challenges the existence of Jews in general. We are operating day and night in order to maintain the security of Israel's citizens; the people who do this are deserving of all praise and support.
