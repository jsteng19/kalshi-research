Following are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks, this evening, in Jerusalem, at the start of the Security Cabinet meeting :

"For years, Iran has been acting against us both directly and via its proxies; therefore, Israel is acting against Iran and its proxies, defensively and offensively.

We will know how to defend ourselves and we will act according to the simple principle of whoever harms us or plans to harm us, we will harm them."
