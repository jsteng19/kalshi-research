Following the security assessment Prime Minister Netanyahu said:

"I have just finished an assessment with the heads of the IDF and the security establishment senior leadership. Israel views with utmost gravity the attacks against it on the fence, on the area adjacent to the Gaza Strip, on Be'er Sheva – everywhere.

I want to tell you today as well – Israel will take very strong action."
