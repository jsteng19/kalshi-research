Following is an excerpt from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks, at Tel Aviv University Cyber Week:

"We're encouraging international associations. Both government to government in cooperation on the questions of cybersecurity, a very complex issue. We have today cooperation first with our great and irreplaceable ally the United States of America. We cooperate in cybersecurity as never before and in many other fields of intelligence.

The way we protected against the hijacking of planes in the past was to put armed guards or have security forces ready to burst into hijacked planes. Later a whole industry that developed in Israel for mechanized locks on doors for pilots, separating the pilots and maintaining the security of the cockpit and so on. That's one way to deal with hijacking. It was not ineffective. It was good. It was effective but it's very expensive.

Here's another way. That plane leaving from Sydney to Abu Dhabi was going to be exploded in midair. And we found out through our cyber activities we found out that ISIS was going to do this so we alerted Australian police and they stopped this before it happened. That's a more effective way of doing this.

This particular incident leaked in the press so I can talk about it. If you multiply that 50 times, that will give you an idea of the contribution that Israel has made to prevent major terrorist operations, especially by ISIS in dozens of countries. And most of those cases were foiled because of our activities in cybersecurity.

This affects every country in the world. It affects every person in the world. It affects them not only in aviation and transportation, it affects them in everything. Israel has seized the opportunities and is meeting the dangers and we invite you to do the same with us in partnership."
