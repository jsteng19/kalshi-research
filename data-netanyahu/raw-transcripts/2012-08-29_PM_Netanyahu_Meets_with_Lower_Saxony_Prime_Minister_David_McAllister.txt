Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening met with the Prime Minister of the German State of Lower Saxony, David McAllister, who is visiting Israel.

At the start of the meeting, Prime Minister Netanyahu told his German colleague: "Seventy years ago, 6 million of my people were exterminated in an act of genocide. The world pledged 'never again'; it passed treaties against genocide; it formed the United Nations; it made a commitment that this thing will never be repeated. Today, over 120 countries are in Tehran, saluting a regime that not only denies the Holocaust but pledges to annihilate the Jewish state, brutalizes its own people, colludes in the murder of thousands of innocent Syrians and leads millions in chanting 'Death to America, death to Israel.' So many in the international community appear to have learned nothing. I think this is a disgrace and a stain on humanity. Iâ€™m glad that Germany is among those countries that refuse to take part in this charade and condemn us. Because our common future is bound on standing up and confronting this inhumanity and this brutality. So as part of our good relations, I welcome you to Israel."
