Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today eulogized

Lt. Assaf Ramon

"'Thy beauty, O Israel, upon thy high places is slain! How are the mighty fallen!'*

Few are the moments in which private pain so strongly shatters the national heart. Today, the entire nation is wrapped in unfathomable grief over the death of Assaf Ramon, who fell from the skies like his father

Ilan

This is an awful tragedy for Rona and the entire Ramon family; this is an awful tragedy for the entire people of Israel.

I was moved when Ilan, the youngest of the pilots who bombed the death reactor in Iraq, took with him into space a pencil drawing titled 'Moon Landscape' drawn by a 14-year-old Jewish boy, Peter Ginz, who was murdered at Auschwitz. I was also deeply moved when Assaf continued in his father's path and finished the IAF pilot's course with top marks. The loss of each of these outstanding individuals, father and son, is a disaster in and of itself. The loss of both brings with it pain too terrible to bear.

There is no consolation for the Ramon family, or for the Israeli people, only tears.
