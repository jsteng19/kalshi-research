As part of his visit to Tel Aviv today, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, along with Tel Aviv-Jaffa Mayor Ron Huldai and Education Minister Naftali Bennet, visited the HEMDA Schwartz-Reisman Science Education Center. The Prime Minister met with HEMDA Director Dr. Tehilla Ben-Gai, professional staff and students and told them: "The program here is very interesting and, in my view, important. We will replicate it. We will sit together and think about how we can replicate what is here in several other places around the country."

Prime Minister Netanyahu also referred to the 3-D printers: "This is the future of the manufacturing process and will bring about a major revolution. It will be possible to print bridges, cars, tables, shoes â€“ everything. This means that the advantage of size will be cancelled. Up until today in order to manufacture one needed many people. This is changing; today one needs machines. As a state, this could give us a considerable advantage."
