Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today at the Knesset, met with Italian Defense Minister Giampaolo Di Paola, and said:

“Relations between Italy and Israel are good and becoming stronger. We are cooperating on all possible levels. Your visit here to Israel is taking place at a time when the focus of attention is on the terrorist attacks being perpetrated by elements which are backed and financed by Iran.

Dozens of rockets are hitting Israel

. These terrorist attacks, by Islamic Jihad for example, underscore the magnitude of the danger that would be created if – Heaven forbid – a nuclear Iran would stand behind them. The world must be united in the face of the Iranian threat.”
