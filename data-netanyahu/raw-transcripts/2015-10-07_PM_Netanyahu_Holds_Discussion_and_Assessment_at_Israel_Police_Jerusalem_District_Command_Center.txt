Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the Israel Police Jerusalem District command center, held a discussion and assessment of the situation, along with Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan, Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee Chairman Tzachi Hanegbi, Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat, Israel Police Acting Commissioner Bentzi Sau and Israel Police Jerusalem District Commander Moshe Edri.

At the end of the discussion, Prime Minister Netanyahu said:

"Yesterday I was with the IDF; today I am with the Israel Police. I would like to commend its commanders, Bentzi Sau and Moshe Edri, and officers, including Border Police fighters. They are doing exceptional, courageous work, and are showing dedication and sacrifice. We are still in the midst of a wave of terrorism. We are taking strong action against the terrorists, rioters and inciters. We have boosted our forces and are using all necessary means and methods in the fight against this terrorism.

Civilians are at the forefront of the war against terrorism and must also be on maximum alert. I would like to praise the level-headedness that Israel's citizens have shown both in recent days and today, in Jerusalem and Kiryat Gat. The goal of terrorism is to sow fear and the first order in defeating terrorism is to be level-headed and resilient, both nationally and personally. We have known worse times than this and we will also overcome this wave of terrorism with determination, responsibility and unity."
