Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, visited an IDF Intelligence base. He was briefed by GOC Intelligence Maj.-Gen. Aviv Kochavi and spoke with soldiers. The Prime Minister thanked Maj.-Gen. Kochavi for the Intelligence Corps' contribution in Operation Protective Edge. "The information provided by the Intelligence Corps, under your leadership was an asset and constituted a significant part of the military blow to Hamas. It is clear to Hamas that we will not accept sporadic firing; therefore, it took care to make it clear that those who carried out the firing have been arrested and that it is committed to the ceasefire," the Prime Minister said.
