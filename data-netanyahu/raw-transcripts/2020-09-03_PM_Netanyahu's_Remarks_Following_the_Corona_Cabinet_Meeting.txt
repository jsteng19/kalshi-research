Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, following the meeting of the Corona Cabinet: "For an entire month, we had a high – even very high – but stable level of morbidity. In recent days there has been an increase, and a very dramatic increase yesterday. Today, in the Corona Cabinet, we decided to make an immediate effort to block this increase in morbidity. We made a decision to enact lockdowns on the red cities from which infection is spreading both within the cities themselves and to the rest of the population of Israel. I request the cooperation of every Israeli citizen in order to block this morbidity. It is important for the health of each and every one of you."
