The State of Israel appreciates and esteems

US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's warm remarks regarding the deep bond between the United States and Israel and the US commitment to Israel's security

Regarding the commitment to peace â€“ In the past year, the Government of Israel has proven its commitment to peace in both word and deed, including

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's 14.6.09 Bar-Ilan University speech

the dismantling of hundreds of checkpoints and roadblocks in Judea and Samaria

, and

the decision to suspend new construction starts in Judea and Samaria for ten months

, which Secy. of State Clinton defined as, "unprecedented."

By contrast, the Palestinians have raised preconditions for the resumption of the diplomatic process, such as they have not done in the past 16 years.

They are waging an assault to delegitimize Israel in international institutions via the Goldstone report

. They are also continuing to

incite towards hatred and violence

; included in this is

the decision to dedicate a square in Ramallah after the woman terrorist responsible for murdering 38 Israelis

Prime Minister Netanyahu again calls on the Palestinians to enter into the tent of peace without preconditions because this is the only way to reach an agreement that will ensure peace, security and prosperity for both peoples.
