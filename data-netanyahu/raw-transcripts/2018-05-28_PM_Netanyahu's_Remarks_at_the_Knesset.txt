Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the Knesset, made the following remarks:

"Next week I will leave for Europe. I will meet with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, with French President Emmanuel Macron and perhaps with British Prime Minister Theresa May as well.

I will discuss with them about blocking Iranian nuclear aspirations and Iranian expansion in the Middle East. I will present our positions as clearly as possible. We are already well experienced. For years we stood alone against these twin threats and I think that the situation has changed for the better. Of course I will present these matters as vital to the security of Israel.

Regarding Syria our position is clear: We believe that there is no room for any Iranian military presence anywhere in Syria. And of course, this reflects not only our position; I can say with certainty that it also reflects the positions of others in the Middle East and outside it. This will be the main focus of discussions there.

In France I will also represent Israel at celebrations marking 70 years of ramified cultural relations between Israel and France; there is much to celebrate."
