Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, last night, in New York, met with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic. Serbian Foreign Minister Marko Djuric also participated in the meeting.

Serbian President Vucic:

"I would like to raise one issue which is of the utmost importance for us. It’s the hostage issue and we would like to see those people freed as soon as possible. We have one Serbian citizen and we hope that if there are any chances to get these people back to their parents, to their kids, to their sisters and brothers, to their families, that would be very important for us."

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

The relations between Serbia and Israel are exceedingly good and getting better each day. But we both have a goal – to return all our hostages safely back to Israel, including Alon Ohel, who is held captive by the Hamas terrorists. It’s unconscionable. The family is suffering

I appreciate the fact that you have extended your government’s support for this. All civilized countries have to stand together to end this monstrosity. So I thank you for your friendship and your efforts on behalf of the hostages."

Prime Minister Netanyahu thanked President Vucic for Serbia's support of Israel and for the deep friendship between the peoples, as well as for the latter's personal involvement in efforts to free the hostages, including hostage Alon Ohel, who also has Serbian citizenship.

The two leaders expressed their common desire to expand bilateral cooperation in various areas, including their economies, security and trade.
