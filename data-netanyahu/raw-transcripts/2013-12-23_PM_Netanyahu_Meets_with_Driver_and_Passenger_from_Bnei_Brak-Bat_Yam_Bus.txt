Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, met with Michael Yoger, the driver of the #240 bus from Bnei Brak to Bat Yam, and with passenger David Papo, whose alertness thwarted a terrorist attack yesterday. "I commend you both for your alertness. I hope that you will not need it any more. Lessons must be learned from everything. The most important thing is to keep one's eyes open," the Prime Minister said.
