Following are Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks today at the Unto Every Person There is a Name ceremony at the Knesset, on the occasion of Holocaust Martyrs and Heroes Remembrance Day:

"In 1933, my father-in-law, the educator and prize-winning author, Shmuel Ben-Artzi, decided to realize his dream and immigrate to the Land of Israel in order to be a pioneer.

He did not accede to the entreaties of the members of his family, who asked him to remain in Bilgoraj, Poland. His entire close and extended families – except for a few members – were murdered, including in the death camps. His parents – my wife's grandfather Moshe Hahn and her grandmother Ita – and twin sister Yehudit were murdered; the latter was only 24.

When my father-in-law recalls his twin sister, his eyes brim with tears, his lips quiver and he cannot speak.

His brothers Meir (18), Shimon Tzvi (16) and Aryeh Leib (13), and sister Fisla (10), his aunt Matel, her son Hillel and her eldest daughter; his uncle Mendel, his wife and their two children; his uncle Abraham Tauber, his wife and their son and daughter; his aunt Hinda and her husband Yehezkel; his aunt Handel, her husband and their children; his aunt Pala and her two daughters; his aunt Rachel Tauber and her sons Avraham, Yaakov and Shlomo, and their wives and children; all perished, may their blood be avenged.

Shmuel Ben-Artzi has three sons and a daughter, thirteen grandchildren, and a growing number of great-grandchildren."
