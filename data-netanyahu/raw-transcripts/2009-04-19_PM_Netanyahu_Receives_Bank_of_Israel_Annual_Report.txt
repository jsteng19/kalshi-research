Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Bank of Israel Governor Prof. Stanley Fisher made the following remarks this morning, upon the presentation of the Bank of Israel's Annual Report - 2008:

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"I thank you, Governor Fisher. We are about to put forward solutions for expansion, to reduce unemployment and for economic prosperity that will last for many years.

We are in the midst of an economic crisis which is hitting us with unemployment and with economic contraction and I see that our Government's major mission, with your assistance, is to turn this trend around, to halt the increase in unemployment and to return the economy to expansion. We have some experience in that we succeeded in recent years in turning the Israeli economy around to five years of expansion, and we will have to repeat this success. And I am convinced that with joint efforts we will do so."

Bank of Israel Governor Fisher:

"I thank you and I also support the mission which you have described. The fact is that the Israeli economy is in relatively good condition, that is, much better than most of the states in the US, Europe and even some Asian countries.

We have the foundation for this and we must change the atmosphere in the economy. Its not that we do not have problems, but in my opinion we have the tendency to exaggerate a little in relation to problems and with the proper policies we will be able to extract ourselves relatively quickly. We can now see the first signs, at least in the financial markets. So there is a lot of work to do, there are many things which we much safeguard: Financial stability, fiscal discipline, etc., but we have the foundation to advance from here."
