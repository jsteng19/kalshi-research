Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today spoke with Dr. Yehuda David, who was acquitted (in France) today of a charge of slander against Jamal al-Dura, and told him, "You are an example in the struggle for truth in the State of Israel and in clinging to the justice of the path of our people. You have done great service for the Jewish People."

The Prime Minister added that on Sunday, 19.2.12, the Cabinet would support draft legislation according to which the state will pay Dr. David's legal fees. Dr. David thanked the Prime Minister and said that, "Today, the justice of the Jewish People has triumphed."
