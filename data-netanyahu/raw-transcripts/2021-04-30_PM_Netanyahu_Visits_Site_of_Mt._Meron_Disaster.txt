Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today , visited the site of the Mt. Meron disaster and was briefed at the site by Public Security Minister Amir Ohana, Israel Police Inspector General Kobi Shabtai and other officials.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"The Mt. Meron disaster is one of the worst disasters to hit the State of Israel. We grieve for the victims. Our hearts are with the families and with the wounded to whom we wish a full recovery.

There were heartbreaking scenes here. People were crushed to death, including children. Many of the victims have still not been identified and I would like to avoid the dissemination of rumors on social media because this breaks the families' hearts. Let the authorities work.

I must also point out that there was quick rescue work here by the police, the rescue and security forces, and we are profoundly grateful to them; they prevented a far worse disaster.

We will carry out a thorough, serious and in-depth investigation in order to ensure that such a disaster does not recur.

I would like to declare Sunday as a day of national mourning. Let us all join in the grief of the families and pray for the wellbeing of the injured."
