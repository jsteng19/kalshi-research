David Medan, Prime Minister Netanyahu's coordinator on the issue of Israel's POWs and MIAs, and his personal representative in the negotiations for the return of Gilad Shalit, has decided to resign from the Mossad and move to the private sector.

Medan served in the Mossad for approximately 35 years, in command and operational posts in Israel and abroad. At the Prime Minister's request, Medan will continue to deal with the POW and MIA issue and any other public matter as required.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said, "For myself and for the citizens of Israel, I thank David for the dedicated and important work that he has done, and will continue to do, on behalf of the return of Israel's POWs and MIAs."
