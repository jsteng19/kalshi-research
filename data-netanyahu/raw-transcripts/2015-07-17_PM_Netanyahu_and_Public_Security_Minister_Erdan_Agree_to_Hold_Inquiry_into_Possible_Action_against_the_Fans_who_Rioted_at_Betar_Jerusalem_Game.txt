Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, spoke with Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan. The two agreed that an inquiry will be made into possible action against the fans who rioted at last night's Betar Jerusalem game. "It is good that the decisive majority of Betar fans immediately condemned the behavior of that same small group. We will not allow them to besmirch an entire group of fans and harm the image of the state," the Prime Minister said.
