Following is an excerpt from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks, today , at the opening of the Knesset summer session and the special session in honor of US House of Representatives Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA).

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"The first and most urgent challenge is the joint effort by Israel and the US to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. The IDF and the US Armed Forces recently completed the largest military exercise in the history of Israel and for this I would like to thank the Biden administration.

We correctly view the threat emanating from the fanatic regime in Iran, which threatens not only Israel but also the US and the entire free world.

The need to block the nuclear arming of Iran will continue to be at the top of Israel's priorities during the Knesset summer session, as will our determination to confront Iran's regional proxies. We will not allow Iran to place a noose of terrorism around us â€“ not in Syria, not in Lebanon, not in Gaza, and not in Judea and Samaria.

We will not allow Iran to entrench itself militarily on our borders and we will do everything to prevent it from obtaining nuclear weapons."
