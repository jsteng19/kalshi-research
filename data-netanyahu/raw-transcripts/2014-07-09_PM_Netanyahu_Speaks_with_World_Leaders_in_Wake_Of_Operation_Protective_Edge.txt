Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and US Secretary of State John Kerry.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said in his conversations that no country in the world agree to suffer relentless missile attacks and infiltration attempts by sea and via tunnels . Hamas is perpetrating a double war crime by deliberately trying to attack Israeli civilians while using the civilian population in Gaza as human shields . Therefore, Hamas is responsible when civilians in Gaza are hit by mistake.

Prime Minister Netanyahu added that Hamas is known throughout the world as a terrorist organization and said that the international community must strongly condemn the continual firing by Hamas and the other terrorist organizations at Israeli cities.

Prime Minister Netanyahu is due to speak with additional world leaders in the coming days.
