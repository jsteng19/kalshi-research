Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening: "An opportunity such as this comes once in history and cannot be missed. Today, we have in the White House the greatest friend that Israel has ever had; therefore, we have the greatest opportunity that we have ever had. For three years, I have spoken with President Trump and his staff about our most vital national and security needs, which must be included in any diplomatic arrangement. I have found an attentive ear in the White House to these needs. Therefore, I am full of hope that we are on the verge of a historic moment in the annals of our state. I am leaving for Washington with a sense of great mission, of great responsibility and of great opportunity, which will not recur, to ensure the future of Israel."
