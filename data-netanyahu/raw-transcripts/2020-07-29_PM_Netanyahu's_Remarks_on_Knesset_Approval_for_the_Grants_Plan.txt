Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu:

"Just as I promised you, the Knesset has now approved the plan for a grant for every citizen that I initiated. The money will reach your bank accounts, citizens of Israel, by the beginning of next week. This is another step that will make things easier for you and will move the wheels of our economy.

We have taken many such steps worth many billions: The safety nets for businesses and wage-earners, extending the eligibility period for unemployment compensation, the unpaid leave and more, and there will be more, because we must and can defeat the coronavirus together."
