Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with Public Security Minister Yitzhak Aharonovitch and Israel Police Commissioner Insp.-Gen. Yohanan Danino regarding the disturbances that took place over Shabbat. He praised the police deployment and its determined action against the demonstrators. "We will treat offenders to the fullest extent of the law and will not tolerate such disturbances. We have – and will have – no tolerance for those who break the law. Attempts by a loud and violent minority to deny a better future to a large and broad population are grave. We will continue to advance the law (
