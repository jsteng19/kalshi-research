Following are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks at the start of his meeting today, with Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and the artists whose design has been selected

for the memorial to Red Army's victory over Nazi Germany

"During my talks here in Moscow,

missiles have fallen on Israeli cities

. I think that Russia understands that we are waging a determined war against terrorism. Prime Minister Putin expressed his deep solidarity, as did President Medvedev, for this struggle.

During my meeting with Prime Minister Putin, US President Barack Obama called and expressed his condolences over

the recent murder in Jerusalem

, and – of course – his solidarity, that the US stands with us, with Israel, in the struggle against terrorism.

I think that when the Prime Minister of Israel speaks with the Prime Minister of Russia and the President of the US, all are united against terrorism. I think that this strengthens our common stand against terrorism. This is a common goal for all civilized nations. This evening, I think that we received an important expression of this. We are working responsibly, and with strong determination, in order to halt the terrorist attacks. I am pleased to see that both Moscow and Washington appreciate our position.
