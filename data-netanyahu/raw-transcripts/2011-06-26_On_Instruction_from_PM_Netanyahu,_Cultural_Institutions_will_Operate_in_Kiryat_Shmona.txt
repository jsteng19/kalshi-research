The Cabinet today approved a solution to enable the continued operation of the community center, library and auditorium in Kiryat Shmona. This is in keeping with a solution that was formulated by the Prime Minister's Office, on instruction from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

According to the decision, NIS 6 million in Government assistance will be allocated for community centers in areas near the border and in towns under threat, which have become caught up in severe economic difficulties.

The proposal was formulated in cooperation with the ministries of Education, Finance, Interior, Negev and Galilee Development, and Culture and Sports.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said that, "As we promised, the Cabinet will, today, allocate the funds needed by cultural institutions, including the library, in Kiryat Shmona. I would like to thank Finance Minister Steinitz, Education Minister Gideon Saar, Minister Silvan Shalom, and Culture and Sports Minister Limor Livnat, all of whom acted in concert in order to resolve this issue."
