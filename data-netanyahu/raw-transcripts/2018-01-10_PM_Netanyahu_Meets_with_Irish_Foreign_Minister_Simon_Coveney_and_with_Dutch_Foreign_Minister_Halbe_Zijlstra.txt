Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this afternoon met with Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney and with Dutch Foreign Minister Halbe Zijlstra, and told them that Abu Mazen must condemn last night's reprehensible murder and stop financing murderers and their families.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said that herein lies the true root of the conflict â€“ the refusal to recognize the State of Israel within any borders whatsoever along with the encouragement of the murder of Israelis.
