PM Netanyahumade the following remarks upon leaving for Cyprus:

"I am now leaving for the periodic summit with the leaders of Cyprus and Greece. We will discuss a series of issues, first and most important of which will be advancing the feasibility of a regional gas pipeline from Israel to Cyprus, via Greece, to Europe. This will be of great economic significance for the State of Israel if it is built.

Of course I will also discuss regional issues with them especially the increasing aggression of Iran in our region."
