Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this morning, issued the following statement on the release of Jonathan Pollard:

"The people of Israel welcome the release of Jonathan Pollard. As someone who raised Jonathanâ€™s case for years with successive American presidents, I had long hoped this day would come. After three long and difficult decades, Jonathan has been reunited with his family. May this Sabbath bring him much joy and peace that will continue in the years and decades ahead."
