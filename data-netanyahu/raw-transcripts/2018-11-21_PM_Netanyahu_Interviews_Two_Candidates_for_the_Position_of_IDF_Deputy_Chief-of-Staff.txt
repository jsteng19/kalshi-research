Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu interviewed two candidates for the position of IDF Deputy Chief-of-Staff: Maj.-Gen. Eyal Zamir and Maj.-Gen. Nitzan Alon. The two were interviewed by IDF Chief-of-Staff-designate Maj.-Gen. Aviv Kochavi earlier this week.

A decision on the issue will be made in the coming days.
