Prime Minister Netanyahu, in light of the further increase in morbidity data, held a consultation with the participation of Health Minister Yuli Edelstein, Public Security Minister Amir Ohana and National Security Council (NSC) head Meir Ben-Shabbat. It was determined to take action to declare restricted zones – later today – where there is high morbidity. It was agreed that if the pace of morbidity continues, the issue of digital means would be submitted to the Cabinet before Sunday.
