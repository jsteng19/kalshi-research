Following is an excerpt from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks, this evening at the International Tanakh Quiz for Adults:

"Even though the Tanakh was written a long time ago, we – with our own hands – are writing the next chapters in the fascinating history of our people. This year's quiz centers on 'Love your neighbor as yourself and the other is me.' This not only includes accepting the convert and those who are different – children who are struggling with physical or mental disabilities are part of us. Each one of them, young and old, has a soul given to him by the Almighty and we, our people, understand and feel to the depths of our heart this human partnership, this partnership and unity before God. We must break down walls, lower barriers and attain – first and foremost – unity within our people."
