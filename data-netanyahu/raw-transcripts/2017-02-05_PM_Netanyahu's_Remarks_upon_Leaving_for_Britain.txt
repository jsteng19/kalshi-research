Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made the following remarks upon leaving for Britain where he will meet with British Prime Minister Theresa May:

"We are in a period of diplomatic opportunities and challenges. The opportunities stem from the fact that there is a new administration in Washington, and a new government in Britain. I intend to speak with both of them about tightening relations, between each side and Israel and trilaterally. This is what I will do next week in Washington and in London tomorrow. The challenges stem from the fact the Iranians also understand what I have just said. They are trying to test the boundaries with extraordinary aggression, gall and defiance. I think that the most important thing at the moment is that countries like the US, which will take the lead, Israel and the UK line up together against Iran's aggression and set clear limits to it. This will be the first issue, among many, that I will discuss with UK Prime Minister Theresa May and, of course, with Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.

About the regulation law, I am constantly hearing fake ultimatums. I am not bothered by this. There are people who are busy with empty briefings to the media and on social networks while I am busy with running the country. And as I run the country I think only about our overall national interest and act accordingly. If I have anything to tell you, you will know about it soon enough."
