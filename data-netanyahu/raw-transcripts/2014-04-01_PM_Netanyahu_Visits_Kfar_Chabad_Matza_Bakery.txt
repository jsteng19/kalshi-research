Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, visited the matza bakery in Kfar Chabad ahead of the upcoming Passover holiday. He noted, "At home, I have eaten this matza for years. Today, for the irst time, I am also preparing it myself. I am very excited. I wish thef entire Jewish People a Happy Passover."

Prime Minister Netanyahu [cited the Passover haggadah and] added, "In every generation enemies rise up to destroy us but G-d saves us from them. The haggadah mentions four sons – wise, wicked, simple and the one who does not know how to ask – but each one has a Jewish spark and you watch over this Jewish spark."

Local Chabad leaders and rabbis briefed Prime Minister Netanyahu on the preparations to hold Passover seders at the approximately 250 Chabad houses throughout Israel and the approximately 3,000 Chabad houses around the world. They told him that eating the matza expresses the belief that the Jewish People can withstand any pressure and asked that he continue to stand up for the freedom of the State of Israel.
