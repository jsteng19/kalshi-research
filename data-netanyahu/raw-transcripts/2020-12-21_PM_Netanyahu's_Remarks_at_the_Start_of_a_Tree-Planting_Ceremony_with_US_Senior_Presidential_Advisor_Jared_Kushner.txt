"I have just come from a Cabinet meeting. We have, at the moment, a new pandemic that is spreading, with a virus which we do not yet know about. This mutation could also be coronavirus 2. Therefore, I decided last night – and we implemented today – to close the skies of the State of Israel. Foreign nationals will not enter the country, other than exceptions such as diplomats. Israelis, who return from abroad, starting in another 48 hours, will be quarantined at designated hotels. If they return in the next 48 hours, they will be able to quarantine at home.

I know that this is a difficult decision but we have no choice. I understand the difficulty that is also being caused to families, travelers, to everybody. Nevertheless, this decision is critical because we must safeguard your health and your lives. This decision is valid, as of now, for ten days with the possibility of being extended.

We were exceptionally successful with the first coronavirus, on a global scale, both in taking control of the pandemic and in bringing millions of vaccines here. Just as we took control of the first virus, so too will we be successful in taking control of the second virus."
