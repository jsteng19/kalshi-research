Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has, this evening , accepted the principles of the National Security Council (NSC) proposal that was formulated with the assistance of a team of experts headed by Prof. Eli Waxman. The NSC proposal integrated and balanced between the Health, Finance, Economy and Industry, and Defense ministries.

Prime Minister Netanyahu decided on a responsible, cautious and gradual plan that includes a limited opening of businesses in a measured and controlled manner. The Finance Ministry will formulate a pilot plan for a number of commercial sectors that will be allowed to open subject to the directives of the Health Ministry. A standard will be determined that will include criteria for the opening of businesses in the defined sectors.

It will be permitted for up to two people to regularly venture out for sport or exercise up to 500 meters from home.

Special education on an individual basis will be permitted.

Over the next 48 hours, the professional teams will prepare the draft decision and map the sectors that will be included in the pilot, and detailed procedures for operating the businesses and companies will be prepared, as will be guidelines on the conduct of the public in both the public sphere and businesses. It is possible that changes will be made pursuant to the discussions that will be held over the next two days.

The decision will be submitted for Cabinet approval Saturday evening.
