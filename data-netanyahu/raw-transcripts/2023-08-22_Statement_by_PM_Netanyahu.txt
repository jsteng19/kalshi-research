Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today:

"The murder of the Director General of the city of Tira crossed a red line. We cannot tolerate these murders, the criminal organizations, the protection rackets and the taking over of the municipality.

We will use all means, including the ISA and the police, all means, in order to defeat this crime.

We have eliminated organized crime in the Jewish sector in Israel and we will eliminate organized crime in the Arab sector in Israel.

Every citizen of Israel must feel secure and not under the shadow of the threat of internal terrorism."
