Following is an excerpt from remarks Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made this evening at Ammunition Hill in Jerusalem, at the event marking 50 years since the liberation and unification of Jerusalem:

"Today, I would like to thank the Czech parliament for deciding to oppose UNESCO's non-recognition of Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem. The Czechs once gave us Czech rifles, this was the start of the struggle. This is also a sign of the opposing struggle to recognize a simple thing. The parliament in Prague called on its government to respect the status of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and also proposed halting any additional state payment of UNESCO membership dues as long as the organization continues the political discrimination against Israel. This is the correct, worthy and courageous decision that others should copy."
