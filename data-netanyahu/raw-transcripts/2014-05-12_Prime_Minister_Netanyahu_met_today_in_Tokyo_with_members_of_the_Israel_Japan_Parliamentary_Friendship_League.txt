Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today in Tokyo, met with members of the Israel Japan Parliamentary Friendship League led by MP Gen Nakatani.

At the start of the meeting Prime Minister Netanyahu said, "There is a common bond between us: We're both democratic, progress, technological societies. You face North Korea, which is a rogue regime with nuclear weapons. We face the possibility of Iran, which is a rogue regime that wants to have nuclear weapons. They're cooperating between them, and we should cooperate between us, and I want to commend you for keeping the torch of Israeli-Japanese friendship alive and now it's growing stronger. And it will grow stronger with this visit. I'm confident of that."
