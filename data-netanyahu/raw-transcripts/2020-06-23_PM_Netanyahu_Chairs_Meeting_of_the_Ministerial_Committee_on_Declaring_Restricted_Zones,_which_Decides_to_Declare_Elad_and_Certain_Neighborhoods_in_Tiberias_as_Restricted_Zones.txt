Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu chaired a meeting of the Ministerial Committee on Declaring Restricted Zones, which decided to declare Elad and certain neighborhoods in Tiberias as "restricted zones." The Health Ministry will distribute the full decision forthwith. The committee decided to declare the municipal area of Elad and the following neighborhoods in Tiberias – Ramat Tiberias Bet, Ramat Tiberias Gimmel, the 200 neighborhood, Tiberias Ilit and the Ben-Gurion neighborhood – as restricted zones. The declaration will be valid for seven days, from 08:00 on Thursday, 24 June 2020, until 08:00 on Wednesday, 1 July 2020. Prime Minister Netanyahu said after the discussion: "In wake of the increase in morbidity, the ministerial committee accepted the recommendation of the Health Ministry to impose restrictions on several neighborhoods in Tiberias, and the community of Elad. Tomorrow morning we will also consider other communities. The surest way to stop the pandemic is for all citizens to wear masks and maintain distance. In any case, tomorrow we will discuss other communities and we will announce our decisions accordingly."
