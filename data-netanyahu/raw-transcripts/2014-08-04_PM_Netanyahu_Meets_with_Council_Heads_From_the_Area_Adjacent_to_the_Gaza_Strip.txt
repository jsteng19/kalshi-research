Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon, GOC Southern Command Maj.-Gen. Sammy Turgeman, GOC Home Front Command Maj.-Gen. Eyal Eisenkot and Prime Minister's Office Director General Harel Locker, today (Monday, 4 August 2014), at IDF Southern Command, met with the mayor of Sderot and regional council chairmen from the area adjacent to the Gaza Strip and updated them on the results of the military actions during Operation Protective Edge, including action to neutralize terrorist tunnels. It was agreed that Prime Minister's Office Director General Locker would chair a team on the socio-economic development of the communities adjacent to the Gaza Strip in continuation of the area's demographic growth since 2009.

Prime Minister Netanyahu commended the leadership shown by the council heads throughout the operation.

Attending the meeting were Sha'ar Hanegev Regional Council Chairman Alon Schuster, Eshkol Regional Council Chairman Haim Yelin, Hof Ashkelon Regional Council Chairman Yair Ferjean, Sdot Negev Regional Council Tamir Idan and Sderot Mayor Alon Davidi.

At the start of the meeting, GOC Southern Command Maj.-Gen. Turgeman said, "The reality in the area adjacent to the Gaza Strip vis-Ã -vis the attack tunnels is completely different than that which prevailed before the start of Operation Protective Edge. Hamas has lost a strategic capability that it took years to build and which was destroyed within weeks."

Defense Minister Yaalon said, "The issue of lifting the threat from the tunnels that we know about is nearing completion. We will also increase security for communities adjacent to the Gaza Strip. We are committed to restoring security to residents and this goal needs to lead to a process of expansion and growth for communities in the area adjacent to the Gaza Strip."
