Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this evening in his Tel Aviv office, met with US Senator Joe Lieberman.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said: "We want to advance, in direct and serious negotiations, toward a framework agreement with the Palestinians, and at the same time promote a broader regional peace agreement with other countries in the Arab world. In order to do so, the current obstacle that the Palestinians have set must be overcome. It is not fundamental to the agreement itself because construction in Judea and Samaria will not affect the peace map.

It is important that we focus on the issues that genuinely important for achieving peace. As long as the Palestinians think that they have an option to go unilaterally to the UN Security Council they will avoid making serious progress in the direct talks. Therefore, the international community needs to make it clear to the Palestinians that direct negotiations are the only track for achieving a genuine and stable peace."
