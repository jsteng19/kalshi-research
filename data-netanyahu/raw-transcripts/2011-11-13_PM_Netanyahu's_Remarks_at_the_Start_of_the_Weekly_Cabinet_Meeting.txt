Following are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting today :

"Today, the Cabinet will receive a briefing on the IAEA report. This is a comprehensive document that strengthens the claims by leading countries in the world and Israel that Iran is systematically developing nuclear weapons.

Any responsible government in the world needs to draw the obvious conclusions from the

IAEA report

The international community must stop Iran's race to arm itself with nuclear weapons, a race that endangers the peace of the entire world.

Thank you."
