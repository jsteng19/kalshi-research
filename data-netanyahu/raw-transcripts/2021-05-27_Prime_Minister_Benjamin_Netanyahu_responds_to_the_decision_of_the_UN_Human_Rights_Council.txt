"Today's shameful decision is yet another example of the UN Human Rights Council's blatant anti-Israel obsession. Once again, an immoral automatic majority at the Council whitewashes a genocidal terrorist organization that deliberately targets Israeli civilians while turning Gaza's civilians into human shields.

This travesty makes a mockery of international law and encourages terrorists worldwide".
