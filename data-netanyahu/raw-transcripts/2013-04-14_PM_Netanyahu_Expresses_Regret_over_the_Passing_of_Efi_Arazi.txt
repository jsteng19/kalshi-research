Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, expressed his regret over the passing of Efi Arazi. "I was sorry to hear about Efi Arazi's passing. Efi Arazi was one of the pioneers of Israeli high-tech. He combined vision and action. He saw before many the vast technological potential of the State of Israel. I knew him â€“ a well-honed, brilliant man to whom the entire world was open. Unfortunately, his illness robbed from him and us the opportunity to continue contributing his genius to the progress and development of the Israeli economy," the Prime Minister said.
