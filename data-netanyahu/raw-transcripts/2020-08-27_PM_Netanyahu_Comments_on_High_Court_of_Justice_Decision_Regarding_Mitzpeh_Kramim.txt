"I regret the mistaken High Court of Justice decision on the evacuation of Mitzpeh Kramim. I have instructed Prime Minister's Office Director General Ronen Peretz to meet with representatives of the community. We will exhaust all processes in order to leave the residents in their place and we are convinced that we will succeed."
