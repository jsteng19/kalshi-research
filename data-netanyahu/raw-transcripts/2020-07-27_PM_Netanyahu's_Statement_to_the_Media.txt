Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening, at the Defense Ministry in Tel Aviv, issued the following statement: "Israel will continue to take action against Iran's efforts to entrench militarily in our region. Nasrallah is embroiling Lebanon â€“ because of Iran. Today, a Hezbollah cell infiltrated into Israeli territory. Thanks to the successful operational deployment of forces on the ground by its commanders, the IDF thwarted this attempt. We view the effort to infiltrate into our territory with utmost gravity. Hezbollah and Lebanon bear full responsibility for this incident and for any attack against the State of Israel emanating from Lebanese territory. Hezbollah needs to understand that it is playing with fire. Any attack against us will be met with great strength. Nasrallah already made a major mistake in underestimating Israel's determination to defend itself and Lebanon paid a heavy price for this. I suggest that he not repeat this mistake."
