Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, spoke with local council heads from southern and northern Israel. The Prime Minister explained that at this challenging time for our security, our enemies were mistaken by thinking that the citizens of Israel are not united behind the IDF. We are all united behind the security of the country and will do everything to ensure calm and security for us all. Prime Minister Netanyahu expressed his appreciation for the strong stand by the people in the area adjacent to the Gaza Strip and in communities in the north, and for the efforts of the council heads, while following the directives of IDF Home Front Command and the security agencies.
