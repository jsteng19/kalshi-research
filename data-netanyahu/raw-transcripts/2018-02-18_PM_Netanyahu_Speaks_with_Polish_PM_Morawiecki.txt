Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, spoke by telephone with Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki. He told him that the remarks that were made were unacceptable and that there was no basis for comparing the actions of Poles during the Holocaust to those of Jews.

Prime Minister Netanyahu pointed out that the goal of the Holocaust was to destroy the Jewish people and that all Jews were under sentence of death. He told his Polish counterpart that the distortion regarding Poland could not be corrected by means of another distortion.

The two agreed that the countries would continue their dialogue on the matter and that to this end the teams would hopefully meet soon.
