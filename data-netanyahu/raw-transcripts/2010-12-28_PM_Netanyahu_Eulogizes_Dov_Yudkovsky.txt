Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed his sorrow over the passing of journalist Dov Yudkovsky: "I received the news of Dov Yudkovsky's passing with sorrow and pain. He was among the most prominent Israeli journalists of recent generations. He turned Yediot Ahronot into a major force, exemplified fair, unbiased journalism and was a teacher and educator for generations of journalists, who were, and are, the foundation of the entire Israeli media. He crafted a journalism that reached out towards its readers, looked them in the eye and spoke their language. With his passing, an era in Israeli media has come to a close."
