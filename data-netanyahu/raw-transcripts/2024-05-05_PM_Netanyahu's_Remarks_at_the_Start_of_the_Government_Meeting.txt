Following are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks, today, at the start of the Government meeting: "After discussion by the Security Cabinet and pursuant to my directive, today the Government discussed closing Al Jazeera broadcasts in Israel. Al Jazeera correspondents have harmed the security of Israel and incited against IDF soldiers. The time has come to eject Hamas's mouthpiece from our country. I thank Communications Minister Shlomo Karhi for his activity on the issue. Today, the Government will discuss building a second hospital in Be'er Sheva. This is major news for the health of the citizens of Israel, especially in the south. The new hospital will include approximately 600 beds; it will combine the whole range of inpatient services and community care in the south of the country. I commend the Health Minister, the Finance Minister, their directors general and all of the partners in this historic move."
