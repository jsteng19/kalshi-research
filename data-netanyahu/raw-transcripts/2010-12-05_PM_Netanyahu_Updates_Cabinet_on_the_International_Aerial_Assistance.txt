Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this morning updated the Cabinet on the move he is leading regarding aerial assistance, from many countries around the world, in extinguishing the brushfire: "It must be understood that this is an entirely different kind of war. This is not dealing with regular fires; therefore, we must utilize various measures here which are different from those that are normally used."

GOC Air Force Maj.-Gen. Ido Nehushtan updated ministers on the use of the international aerial force, which has arrived from ten different countries. Thirty-five planes are in operation today, including 24 from abroad â€“ 3 large, 17 intermediate, 1 small, 11 sprayers and 3 helicopters. As of today, these aircraft have carried out 409 flights. The American "Supertanker", which can carry approximately 80,000 liters of water, has now gone into operation.
