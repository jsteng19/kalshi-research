At a discussion held last night, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu instructed the Defense Ministry – as per the recommendation of the National Security Council (NSC) – to formulate a national plan to deal with the needs of the elderly in Israel in light of the spread of the coronavirus.

The decision was made after a series of discussions led by the NSC that dealt with the elderly population and which evaluated policy regarding this population vis-à-vis the coronavirus.

It was agreed that the main food distribution centers around the country must be mapped and that available personnel must be linked with resources and needs, such as the channeling of assistance and personnel to where they are lacking.
