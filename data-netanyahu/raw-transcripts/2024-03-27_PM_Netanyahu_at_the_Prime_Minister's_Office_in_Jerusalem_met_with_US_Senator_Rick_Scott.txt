Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to US Sen. Rick Scott: "My decision not to send the delegation to Washington in the wake of that [UNSC] resolution was a message to Hamas: Don't bet on this pressure, it's not going to work."

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem, met with US Senator Rick Scott (R-FL) and thanked him for visiting Jerusalem and for his unwavering support for the State of Israel, especially at this time.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"I thought the US decision in the Security Council was a very, very bad move. The worst part about it was that it encouraged Hamas to take a hard line and to believe that international pressure will prevent Israel from freeing the hostages and destroying Hamas.

My decision not to send the delegation to Washington in the wake of that resolution was a message to Hamas: Don't bet on this pressure, it's not going to work.

I hope they got the message."
