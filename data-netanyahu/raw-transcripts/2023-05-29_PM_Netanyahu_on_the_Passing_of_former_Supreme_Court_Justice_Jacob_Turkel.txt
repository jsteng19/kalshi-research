Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this afternoon [translated from Hebrew]: "My wife Sara and I send our heartfelt condolences to the family of former Supreme Court Justice Jacob Turkel. Justice Turkel contributed greatly to the judicial system in Israel and to Israeli society. He was a man of deep integrity and great insight, and strongly loved the country. His determined struggle for the triumph of truth found expression, inter alia, in his refuting the mendacious attacks against the State of Israel. Justice Turkel's judicial legacy will continue to be a source of inspiration for years to come. His uncompromising commitment to the principles of justice and truth will continue to resonate among all those who cherish his memory. May his memory be blessed."
