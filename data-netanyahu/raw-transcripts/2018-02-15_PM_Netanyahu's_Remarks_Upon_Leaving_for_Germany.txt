Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today, at Ben-Gurion International Airport, made the following remarks prior to leaving for Germany:

"First I wish to send my deepest condolences to the families of the slain school children and teachers in the horrible massacre in Florida. I speak for the entire people of Israel when I say to the families and to the American people, our hearts are with you.

[Translated from Hebrew]

"I am leaving now for the most important security conference in the world – the Munich Security Conference. I will present proof of Iran's involvement in the recent events in the north and I will reiterate our determination to defend ourselves by ourselves – without any restrictions – against any threat."
