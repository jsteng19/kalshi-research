Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this afternoon, held a follow-up discussion on the implementation of the plan to strengthen security in Jerusalem. Among the participants were – inter alia – Public Security Minister Yitzhak Aharonovitch, Defense Minister Moshe Ya’alon, Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat, ISA Director Yoram Cohen, Israel Police Commissioner Insp.-Gen. Yohanan Danino and his deputy Nissim Mor, Jerusalem District Police Commander Moshe Edri and Deputy Attorney General Raz Nazeri.

At the discussion, the Prime Minister approved a plan formulated by Public Security Minister Aharonovitch and Israel Police Commissioner Insp.-Gen. Danino regarding a permanent increase of forces in Jerusalem. At this stage, it has been decided to add approximately 400 officers and additional technological means to the city area.

From data presented during the discussion, it was seen that Operation Guardians of the Walls on strengthening security in Jerusalem, which commenced this past October, has, so far, led to a decrease in events.

Prime Minister Netanyahu directed that units in the city continue on high alert and maintain their expanded deployment.
