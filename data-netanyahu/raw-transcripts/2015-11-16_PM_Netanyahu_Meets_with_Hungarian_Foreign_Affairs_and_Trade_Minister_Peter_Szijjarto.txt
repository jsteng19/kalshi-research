Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with Hungarian Foreign Affairs and Trade Minister Peter Szijjarto and thanked him for supporting Israel against the EU decision to label products from Judea, Samaria and the Golan Heights. "Thanks for the strong statement you made against labelling; it’s the right position and the moral position, and we appreciate it," the Prime Minister said.

During the meeting, Hungarian Foreign Affairs and Trade Minister Szijjarto expressed his opposition to the EU decision to label products. He updated Prime Minister Netanyahu on the major challenges facing Europe today including the mass migration from the Middle East into the heart of Europe. The two discussed the security needs of their respective countries in the face of the dramatic changes taking place in the Middle East and Europe.

The Hungarian minister gave the Prime Minister a gift – a soccer ball signed by one of the symbols of Hungary, noted soccer player Ferenc Puskas.
