Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this morning (Monday, 7 July 2014), spoke with Hussein Abu Khdeir, the father of Muhammad Abu Khdeir who was murdered last week.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said, "I would like to express my outrage and that of the citizens of Israel over the reprehensible murder of your son. We acted immediately to apprehend the murderers. We will bring them to trial and they will be dealt with to the fullest extent of the law. We denounce all brutal behavior; the murder of your son is abhorrent and cannot be countenanced by any human being."
