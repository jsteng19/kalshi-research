Following are Prime Minister Netanyahuâ€™s remarks at the start of the Cabinet meeting:

"We are in a close race between the vaccines operation and the surging morbidity in the world due to the mutations. Instead of lifting the lockdown as planned, many countries in Europe are now preparing to extend it until March or even April.

We must continue to make the right decisions for the citizens of Israel. We need to decide immediately about an additional extension of the existing lockdown. Perhaps this will not be popular and is uncomfortable during an election period but this is what we need to decide on today and I expect everyone to support it.

At the same time we are continuing the race to bring additional millions of vaccines to the country, which will afford us the possibility of overcoming the coronavirus, of emerging from it, of opening the economy and getting life back to routine.

True, it would be easier to ignore the major jump in morbidity and simply open everything but this would cost many lives. I am not there, I have never been there and I never will go there. What must guide everyone is saving lives and preventing the collapse of the health system, and no other considerations.

I know that this is a difficult decision for many citizens of Israel but what is required here is a final effort, a joint effort by all of us to emerge from the coronavirus and save lives.

I expect everyone to put life before everything and support the correct decision. I call on all citizens, even those who participated in the scandalous wedding yesterday in Bnei Brak, to stop violating the law. This is bloodshed. I call on the police to treat all lawbreakers, whoever they are, with an iron fist."
