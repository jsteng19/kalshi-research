Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today expresses his deep sorrow over the passing of Rabbi Yosef Shalom Elyashiv among the most important Torah leaders of our generation.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said the following:

"In his rulings, Rabbi Elyashiv made a deep impression on the ultra-orthodox world and on the entire Jewish People. In his teachings, he outlined a path for many, who drew their strength from his wisdom and his sharp thinking. Rabbi Elyashiv's way was to love the Torah and humanity, to be self-effacing and to maintain the sanctity of life.

Today, the Jewish People have lost a sharp and incisive rabbi, a wise man of great stature, an emissary who was faithful to the values of the Torah and who gave to others. We mourn his passing."
