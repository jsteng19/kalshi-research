Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem, met with US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Martin Dempsey and told him at the start of their meeting:

"You've been a wonderful friend and a grand champion of America and of America-Israel relations. We appreciate it. I want to take this opportunity to also express our respect and deep admiration for America's fighting men and women.

We know you're extended around the world, including in our region. We know we have no better friends than the American people, the American governments, the American fighting men and women. You fight for America, but you also fight for freedom."

General Dempsey said, "The greatest gift has been the friendship that we've managed to forge with the leaders in the IDF, and I know you're proud of them but we are too.

It's our constitution, and you know that that's what inspires us as I know service to your nation inspires you."
