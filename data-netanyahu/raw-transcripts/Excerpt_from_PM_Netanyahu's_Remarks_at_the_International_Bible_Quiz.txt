Following is an excerpt from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks today, at the International Bible Quiz:

"The Bible is not only the foundation of our existence, it is also the bellows that fans the flame of Zionism in everything that we do in the State of Israel today:The return to Zion, the ingathering of the exiles, the revival of the Hebrew language, standing steadfast against our enemies, creating a proper society, building up the Land of Israel in the hope for peace and the hope of a better future for all.

Everything is already in the Bible and, therefore, I say to these wonderful young people from outside Israel, Israel is home. It is the heart of our people. Come and join us, not just for the Quiz but permanently."
