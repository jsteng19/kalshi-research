Following are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks today at the meeting between the Israeli and Russian space agency delegations:

"Russian Ambassador Pyotr Stegny and members of the Russian delegation,

Russian Federal Space Agency

Head Anatoly Perminov and Science and Technology Minister Daniel Hershovitz, greetings.

I had excellent talks in Moscow with both

President Dmitry Medvedev

and

Prime Minister Vladimir Putin

. In my talks with the latter, we agreed to increase cooperation in space, which now finds practical expression in the signing of this agreement. What Minister Hershkovitz said is the truth. One year ago, I told him that I thought that Israel's most natural partner for cooperation is Russia, which has a major infrastructure for space operations.

We have focused technology, including – I believe – six satellites in space

. Soon we will have a dozen.

The technology is very focused and very advanced; therefore, the combination of Russia's major and developed industry, including its technology, and Israel's developed and advanced technology, is, I believe, one that could provide major benefits to both countries.

Moreover, this genuinely reflects the impressive development of our bilateral relations, the first two decades of which we are celebrating."
