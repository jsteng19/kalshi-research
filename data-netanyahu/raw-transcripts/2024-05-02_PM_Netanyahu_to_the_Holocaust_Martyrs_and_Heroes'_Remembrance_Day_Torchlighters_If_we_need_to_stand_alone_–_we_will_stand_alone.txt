Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara, today, at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem, met with the Holocaust survivors who will serve as the torchlighters (https://www.yadvashem.org/remembrance/archive/torchlighters.html?id=4332) at the opening ceremony for Holocaust Martyrs' and Heroes' Remembrance Day at Yad Vashem in Jerusalem.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"Izi (Itzhak Kabilio, one of the survivors) said here: 'The State of Israel is the one and only sanctuary of the Jewish people.' This is so correct, and Michael (Michel Bar-On, one of the survivors) said: 'We cannot rely on the nations of the world who make promises.'

If it is possible to receive the assistance of the nations of the world, I am always for it. However, in the greatest Holocaust, great leaders like Roosevelt, who was told what was happening at Auschwitz and Birkenau and in the [other] death camps, they told him and he knew, his answer was that he would not lose a single pilot and refused to accept the Jews. They were great leaders. Churchill, who I greatly admire, tried to recruit his army but his army rebelled against him.

If we need to stand alone – we will stand alone. If it is possible to recruit the nations of the world, how much the better. But if we do not defend ourselves – nobody will defend us.

The strength at our disposal is the strength that I have heard here, we have no other."
