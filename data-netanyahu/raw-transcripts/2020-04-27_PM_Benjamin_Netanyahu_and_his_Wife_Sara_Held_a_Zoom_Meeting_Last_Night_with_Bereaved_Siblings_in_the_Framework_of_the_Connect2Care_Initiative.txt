Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara, last night (Sunday, 26 April), held a Zoom meeting with bereaved siblings Eliasaf Peretz, who lost his brothers Uriel and Eliraz, Ayelet Gomez, who lost her brother Daniel, and Neta Baloa, who lost her brother Nadav, in the framework of the Connect2Care initiative.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"I will let you in on a secret. I devote time to this every day and there is no day when this does not happen and that I do not think about my brother Yoni. I remember him. I think about what he would say or do. Everyone who is in this circle, we are in the exact same circle and we must draw strength from it, not despair but strength. This is not easy because at the beginning there is only despair and gradually it can turn into strength and much hope."

The siblings told about their memories of their brothers, the moment when they were informed of the loss and how they cope with the bereavement. Eliasaf Peretz said that this year, with the coronavirus restrictions, his family 'was spared' the severe dilemma of deciding which grave they would visit first on Remembrance Day. Neta Baloa shared her childhood memories of her brother and said that Nadav serves her as a guidepost in life. Ayelet Gomez told about the moment when she learned about the loss of her brother and woke up her parents to give them the bitter news, and also shared the longing that that has accompanied her over the years.
