Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today, instructed the National Infrastructures Ministry, the Finance Ministry, the

Water Authority

, and

Mekorot

to submit to the Cabinet – within 30 days – an efficient and cost-effective solution on building a water desalination plant in Ashdod.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said: "It is inconceivable that the desalination plant, which is due to be advanced by Mekorot, has been stuck for years due to bureaucracy. It cannot be that the price which the public will pay for water will be inflated. I have proven in the past, as Prime Minister and Finance Minister, that – via fair and healthy competition – it is possible to cut bureaucracy and reduce consumer prices. I ask that the National Infrastructures Ministry, the Finance Ministry and Mekorot submit to the Cabinet – within 30 days – a proposal to quickly and efficiently advance the construction of the Ashdod desalination plant at a cost that reflects market prices."

Prime Minister Netanyahu instructed all parties to defend the public interest so as to maintain a fair consumer price, at a level that reflects competitive market prices and which allows the project to get underway as soon as possible, and maintains the strength of Mekorot. To these ends, he directed that a proposal be submitted within 30 days.

Prime Minister Netanyahu added: "Decisions regarding this desalination plant seem to me to be incorrect. It is clear that they have been stuck for years and that they do not reflect the public intertest. The direct way is the quickest way. Saving the water economy is critical; therefore, we will move forward on the issue with utmost seriousness so that the public may enjoy desalinated water as soon as possible, at a good price."
