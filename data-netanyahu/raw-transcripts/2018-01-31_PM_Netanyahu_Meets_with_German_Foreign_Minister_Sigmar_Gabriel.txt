PM Netanyahu met with German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel and told him:

"It's always an opportunity to speak to members of the German government. I just did this in Davos; I had an excellent conversation with Angela Merkel.

We just discussed the region and our bilateral relations. They are strong. I appreciate Germany's commitment to Israel's security. We discussed the efforts in stabilizing the region which is made more difficult by Iran's aggression in Syria and in Lebanon, and our common quest for peace, and resuming some kind of peace process with the Palestinians.

I want to thank you for Germany's commitment to Israel's security which you repeated in our conversation, and welcome to Jerusalem."
