Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today: "I would like to send deep, heartfelt condolences for myself and on behalf of the citizens of Israel to the family of French MP and former minister Claude Goasguen who passed away after falling ill with corona. Claude was a wonderful friend of the State of Israel who bravely fought against anti-Zionism. He supported us even in the most difficult moments. I mourn the passing of a great friend of our people and a personal friend of mine. We will remember him always."
