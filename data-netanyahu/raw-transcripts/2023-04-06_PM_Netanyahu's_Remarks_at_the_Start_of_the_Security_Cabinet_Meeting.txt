Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, at the start of the Security Cabinet meeting, made the following remarks:

"Recently, I have made it clear that our enemies should not misjudge us: The internal debate in Israel will not prevent us from taking action against them wherever and whenever necessary. All of us, without exception, are united on this.

We have no intention of changing the status quo on the Temple Mount. We are calling for calming the situation and we will take strong action against extremists who use violence there.

Regarding the aggression against us on other fronts, we will strike our enemies and they will pay the price for any act of aggression.

Our enemies will discover, again, that at moments of truth, the citizens of Israel stand united and unified, and back the actions of the IDF and the other security services to defend our country and our people."
