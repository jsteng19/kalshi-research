Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, in Moscow, made the following remarks after his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin:

"I just finished in-depth and good talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. I told him that Israel views two developments with utmost gravity: First is Iran's efforts to establish a military presence in Syria and second is Iran's attempt to manufacture – in Lebanon – precision weapons against the State of Israel. I made it clear to him that we will not agree to either one of these developments and will act according to need."
