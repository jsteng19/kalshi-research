Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today at the swearing-in of Aharon Franco as Israel Prison Service Commissioner, commented on

the arrest of the murderers who perpetrated the 11.3.11 terrorist attack in Itamar

"I was updated in recent weeks and days on the progress of the investigation. I must commend all of the security personnel who sought to ensure that their findings were complete. This considerable effort expresses our commitment to justice. For the family, this is not a complete answer but without it they could not be given even a partial answer. That the state made a commitment and kept it attests to the fact that we could not ignore such murders. We will reach murderers anywhere. This expresses our commitment to the idea that justice and security are with us."
