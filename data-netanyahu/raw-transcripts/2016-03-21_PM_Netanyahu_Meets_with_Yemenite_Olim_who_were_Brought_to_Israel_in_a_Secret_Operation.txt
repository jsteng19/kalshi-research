Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with Yemenite olim who arrived in Israel last night in a secret Jewish Agency operation.

The olim brought with them an 800-year-old Torah scroll. Prime Minister Netanyahu and one of the children read from the Torah scroll together.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"Welcome to Jerusalem, to the Land of Israel. I am very excited to see you here. It is moving that you know to read from the Torah. This is the basis. For many years we have thought about bringing you and with G-d's help it is over."

The olim were very moved and thanked the Prime Minister warmly and blessed him for Israel bringing them here.
