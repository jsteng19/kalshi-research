Nicholson: Thank you very much. Well, thank you very much, Prime Minister. I am delighted to be here. This is my first trip to Israel here, and of course I'm here to demonstrate emphatically Canada's unwavering support for Israel. Prime Minister Harper has made this very clear that we recognize Israel as a friend, a nation which shares core values and a beacon of democracy in a region of repression and instability.

We understand that Israel's neighborhood is as dangerous as Canada's is peaceful. And so we know that Israel's leadership has no choice but to take at all times every step necessary to protect itself from the forces that are openly committed to its destruction.

So we've long refused to be neutral in supporting Israel's right to defend itself against violent extremists. Israel is on the frontline of free and democratic the nations world over, just as you've pointed out, Prime Minister, and any who turn their back on Israel or turn a blind eye to the nature of Israel's enemies do so in the long run at their own peril.

With that in mind, I look forward to discussing the critical security issues, all the issues that confront us, but as well to reinforce that wonderful friendship that exists between our two countries. It's extremely valuable to us and we appreciate your friendship and your support.
