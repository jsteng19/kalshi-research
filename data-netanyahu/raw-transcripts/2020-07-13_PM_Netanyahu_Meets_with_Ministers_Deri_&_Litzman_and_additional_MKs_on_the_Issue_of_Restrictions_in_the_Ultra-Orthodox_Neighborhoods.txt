Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this morning, met with Minister Deri, Minister Litzman and additional MKs on the issue of the restrictions in the ultra-orthodox neighborhoods. The Health and Public Security ministers also attended the meeting. Health Ministry Director General Prof. Chezy Levy briefed participants on morbidity data in the neighborhoods upon which closures have been imposed. It was agreed that before closures are imposed, representatives of the ultra-orthodox public would be consulted and updated and that, to the extent possible, command centers would be opened in the communities themselves. Prime Minister Netanyahu: “I asked to meet here in order to hear from you and so that we could answer the distress, which I know is genuine and which touches our hearts. We want to help; nobody wants to harass, the opposite is true and I am open to listen.” Health Minister Yuli Edelstein, Public Security Minister Amir Ohana, Health Ministry Director General Prof. Chezy Levy, National Security Council Counter-Terrorism and Home Front Branch head Yigal Slovik and retired Israel Police Maj.-Gen. Arik Yekuel also attended the meeting.
