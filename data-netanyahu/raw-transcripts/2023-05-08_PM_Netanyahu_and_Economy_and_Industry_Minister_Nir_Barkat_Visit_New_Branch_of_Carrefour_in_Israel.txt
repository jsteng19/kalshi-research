Prime Minister Netanyahu: "This is great news for the citizens of Israel. Israel is opening up to one of the largest food concerns in the world. The Israeli consumer will enjoy lower prices." Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Economy and Industry Minister Nir Barkat, this evening, visited a new branch of the Carrefour international supermarket chain, which will be launched in Israel tomorrow. Prime Minister Netanyahu: "The entry of the first international retail chain to Israel is gigantic news for the citizens of Israel regarding competition and the lowering of prices. Together with Economy Minister Nir Barkat, we have approved the entry of the European standard. Citizens of Israel, what is good for Europe is also good for Israel. This means that prices will be dropping. They will drop by dozens of percent on hundreds of products, and on thousands in the future. This is news for the supermarket cart of every Israeli citizen who, once a week, spends thousands of shekels on a supermarket cart. But now, think about the hundreds of shekels that will be saved every week, meaning that thousands of shekels will be saved yearly off the prices you pay in the supermarket. This is the start of a change, which began when we enacted free education from ages 0-3. Together we are fighting the cost-of-living and increasing competition for the benefit of the citizens of Israel." Electra Consumer Products CEO Zvika Schwimmer and Carrefour Israel CEO Uri KIlstein also attended the event.
