Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today (Friday), 2.10.09, in his Jerusalem office, viewed the footage of Gilad Shalit and spoke by telephone with Noam Shalit. The Prime Minister believes that the footage is important because it verifies Gilad Shalit's situation and determines that Hamas is absolutely responsible for his health and well-being. Prime Minister Netanyahu wished the Shalit family a happy Sukkot and said that even though the path to Gilad's release is still long and arduous, the knowledge that he is well and in good health encourages us all.
