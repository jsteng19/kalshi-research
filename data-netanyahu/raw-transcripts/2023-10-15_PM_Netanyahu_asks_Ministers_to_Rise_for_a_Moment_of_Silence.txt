Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, at the start of the Cabinet meeting, asked ministers to rise for a moment of silence in memory of our brothers and sisters who were murdered in cold blood and for our heroic soldiers who fell in battle.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"This is the first meeting of the national emergency government, to which five additional ministers have joined – Benny, Gadi, Chili, Gideon and Yifat.

We are working around the clock, as a team and a united front. The unity among us gives a clear message to the nation, the enemy and the world.

I have seen our amazing soldiers who are now on the front line. They know that the entire nation is behind them. They understand the scope of the mission. They are ready to take action at any time in order to defeat the bloodthirsty monsters who have risen against us to destroy us.

Hamas thought that we would come apart – we will dismantle Hamas."

At the start of the meeting, the ministers received a security briefing on the situation by the Head of IDF Operations, Maj.-Gen. Oded Basiuk.
