That's why I think it's important for me to speak before the members of Congress, all members of Congress, and explain Israel's position. Now there are those who think otherwise.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this morning at his Jerusalem office, met with US Rep. Robert Pittenger (R-NC) and US Rep. Dennis A. Ross (R-FL) and told them at the start of their meeting:

"The American-Israeli alliance is a powerful one. It's based on common values, common interests. It's a bipartisan relationship. We appreciate the support of Democrats and Republicans alike. We have a great national interest in preventing Iran from acquiring the means to develop nuclear weapons. We believe this isn't a partisan issue. It isn't a Democratic issue; it's not a Republican issue. It's an Israeli issue. It's an American issue. It's a global issue and we believe that the current proposal before Iran, handed over by the P5+1 is very dangerous to Israel and dangerous to the region and the peace of the world.
