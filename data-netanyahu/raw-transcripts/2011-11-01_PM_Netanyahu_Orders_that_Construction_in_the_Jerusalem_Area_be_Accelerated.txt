Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today directed that the construction of apartments in Jerusalem, in the Etzion Bloc and in Maaleh Adumim, be accelerated. These are thousands of residential units, in areas that will, under any future agreement, remain part of Israel.

The foregoing directive was issued at the end of the first discussion by the forum of eight ministers; the next will discuss future steps.
