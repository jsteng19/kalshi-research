Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tomorrow is due to submit the law on national housing committees for its first Knesset reading. This is after the Ministerial Committee on Legislation approved the wording of the law.

According to the draft law, six committees will be established to accelerate construction. The purpose of the law is to hasten planning and construction in order to increase the supply of housing on the market and deal with the housing crisis in Israel. The committees will constitute a rapid track for approving public plans for housing only and will be operated by a professional team.

The draft legislation provides that the committees will be established for 18 months. Their goal is to reduce the shortage of approximately 80,000-100,000 apartments on the market, with only approximately 35,000 apartments being built per annum.

Prime Minister Netanyahu has instructed ministers to hasten the legislation as much as possible.
