Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today instructed the members of the committee on increasing competition in the economy to accelerate and complete the formulation of their recommendations by the end of the coming month.

Prime Minister Netanyahu noted that he established the committee – chaired by Prime Minister's Office Director-General Eyal Gabai and Finance Ministry Director-General Haim Shani – approximately ten months ago and asked it to examine existing distortions in the economy and recommend ways to solve the problems that are hindering economic activity.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said that the committee on increasing competition in the economy must act to increase competitiveness and lower prices.
