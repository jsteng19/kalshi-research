After conducting in-depth interviews with seven worthy candidates, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu decided to appoint former Israel Navy Commander, Vice-Admiral Eli Sharvit as the next Director of the ISA.

Vice-Admiral Sharvit served in the IDF for 36 years, including five years as Commander of the Israel Navy. In that position, he led the force building of the maritime defense of the territorial waters and conducted complex operations against Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran.

The ISA is a meritorious agency that underwent a severe upheaval on October 7.

Prime Minister Netanyahu is convinced that Vice-Admiral Sharvit is the appropriate person to lead the ISA in such a way that will continue its glorious tradition.
