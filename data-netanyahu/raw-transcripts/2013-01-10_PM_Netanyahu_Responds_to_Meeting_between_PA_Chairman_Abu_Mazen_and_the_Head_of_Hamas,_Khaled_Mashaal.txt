Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today responded to the meeting between Palestinian Authority Chairman Abu Mazen and the head of Hamas, Khaled Mashaal:

"Abu Mazen embraces the head of a terrorist organization that declared only last month that Israel must be wiped off the map. This is not how someone who wants peace behaves."
