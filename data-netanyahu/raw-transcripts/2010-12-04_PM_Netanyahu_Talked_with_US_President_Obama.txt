US President Barack Obama phoned Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu yesterday evening to convey his condolences to the families who lost their loved ones in the blaze and expressed his support for the citizens of Israel. President Obama said that he has made providing urgent assistance to Israel a top priority and that he has instructed government bodies to make arrangements to transfer the necessary resources.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said that it is impossible to know how long the fire will last, and therefore assistance, even though it may take time, is extremely important. The Prime Minister thanked the President personally and for the entire country for Americas readiness to help and for the substansial assistance that the US Government has already provided and on its intention to provide additional aid.
