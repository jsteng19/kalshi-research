Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, welcomed the countries that, today, declared Hezbollah to be a terrorist organization, in the context of the regional anti-terrorism conference currently being held in the Colombian capital of Bogota. In recent months, Prime Minister Netanyahu – together with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and additional elements – has led an effort vis-à-vis various countries in Latin America. The Prime Minister raised the issue in his meetings in recent months with many leaders. The Director of the National Security Council, the Foreign Ministry and the defense establishment also worked on the effort. The countries acceding to the recognition of Hezbollah as a terrorist organization are Colombia and Honduras; this is in addition to Argentina and Paraguay, which have already done so. In the context of the recognition, Colombia has adopted the full US terrorist list, which includes the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, Hamas and Islamic Jihad. Prime Minister Netanyahu: "I commend the countries that today joined Israel and the US in our struggle against global terrorism. This is an important step. I call on additional countries to join this move."
