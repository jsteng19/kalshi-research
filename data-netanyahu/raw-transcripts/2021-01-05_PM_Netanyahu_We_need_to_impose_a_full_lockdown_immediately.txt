Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"We are in the midst of a global pandemic that is spreading at top speed with the British mutation. It has reached Israel and is claiming many lives.

We need to impose a full lockdown immediately. We are in a Cabinet meeting and I have no doubt that the Cabinet will approve this and that the Knesset needs to pass it immediately.

Every hour that we delay, the disease spreads even quicker and it is exacting a heavy price. Therefore, we need here not only the cooperation of the Cabinet ministers, and we have it, we need the cooperation of the citizens of Israel and I am certain that we have that also.

We need the Knesset to pass this without delay, immediately. This is the saving of lives, nothing less."
