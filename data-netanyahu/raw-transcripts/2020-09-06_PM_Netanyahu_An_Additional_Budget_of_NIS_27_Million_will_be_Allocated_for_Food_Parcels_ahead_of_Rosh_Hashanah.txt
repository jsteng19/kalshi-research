Prime Minister Netanyahu, Finance Minister Yisrael Katz and Labor, Social Affairs and Social Services Minister Itzik Shmuli, at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem, met with representatives of non-profit associations that distribute food to the needy Prime Minister Netanyahu announced that he has decided to increase threefold, to NIS 18 million, the financial support for non-profit associations and roof organizations that distribute food parcels on a regular basis, and to allocate a budget of NIS 9 million for food parcels for Rosh Hashanah. An additional budget worth NIS 27 million will thus be allocated for food parcels for 2020. Prime Minister Netanyahu at the end of the discussion: "We are investing almost NIS 1 billion in immediate assistance for sectors in distress; we want it to reach them, and reach them quickly. For the holiday itself, while I was pleased to hear that the Finance Minister is proposing 2.5 times as much, it cannot be that the Prime Minister will not add something. Therefore, we will increase our assistance for the holiday by three times as much. This is important and it is also underscores our commitment to help families in need to celebrate the holidays with holiday meals, so that they should not go hungry, and so that they should know that all Israel is responsible one for the other. This is important. So, I thank you, and we will continue these meetings; this is important." Also attending the meeting were – inter alia – the head of staff in the Prime Minister's bureau Asher Hayon, Prime Minister's Office Acting Director General Ronen Peretz, Chairman and founder of Latet Gilles Darmon, Latet Executive Director Eran Weintrob, Yad Eliezer Assistant Director Eli Yaakobi, Pitchon-Lev Director Eli Cohen, Migdal Ohr Director Shai Amir and Chasdei Naomi project manager Tshuva Cavra.
