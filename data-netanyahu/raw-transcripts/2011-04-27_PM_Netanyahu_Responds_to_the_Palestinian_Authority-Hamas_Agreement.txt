Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this evening referred to the anticipated agreement between the Palestinian Authority and Hamas:

"The Palestinian Authority needs to choose between peace with Israel and peace with Hamas. Peace with both is impossible because Hamas aspires to destroy the State of Israel

and says so openly

It fires missiles at our cities

it fires anti-tank rockets at our children

I think that the very idea of this reconciliation shows the weakness of the Palestinian Authority and causes one to wonder if Hamas will seize control of Judea and Samaria like it seized control of the Gaza Strip.

I hope that the Palestinian Authority chooses correctly, i.e. that it chooses peace with Israel. The choice is in its hands."
