Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, commented as follows on the exercise deployment of the US THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense) anti-missile system in Israel:

"Deployment of the American anti-missile system in Israel is additional testimony to the commitment of the US to the security of Israel.

The American THAAD system is considered one of the most advanced systems in the world, and together with our defensive systems we are even stronger in order to deal with near and distant threats from throughout the Middle East.

The bond between the US and Israel has never been stronger. I welcome the holding of this joint exercise."
