Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau:

"Indeed it would be a pleasure to return to Israel when it works out, but in general this is really about starting and continuing… starting a conversation to continue the very strong friendship and relationship between Canada and Israel. We have many issues to talk about, to discuss, but also many issues to collaborate on, and I look forward to continuing the strong friendship that Canada has shown towards Israel for decades, and will continue for ongoing times."

Prime Minister Netanyahu also met with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and invited him to make an official visit as well.

The meetings were warm and friendly; the war on global terrorism was among the issues discussed.

"I’m delighted to see Prime Minister Trudeau. We’ve had a chance to speak on the telephone. Canada and Israel have had superb relations. There’s a foundation there to make these relations even stronger. Very practical things that are of interest to both our peoples, and I look forward to having that conversation with you. Now I’m inviting you to Israel at your earliest opportunity."
