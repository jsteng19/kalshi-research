"What happened today in Cairo is a tremendous blow to peace and a great victory for terrorism. Three days ago, terrorism was dealt a resounding defeat with the elimination of Osama bin Laden. Today, in Cairo, it had a victory." In signing this deal, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas had "embraced" an organization that had condemned the American operation against the al-Qaida leader and called him a "great martyr," Netanyahu said. "When he embraces this organization, which is committed to Israel's destruction and fires rockets on our cities, this is a tremendous setback for peace and a great advancement for terror. What we hope will happen is that we find peace, and the only way we can make peace is with our neighbors who want peace. Those who want to eliminate us, those who practice terror, are not partners for peace."
