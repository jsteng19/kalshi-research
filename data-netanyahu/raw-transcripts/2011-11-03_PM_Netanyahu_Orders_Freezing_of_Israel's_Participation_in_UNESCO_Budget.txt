Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today, ordered that Israel's $2 million-per-annum participation in the budget of UNESCO be frozen,

following the organization's decision to accept the Palestinian Authority into its ranks.

The Prime Minister ordered that the budget be directed to cooperative initiatives towards the same goals in the region.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said that, "Such steps will not advance peace; they will only push it further away. The only way to reach peace is through direct negotiations without preconditions."
