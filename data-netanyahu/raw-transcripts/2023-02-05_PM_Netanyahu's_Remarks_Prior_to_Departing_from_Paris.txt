Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, late last night, made the following remarks prior to departing from Paris: "In recent weeks, we have witnessed a growing wave of daily incitement, that crosses boundaries. It had seemed that all boundaries have been crossed by threats against elected officials and myself, but it seems that this is not the case because today we have heard and seen an explicit threat to murder the Prime Minister of Israel. I know that there is a debate over what endangers democracy but this is not something that is subject to dispute – this truly endangers democracy. I expect the law enforcement and security officials, who spoke out so clearly and sharply, during the tenure of the previous government, about phenomena that were much less serious, to come out – with the same severity and clarity – against this terrible phenomenon. I expect the law enforcement officials to take immediate action against those who are inciting to murder, and I expect the leaders of the opposition to speak out as vigorously and as strongly as I did. Ours is a complicated time and we need to do what is expected of us as public leaders. We cannot be silent about this."
