The Security Cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, convened this evening, in the framework of the 'Firm Hand' military exercise, at the IDF command center at the Kirya in Tel Aviv.

Prime Minister Netanyahu at the start of the simulated Security Cabinet meeting [translated from Hebrew]:

"The reality in our region is changing rapidly. We are not stagnating. We are adapting our combat doctrine and our possibilities for action in keeping with these changes and our goals, which are not changing.

We are committed to acting against the Iranian nuclear program, against missile attacks on the State of Israel and against the possibility of the fronts becoming linked, what we call a multi-front campaign. This requires us to evaluate, if it is possible to do so in advance, many of the main decisions that the Security Cabinet and the Government would need to make together with the security establishment, the IDF and other security elements.

This is the goal of the exercise. We are certain that we can deal with every threat by ourselves, and also by other means."

Prime Minister Netanyahu and the Security Cabinet ministers, together with the IDF, are taking part in the 'Firm Hand' exercise that simulates ramified fighting. The exercise tests the ability of the IDF to fight on several fronts simultaneously, under various scenarios, with an emphasis on the northern sector.

The goal of the exercise is to raise the fitness of the IDF and its preparedness for a prolonged campaign, as well as its ability to deal with dynamic challenges and events.

As part of the Security Cabinet's role in the exercise, Prime Minister Netanyahu and the Security Cabinet ministers are receiving comprehensive briefings on each scenario, as they would receive regarding combat in real time. Together with the IDF, they are optimally preparing for the simulated threats. During the simulated assessment, the importance of the 'Firm Hand' exercise regarding readiness for future emergencies is being emphasized.
