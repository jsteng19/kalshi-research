Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with Noa Litman, the wife of Rabbi Yaakov Litman and mother of Netanel Litman, who were murdered yesterday in a terrorist attack near Otniel. The Prime Minister expressed his condolences and those of the nation over the terrible loss. Noa Litman told him that a Red Crescent ambulance stopped at the scene of the attack but rendered no assistance to the wounded and told the family to contact Magen David Adom.

Prime Minister Netanyahu instructed the Foreign Ministry to file a sharp protest with the International Committee of the Red Cross, which is responsible for the Red Crescent, and request explanations for the abandonment of Jewish injured in contravention of all human and civilized norms. "If things are indeed as they seem to me today, the State of Israel will take appropriate steps against the Red Crescent," the Prime Minister said.
