Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thanks Middle East Quartet envoy Tony Blair:

"In recent years Tony Blair has made great efforts to advance stability and peace in the region.

His deep understanding of the Middle East helped him to develop a reliable network of contacts with heads of state in the region.

Tony Blair worked to advance important economic projects between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. Many times his understanding helped him to bridge gaps between the positions of the sides in the region including in times of crisis.

Israel appreciates and esteems his work and his determination. I hope that in the future as well he will be able to continue contributing from his experience on behalf of regional peace and stability.‚Äù
