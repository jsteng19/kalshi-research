Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara, today (Sunday, 6 July 2014), visited the families of Eyal Yifrach, Gilad Shaar and Naftali Frankel, the three youths who were abducted and murdered by Hamas terrorists.

At the Yifrach family home in Elad, Iris and Uri told how their son Eyal was talented and full of joy for life. Prime Minister Netanyahu emphasized that murderous terrorism has pursued our people in the new era for almost 100 years and told how he has dealt with the bereavement since his brother Lt.-Col. Yoni Netanyahu fell in the Entebbe operation exactly 38 years ago. The Prime Minister signed a copy of the book of his brother's letters: "To the noble Yifrach family, which is dear to us and the entire Jewish People – In your deep sorrow over the fall of the unforgettable Eyal, may his memory be for a blessing. (Signed) Sara, Yair, Avner and Benjamin."

At the Frankel family home in Nof Ayalon, Naftali's parents told the Prime Minister and his wife about Naftali's musical talent, which found expression in his playing the guitar and in his singing Shabbat songs. Prime Minister Netanyahu told the Frankels that he appreciated the family's fortitude and noted that in the long war with our enemies, we must – first of all – be familiar with the truth of the history of the Jewish People, and afterwards fight for this truth.

Toward evening, Prime Minister Netanyahu and his wife visited the Shaar family home in Talmon. Family members told the Prime Minister that the solidarity of the nation and the unity, the likes of which have not been seen regarding a tragic event and which found expression in the thousands of people who came to the funerals, strengthens them and warms their hearts.

Sara Netanyahu told the families that she, like the entire Jewish People, was deeply impressed by their strength of spirit.
