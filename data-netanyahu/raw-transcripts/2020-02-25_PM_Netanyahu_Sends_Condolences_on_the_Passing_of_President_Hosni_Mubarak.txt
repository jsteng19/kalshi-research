Prime Minister Netanyahu: “On behalf of the citizens and Government of Israel, I would like to express deep sorrow on the passing of President Hosni Mubarak. President Mubarak, my personal friend, was a leader who led his people to peace and security, to peace with Israel. I met with him many times. I was impressed by his commitment; we will continue to follow this common path. I would like to send condolences to President A-Sisi, to the Mubarak family and to the Egyptian people.”
