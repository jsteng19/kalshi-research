Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with representatives of the "Reservists Front", which is fighting against the activity of "Breaking the Silence". The "Reservists Front" numbers approximately 700 officers and soldiers, including approximately 150 reserve company commanders, who have set for themselves the goal of presenting the truth regarding the actions of IDF soldiers. They briefed the Prime Minister on their activity among MKs, public figures, public opinion-makers and the media.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

"I would like to thank you for your struggle for the truth, the truth about IDF soldiers and the IDF. You are company commanders and soldiers and you rightly cry out against he lies being spread about us and the slander of IDF soldiers that is being systematically carried out by a body that is simply spreading lies. I know of no other way to fight against the lie than by telling the truth and this is exactly what you are doing. You deserve all support, not just ours but that of all Israeli citizens and that of all those who hold dear the State of Israel and the IDF."
