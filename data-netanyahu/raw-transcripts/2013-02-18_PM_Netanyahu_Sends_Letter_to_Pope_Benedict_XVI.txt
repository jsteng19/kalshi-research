Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, sent the following letter to Pope Benedict XVI:

"Your Holiness,

On behalf of the people of Israel, I want to thank you for all you have done as Pope to strengthen relations between Christians and Jews and between the Vatican and the Jewish State. I thank you also for courageously defending Judeo-Christian values and the roots of our common civilization during your time as pontiff. I have no doubt that these values, which were so essential to building the modern world, are no less critical to securing a future of security, prosperity and peace.

Your historic visit to Israel in 2009 offered a rare opportunity to give expression to the new relations between our faiths. I remember fondly our meeting, in which you referred to Judaism as Christianity's elder brother and in which you reaffirmed your commitment to a cooperative future between Christians and Jews.

I thank you for your leadership during these very turbulent times, and wish you long life, health and happiness."
