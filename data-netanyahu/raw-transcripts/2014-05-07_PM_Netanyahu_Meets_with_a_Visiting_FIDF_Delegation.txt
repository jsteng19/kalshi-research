Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with a visiting Friends of the Israel Defense Forces delegation and said:

"Iran seeks to destroy the State of Israel and builds atomic bombs for that purpose. I want to reiterate Israel's position. We think that Iran must not have the capacity to make atomic bombs. Iran today has thousands of centrifuges, thousands of kilograms of enriched uranium to make a bomb. A bad deal would let them keep those capacities. It's better to have no deal than a bad deal.

Regarding the negotiations with the Palestinians, Prime Minister Netanyahu said: "The minimal requirement from our point of view is to say, 'Alright, do you recognize the Jewish state'. The other day, Abu Mazen said, 'I'm not even going to negotiate recognizing the Jewish state', and then he went to a deal with Hamas."
