Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening made the following remarks at the start of the Security Cabinet meeting:

"With heavy grief, this evening we found three bodies. All signs indicate that they are the bodies of our three abducted youths – Eyal Yifrach, Gilad Shaar and Naftali Frankel.

They were abducted and murdered in cold blood by human animals. On behalf of the entire Jewish People, I would like to tell the dear families – the mothers, fathers, grandmothers and grandfathers, and brothers and sisters – we are deeply saddened, the entire nation weeps with you. We will give the boys a proper burial. 'Vengeance for the blood of a small child, Satan has not yet created.' neither has vengeance for the blood of three pure youths, who were on their way home to meet their parents, who will not see them anymore.

Hamas is responsible – and Hamas will pay.

May the memories of the three boys be blessed."
