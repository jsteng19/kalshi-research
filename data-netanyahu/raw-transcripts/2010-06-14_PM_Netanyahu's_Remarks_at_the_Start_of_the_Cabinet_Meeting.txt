Following are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks at the start of the Cabinet meeting today:

"In consultation with Justice Minister Yaakov Neeman and Attorney General Yehuda Weinstein, I am, today, submitting to the Cabinet

a draft decision

establishing a special, independent public commission

to inquire into

the events of 31.5.10

Two main principles guided us in proposing the establishment of the commission. First is maintaining IDF soldiers' freedom of action and the credibility of

the IDF investigation

. According to the proposal, except for IDF Chief-of-Staff Lt.-Gen. Gaby Ashkenazi, IDF soldiers will not testify before the Commission. The IDF, via the team – chaired by Maj.-Gen. (ret.) Giora Eiland – that Chief-of-Staff Lt.-Gen. Ashkenazi has established will transfer to the Commission the summaries of its operational investigations.

The second principle that guided us is providing a credible and convincing response to the responsible countries in the international community about the events, especially in the context of international law. I am convinced that the Commission's uncovering of the facts will prove that the goals and actions of the State of Israel and the IDF were appropriate defensive actions in accordance with the highest international standards.

I estimate that the Cabinet's decision this morning to establish a special, independent public commission will make it clear to the entire world that the State of Israel acts according to law, transparently, and with full responsibility."
