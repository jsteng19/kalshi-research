Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today in his office, met with a delegation of Chinese Hebrew and Arabic students, as part of a project initiated by the Union of Local Authorities Foreign Liaison Department to mark 20 years of friendly relations between Israel and China.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said, "Welcome to Jerusalem. I know that the world is changing in China and Israel. China is growing and developing and Israel is growing and developing, and becoming a giant center for high-tech, science and agriculture; therefore, we must increase bilateral cooperation in all areas. Before, you asked me about Jerusalem. I would like to tell you that Jerusalem has been Israel's capital and will always be Israel's capital. I hope that more governments will recognize this as a simple fact. We are now sitting in Jerusalem, where Government offices, the Knesset and the Supreme Court are. Jerusalem was already the capital of the Jewish People 3,000 years ago."

Union of Local Authorities Chairman Shlomo Bohbot said, "We ascribe great importance to strengthening ties between Israel and China. I thank the Prime Minister for welcoming us to his office."
