Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. This evening:"The assault and cursing against IDF Binyamin Regional Brigade Commander Col. Eliav Elbaz, who commands the IDF forces that safeguard Israeli citizens, are a disgrace and I strongly condemn them. We will neither tolerate nor accept any kind of violence against IDF officers and soldiers."
