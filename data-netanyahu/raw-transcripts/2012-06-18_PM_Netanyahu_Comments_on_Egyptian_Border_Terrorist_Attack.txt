Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today at a meeting of the Likud Knesset faction, made the following remarks:

"Today there was

a terrorist attack on our border with Egypt

, during which an Israeli civilian, a resident of Haifa, Said Fashfashe, a father of four, was killed. We send condolences to his family.

During the incident, two terrorists were killed. The operation was most likely directed against Israeli citizens and was initiated against workers building our security fence on the Egyptian border. This will not stop us.

This fence is designed to prevent both terrorism and the entry of infiltrators. From our perspective, its construction is a supreme national interest. I believe that if we hadn't decided two years ago to build the fence, we would be facing a flood of infiltrators and – no less than this – a flood of terrorism."
