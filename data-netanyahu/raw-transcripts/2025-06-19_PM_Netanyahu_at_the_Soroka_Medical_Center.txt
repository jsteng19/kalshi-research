Statement by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday:

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the Soroka Medical Center: "We are hitting with precision the targets of the nuclear and missile programs, and they're hitting the children's ward of a hospital. That tells you everything"

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited today, along with the Minister of Health and the Mayor of Be'er-Sheva, the Soroka Medical Center that was damaged due to missile fire from Iran.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu:

"I am here at the Soroka Hospital in Be'er-Sheva, together with the Minister of Health, Deputy Minister Almog Cohen, a resident of the South, and also, not for the first time, the director of the Soroka Hospital. We see the whole difference here.

We are hitting with precision the targets of the nuclear and missile programs, and they're hitting a hospital, where people can't even get up and run away.

They're hitting not far from here — there's a children and babies ward here. That's the whole difference between a democracy taking lawful action to save itself from these murderers —and these murderers whose aim is to destroy every one of us. Each and every one of us, until the very last one among us. I think that tells you everything".
