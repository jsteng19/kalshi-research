Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his wife Sara and their sons Yair and Avner visited the Mamshit National Park in the Negev. During their visit an eagle, which had been treated by the Israel Nature and Parks Authority and Safari Park animal hospital, was set free.

The Netanyahu family also visited Dimona and the cyber park in Be'er Sheva.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said, "My family and I are here enjoying our country's scenic vistas, like very many Israeli families. We are here at Mamshit, an ancient city in the Negev. We see here our Negev both in its ancient glory and the bright future that is being built in cities such as Dimona and Be'er Sheva, which we will visit later today. Next to Tel Sheva, where our patriarch Abraham lived almost 4,000 years ago, we are building the cyber city and are taking the future in hand. I hope all hikers in Israel enjoy themselves and stay safe. Be careful so that the holiday will continue to be joyous. I would also like to thank the soldiers of the IDF and the personnel of the Border Police, Israel Police and the security services for guarding us on a daily basis. I would also like to take this opportunity to send wishes for a complete recovery to the wounded IDF soldiers who acted with courage and determination to foil the terrorist attack. A happy holiday to you and to all Israel."

Prime Minister Netanyahu also referred to the deal with Iran: ""Israel shares the view that upon the expiry of the nuclear agreement with Iran the latter's breakout time to achieve nuclear weapons will be zero. This will be the inevitable result of the automatic lifting of the restrictions, which would enable Iran to achieve an industrial-grade production capability."
