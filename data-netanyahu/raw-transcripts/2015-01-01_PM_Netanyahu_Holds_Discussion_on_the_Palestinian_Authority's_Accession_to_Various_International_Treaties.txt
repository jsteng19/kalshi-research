Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this afternoon at his Tel Aviv office, held a discussion on the Palestinian Authority's accession to various international treaties, and made the following remarks at the end of the meeting:

"We expect the International Criminal Court to reject outright the Palestinian Authority's hypocritical act because the Palestinian Authority is not a state. It is an entity in alliance with a terrorist organization, Hamas, which perpetrates war crimes. The State of Israel is a nation of laws with a moral army that upholds international law. We will defend the soldiers of the IDF just as they defend us."
