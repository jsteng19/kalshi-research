At the beginning of the meeting, Prime Minister Netanyahu said that, "Seventy years ago, the Jewish People were helpless. It had no ability – neither political, nor military nor diplomatic – to organize its defense, and one-third of our people were annihilated. The difference between 1942 and 2012 is not the absence of enemies, that same desire to destroy the Jewish People and the State that has arisen, this desire exists and has not changed. The difference is our ability to defend ourselves and to do so with determination. The Jewish People and the Government of Israel have the obligation and the right to prevent another annihilation of the Jewish People or attack on its state."

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, at the weekly Cabinet meeting this morning reviewed

a special exhibition of posters

for

International Holocaust Remembrance Day

The exhibition is part of an international project to encourage design students from around the world to express their views on the issue of remembering the Holocaust. The exhibition,

which will open at the UN building in New York on Thursday, 26.1.12

(the posters will be on display at the UN, at all 73 UN Information Centers around the world, and in many other locations), is an initiative of the Yad Vashem International School for Holocaust Studies and the Ministry of Public Diplomacy and Diaspora Affairs, and is based on the well-known and successful model – Israel's official poster design competition for Holocaust Martyrs and Heroes Remembrance Day.
