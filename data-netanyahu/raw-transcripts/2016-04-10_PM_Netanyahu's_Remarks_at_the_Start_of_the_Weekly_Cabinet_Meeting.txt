Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this morning made the following remarks at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting:

"Today the Cabinet will hear an ISA briefing that shows a significant decline in the scope of terrorist attacks. I say this with great caution because this trend could reverse itself, but we know that it has been achieved up to now as a result of the government's strong, responsible and methodical policy. I would like to commend the IDF, ISA and Israel Police for implementing this policy, for the alertness of the soldiers, police and commanders, and for the combined offensive and defensive effort that has led to the terrorists' succeeding less.

The main element leading the spread of terrorism, both here and elsewhere, is success. To the extent that we reduce the success rate, we reduce the number of those joining, and this is the main thing that we are doing, along with – of course – very strong actions against the incitement of the Palestinian public.

Today, the Cabinet will discuss a multi-year plan for strengthening the security of Jerusalem, improve law enforcement and boost personal security in the Arab sector. In the next five years, we will build new police stations, recruit 2,600 officers and strengthen police operational capabilities.

We want equality in law enforcement. This equality does not exist in Jerusalem and the Arab public is paying dearly. The State of Israel is paying dearly. We want a single nation of law without enclaves in which the law is not upheld. We also want to reduce other gaps in society at large and in Israeli Arab society. We want to integrate them in all walks of like in the country – and this is what we will do. The step that we are taking today will reduce the gaps in law enforcement and personal security."
