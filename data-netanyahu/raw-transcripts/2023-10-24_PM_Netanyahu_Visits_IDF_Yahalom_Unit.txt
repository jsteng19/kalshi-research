Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the IDF Yahalom Unit (special unit of the Combat Engineering Corps), at the IDF Immanuel Base, and was accompanied by the Head of Ground Forces Command, Maj.-Gen. Tamir Yadai and IDF Chief Engineering Officer Brig.-Gen. Ido Mizrachi.

At the start of the visit, Prime Minister Netanyahu was briefed by Yahalom Unit commander Col. A on the activity of the unit since the start of the fighting and on its readiness for the future. The Prime Minister was also shown the elite unit's special capabilities, including underground activity and explosives.

The Prime Minister was also shown quantities of munitions that Hamas terrorists brought into the country as part of their campaign of murder, and which were seized by the Yahalom Unit and given over to the National Center for Neutralizing Ammunition which it operates.

Prime Minister Netanyahu to the soldiers:

"I want to tell you where we are at the moment. We are striking the enemy with great force. Yesterday, in our attacks in Gaza, we struck the enemy the harshest blow they have taken in a single day. We killed dozens of terrorists, possibly even more. At this very moment, we are clarifying the exact magnitude of the strike. However, we also know that even as we are active in additional sectors in the north, we are hitting whoever tries to attack us, in Judea and Samaria as well.

We stand before the next stage, it is coming. You know it and you are part of it; you are part of the vanguard. I greatly appreciate what you know how to do, your fighting spirit, your readiness to save our country from these animals, and I am certain that you will succeed.

We have only one mission â€“ to smash Hamas. We will not stop until we complete it, with your help. I rely on you; the people of Israel rely on you. I am proud of you and I salute you."
