Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this morning made the following remarks at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting:

"Good morning.

In recent days, we have witnessed several shocking cases of assaults on the elderly, including Holocaust survivors. We will not tolerate this. We will use the full authority of the Government of Israel to prevent such criminal acts and to severely punish the assailants.

Public Security Minister Yitzhak Aharonovitch will brief us today on the steps being taken by the Israel Police to prevent the recurrence of such phenomena. We have a deep obligation to the elderly in general and to Holocaust survivors in particular, first of all to their welfare and also to their security.

Today, the Cabinet will approve a proposal formulated by myself and Finance Minister Yair Lapid on the addition of NIS 50 million to the social welfare fund for the elderly and for Holocaust survivors, and I asked that an additional NIS 15 million be allocated for medicines, to make things easier for them.

These people survived the horrors of the Holocaust. They participated in Israel's wars. They built the State of Israel; they are witnesses to our revival. Our obligation to them is that we will do all that is necessary. We are giving today and we will add whatever is necessary.

Thank you."
