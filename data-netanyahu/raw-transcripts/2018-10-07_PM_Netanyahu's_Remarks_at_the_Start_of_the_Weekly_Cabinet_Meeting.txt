Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this morning, at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting, made the following remarks:

"I will open with this morning's event in the Barkan Industrial Zone. This was a very severe terrorist attack in which two Israelis were brutally murdered and a citizen was also wounded.

The security forces are in pursuit of the reprehensible murderer. I am certain that they will apprehend him and I am also certain that we will deal with him to the fullest extent of the law and quickly.

On behalf of myself and all government ministers I would like to send condolences to the families of the two people who were murdered and our hopes and prayers for a swift recovery for the woman who was wounded.

A short time ago I spoke with President Putin. We agreed to meet soon in order to continue the important inter-military security coordination. Israel will act at all times to prevent Iran from establishing a military presence in Syria and to thwart the transfer of lethal weapons to Hezbollah in Lebanon."
