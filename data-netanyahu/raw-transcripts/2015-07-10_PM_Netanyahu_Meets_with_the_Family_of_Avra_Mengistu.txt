Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this afternoon, visited the family of Avra Mengistu at their home in Ashkelon. At the end of the over one hour meeting, Prime Minister Netanyahu said:

"We are doing everything in our ability to return Avra to Israel, just as we are in contact with the family of the other Israeli citizen in order to bring him back to Israel as well. We face a very cynical and cruel enemy that denies the basic humanitarian obligation to send innocent citizens back to their country. We will not slacken and we will do everything necessary in order to bring these citizens back home."
