Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this afternoon was interviewed on ABC and CBS and told the latter, "The ruler of Iran, the Ayatollah Khamenei, says after this agreement is concluded that he's going to continue the battle against the United States. He's going to continue supporting terrorists in the Middle East and in the world. He's committed to Israel's destruction."

Prime Minister Netanyahu added, "This regime has just received a dream deal," and noted, "It's getting, it may get a deal that may block or delay Iran's path to one or two bombs for the next few years, assuming they don't cheat, but paves their way to many, many bombs after a decade or so, because they become a threshold state with full international legitimacy, unrestricted number of centrifuges within ten to 15 years in which they can build, breakout to many, many bombs, a nuclear arsenal in a very short time. And to boot, they also get a cash bonanza to fund their terrorists and aggression against us, against the region, against America and the world. So I think this is a very bad deal with a very bad regime. It's not good for anyone's security â€“ not ours, not yours."
