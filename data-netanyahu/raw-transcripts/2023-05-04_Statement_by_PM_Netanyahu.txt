Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this morning: "This morning, we settled accounts with the murderers of Lucy, Maya and Rina Dee, may their memories be blessed. Our message to those who harm us, and those who want to harm us, is that whether it takes a day, a week or a month – you can be certain that we will settle accounts with you. It does not matter where you try to hide – we will find you. Whoever attacks us will pay the price. I would like to thank the security agencies and our brave soldiers who worked night and day to settle accounts with the murderers."
