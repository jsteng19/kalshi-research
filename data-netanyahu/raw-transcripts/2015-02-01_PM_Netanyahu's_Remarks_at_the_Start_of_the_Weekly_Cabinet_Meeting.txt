Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made the following remarks at the start of the Cabinet meeting:

"Today the Cabinet will be briefed on recent events on our northern border. On Friday, the Defense Minister and I visited our soldiers who were wounded in the terrorist attack on the northern border. I was very impressed by their determination and their desire to rejoin their comrades at the front and defend our country.

The State of Israel is threatened on many fronts. Over the weekend we witnessed how terrorist elements operate beyond our southern border in Sinai and we have also seen Iran's attempts to open another front against us on the Golan Heights, in addition to the front it is operating against us in southern Lebanon.

We have proven that nobody is immune from our intention to foil attacks against us. Thus we have acted and thus we will continue to act."
