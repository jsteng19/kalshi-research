Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the Magen David Adom (MDA) Blood Bank: "What you're doing here is unparalleled in the world. You're saving lives. That is the people of Israel and the State of Israel at their best"

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited today the MDA Blood Bank in Ramla, along with MDA Global President Gilad Erdan, MDA Director-General Eli Bin, Chair of the MDA Executive Committee Rabbi Avraham Manela and other top MDA officials.

The Prime Minister undertook a comprehensive tour of the MDA Blood Bank, the world's first facility of that type to be located underground, and the protected 101 call center. In addition, he was presented with an overview of MDA's specialized emergency vehicles.

During the visit, Prime Minister Netanyahu made a nationwide announcement to the MDA teams, saying: "I am greatly impressed by the system that was built here, and by the thousands of volunteers. You are saving lives, and I would like to express my gratitude on behalf of the citizens of Israel. You are doing a marvelous job, thank you — you are amazing".

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu:

"I am greatly impressed. As I saw here the motorcycles, the ambulances, the buses, the laboratories, I am greatly impressed by all that, but first and foremost, I am greatly impressed by you. There's no such thing anywhere in the world. What you've done here, what you're doing here, is unparalleled in the world. Primarily in terms of the equipment, the technology. But the structure of the activists, the volunteers — that is the people of Israel and the State of Israel at their best".
