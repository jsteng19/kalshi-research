Following are statements by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and IDF Chief-of-Staff Lt.-Gen. Herzi Halevi, today, at the Kirya in Tel Aviv, at the start of a security assessment. (All statements are translated from Hebrew.) Prime Minister Netanyahu: ”I am here at a security assessment with Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and IDF Chief-of-Staff Lt.-Gen. Herzi Halevi. We are working together as an iron fist for one objective – to eliminate Hamas. We back each other and we back the IDF – our soldiers and our commanders. I want the citizens of Israel to know something else: We make the decisions here and in the War Cabinet unanimously. We do so with great responsibility. We do so with deep awareness. We are fighting together and we will win together, only together." Defense Minister Gallant: "In recent days, I have been on visits and inspections around the country. I have met with soldiers in the north, in the Ground Forces, the Navy and the Air Force. I have met reservists and conscripts. All of these soldiers are very determined to carry out their missions. They are undergoing a thorough and lengthy preparation process. They are ready for their missions. I specially note the commanders, from junior officers up to the Chief-of-Staff, who have been doing excellent work during the war and are ready to continue it. I welcome the formation of the War Cabinet. I think it is a blessing for the State of Israel and for the people of Israel. It is a message of unity for all of us here in the country and to our enemies ahead of the difficult stages that await us in the war." IDF Chief-of-Staff Lt.-Gen. Halevi: "We are conducting a war. I have seen that the forces in the field are ready and prepared. We discuss complex issues here every evening. The political leadership and the IDF are holding substantive discussions. We see only one one thing – the security of the State of Israel."
