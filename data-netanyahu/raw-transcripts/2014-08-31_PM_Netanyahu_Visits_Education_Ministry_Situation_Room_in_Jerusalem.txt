Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening at the Education Ministry situation room in Jerusalem, attended an assessment in which he and Education Minister Shai Piron spoke with Education Ministry district representatives ahead of tomorrow's opening of the new school year.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said, "I would like to congratulate Education Minister Piron and the people at his ministry and the teachers who worked under uncertain conditions to prepare for the start of the school year. Tomorrow we will tour Sderot and communities in the area adjacent to the Gaza Strip in order to observe the opening of the school year there. We wish all Israeli children, schools and kindergartens a successful, productive and safe year. I would like to say something to the children of Israel. I know that you did not have a real summer vacation. I hope that during the coming holidays you will find time to relax and rest long with your families and friends. I would like to commend you for listening to your parents during the recent operation and for being part of our national unity, which is a very important part of the national; resilience of the State of Israel. I would like to promise you, parents, along with Minister Piron and the teachers, that we will continue to act so that your children will be safe this year. May it be a successful year in every respect."
