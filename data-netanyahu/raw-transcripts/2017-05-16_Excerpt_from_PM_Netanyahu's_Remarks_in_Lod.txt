Following is an excerpt from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks today at the signing of a roof agreement for the Municipality of Lod:

"I come here from a meeting with US Ambassador to Israel David Friedman. We had a very good meeting. We discussed the friendship between the two countries and I told him that the US Embassy – like all embassies – should be moved to Jerusalem."
