PM Netanyahu made the following remarks:

"I spoke with US President Donald Trump on Monday and with American Secretary of State Mike Pompeo yesterday. The American administration told me that it is the President's intention to withdraw their forces from Syria. They made it clear that they have other ways of expressing their influence in the area. This is, of course, an American decision. We will study its timetable, how it will be implemented and – of course – its implications for us. In any case we will take care to maintain the security of Israel and to defend ourselves in this area."
