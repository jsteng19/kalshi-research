Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this evening issued the following statement:

"On behalf of all citizens of Israel, I would like to thank the Israel Police, ISA, and the police special anti-terrorism unit â€“ they did their work professionally, methodically, day and night; they focused on the mission and they achieved it. All those who would murder Israelis should know that sooner or later we will find them, inside and outside the borders of the State of Israel. No one is immune. We will find the murderers and their accomplices."
