Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this morning, made the following remarks at his meeting with Quartet envoy Tony Blair: "The real thing we have is rockets. We've got Hamas, supported by Iran, firing rockets at us. They’ve fired again. We're not going to let anyone arm themselves and fire rockets on us and think that they can do this with impunity. They're not going to get away with it. We attacked them before, we attacked them after and we're going to prevent them from arming themselves. This is our policy. This is a very different policy that I put in. You don’t let them get away with it. And they know that's what we're doing. "
