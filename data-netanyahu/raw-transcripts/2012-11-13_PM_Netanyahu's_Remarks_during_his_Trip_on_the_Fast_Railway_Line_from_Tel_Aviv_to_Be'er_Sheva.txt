Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today traveled on the upgraded fast railway line from Tel Aviv to Be'er Sheva and made the following remarks during the trip:

"Hello to you.

I chose to go the south today, to Be'er Sheva, on the upgraded railway line in order to personally experience the fast link between the center of the country and the south, and between the south and the center. This line makes it possible to go down to Be'er Sheva in less than an hour; eventually it will be within 45 minutes. This is a national socio-economic revolution of the highest order.

I go down to the south in both happy and less happy times. Yesterday I was in the south, today I am in the south and next week I will also be there. We will meet with mayors from the communities adjacent to the Gaza Strip, from Be'er Sheva and from the south in general, in order to solve their problems and allow them to enjoy a more secure and developing future. The railway is one expression of this development and this future."
