International Human Rights Day is a day in which the State of Israel stands proud - proud of its record as a vibrant, pluralistic, democracy – a democracy that has maintained its values despite security challenges faced by no other nation on earth. We’re proud to be a country that is governed by laws, not men -where protests in town squares is a way of life. It’s not a sign of revolution. People go to the squares. They give voice to whatever protest and grievances they have. They do it on the internet, they do it in the newspapers; they do it on television. They do it in our Parliament, the Knesset in a robust, dynamic and free way that is an example for the entire democratic world. We’re proud that in a land plagued over the centuries by religious wars, Israel has rigorously safeguarded the Holy sites of the great faiths and we’ve protected the freedom of worship for all. We’re proud that in the Middle East, where women are stoned, and gays are hanged and minorities are persecuted, Israel has a woman who’s a Chief Justice. We have gay pride parades. We have over 1 million Arab citizens who are free. They’re free as I hope 300 million Arabs in the vast Middle East will be free one day. Perhaps there is such a future beckoning us and we hope that in the coming year we’ll see the advance of human rights in a region where they’ve long been denied, but I assure you one thing, Israel will continue to proudly raise the torch for freedom and human rights. A genuine democracy is what we’re about – not merely a majority vote, but individual rights, protected by an independent judiciary. So anyone seeking to genuinely build democratic societies in the Middle East should know that they will always have a partner and friend in the one and only Jewish state – the democratic State of Israel.
