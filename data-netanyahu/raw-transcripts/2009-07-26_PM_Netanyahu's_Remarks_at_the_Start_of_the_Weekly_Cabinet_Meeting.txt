Following are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting today:

"I would like to welcome the planned arrival to Israel of a series of senior US administration officials. Tomorrow, I will meet with Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, on Tuesday with envoy George Mitchell, and on Wednesday with National Security Advisor Gen. James L. Jones, who is arriving with a senior National Security Council, State Department and White House team, including Dennis Ross. They will also meet with ministers and senior security officials.

These important visits are being held as part of the ramified and tight network of links between Israel and the US , a network which has existed in the past and which continues to exist in the present as well. Our common interests encompass all the main areas of bilateral cooperation. I believe that such an intensive continuity in contacts with the US reflects our common denominator in the search for security stability, economic development, diplomatic progress and other strategic issues; this network of relations is important and steadfast.

Naturally, even within the fabric of friendly bilateral relations between two allies, there will not be full agreement on every point. On various issues, we are trying to reach the same understanding so that together we may advance our common goals â€“ peace, security and prosperity for the entire Middle East ."
