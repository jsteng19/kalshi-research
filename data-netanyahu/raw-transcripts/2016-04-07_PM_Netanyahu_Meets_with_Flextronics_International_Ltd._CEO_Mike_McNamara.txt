Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today met with Flextronics International Ltd. CEO Mike McNamara.

In Israel, Flextronics employs approximately 3,500 workers at production and research and development centers in Migdal Ha'emek, Ofakim, Sderot, Yavneh and Haifa. Flextronics in Israel has sales of $700 million per annum, over 90% of it for export.

Flextronics International CEO McNamara told Prime Minister Netanyahu that the company is expanding its activity in Israel, in Migdal Ha'emek, Ofakim, Yavneh and Haifa. He said that the advantage of the company, given its global reach, is its ability to make significant markets – such as China and India – accessible to Israeli technology firms.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said that Flextronics' commercial activity in Israel has created thousands of jobs in the economy and added that Flextronics is exactly the type of company that he would like to see developing in Israel, especially regarding the connection between research and development and advanced production.
