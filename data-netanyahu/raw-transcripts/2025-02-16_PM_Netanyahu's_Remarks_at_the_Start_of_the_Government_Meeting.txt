Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, at the start of the Government meeting today :

"I first met Eyal Zamir when I interviewed candidates for the position of Prime Minister's Military Secretary. I was impressed by his commitment to the country and to the IDF, as well as by the fact that he has an aggressive approach. I was looking for a Military Secretary with an aggressive approach and indeed I received one, and we learned to work together, of course. Afterward, I tried several opportunities to appoint him. I first recommended him to be Deputy Chief-of-Staff. But afterwards I tried to appoint him Chief-of-Staff, twice I think, and twice I was unsuccessful, and now a third opportunity has come.

I thank Herzi Halevi for his service and I fully support, together with the Defense Minister, the appointment of Eyal Zamir as the next IDF Chief-of-Staff. The first reason is that he has an aggressive approach. That the military is, along with the other security elements, subject to the decisions of the Government is self-evident. But I expect these same elements to bring before us, not politically-oriented viewpoints; with all due respect, that is not their role. Their role is to create for us options for subduing our enemies, to defeat the enemy. The first role of a military is to fight and defeat the enemy.

I coined two words: 'Total victory.' We received a lot of criticism for this, and much mockery, but it is clear to everyone that we stand before an opportunity to achieve victories that we did not dream of. I expect from Eyal Zamir, during his service, and perhaps very soon, that we will see these major achievements, which will change not only the status of Israel but the face of the entire Middle East.
