================================================================================

WILL BE  DECLARED THE  110th MAYOR.  THEY'VE BEEN  CAMPAIGNING FOR  MONTHS, AND  TONIGHT, THEY  SPEAK TO EACH  OTHER FOR THE  FIRST TIME.  I AM JOINED BY  MY COLLEAGUE AND  -- TELEMUNDO 47,  ALAN DALE A FUN  YEAR.  THIS IS A ONE  HOUR DEBATE  RIGHT HERE IN  CHANNEL 4. FOR  VOTERS WHO ARE  BLIND OR HAVE  LOW VISION, THE  CAMPAIGN IS  POSTING VISUAL  DESCRIPTIONS OF  OUR STUDIO,  MODERATORS AND  THE CANDIDATES  ON THEIR TWITTER  ACCOUNTS.  AT THE  MODERATORS  DISCUSSION.  WE CAN COVER A  LOT OF  TERRITORY.  WE ALSO RESERVE  THE RIGHT TO CUT  OFF YOUR  MICROPHONE IF  YOU IGNORE THE  RULES.  THE GOAL IS FOR  YOU TO HEAR EACH  OTHER AND FOR  NEW YORKERS TO  HEAR EVERYTHING  THAT YOU HAVE  SAID.  >> GOOD EVENING,  GENTLEMEN.  BIG NEWS TODAY.  MAYOR DE BLASIO  ANNOUNCED THAT  CITY EMPLOYEES  MUST BE  VACCINATED FOR  COVID BY THE END  OF THE MONTH OR  THEY WILL NOT BE  PAID.  THIS AFFECTS  46,000 WORKERS  WHO ARE NOT  VACCINATED.  THAT INCLUDES  THOUSANDS THAT  ARE POLICE  OFFICERS AND  FIREFIGHTERS.  DO YOU AGREE  WITH THE NEW  MANDATES.  AND AS MAYOR,  WILL YOU UPHOLD  THE -- OF POLICE  OFFICERS AND  FIREFIGHTERS.  >>-VACCINATED.  AND I KNOW I  WOULD HAVE TO --  WITH FAMILIES  AND HOSPITALS.  HOW TRAUMATIZED  OUR BUSINESS,  HOW DESTROYED --  HAS BEEN.  I BELIEVE THE  MAIN ACTION  TODAY WAS  CORRECT.  I WOULD HAVE  HANDLED IT  DIFFERENTLY.  I WOULD BE SET  DOWN BY UNION  MEMBERS AND SAT  DOWN WITH THE --  WHEN THEY FIRST  GOT AWAY.  CREDIBLE  MESSAGES.  I BELIEVE THAT  WE COULD COME TO  APPROPRIATE  PLACES WHERE WE  CAN VACCINATE  EVERY DAY NEW  YORKERS, WHEN  COVID UPHOLDS  THE AVENGING OF  POLICE OFFICERS  AND  FIREFIGHTERS.  >> YES, I WOULD.  I WOULD FOLLOW  THE RULES THAT  ARE IN PLACE.  >> -- OF THE TWO  OPPOSED THE  MATTER.  YOU HAVE ONE  MINUTE.  >> WELL, FIRST  OFF, I WANT TO  THANK NBC.  THIS IS THE  HOUSE OF -- THE  GREATEST TV  JOURNALIST OF  ALL-TIME.  NO DOUBT.  EMMY AWARD- WINNING.  ALL THE DEBATES  THAT YOU USED TO  HOST ON THIS  STAGE, IT'S A  PRIVILEGE FOR  ERIC AND I TO BE  HERE TODAY.  I DISAGREE WITH  ERIC.  I FEEL THAT WE  DON'T HAVE  ENOUGH POLICE  OFFICERS AS IT  IS.  SO NOW, AFTER  ESTABLISHING WHO  -- NOW WHAT DO  WE DO WITH THE  HEALTHCARE  WORKERS?  WHO ARE CRAWLING  INTO THE BELLY  OF THE BEAST.  I KNOW, BECAUSE  I AM THE  GUARDIAN ANGEL  WHO IS TAKING  CARE OF THE  WILLFULLY  DISTURBED AND  THAT CLUELESS.  WE CHEER THEM AT  NIGHT AT 7:00.  AND ALL OF A  SUDDEN, WE  DECIDED WHO IS  SUSPECT  SUPPORTING ERIC  ADAMS HERE.  THEY COULD LOSE  THEIR JOBS.  THAT IS THE  HARDEST -- THAT  THEY WERE GOING  TO BE  VACCINATED.  >> FIRST OF ALL,  I DID NOT SEE --  ON THE GROUND.  RESPONDING TO  CRISES.  SO IT'S EASY TO  TALK ABOUT WHAT  HAPPENED.  I WAS THERE.  EVEN LAST WEEK.  >> WE WERE TO  ASK YOU BOTH  ABOUT -- I WAS  ABSENT?  THERE IS  DOCUMENTARY  EVIDENCE THAT I  WENT TO PENN  STATION RIDING  THE SUBWAY.  PENDING TO THE  EMOTIONALLY  DISTURBED.  AND YOU WERE NOT  TENDING.  WE, AS THE  GUARDIAN ANGELS  WITH A FIRST- LINE MAKING SURE  THAT THESE DID  NOT GET --  >> SPECIFICALLY  LEADING --  >> YOU SAY YOU  ARE PROUD  OUTSIDER.  AMONGST LEADERS  THAT I KNOW.  BECAUSE I HAVE  WORKED WITH --  AFTER WALKING  OUT AFTER  PRESIDENT JOE  BIDEN AS HIS  TEAMMATE HAD  SAID BEFORE,  BILL DE BLASIO,  WE NEED 38,000  COPS.  WE SHOULD HAVE  TAKEN THE MONEY  FROM THE FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT.  INSTEAD, I WILL  HAVE A PROPERTY  TAX AGAINST  MADISON SQUARE  GARDEN, AGAINST  NYU.  AND FIRST OF  ALL, BY ANDREW  YANG, WHICH IS A  GOOD CANDIDATE.  FOR EVERY  OPPORTUNITY YOU  HAVE, ERIC  ADAMS.  THROWING THE  DEMOCRATIC  PARTY.  I WOULD USE THAT  MONEY  SPECIFICALLY TO  HIRE 3000 COPS  THAT WE  DESPERATELY  NEED.  WE HAVE DONE BY  TAKING PETER  MALONE.  AND THAT IS WHY  WE WERE ABLE TO  GET ON BOARD  BACK INTO THE  STREETS OF NEW  YORK CITY IN  1999.  >> MR. ADAMS,  YOU WERE A  LEADER IN THE  NYPD.  AND YOU  CRITICIZED THE  DEPARTMENT AT  TIMES.  WHICH POSITION  DO YOU IDENTIFY  WITH MOST?  HOW WILL THAT  INFLUENCE THE  WAY THAT YOU  LEAN?  >> FIRST OF ALL,  LET'S BE CLEAR.  INCRIMINATION  AND -- ARE  TAKING FAMILIES  IN FOR CRIME  AGAINST THE  PERSON WHO MADE  UP CRIMES SO  THAT HE CAN BE  POPULAR.  MADE UP CRIMES  IN THE OFFICE.  THAT IN ITSELF  IS A CRIME.  I AM NOT A  CRITIC, BUT I'VE  SAID OVER AND  OVER AGAIN,  PUBLIC SAFETY,  AND INJUSTICE.  WE'RE GOING TO  ENSURE THAT  NUMBER ONE, IF  YOU DECIDE NOT  TO HAVE THE --  OUR POWER CRISIS  MANAGEMENT TEAM.  WE'RE GOING TO  TREAT A NEW  ECOSYSTEM WITH  THE TRUST.  THAT IS NOT  GOING TO HAPPEN.  WAS NOT GOING TO  SEE --  >> THANK YOU,  DAVID.  >> HOW DO YOU  RESPOND TO THAT?  BECAUSE THE  SYSTEM THAT I  MADE, ERIC, I  MUST NOTE, YOU  WROTE AN OP-ED  PIECE SAYING  THAT AS A --  COP, YOU WERE  SWORN THAT SHE  WOULD NOT  HARASS.  SECONDARILY, YOU  REALIZE THAT I  WAS SHOT FIVE  TIMES ON THE  ORDERS OF JOHN  GODEY'S SENIOR  AND MY BATTLES  AGAINST THE  ORGANIZED CRIME  FAMILY.  I DO NOT KNOW  WHERE YOU WERE  AT THAT POINT.  YOU ARE MISSING  IN ACTION LIKE  SO MANY OTHERS.  SO PLEASE, I PUT  MY LIFE ON THE  LINE.  I HAVE BEEN SHOT  IN ORDER TO  PROVIDE --  >> TWO SECONDS,  MR. ADAMS.  >> THIS IS --  HIMSELF THAT HE  MADE UP CRIMES  IN NEW YORK.  THAT IS A CRIME.  AND WHEN HE WAS  PLAYING COP, I  WAS ON THE  SUBWAY SYSTEM,  WRITING THAT  SYSTEM DURING  THE MID-80s, A  RADIO THAT DID  NOT WORK.  AND --  >> WE MAY  ACTUALLY HAVE A  QUESTION.  THIS ONE, FOR  THE NYPD.  >> SPECIFICALLY,  YOU CALLED FOR A  RETURN FOR WHAT  YOU REFER TO AS  OLD ALWAYS.  INCLUDING STOP  AND FRISK.  THE TACTIC WAS  RULED IN  CONSTITUTIONAL  FOR  DISPROPORTIONATELY  AFFECTING YOUNG  MEN OF COLOR.  HOW WILL YOU  PROTECT INNOCENT  NEW YORKERS FROM  UNWANTED  SEARCHERS AND  INTERROGATION.  >> FIRST OF ALL,  IT IS  CONSTITUTIONAL.  AS MY OPPONENT  HAS ALSO SAID.  HE WOULD  SELECTIVELY  ALLOW FOR THE  USE OF STOP,  QUESTION AND  FRISK.  I WOULD NOT DO  WHAT ONE OF HIS  MAIN SUPPORTERS,  MICHAEL MOORE  DID, MAYOR FOR  THE LAST FOUR  YEARS, WHICH WAS  TO HAVE SEVERAL  HUNDRED THOUSAND  PREDOMINATELY  MEN OF COLOR BE  STOPPED IN -- AT  THE SYSTEM WHERE  THEY HAD TO FILL  OUT AT LEAST  5:50 PER DAY.  HE'S ACCEPTED  THIS -- FOR  MICHAEL  BLOOMBERG WHO  ABUSED STOP,  QUESTION AND  FRISK.  I SUGGEST IF HE  WAS USED  ESPECIALLY IN  AREAS WHERE  THERE WAS GANG  ACTIVITY,  CONSTANT  CONNECTIVITY.  THAT IT BE AT  LEAST UTILIZED  BY POLICE  OFFICERS WHO  HAVE TO  PREEMPTIVELY  STOP THE GAME,  STOP THE GUN  VIOLENCE,  BECAUSE IT'S  GOING TO TAKE IT  FORWARD FOR  INNOCENT  CITIZENS IN  THEIR HOME AT  SOLITARY  CONFINEMENT.  THAT IS NOT FAIR  TO THEM.  >> THANK YOU,  MR. ADAMS.  >> THIS IS AN  EXCELLENT  OPPORTUNITY FOR  NEW YORKERS.  LET'S BE CLEAR.  I HAVE SPENT MY  ENTIRE 22 YEARS  ON BEHALF OF  POLICE FORM  AFTER BEING  ARRESTED AND  OBSTRUCTED BY  POLICE OFFICERS  WHO DID NOT  ALWAYS HAVE -- I  BECAME A  CAPTAIN, WAS  INVOLVED IN --  AND I PASSED  LEGISLATION  WITHIN  GOVERNMENT --  THAT ALLOWED THE  REFUSAL.  >> MR. ADAMS.  >> WE HAVE A  VERY SPECIFIC  QUESTION FOR  YOU.  >> SO WE ARE  TRYING TO STAY  IN -- YOU TO  HAVE CALLED FOR  MORE AGGRESSIVE  POLICE -- WITH  STOP AND FRISK,  IF USED  APPROPRIATELY,  AND REINSTATING  THE CRIME UNIT.  HOW WILL YOU  PROTECT BLACK  NEW YORKERS FROM  BEING  DISPROPORTIONATELY  TARGETED?  YOU HAVE 4  MINUTES.  >> I PROTECT THE  BLACK AND BROWN.  AS A POLICE  OFFICER, WHEN I  WAS FIGHTING FOR  -- TESTIFYING IN  FEDERAL COURT  ABOUT THE  OVERDUE STOP AND  ASK PLOY.  JUDGE SHANDLING,  ACKNOWLEDGING --  BY TESTIMONY.  PLAYING A ROLE  IN HER DECISION.  WENT TO ALBANY,  PASSED  LEGISLATION TO  GET THE DATABASE  THAT HELD  INNOCENT PEOPLE  INSIDE.  A VICTIM OF STOP  AND FRISK IN THE  CITY.  AND I NEVER  CALLED FOR  AGGRESSIVE POLICE TACTICS.  I CALL FOR  APPROPRIATE  TACTICS.  THE NEW ANTI-GUN  -- AND POSES 0  ON GANGS AND  GUNS.  ALSO PRESENTING  RESOURCES.  I HAVE BEEN  CLEAR ON THIS  MESSAGE FOR THE  LAST 35 YEARS.  -- WAS SHOT IN  SOUTHEAST  QUEENS.  >> LET ME  SUGGEST THAT  ERIC ADAMS, YOU  ARE A PROPONENT  OF CARRYING A  GUN.  YOU HAVE SAID,  TIME AND TIME  AGAIN, WHEN YOU  ARE PRESIDENT  AND --, I WOULD  CARRY A GUN IN  CHURCH.  AND YOU SAID YOU  KNOW, WHEN I'M  MAYOR, I AM  GOING TO CARRY A  GUN.  I AM IN THE  INNER-CITY ALL  THE TIME.  I DON'T WEAR A  BULLETPROOF  VEST.  AND I'LL TELL  YOU, IF YOU'RE  GOING TO REACH  YOUNG MEN WHO  ARE USING GUNS  IN VIOLENT  ACTION, YOU  CANNOT DO AS I  SAY, BUT NOT AS  THEY DO.  >> WHY WOULD YOU  NEED A GUN?  IN I HAVE BEEN  SHOT FIVE TIMES  OFF THE --  >> MR. ADAMS,  LET'S MOVE ON,  MR. ADAMS.  A QUICK  RESPONSE.  MAKING UP --  LIKE HE MADE THE  CRIME.  YOUNG MEN STOP  ME ALL THE TIME.  BECAUSE OF MY  ADVOCACY, I  PASSED  UNBELIEVABLE  LEGISLATION.  AND MADE SURE  THAT WE HAD --  AT THE MOMENT.  AND MY RECORD IS  CLEAR.  YOU KNOW THAT  AND I KNOW THAT.  AND I'M PROUD OF  HOW I HAVE  HELPED THIS CITY  AND HOW I WILL  CONTINUE TO  PROTECT NEW  YORK.  >> THANK YOU.  >> WE HAVE A  HUGE DEBATE  ABOUT IT.  >> A FEW  QUESTIONS.  WE ARE LOOKING  FOR SHORTER  ANSWERS HERE,  CANDIDATES.  THE FIRST IS ON  HELPING TAXI  DRIVERS.  A HUNGER STRIKE  WAS LAUNCHED  TODAY FOR TAXI  DRIVERS.  WHAT WILL YOU DO  FOR TAXI  DRIVERS?  >> IT PLAYS A  VITAL ROLE IN  MIDDLE-CLASS  WORKING MEN.  I CONTINUE TO  SAY, I WOULD  SUPPORT THOSE  MIDDLE-CLASS --  FROM UNIONS THAT  ENDORSE -- WHAT  WE CAN DO IS  ALLOW THEM THE  SAME PLATFORM AS  THE UBER DRIVERS  ARE GOING ON  RIGHT NOW, WHICH  WOULD ALLOW THEM  TO NOT ONLY DO  STREET -- BUT  ALSO, SOME  AMAZING WAYS  THAT GOOBERS  COULD --  >> ALL RIGHT,  ALL RIGHT.  WHAT WOULD YOU  DO FOR NEW YORK  CITY?  >> THE OTHER  DAY, ERIC ADAMS  WAS SUPPOSED TO  MEET MICHAEL:.  AND KANYE WEST.  MICHAEL:HIMSELF  HAD DOZENS AND  DOZENS OF  MEDALLIONS WITH  -- FROM THE  UKRAINE AND  RUSSIA WHO  KILLED -- NOW,  THE INDIVIDUAL  ON OUR OPERATORS  OF MEDALLIONS,  WE NEED TO SEE  HOW WE CAN HELP  THEM.  BUT I DON'T WANT  TO USE TAXPAYER  MONEY TO BAIL  OUT MEDALLION  OWNERS FOR  RUSSIAN,  UKRAINIAN  OLIGARCHS.  IN YOUR NEWFOUND  FRIEND, MICHAEL  COLE WITH DOZENS  AND I LESSONS OF  MEDALLIONS.  >> WHEN I ASKED  YOU ABOUT --  THIS WEEK, THEY  DECIDED TO  REMOVE A STATUE  OF THOMAS  JEFFERSON FROM  -- AS HIS  HISTORY AS A  SLAVE OWNER.  SO YOU AGREE  WHAT THE STATUTE  SHOULD BE.  >> ABSOLUTELY  NOT.  ALTHOUGH, THEY  HAVE MADE THEIR  DECISION.  NOW, I THINK  THEY WOULD  REPURPOSE AND  FIND THOMAS  JEFFERSON, WHO  CREATED OUR  DECLARATION OF  INDEPENDENCE.  >> IT'S A GREAT  TIME TO FOLLOW  INSTRUCTIONS.  ASKING --  >> ALL RIGHT.  THANK YOU BOTH.  I WANT ASK YOU  ABOUT A GUIDE  FOR MANY  RESTAURANTS THAT  SURVIVE THE  PANDEMIC BY  PARKING SPACES.  WOULD YOU ALLOW  THE STRUCTURES  TO REMAIN WHERE  THEY ARE?  >> IS THAT A YES  OR NO QUESTION?  >> YES OR NO?  >> YOU KNOW, HE  COULD LAND A 747  JET.  WE'VE GOT TO  DOWNSIZE.  TAKING UP ALL OF  THAT UNNEEDED  SPACE WHERE THE  BICYCLE IS.  THE VEHICLES AND  THE PEDESTRIANS.  >> ALL RIGHT,  THANK YOU.  SO WE COME BACK  ON THE --  GETTING PEOPLE  BACK INTO THE  OFFICE.  ESPECIALLY  CRITICAL TO  RESTORING -- THE  CEO OF OUR  WORKFORCE  COVERING MORE OF  THAT -- WITH  106,000.  WILL YOU REQUIRE  CITY WORKERS TO  -- IN PLACE OF  WORK FULL-TIME.  AND HOW WILL YOU  HANDLE THOSE.  YOU HAVE 30  SECONDS?.  >> HOPEFULLY, I  WILL SEE YOU  THIS JUNE FOR  THE PUERTO RICAN  DAY PARADE.  AND I CAN JUMP  ON YOUR  TELEMUNDO PHONE  AND WE CAN BOTH  HAVE THE  MICROPHONE AND  SAY -- AND THEN  WE WILL KNOW  THAT NEW YORK  CITY IS BACK.  BUT TO BE  SPECIFIC, TO BE  SPECIFIC ABOUT  THIS.  HOW CAN THEY  ORDER ALL THE  CITY WORKERS  BACK WHEN  MEMBERS OF THE  CITY COUNCIL ARE  NOT BACK.  THEY ARE NOT IN  THEIR CHAMBERS.  IT SHOULD BE DO  AS I SAY AND DO  AS I DO.  SO LET THE CITY  COUNCIL GET BACK  IN THE CHAMBERS,  GET THEIR STUFF  BACK INTO THE  OFFICE ACROSS  CITY HALL, AND  THEN, THEY CAN  ISSUE THE MASKS  TO THE CIVIL  SERVANTS TO MAKE  SURE THEY ARE IN  THEIR WORK.  >> MR. ADAMS.  WHAT IS IT TO  YOU?  WILL YOU REQUIRE  WORKERS TO  RETURN TO THEIR  PLACE OF WORK  AND HOW WILL YOU  HANDLE THOSE IN  -- YOU ALSO HAVE  30 SECONDS.  >> INDIVIDUALLY,  WE MUST GET TO  THE PLACE WHERE  -- I BELIEVE  THAT WE SHOULD  DO -- WHERE THEY  COMPLETE A JOB  REMOTELY.  MY STAFF IN  BOROUGH HALL.  ONCE WE REACH A  SAFE PLACE AND  REALIZE WE ARE  NOT HAVING -- WE  CAN BRING BACK  AN ADDITIONAL  NUMBER.  BUT WE HAVE TO  GET THE CITY  BACK UP AND  RUNNING.  BECAUSE THAT  EMPLOYEE  SPENDING MONEY  IN THEIR  RESTAURANTS, THE  CAFETERIA, THEY  ARE GETTING  THEIR HAIR DONE  AND DOING OTHER  THINGS.  THAT IS PART OF  OUR ECOSYSTEM AS  WELL.  >> ERIKA, YOU  ARE WITH ME.  -- IN OFFICE.  YOU HAVE -- WITH  BROOKLYN.  I WOULD BRING  INTO QUESTION.  YOU HAVE TO TAKE  RESPONSIBILITY  HERE WITH THAT,  WITH YOUR  PARTNER.  >> OKAY, THANK  YOU.  WE HAVE TO  RESPOND.  I'M SORRY, MR.  ADAMS.  A QUICK YES OR  NO FOLLOW-UP FOR  YOU.  YOU WERE  ENDORSED BY THE  CITY OF -- AND  ARE NOW  CHALLENGING THE  ORDER TO COME  BACK TO WORK  FIVE DAYS A WEEK  IN PERSON.  MAYOR, WOULD YOU  SUPPOSE -- ON  THIS ISSUE, YES  OR NO?  >> IN RESPECT TO  PROTECT THE  UNION AND ALLOW  THE COURT TO  DECIDE.  >> WOULD YOU  SUPPORT THEM OR  OPPOSE THEM?  >> AS I SAID,  THEY HAVE A  RIGHT TO THE  COURT, AS ANY  OTHER -- DOES.  I WILL RESPECT  THE DECISION  THAT COMES TO  THE COURT.  >> WE WILL MOVE  ON TO THE  ECONOMY NO.  WE KNOW THERE  ARE FEARS ABOUT  CRIME AND -- BUT  SOME COMPANIES  ARE EXPECTING A  HYBRID MODEL  WHERE OFFICES  ARE ONLY SOLD  HALF THE WEEK.  YOU HAVE ONE  MINUTES.  >> TOO DIFFICULT  TO DO THIS IN  NEW YORK CITY.  WITH OUR  AGENCIES, THEY  ARE NOT  FRIENDLY.  WE NEED TO BE  CLEAR ON DOING  SO IMMEDIATELY,  DAY ONE, I WOULD  PUT IN TO PLACE  AN ORDER THAT  WILL SEND ALL --  TO OUR SMALL  BUSINESSES.  THEN, WE WILL  ENCOURAGE --  GETTING OUT TO  YOUNG FAMILIES  TO MAKE SURE  THAT WE DO  THINGS LIKE  UNIVERSAL  CHILDCARE.  PUTTING THAT  OVER $250,000  THAT WERE  AVAILABLE PRE- COVID AND DID  NOT HAVE THE  RIGHT TRAINING.  SO ONCE THE CITY  EMBRACES NEW  BUSINESS AND  ALLOWS -- FOR  CYBER SECURITY,  BIOTECH,  ASSISTIVE  TECHNOLOGY,  DRONE  DEVELOPMENT.  RIGHT NOW, WE  ARE IN AN  UNFRIENDLY CITY  FOR BUSINESSES  IN THE CITY.  >> WE HAVE TO  USE COMMON SENSE  AND THAT HAS TO  DO WITH PUBLIC  SAFETY IN THE  STREETS AND ON  THE SUBWAYS.  IF IT'S NOT  SAFE, WORKERS  ARE GOING TO  STAY AWAY.  LOOK AT ALL THE  -- THE WOEFULLY  DISTURBED.  THE HOMELESS  PEOPLE.  WE HAVE TO TAKE  CARE OF THEM.  >> I'M SORRY, WE  HAVE TO MOVE ON  TO A QUESTION OF  YOU.  WHAT IS YOUR BIG  IDEA TO BRING  EMPTY OFFICES TO  --  >> THERE ARE  MANY WORKERS WHO  WILL OPT TO  ACTION TO GET  PAID LESS IN  ORDER TO ENJOY A  BETTER QUALITY  OF LIFE, NOT  JUST IN THE CITY  BUT IN THE OTHER  SURROUNDING TRI- STATE AREAS.  THERE'S NO WAY  TO FORCE THEM TO  COME BACK TO  WORK.  I IMAGINE THEY  ARE GOING TO  TAKE ONE -- WE  HAVE TO LOOK AT  MILLIONS OF  SQUARE FEET  BETTER IN --  COMMERCIAL  SPACE.  WE ARE GOING TO  HAVE TO START  REPURPOSE THING  AND FOR  AFFORDABLE  HOUSING.  LOOK AT THE  HUDSON YARD.  WHAT ARE WE  GOING TO DO,  THERE ARE SO  MANY BUILDINGS  STILL IN  CONSTRUCTION.  THERE ARE NO  TENANTS.  THERE ARE NO  PEOPLE WHO NEED  THAT SPACE.  SO WE BETTER  START  APPROPRIATING A  CONCEPT AND AN  IDEA OF TURNING  IT INTO  AFFORDABLE  HOUSING AND MAKE  UTILIZATION IN  THAT SPACE.  YOU'RE NEVER  GOING TO BE ABLE  TO UTILIZE IT  FOR COMMERCIAL  SPACES ANYMORE.  >> MR. ADAMS,  TODAY THE WHITE  HOUSE STARTED TO  LAY THE  GROUNDWORK TO  VACCINATE -- 5- 11 WITH COVID.  YOU SAID IT  WOULD MANDATE  COVID VACCINES  FOR ALL ELIGIBLE  NEW YORK CITY --  SO HOW WOULD YOU  HANDLE FAMILIES?  OF 30 SECONDS.  >> WELL, THE  GOAL IS CLEAR.  WE HAVE BEEN  FOLLOWING THE  SIGNS OVER AND  OVER AGAIN.  AND I HAVE  STATED AFTER FDA  APPROVAL, THAT'S  VERY IMPORTANT.  REMEMBER THE  FIRST LEVEL OF  VACCINATION CAME  OUT IN EMERGENCY. I'M GOING TO  COMMUNICATE WITH  MY FAMILY  MEMBERS.  I KNOW THAT THIS  IS AN EMOTIONAL  MOMENT FOR SO  MANY.  BUT I'M GOING TO  COMMUNICATE THEM  AND SHOW WHY IT  IS IMPORTANT  THAT WE CANNOT  GO BACK.  >> THAT MR.  ADAMS, THERE  WILL CERTAINLY  UNDOUBTEDLY BE  SOME PARENTS WHO  CHOOSE NOT TO  HAVE THEIR  CHILDREN  VACCINATED.  SO WHAT DOES IT  LOOK LIKE FOR  THOSE CHILDREN?  >> WELL, LET'S  BE CLEAR.  THEY WOULD HAVE  A SUBSTANTIAL,  SMALL NUMBER OF  PEOPLE THAT DID  NOT WANT ANY  VACCINE AT ALL.  AND WE HAVE TO  STILL EDUCATE  THESE CHILDREN.  >> SO WHAT THEY  IT BE A REMOTE  OPTION?  >> I AM OPEN TO  A REMOTE OPTION.  WHATEVER WE  COULD DO TO  EDUCATE OUR  CHILDREN.  >> THANK YOU,  MR. ADAMS.  IS MR. ADAMS  JUST MENTIONED,  THE STATE  ALREADY REQUIRES  STUDENTS TO BE  VACCINATED.  SO WHY NOT  COVID?  >> WELL, I HAVE  THREE SONS IN  THE PUBLIC  SCHOOL SYSTEM.  HIGH SCHOOL, AN  ELEMENTARY  SCHOOL.  AND I SAW WHAT  HAPPENED IN 1.5  YEARS WHEN THEY  WERE FORCED TO  HAVE VIRTUAL  LEARNING AT  HOME.  UNLIKE -- SCHOOL  GETTING THE  TEACHERS AND --  TO DO A GOOD  JOB.  NOTICE, THEY DID  NOT HAVE A  PROBLEM.  NOW, WE ARE  GOING TO KICK  OUT KIDS, SOME  OF THEM WHO WILL  NOT GIVE  VACCINES.  THIS IS THE  SECOND TIME IN  EIGHT YEARS THAT  I ACTUALLY AGREE  WITH BILL DE  BLASIO.  AND NOT TO FORCE  --  >> YOU SEE, BUT  THE QUESTION IS  -- THE QUESTION  WAS NOT ABOUT  WHETHER OR NOT  TO KICK OUT  KIDS.  IT'S ABOUT  WHETHER OR NOT  TO MANDATE THE  VACCINE.  THE QUESTION WAS  WHY THESE OTHER  -- BUT NOT FOR  COVID.  GIVE US A QUICK  ANSWER.  >> WELL, HOW  ABOUT GETTING --  PARENTS INVOLVED  IN THIS PROCESS.  AND BY THE WAY,  WE STILL DO NOT  HAVE MOTOR NOT  OR PFIZER OR  JOHNSON &  JOHNSON APPROVED  AS SAFE FOR OUR  YOUNG KIDS.  >> YOU BOTH  DISAGREE WITH  THAT DECISION  ABOUT GIFTED AND  TALENTED  PROGRAMS.  THEY INCLUDE A  CONTROVERSIAL  EXAM FOR FOUR  YEARS OLD.  WILL YOU KEEP  THE SAME TEST  AND IF SO, HOW  WILL YOU ADDRESS  THE RACIAL  IMBALANCE THAT  RESULTS IN THE  PROCESS?  YOU HAVE 30  SECONDS.  >> NUMBER ONE,  ONLY 2500 SLOTS  AVAILABLE OUT OF  65,000 CHILDREN  IN KINDERGARTEN.  ONE OF THOSE WAS  MY SON.  I SAT IN THE  ASSEMBLY HALL.  HE LOST OUT, HE  DID NOT GET INTO  GIFTED AND  TALENTED.  BUT WE SEEM TO  BE TAKING IT OUT  ON ASIAN  FAMILIES AND  SOUTHEAST ASIAN  FAMILIES BECAUSE  THEY ARE DOING  SO WELL.  WE NEED TO  EXPAND GIFTED  AND TALENTED SO  IT'S IN ALL  SCHOOLS, EVEN IF  ONLY 3 CHILDREN  QUALIFY IN THE  BRONX, THERE  SHOULD BE GIFTED  AND TALENTED IN  ALL SCHOOLS.  >> THIS IS SO  IMPORTANT TO ME.  I DID NOT HAVE A  LEARNING  DISABILITY  DIAGNOSED UNTIL  I GOT TO  COLLEGE.  THAT'S WHY WE  SHOULD NOT ONLY  EXPAND  OPPORTUNITIES  FOR CHILDREN TO  LEARN AND MAKE  SURE THAT EVERY  DISTRICT IN OUR  CITY AND EVERY  ZIP CODE, BUT WE  SHOULD ALSO LOOK  AT THOSE  CHILDREN WHO  LEARN  DIFFERENTLY.  IT DOESN'T MEAN  THAT THEY CAN'T.  WE MUST MAKE  SURE THAT THE  GOPHER  CHILDREN'S  LEARNING  DISABILITIES,  THE OPPORTUNITY  TO GET THEM  THROUGH THE  BARRIERS TO ALL  EDUCATION.  >> YOUR TIME IS  UP.  LET'S CONTINUE  ON THE QUESTION.  WILL YOU KEEP  THE SAME TEST  THAT IS  CURRENTLY USED?  >> I MADE IT  CLEAR THAT WE  NEED TO LOOK AT  THAT EXAM.  I DON'T BELIEVE  IN A FOUR-YEAR- OLD TAKING AN  EXAM SHOULD  DETERMINE THE  REST OF THEIR --  THAT IS  UNACCEPTABLE.  WE'RE GOING TO  MAKE SURE THAT  WE EVALUATE AND  EXPAND  THROUGHOUT THAT  EDUCATIONAL  EXPERIENCE.  >> INSTEAD OF  FOCUSING JUST ON  ACADEMIC  EXCELLENCE, WE  NEED TO FOCUS ON  A MUCH EARLIER  AGE VOCATIONAL  TRAINING.  THERE IS SUCH --  --  >> OKAY, MR.  SCHUMER.  >> I'M GOING TO  FOLLOW THE  RULES.  >> WE ARE  ADHERING TO THE  ROLES, MR.  ADAMS.  BUT I ENCOURAGE  YOU BOTH TO --  LET'S MOVE ON  HERE.  WE HAVE SHORT  ANSWER QUESTIONS  HERE.  SHOULD THIS YEAR  BE LONGER?  >> ABSOLUTELY.  >> LABOR DAY  UNTIL THE END OF  JULY, JULY 30th?  >> THE LONGER  HOURS DURING THE  SCHOOL WEEK OR  EXTENDED TIME  DURING THE  SUMMER, BUT WE  NEED MORE  CLASSROOM TIME.  >> MAYOR DE  BLASIO DECLARED  NEW YORK A  SANCTUARY CITY.  YES OR NO HERE.  WILL YOU  CONTINUE THE  POLICY?  >> YES, WE  SHOULD PROTECT  OUR IMMIGRANTS  DURING THE COVID  -- I BELIEVE WE  NEED TO  CONTINUE.  >> HOW COULD YOU  ROLL OUT ICE?  THEY TRACK DOWN  -- MS-13.  18th STREET,  VICIOUS  PREDATORS.  WE HAVE TO HAVE  COOPERATION WITH  ICE.  >> THINK YOU.  DEMOCRATS AND  REPUBLICANS ARE  LINING UP BEHIND  CANDIDATES FOR  GOVERNOR.  YOU ARE TWO OF  THE MOST  PROMINENT PARTY  MEMBERS IN THE  STATE, SO WHO  GETS YOUR VOTE  FOR GOVERNOR?  >> NO ONE AT  THIS POINT.  IT'S A PRIMARY  PROCESS.  WE WILL SEE HOW  IT TURNS OUT.  >> I'M RUNNING  FOR MAYOR  NOVEMBER 2nd OF  THIS CITY.  THERE'S ONE  PERSON THAT I'VE  ANNOUNCED THIS  FIVE.  IN I THINK WE  CAN ALL AGREE  THAT TRUST IS OF  THE UTMOST  IMPORTANCE TO  VOTERS.  MR. -- YOU HAVE  MANY -- GIVEN  THIS, WHY SHOULD  VOTERS TRUST  YOU?  >> FOR 42 YEARS,  I PROVIDED  PUBLIC SAFETY IN  CITIES  THROUGHOUT THE  WORLD.  I NEVER ASKED  FOR ANYTHING IN  RETURN.  I MADE MISTAKES.  I WAS IMMATURE  AT THE AGE OF  25.  I DID THINGS I  SHOULD NOT HAVE  DONE.  I KNOW MY  OPPONENT, ERIC  ADAMS SIMILARLY  HAS DONE THINGS  THAT HE HAS  APOLOGIZED FOR.  I DID APOLOGIZE  FOR IT.  I BROUGHT IT TO  EVERYBODY'S  ATTENTION AND I  WILL CONTINUE TO  APOLOGIZE FOR  IT.  BUT I'VE EARNED  THE TRUST FOR  NEW YORKERS.  JUST FOLLOW ME  IN THE STREETS.  I'M THE PEOPLE'S  CHOICE.  I AM THERE.  ERIC ADAMS IS  WITH THE ELITES,  TRYING TO LIVE  UP TO THE  KARDASHIANS AT  CLUB ZERO.  COME ON.  COME BACK TO THE  STREETS IN THE  SUBWAYS.  BE WITH THE REAL  PEOPLE.  >> A QUICK  FOLLOW-UP.  YOU SAID THIS  LONG TIME AGO,  BUT LET'S TALK  ABOUT THIS  RECENTLY.  YOU FOUND A GUN,  IS SHOOTING AT  THE UPPER WEST  SIDE.  30 YEARS AGO,  THAT WAS JUST  ABOUT A MONTH  AGO.  I CRAWLED UNDER  -- A MEMBER OF  MY TEAM ALSO  QUESTIONED ERIC  ADAMS'S SERVICE  AS A POLICE  OFFICER.  MY MISTAKE.  I TAKE  RESPONSIBILITY.  >> MR. ADAMS,  SINCE THE  PRIMARY IN JUNE,  YOU CONTINUE TO  RAISE SOME  QUESTIONS ABOUT  WHETHER OR NOT  -- QUESTION  AGAIN HERE IS  WATCHING NEW  YORKERS SHE WAS  HOMELESS OVER  THREE YEARS.  BRINGING -- INTO  TRAUMA.  STILL GIVING THE  SUPPORT THAT HE  NEEDED.  WE ARE PLEASED  TO MOVE FORWARD.  >> THINK YOU,  JUST A QUICK  FOLLOW-UP.  YOU SAID THAT  YOUR BROOKLYN  BROWN'S IN THE  PRIMARY.  ROUGHLY HOW MANY  NIGHTS DO YOU  HAVE THERE IN  THE LAST --  >> I STAY AT --  I LIVE IN  BROOKLYN.  SOMETIMES, I'M  UP AT 4:00, 5:00  AT NIGHT.  THAT'S MY  PRIMARY.  THE NUMBER OF  DAYS THAT I AM  THERE.  >> ERIC ADAMS,  ONE TIME ON  VACATION IN  MONACO.  >> THAT HAD TO  BE DRAGGED OUT  OF YOU THAT YOU  WENT TO MONACO.  WE HAVE TO MOVE  FORWARD.  THANK YOU.  JUST OUTSIDE OF  RIKERS ISLAND.  >> WHAT I ASKED  YOU ABOUT THE  NEXT -- WITH  REMNANTS OF  HURRICANE IDA  NEXT WEEK.  >> PEOPLE WERE  SWIMMING IN THE  SUBWAY -- SO  HERE'S THE  SCENARIO.  AS MAYOR, YOU  LEARN.  APPROACHING 48  HOURS FROM HERE.  SIMILAR OFF  LIGHT.  FIRST OF ALL, WE  SHOULD NOT WAIT  TO PUT -- OUT.  THAT IS A  MISTAKE.  WE DON'T WAIT  UNTIL THE -- OF.  LEVEL ONE, LEVEL  TWO, LEVEL  THREE.  WE WANT TO MAKE  SURE THAT WE  CLOSE WITH  HIGHWAYS.  WE CLOSE WITH --  WE KNOW WHERE  THEY ARE BASED  OFF THE OFFICE.  FINDING PEOPLE  AT THAT TIME.  THAT IS A  CONCERTED PLAN  THAT WE PUT IN  PLACE.  THEY COULD NEVER  HAVE THE  BEGINNING.  BASED ON THE  LEVEL OF THE  THREATS.  WE NEVER KNOW  BEFOREHAND HOW  THEY ARE GOING  TO RESPOND.  LIKE ERIC ADAMS,  OR BILL DE  BLASIO.  WE WERE PROMISED  THE SEAWALL IN  STATEN ISLAND.  STILL WAITING.  5.5 MONTHS.  GLENDALE, IN THE  VILLAGE.  AS WAS MENTIONED  BEFORE THIS  DEBATE,  DRAINAGE.  DiBLASIO NEVER  DID THAT.  GIVEN 3 SECOND  CLIP.  THREE THINGS TO  CLEAN THE CATCH  BASINS IN THE  SEWERS.  THEY BUILD UP  AND THE AREAS  DESIGNATE A  FLOOD ZONE.  >> YES, DAVID,  LET'S BE CLEAR.  SEAWORLD WOULD  NOT HAVE -- BUT  SEEMS TO BE OUT  THERE IF WE KEEP  THINKING  ANTIQUATED  MESSAGES TO AND  -- PROBLEM WITH  PREVENTION TO  GET -- WITH THE  SEAWALL.  WHAT ARE WE  WAITING FOR?  >> ANOTHER  UNRELATED  QUESTION, SOME  OF THOSE WHO  DIED IN  AQUATICS.  WORLD TRAVELS IN  -- ENVIRONMENTS.  MANY ARE HOME TO  OTHER  COMMUNITIES.  MR. ADAMS.  YOU HAVE TALKED  ABOUT BRINGING  THESE  DEPARTMENTS OFF  THE COAST AND  MANAGING THEM.  HOW LONG WILL  THAT TAKE AND  HOW WILL YOU DO  IT?  >> WELL,  CLEARLY, IT  NEEDED TO BE A  COORDINATED  EFFORT.  ALLOCATING THE  FUNDING TO BE  ABLE TO LIVE BY  -- WE CAN'T  AUTOMATICALLY  MOVE AS OFTEN AS  YOU KNOW, WE ARE  HAVING AN  AFFORDABLE  HOUSING CRISIS.  BUT IN THE  MEANTIME, WE  MUST HAVE A REAL  MESSAGE OF  NOTIFYING  CITIZENS ABOUT  DANGEROUS  STORMS.  IS ABOUT  LEGALIZING THESE  APARTMENTS SO WE  DON'T DISPLACE  PEOPLE UNJUSTLY.  >> ERIC ADAMS  HAS BEEN CITED  FOR ILLEGAL  AVERSION IN THE  BASEMENT THAT HE  IS NEVER IN.  LEAD BY EXAMPLE,  ERIC.  >> YOU ARE  AGAINST  LEGALIZING --  FOR PEOPLE WHO  CAN'T AFFORD TO  GO SOMEWHERE  ELSE.  >> THEY CAN ONLY  BE MAKING -- FOR  THE MANAGER OF A  BUILDING THAT  ALLOWS THAT.  AND THEY ARE  DEFINING THOSE  ILLEGALLY.  SO MUCH DANGER,  JUST LIVING ON A  DAY-TO-DAY BASIS. WE CAN START  MOVING THEM  SLOWLY, BUT  SURELY, BECAUSE  OF FIRE, LIVING  NEXT TO THE  BOILER.  NO ONE ESCAPES.  POTENTIAL FLOOD.  WE ARE NOT A  COMPASSIONATE  SOCIETY.  IT'S ALL ABOUT  THE MONEY.  IT'S ALL ABOUT  DEVELOPERS.  JUST WANTING TO  MAKE MONEY.  THE SAME PEOPLE  THAT SUPPORT  ERIC ADAMS.  THEY DO NOT  SUPPORT ME.  BECAUSE I WOULD  FIND THEM.  AND IF  NECESSARY, PUT  THEM IN JAIL.  MR. ADAMS, IF  YOU WANTED TO  QUICKLY RESPOND.  >> FAIR ENOUGH.  WE'RE GOING TO  MOVE ON.  THE NEXT MAYOR  WILL INHERIT THE  CRISIS OF RIKERS  ISLAND.  CAN YOU MAKE --  HERE IS MANY  CORRECTIONAL  OFFICERS DO NOT  SHOW UP TO WORK,  THERE'S A PLAN  CLOSED FOR  FACILITIES THAT  ARE A LONG WAY  OFF.  MR. ADAMS, DO  YOU SUPPORT  CLOSING RIKERS?  WHAT ARE YOU  PREPARED TO DO  MORE IMMEDIATELY  ON DAY ONE?  >> I GUESS IT'S  -- A PLAN WITH  PLEASING OF THE  NEW JAILS.  TO MAKE SURE  THAT WE COME  DOWN THROUGH --  WITH THE  LOCATION.  RIGHT NOW, WE  NEED TO RESPOND  TO THE NEEDS OF  NOT ONLY THE  INMATES THAT ARE  THERE, BUT ALSO  THE CORRECTIONS  OFFICERS.  SOMETIMES, WE  FORGET THAT  THESE OFFICERS  HAVE BEEN  WARNING US FOR  YEARS.  MANY OF THEM,  BLACK AND BROWN  WOMEN.  -- THROWN ON  THEM.  ASSAULTED HERE  CAN BE IN.  MANY OF THE  CELLBLOCKS GOING  WITHOUT ANY  GUARDS AT ALL.  SO WHAT WE MUST  REALLY DO, STOP  THE BOTTLENECK.  THOSE THAT ARE  GOING TO COURT,  LET'S KEEP IT IN  COURT.  WHETHER THEY ARE  INNOCENT OR THEY  CAN SERVE THEIR  TIME LIKE THEY  ARE SUPPOSED TO  DO.  AND THEN,  IMMEDIATELY,  >> THINK YOU,  MR. ADAMS.  YOU ARE OPPOSING  IT.  AS MAYOR, HOW  WILL YOU GET THE  SITUATION IN ONE  MINUTE.  >> I AM LIKE  ERIC ADAMS ALIA,  REFUSED TO GO  OFF -- NOT ONE  CORRECTIONAL  OFFICER WAS  MISSING ONE CELL. THAT'S WHAT I'M  SAYING, THE  WARNING HOUSE.  HAS TO BE THE  HEALTH ANNE  STATE -- THE  TOUGHEST JOB IN  THE CITY.  BOUNCING THE  CORRECTIONAL  OFFICERS THAT WE  NEED.  THE EMOTIONALLY  DISTURBED  INMATES TO STATE  FACILITIES FOR  MENTAL HEALTH  AND MEDICATION.  THEY SHOULD NOT  BE ON RIKERS AND  THE GANG BANGERS  KNOW THIS,  BECAUSE I KNOW  THE GAMES.  THEY ARE ALL  GOING TO BE  DIVIDED UP.  -- WILL NOT BE  HOUSED.  BLOODS, AND ALL  WITH BLISS.  CRIP, NOT WITH  CRIPS.  EARLIER THIS  MONTH, A  MENTALLY ILL  WOMAN WHO HAD  BEEN ARREST DID  SEVERAL TIMES  PUSHED A SUBWAY  WRITER INTO A  MOVING TRAIN IN  TIMES SQUARE .  IT'S IS ONE  EXAMPLE OF A  BROKEN MENTAL  HEALTH SYSTEM  THAT'S BECOME A  REVOLVING DOOR.  PEOPLE TAKEN OFF  THE STREET AND  THEN SENT BACK  WITHOUT GETTING  ANY OF THE HOPE  THAT THEY NEED.  WHAT IS ONE  THING THAT SHE  WOULD DO  SPECIFICALLY TO  FIX THE MENTAL  HEALTH SYSTEM?  YOU HAVE ONE  MINUTE.  >> I WOULD  INVESTIGATE THE  ORGANIZATION  CALLED THRIVE.  PUT TOGETHER BY  BILL DE BLASIO,  WITH NO  CREDIBILITY IN  THIS FIELD DAY  ONE IN CITY  HALL, AND WE ARE  GOING TO HAVE  ATTENTION TO --  GETTING THE  MEDICINE THAT  THEY NEED.  TODAY, I WAS A  GUY I WAS WITH A  GUY NAMED CHRIS.  CAN GO TO  COURTESY -- LOOK  AT THE FACEBOOK  PAGE.  YOU WILL SEEM I  CAME TO HIS AID,  COMFORTING HIM.  TO BE CLEAR,  UNDER STATE LAW,  -- CANNOT BE  PLACED IN MENTAL  HEALTH  FACILITIES AS AN  IMMINENT THREAT.  SO MR. ADAMS, DO  YOU THINK THAT  STANDARD NEEDS  TO BE CHANGED?  YOU HAVE ONE  MINUTE.  WHAT I'M GOING  TO DO IN MY PLAN  IS ENSURE THAT  -- WHERE THEY  ARE ABLE TO GIVE  WE GIVE THEM THE  SUPPORT AND  FINANCES THAT  THEY NEED.  >> WE CAN'T LET  THIS STAY OFF  THE HOOK.  GOVERNOR --  TAKING OFF FOR  CUOMO.  WHEN HE CAME  INTO OFFICE.  >> ARE YOU  SAYING THAT THE  STANDARD SHOULD  BE CHANGED?  >> ARE YOU  SAYING THE  STANDARD SHOULD  BE CHANGED UNDER  STATE LAW?  >> YES, MR.  ADAMS,  HOMELESSNESS AND  -- ARE OFTEN  INTERTWINED.  WE WENT TO  CONVERT 25,000  TO SUPPORT  ALTERNATIVE  HOUSING.  SAY THAT THOSE  SHOULD NOT BE  CREATED.  SO MY QUESTION  IS, WHY NOT  MANHATTAN GIVEN  THE THAT'S WHERE  -- THAT'S WHERE  WE ARE TALKING  ABOUT BEING IN  SHELTERS.  GOING UP IN  QUEENS.  THAT I HAVE A  REAL APARTMENTS.  ARE THERE ENOUGH  AVAILABLE HOTEL  ROOMS?  >> OF COURSE,  EVEN WHEN  TOURISM RETURNS  IN MANHATTAN.  WE ARE TRYING TO  BE BUILT OUT OF  THE SHELF IN A  -- COMMUNITY.  >> THANK YOU,  MR. --  >> YOU, ERIC  ADAMS SAYS THAT  SHE WANTED TO  KEEP OFF THE --  >> WE HAVE  VOTING AREAS.  WE HAVE TO  CHANGE THE  ZONING LAWS AND  THE MANY EMPTY  COMMERCIAL SPACES STILL BEING  BUILT THAT WILL  NOT BE ABLE TO  HOUSE ANYONE.  REPURPOSING IT  FOR AFFORDABLE  HOUSING.  FOR MEN AND  WOMEN THAT HAVE  THE WHOLE  ADDICTION AND  DRUG ADDICTION.  >> THEY HAVE  INDICATED -- IS  ON.  NEW YORKERS ARE  FINDING -- MANY  ARE EMBRACED AND  PUSHED.  HOW TO BALANCE  THE INTRINSIC --  YOU HAVE ONE  MINUTE.  IT'S QUITE  POSSIBLE.  EVERYBODY KNOWS  THAT I ENJOY  WRITING MY BIKE.  THE CITY TO STOP  THE TRAFFIC --  THAT WAS REALLY  IMPACTING A LOT  OF PEOPLE.  FAMILIES IN THE  INDUSTRY SO MANY  TIMES AND OTHER  ORGANIZATIONS.  WE REALLY WANT  TO LOOK AFTER  SOME OF THE  ILLEGAL CRUCIAL  TO MEET -- WILL  YOU BALANCE IN  THE NEW WORLD  WITH SAFETY  CONCERNS?  >> WE HAVE ONCE  AGAIN ENERGIZED  OFF THE  PROACTIVE AREA.  ALONG WITH THE  TRAFFIC CONTROL  AGENCY.  AND THE NYPD.  THEY ARE  SPEEDING THROUGH  BIKE LANES.  I CAN'T TELL YOU  HOW MANY PEOPLE,  SOCIALLY ELDERLY  PEOPLE WHO HAVE  BEEN HIT OR  KNOCKED DOWN OR  TRAUMATIZED, WHO  CANNOT GO  OUTSIDE NOW  BECAUSE  BASICALLY IT'S  ONE BIG RODEO  OUT THERE  BECAUSE WE DON'T  ALLOW OUR  POLICE.  DiMAGGIO WILL  NOT ALLOW OUR  POLICE TO GET  PROACTIVELY  INVOLVED.  I'M GOING TO  INSIST, YOU GO  OUT THERE, YOU  SEE THOSE  ILLEGAL VIDEOS.  YOU FIND THESE  INDIVIDUALS, YOU  MAKE SURE THAT  THEY HAVE BEEN  ARRESTED AND  PROSECUTED  BECAUSE THEY  TAKE CONTROL OF  -- IF THEY ARE  RELATED TO THE  COMMUTE AT ALL,  MOVING FORWARD  WITH A PLAN  TRAVELING SOUTH.  SUPPORTERS SAY  CRITICS SAY IT'S  AN UNFAIR  BURDEN.  IT WILL KEEP  PEOPLE OUT OF  MANHATTAN.  MR. ADAMS,  STOPPING THIS.  SUPPORT FROM  CITY HALL DOES  MATTER.  SUPPORTING -- WE  NEED TO INVEST  IN THE FIRST  CLASS -- WE  SHOULD ALSO HAVE  WAIVERS FOR  THOSE WHO MUST  GO INTO  CHEMOTHERAPY AND  OTHER THINGS  LIKE THAT.  THEY HAVE BEEN  INSTRUCTED TO  DELIVER THEIR  SUPPLIES 8:00  A.M.  TO 6:00 P.M.  I BELIEVE THAT  WE HAVE TO DEAL  WITH -- IN OUR  CITIES, GETTING  A LARGE AMOUNT  OF MONEY.  >> COMING IN  FROM STATEN,  BROOKLYN,  QUEENS, HOW  ABOUT WE DO  SOMETHING?  STOP BELIEVING  THESE  POLITICIANS LIKE  ERIC ADAMS, BILL  DE BLASIO  BECAUSE I TRUST  PEOPLE.  I DON'T TRUST  POLITICIANS.  LET THE PEOPLE  DECIDE.  I THINK YOU WILL  HAVE TO GIVE A  REDUCED  SUGGESTION  PRICING SYSTEM  FOR BOROUGH  RESIDENTS AS  OPPOSED TO THOSE  PEOPLE COMING IN  FROM WEST JESUP.  >> OKAY, LET ME  ASK YOU ABOUT  STREET VENDOR  ENFORCEMENT  ACROSS THE CITY  HAS SEEN A  DRAMATIC  INCREASE.  BRICK AND MORTAR  STORES  COMPLAINED THAT  THIS HURTS THEIR  BUSINESS.  ADVOCATES SAY  THAT THOSE HAVE  BEEN HEAVY- HANDED SPOTS.  HOW DO YOU GET A  HANDLE ON THIS?  >> LISTEN, I WAS  A STREET VENDOR  AS A KID.  RENTING THE  HOUSE TO HELP  MOTHER PURCHASED  GROCERIES FOR MY  FIVE SIBLINGS.  THERE'S THE  BALANCE HERE.  NUMBER ONE,  INCREASE THE  NUMBER OF  BUSINESSES THAT  WE ARE GIVING TO  THE STREET  BUSINESS.  WE SHOULD ALSO  FIND LOCATIONS  WHERE THEY CAN  VENT AND THEY  ARE ABLE TO SELL  THEIR GOODS.  WE SHOULD NEVER  ALLOW WHAT  HAPPENED SEVERAL  WEEKS AGO, WHEN  WE THROUGHOUT --  PRODUCE.  >> THANK YOU,  MR. ADAMS.  >> HOW  INTERESTING.  WHEN THEY TEACH  -- TO THE POLICE  BY $5 MILLION,  THEY REMOVE THE  -- THAT WOULD GO  AROUND AND  ESPECIALLY HAVE  THE KNOCKOFF  GUCCI, YOU GO ON  CANAL STREET.  IT'S JUST ONE  ILLEGAL SALE OF  ILLEGAL ITEMS  THAT IS HURTING  THE BRICK AND  MORTAR STORES.  THE SMALL  BUSINESSES, AND  YET, YOU DO NOT  SEE THEM ON  FIFTH AVENUE.  HOW IS IT THAT  THE WEALTHY, THE  RICH, THE ELITE  ARE PROTECT  BEING OUR FIFTH  AVENUE.  SOME OF THE  BENEFACTORS AND  SUPPORTERS, I  SAY NO NO NO NO.  YOU HAVE TO REIN  THEM IN.  IN IOWA TO ASK  YOU ABOUT A VERY  STRESSFUL  SITUATION FOR  THE ELDERLY  POPULATION,  HOUSING.  IN THE CRISIS  FOR HUNDREDS OF  THOUSANDS IN THE  FUTURE.  STUDIES HAVE  SHOWN THAT MANY  ARE PAYING TWO  THIRDS OF THEIR  INCOME ON RENT.  WHAT WILL YOU DO  TO SOLVE THIS  AND MAKE HOUSING  MORE AFFORDABLE?  >> ALL RIGHT,  400,000  RESIDENTS IN 19  FACILITIES AS AN  INCREDIBLE  NUMBER.  I'VE BEEN AFTER  SO MANY OF THE  DIFFERENT  HOUSING PROJECT  IN WHICH -- WE  HAVE TO GIVE  THEM 10  ADVANTAGES.  WE HAVE TO GIVE  THEM THE ABILITY  TO -- WHO ARE  BEING THREATENED  WITH EVICTION  AND OTHER AREAS  THAT THEY LIVE  WITH.  TO DOWNSIDE.  MR. ADAMS, MR.  -- WE HAVE HEARD  PLENTY FROM YOU  TODAY ABOUT WHAT  IS WRONG WITH  NEW YORK CITY  RIGHT NOW.  THE PART OF  AMERICA'S JOB IS  BEING A  CHEERLEADER.  WE HAVE TO SEE  HOW GOOD YOU ARE  AT BEING NEW  YORK'S PITCH  MATCH.  WE ALSO HAVE A  SECRET WEAPON.  WE HAVE SOME OF  THE MOST FRESH  IDEAS.  THAT YOU COULD  MOVE AROUND THE  CITY FOR THE  GREAT MINDS OF  THE FUTURE.'S  THERE'S SO MUCH  TO DO HERE.  YOU WILL BE  BORING IN  FLORIDA.  THANK YOU, MR.  ADAMS.  SAME QUESTION TO  YOU.  WE WANT TO HEAR  YOU BE POSITIVE,  SO LOOK INTO  THAT CAMERA.  WHY SHOULD  PEOPLE COME  BACK?  >> LET ME GET  THIS STRAIGHT,  ERIC ADAMS WENT  INTO FLORIDA.  HEY, I'M GOING  -- WAIT A  SECOND, YOU SAID  YOU'RE GOING TO  PUERTO RICO AND  THE DOMINICAN  REPUBLIC ON  JANUARY 2nd.  COME ON, ERIC.  YOU CANNOT BE IN  THREE PLACES AT  ONE TIME.  HOW ABOUT  STAYING HERE IN  NEW YORK CITY  AND HELPING  PEOPLE, KEEP THE  PEOPLE WHO ARE  ALREADY HERE.  >> I THINK THIS  IS A PITCH TO  NEW YORKERS.  NOT TO THE  POLICE  DEPARTMENT.  >> WE HAVE THE  MOST MARVELOUS  PARTS IN THE  OUTER BOROUGHS  AND ACTUALLY --  OF ANY CITY THAT  I HAVE EVER BEEN  IN THE WORLD.  YOU GET ELECTED  MAYOR, CITY OF  NEW YORK.  >> ALL RIGHT.  YOU WANT TO  BRING -- WE HAVE  TWO QUICK  QUESTIONS.  WE ARE ALMOST  OUT OF TIME.  SOME OTHER  ISSUES ON  CARRIAGE FORCES.  >> ABSOLUTELY.  I WOULD BE -- SO  DRIVERS THAT I  HAVE WORKED WITH  ELECTRIC  CARRIAGES.  WE HAVE TO STOP  THIS BARBARIC  BEHAVIOR.  >> I'M GOING TO  -- WITH THOSE  DRIVERS TO FIND  A BETTER WAY  AROUND -- ONE  THING I AM NOT  GOING TO DO IS -- HOW ABOUT  INTERVIEWING  LATINOS.  WE WANT YOU TO  MAKE SURE THAT  WE HAD TO CHECK  THE WEBSITE.  IT HAS SOME  IMPORTANT  INFORMATION  ABOUT THE  CANDIDATES.  FROM W IN BC,  POLITICO.
