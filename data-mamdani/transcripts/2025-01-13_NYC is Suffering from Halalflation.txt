New York is suffering from a crisis and it's called Halal flation today we're going to get to the bottom of this how much does the plate of Halal cost right now from this truck $10 $10 chicken $10 $10 yeah when you're a street vendor you have to pay for the food the plates how much do you have to pay for your permit before it was 22k 20 17,000 how much does a license cost if you get it from the city I think uh 400 and who are you paying the permit owner you're not paying the city no no no you pay the permit owner $22,000 just so you can sell this food yes and who is this a random guy have you ever applied for a permit yeah I'm obled and no come anything it's long wait um number 3,800 something and after 2 years you're number 3,800 yes these are the four builds that are sitting in the city council right now which would give these vendors their own permits and make your Halal more affordable But Eric Adams hasn't said a single word about them if you own the permit then how much would you charge for the plate $7 $8 $8 would you rather pay $10 for a plate of Halal or $8 $8 $8 I think $8 is the way to go if I was the mayor I'd be working with city council from day one to make Halal eight bucks again so how was it taste tastes like 10 bucks but a should be eight
