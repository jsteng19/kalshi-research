================================================================================

We have just begun our walk through the entirety of Manhattan. We're at Inwood Hill Park at the tiptop. We're outside because New Yorkers deserve a mayor that they can see, they can hear, they can even yell at. Good, bro. Election's on Tuesday. Tuesday. Thank you, my brother. Everybody contain to my friend. 24 million. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Thank you, brother. Yes. You know that. You know that. Only the greatness. You know what I'm saying? When we launched this campaign on a cold October evening, few thought we could win. Thank you, my man. I'll see you. But I always knew that we would build a campaign just like this. Just vote today. Just vote today. Yes. [Applause] Vote for you. Over a million doors knocked. More than 40,000 volunteers. You are the beating heart of this campaign. [Applause] [Music] Yes, of course. Thank you. [Music] Oh my god. I just voted for him. You got to win. You got to stay with this, brother. Thank you so much. You got this. I appreciate it. You have climbed six floor walkups and braved the pouring rain to canvas our city. Wait, we both have canvas for you. Can't wait to have you here. You have shared our message with the very New Yorkers you've lived alongside for years, but never had the chance to meet. And make no mistake, this campaign is reaching every corner of this city. [Music] Oh my gosh. I love you. To everyone who pulls me aside to whisper with the best intentions, you have already won. I am sorry, but the days of moral victories are over because this is a campaign that is going to win on June 24th. [Music] And it's thanks to each and every one of you. All right. Where are we headed?
