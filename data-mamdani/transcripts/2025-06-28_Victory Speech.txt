[Applause] In the words of Nelson Mandela, it always seems impossible until it is done. My friends, we have done it. I will be your Democratic nominee for the mayor of New York City. We have won from Harlem to Bay Rich, from Jackson Heights to Port Richmond. We have won because New Yorkers have stood up for a city they can afford. A city where they can do more than just struggle. Where hard work is repaid with a stable life. Where rent stabilized apartments are actually stabilized. Where buses are fast and free. Where child care doesn't cost more than. And where public safety keeps us truly safe. And it's where the mayor will use their power to reject Donald Trump's fascism to stop mass ICE agents from deporting our neighbor to govern our city as a model for the Democratic Party. A party where we fight for working people with no apology. A life of dignity should not be reserved for a fortunate few. It should be one that city government guarantees for each and every New Yorker. And when I think of hope, I think of the unprecedented coalition of New Yorkers that we have built. This is not my victory. This is ours. And when I look out at this room, that is what I see. Children who called parents, strangers who care about those they will never meet. a New York that believes in each other and in itself. This has been a historically contentious race. I hope now that this primary has come to an end. I can introduce myself once more. Not as you've seen me in a 30-cond ad, but how I will lead as your mayor. I will be the mayor for every New Yorker. Whether you voted for me, for Governor Cuomo, or felt too disillusioned by a long broken political system to vote at all, I will fight for a city that works for you, that is affordable for you, that is safe for you. I will work to be a mayor. You will be proud to call your own. I cannot promise that you will always agree with me, but I will never hide from you. If you are hurting, I will try to heal. If you feel misunderstood, I will strive to understand. Your concerns will always be mine, and I will put your hopes before my own. And I know that those hopes extend beyond our five burrows. There are millions of New Yorkers who have strong feelings about what happens overseas. Yes, I am one of them. And while I will not abandon my beliefs or my commitments, grounded in a demand for equality for humanity, for all those who walk this earth, you have you have my word to reach further to understand the perspectives of those with whom I disagree and to wrestle deeply with those disagreements. ments. Let me close with this. In these dark times, I know that it is harder than ever to keep faith in our democracy. It has been attacked by billionaires and their big spending, by elected officials who care more about self-enrichment than the public trust, and by authoritarian leaders who rule through fear. New York. But above all, our democracy has been attacked from within. For too long, New Yorkers have strained to find a leader who represents us, who puts us first. And we have been betrayed time and again. And when we no longer believe in our democracy, it only becomes easier for people like Donald Trump to convince us of his worth. for billionaires to convince us that they must always lead. As FDR said, democracy has disappeared in several other great nations, not because the people disliked democracy, but because they had grown tired of unemployment and insecurity, of seeing their children hungry while they sat helpless in the face of government confusion and weakness. In desperation, they chose to sacrifice liberty in the hope of getting something to eat. New York, if we have made one thing clear over these past months, it is that we need not choose between the two. We can be free and we can be fed. We can demand what we deserve. And I pledge to you that we will remake this great city. Not in my image, but in the image of every New Yorker who has only known struggle. In our New York, the power belongs to the people. We dreamt in the night and we are now building in the dawn that new day. The one that we have struggled for. The one that we have knocked for, have texted for, have called for. The one that we have obsessed over. That new day is finally here. My And it is here because you have delivered it. Come daddy. Come daddy. Come daddy. Come daddy.
