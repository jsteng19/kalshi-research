We stand on the verge of a victory that will resonate across the country and the world. Make no mistake, this victory will be historic not just because of who I am, a Muslim immigrant and a proud democratic socialist, but for what we will do. Make this city affordable for everyone. Because after this rally, as many of us sleep, millions of our neighbors will step out onto moonlit streets across our city. Nurses working the night shift will put on their scrubs and save lives. Office buildings will be made new again as the midnight shift scrubs and polishes in the dark. And even more, New Yorkers will spend the entire night tirelessly working and return home carrying the burden that it still isn't enough. If New York truly is the city that never sleeps, we deserve a mayor who fights for those of us who labor at every single hour of the day. I will be that mayor. And I will be a mayor who doesn't bow down to corporate interests, doesn't take his orders from billionaires, and sure as hell doesn't let ICE steal our neighbors from their homes. There are no kings in America, whether that's Donald Trump, Andrew Cuomo, or the Republican billionaires who fund both of their campaigns, because this is a campaign that is going to win on June 24th. And it's thanks to each and every one of you on election night after the polls have closed and the results have come in. We will go home. And as we close our eyes, the days of countless others will only be beginning. Doors in Jackson Heights and Parkchester and Bay Ridge and Sound View will open at midnight. New Yorkers will leave their homes and commute under street lights to work, where they'll drive buses and mop floors and bake bread. For some, this will feel like any other night. But for so many more, it will feel like the dawn of a new day because we, my friends, are going to win the city we deserve. And it's going to be one we can afford, one where we can dream again. And for that, I must say, thank you.
