I'm standing here on West 83rd Street in front of a building owned by one of the worst landlords in New York City it has racked up hundreds of code violations after years of neglect and ongoing pressure from tenants the city finally stepped in and sued the landlord but even that didn't fix these issues we are talking about a lack of heat a lack of hot water and instead leaks rats a literal beehive in the wall housing isn't just more expensive than ever it's falling apart but what's mayor Adams doing about this the same thing as his real estate donors nothing that's why I'm announcing a plan to overhaul the mayor's office to protect tenants bringing code enforcement Under One Roof and making sure that agencies are working together to hold bad landlords accountable starting on day one we will expand the city's special enforcement programs doubling fines for hazardous violations and tripling them for conditions that are immediately dangerous and when a really bad landlord like this guy refuses to fix it the city's going to step in make the repairs and send them the bill if that doesn't work the city's taking over the building we're putting the worst landlords out of business and we're going to transform 311 by bringing the latest and cuttingedge Technology scheduling appointments with inspectors so you actually know when they're showing up to your apartment and the best part you're going to pay for this but actually bad landlords are going to pay for this we're going to fund this expanded enforcement in the most obvious Way by actually collecting the fines and enforcing the violations the Adams Administration has spent 4 years ignoring everybody says housing is a human right let's start acting like it
