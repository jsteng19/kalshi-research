Hey. Hey. Good morning. How's it going? Please go second. No, I insist you go second. How about I go first and you go second? Well, we both love New York City. And that's why it's so important to not send scandalridden, corrupt Andrew Cuomo to city hall. New Yorkers deserve so much better than a disgraced creep. Agreed. Zoran, you've done a remarkable job building a historic grassroots campaign for a New York City all New Yorkers can afford. Brad, you've been a principled progressive leader in our city for years. Early voting starts tomorrow and we both know what we need to do to save our city from Andrew Cuomo. You want to tell him? You go first. Yeah, you go first. Let's do it together. We're crossoring. In New York City, we have rank choice voting. That means you can rank up to five candidates for mayor. Brad and I are officially telling our supporters number one. Zoron number two. Let's send Andrew Cuomo back to the suburbs.
