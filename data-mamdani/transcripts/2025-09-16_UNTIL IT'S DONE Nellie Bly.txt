I'm on Roosevelt Island, or as it was called in 1887, Blackwells Island, near what used to be the New York City Mental Health Hospital. 138 years ago this month, Nelly Bllye arrived here, deep undercover. An intrepid investigative journalist at a time when women were told they couldn't work men's jobs. She had spent months applying for reporting roles. The only publication that would hire her, The New York World, gave her a daunting assignment. She was to feain mental illness, to shine a light on a dark underbelly of the city, the hidden facilities where the mentally ill received treatment. Bllye arrived on Blackwell's Island with the knowledge that there was no plan to get her out. For 10 days, she ate spoiled food, watched as nurses beat and choked patients, and braved bone chilling cold. When she was finally released, she wrote a searing expose that achieved what was previously judged impossible, a systemic overhaul of how the most vulnerable in our society were treated. New York set aside a million dollars for reforms, the equivalent of 35 million today. And when she returned to this island a month later, she found a hospital that had changed its ways. Nelly Blly's time has long passed, but the challenges she dared to investigate endure. New Yorkers with severe mental illness have been failed by a system that often seeks to push them out of view rather than support it. Just as those in Nelly Blly's era dismiss the idea of mental health care without misery as impossible, many of the most cynical among us today think it's only possible to address severe mental illness through criminalization, not compassion. New Yorkers know that we can do better by each other. But we have to do things differently. As mayor, I want to challenge what conventional wisdom deems possible. and we'll do so with our new Department of Community Safety. Our unprecedented $362 million investment in mental health services will prioritize preventative and ongoing care, which is proven to make the most enduring impact. We'll support peer-led mental health clubouses and supportive housing, grow outreach efforts on the subway, and deploy mental health professionals to address the mental health crisis, not ask police officers to take on yet another job. This is how we deliver lasting improvements and it's how we look out for one another. Nelly Bllye wrote, "It is only after one is in trouble that one realizes how little sympathy and kindness there are in the world. There are too many of our fellow New Yorkers in trouble. Their days filled with fear. Together, we can reform our mental health care system and build a city where every New Yorker can live a life of dignity. [Music]
