in New York City a deeply blue stronghold Donald Trump gained nearly 100,000 more voters than he did in 2020 meanwhile almost 600,000 fewer New Yorkers turned out for Harris than they did for Joe Biden so what is going on here local Reports say voters pointed to three issues crime immigration and the economy now these numbers might look surprising but they didn't come out of nowhere we saw a slight red shift in the 2022 midterms with many blaming postp pandemic pain similar issues were at Play crime in New York City is actually lower than many voters think it is but fear-mongering persists a Vox columnist wrote earlier this year that part of the problem is how Democrats are responding to declining crime rates they tried to look tougher on crime than Republicans instead of pointing to Credible data and this wasn't just about crime the same tactic applies to immigration and other issues like inflation and for those who didn't vote speculation points to disillusionment with Democrats or the over the war in Gaza as a possible reason joining us now to discuss this is New York State Assembly member Zoran mamdani who's also running for mayor against the incumbent Eric Adams uh it's great to have you uh with us nice to meet you in person let me uh get your reaction to something that a democratic congressman from New York said this is Congressman Richie Torres who tweeted out Donald Trump has no greater friend than the far-left which has managed to alienate historic numbers of Latinos blacks Asians and Jews from the Democratic party with absurdities like defund the police or from the river to to the c or Latin X I want to give you a chance just to respond to that broad uh takeaway from someone who is a democratic um uh party member here in New York City I think Richie Torres probably had that in the drafts of his Twitter long before this election and was waiting for an opportunity to just confirm his prior sentiments what I've found instead today spending the day on Hillside Avenue in Queens and on forom Road in the Bronx two areas that saw the strongest shifts towards Donald Trump and even larger numbers of Voters who just didn't out at all is that voters were primarily motivated by the economy by a rising cost of living crisis and by despair over to continue genocide in Gaza so how uh does New York begin to change that I mean your constituency is in New York uh in Queens I should note um it had some of the sharpest uh shifts to the red what is it that you think can be done at this level to address these issues I think the first thing we have to do is the bare minimum which is address the fact that they are real for too many New Yorkers when they went to cast their vote on Tuesday or didn't cast them at all they didn't see the pain of their day-to-day lives on that ballot they didn't see it in the Democratic party and we have to understand that while Tuesday is being seen as a referendum on the economy and immigration it's not just a national issue it's also here locally Eric Adams has taken almost every opportunity to exacerbate a cost of living crisis and has blamed immigrants and Asylum Seekers saying that we could destroy this city so when you see that kind of leadership from our arguably the second largest bully pulpit in America it's no surprise to see these kinds of shifts take place across the five burrows you bring up a good point about the fact that New York City is kind of even though it's even though it is a city uh position it is a national position probably the most high-profile mayoral position anywhere in the world I'm going to come to that in just a second but let me just put a finer point on the on the presidential election um 600,000 people less turned out for the Vice President in New York City how do you explain that in a in a very strong blue City I think it's a symptom of Despair you know what we've seen as much as we try and tell people that this is a strong economy that unemployment is very low more than half of all New Yorkers give over a majority of their paycheck to a landlord or a bank every month 500,000 of our children 500,000 of our children can't even afford enough food to eat and we're seeing eviction surge homelessness surge all of this amidst a rising cost of living crisis in every facet of people's lives they want to see an affirmative Vision that will not just recognize that but Rectify it and if they don't they will stay home so the the coming back to now the mayor Mayoral race here in New York there is this debate within the Democratic party as to whether or not the party has shifted too far to the left and needs to come back to the center um and others are saying no you need to actually move to the left on economic populist positions things that are advocated by people like Bernie Sanders and others even surprisingly somebody like Chris Murphy today senator from Connecticut not exactly someone you think of as being on the left and Democratic politics but where do you come down on this debate and what it prends for New York a city that has extremes on both sides you definitely have a very strong workingclass base but you also have Wall Street and you have the financial capital of the world here in New York I think the problem is is that in New York City the Democratic party is more closely associated now with Wall Street than it is the working class and you know we see nationally 70% of Americans think that the economic system is rigged by special interests if we do not name those special interests institutions that are benefiting from this moment we leave the door open to Someone Like Donald Trump blaming individuals instead individuals like immigrants and Asylum Seekers I believe that what New Yorkers deserves and Americans deserve is a politics that centers the working class it's why in this run for mayor that I've begun about two weeks ago we have launched with a pledge to freeze the rent for every rent stabilized tenant to make buses fast and free for the million New Yorkers who ride them every day and to make Universal Child Care a reality for every New Yorker at no cost to them no matter if their child is 6 weeks or 5 years of age and how do you pay for that when you look at a city like right now that has broken roads the subway is not working it does not feel safe for a lot of people and again the perception of safety versus the reality of safety two very different things New York is the largest safest city in the world and yet sometimes it people perceive it to be very dangerous well because we have a mayor who continues to tell people that it is too dangerous until he realize that it was bring down his own polling numbers you know I think there are two ways that we pay for this the first is better management of what we spend our money on we have Eric Adams who's spending our money on robot dogs and robots to patrol Time Square subway station we could be spending that money to actually benefit the working class and then we can raise taxes on the wealthiest New Yorkers and the wealthiest corporations that do business in New York because we know that if we don't we will continue to lose New Yorkers because of the very crisis of cost of living that's taking place across the city all right um as AR MD it's a pleasure to speak to you I look forward to speaking to you many more times uh as this race heats up thank you so much for having me and if you're more interested in this race check us out at zahan nc.com thank you appreciate it
