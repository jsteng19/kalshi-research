Being a politician means listening not just to your supporters but your critics too. And some of these critics, especially on a certain website, have been giving me consistent advice. For example, Sam White087. Zoron, go back to Uganda where you come from and belong. Teflon gone, loser, go back to Africa. There are thousands like this from across the country. I hear you and I agree. I'm going back to Uganda. I'm headed there in a personal capacity to celebrate Rama and I's marriage with our family and friends. But I do want to apologize to the haters because I will be coming back. And since you will undoubtedly read about this trip in the New York Post, inshallah on the front page, here are a few of my humble suggestions for headlines. Mia Mamani in Africa. Uganda miss me. He's compalitly crazy. The Afra can't be serious. Carl Kalanili investigates Mamani. Zo running away.
