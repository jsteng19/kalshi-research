thank you to everyone who is here to honor the lives of the 15,000 New Yorkers who lost their lives and as we make it clear that these are not just numbers these are not just names these are New Yorkers in each of whom was an entire universe and we cannot turn the page back to March 25th of 2020 but we can ask ourselves how can these families heal how can we move forward how can we ensure that these mistakes are not repeated and it always brings us back to the importance of honesty of accountability and of an apology these are the basic requirements of leadership and yet somehow for our former Governor they are things beyond that which he is willing to do and as we think about these New Yorkers and as we think about the prospect of another pandemic in the future these qualities of leadership become all the more important and as has been said by the arini family this is not about politics this is about leadership this is about New York City this is about ensuring we can honor those that we have lost and protect those that we still have and yet the choice that is being given to New Yorkers is still including a man Andrew Cuomo for whom himself and his mythology is more important than anything these families are asking and I call on our former Governor to answer the calls of these families to apologize for the mistakes that he made in the the pandemic and to show himself worthy of the same accountability that we want every single leader to be open to
