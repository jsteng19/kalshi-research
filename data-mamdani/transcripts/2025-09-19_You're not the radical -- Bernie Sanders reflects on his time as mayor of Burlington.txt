Bernie Senator. Hello. [Music] So many people know you as a senator, as a presidential candidate, but you were also a mayor for eight years. Eight years. Four terms. Ronald Reagan had just won the presidency. He had even won Vermont. And yet there you were as a Democratic socialist deciding to run for mayor. What made you make that decision? I think Reagan was part of it. We had come off of the war in Vietnam some years before. Serious economic problems. The needs of working-class and low-income communities have been ignored. Here's a radical idea. All right. I don't want anyone to listen. We paid attention to the needs of the people. I know I Oh, God. Radical idea. In other words, don't just talk to your staff or your administrators. Go out in the streets. Talk to people. The people on the front lines will say, "These are the real problems that we have in Vermont. We get a lot of snow." Mhm. So we made sure that snow removal took place in low-income working-class neighborhoods. Street repaving. We talked to women's groups. Board of all them was almost all male, not quite, but heavily male. We had meetings with hundreds of parents. And then a week before the election, we talked to the Burlington Patrolman's Association Police Union. You I said, you know, you guys are workers. It's a difficult job. And I kept my word. We made life a little bit easier for police officers in terms of working conditions. You were sharing earlier that when you won the race, you then came into a city council. Still shut up. They said it was a fluke. That was the word that they used. He somehow got in. We're going to make sure he doesn't accomplish anything. So, I was had to work with people who had spent their whole life trying to defeat me. Mhm. It's a weird situation. Very weird. One year later, I worked so hard knocking on doors. We ran a slate of candidates. On election day, we ended up winning three seats plus two gave me veto power. And I think even our opponent said that we better back off. What Bernie is doing is what people want him to do. There's other And where would you find the funding for this? You'd be surprised that small amounts of money can really go a long way. I said to the Department of Parks, I want to plant trees all over the city. Can't be done. You know who planted hundreds of trees in the city of Burlington? The people. on a given Saturday all over the city of Burlington, people were out there planting their own trees. It was a beautiful site. Uh we we initiated concert series. Thousands of people would come out. We just did a whole lot of things to bring people together, not to mention working on some of the really important issues facing the city. Bread and roses. Exactly. Bread and roses. It can't just be struggle. No, it cannot. People have a right to enjoy community. So you established a youth office. Yep. which was headed up by a young woman named Jane Omira Driscoll who 40 years later is still my wife and we got married in the process. So we not only got a youth office I got a wife in the lowincome areas there wasn't even a little league that little league in a low-income area 40 years later is still going. We established a teen center. We attracted kids who weren't doing well in school. You know what happened? Battles of the bands. You know these kids who were coming out. Terrible music. Loudest music you ever heard in your life. But the kids enjoyed it. Honest to God, I bump into people today. Say, I remember that teen center. This created a sense of joy in the community that hadn't existed before. But I think it it speaks to the fact that governance will require everything. Yes. The importance of your election and your governance is that from a moral perspective, you're going to be in sharp contrast to the president of the United States. So, it's important that we cherish our kids, the elderly who help raise us. You know, if we can say it, we believe in compassion and love. That is what motivates us. Oh my god. Know it's a radical thing. According to the president of the United States, you're a communist because you want to improve child care in the city of New York. So bottom line is which is going to fall on your shoulders an enormous responsibility to show the world that our value system can govern well and efficiently. And it's not just on you, it's on the people of New York. What the system has done is taken away our dreams. You're not the radical. A system which gives so much to so few and denies so many people the basic necessities of life. That's radical. Now, I think when you get inaugurated, you're probably not going to have the three richest people in the world sitting right behind you, right? I think not. We wouldn't have invited them. I hope they're not there. You better elect this guy now. I'm ready to go.
