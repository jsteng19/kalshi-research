We're standing here at the exact intersection where in 2021 Matt Jensen was killed. >> He would just like help me with my math homework and he just really brightened everyone's day. >> He was walking in the crosswalk slammed down by a Rolls-Royce going 55 mph in a 25 mph speed limit. >> I've never seen anything like it in my life. It was a ground swell. It was all of that. It was the parents of PS110 and our elected officials, so many neighbors that stood in the breach and said, "This cannot be any longer." >> After his family member showed the keys that Matthew was holding and how they had been damaged and bent because of the velocity of that Rolls-Royce, this community together with the leadership of Assemblywoman Gallagher came together and won $39 million to transform this boulevard. >> And I started working on this in 2008. and it is time that we finish the job. But the recent indictment of Ingred Lewis Martin proves to us what we have already known. >> It alleges a bribery scheme to try to stop a redesign for protected lanes. Lewis Martin got cash and even a speaking role on the Hulu show Godfather of Harlem. >> This community was promised the full road diet from one end of McInness to the other and now we know or Manhattan DA alleges it was a wealthy donor to the Adams administration that ultimately had Ingred's ear and killed it. How do you explain that to your children? Some individual or some business are more important than people not dying. >> And a cameo on a TV show. It brings this question to mind of what is safety worth? Because corruption isn't just about what politicians stand to gain. It's also about what the public loses. >> The Greenpoint community overwhelmingly is demanding safety on our streets. >> This was supposed to be the plan, which as you can see here, one travel lane, one parking lane, one protected bike lane. Collier is the dividing line between the corrupted Adams administration plan and the community plan. >> We want the whole McInness Boulevard to be safe. >> There's no reason why someone should be safe for half. This doesn't just have meaning here in Greenpoint. It sets a model for the rest of this city. For too long, that has been a model that has said that if you have enough money, you could buy your way. But what this model represents, no matter if they drive, if they bike, if they walk, if they ride the bus, if they take the train, we will make decisions with safety as the imperial.
