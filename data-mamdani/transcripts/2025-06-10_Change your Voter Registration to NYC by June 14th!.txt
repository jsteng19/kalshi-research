My team says I move my hands too much in these videos. So, for this one, they're staying in my pockets. The other day on the subway, I met a New Yorker. But get this, they vote in California. I know this is true for many of you. You're Democrats who've chosen not to vote here because you believe your vote counts more elsewhere. Every four years, you vote absentee from your parents address in Philly or three apartments and go in Atlanta. But come on, you live here. I get it. I do. Keep them in your pockets. Especially after this last election. We all wanted to defeat Donald Trump and New York felt like a lock. But in many ways, this election, Trump's back on the ballot. We have a choice between Andrew Cuomo, funded by the same billionaires who put Donald Trump back in the White House, and our campaign, who will tax billionaires to make the city affordable. It's a referendum on where our party goes. So, in just this one instance, ask yourself, WWDFGD, what would a disgraced former governor do? Well, Cuomo changes registration immediately after not having lived here for more than 30 years. So, if he's voting from his new address, so should you. With just single digits between us and Andrew Cuomo, your vote can make the difference. You have until June 14th, this Saturday, to change your registration in New York City. So head to zaharanfornyc.com/vote. Let's win this thing. I do keep them in your pockets. [Laughter]
