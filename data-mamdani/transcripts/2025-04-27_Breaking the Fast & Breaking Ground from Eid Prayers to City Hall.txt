Mubarak, I stand before you as we celebrate the end of Ramadan. We celebrate the end of our fast. And yet we know that for many that hunger will continue. Whether it be the 500,000 children in our city who go to sleep hungry every night or whether it be the children in Philine or in Sudan or in Yemen. We know that hunger continues to be a reality for them. And yet we know that that hunger is a choice that others are making. And I am running for mayor of New York City to make it easier for families to raise their children here where everyone has enough in their family, in their belly, in their life. And I stand before you as one of a million Muslims who call New York City their home. We have 200,000 of us registered as Democrats. But in the last election, do you know how many of us voted? 7%. Now, I will not blame anyone in our community. for not voting because often it feels like there is not much to vote for and we know that our community wants the same thing that every other community wants and deserves. Equality and respect. But in this country, we cannot be given those things. We have to win those things. And the clearest ways that we win them is at the ballot box. And we stand here because we know that there are those, be they the disgraced current mayor or the disgraced former governor, who would like New Yorkers to think that they only have a choice between the past and the present. And we tell them they in fact have the choice of the future, a future that they can afford. So brothers and sisters, I need your help to let everyone in your life know that that opportunity is less than 3 months away. My name is Zaharan Mandani and I'm honored to continue to fight for a city that working people can actually afford. Thank you so much. [Music]
