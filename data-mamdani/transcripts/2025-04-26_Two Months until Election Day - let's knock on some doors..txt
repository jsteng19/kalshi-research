I'm about to share three numbers that both scare and excite me. First, we're at 2 months away from election day. That's it. Second, 50% of New Yorkers still have no idea who I am or what this movement is about. Right now, we're in second place and quickly closing in on Andrew Cuomo. You know, this guy. We've surprised the political establishment. People told us we would never break 5% in the polls, and the last one had us more than 20. A lot of that's thanks to you. Because the more people hear about our plans for a New York City that's affordable, the more they're on board. Who knew that policies like universal child care, rent freeze, and taxes on mega corporations were popular. We did. We also know that to get to 51%, we have to share our vision with many more New Yorkers. Now, here's the final number I wanted to share with you. 1 million. Our campaign needs to knock on more than a million doors. We need your help to do it. Bring your friends. Bring your family. Bring that one neighbor of yours you can't stand, but you also know could not afford another record. The finish line's in sight, like right over there. So head to sirnyc.com/events to help us cross it.
