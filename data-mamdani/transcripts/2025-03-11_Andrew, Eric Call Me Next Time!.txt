12 across. What's a fiveletter word for taking something? Two years ago, I won New York City's first fair free bus pilot. One line in each burrow, and it was a massive success. As mayor, I'll make every bus fast and free. So, imagine my surprise when Andrew Cuomo, the same guy who stole hundreds of millions of dollars from the MTA as governor, suddenly announces his brand new idea. Today, Cuomo unveiled his transportation policy. evaluate the expansion of fair free bus pilot. Andrew Habibi, when was the last time you even took the bus? And he's not the only disgraced New York executive copying our notes. Eric Adams is in on it, too. In January, we announced our plan for NYC Baby Baskets, where every new parent gets a collection of postnatal products, resources, and information free of charge. Nice idea, right? Eric Adams sure thought so. Earlier this month, he announced his own plan to give new mothers at four hospitals across our city baby baskets. That's great, Eric, but why so peace meal? And why so late? Look, I'm happy to see my fellow candidates embrace policies that I'm fighting for, but only if they really mean it. And Eric Adams and Andrew Cuomo, they talk one way and they act another. That's why New Yorkers have turned out in record numbers to ask their neighbors to join our campaign. Look guys, next time just call me. I can tell you all about our plans for a $30 minimum wage or freezing the rent for more than two million rentstabilized tenants or building 200,000 new union built permanently affordable rentstabilized homes or developing a network of municipally owned grocery stores that guarantee cheaper groceries to New Yorkers in each one of the five burrows or how we're going to deliver universal child care or how we're actually going to stand up to bad landlords.
