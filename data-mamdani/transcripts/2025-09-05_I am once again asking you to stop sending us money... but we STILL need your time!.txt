[Music] What? [Music] Well, folks, you've done it again. We can't take any more of your money. Truly, you need to stop. Thanks to you, we've raised the maximum amount of money we can spend in this race, $8 million. And you've done it with more than two months to go until the election. So that means we got it in the bag, right? Wrong. You think Bill Aman's going to sit back and let us walk into city hall? No. He's going to write a very long tweet and then cut an even bigger check to one of our opponents. So get ready to see a lot more scary videos of this face on your TV. But just like we did in June, this movement can overcome their money in November. So we are once again asking not for your dollars, but your time. Sign up to Canvas or Phone Bank at aranfornyc.com/events. Make it a weekly shift. And above all, do not send us any more money.
