Let's see where is next. I'm going to [Music] dial some of those around literature. Mama, I got so much I think what you encounter in terms of canvasing is not even people being hostile to a candidate. It's that people are really really reticent to put trust in politicians and I think that canvasing is an opportunity to try to build that trust. I know all these people or at least I know their pieces. All of them silly. This guy is all heart and hope. And those are two very difficult things to feel at the same time these days. New York. Since the cold of October, we have built something truly. People who I know from completely non-political backgrounds are getting inspired by this campaign. A lot of people are feeling depressed and scared by like things I see in the news. When it comes to like slowing down what is happening on a federal level, everything feels so insurmountable. It's at those moments exactly when you feel powerless and unable to make the effort that you should. Sora Namani's campaign for mayor. I'm Adriana. I'm a volunteer. Door knockocking wins elections. Canvasing wins elections. Connections. That is what wins elections. I'm a very strong supporter. So, we're just asking people if we can guarantee they'll rank him number one. Yeah, I'll rank him number one. Thank you so much. I also see you have a kitty there. I uh canvased a house that had two uh roommates that asked to be put down to volunteer. Wasn't in the best mood that day, but once I came across them, I was like that really uplifted me. People think of Staten Island as like a deeply red burrow, but ultimately it is still a very working-class burrow. So, the reception I've gotten was actually overwhelmingly positive. The things that you care about, the people to the right and left of you both care about. The Bronx loves it so far. and neighbors were saying, you know, thank you for coming to talk to me. You know, why don't we know about him yet? Or, you know, this guy sounds great. We met somebody who had never heard of him, but they instantly loved him. Sir, would you like a flyer for Zoran Mand? You're voting, too? You're going to rank him number one. When I talk to people, they go like, I don't know who's going to be running for me other than Coleman. Everyone's busy working, so I can't blame them. But what one thing you can do is literally advocate for the people that you want. And I want Zoro Mandani. The fact that he wants to implement rent freezes. We got someone to say yes that they're going to vote for Zoron. Especially when I talked to a lot of seniors. They were suddenly very very interested in issues about groceries, cost of living. I actually met a few grandmas who I like loved this pamplate part like in Spanish. There's so many of us that do want a mayor that will actually reflect our values. They were like, "We're number one. We just moved in this neighborhood. We loved him. And then I got to knock on 19 different doors. It It's felt healthy for me to be doing this. It was either to go out there and actually do something about something or to stay at home and do the squirrel. I'm just really lucky to be a part of something bigger than just myself. New York sometimes feels like too big to kind of make a difference in, but it can be a small town. Probably heard that way. Anyways, say hi to swirl here. Also, every single canvas that I have joined, I have met a new person. Like yesterday, I attended a Shabbat dinner that was thrown by another canvaser. I'm here because action is the antidote to despair. There's a lot of feeling that we no longer have autonomy because we're not a billionaire who can buy a license. It's the most optimistic thing that I have seen since the catastrophe back in Jeffy. And people really believe in this man. And I kind of do too. I mean, I don't kind of I do. I think he wants like a city that's more affordable for people to live in. You want to be the meat grinder. Like that's basically what it is. That's how it feels. Living in the city, living anywhere in this world should not be difficult. You It isn't that difficult. Like all we need is someone with the will and the and the strength and character to fight for us. And I think we found that in Mam Dani.
