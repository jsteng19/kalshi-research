Taxi. Yo, man. Take me to your favorite place and keep the meter running. Great. I'm taking you to the Bronx for my ifa. I'm in. Let's go. If you don't mind, on my way, I'll be picking up my friend. Sure, we can pick up your friend. Great. Uh, what's your name? Muhammadu. Where are you from? How long have you been in New York then? 31 years going down. That's a long time to be in New York City. Guess how old I am? I don't know. How old do I look? Uh, I give you 44. 44? Yes, brother. around 38. That's my friend right there. Oh, your friend's here. Yes, sir. Wait, what? Your friend is Zoron? Yes. That's the friend. What? You know that's your friend. That's your brother. Well, get in. We're going to Dar. All right, let's go. All right. Wait, how do you guys know each other? So, we met in 2021. I worked with the New York Taxi Workers Alliance in the fight against the debt crisis. This is a crisis that started in the early 2000s when Mayor Bloomberg inflated the value of a medallion from $200,000 to a million dollars to bridge a budget deficit. It started with 45 days of consecutive protest and civil disobedience. We got arrested outside of city hall. Wait, you got arrested? I got arrested. And you worked for the government? And I worked for the government. Did you get arrested? No. Mama didn't get arrested. Yeah. Don't let Mamadoo get arrested. Yeah, they never let him get arrested. After that, uh, Madu and I went on a hunger strike. You guys both went on a hunger strike? 15 days. No food for 15 days. And then you have to remember this. Nine people, nine of my fo brothers committed suicide. I know I'm a cup driver. And then I'm a proud one, too. You know, this was a dream come true. Driving a cab. And then I see it all the sudden it flip the other way around. It was a nightmare. How much was your debt? 750,000. Oh my god. Whenever we go to city hall, they were not listening. When the assemblymen join, that's when the real fight started. Is this the assembly man? Thank you, my brother. That's incredible. That's when you were like, that's when the fight really start. So often in these fights, you start with the demands at the beginning and then you win a version of them at the end. We won almost exactly what it is that we demanded from the beginning. That's awesome. And it has thus far erased $450 million in debt. Wow. We were given avocado. It never tastes so sweet. After the strike was over. After the strike was November 3rd, 2021. That avocado, I will never forget. Really? Yeah. And when we ate that avocado, I remember Madu getting up and shouting, "I have my life back." I have my life back. I remember you saying that. It stayed with me since then because that's what this was about. People's lives were being taken from them by debt collectors and by a city. So you mama, do you feel like he's the real deal? Definitely. I can put my life online for him. You would put your life on the line? Yes, because he did put his life online for me. Do you want a date? I I got date. Is it time to break the fast? Oh, he's got days. He's been holding out on us. You're all over the place driving people around from 6:00 a.m. and you're at meetings and and protests and y campaign rallies. I can't imagine how difficult it would be to be you guys fasting. I mean, it's but this is the job. And Madu, how about you? Why do you love Ramadan? For me, that's the best month of the year. I can't wait to have Ramadan all year around. You want Ramadan all year round? Yeah. Yes. Oh my goodness. One month is enough. Ramadan. What? 12 months of Ramadan. It's beautiful. 1 month is enough.
