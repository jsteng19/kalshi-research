I just voted for me. And here's the thing, you can vote for you, too. Because this race isn't about me. It isn't about Andrew Cuomo. It's about your future and your city. But if you're a young New Yorker, it's easy to feel like your voice doesn't matter. Politicians don't take you or your concern seriously because they don't think you'll vote. But listen up. If you're under 30, you weren't even alive the last time Andrew Cuomo lived in New York City. So, if he thinks he's qualified to be your mayor, you're more than qualified to vote for mayor. Young people are already smashing expectations with surging turnout. But if we want to defeat Andrew Cuomo and his MAGA billionaire donors, we need an earthquake because my platform of a rent freeze, fast and free buses, universal childcare funded by taxes on the rich could be the difference between you having to move to Jersey City and getting to stay in the five burrows. Early voting runs through Sunday, election day on Tuesday, and you can go to zeronfornyc.com/pollsite to find out where you can cast your ballot. So, as they say, no standing, yes voting.
