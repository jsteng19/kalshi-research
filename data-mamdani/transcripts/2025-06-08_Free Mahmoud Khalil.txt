A bright young man comes to the US to study. He meets the love of his life. She's from the Midwest. They settle down, get married, and are about to start a family. That's a story that could describe so many New Yorkers across this city. 3 months ago today, right here in this lobby. This was Mahmud Khalil, his wife Nure, and their soon to be born child. That's not okay. He's not resisting. He's giving me his phone. Okay. He's not I have He's not resisting. There's no need for this. Don't worry. Be happy. You're going to have to come with us. Don't worry. I'm coming with you. No. Mahmud was born to Palestinian parents in a refugee camp in Syria. Nure was born in Michigan. On March 8th, Mahmud was forcibly abducted by ICE agents who had followed him home. His wife asked the most basic questions. Can we get your name? We don't give our name. What was he charged with? Where were they taking him? But she received no answers. Call him. ICE claims Mahmud tried to flee, but footage shows he clearly did not. Days later, it was finally revealed that Mahmood had been taken to a jail in rural Louisiana, where he's been held for 3 months in perilous conditions. He was only recently granted a brief visitation with his wife, Nure, and their newborn son, Dean, whose birth he could not witness. Mahmud is a permanent resident, the same legal status that more than 600,000 New Yorkers have today and that I once had myself. But he has been denied basic constitutional rights and detained simply for political speech. Mahmud Khalil, like thousands of other New Yorkers, was standing up for Palestinian human rights. And for that, he was threatened. But when he shared concerns about his safety with Columbia University, they did nothing to stand in ISIS way. Mahmud is a New Yorker just like you and me. There's been no accountability for his abduction, his total denial of rights, and for Columbia University and this city's failure to protect him. New York is a sanctuary city, but Eric Adams has allowed ICE to operate in our neighborhoods and on our campuses with impunity. This is a moment to speak in one voice for the First Amendment and to free Mahmood.
