I want to tell you about who we're running against a guy who cut Medicaid and stole money from the MTA who says he's fighting for the working class but showered his Rich donors with tax breaks and when he was accused of Serial sexual misconduct spent years hounding the women who spoke out no I'm not talking about Donald Trump I'm talking about Andrew Cuomo I was grateful that he supported the campaign Cuomo says he will not be returning any of Donald Trump's money now he's decided to move from Westchester to New York City with the promise of leading us through the chaos of Donald Trump but Andrew Cuomo is the chaos Governor sexually harassed multiple women intentionally delayed releasing covid death numbers at nursing homes profited on a book While others were dying from our Subways claustrophobia Panic heat exhaustion is Governor Cuomo raing New York City taxpayer dollars at the expense of the MTA to our schools Cuomo has cut taxes on millionaires Estates and Banks while reducing spending on public schools to the hospitals that could have saved more lives during the pandemic I would call Governor Cuomo probably the single most important person in terms of the drive to close down hospital beds time and time again Andrew Cuomo has put billionaires and book deals before you and he's waited this long to announce his run for mayor to avoid answering why I thought your question was stupid let's try not to be obnoxious I think New Yorkers are hungry for a different kind of politics one that puts working people first and that's exactly what our campaign is doing so every door you knock every dollar you donate you help us take one step closer to building a city and Working Class People can actually afford
