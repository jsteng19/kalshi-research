Today I will be introducing the next mayor of the city of New York, Zoron Mandan. Let's go, [Applause] Brooklyn. Let's go. [Music] Good evening, Brooklyn. Are you ready for a city we can afford? Are you ready to win this race? I said, are you ready to win this race? I want to thank each and every one of you for being here tonight. We are living in a moment of immense fear and despair. Our minds chained to anxiety, our days with too little time, and our bodies with even less energy to pursue the things that bring us joy. But nights like this are the antidote. Movement is the medicine. And we're here tonight because we love this city. But there is a myth about this city. one that has persisted for far too long. It's the lie that life has to be hard in New York. The lie that only the rich or the lucky get to live a good life here. I believe every New Yorker deserves a life of dignity, safety, and stability, and that it's city government's job to deliver that. I believe we can freeze the rent for more than 2 million tenants and build hundreds of thousands of affordable homes. I believe we can make the slowest buses in the nation fast and free. And I believe that we can deliver universal child care to make it easier to raise a family in this city. I said I believe we can freeze the make buses fast and deliver universal. I said I believe we can freeze the make buses fast and deliver universal. I believe we can guarantee cheaper groceries. We can raise the minimum wage to $30 an hour. I believe we can crack down on bad landlords. And I believe we can do this while standing up to Donald Trump, a wannabe king who is ripping New Yorkers from our neighborhoods, our schools, our apartment lobbies from the very fabric of our city. And as your next mayor, I won't just believe. I will deliver. [Applause] Now, we face a choice in this election. A choice between a disgraced politician of the past with a government beholden to billionaires and real estate or our vision for the future. We are done with empty promises wrapped up in flimsy packaging of dishonesty and corruption. [Applause] We want to dream again. The same dream that brought so many of us to this city in the first place. New York. Since the cold of October, we have built something truly great together. We have built a movement that transcends race and class. A movement that reaches from the sandy beaches of Coney Island to the cricut pitches of Vancland Park. And we've built it together, side by side, door by door. Those cold months are now over, my friends. And what we have dreamt in the night, we will build in the dawn. [Applause] The sun is starting to rise. And together, New York on June 24th, we are going to win. [Applause] Thank you, New York City. [Applause]
