we gathered tonight in the wealthiest city in the wealthiest country in the history of the world and it is unlivable for the working class who built it this is a quiet grinding crisis that doesn't just play out in dollars and cents but in Lost sleep anxiety and shame in homelessness and even in death for others it is the fading dream of raising a family in the neighbor neighborhood they love the cost of living isn't just the result of unaccountable Market forces our elected officials aren't just bystanders these are choices and at almost every opportunity Eric Adams has chosen to make this city more expensive for the people who keep it running but I believe New Yorkers are hungry for a vision that puts their needs and aspirations at the very heart of government and that is why I stand before you as a candidate for New York city [Applause] mayor we all want more money in our pocket more dignity in our lives more rest and joy in this wild beautiful city we can afford to make life easier here and we can afford to dream let us make those dreams a reality and let let us do it together thank you
