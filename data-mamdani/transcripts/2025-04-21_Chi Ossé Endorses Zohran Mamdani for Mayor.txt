It's time for our city to turn a new page cuz this mayor sold us out. I'm Chio. I'm Zuran Madamani. And I represent New York City Council District 36. Is this your trail? Yeah, let's go. This city is the world's greatest experiment in human cooperation. And there are those who want to tear it down and sell it out. Trump from the outside, affordability crisis from the inside. How many more people could thrive with more affordable housing, world class transit, and universal childcare? Absolutely, man. They don't want people to believe they can ask for more, so we have to demand more. You know, Andrew Cuomo cut Medicaid. Yeah. And he stole money from the MTA to subsidize upstate ski resorts. Jesus Christ. I love this city. I just want it to be better. With all New York has going for it, I just can't help but ask, why not working? It's time to make New York work for everyone. You knew it. Yes. You're running for office. Yeah, I'm running for mayor. I'm running with you, brother. In this political moment, we need someone with the energy to stand up to Donald Trump with an inspirational vision of the most our city can be. And that's why I'm endorsing Zoran Mani for mayor. You can't hand New York City over to a dangerous grifter like Andrew Cuomo. Election day is on June 24th and early voting starts on June 14th. So, what'd you get? Spicy chicken sandwich. They didn't have nachos.
