Good evening. Thank you so much for having me. We are live here in the most expensive city in the United States of America. 1 in 4 New Yorkers are living in poverty. And I am running to be your next mayor. To make this city affordable. I will do so by freezing the rent for more than 2 million rent stabilized tenants, by making the slowest busses in the country fast and free, and by delivering universal child care. And I will pay for this by taxing the 1%, the billionaires and profitable corporations that Mr. Cuomo cares more about than working class New Yorkers. I will ask them to pay their fair share so we can have a city that everyone can afford.

So I have experience in this, actually, because in my first year in the state legislature, I came to Albany, where we had a governor then who didn't want to raise taxes on billionaires and corporations. That was then Governor Cuomo. And we actually overcame his objections, raised $4 billion in new annual revenue, and finally funded the very public schools that he had starved for so many years.

No, I don't think that it's unfair, but I have no interest in in believing that they're actually pursuing justice.

To be clear, it's not unfair because Andrew Cuomo did lie to Congress. But ultimately, we know that the Trump Justice Department and the Trump administration as a whole is interested more in vindictiveness and persecution of political enemies than in anything to do with justice.

President Trump will target whomever is the next mayor of this city. President Trump even targeted his, in many ways, accomplice. Mayor Eric Adams, who has collaborated with the Trump administration at almost every opportunity. And still in the midst of that collaboration, we saw that New Yorkers are being taken off the streets and they're apartment building lobbies. We have $80 million being taken out of our city bank account. So I don't think there's any question that there's any mayor here that will be free from being attacked by Donald Trump. What's more important, however, is that we have a mayor who will actually fight back, and that's what I will do. I am Donald Trump's worst nightmare as a progressive Muslim immigrant who actually fights for the things that I believe in. And the difference between myself and Andrew Cuomo is that my campaign is not funded by the very billionaires who put Donald Trump in DC. I don't have to pick up the phone from Bill Ackman or Ken Langone. I have to pick up the phone for the more than 20,000 New Yorkers who contributed an average donation of about $80 to break fundraising records and put our campaign in second place.

Look, it's true that I don't have experience with corrupt Trump billionaires who are funding my campaign. I don't have experience with party politics and insider consultants, or I do have experience, however, with winning $450 million in debt relief for thousands of working class taxi drivers and actually delivering for the working class people.

Brief response. I want to be very clear that police have a critical role to play in creating public safety. And when I speak to those very officers on the beat in the rank and file, I hear from them a frustration that where they joined the force to tackle serious crimes, we are instead now asking them to play the roles of mental health professionals and social workers. And that is why we are putting forward a plan to create a Department of Community Safety that will tackle gun violence, homelessness, the mental health crisis.

in my Department of Community safety, we are going to put together dedicated teams of mental health outreach workers who will be deployed to the top hundred subway stations with the highest levels of mental health crises and homelessness. We are actually going to address this in a manner that goes beyond the same ideas that we hear time and time again, recycled by the same politicians like Andrew Cuomo, who brought us to this point. And if we care about the police force, then we have to actually listen to police officers. They are leaving this force, 200 of them each month. And when you ask them why, it's because of the forced overtime. And part of the reason that that is taking place is we're asking them to respond to every failure of the social safety.

I want to sustain the headcount that we have in the police department, and I want to listen to police officers who are leaving in droves from the department because they're asking they're being asked to do the work of mental health professionals and social workers. Right now, police officers pick up hundreds of phone calls a day that are mental health crises, hundreds of thousands a year. That's not the work that they signed up to do. And when it comes to shoplifting and retail theft, when, you know, the key here is to listen to workers themselves, they have spoken time and time again about the need for increased staffing in our Walgreens and our Duane reads. And when it comes to organized crime,

We have to ensure the police actually hold them accountable.

You know, I find it ridiculous to hear Andrew Cuomo talk about how we need to regulate the apps when this is the very mayoral candidate who has a super PAC that received $1 million from DoorDash, how are you going to regulate DoorDash when they are giving you $1 million to influence your street safety regulations and your labor regulations? This model, this economic model, is one that doesn't just incentivize e-bike riders to break street safety laws. It often requires

You know, as a Democrat, one of my regrets is having trusted the leaders within our own party leaders like Andrew Cuomo. Because what we've seen is that kind of leadership has delivered us to this point where we are under attack by an affordability crisis on the inside and a Trump administration on the outside. And Democrats are tired of being told by leaders from the past that we should continue to simply wait our turn. We should continue to simply trust when we know that's the very leadership that got us to this point. We need to turn the page for new leadership to take us out.

Our city is under attack by an authoritarian Trump administration, and it is under attack. That is now being echoed by Trump's allies right here in New York City. And I say that as someone who would be the first immigrant mayor of the city in generations, someone who just yesterday had a sitting, elected official call for me to be deported. This is not an intellectual exercise for the people of New York City. We deserve to have a mayor who is not funded by the same billionaires that put Donald Trump in DC. We deserve to have a mayor who will actually fight back. And the way that we fight back is ensure that our local institutions continue to provide the services to each and every New Yorker. And if that funding,

Here's the thing the Donald Trump administration will use the fact that they fund 7% of our city budget as leverage over us to try and give up whichever category of New Yorkers they are pursuing in that day. Ultimately, what we need to do is tell those same institutions we will provide them that funding, and we'll get that funding by taxing the 1% and the wealthiest corporations right here in New York State.

yes absolutely I'll do so. I'll do so shortly after we have Mr. Cuomo who said these words of shuck and jive when Barack Obama was running to be the president of our country. I was proud in 2008 that the first doors I ever knocked on was for Barack Obama, while we had a candidate here. Why did you call him an evil? Well, we have a candidate here who was. So who is a candidate here who is so allergic to any accountability or acknowledgment of a mistake that he can't even admit that he said these kinds of words. Now, as it pertains to public education, all of the challenges that we are facing in our city when it comes to our schools, they are also downstream from the fact that 500,000 of our children are going to sleep hungry every single night, 100,000 of them for the ninth consecutive year are now homeless. We need to ensure we have a city where our children can not only have food to eat, a place to call their home and we also have

full implementation of class size reduction.

I believe neither of you denied the quote,

You did not.

Mayor Wu of Boston,

I'm more of an ABC guy. Anybody but Cuomo. I'll be telling my voters, however, who to rank number two before election Day.

Maya Wiley,

if you are one of the close to 2.5 million New Yorkers who live in rent stabilized housing, I will freeze your rent. And I will do that because you have a median household income of $60,000, while your landlord profits have increased by 12%. This is an act that will bring nearly $7 billion back into your pocket and back into the pockets of our local economy. This is what we will do immediately, and we will do so because the mayor has the power to. Even though there are those like Andrew Cuomo on this stage who will tell you it's unrealistic. We know the previous mayor actually did this three times, and on top of this, we're going to build 200,000 affordable homes, homes that are for the New Yorker, who has a median household income of $70,000 for a family of four. We'll do this while taking on the very bad landlords and the real estate developers who are funding Andrew Cuomo's campaign. $2.5 million last time I checked. And we're going to do that because ultimately, every single person needs to follow the law, and that includes the landlords who are violating our housing code and have $800 million in fines that the city has yet to actually collect on.

he's he's invoking I should be able to respond, just, you know, just for 10s here. Brief response. What the governor is speaking about is when we want to fight for working class people, it's considered unrealistic. But when he wants to give Elon Musk a $1 billion tax break, it's totally feasible. What the Daily News found is that this would mean taking a $30 billion budget, increasing it such that we could actually create truly affordable housing.

I think this is yet another example of a gross overreach of the Trump administration, one that they have shown they will continue to pursue with whichever university they decide to target. It's been Columbia. It's been Harvard. We need to have a mayor that will actually stand up to Donald Trump, not one that we have right now that will collaborate with them. And that is who I will be as someone who is, in the words of Shirley Chisholm, Unbought and Unbossed, because the donors who are putting me in second place in this race are working class New Yorkers across this city.

He should be set free. He should be at home with his wife, Nora, and their young child. And the fact that he is still in Louisiana is an abomination. It's an attack on our First Amendment. And it is clear, another example of Donald Trump weaponizing the very real issue of anti-Semitism to then throw Palestinian New Yorkers into detention facilities and not even tell us what the crime is that they're charged with.

Well, I think Andrew Cuomo would tell you that he's already replaced a campaign worker who would have written his housing policy with AI because he had it written by ChatGPT. I can tell you that I'm proud to be endorsed by the labor union representing the largest number city workers, Dc37. And I'm proud of that, because my approach to artificial intelligence will be one where we can find efficiencies in the contracts and consultants that we work with as a city, but we are not going to use this language of artificial intelligence as a justification for further layoffs of city workers. We are actually many

Yes, we should ban all nonessential helicopter travel,

I would stay in New York City. My plans are to address New Yorkers across the five boroughs and focus on that.

I've said in a UJA questionnaire that I believe that you need not travel to Israel to stand up for Jewish New Yorkers, and that is what I will be doing as the mayor. I'll be standing up for Jewish New Yorkers, and I'll be meeting them wherever they are across the five boroughs, whether that's in their synagogues and temples or at their homes or at the subway platform. Because ultimately we need to focus on delivering on their concerns

I believe Israel has the right to exist, not as a Jewish state, as a state with equal rights.

Unlike you, I unlike you, I answer questions very directly and I want to be very clear. I believe every state should be a state of equal rights.

I grew up in Morningside Heights, so I have to say Coronets.
