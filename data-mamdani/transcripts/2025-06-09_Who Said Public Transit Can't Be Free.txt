Take it in. A true icon of New York, the Staten Island Ferry. The Staten Island Ferry is a beacon on the waters of New York City, shuttling about 45,000 people a day. And the best part, it's free. For decades after opening in 1898, the Staten Island Ferry was just a nickel. Then in the 1970s, the fair rose to a quarter. And in 1990, 50 cents. But since 1997, the fair's been free. And New Yorkers have come to know it as a dependable means of transit. And it's the best way to see the Statue of Liberty. So when people say buses can never be free, don't ask them to take a hike. Ask them to take the ferry. On June 24th, let's get some more free transit. [Music]
