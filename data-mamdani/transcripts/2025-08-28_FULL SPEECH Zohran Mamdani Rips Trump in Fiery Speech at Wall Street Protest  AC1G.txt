How are we doing today?
Is the dream still alive?
Is the dream still alive? Is the dream
still alive?
We know that dream lives on in every
single person who is here today.
It is a dream
that we have heard time and again that
it has to be deferred. And yet we know
that its time has come. As we stand here
in the wealthiest city in the wealthiest
country in the history of the world. As
we stand here by Wall Street where last
year they had more than $40 billion in
bonuses.
We ask ourselves, how is it that one in
four New Yorkers are still living in
poverty?
We ask ourselves, how is it that we have
still yet to answer the question that
Dr. King posed all those decades ago?
Because what he said then and what we
must answer now is, what good is it to
have the right to sit at a lunch counter
if you can't afford to buy a hamburger?
Our
freedom is only as good as our ability
to exercise it. And I want to thank
Reverend Sharpton. I want to thank the
King family for continuing to show that
this dream lives on.
And it will live on until we achieve
that dream where every single person in
this city and in this country has the
dignity that they deserve in their
lives. So my name is Zahanwaame Mdani.
I stand before you as a man looking to
be the next mayor of this city.
And I tell you that every day I will
wake up with Dr. King's dream at the
forefront of my mind. A dream where we
make this city, the most expensive in
the United States of America, affordable
for each and every person across this
city.
So thank you so much for being here.
Thank you for marching. Thank you to the
ref. Thank you to the family. And to
Donald Trump, we say this to you.
We will continue to fight for that which
our forefathers have fought for because
what we fight for is no less than what
we deserve. And we will not let you take
that dignity from us. We will not let
you take that decency from us. We will
not let you take it from us because we
will be here fighting each and every day
for that which we deserve. Thank you so
much.
