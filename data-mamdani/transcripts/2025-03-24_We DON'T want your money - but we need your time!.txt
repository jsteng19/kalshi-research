I'm about to say something to you you've never heard a politician say. Please stop sending us money. Thanks to the close to 18,000 of you that have donated to our campaign, we've now raised the maximum amount of money we can spend in this race. $8 million. This means we have the money to be on TV, in your mailbox, on your phone. But there's one more place we need to be. Your block. That's why I'm putting out the call to New Yorkers. Assemble. We want to create the single largest volunteer operation in New York City history. And we need your help. So join the more than 7,000 New Yorkers already knocking on doors and sign up to Canvas at zaharanfornyc.com/events.
