Good morning. Houseke keeping my canvas doors. That's how I do. I do this sometimes, too. No way. And what is it meant for you to be in a union? To have a union job? Oh my god. Having a union job is food on the table, a roof over your head. I used to live in New Jersey before and I was in a domestic violence relationship and then we end up in a shelter. How many landlords did you go to that turned you down? Over a hundred. Over a hundred. Over a hundred. And from there, I just kept looking for jobs. And my first job I got was housekeeping. I'm going to show you my favorite thing to do. Please. Like when I do the sheet, I have to have it like flow. See what I'm saying? Look at that. Look at that. It gives me chills. You're an artist. I like to hear the sound. Yeah. Yeah. That's why I love my job so much. What difference have you felt from when you did this work at a non-union hotel? I've done rooms in a non-union hotel where I didn't have a vacuum. I literally have to sweep the carpet, right? And it was like especially like it was a Christmas time and they had like all the glitter all over and the manager, she gave me a broom. Imagine sweeping up glitter off the carpet. I was doing lobby attendant. I was doing housemen. And you said when you started that job you were making$ 8.25 an hour? Yeah. I never went up. That was it. So it was still$ 8.25 even when you were working in the lobby. It was still$8.25. 25. Wow. Cuz it was non-union. Yeah. And that's why I keep these pictures here. This is when we was in the shelter together. So this is Joshua right here. And this is Jordan. And I'm so sorry. No, please. And you know, I had this here since 2016. When Rich Morocco gave me, I never removed it. Junior. Yeah. She's going to Al Avenue University. That's amazing. You should be so proud. This is my little castle. Is this a rent stabilized apartment? Yeah. And I'm paying 18 by myself and I can't even afford groceries and plus my monthly rent or not ticket, you know. And then when that rent goes up every year, makes it harder and harder. It went up again. Yeah. Yeah. More than a dozen of these a day. Yeah. And you were saying if you hit the 14 by 1:30, you could leave early. Thanks to the union for early program. Okay. Isn't that amazing? That is. And you have your seven hours. Yeah. Thanks to Rich Morocco and God two people. Yes. And Mandela is about to be mayor of New York. Yes. Thank you.
