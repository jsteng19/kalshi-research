There's a lot of things that make New York City special. For me, it's the deli and bodeas. Habibi, could I get an egg and cheese on a roll with jalapeno? One's doing special coming up. Small businesses employ nearly half of all New Yorkers in the private sector. They keep the city running, but the last four years have been hard. We've seen the dollar slice go extinct, storefront after storefront close, and had a mayor and Eric Adams who has ignored the struggles of small businesses. That's why as mayor, I'm going to make it faster, easier, and cheaper for small businesses to get started and stay open. First, we're going to cut fines and fees for small businesses by 50%. Regulations are important, but small businesses have to navigate more than 6,000 of them with far fewer resources than the big chains. That's why as mayor, I'll appoint a mom and pop Zar with a clear goal of making it easier to run a small business. $1,000 isn't a lot to our city government, but it can be make or break for a small business trying to get off the ground. Next, we're going to accelerate permit application. The mom and pop star will coordinate with agencies to speed up turnaround times, cut red tape, and let New Yorkers start businesses sooner because you shouldn't have to fill out 24 forms and go through seven agencies to start a barber shop. But most of all, we're putting our money where our mouth is by increasing funding for small business support programs with 500%. We're going to invest $20 million in our business express service teams, which pairs small businesses with a city case manager that helps them navigate permits and regulations, as well as connecting them with programs that provide them with financial and legal assistance. Right now, only 3% of businesses are using these programs. We want that number to skyrocket. The only thing more in New York than an egg and cheese are the small businesses that make them. Together, we can not only protect them, but encourage new ones to make a home in our city. [Music]
