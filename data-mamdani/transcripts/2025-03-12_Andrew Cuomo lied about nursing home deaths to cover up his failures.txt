do you know today I still don't have an answer of whether my father counted as a nursing home covid death welcome welcome welcome welcome this is my father's family there were a dozen kids and my family's been on this block for five generations now five generations wow so he he goes into the nursing home nothing to do with Co nothing to do with Co he doesn't have and let me be clear the nursing home administrator knew how active we were in his health he came to me and said Daniel we got a problem the governor is forcing us to take covid positive patients this is the order where he said no resident shall be denied admission and readmission solely based on a covid diagnosis this order was in place for 6 weeks even though the death toll was mounting we were thinking that if you had 55 deaths in kobble hill and there's 620 nursing homes we figured out that the death to was more than 15,000 that was 6 or 7 months before the Attorney General's report came out that he was lying about the true numbers and ultimately Our Father suffered along with others but that's what gave us the idea of this memorial wall because people wanted to celebrate their lost loved ones which you couldn't do because most people died alone and then you couldn't celebrate their life because we were on lockdowns we've talked a lot about Governor quomo can we talk a little bit more about your father one time I'll give you some really funny thing my father went and bought lanterns battery ulated lanterns he was a Costco holic and I screamed at him you buy these things for a week later we had a blackout he put the barbecue in the front put the lights up and anybody who came by got food got F so this is who he was you know what I mean unfortunately for us Governor Cuomo made nursing homes the first and only option for covid positive patients and not the absolute last place to send and he still still hasn't apologized no we were three fee from him in Congress he wouldn't look at us he wouldn't apologize to any of us
