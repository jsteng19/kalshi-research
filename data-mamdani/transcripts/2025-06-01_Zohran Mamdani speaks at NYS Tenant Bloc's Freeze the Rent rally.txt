As the state assembly member representing Ntoria in Long Island City, I have had an 82year-old woman come into my office and tell me that her rent is now double that of her social security check and that her landlord has now filed for eviction. And my office took every step we could. We spent three months and finally through H we got her the support she needed. We kept her in her home. But we deserve a mayor who will do that for every single New Yorker. Who will fight to keep every single New Yorker in their home. Because too often in this city, in our politics, the only exodus that politicians are worried about are that of the wealthy when we finally tax them what they should pay. But the real exodus is already happening. It's working and middle class New Yorkers who are being pushed out of this city because it's the most expensive one in the country. And so I'm going to ask you one more time. We're running to freeze the to freeze the to freeze the to freeze the You have my commitment. You have my word. And together on June 24th, we're going to win this race so that next year we freeze the French.
