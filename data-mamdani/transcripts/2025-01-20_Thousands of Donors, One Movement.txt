Yuri Yuri okay what this is a cold KN it is yeah oh this is nuts [Music] yes we're we're just popping in and knocking on doors of people who've donated the campaign we were wondering if we could chat with you we're making a video about people who've supported we want to tell story of who the people are hello welcome I absolutely appreciate you being down here it was so lovely to be here I sent you $25 well thank you so much you donated to a May roll campaign before mayal no I don't think I have this is my first time actually this is my first campaign ever what prompted you to make that donation we have a horrible mayor and you're a great candidate I actually remember pretty distinctly what you did for the New York City Taxi drivers and you you quite literally put your body on the line for workers I want New York City to be nice and I'm not sure that there are other candidates who want to make it nice for me and for the working class this is b beach I grew up sort of between here and D Heights it's a working class area a lot of immigrants my dad and I talk a lot my mom about politics so first and foremost I was saying is how do we actually make life livable for the people people who make the city run and not just folks in Manhattan even though I love wood law and I own a house I still feel the pinching of Housing and so that's why I contributed we were just looking at all of the donations that came in and they covered almost every zip code I just wanted to rep Sten Island because we get a bad rep but I feel like our roots are here I know as a father of two young adult children I'm deeply concerned about their capacity to be able to afford to live in New York when you talked about rentry has always helped me see my future when I saw your vision for what housing could be like it was a no-brainer for me it's been tough finding a place to live in the last few years depending on the kindness of others I don't know I'm a little nervous I don't know no you're doing you're doing great I mean I think this is this is what it is like for a lot of New Yorkers yeah that life is just tough it's something that we seem to accept as if it's part of what it means to be a New Yorker it doesn't actually have to be tough there's a summer where I took the bus and and I would have to wait and wait and wait and wait I know I'm looking at my ConEd bill this month and it's just gone up hundreds of dollars I 150 for water to 200 for electricity electricity I love New York but it could be so much better because I feel that your ideas are good and the ideas that I don't know about I trust the free bus program I mean I I experienced taking the free bus and it was great you the results across New York City were great but especially on Staten Island I mean it's far too difficult to live on Staten Island and only use public transit there is a reason why people aren't able to do that hello I don't want to see a mayor that yells at journalists and yells at city workers P administrations have not done enough for a city so that's why we just need a better mayor that isn't going to go to federal prison I feel like you're the first candidate that made me feel like yo like we can actually do something and somebody who looks like me who talks like me who represents my people that's what is impressive about hitting almost every zip code in the city that you're doing the mayor is an office of representing every part of the city and the city is huge I'm happy to hold the penguin for yeah no hold the're busy we have the whole family
