so zoron is a candidate for mayor who has chased me down for almost a whole entire year and so I'll give him two minutes today to introduce himself to the congregation thank you so much Reverend Moore it is an honor to be here at First Baptist my name is Zan kuame mamdani I'm an assembly member from Queens and I'm running to be your next mayor I believe that to know someone you must know where they come from I was born in Uganda East Africa came to this city when I was 7 years old but I want to tell you a story about another man from Uganda my father in 1962 when Uganda won its independence from the British the United States government granted Uganda 23 scholarships and my father won one of those scholarships and he came to this country as a student at the University of Pittsburgh came to be an electrical engineer about six or seven months into his time as a student he was studying and he heard the words reverberate through the corridor which side are you on which side are you on and it was members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee recruiting students to get on the bus to go to Montgomery Alabama and my father got up got on the bus marched was hosed down and thrown in jail as he had one phone call he called the Ugandan Ambassador he said can you get me out of jail he said whatat are you doing in the jail of a foreign country we sent you there to study he said you sent me here as a gift for our freedom and they are fighting for theirs it's the same struggle and I was raised with that sense that freedom and the fight for it is interconnected and as I look around this city today I'm reminded however that freedom is only as good as our ability to exercise it and I remember the words of Dr King who said what good is having the right to sit at a lunch counter if you can't afford a hamburger what good is the right to live in New York City if you can't afford your rent if you can't afford your Metro card if you can't afford your child care if you can't afford your groceries and so I'm running to be your next mayor so that you can afford this city and I'm running to do that by freezing the rent and by building 200,000 new affordable permanently rent stabilized homes by making the slowest buses in the nation fast and Free by opening a network of city-run grocery stores one in each burrow that guarantee lower prices for bread and milk and eggs and by delivering Universal child care and so I stand before you four months into a campaign four months away from an election day in the hopes of earning your support because I know that to win on June 24th I cannot do so alone we can only do so together so thank you so much much
