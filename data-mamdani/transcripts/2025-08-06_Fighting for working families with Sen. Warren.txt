Nobody disagrees with that, Senator, but raising taxes in order to do it conversation. Good. Oh dear. Are you worried that billionaires are going to go hungry? You know, I watched this race, read all the stories about Cuomo going in and bending the need of the billionaires, right? Adams going in, bending the knee of the billionaires. And nothing about you bending the need of the billionaires. And I thought, billionaires aren't going to like that. My view is we're running out of time here. It is time to get universal child care. It's why I wanted to come here to be with you. You inspire me. When you tell the people of New York City, we can do better. We can make this a more affordable city. And when you make child care a key part of that, I'm in all the way. So, how come you won? You know, we showed that organized people beats organized money. Well, you know, let me ask you a question because you've been at the forefront of this fight for childare for a long time. People have told you for years that this kind of a vision, right, is unrealistic, right? And that's a lot of what we hear when we talk about freezing the rent, making buses free, universal child care. They say it's not going to happen, right? What do you say to those critics? What have you said? You ever heard of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau? Yes, I have. Do you know what everybody told me about that agency? Impossible. Can't be done. Ask for something small. You know, my view on this is ask for what actually fixes the problem and then get out there and fight for it. You know, when Andrew Cuomo gave Elon Musk $950 million in tax credits, there weren't the same questions whether it was realistic. Everybody saying, "Whoa, is that realistic?" But when we're talking about what is truly our most precious resource, you want to build a successful city, you want to build a successful nation, what should you be investing in? You invest in your babies. You invest in your little kids. You invest in the people who are going to do the work in this city. Politics is ultimately about our values. Our budgets are about our values. So if you really think all we're supposed to be doing is helping the billionaires have a little smoother path through life, then fine, vote for Cuomo. But if you actually think what our job is is to give our kids a chance, that's that's what this is all about. I think that running a campaign that talks directly to people about how unaffordable their lives have become and that by golly, you're going to put your shoulder to the wheel to change that. You speak to a lot of people. Maybe you don't have all those millions of dollars and the billionaire's backing, but you have a lot of people who are putting a lot of trust in you, a lot of hope, and I want to see what's happen. You excited to do this together? Good. You know, even with the practice, you're bending the knees. You want to do that? I think that's it. That's it. Come on. There you go. Please. Good. I like that.
