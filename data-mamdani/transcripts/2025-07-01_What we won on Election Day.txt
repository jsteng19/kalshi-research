One week ago, we shocked the establishment and redrew the political map with a campaign relentlessly focused on the needs of working people. Since then, a lot of people have asked me if I was surprised by the results. In some ways, I was. We always thought our victory would come after multiple rounds of rank choice voting. So, when we got more first round votes than Eric Adams got in seven rounds in the last election, it was astonishing. But in other ways, this was always the plan. We wanted to rebuild a coalition that had frayed over years of disappointment and neglect to win people back to a Democratic party that puts working people first. So, let's break it down. Last November, New York City saw some of the biggest shifts towards Donald Trump of anywhere in the country. Much of it took place in working-class and immigrant neighborhoods. A few days after the election, we went to Hillside Avenue in Queens and Form Road in the Bronx, not to lecture, but to listen. And what we heard was a desire to bring down the cost of living. That was our focus. And many of those voters came back. Brighton Beach went for Trump by 44 points. Last week, we won it by 16. College Point was a plus 11 Trump neighborhood. We took it by eight points. We saw similar or even bigger swings in Bath Beach, Atoria Heights, and the Northshore of Staten Island. The headline is clear. We can win back voters many have written off if we give them something to vote for, not just tell them what to be against. When Eric Adams eaked out a win by 7,000 votes four years ago, he called it a mandate and pronounced himself the new face of the Democratic Party. Even then, it was a little ridiculous. But in some neighborhoods, he did put up impressive margins. Take Flatbush for example. Eric Adams dominated there, double digits ahead of his next rival. On Tuesday, there was also a double-digit victory, except it was for us over Andrew Cuomo. We flipped Crown Heights by 45 points, North Corona by 33, and Jamaica by a staggering 57 points. These are the outer burough voters that Eric Adams said he'd bring with him to city hall. He served as donors instead. Whether we're talking about young voters, older voters, or just plain disaffected New Yorkers, no campaign in recent history has been as successful at driving new voter registrations, especially in the 100 days before the election. Just take a look at this graph. According to the Times, in the 14 days before the registration deadline, about 37,000 people registered to vote. That's over 10 times the number of new registrations over the same period of time in the 2021 mayoral primary. As a result, we won big with zero prime voters, New Yorkers who had not voted in any recent mayoral primary. For instance, in Graves End, at least 32% of all voters were firsttime primary voters. Most campaigns focus on triple primes, New Yorkers who voted in the last three primaries. But this strategy ignores most of our city. Yet, we knew that we could turn them out if they saw themselves in our policies. We ran a campaign that tried to talk to every New Yorker, whether I could speak their language or just try. Al Alien. All the words are new. And the coalition that came out on Tuesday reflected the mosaic of these five burrows. We won South Asian neighborhoods by huge margins in places like City Line, Ozone Park, Jamaica Hills. We won Latino neighborhoods like Corona, Washington Heights, Palm Bay, and Wood Haven. We won many of the same Chinese voters that turned out for Trump in Flushing, Chinatown, and Bensonhurst. And in the final months of the campaign, we narrowed Andrew Cuomo's one sizable lead with black voters, outright winning young black New Yorkers and neighborhoods like Harlem and Flatbush. Andrew Cuomo and his super PAC spent more than $31 million. That's about $87 per vote. We were focused on affordability and it cost us only $19 bucks per vote. But what you did for us was worth so much more than what money could buy. The result, we shattered everyone's expectations, including our own. A Cuomo spokesperson put it best, saying they had not foreseen our ability to quote, "expand the electorate in such a way that no turnout model or poll was able to capture." Conventional wisdom says the left can only win low turnout elections. We rewrote the rule book by, get this, talking to New Yorkers. Politics in this city won't ever be the same, and it's all thanks to you. The next chapter begins today, New York.
