[Music] At 2 p.m. on October 26th, 1916, the Vice Squad raided this unassuming building behind me. It took only a few minutes for officers to emerge, their arms full of confiscated contraceptives. Trailing them were three women in handcuffs, protesting loudly. One of them was FA Mandel. The Brownsville Clinic had been open for all of 10 days before it was shut down. But those 10 days were historic. This was the first birth control clinic in America. Its very existence was revolutionary. The women arrested were the clinic's founders. Two of them were wellknown, Ethel Burn and her sister Margaret Sanger, who later founded Planned Parenthood before embracing eugenics. But few know about their partner FA, a 22-year-old woman freshly arrived from Minsk. Not yet an American citizen. Mandel was fluent in the Yiddish that many women spoke on these streets, and she translated pamphlets into words they could understand. When over 100 women visited the clinic on its opening day, it was because Mandel had shown them the way. In 1916, Brownsville was one of the poorest neighborhoods in New York. Birth control and abortion were illegal, and unwanted pregnancies were common among the young immigrants who lived here. Those who walked through the clinic's doors were taking a huge risk, but they had nowhere else to turn. 109 years later, Brownsville has changed. Instead of Jewish and Italian immigrants, this community is predominantly black today. Yet much remains the same. Brownsville is the poorest neighborhood in Brooklyn. And still, too many mothers have nowhere to turn. No neighborhood has a higher rate of pregnancy associated deaths than Brownsville. 146.9 of every 100,000 live births. That pain isn't limited to East Brooklyn. Black women in New York are nine times more likely to die of pregnancy related causes than white women. None of this is accidental. While FA Mandel extended care to all New Yorkers, others like Sanger believed that only some people were fit to have children. The racism that clouded the birth control movement permeated deep into maternal health. To this day, we reckon with the lasting toll it inflicted. We have the power to stop this suffering. My administration will provide new mothers with baby baskets proven to improve health outcomes and expand home visit programs to coordinate postpartum care and will make midwives and doula care more accessible. After FA Mandel was driven to jail, I imagine a heavy silence hung low here at 46 Amboy Street. It was the silence of a question unanswered. Who now would look out for those struggling the most? We can answer that question in our time together.
