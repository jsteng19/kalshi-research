As the sun goes down tonight, the days of awe begin for our Jewish friends and neighbors, Yamim norim, the high holy days begin with Rashashana when the Jewish calendar turns to the year 5786. That number alone speaks of the endurance of this faith over millennia. Its resilience despite wave after wave of persecution. As we celebrate Rashashana, the sounds of the chauffar will echo across every corner of our city. From Brighton Beach to Williamsburg to Riverdale, families will gather to dip apples into honey. Yum Kapoor will soon follow. On this holiest of days, Jewish New Yorkers will pause to reflect, to atone, and do the hard work of looking inwards. It is a tradition we could all do well to emulate, to build a city that feels sweet and learns from what did not work in the past, where we are not afraid to admit our failings and to grow accordingly, and where above all, every New Yorker is safe and cherished by the city they love. Shaatva New York. Have a sweet new year.
