Landlords are doing just fine. We have a report that has just come out that shows that landlord profit is up by 12%. When we are saying that we must freeze the rent, we're saying that we see these profits happening at the same time as the struggles of tenants. There are more than 2 million New Yorkers who live in rent stabilized housing. When you raise the rent on those New Yorkers, you push them to the brink. And that is a choice. A choice that Eric Adams has made and a choice that Andrew Cuomo will make. And I am running and we are running to make a different choice. We will choose to keep tenants in their homes because that is our responsibility to keep our neighbors in their homes, to keep these families together, and to keep this city what it is. I want to hear you so your landlord can hear you. We're running to freeze up. To freeze up. To freeze up. Thank you so much. Let's build this together. [Music]
