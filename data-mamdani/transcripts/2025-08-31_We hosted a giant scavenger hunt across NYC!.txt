[Music] Thousands of Zuran Mom Donnie supporters took to the streets on Sunday. They were taking part in a scavenger hunt. The hunt was part walking tour, part history lesson with clues leading to landmarks named after former New York City mayors. >> Those who solved the puzzle will receive a prize this evening. >> To begin the hunt, meet us in front of the Gilded Age Hall where that mayor spent a lot of his time. He was fresh and everyone else was tired whether from running against him or running on this track named after him. Who's to say John Ven East River Park? All right, let's go. >> We disagree with this former mayor on most things, but we're happy to be in the same boat with him on free public transit. >> Meet us outside the Manhattan Terminal where you'll find a city's shiny example of free transit. >> Juliani made the Staten Island Fairy free, so that's exactly Staten Island Ferry for sure. [Music] I am a member of NYC DSA, but I would not be the first member to be elected mayor. Find your next clue at the building named after the man who was. You'll be doing us a really big favor. >> And we're heading to the next location, Mayor David Dinkens Municipal Building. >> We saw today what this campaign is all about, which is a love of New York City. >> I feel like it's been so good sometimes to be like on your phones and so having a day like this is it's been amazing. I'm sweaty, but it's been amazing. You cannot serve a city. You cannot fight for a city if you do not love that city. Now on five, >> find your next clue in the park named for the mayor who led the city as it was roaring before it all came crashing down. >> Which New York City mayor said, >> "If you agree with me on nine out of 12 issues, vote for me." >> Adjacent to a bridge named for him, Ed Cotch. >> Oh, and yes, see a psychiatrist. >> Oh, Tramway Plaza. >> Oh, yeah. Yeah. I'm a born and raised New Yorker. It's like reminded me all the different places they've been to. Really cool. Travel to another burrow to this cafe to end the hunt. [Music] >> The last stop, the Little Flower Cafe. A salute to Mayor LaGuardia in Manny's Atoria neighborhood. [Music] >> Hello. >> All right. Good to see you again. be >> somebody who's says, you know, all of us matter, not just the folks that can tell us how their portfolios are going. That's cool. I'm for him. >> As New Yorkers joined us, whether by walking or using public transit, they got to see what has been evident to so many of us for so long. >> The last trip, >> which is that politics is not something that you have, it is something that you do. [Applause] And it's something where you can meet new friends, you can rediscover old ones, and you understand that above all to deliver the city that is currently the most expensive in the United States of America into one that each and every New Yorker can afford, it is something that we will do together. Thank you so much. Thank you guys. We out.
