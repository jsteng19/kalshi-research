The World Cup's coming to New York next year, and as a lifelong, sorry, soccer fan, I couldn't be more excited. But are any workingclass New Yorkers actually going to be able to watch the matches? Pre-sale starts tomorrow and for the first time, FIFA is using dynamic pricing where they're going to figure out in real time how much they can get away with for charging a ticket. The tickets can be resold on an official FIFA platform with no price cap. That means you can buy a ticket for 60 bucks and sell it for $6,000. And unlike the last three World Cups, there's nothing set aside for residents. What this all means is the biggest sporting event in the world is happening in your backyard and you'll be priced out of it. That's why I'm calling all soccer fans to go to zaharanfornyc.com/gameover greed to demand FIFA and dynamic pricing, place a cap on resale prices, and set aside 15% of tickets for local residents at a discount. Let's call this price gouging what it is.
