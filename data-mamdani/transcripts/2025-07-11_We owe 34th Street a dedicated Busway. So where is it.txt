This is 14th Street in a city with the slowest buses in the country. It's an oasis of quick commutes. That's because in 2019, New York City made this into a busway. Most of the day, only buses, trucks, and emergency vehicles can travel along 14th Street. Cars making local trips can get to the curb and garages, but they have to turn off at the next available right. The results have been transformative. Bus speeds increased by up to 47%. Ridership jumped by 30%. And crashes and injuries have plummeted. But here on 34th Street, buses crawl at an abysmal 3 m an hour. That's slower than a tourist walks through Midtown. We love you. Please keep coming to visit New York City. 28,000 daily riders on cross town buses are trapped by congestion, confusion, and chaos. So, the Department of Transportation had a great idea. Let's bring the success of the 14th Street busway here. It's not a new proposal. Mayor Bloomberg first suggested it in 2008. And this summer, it was supposed to finally happen. Three community boards voted overwhelmingly in favor. Elected officials are all on board. And then Eric Adams pulled the plug. It's a familiar tale under this mayor. Time and again, he's interfered to delay, water down, or outright cancel street redesign projects that would make moving around our city safer, faster, and more enjoyable. Why does he do this? Did a donor give him a call? Was he feuding with a local elected official with Eric Adams? You never really know. But this mismanagement is a big reason why the mayor is woefully behind on implementing the streets plan passed in 2019. That law mandated the city build at least 150 miles of new protected bus lanes between 2022 and 2026, 30 miles per year. And what's Adams averaging? Fewer than eight. Speeding up buses isn't complicated. It doesn't cost much. You don't need Albany. All the tools are in the power of city hall. We just need a mayor who'll deliver for the more than 1 million New Yorkers who ride the bus every day. And that's exactly who I'll be.
