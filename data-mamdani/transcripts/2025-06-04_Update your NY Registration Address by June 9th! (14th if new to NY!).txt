If you're not Andrew Cuomo, keep scrolling. Andrew, I know you're bad with deadlines and moving to a new city is stressful. But there's an important election coming up and we're trying to fix the crisis you created. If you want to vote, you only have a week left to change your registration from Westchester to New York City. I know, I know you're shy. I assume that's why you've been hiding all campaign, but it's important to make your voice heard. I know what you're thinking. If you're not a disgraced former governor and you're still watching, does it apply to you? If you're a registered Democrat, absolutely. If you're already registered to vote here in New York, but need to change your address, you got to do it by June 9th. If you lived in Atoria, but now you live in Bay Ridge, changing your registration means getting to vote at the poll site closest to you. And if you just got here, or you've lived here for decades, but still vote in California or New Jersey, you got until June 14th. But don't wait. Head to zeronfornyc.com/vote because we've got an affordable city to win. Stop voting in New Jersey.
