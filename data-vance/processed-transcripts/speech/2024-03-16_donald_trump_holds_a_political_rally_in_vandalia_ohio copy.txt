It's good to see you, man. Thank you. Thank you. First of all, I got to say the teleprompter really does look like hell here. The president is telling the truth here. But, look, let me let me say something. It's a real statistic, sir. I look this up. Do you know that all of the net job growth under Biden's presidency has gone to the foreign born, and Donald Trump's presidency, the job growth went to American citizens.

Let's rebuild prosperity for America's citizens and reelect Donald J. Trump. I know he loves this country. I know he loves the state of Ohio, and I know he loves Bernie Moreno. Let's help Donald Trump out, elect Bernie Moreno, and elect Donald Trump in 2024. God bless you, sir.
