Are we having a good time? Is it great to have the president back in Ohio? Look, here's the thing about this crazy, lying fraud Tim Ryan. His whole attack against me is that I'm out of state, I'm from California. Even though the reason I left the state when I was 18 years old was to enlist in the United States Marine Corps and go and serve my country.

But the president may not even know this, Tim Ryan has not one, but two books on yoga and meditation. Tim Ryan has called to ban gas powered cars and Tim Ryan has voted for the Green New Deal. Who's from California, Tim? It sounds like you are. Look, this is simple. We got to get back to common sense.

We got to stop hiring 87,000 IRS agents.

We got to fire those guys and hire some border patrol agents. And we got to go back to the policies that this guy delivered that made this state free and prosperous and secure. Let's do it. November 8th, let's do it ladies and gentlemen. God bless you.
