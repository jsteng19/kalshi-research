I'm sure we'll talk about Russia, Ukraine, as well, but Mr. Foreign Secretary, it's good to see you. Welcome. Thank you.

That's right.

Wonderful. Well, we're looking forward to it. Thank you, all. Good to see you.

Take care, guys.

Good evening, everybody. How are we doing? Are we ready to make America great again? I just want to say we're so grateful to all of you. So grateful for making sure that we made this election too big to rig because that's exactly what we did. And we did it together. And, of course, I want to thank my dear friend and I think the best president that this country has had, a man -- A man who has put everything on the line for the United States of America and gets an opportunity to serve this great country once again, President Donald J. Trump.

So, do we want to hear from the 45th and 47th President of the United States? Take it away, sir.
