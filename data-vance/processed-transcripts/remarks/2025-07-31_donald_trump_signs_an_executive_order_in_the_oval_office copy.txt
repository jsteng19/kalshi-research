OK, sure. Well, thank you all. And thanks to the president for setting up this important commission. Thanks to all the great athletes for lending their credibility to it. I think all of us who have young kids at home just know that kids are healthier, they're happier, they do better when they're out there.

They're being active, they're playing in sports. They're hanging out with their friends. I think all of us have thought at one point in the last few years that kids spend a little too much time on their phones, maybe a little bit too much time in front of the TV. And we just want kids to do better. We want them to be healthier, we want them to be happier.

And we know that getting out there playing in sports and being active and healthy and physically fit is a critical part of this. So, all due credit to the president and Secretary Kennedy's leadership. This is all about just making our kids better citizens, better people and happier in their daily lives. And I think this is a great team to get it accomplished.

Thank you, sir.
