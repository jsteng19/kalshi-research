-- Pretty good, sir.

That's right.

Well, sure, Mr. President. Thank you and thanks to Johnny for being here. We're very thrilled about the World Cup. Just to echo something the president said about crime in Washington D.C. This is the national capital of the greatest nation in the world. And we had murder rates just a few weeks ago that rivaled some of the worst third world cities anywhere, even in very, very poor regions of the world.

Why did we accept that? Why did we allow it to happen? We allowed it to happen because we had broken leadership in Washington D.C. and unfortunately, sitting behind the resolute desk. What we have shown in just under two weeks of taking law enforcement seriously is that the American people could have their streets back if their leadership is willing to put in the time and the resources.

Mr. President, you've shown in Washington D.C. that we can have safe streets again, we've just got to have the political willpower to focus on the bad guys and to give the American people back their communities. We are focused on doing that thanks to the president's leadership.
