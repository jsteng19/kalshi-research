Yes, sir. Yeah, that's great.

I'm short compared to these guys, sir.

Thank you, all.

Well, thank you, Mr. President. Thanks to Coach Day and the entire team for being here at the White House. I am so proud to be part of team scarlet and gray today. Congratulations to the Ohio State Buckeyes on a hell of a 2024 season. Now, I want to say just a couple of words about this team because they really helped make, sir, an incredible year even better for this very proud Ohio State alum.

So two things. First of all, I made a bet with Ted Cruz over the Texas game, a bet that he is still not paid up on. Ted Cruz, if you're watching on TV. And I don't like losing any bet, but I really don't want to lose a bet to Ted Cruz, so thank you all for helping me win that bet against Ted Cruz.

And the second thing I asked the president on January the 20th, I said, sir, would you mind if I skipped that final inaugural ball to go to the Ohio State national championship game. And the president said, no, but we'll have them at the White House. So, here we are celebrating that national title, and I just want to say I'm proud of you guys.

You guys were resilient. You were tough. You represented the state of Ohio well, and you represented the whole country well. And the last thing that I'll say is, I don't know who let the guy over in the corner here in a Michigan hat into this celebration. But I'm about --  I'm about to tell the Secret Service you've got a dangerous weapon, sir.  But I just want to say proud of this team.

Mr. President, thank you for hosting and thanks to the whole state of Ohio for showing up and cheering for our Buckeyes. God bless you guys.
