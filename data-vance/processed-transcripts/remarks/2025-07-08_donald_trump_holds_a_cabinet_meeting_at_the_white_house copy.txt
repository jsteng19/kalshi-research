Well, thank you, Mr. President. I just want to say that I'm very proud of the whole team. I think everybody has worked together. You see Pete and Marco and Steve working on some of the diplomacy, Kristi and Pam working on the border. We just have a really, really solid team and we've done a lot of good work.

And in particular, I want to congratulate the White House staff led by the president on getting the One Big, Beautiful Bill passed. I was personally skeptical, sir. I never told you this, but I was skeptical we'd be able to get that thing done by July 4th. We did it because we worked together and we worked very well.

So, it's an honor to be a part of it, but I'm really proud of you guys for doing a great job.
