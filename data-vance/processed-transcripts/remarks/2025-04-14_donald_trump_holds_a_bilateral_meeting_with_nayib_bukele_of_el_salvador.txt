Yes, sir. I mean, look, for 40 years, we have lost manufacturing capacity. Workers have seen their wages stagnate. And some of the most critical things that we need from the pharmaceuticals, the drugs that we give to our children, the antibiotics that we give to our kids to the weapons that we actually need to fight a war, if, God forbid, we had to fight a War. We don't make enough of that stuff.

And so, President Trump ran explicitly on changing that. Yes, as the president mentioned, it caused a little bit of disruption in the market. But I actually think over the long term, workers are going to benefit, stocks are going to go up, American businesses are going to benefit as we reinvest and reindustrialize our country.

Very big day.
