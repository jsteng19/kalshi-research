All right. is that everybody? OK. Uh, well, welcome, everybody. We're of course pleased to be joined by the delegation from NATO, especially Secretary General Rutte. Thank you for -- for being here. Uh, this is actually our second meeting. The first right before the inauguration and uh, the second now here at the Munich Security Conference.

Of course, we're going to talk about NATO and particularly the president's desire to see NATO spend a little bit more resources on defense. And I know that's something Secretary General Rutte agrees with me on. Uh, we're going to talk of course about the Ukraine-Russia conflict and how to bring it to a negotiated settlement.

And I'm sure we'll talk about some other areas of cooperation, too. I mean, my -- my high-level argument to -- to -- to these folks is, look, Europe is, of course, a very important ally in the United States. NATO is a very important military alliance of course that we're the most significant part of, but we want to make sure that NATO is actually built for the future.

And we think a big part of that is ensuring that NATO does a little bit more, uh, burden sharing in Europe so that the United States can focus on some of our challenges in East Asia. So, we'll have a good conversation. We have great people here, and we're thrilled to have them.

Perfect. Likewise. Good to see you. Thank you. All right. Thank you, all. Good to see you guys.
