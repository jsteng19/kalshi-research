Thank you.

Great. Thank you, uh, Prime Minister Meloni, who's become a good friend of mine, and uh, we're -- I know -- I speak for the president when I say we're both big fans of yours and of course of Italy. Uh, the people of Italy have been most gracious, especially today, which was a beautiful ceremony.

And all credit goes to the Vatican, but of course, your government for making it possible for so many foreign leaders to come in and celebrate Pope Leo's inaugural mass. Of course, an American pope. Uh, the United States is very proud of him, very thrilled with him, and certainly our prayers go with him as he starts this very important work.

Uh, I'm looking forward to this conversation. I think uh, one of the things that Prime Minister Meloni has offered to do, and of course, the president and I are excited to accept, uh, is really to -- to -- to be a bridge builder I think in some ways between Europe and the United States. I have said repeatedly that I think Europe is an important ally of the United States.

The individual countries within Europe are important allies of the United States. But of course, we have some disagreements as friends sometimes do on issues like trade, and we also have many agreements and many things that we can work on together. And I'm looking forward to this conversation. So, I appreciate Prime Minister Meloni's hospitality.

I appreciate Commissioner von der Leyen being here and being willing to engage in this conversation. I think we'll have a great conversation and hopefully will be the beginning of some long-term trade negotiations and some long-term trade advantages between both Europe and the United States.

Sure.

Sure.

Thank you, all. Take care.
