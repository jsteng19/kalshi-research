thank you
Kenosha I didn't know there were this many people in
kosha wow what a crowd and by the way we got another thousand people in the
Overflow area
let me thank uh the University of Wisconsin Parkside for the venue let me
thank canel and pulse LLC for the music Laura Jane Grace for the
music Lori Ellen Randy and Congressman Mark ban for their great remarks
[Applause]
[Applause] well you know it is great to be in
Wisconsin the state that has the second best cheddar cheese in
America just kidding just kidding
so why am I here tonight well because
it's great to see all of you that's why I'm here but the answer I think as Mark and the
others have said is pretty obvious uh as most Americans know we are
living in a pivotal and dangerous moment
in American history and we are facing unprecedented
challenges the world is Shifting rapidly every day something new shifts ing
rapidly under our feet and how we respond to all that is going on right
now will impact not only our lives but the lives of our kids and future
generations and in terms of the planet and climate change it will depend what
we do now will determine whether the planet actually survives
so we are here to say loudly and clearly that in
our great nation we will not accept
alari we will not accept authoritarianism
we will not accept
kleptocracy we're here to make it clear that we're going to fight back and we
are going to [Applause]
win you know lately lately I have been thinking about
something that I learned I guess in the fifth or sixth grade and also in Vermont on Memorial
Day I often go to a beautiful parade done by the city of virens which is up in the northern part of the state and
it's a great parade and what they do at the end of the parade many many hundreds of people come to the town green and we
give speeches and stuff and they bring kids from the high school up to speak
and every year they a kid from the high school reciting the Gettysburg Address
that Abraham Lincoln gave uh in in
1863 and I want you all I think you all remember what that was about Lincoln
stood there a few days after the terrible terrible bloody Battle of
Gettysburg where thousands and thousands of soldiers died to end the horror of
slavery see still on that bfield and he looked around him and this is what he said he said that we here highly
resolved that these dead shall not have died in vain and that this nation under God
shall have a new birth of freedom and that the government of the
People by the people for the people shall not perish from the Earth
[Applause]
well brothers and sisters that is precisely why I'm here in kosha tonight
to do my best along with you to see that a government of the People by the people
for the people shall not perish from the [Applause]
earth and I got to tell you that this is not going to be an easy fight and I want
to tell you what we are up against I want you to think back some six or so
weeks ago when Trump was inaugurated for his second term
now if you remember that I was there I was sorry it was my job I had to go I
was kind of right I got pushed right up front so it's a few feet away and standing right behind Trump as he took
his oath of office were the three wealthiest men in America you remember
that Elon Musk
Mr Bezos and Mark
Zuckerberg but it's not just that the three wealthiest people in America are
right behind them because right behind them there were 13 other billionaires
who Trump had nominated to head major government
[Music] agencies and I don't care whether you're a Democrat a Republican or an
independent you're conservative Progressive whatever you are there you
had president Trump telling the whole world that that administration his
administration is a government of the billionaire class by the billionaire
class and for the billionaire class
and that is what we are taking on people with endless
wealth my friends for years I have been talking about how America has been
moving toward an oligarchy well we're no longer moving
toward that oligarchy today we are living in that oligarchy and we say no
[Applause]
and as we speak literally right now the oligarchs led by Mr musk the wealthiest
man on Earth are on the war path against the Working Families of our
country despite there this is something that really I struggle with to think
about these guys are worth more money than we can almost dream of what does it mean to be worth $110 billion 100
billion in most case $400 billion they're worth unbelievable they can take
care of their families for a hundred Generations all right they have endless
amounts of money now all of you know that in Vermont and in
Wisconsin we have very serious addiction problems
right we got people horribly with seeing drug drug overdoses people who are
addicted to drugs addicted to alcohol alcoholism serious problem we got
tobacco addiction we got food addiction we got a lot of addiction in this country but I will tell you the most
serious addiction that we have is that we are looking at an
addiction of greed on the part of the ruling class of this country
this is honestly I believe this this is not an economic issues we can talk about it from an economic perspective this is
more of a psychiatric issue these people who are already
enormously wealthy cannot control themselves think about a heroin addict
needs more and more and more that's what their body is craving and that is what these guys want they have billions they
want more billions and they do not care about who they step on in order to
become richer and right now in order to make
themselves even wealthier they want to dismember the federal government and cut
programs the lowincome and working people desperately
need and you know why they are doing that they want to cut these programs so
that they can give the 1% $1.1 trillion in tax
[Music] breaks now how do they do that what's
their plan well their plan is to cut Medicaid by
$880 billion now what does that mean it means that
millions of kids will be thrown off of the health care that they have it means
as Mark ban mentioned a moment ago that when nursing homes get 2third of their
funding from Medicaid that if you have a mom or a dad that is in or needs to be
in a nursing home it's going to be really hard because nursing homes all over this country are to be closing
down it means that if you go to a community health center 32 million
people do that they are going to be unable to provide you the care that you need because 40% of their revenue comes
from Medicaid but that is not all that they
are now attempting to do it's not just cutting Medicaid they are now going
after social
Security in America today
202% of seniors are trying to survive on $15,000 a year or less you tell me how
anybody can survive on $15,000 I don't care whether you are in Wisconsin
Vermont or any place all right you got 50% of senior is trying to get by on
$330,000 a year right now because of the
inadequate funding of the Social Security Administration they are underst
staffed right now some 30,000 people die every year waiting for
understaff Social Security to approve disability benefits can you believe that
that's what we got now and musk's plan to cut social security staff by
50% will result in the deaths of thousands and thousands of seniors who
will never be able to get on the phone and talk to somebody and get the benefits that they paid into and that
they deserve as American citizens
but it's not just it's not just Medicaid and health care for kids and it's not
just Social Security they are going after Veterans as
well you know I some years ago had the honor and it really was an honor to be
the chairman of the Senate veterans committee and I worked as hard as I
could and I really don't care what your political view is I think almost every
American understands that when men and women put their lives on the line to defend this
country we got to stand with them and make sure they get the benefits that they were [Applause]
promised and just a few days ago the Trump Administration announced
that they were going to lay off
83,000 employees at the Veterans
Administration they're going to gut the Department of Veterans Affairs
jeopardizing the health and well-being of millions of veterans
today it's not just me today the Veterans of Foreign Wars issued a
statement and I quote We Now call upon VA to
reconsider its planned reduction of 83,000 employees and thoroughly review
any proposed Cuts prior to Rolling Out further announcements like this end of course I stand with the
VFW no cuts to the [Applause]
VA Trump and musk want to dismantle the Department of
Education so let me tell you what that means it means that 27 million kids in lowincome and
workingclass communities all over this country will see those schools lose
funding those schools are struggling now and the situation will only get worse
right now all over America lowincome workingclass kids are trying to figure out they want to get a higher education
they have the dream of going to college well they're going to kill the pel grant
program as well and on top of all of this is part
of their effort to cut programs so that they can give tax breaks to billionaires
they want to go after nutrition programs to the tune of
$230 [Music] billion and I I you know I
don't you know these are people these billionaires they live in incredible
opulence they own you know homes and they got jet planes and they got yachts
and they you know send their kids to fancy schools they go up in space in
their spaceships and
imagine imagine just imagine for a moment the vulgarity of these people
with so much wealth trying to get another tax break by cutting nutrition
programs for Hungry kids that is truly disgusting
now one of the ways that you can dismantle the federal government is the
fire which they are doing hundreds of thousands of federal
employees so that programs that these people work on cannot be implemented if
you don't have anybody working at the Social Security Administration you don't have a program people are not answering
the phones they're not getting the checks out no Staffing no programs
and I want to say something else in terms of what's Happening Now now when we look at all of
these layoffs Trump just arbitrarily arbitrarily going around don't care how
many years you worked don't really care about the quality of your work you're out now some people may say well you
know that's really bad I I know that lives are going to be hurt people had hoped to get decent retirement people
can't pay their mortgages what's going to happen to all all these workers we're concerned about that but I want you all
to understand this people like musk are working day and night trying to expand
artificial intelligence and
Robotics think for a moment if they are able to help the Skelter throw hundreds
of thousands of federal employees out on the street what do you think they will
do with the explosion of artificial intelligence and Robotics that we will
soon see do you think they give a damn about workers who will be
impacted so whatever you may think about the federal government let me tell you they're coming for your job as well and
our view is that technology is good if it works for workers not just for CEOs
and Elon Musk [Applause]
[Music] [Applause]
technology opens the opportunity for a shorter work
week and we have got to stand together I introduced the bill last year for a 32-hour work
week with no loss of pay because what we have seen over the last
50 Years is as worker productivity has exploded people are
producing much much more it's not workers who have benefited from that it is the
1% now one of the tools that the alari is using right now
it's something that we have really never seen uh in our country's history uh I will
not be telling you any secrets that politicians historically lie
occasionally it has happened once or twice people stretch the truth
occasionally it happens but what we have never seen is the use of the big lie the
big lie in a way that we are seeing it right
now as we heard in his speech to Congress just a few days
ago president Trump is very effective in creating what I would call a parallel
universe stay with me here for a minute okay and that is a set of
ideas that either have no basis in reality absolute lies or in the great
scheme of things they are nowhere near the most important
concerns facing the American people and what these guys do and this
is new this is new in America it really is and what they do is they say
something that is grossly false they repeat it over and over again and then
they have their right-wing social media blasted out endless times until people
actually believe it and then what happens is that rather
than addressing the real issues and debating the real issues facing our
country we find ourselves wasting endless amounts of time trying to refute
Trump's absurdities and lies let me give you just a let me give
you just a few examples Trump claimed has claimed over and over again that the 2020 elections was stolen
from him and that he won by a lamps
slide a lie Trump has claim that the January 6th
Insurrection was a day of
Love AE Trump has claimed that millions of
undocumented people vote in American elections a
lie Trump has claim that climate change is a hoax originating in China a
lie Trump very recently has claimed that Ukraine started the horrific war with
Russia a lie but it's not just Trump Elon Musk
defeated a very important bill before Trump took office by claiming that that
legislation which had been worked on because I was involved in it for months by Democrats and Republicans fighting
arguing finally came to what we call a continuing resolution which included some very important Health Care
Provisions that I had worked on and he said you gotta defeat that bill because
it's giving a 40% wage increase salary increase to members of Congress a total absolute
lie was a 3.4% increase not a 40% increase and this week in his speech to
Congress Trump once again repeated the claim that musk started that zillions
and zillions of dead people between the ages of 100 and 300
100 are receiving Social Security
checks now why are they doing that this is an outrageous
lie and in my view he does this in order to lay the groundwork for cuts to Social
Security and in fact dismantling the most successful and popular and
important program in American history and that is so what the goals
and I want you all to know it if you disparage a program and you say to
people all things it's fraud it's fraud it's terribly run people going to say well gee why do we keep this program
that is their goal and we're not going to let them get away with that because we know that millions and millions of
seniors are kept out of poverty because of Social Security we're not going to let them destroy
[Applause]
it now it's a funny thing and this is again what they do they try to deflect
attention away from the most important issues facing Americans and we cannnot
for for I give you an example again at is State of the Union speech on Tuesday
if you listened hard and I was right there up
front this speech if you listened hard had virtually nothing to say about the
State of the Union it went on for a 100 minutes I think it was the longest speech in the
history of speeches to Congress and yet somehow after a hundred minutes he
ignored virtually every major issue facing the working class of this
[Music] [Applause]
country so let us do for a moment what Trump and his friends do not do let us
have the courage to take a hard look at the State of the Union where the
American people are today and I'll start off by saying that in the richest country in the history of
the world there is something profoundly wrong with our economy when 60% of our people are
living paycheck to [Applause]
paycheck now unlike Donald Trump I grew up in a family that lived
paycheck the paycheck and I grow up in a rent controlled apartment so I know
something about living paycheck to paycheck and what that means as many of
you know is that today millions of Americans worry about how they're going
to pay their rents they worry about how they're going to afford child care they worry what's
going to happen if their kid get sick or their mom or dad can't afford prescription
drugs they worry about what happens when the car breaks down you need to put
$1,000 to get the car going if you don't have the thousand bucks you can't get to work if you can't get to work you lose
your job if you lose your job what the hell happens to your
family millions of people today are worried about how they can
afford to purchase healthy food for their kids when the price of food is all
the charts funny I didn't hear one word from
Donald Trump about the economic realities facing 60% of our people or the enormous stress
that they are living under but that is not all today in
America everybody knows that our Health Care system is broken am I
right we spend twice as much per capita on health care but the goal of this
system is simply to make the insurance companies and the drug companies
rich not to provide the care that Working Families need we remain and
we've got to end we Remain the only major country on Earth not to guarantee
Health Care to all people as a human
right now I listened to Trump I listened to Trump for over an hour and a half and
he had not one word not one word to say about an issue that torments tens of
millions of people the outrageously High Cost of Health Care in America nor did I
hear the president talk about how one out of four Americans cannot afford the
prescription drugs their doctors
prescrib I hope you all know that we pay the highest prices in the world for
prescription drugs in some cases 10 times more for the same exact drug as
Canadians or Europeans or the Japanese F but somehow or another
despite an hour and a half of talk not one word about prescription drugs but it's not only healthc care that he
forgot to talk about today in America we got 800,000 people who are
homeless we have over 20 million people spending more than 50% of their limited
incomes on housing we have a major housing crisis
in Vermont California all over this country Trump did not have one word to
say about how we're going to resolve
it today in America we have more income and wealth inequality than we have ever
had in the history of our nation the three wealthiest people in America the
people standing right behind Trump at its inauguration own more wealth than
the bottom half of American society 170 million
people did you hear Trump say one word about addressing this massive level of
income and wealth inequality which gets to the very fabric of our
society and here's something else that Trump forgot to
discuss not only is our life expectancy four years lower you all know
that's four years lower than other wealthy countries around the world you all know that that is really bad but you
know what's even more outrageous and that is that the life expectancy for the
bottom 50% of Americans is 7 years short
than for the wealthy people in this country got
that now I want you to think about that that means if you're in the working class you're lowincome on average you're
going to live seven years shorter life than if you are wealthy why is
that Health Care is one of the reasons what's the other reason stress what does that mean
stress hold on one second all right this young man talked about
cardiovascular issues and hypertension what it means this is what stress means think about it if you are worrying today
you're a single mom worrying how you're going to feed your kids worrying about what happens if the landlord raises the
rent worrying about what happens if your car breaks down or some of the kids get sick what does that do to you if that's
on your mind day after day after day you're worried about losing your job what does that do to
you it destroys your mind and your body that's what it does stress kills and
what this young man was saying is true it has a physiological impact on human
life it is not acceptable that so many of our people are living under that kind
of stress we can deal with it we're the wealthiest Nation on Earth but that's
something that Mr Trump forgot to talk about
[Applause]
and scientists will tell you that climate change is an
existential threat to our planet an economist will tell you that
we can create millions of good paying jobs Transforming Our Energy System away
from from fossil fuel to Energy Efficiency and sustainable [Applause]
energy Trump in his hour and a half speech had not one word to say about the
crisis of climate change except drill baby drill which will make a bad
situation even worse so let us do something radical you
ready for a radical idea [Applause]
let us take a real look at what is going on in our country and I should tell you
that the problems we Face are not only domestic for the first time in two our
250y year history we have a president who is turning his back on democracy and
allying us with
authoritarianism no Mr Trump Ukraine did not start this war Russia
did no Mr President zalinski is not a
dictator Putin is [Applause]
we must not abandon the people of Ukraine who were invaded by Putin we
must always stand up for democracy not
[Applause] dictatorship but as we go forward in
this struggle it's not good enough to be on the defensive to take Trump on every day which is what we got to do we have
we got to do something else we have got to come up with the ideas and the agenda
that working people all over this country
[Applause] support and what I'm going to tell you
is not just a progressive idea it is an idea that poll after poll shows is
supported by the overwhelming majority of the American people the American people want us to end a corrupt campaign
Finance [Applause]
system we are not a democracy when billionaires like musk and others in
both political parties can buy elections [Applause]
it is apparently not enough and I want you to think hard about this that musk spent some
$270 million to help Trump get elected and his reward is that he was made the
most powerful person in the US government but it goes beyond that as
bad as that is the situation is so absurd that and musk is so arrogant that
he is even in intervening in a supreme court election right here in the state
of
Wisconsin against a candidate who has the very very extreme idea that maybe
women should be able to control their own bodies not the government [Applause]
now you know now whatever your view may be on this Supreme Court election I
think what everybody no matter what your position should be should make it clear
to the wealthiest person on Earth that he cannot buy an election here in
Wisconsin and I want you to think about what that means if this guy can
intervene in a supreme court election in one state you tell me what mayor's race
what Governor's race race what Senate race he cannot buy so we have got to deal with this
corrupt campaign Finance system we've got to overturn Citizens
[Applause]
United and we've got to move to Public Funding of Elections
[Applause] and again no matter what your political
view may be you're conservative you're Progressive nobody I know thinks that billionaires should be able to buy
elections furthermore we've got to move toward a tax system that is
fair no more tax breaks for billionaires
[Applause] when tens of millions of Americans are
working for starvation wages when the federal minimum wage is 7 and a quarter
an hour we've got to raise that wage to a living wage at least 17 bucks an
hour all over this country working people want to join unions
they understand that when you're in a union you got a shot at decent wages decent benefits decent working
conditions but mosque and basos and the billionaire class
continuously act in an illegal way to make it difficult or impossible for
workers to exercise their constitutional right to form a union that's why we got pass the pro act make it easier for
workers to join [Applause]
unions musk and Trump and these guys are in the business of cutting Social Security our view is that when millions
of seniors today are finding it hard to keep their homes warm or buy the food they need we're not going to cut Social
Security we're going to expand Social Security by lifting the cap on taxable [Applause]
income brothers and sisters we're not going to let them cut Medicaid we're
going to fight for Medicare for
all again whether you're Conservative Republican Progressive whatever you may
be people understand that whether you're rich or you're poor or you're middle class everybody needs healthare Health
Care is a human right not a [Applause]
privilege in a competitive global economy we need the best educated
Workforce in the world young people should not have to go
50 or $100,000 in debt to get the education they
[Applause] need all over the world countries
understand they want they need their kids to get a quality education that's why we've got to make public colleges
and universities tuition free and forgive student debt [Applause]
now I know there are a lot of people throughout our country who are feeling
angry and frustrated about what's going on in Washington
[Music] [Applause] right so let me say
this at this particular moment in history
despair is not an option giving up is not
acceptable none of us have the privilege of hiding under the covers as
much as we might want to do that the stakes for us for our kids for future
generations and for the planet is just too
high and in these difficult moments and they are
difficult let us never ever forget that real change only occurs when ordinary
people stand up against oppression and Injustice
[Applause]
and we all know we all know we all know this is not the first time that our
country has faced challenging and dangerous situation think about it I really want
you to think about this when this country was founded you had people in
the colonies taking on on the entire British Empire the most powerful force
on Earth they stood up they took on the king of England and
they
won and think about the people in the 1820s 1830s 1840s in the Abolitionist
Movement they said slavery is a human Abomination
and we're going to get rid of it and they have to take on everybody enormously powerful people and hundreds
of thousands of people died in that Civil War to make that happen but they
won slavery was [Applause]
abolished think about the struggle of the American Trade union
[Applause] movement think about workers who stood up and said we don't want children
working in factories we don't want to work seven days a
week we want to form a union and some of those workers were beaten up some of
them were killed many of them were fired but they fought back and won
think about Dr King in the civil rights
movement and all of those people who went to jail to fight segregation and
they won think about the women way back when
who went to jail and occasionally died because of the radical idea that women
should have the right to vote
[Applause] and they won and you think about the
environmental movement the gay rights movement and many other
movements so yes the oligarchs are enormously
powerful they control the economy they control our political
system to a large degree they have enormous influence over the
media but from the bottom of my heart I am convinced that they can be
beaten [Applause]
the American people have stood up to wealth and power in the past we can do
it today and we can beat [Applause]
them if we stand together and not let
Trump and his allies divide us up by the color of our skin or where we were born
or our religion or our sexual orientation if we bring our people
together if we create an agenda that works for all and not just the few
[Applause]
now I'm not a PhD in mathematics but I do know that 99% is a hell of a lot
bigger number than [Applause]
1% so let me conclude by saying this I hope very much that
[Music] what
oh all right you're right look I will be introducing I will be introducing
legislation very shortly to prevent any more funding for the Netanyahu
government to kill [Applause]
now we we did this a few months ago and to everybody's surprise you know despite
the enormous power of APAC and other powerful organizations we got 19
Senators to support I ban on arms sales
for Netanyahu [Applause]
and by the way and again you know there's so much to go over you forgive me there are many things I didn't
discuss but the idea the idea that Trump believes that he can forcibly expel
2.2 million people in Gaza who have suffered so
much in order to create a playground a Riviera for the rich is so abominable it
is literally [Applause]
unspeakable all right so here's what we're going to do we're not going to leave you guys alone we're going to keep
pestering you we hope you come out and you vote on that Supreme Court
[Applause] election we hope that you call your
Republic member of Congress here and tell them you know what the people of
Wisconsin in this District do not want tax breaks for billionaires and cuts the
Medicaid in [Applause]
education and you know what I think it would be a great idea for your Congressman to hold a town meeting right
[Applause] here it's called democracy
[Applause] so brothers and sisters thank you again this is a unbelievable turnout thank you
all for [Applause]
coming let's go forward together we're going to win this thing thank you
[Music] [Applause] power to
the power to
the e
