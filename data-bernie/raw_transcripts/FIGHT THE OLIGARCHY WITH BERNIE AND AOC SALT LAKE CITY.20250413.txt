Thank you, Utah.
Thank
you. You know, Alexandria mentioned a
moment ago that we were in LA yesterday
and we had 36,000 people out.
But in many ways, the 20,000 we have out
today is more
impressive. And we're here in
socalled conservative Utah. Tomorrow
we're going to be in
Idaho because we believe that in every
state of this country, people are
prepared to stand up and fight
back. Now, I want to say a
word about my daughter.
Now, I want to say a word about
Alexandria and
why why she's doing is so important. And
here's the story.
Six years
ago, six years ago, what were you doing
for a living? She was a waitress.
But she looked around
her and she saw a society that was
fundamentally unjust
and in many ways ugly to the people in
the community in which she lived, New
York City.
She stood up and took on one of the most
powerful people in the House of
Representatives and she started with
almost no money against the guy who had
unlimited funds and she beat
him.
Okay. Now, why do
I why do I tell you that story? It's not
just to talk about Alexandria. The point
that I am making is that in this arena
of 15,000 people, there are hundreds of
Alexandrias. There are hundreds of
Alex's and Joe's and Mary's and Cynths.
And all across this country, we are
going to need people to go outside of
their comfort zone
cuz the
establishment, man, they are smart. They
are so smart. And one of the smartest
things they do and one of the most
effective things they do is to say to
all of you and working people all over
America, hey, we got the money. We got
the power. We own it all. You ain't
nothing nothing you're going to do about
it. And a lot of people sit back and
they say, "What am I going to do?" Can't
do nothing. All right. My boss's going
to fire me. this that and the other
thing. And that is the
mindset we have got to break through.
A,
but it's not AOC and it's not Bernie. It
is
you. You don't
need leaders. We need a mass movement of
millions of people.
Now, the
reason that Alexandria and I have been
running around the country is because,
as all of you
know, and she so eloquently
stated, we are living in the most
dangerous moments uh in the modern
history of this country. And I really,
especially for the young people, I wish
I could not have to tell you that. You
know, but it is just simply
true. We are living in a moment where a
handful of
billionaires control our
government. You know, for many years I
have been talking about oligarchy and
American. People said, "Well, yeah, you
know, Bernie, Bernie had just given a
speech.
But anybody I have to thank you know
Trump for educating the American people
about what oligarchy is.
You know, we we we can talk about it as
an abstraction, but when Trump gets
inaugurated and standing right behind
him and I had the remarkable, unreal,
surreal experience of being in the front
row just like you guys
are. I got pushed into that. I don't
know how, but there I
was. And there's Trump taking the oath
of office. Right behind him are the
three wealthiest people in
America, Mr. Musk, Mr. Bezos, and Mr.
Zuckerberg.
And if that is not enough to make you
understand that we're living in an
oligarchy, right behind them were 13
other billionaires that Trump had
nominated to head up major federal
agencies.
And then then it's not only that we are
living in a oligarchy and have a
government of billionaires. I mean
that's bad. You know I was thinking
recently I wish that I had been a better
student in the sixth grade of American
history.
But I remember and many of you will
remember Abraham Lincoln in 1863 in
Gettysburg. You remember what he said?
This is what he said. He was looking out
on the field, the battlefield. He had
came come there just a few days after
the terrible battle where
20,000 Union soldiers fighting slavery,
fighting to end slavery had either died
or been wounded. 20,000 soldiers. And he
looked out on that
field and this is what he
said. He said that we here highly
resolve that these dead shall not have
died in vain.
that this nation under
God shall have a new birth of freedom.
And then you remember what he said. And
that government of the people
shall not perish from the earth.
And that's why we're here.
We do not want a government of the
billionaire class by the billionaire
class for the billionaire class. We want
a government that represents all of us,
not just the 1%.
We don't want the richest guy on earth
running all over Washington DC throwing
tens of thousands of dedicated federal
workers out on the street.
slashing the Social Security
Administration so that elderly, disabled
people are going to find it really hard
to get the information they need to
access Social
Security. We don't want Mr. Musk and his
friends proposing to lay off
83,000 employees at the Veterans
Administration. We believe that the men
and women who have put their lives on
the line to defend this country deserve
the highest quality healthcare.
We don't want Mr. Musk and his friends
running around slashing US aid.
You know, some of the proudest things I
think we feel is when we know our
government has done things to help the
poorest people on earth, children who
who die of preventable
diseases. That's what makes us a great
country. And what makes all of this
stuff even
worse is that all of these cuts to
social security, to the VA, to US ID,
etc., etc., they are designed to do one
thing, and that is to give massive tax
breaks to the top 1%.
At a time when our health care system is
already
broken, they want to cut Medicaid by
$880 billion
dollar. They want to cut nutrition
programs for hungry
kids so they can give Mr. Musk and the
other billionaires a huge tax
break. The power of the billionaire
class exists not only in the economy
today. We have an economy with more
concentration of ownership than we have
ever had in the history of this country.
You know what that means? It means that
in sector after sector of our economy, a
handful of large corporations control
what's produced and how much you pay for
those
products. And that is why in many
instances prices are so high. But they
control not only the economy, they also
control our corrupt campaign finance
system.
Now, I want you to think about it. I
want you to think about it for a second.
And you tell me, and I don't care if you
are a conservative, Republican, a
progressive, an independent, moderate,
whatever you are. You tell me, do you
think it is appropriate in this, the
longest standing democracy on earth,
that one man, Mr. Musk could donate
$270 million to elect Trump as
president and then get rewarded by
getting the most important and powerful
position in government.
But I have to tell you, I have to tell
you, it's not just Musk and
Republicans. That corruption exists in
the Democratic party as
well.
Billionaires in the Democratic side make
huge contributions. And there is a
reason why for too many years and for
too many candidates, Democrats have not
had the guts to take on powerful special
interests.
I want
to say something else and that is Yeah,
I want to say a lot of things actually.
Um, you know, I am I am not somebody who
is, you know, I am proud to be Jewish,
but I'm not into organized religion very
much. But, but but
but I do believe in moral values.
Believe in that a
lot. And I do believe, you know,
Christ's sermon on the mount. What did
he say? He said, "Do unto
others as you would have them do unto
you." And it turns out that that
principle, do unto others as you would
have them do unto you, exists in
virtually every religion on earth.
Exists in Judaism. It exists in Islam.
It exists in every religion. Treat
people in the way that you would want
them to treat you. Be decent to other
people. Be kind to other people so they
will be kind to you.
And I know that in
Utah and in Vermont and all over the
country, there are millions, tens of
millions of people who believe that, who
try to do the right thing, try to be
decent, try to be humble, try to respect
the rights of other people, try not to
be bullies. Millions and millions of
people hold that ethos very, very
strongly. But I do want to say that in
terms of the oligarchs in this country,
they are also very religious people. But
they have a strange
religion. Their religion is greed,
greed, and more greed.
All over this country, we have a very
serious problem in Vermont and all over
this country about addiction, right?
People addicted to drugs. People are
drinking too
much. All types of
addiction. These people, the
oligarchs, are addicted to greed. Our
job is to help them break that
addiction. We cannot continue to live in
a country where billionaires will step
on people, take food away from hungry
children in order to give tax breaks to
people who don't need it.
I happen to
believe that we are more human. We live
more fulfilled lives when we try to help
other people, not step on other
people. But brothers and sisters, we're
not just fighting oligarchy. We're
fighting a president who undermines our
Constitution every
day, who threatens our freedom of speech
and assembly, and whose agents are
rounding up innocent people off the
streets, throwing them into unmarked
vans, and bringing them to detention
centers in this country and
abroad. That is what takes place in
dictatorships, not in America. We will
not allow them to continue to do that.
the founding. You know, I find
myself trying to remember my history
lessons. Should have done better in
history. But I think back to the
founding of this country. And let me
tell you, the founding fathers of this
country were no
dummies. They remember the history.
We're talking about the 1780s. They had
just fought a war, an impossibly
difficult war, where they defeated the
king of England, the most powerful
person on the planet.
Let's hear it for George Washington.
But anyhow, these guys had taken on an
autocrat and they sat and they sit
around and they said, "All right, what
do we want in our new country? What do
we want?" And what they said is, "We
don't want any one person to have all of
that power." So they dealt, you know,
they dealt with the federalist papers
and all that stuff and they came up with
this kind of brilliant idea of a
separation of powers. All right. They
said we're going to have a legislative
branch, Congress, House and Senate. We
are going to have a executive branch,
the president. We're going to have a
judiciary, the federal courts. And each
one will have check on each other. And
what I want to tell you, and I don't
need to tell you, I think you're seeing
it every single day. You have a
president who is working overtime to
take power away from the Congress. You
got a
president who is working
overtime to take power away from the
federal courts.
Now it is unprecedented. You know, no
president, no member of Congress wants
to see a Supreme Court or any court rule
against him or her. We don't like to see
that. I will tell you that we have seen
in the last 20 years with the Roberts
court horrendous decisions on Citizens
United and Row versus Wade. Terrible
decisions.
But we understand that we live in a rule
of
law. What Trump and his friends are
doing now is they're saying, "Oh, a
judge ruled against us. A judge said we
can't do something which is
unconstitutional. Let us get rid of that
judge. Let us impeach that judge."
So in other words, you take power away
from Congress, you take power away from
the judiciary and also you got a
president who really does not like to be
criticized. So he is sued. I mean this
is again unprecedented.
He has sued
ABC,
CBS, Meta, the De Moines Register. The
De Mo Register did a poll he didn't
like. They are suing
him. They are
investigating right now PBS and
NPR. until you add it all
together. And what I would say to Trump,
if you cannot take criticism, get out of
the political
process. This is the democracy and
criticism is an essential part of that
democracy.
And I'll tell you something that again,
this is scary stuff. What Trump has done
is gone after major law firms. You're
familiar with this. He's gone after
major law firms who had opposed them in
the past, opposed him or his friends.
And what is really
disgraceful is that a number of these
law firms whose job it is to defend the
rule of law, they have caved in to Trump
in order to get their millions and
millions of dollars in government
contracts. And he's going after
universities.
The function of a higher university when
education in general is the pursuit of
truth wherever that takes us.
And we are now seeing really sadly major
universities changing their
curriculum in order to appease Trump and
hang on to their federal
grants. Founding fathers of our country
waged a war for democracy. We believe in
democracy. We are not going to let Trump
take us into an authoritarian
society. But it is not just domestic
policy that we should be concerned
about. For the first time in our
250 year history, we have a president
who is aligning us with a terrible
dictatorship in
Russia. No, Mr. President, Ukraine did
not start that war. Putin and Russia
did.
And we're not going to sell out the
people of Ukraine for Trump to make some
partnership with
Putin. But it's not just Ukraine. Not
just Ukraine. I very strongly opposed
the Biden administration when they
provided billions of dollars to the
extremist Netanyahu government.
Israel, Israel, like any country, has a
right to defend itself against
terrorism,
but
but it does not have the right to wage
an allout war against the Palestinian
people in Gaza.
This is a war. This is a war that has
already killed in an area of 2.2 million
people. has killed 50,000 people, has
injured has injured over
110,000 60% of whom are women, children,
and the elderly.
And to make a bad situation even uglier,
Trump has now decided that he wants the
United States to dispel, to get rid of
all of the people in Gaza so he can
build a Riviera for his billionaire
friends.
That is beyond insane. And we're not
going to allow that to happen.
Let's take a moment to do something that
is not often done in the media, in the
corporate media or in the halls of
Congress, and that is to tell the truth
about what goes on in America
today. And here it is in a nutshell.
On one hand, you have the people on top
who have never ever had it so good in
the history of
America. Mr. Bezos, Mr. Musk himself,
listen to this. One man owns five times
more wealth than the bottom 50% of
American households.
He is worth 340 billion while the bottom
50% of households are worth $63
billion. The top 1% in America now owns
more wealth than the bottom 90%.
and CEOs of major corporations now earn
300 times what their workers make.
Now that is one America and it's an
America where these guys really are
separated from the reality of American
life. They fly around in their own jets.
They own their own islands. They send
their kids to exclusive schools. They
have nannies. They live in their very
separate world. That's one world. And
then there is another world. And in that
other world, in the richest country in
the history of the world, 60% of our
people live paycheck to
paycheck. Does everybody here know what
living paycheck to paycheck is about?
Are some of you living paycheck to
paycheck?
Well, I know a little bit about it
because I grew up in a
family that lived paycheck to paycheck
and grew up in a rent controlled
apartment. And let me tell you what
living paycheck to paycheck is about. It
is wondering what happens when your
landlord raises your rent.
It is wondering what happens when your
kid gets sick and you can't take her to
a doctor. It is wondering what happens
to you when you can't afford the
outrageous cost of prescription
drugs. It is wondering what
happens what happens to you if your car
breaks down. Think about this. If your
car breaks down and the mechanic says
it's a thousand bucks to fix the car,
you don't have a th000 bucks. What What
do you do if you don't have that
thousand bucks? You can lose your job.
You lose your job, your whole life is
shattered.
That's living paycheck to paycheck. And
you know what the reality of all of that
is? And I want you to hear this. As a
nation, despite spending so much on
healthcare, we live about four years
shorter lives than the people in other
countries. But here's something that is
very rarely discussed. If you are
working class in America, you will live
seven a sevenyear shorter life on
average than the rich.
Why is that?
primarily stress.
It's trying to figure out every single
day,
365 days a year, how you going to
survive, how you going to pay the bills,
how you going to take care of the basic
necessities of life. And you do that day
after day, week after week, year after
year. It takes years from your life.
So you got an America an economy today
people on top never had it so
good workingass
people 60% of whom living paycheck to
paycheck hundreds and hundreds of
thousand people living working on for
starvation wages in America today the
richest country in the history of the
world we have the highest rate of
childhood
poverty of almost any major nation. In
America, the wealthiest nation on earth,
$22% of seniors are trying to get by on
$15,000 a year or
less. Half of older workers have nothing
in the bank as they face retirement.
Now, way back when, I'm a little bit
older than most of
you. I had the honor of being in
Washington, DC in
1963 to hear Dr. Martin Luther King
Jr. And I was there, not up here, but
way way way in the back. huge
crowd talking hearing him speak about
racism in America and the need to end
racism. And the good news is that over
the last number of years we have made
progress. Not enough, but we have made
significant progress in ending racism in
America. Not so many years ago, there
were two women in the United States
Senate. Today there are well over 20 and
there
are there were no women governors. Today
there are many. Back then hundreds of
women died every year because they could
not access a legal
abortion. We have made some progress but
that struggle still continues. Women
have the right to control their own
bodies, not the government.
And I
can I can remember as a kid that anybody
who was gay, they never talked about it.
They never made that public. They
suffered in silence. And the idea then,
oh, we need a medic here.
Can we get please get somebody here?
Water for all.
Okay. All right. I think she's she Okay.
Okay. Good. Thank you all.
What I
was saying is it wasn't so many years
ago, so many decades ago where people
who were gay had to keep it to
themselves and they suffered in their
silence and the dream, the idea of gay
marriage was something almost
inconceivable. All right. My point in
saying these things is that over the
decades we have made progress in a
number of important areas. We've made
progress in combating racism, made
progress in combating sexism, made
progress in combating
homophobia, but there is one
area where not only have we not made
progress, but we have lost lost ground
and that is the economic struggle facing
tens of millions of working families in
this
country. Back in
1944 in a state of the union address,
President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, one
of our very greatest
presidents, he said something very
profound and in so many words, what he
said is, you know, we have a
constitution. It's a great constitution
guarantees freedom of speech, freedom of
religion, etc.
But what we need to do is incorporate it
into our values the understanding that
economic rights are human rights.
We are the richest country on earth and
new technologies are going to make us
even richer. There is no excuse for
children in America going
hungry. There is no excuse for elderly
people not being able to afford their
prescription drugs.
There is no excuse for 800,000 people
sleeping out on the
streets. Now, what the establishment
does and that is the media and all of
the corporate world, they want to tell
you that you're not entitled to
anything.
that life is a struggle, that it's doggy
dog, and if you were born poor or
working class, tough luck.
Well, I have a different vision for
America and that
is we have got to end this corrupt
campaign finance system, overturn
Citizens United.
and move to public funding of elections.
Elon Musk should not be funding our
elections. We have got to deal with the
grotesque level of income and wealth
inequality. We're not going to give tax
breaks to billionaires. We're going to
demand they start paying their fair
share of
taxes. We're not going to tolerate tens
of millions of workers trying to get by
on starvation wages. We're going to
raise the federal minimum wage to a
living
wage. All over this country, workers
want to join
unions. Cuz you when you're in a union,
you get better wages, better benefits,
better working conditions.
We're going to pass legislation that
stops corporations from acting illegally
against workers who want to join
unions. A lot of people in Washington
are talking about cutting social
security. We're not going to cut Social
Security. We're going to expand Social
Security.
Now, some of the young people here may
not know it, but not so many years ago,
if you had a job, you would often have
what's called a
defined pension benefit. In other words,
you worked and part of the benefits were
that when you retired, you knew you got
a check every month for a certain
amount. We got to bring back defined
pension benefits.
And when we talk about where we want to
go as an country, I want everybody here
to
understand we are the only major country
on earth that does not guarantee
healthcare to all people as a human
right.
This is not a radical
idea. We are spending twice as much per
capita on health care as the people of
other nations. And yet 85 million and
many of you here are uninsured or
underinsured. Large deductibles. Yes.
The function of a rational health care
system is not to make huge profits for
the insurance companies and the drug
companies. We need a Medicare for all
singlepayer program.
All over this country in Vermont and all
over this country, we've got a major
housing
crisis. It's not just that 800,000 are
homeless, 20 million Americans are
spending 50% of their limited incomes on
housing. That's crazy.
Instead of spending a trillion dollars a
year on the military, let's build 5
million units of low-income and
affordable
housing. We live in a competitive global
economy. We need the best educated
workforce on Earth.
It is beyond absurd that young people
who want to get a higher education or go
to trade school have to go deeply in
debt in order to do
that. Anybody here dealing with student
debt? Okay, just think about it. We
need, we desperately need more doctors,
more nurses, more psychologists, more
dentists, more construction workers,
more plumbers, more
electricians. We desperately need them.
People should not have to go into debt
to do the work that America desperately
needs.
It is not a radical idea. It is not. You
know, a hundred years ago, working class
people said, you know what? We want our
kids not to be working in factories or
in the fields. We demand public
education and we got
that. But that stops at the 12th grade.
The world has changed. We got to make
public colleges and universities
tuitionfree. We want the best educated
population on
earth. From child care to public schools
to higher education, that's what we
should be doing. Now, Donald Trump in
his
genius thinks that climate change is a
hoax. We know it is an existential
threat and we know we can create
millions of goodaying jobs transforming
our energy system away from fossil fuel
to energy efficiency and sustainable
energy. All
right. My point in going through all of
those, and there's a lot more we could
discuss, but my point in going through
those things, is to tell you
that economic rights, the right of all
of our people, our men, women, and
children, our older people, our sick
people to live in security and dignity
is not a radical idea.
back in
1857. Frederick Douglas, you all
remember Frederick
Douglas, a great abolitionist. And in
1857, they were in the middle obviously
of this great struggle to end slavery.
And I want you to hear what he said
because what he said back in
1857 in the fight against slavery is as
relevant today as it was then. This is
what he said. Listen carefully.
Power conceds nothing without a demand.
It never did and it never will.
Find out just what any people will
quietly submit to. And you have found
out the exact measure of injustice and
wrong which will be imposed upon
them. And these will continue till they
are resisted with either words or blows
or with both. The limits of tyrants are
prescribed by the endurance of those
whom they
oppress. Pretty relevant today, isn't
it? In other words, all that Douglas is
saying, they ain't going to give you
nothing. They want it all. And unless we
stand up together and tell them sorry
this country believe belongs to all of
us not just the billionaire class.
Unless we bring our people together we
will never achieve the
goals that we
want. Now, I am not an I'm not a
mathematician, but I do know that 99% is
a hell of a larger number than 1%.
So if we stand together and not let them
divide us up by the color of our skin or
where we were born or our sexual
orientation, if we stand together, we
can defeat Trumpism. We can defeat
authoritarianism. We can defeat
oligarchy. We can create a new nation.
Thank you all very much.
Power to the
people. Power to the
people. Power to the
people. Power to the people.
