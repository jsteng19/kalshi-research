W thank you
Arizona this is an unbelievable turn up I think we got many thousands of people
outside and I'm especially delighted to be here tonight
with
Alexandria you when I Alexandria was a little girl she helped her mom clean
homes to make the money the family needed and she is one of the members of
Congress who has not forgotten where she came
from Alexandria and I were in Las Vegas us earlier today tomorrow we'll be in
Colorado and then we're coming back the
Tucson because we have a message for Mr
Trump and that is we will not allow you to move this
country into an
oligarchy we're not going to allow you and your friend Mr mus and the other
billionaires to wreck havoc on the Working Families of this
country no you're not going to destroy Social Security you're not going to destroy
Medicaid you're not going to destroy the Veterans
Administration and I'll tell you what else you're not going to do we're not going to let you undermine the Democracy
that men and women in this country have fought and died
for and every day every single day Trump and his
friends are ignoring the Constitution of the United States of
[Applause] America you know when we were kids in
elementary school we read about American history and about how this government
our government was formed and the Constitution was written I got news you those guys way back in the
1790s were nobody's fools they
understood that in our Constitution and in our government you have to have a
separation of power so that no one person had it
all and they created an executive branch a legislator branch and a Judiciary and
every day Trump is trying to take power away from the
Congress he is trying to take power away from the
Judiciary unbelievably when a court makes a
decision you can agree with it you can disagree with it most of us thought that
citizens united decision was a horrible decision
most of us thought that the decision to override Ro v Wade was a terrible
decision but in our form of government you don't impeach judges for writing a
decision you disagree
with in our form of government unless you are a coward you don't sue the media
because they report on things you don't
like you don't sue the de Mo register because they get a poll whose results
you don't
like in the Democratic Society we understand that criticism and debate is
what makes this country great and unless you are a coward like
Trump is you welcome that debate and that
discussion but it's not just oligarchy that we are going to fight it's not just
authoritarianism that we're going to fight we will not accept a society today in which we have
massive income and wealth inequalities where the very rich have never done
better while working families are struggling to put food on the
table and we're not you know I know we're in a hockey rank and you got guys playing the
defense but they also play offense and our offense is to remind us
all and every person in this country we are the wealthiest nation in the history
of this world and that we want and will have an
economy and a government that works for all of us not just the 1%
now I want to do something radical you ready for something [Music]
radical I want to discuss some things that you don't hear in Congress and you don't see in the corporate media in fact
what I want to do is tell the
truth so what don't we talk about in America that what does Trump avoid will
never mention in a million years and that is that in America today Trump and
his billionaire friends have never ever had it so good in the history of this
[Applause] country in America today we have more
income and wealth inequality than we have ever ever had
you got three people Mr musk Mr Bezos Mr Zuckerberg who
combin you know those guys those three people combin their
wealth is greater than the bottom half of American society
170 million people
the top 1% now owns more wealth than the bottom
90% CEOs now make 300 times more than their
average worker that is not what America is
supposed to be about and together we're going to change that
but it's not that's right USA the greatest country on Earth and
we're not going to allow Trump to destroy our great
country but it is not just income and wealth inequality what we are seeing today is
more concentration of ownership than we have ever had
while the profits on Wall Street in Corporate America saw a handful of giant
corporations dominate sector after sector after sector whether it's
agriculture Transportation media Financial Services you know what you got
you got a few corporations dominating that sector making huge profits and
charging us outrageous prices for the products we need [Applause]
let me give you unbelievably this is really quite unbelievable three Wall
Street firms Black Rock Vanguard and St
[Applause] Street these three firms
combined are the major stockholders in 95% of American corporations
[Applause] that is what power is about you know you go out you think this is a corporation
not it's owned by somebody else over the last couple of years my orcus has been involved in supporting unions who are on
strike around the
country so we get on the phone I say I want to talk to the CEO because I'm
concerned about the way you're treating your workers and they say well the CEO doesn't have any power got to talk to
the other guy who owns the company talk to the other got to talk to somebody else who owns them so what you have is
massive power massive concentration of ownership and let me tell you something
about these guys CU I I deal with them
occasionally they are not nice
guys you know if somebody goes out and Robs a 911 you got 911s here all right
somebody goes out and Robs a local store everybody
says you know that's a criminal God forbid somebody gets shot terrible put
the person in jail and so forth but you know who the biggest criminals are in
this country they are the CEOs of major
corporations who are robbing us every single day
they are the fossil fuel industry that has lied to us for
years about what they're doing to the planet it is the drug companies who
charge us the highest prices in the world and people die because they can't afford those
drugs it's the insurance companies who deny claim after claim
those are major criminals but these people these people
on top they are completely removed from American society do you think they've
ever been in a Subway in their life do you think they send their kids to Public
Schools do you think they worry about the cost of Health Care and whether they
can get to a doctor you think they vacation in a national
park well these guys vacation in the islands in which they
[Music] own and some of them Just For Kicks Will
spend a few million dollars riding on a spaceship to out
space so that is one America it's in America where the
1% has never had it to go and I want to say something I fully don't understand
and maybe you can help me on this everybody wants to live comfortably everybody wants to make money but what I
have never understood is why it is that when you have people who are worth tens
of billions of dollars they have this compulsion this greed that they need
more and more and more and they are prepared to step on anybody who gets in
their way can you imagine people like musk and
other multibillion as cutting nutrition programs for Hungry
children in what world in what planet in what religion is that vaguely
[Applause] moral so you got one America in which
the people on top top have enormous wealth and they have enormous power and
I'll tell you something else about power power is not just owning a couple of mansions and a Jet Plane what power is
when election comes it's the ability to spend unlimited amounts of money to buy
and sell
politicians and I don't care if you're a republican Democrat or independent does
anybody think that people like mus spending
$270 million to elect Trump as president and then becoming the most important
person in government does anybody think that has anything to do with a democratic FL of a
[Applause] society but it is not just us and it is
not just Republicans Democrats have their billionaire campaign contribution
as well and that is why in my view this probably nothing more important that we
can do than overturn this disastrous citizens united
to let me tell you how bad it is I tell you how bad it is if any Republican
wants to vote their conscience and if any Republican in the house or the Senate says you know maybe is not a good
idea to give a trillion dollars in tax breaks to the 1% and then cut Medicaid
and education and nutrition if that person would to stand up and say I have a problem with that you know what musk
would do musk in five minutes would say we are going to primary you your political life is
over that is not democracy and our fight is to make sure
that we remain a democracy one person one vote not billionaires by
ele so today we have the 1% billionaires
doing better than they have ever done before that's one America let me tell you about the other America but you know
as much about that America as I do and that is that today in the richest
country in the history of the world 60% of our people are living paycheck to
paycheck you all know what paycheck to paycheck is about all I grew up in a family
Alexandria grew up in a family that Liv paycheck the paycheck and un like Donald Trump I know
something about that reality and it is a reality that got me
into politics and it's a reality that I will never
forget so what does living paycheck to paycheck mean it means that every day
every day millions of Americans worry about how they're going to pay their
rents or their mortgage tomorrow your landlord tells you that he's raising your rent 20 30%
what the hell are you supposed to do you got a kid you can't afford the
rent you got to find another place to live you got to take your kid out of school all over this country rents are
soaring we have not only 800,000 Americans who sleep out on the
street for 20 million Americans and I suspect many in this room who are paying 40 50%
of their limited incomes for
housing that's living paycheck to paycheck living paycheck to paycheck is
being a single mom and having to figure out how you come up with $20,000 a year
for child care so that you go to work support your
kids Liv paycheck to paycheck is wanting to buy good quality
food for your kids but going to the grocery store and seeing the prices are
Sky High P living paycheck the paycheck is
getting sick pay and wondering whether or not
not you can afford to go to the doctor wondering whether or not you can take
your kids to the doctor that's living paycheck to
paycheck living paycheck to paycheck is not having the money to pay off your
credit card debt and month after month paying 20 30% interest rates on that
credit [Applause] card are you tell me now what did I miss
what is living paycheck to paycheck about say that
again she got paid yesterday she's got no money today you paid off your bills
all right what else let me paycheck to raise your hand yes
ma' all right afraid that if you protest you might get arrested and you won't be
able to get a job yes sir
what right now paying for education you know you might you might think you might
think that in a competitive global economy we want to make sure that our
kids have the best possible education without going deeply into de
and yet all over the country we have young people are wondering whether or not they can go to a trade school to
become an electrician or Carpenter whether they go to college want to become a teacher but they're worried
about coming out of school 50 $100,000 today do you know we are in desperate
need of doctors in this country if you are a working class person come from
working class family you go to medical school do you know what kind of debt you end up with anyone know half a million
dollar half a million dollar debt to score three $400,000 a debt that is
totally insane we want people to be doctors and nurses and Mental Health Counselors and
teachers we don't want to go we going to have them go with financial servitude in
order to do the jobs we desperately
need you know but it is not just working age people who are
struggling paycheck to paycheck or struggling economically it's not widely known but today again in the richest
country on Earth 22% of senior citizens are trying to
survive on $115,000 a year or less
[Applause] how disgraceful is it the country the
people who raised us trying to live on 15,000 bucks or less in this rich
country where Trump and his friends want to get more tax breaks to billionaires
we have the highest CH rate of childhood Poverty of country on
Earth but it's not just in and wealth inequality not just
concentration in this society today in America everybody knows
that we have a Health Care system that is broken that is dysfunctional that is
cruel not widely known we don't talk about it I guess the medeia and
politicians are not particularly proud of it but some 60,000 Americans die
every year because they don't get to a doctor on time because they can't afford
healthare we got 85 million people who are uninsured or
underinsured how many people right here in this Arena have high deductibles what kind of deductibles do
you have ma'am what are you do 5,000 what do you [Applause]
got how one at a time s 7,000 deductible
other deductibles yeah 12,000
8,000 8,000 how much
6 5,000 all what the story is you can be
insured and you count as somebody who's insured but you can't afford to go to the doctor cuz you got to hi
deduc that is
insane it's not just health I want to raise another issue that has never ever
or very rarely talked about I was chairman of a committee we did some work
on this but it's an issue that needs a whole lot of discussion many of you may
know let me take a deep breath what do we want out of life let me ask
you a philosophical question what we want out of life is to live I think I
think people can correct me if i w here you want to live long lives right you want to live a long life you want to
live a happy life we want to live a productive life we want to do meaningful
work right right that's what we want in America today despite spending twice as
much per capita on Healthcare as the people of any other Nation our life
expectancy how long we live is 4 years shorter than other countries on average
got that and why that is it's a long discussion can't get into it tonight
but but here's what I do want to say as bad as that is there is something that
is even worse and we don't ever talk about and that is if you are a working
class person in America you will live on average 7 to 8 years shorter lives than
the wealthy you got that in other words
being working class in America is a death sentence all right I got a question I
want to ask you and I want you to give me your best answer why is it that a working class person will die seven or
eight years earlier than somebody who's rich hold on hold can't hold one at a time raise your hand
man access to healthcare is one issue it's not the only one yes
sir gentleman here said
stress all right who wants to tell me about stress all right raise your hand and be
as loud as you can yes sir right here be loud over too much overtime overworked
and he needs too much overtime to to take care of the family overwork yes sir
supporting disabled par Sal supporting two disabled parents on a teacher's
salary exr yes sir where where's your body out
yeah AF that well that's right that's worrying about being deported okay yes
ma'am my KS to with all these yeah still paying off student
loans and can't afford to retire man right here
[Music]
did everybody hear that what she said is making a
choice between getting the medicine you need to stay alive or feeding your
family now if that's not stress if that's not a decision that no one in America should have to make I don't know
what is all see yes
yes be loud every amans their
[Music]
and right I I think we can probably go on
for many hours but here's the point and we don't talk about it I want to back up again I
want to say this I would say it over and over but I would eventually bore you to death if we were look if we were a poor
country I would come before you and i' say I'm sorry that you got to work 50 hours a week I'm sorry that you really
have to do dangerous and dirty work I'm sorry that you can't afford to send your kid to college I'm sorry that the
elementary school your kid goes to is inadequate whether that you can't afford char but we're a poor country we just
can't afford that we are not a poor
country there is no excuse in God's Earth that people have to make a choice
between food and the medicine they need to stay alive
but what we have got to do you see this is you know what the system in the broad
usance what the establishment what the media what the politicians want you to
believe is a you are powerless you can't do anything they got all the money they
got all the power and be that what you believe you're just a small number of
people the truth is that the overwhelming majority of people
Democrats Republicans Independence understand that everybody in this country has the right to a
decent comfortable standard of [Applause]
living you know way back way back in the
1940s people like President Roosevelt were talking about economic rights as
human rights so under our constitution right
you have freedom of speech freedom of religion freedom of congregation freedom of all kinds of freedoms what we have
got to establish in this country is that economic rights are human rights
everybody is entitled to a decent stand everybody is entitled to healthare
to educ ition to affordable
housing and brothers and sisters this is not a radical idea it exists already in
other countries we are the only major country not to guarantee Health Care to all
people go to Europe kids go to college you know much College cost in
gery zero you know the child care course is
in [Music] Scandinavia we can do
it one of the important things when we talk about the list of things that we
have to do making sure that we have a minimum wage in this country that it's
not a starvation wage but a livable wage
17 bucks an hour making sure that workers who want
to joyan unions all over this [Music] country we got a union brothers and
sisters here all right thank
you unions helped create the middle class in this country and we thank you
and all over this country working people want to join unions and you know what's
happening people like basos and musk and other
billionaires are acting illegally against the law making it impossible or
difficult for workers to form a union that's why we got to pass legislation
that I recently introduced called the proa puning that
are you know it's an amazing thing I it's an embarrassing thing and it really
is quite extraordinary every bloody scientist in the world who has studied the climate
issue understands that climate change is
real nothing to be Happ about it's real and it is caused by carbon
emissions and human activity what is it we need a doctor we
need all right please got somebody there good
okay let's wait a second for Trump is
not [Applause]
[Music] Trum thank
you what is extraordinarily
embarrassing is that while the entire scientific Community understands that climate change is real it is caused by
human activity and carbon emissions we have a president today who believes that
climate change is a hoax originating in [Applause]
China well he may think it's a hoax we think it's an existential threat to the
planet and I want to thank Alexandria the world
legislation three jobs we can create millions of good paid
jobs Transforming Our Energy System away from fossil fuel Energy Efficiency and
sustainability
you know musk and his friends are busy going to war against Working
Families and federal employees and I want to say
[Music] something okay
U and I want you to think about this for a moment take a deep breath and think about this right now they're in the
process they want to lay off 83,00 th000 employees at the Veterans
Administration unbelievable I mean these are the people who put their lives on the line to defend us and you got Trump
and musk wanting to significantly lower the quality of Health Care and other
benefits that they [Applause] receive and they're going after Social
Security some of you may have heard Trump talking about all of these millions of people 200 years of age
getting Social Security it's a lie I know you will be shocked to hear
that he lied on what their goal is in doing that in fact well over 99% including
according to the Inspector General at Social Security well over 99% of the benefits going out to people are going
to people who earn those benefits
and you know why they are lying about social security they want to destroy they want
to have the American people lose confidence in Social Security and lose
confidence that our government can work for them and what these people really
believe they don't some of them people on top do not believe in the the concept
of government you know back in the 19th century the ruling class the Kings and
the monarchs propagated the Divine rights of Kings you remember that they
were authorized by God to rule well let me tell you something some
of these guys these big billionaire tcrs think they have the right divine right
to rule us as [Applause] well so we got some news for them we
ain't going to be ruled by them we believe in
democracy let me mention something else think about it for a minute we are
in the throws of a major technological Revolution through artificial
intelligence and Robotics now I want you to think about this for a second if musk
and his friends could summarily get rid of hundreds of thousands of federal
employees and by the way do it illegally okay what do you think they
are going to do in the private sector when artificial intelligence
comes what they're going to say hey we got a machine we got a computer that could do your job thank you you're out
on the street and by the way we cut back on Medicaid Social Security and
Medicare so this is an issue we've got to watch technology in my
view can be a very positive development if it is used to benefit Ordinary People
not just the CEOs
one of the pieces of legislation I introduced last year we'll introduce it again is I said you know what if you
have all of this new technology that is making working people more
productive why don't we reduce the work week to 32 hours with no loss of
day not a radical idea taking place around the country but here's the point
you got this powerful Technology robotics artificial intelligence they're going to make the economy much more
productive we cannot allow the billionaire class alone to benefit from those changes in
Te so we are going to fight Trump and his oligarchic
friends we're going to take on their effort to move us to an
authoritarian Society but we have got to do something else we have got to
ourselves have a vision for the kind of country we want to
become and if we are going as I mentioned a moment ago restore a vibrant
democracy in this country we got to get rid of citizens united and billionaires
buying
elections we have got to move to Public Funding of
Elections one person one vote not Billy ass buying and selling politicians
Trump and his friends want to give a trillion dollars in tax breaks to the 1%
we've got a slightly different idea maybe they should start paying their fair share
of musk and Trump want to cut Social Security we ain't going to let it in
fact instead of cutting Social Security we should expand social SEC benefits by
lifting the cap on
tax Trump and his friends want to cut vade by $880
billion millions of kids will lose their health insurance community health centers will
lose an important part of their funding if you got a mom or a dad in a nursing home understand that two out of three
people in nursing homes are funded by Medicaid it would be a disaster for the Whole Health Care System well we got a
different idea instead of cutting Medicaid we're going to guarantee Health Care to every
man woman and
child instead of allowing Wall Street to buy up homes All Over America and raise
rents we we got a slightly different idea we're going to build 4 million units of low income at affordable
housing some may not understand it but if we're going to make America great you
got to have the best educated Workforce in the
world no teacher no public school teacher in America should make less than
$60,000 a year there is no rational reason why we
cannot have cannot have the best educational system best child care
system in the entire world no reason why every young person
cannot be able to go to college or trade school regardless of his or her income
now Trump and some of my Republican colleagues talk a lot about Freedom well
in a free Society we must absolutely guarantee that it is the women of
America who control their bodies not the government
I want to remind you in these difficult times that real change real
change always comes from the bottom on up not the top on that
it was Grassroots activism that helped women have the
right to control their own buddies it
was Grassroots activism that allowed workers in the
early part of the 20th century to form unions
not forget the bosses of that time that eye workers any rights hired
and fired them work them any way they wanted workers stood up and some of them got beaten up some of them got killed
but they stood and they fought and they created the Trade union
movement was mon Lu King Jr and Grassroots activism that ended
segregation in
it was PR through activism that created the environmental movement and the gay
rights
movement so I say to you tonight yes the oligarchs are enormously powerful that's
just the truth they have an unlimited amount of money they control our economy
they own much of the media and they have enormous influence over our political
system but from the bottom of my heart I
am convinced that they can be defeated
if we stand together if we stand together this is what demog gods always
do look they understand you go out to working class Republicans and you say hey guys do you really think we should
give tax breaks to billionaires and cut Social Security and Medicaid they say
well you're crazy of course not nobody believes that nobody or very few people
believe that climate change is not real very few people think that we should not
expand medicad C dental hearing Vision right people are in agreement about this
is so how do these these right-wing Republicans succeed they succeed a
that's true don't have the time to get but it's we have never seen the big lie I will
not here to tell you that politicians Never Lie they do but not to the level that we have seen from
Trump we're talking about really big outrageous lies you
[Music] know so point is that their job the way
they succeed to give tax breaks to the rich throw people off of Health Care try to cut Social Security is they divide us
up that's how they do they want you to hate her and her to hate him and you to
hate that person over there that's how they do that's how demard always do it
you pick on a scapegoat and you ask the person who's all the problems you have
you got to hate that person and we know better we
know that if we stand together and we don't let them divide us up by the color
of our skin where we were born our religion our sexual
orientation if we stand together we can not only defeat
trumpism but we can create the kind of great nation we know that we can become
thank you all very much [Applause]
[Music] [Applause] [Music]
thank you
[Applause] [Music]
