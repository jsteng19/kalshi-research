Thank you, Missoula.
Let me
begin by sharing a very fond memory with
you about Missoula.
I was here, I expect, right in this
auditorium a number of years ago
because my daughter Karina thought that
Vermont was not rural
enough. So, she wanted to go to a real
rural
state and she decided to come here to
the University of Montana.
And while she was
here, she met a boyfriend named
Blake. They got
married. And today I am the grandfather
of two beautiful kids, Cole and Tessy.
So, so thank you University of Montana
for bringing them
together. And let me thank all of the
speakers who have preceded me. Uh, a
special thanks to Sarah Nelson, one of
the great trade union leaders in
America. And a very very special thanks
to Alexandria
Kaziocortez who is not only a great
congresswoman from New York but has been
an inspiration to millions of young
people throughout the country.
I want to say a word about Alexandria
which has less to do with her than to do
with you. And that is that I think six
years ago or
so, Alexandria was a waitress in New
York City. That's what she did. She was
waitress and she looked around her in a
community which has very serious
problems and she said, "You know what?
We can do better." And she decided with
no money, with no
organization, but with just a spirit to
fight for justice. She organized and she
took on one of the most powerful people
in the US Congress and she defeated him.
Now why I say this is not just about
Alexandria, it is about you. because I
suspect that in this room of seven or 8
thousand people and the couple of
thousand people outside who couldn't get
in, we have a lot of
Alexandrias and Josephs and Harry's and
Mary's. And what we are asking you today
is to understand that coming to this
rally is just the first step in moving
forward to transforming this country.
Donald Trump has taken us into an
unprecedented moment in modern American
history. And we have got to respond in
an unprecedented way.
And that means you can't look around and
say, "Well, Alexandria is going to do
it. Bernie's going to do it. Somebody
else is going to do it. Ain't going to
happen. You are going to have to do it."
Now, brothers and sisters, Alexandria
and I have been all over the country,
and we've seen record-breaking
turnouts.
Unbelievable. Including right here in
Missoula. And I believe that people and
it's not just Democrats and it's not
just independents. We got Republicans
coming out as well
because they are saying loudly and
clearly, we will not allow the United
States of America to become an
oligarchy.
In America
today, one person, I want you to hear
this clearly, one person, you may have
heard of him, his name is Elon Musk.
Mr. Musk
himself owns more wealth than the bottom
56% of American
households. One person owns more wealth
than 56% of American households. That is
not what this country is supposed to be
about. But it is not just
oligarchy. The American people,
conservative, progressive, moderate, are
standing up loud and clear and telling
Trump, "You will not create an
authoritarian society. We're a
democracy.
together, brothers and sisters. And it's
hard. I'm not going to hit sit here and
give you some fancy rhetoric. Taking on
oligarchy is enormously difficult. These
guys own the economy. We now have more
concentration of ownership than we've
ever had in the history of this country.
They own most of the media. They own the
United States Congress and the White
House. They got enormous amounts of
wealth and power. But you know what we
got? We got the people.
And the last that I have
heard is that
99% is a hell of a bigger number than
1%.
So when we stand
together and
overcome what Trump and his friends try
to do, and that is to divide us up by
the color of our skin or where we were
born, whether we're born in the United
States or someplace else or our religion
or our sexual orientation, whatever it
may be, that is what demagogues always
do. They always find some minority and
they say to the whole country, you got
all kinds of problems. That's who it is.
It's the immigrants. It's transgender
people. It's gay
people. That's how they win. They divide
us up. But when we stand
together, black and white and gay and
straight,
There is
nothing that can stop us.
And right
now in the United States
Congress, they are working along with
Trump on what is called a reconciliation
bill.
See, it is not good enough for them that
Musk owns more wealth than the bottom
56% of households. Not good enough for
them that the top 1% owns more wealth
than the bottom 90%. Not good enough.
Not good enough that CEOs of large
corporations now make 300 times what
their workers make. Not good enough.
So now they're working on
legislation that would provide
1.1 trillion dollars in tax breaks to
the 1%.
And they do that by cutting Medicaid by
880 billion.
They do that by cutting nutrition
programs for hungry children.
They do that by cutting education and
other programs that working families
desperately
need. Now, you have a congressman here.
His name is Ryan Zinci.
Now, I come from Vermont, traveled a
long distance to get here. Alexandria
comes from New York, traveled a long
distance. Mr. Zinci does not have to
travel a long distance to meet with you.
So I would suggest that you ask him to
sit down, have a meeting with a few
thousand
people and ask him one simple question.
Mr. Ziki, are you going to vote to cut
Medicaid and education and nutrition to
give massive tax breaks to billionaires
who don't need it?
So, Mr. Ziki, have the courtesy to do
what we do in a democracy. Sit down and
have a little chat with your
constituents.
And right now, it's not only tax breaks
for the rich and cuts to Medicaid.
Unbelievably, you have Mr. Musk,
wealthiest guy on earth, running all
over Washington DC. He is cutting the
staff at the Social Security
Administration big
time. And here is the truth. The truth
is that before Trump came in, the Social
Security Administration was
understaffed. And I as a senator and I
am sure that every member of Congress
and senator gets the same calls. We have
calls from constituent. We're trying to
get a hold of social security to talk
about an issue that we have. Can't do
it. You don't cut thousands and
thousands of workers from the Social
Security Administration when they are
already understaffed.
And let me tell you exactly what that
means. People who are old and with
disabilities die when they can't get the
benefits they are entitled to. That's a
fact. They have done it in the past. And
you cut the Social Security
Administration, you're going to see
thousands of people dying who should not
be dying. That is outrageous.
But it is not just social security
they're going after. You know, the
heroes and heroins of this country are
the men and women who have put their
lives on the line to defend us, our
veterans. We got any veterans here
today? Any veterans here
today? Thank you.
And at a time when the VA, the VA,
Veterans Administration is understaffed,
we don't have enough doctors or nurses,
mental health councils at the VA. They
have Musk and his friends have the
brilliant idea of firing
83,000 employees at the VA.
And that will mean lower quality health
care for our veterans and delays in them
getting the benefits that they deserve.
So what our message to Musk and Trump
are, we are not going to allow you to
destroy the Veterans Administration or
Social Security.
Now, when we talk about the kinds of
changes we need in America, it's
important to understand that the
oligarchs do not only have enormous
economic power. They do, but they also
have incredible and
unprecedented political
power. During the last election, Elon
Musk himself spent
$270 million in order to get Trump
elected.
And his reward for that 270 million was
to be made the most important person in
the United States government.
But it is not only Musk and Republicans
who put huge amounts of money to elect
right-wing candidates and to defeat
those who stand up for the working
class. It is Democratic billionaires as
well.
There is a reason why over the years the
Democratic Party has not been as strong
as it should be in standing up for the
working
class and that is the power of big money
in the Democratic party.
So I believe I believe honestly that I
speak for conservatives, moderates, and
progressives, for the overwhelming
majority of the American people who
understand that there is something
fundamentally wrong in our campaign
finance system when billionaires can buy
elections. And that is why together
we've got to get rid of this disastrous
Citizens United Supreme Court
decision and why we have to
move to public funding of elections.
You know, I may be a radical from
Vermont, and maybe I'm old-fashioned,
but I believe that democracy is one
person, one vote, not billionaires
buying elections.
But it's not just oligarchy and the
power of the
rich that we are fighting right now. We
are taking on a president who undermines
our constitution every day.
Who threatens our freedom of speech and
freedom of assembly.
We're taking on a president whose a
agents are riding around in unmarked
cars, grabbing people off of the
streets, putting them in vans, and
taking them to detention centers in this
country and abroad.
And I want you to picture, some of you
may have seen some of those videos.
Swarm of Asians come around, surround
some woman in Massachusetts, throw her
into a car. That is what takes place in
dictatorships, not democracies.
And as some of you
know, by a nine
to0 vote, the United States Supreme
Court told Trump to bring back that
gentleman from El
Salvador. And I think we can all be in
agreement. And again, this is not a
progressive issue. It's actually more a
conservative issue. Our conservative
friends say we support the constitution.
Well, if you support the constitution,
you don't throw people into detention
centers in El Salvador.
Every
day, every day, Trump is trying to take
more and more power away from the
Congress. He is in an unprecedented way
taking on the judiciary.
What what America is supposed to be
about is you have a judicial system and
sometimes they rule for you, sometimes
they rule against you. But I got to tell
you, I am no great fan of the Roberts
Supreme
Court. They gave us this terrible
decision on Roie
Wade, on Citizens United and other bad
decisions. But we live in a rule of law.
Donald Trump obey the Supreme Court of
the United
States. But he is not just trying to
user power from the Congress and the
judiciary. Apparently, Mr. Trump is
unfamiliar with the first amendment to
the Constitution, freedom of speech.
And in recent
months, the president of the United
States has sued
ABC,
CBS, Meta, the De Mo Register. His FCC
is now
investigating NPR and PBS.
And the other day, the other day he said
CBS should lose its
license. And what terrible crime did CBS
commit? They criticized policies of the
president of the United States. How
terrible for the president to be
criticized.
So, Mr. President, you're living in a
democracy whether you like it or
not. And part of living in a democracy
is to accept
criticism. And if you can't take
criticism, get out of the political
process.
You know, it's really rather
amazing suing media who write stories
that you don't like. This is a guy who
all of you know over the years has been
vulgar in his attacks against his
opponents. He can dish it out, make
terrible comments about anybody and
everybody. CBS writes a story that's
critical of him. Oh my god, they're got
to lose their
license. But it's not only the media.
Unbelievably, he is going after major
law
firms who have represented clients
opposed to his policies.
And I say to those cowardly law firms,
these are multibillion dollar law firms
who make huge sums of money every year
by doing business in Washington
representing corporate interests. The
function of a law firm is to protect the
rule of law, not cave in to
authoritarianism.
and he's going after
universities. These so-called
conservatives who believe in local
control now want to tell universities
and schools what they can and cannot do.
And I want to thank Harvard University
for standing up to Trump. And I hope
every university in this country does
the same.
The function of a
university and it is an enormously
important effort is the pursuit of truth
no matter where that truth takes you.
That's what it is. Vigorous debate on
the University of Montana and every
other university. The function of a
university is not to collapse in the
face of
authoritarianism. So universities stand
tall.
But it is not just domestic policies of
the Trump administration that should
concern us. For the first time,
embarrassingly, for the first time in
the 250 year proud history of the United
States, we have a president who is
aligning us with a dictatorship in
Russia. No, Mr. President, Ukraine did
not start that terrible war. Russia did.
And let me tell you something else. We
cannot continue to fund under Biden or
Trump this horrendous Netanyahu war
machine.
Israel Israel like the United States and
every other country has the right to
defend itself against
terrorism. But Israel does not have the
right to wage a barbaric war against the
people of Gaza.
kill over 50,000, wound 110,000, and
destroy the entire infrastructure of
Gaza. And let me tell you something that
is even worse and almost unimaginable.
And I the beginning I almost thought it
was a stupid joke, bad joke. And that is
right now Trump is talking about
forcibly
expelling the suffering people of Gaza
and creating a Riviera for the
billionaire class in
Gaza. The American people will not ever
allow that to
happen.
Our job, our job right now in this
pivotal moment in American history is to
take on Trump every single
day. But it is to do more than that. It
is to understand that in the wealthiest
country in the history of the world, we
can do a hell of a lot better than
having an
oligarchy. While the richest people in
America are becoming much
richer, 800,000 Americans are sleeping
out on the street.
We have the highest rate of childhood
poverty of almost any nation on earth.
And 22% of our seniors are trying to
survive on
$15,000 a year or less.
Brothers and sisters, the media doesn't
talk about it much and you don't hear
much about it in Congress.
60% of our people in America today are
living paycheck to
paycheck. You all know what paycheck to
paycheck life is
about. I grew up in a family that lived
paycheck to paycheck. I know a little
bit about what that is
like. And what it means is that every
day moms get up and say, "How can I
afford to provide decent quality food
for my
kids? What happens if my dad becomes
ill? How can I afford to buy the
prescription drugs that he needs? What
happens if my landlord raises my rent
and I can't afford to pay it?
What happens if my car breaks down and
the mechanic says I got a $1,000 bill? I
don't have a thousand bucks. How am I
going to get to work? What happens if I
can't get to work? I'm going to lose my
job. I lose my job. How do I feed my
family? Millions and millions of
workingclass people, low-income people
are living under incredible stress.
And do you know what the impact of that
stress is? They are dying in
significantly younger ages than they
should. Do you all know that in America
today our life
expectancy is four years lower than
other wealthy countries. But if you are
working class in America, you're going
to die seven years shorter than the
rich.
In the richest country in the history of
the world, it is not too much to ask
that all of our people have the right to
a decent life and decent life
expectancy.
You know, back in
1944, Franklin Delanor Roosevelt, one of
the great presidents in American
history, he gave a State of the Union
speech which didn't get a lot of
attention because it was in the middle
of World War II. But what he said, he
said in so many words, he said, you
know, in America, we have this
Constitution. It's great. Freedom of
speech, you have the right to vote,
freedom of religion, freedom of
assembly. But he said, you know what? We
don't fully appreciate we don't
appreciate that economic rights are
human
rights. See what the system does. We are
taking on a
system of enormous power. And one of the
things they are trying to do is to say
you have no rights. Say hey we'll let
you vote every four years to somebody
that we paid for. That's fine. No
problem. Hey, we g we bought this guy.
You could vote for him. You ain't going
to win anyhow. It doesn't matter if you
do
win. But this is what we will not give
you. We will not allow you as an
American system, American citizen, the
right, the right to have health care,
the right to have decent housing, the
right to have a job that pays you a
living wage. That we're not going to
give you.
So brothers and sisters, our job is to
really take that on in as bold a way as
we can. And to stand up and say, you
know what, we are human beings. Good. We
want the right to vote. Very important.
Freedom of speech, very important. But
you know what? in the richest country in
the history of the world where
technology is going to make us richer.
We want an economy that works for every
single man, woman, and child, not just
Mus and his billionaire
friends. So what does it mean?
It means that no, we are not going to
cut social security. We are going to
expand social
security. It means that at a time when
millions of workers are earning
starvation wages, we're going to raise
the minimum wage to a living wage.
No worker who works 40 hours a week
should live in poverty.
It means that no, we're not going to
give Musk and his billionaire friends a
tax break. We're going to demand they
start paying their fair share of taxes.
Does anybody here think that the
American health care system is working
well?
We are spending almost twice as much per
capita on health care, over $14,000 a
year, double what other countries are
spending. And yet we are the only major
country on earth not to guarantee
healthcare to all people as a human
right. 85 million of us are uninsured or
underinsured. Anybody here have a high
deductible? 60,000 people a year die
because they don't get to a doctor on
time. Brothers and sisters, it is not a
radical idea to understand that health
care is a human right. We must pass a
Medicare for all singlepayer program.
In Vermont and all over this country, we
have a housing crisis. And it is not
just 800,000 who are homeless. It is 20
million people who are spending half of
their limited income on housing.
Maybe, maybe, just maybe, instead of
spending a trillion dollars on the
militaryindustrial complex, we build 5
million units of lowincome and
affordable
housing. We live in a global economy and
we need the best educated workforce on
Earth.
Young people who want to get a higher
education, either in college or in trade
school, should not have to go tens of
thousands of dollars into debt.
Education not only makes it not only
makes important sense for our economy.
Education growing intellectually is
something that every human being is
entitled to. We must make public
colleges and universities tuition free
and cancel all student debt.
Now, Donald
Trump thinks that climate change is a
hoax.
He is dangerously dangerously wrong.
And our job is to lead the world in
transforming our energy system away from
fossil fuel into energy efficiency and
sustainable energy and create millions
of jobs as we do
that. You know, a lot of my Republican
friends, they talk about freedom and
freedom and freedom. Well, if this is
going to be a really free country, every
woman in America has the right to
control her own body.
Let me read something to you which was a
statement made in
1857 few years
ago by the great abolitionist Frederick
Douglas. You all remember Frederick
Douglas? I want you to hear what he
said. This is in the years preceding the
Civil War when the great struggle of the
time was whether or not this country
would end the nightmare of slavery.
Listen closely what Douglas said back
then and see its relevance for today. So
what he said and I quote, "Power conceds
nothing without a demand." Got that? In
other words, nobody on top is ever going
to give you something unless you demand
it. Then he continued, "It never did and
it never will." Find out just what any
people will quietly submit to, and you
have found out the exact measure of
injustice and wrong which will be
imposed upon them. And these will
continue till they are resisted with
either words or blows or with both. The
limits of tyrants are prescribed by the
endurance of those whom they
oppress. Brothers and sisters, we are
tired of being oppressed.
We believe in democracy, not
authoritarianism. We believe in an
economy that works for all, not just for
Musk and his fellow billionaires.
Brothers and sisters, let's stand
together. Let's go forward. Let us win
this struggle. Thank you.
Thank you.
