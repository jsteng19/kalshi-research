aluda this is this is an unbelievable turnout and I want to thank all of you
uh for being here this afternoon I want want to thank Altuna High
School Pisa music Joanna and Cindy and Bill for
their wonderful [Applause] remarks love love you
too and I got to tell you being here is like being in rural Vermont most of
Vermont vermonter live in towns like Altuna uh I would say well over half the
people in Vermont live in towns of 500 or less so in fact Altuna would be one
of the largest cities in the state of remont that's true um so why was I in kosha last night
we had a great turnout why am I here this afternoon why am I heading to waren
Michigan this evening and the answer is that we have some
serious problems in this country and together we're going to address [Applause]
them and given what is going on in Washington right
now how we respond to this moment and things are going on literally every day
pick up the paper something new is happening how we respond together to this moment
will impact not only our lives but our kids' lives and the future of this
planet so this what we are doing right now is making it clear here in Altuna and all
over this country that the American people and I believe this even whether you're conservative you're Progressive
your moderate independent Republican Democrat you know what the American people do not not want a handful of
billionaires to be running our [Applause]
government and the American people want a president and an Administration that
respects the Constitution [Applause]
and does not move us toward an authoritarian form of
society you know I got to tell you in Vermont I don't know how you do it here in Wisconsin but in Vermont and we just
had it a few days ago we have Town meetings all over the state small towns have meetings and they argue about how
much they want to put into the schools and the roads and everybody gets up and they yell and they scream and they do
their thing it's called
democracy and you know what I don't know how many of you remember this Winston Churchill said you know he said
democracy is the worst form of government except for all
others so we prefer the argu in and the yelling and the debating rather than
have a handful of people telling us how to live our [Applause]
lives and I've been thinking about something lately every year I go to a Memorial Day
Parade in a town called virgin's Vermont Northern Vermont it's a lovely parade a lot of people out and at the end of the
parade couple hundred people come to the town green and the organizers you know
people give speeches I give a speech and they always bring a kid from the high school up and they have that kid read
The Gettysburg Address that Lincoln gave in
1863 and that seems so relevant today in
1863 a few days after the terrible Battle of Gettysburg where thousands
tens of thousands of people had died fighting to end the horror of slavery
and Lincoln goes there a few days later and he looks out on the battlefield this is what he said some of you I'm sure
many of you are familiar with this he said that we here highly resolved that
these dead those people who had died in the Battle shall not have died in vain
that this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom and then he said
and that and that government of the People by the people for the people
shall not perish from the [Applause]
earth and that is why I am in Altuna with you today
let me let me tell you what we're up against and I want to be very honest with you
want you to think back some six weeks or so ago uh when Trump was inaugurated uh
as president and I was there I was kind of
right up front where you are they pushed I don't know why I ended up up front but I was there it's not exactly the front
Road seat that I wanted but there I was and right behind president Trump as
you may recall as he was taking the oath of office were the three wealthiest men
in the country Mr musk Mr Bezos and Mr
Zuckerberg but that's not enough standing behind those guys were 13 other
billionaires who were nominated by Trump to head up major government
[Applause] agencies in other words it was all there
for everybody to see they weren't hiding anything I got to give him credit for that you know the Trump Administration
is a government of the billionaire class by the billionaire class and for the
billionaire class you know for a number of
years I have been talking about how our nation is moving toward an oligarchic
form of society my friends we are no longer moving
toward oligarchy we are living in
[Music] [Applause] oligarchy and as we assemble here
today we are going to make it very clear that oligarchy is not what this country
is
about I want to tell you I want to mention something and I honestly
don't understand it we have people like musk and others
people who have more wealth they can fulfill all their family
needs for aund Generations I mean billions and billions of dollars and yet
despite all of their wealth they want more and more and more and I honestly
don't understand everybody here wants to be comfortable everybody here wants to make money we all want to retire with
dignity want to take care of our kids that's kind of natural but what these guys have is a very
serious problem you know we have in Vermont and I'm sure in Wisconsin serious addiction problems correct yes I
mean it is horrible I mean in Vermont we're really dealing with a lot of drug addiction with overdoses it's a national
problem we have people who have serious alcohol problems people have food problems tobacco a lot of people have
addictions but I will tell you what the most serious addiction is it is the
addiction of greed of this billionaire
[Applause] class I mean how much do you need to
live and there is no stopping them and what is scary is right now right now
they are prepared to dismember the federal government and cut programs that
lowincome and Working Class People desperately need so that they can give
themselves an enormous tax break of over $1
trillion by the way by the way the reason we have picked uh as I
mentioned earlier we were a couple of weeks ago in Omaha and Iowa City and
tonight here we're in various towns in the midwest it's not an accident where we are going the reason we are in this
community is you have a congressman who won by a somewhat slim margin now I am here we're doing a town
meeting now I come from Vermont well I think if I'm from Vermont doing a town
meeting here your own Congressman should come here
[Applause] and I think you should be very polite and respectful he gets a chance to talk
explain his point of view and you have the right to ask questions and I think
the key question in Wisconsin and all over America is why the hell is anybody
thinking of a trillion doll tax break for the one % and massive cuts to
Medicaid nutrition and [Applause]
education and here's the point again why I am here in the house as I think many
of you know the Republicans have it's very tight they have a three seat of majority just three out of 435 people if
two Republicans two Republicans members of the house go to their leader and say
you know what I got a lot of constituents who are on Medicaid I got a
lot of kids who need nutrition programs and you know what I am not
going to vote to cut Medicaid to give tax breaks to billionaires if two
Republican congressmen say that we have defeated their proposal that's what
we've got to do
[Applause] now what does what does an
888 billion doll cut to Medicaid meat it means that millions of kids right now
who are on Medicaid will be thrown off of their health insurance it means and
this is not widely known I know in Vermont that I think it's true all over the country we got nursing homes that
are really really struggling right okay 2third of the people who are in nursing
homes are funded by Medicaid so if you make massive cuts to Medicaid your mom
your dad may not be able to stay in a nursing home or get the quality of care
they need in that nursing home I have worked very hard over the years to
expand community health centers throughout Vermont
cuz I have the radical idea that when people get sick they should be able to walk into a doctor's
[Applause]
office and today some 32 million Americans utilize community health
centers that's Primary Health Care Dental Care is a big deal right mental health lower cost prescription drugs 40%
of the funding for community Health Centers comes from Medicaid you cut Medicaid significantly harder for people
to get Primary Health Care in America but what else are they going after it's not just
Medicaid it is also social
security at a time when millions of seniors are struggling to heat their
homes and we know what cold weather is about right or to buy prescription drugs musk
and his cohorts plan to fire over half the workers at the Social Security
Administration now what does that mean in real terms it means right now right now the Social Security
Administration is significantly under staff and I get calls every day from
people I'm trying to get a hold of Social Security they're not returning my calls it's taking me too long right
now if and there are some 30 I mean you want to hear something that is so horrible given the fact that we are the
richest country on earth is that 30,000 Americans die every year waiting for an
understaff Social Security to approve disability benefits today all right can
you imagine somebody's old they're on disability they can't get the benefits they Di die earlier than they should if
these Cuts go through the number of people who die will go up very
significantly that is not what this country is about and we're not going to allow that to [Applause]
[Music] happen but it is not just Medicaid that
they want to cut or social security they're going after the Veterans
Administration do we have any Veterans of Veteran families in the room right
now well thank [Applause]
you one of the honors of my life was that several years ago I chaed the
senate committee on Veterans Affairs and what I believe is what I
think the overwhelming majority of Americans believe no matter what their political view may be and that is when
somebody puts his or her life on the line to defend this country we keep the
promises we made to those [Applause]
veterans but musk and Trump recently announced there was a proposal out there
that they want to fire or they have a planned reduction
of 83,000 employees at the Veterans
Administration so what that means is to the veterans and in Vermont we have a really really good VA Hospital veterans
appreciate it and I'm sure that's true all over the country what it means is that the quality of Health Care that
veterans get will deteriorate the amount of time that it takes for them to get
the benefits that are do them will become even longer you do not balance
the budget on the backs of the men and women who defended this country
the Veterans of Foreign Wars that is the second largest veterans organization in
the country they said yesterday and I quote We Now call upon VA to reconsider
its planned reduction of 83,000 employees they are right they are
absolutely right and I call upon the Trump Administration to resend that
order
[Applause] [Music]
musk and Trump want to dismantle the Department of [Applause]
Education 27 million kids in lowincome and workingclass communities would see
their schools lose funding that means your property taxes would go up schools
would have less funding to attract teachers in addition pel grant funding would be cut
making it harder for kids to get a higher
education and if all of that is not bad enough in the
proposal to save money so that we can give tax breaks to the 1% Trump's budget
would cut nutrition assistance by at least
$230 billion now I want you to think about
that for a moment think about the fact that in the richest country on Earth we have
children who are hungry that's a disgrace unto itself but think for a
moment about the vulgarity of the richest people in the
world world trying to get more tax breaks and in the process cutting
nutrition programs for Hungry
children there is no world no Universe no religion on Earth where that is
morally acceptable [Applause]
so what's going on right now they are trying to dismember the federal
government and they lie a lot about what government does and does not do but in
the process hundreds of thousands of federal employees may lose their jobs and I want to say something and I want
you to think about this for a moment now people may say well that's you know really a bad thing I worry about
somebody losing their job how are they going to get buy are they going to get health care retirement all that stuff
and we all feel for those men and women but I also want to tell you that even if
you're not in the federal government pay close attention to what they are doing
and how they are doing it all of you know that there is going to be a
technological Revolution taking place right now and that is artificial intelligence and
Robotics so you're going to have computers and robots replacing human
labor okay now I happen to believe that if technology can make us more
productive that is a good thing but the benefits must go to the workers not just
those who own the technology
[Applause] [Music] [Applause] so if they are prepared to tell workers
at the federal government some of whom have dedicated their whole lives to Public Service hey you're out of here
goodbye tell me what you did last week you're out of here goodbye goodbye what do you think they're going to do to
people in the private sector when artificial intelligence comes you're
gone forget it you're out on the streets our job is to make sure that when you
have these Technologies it benefits all of us not just the few so pay attention to what's
going
on now I was uh the other day on Tuesday was uh at Trump's uh State of the Union
it's my job I went and what was very
interesting and it's important to pay attention to this uh Trump spoke for a
100 minutes I think it was the longest State of the Union ever and what he did is created I think
a parallel universe what these guys do which is you
know I'm not going to sit here and tell you the politicians don't lie politicians always have lied and they
always have stretched the truth that's the nature of the game but what we're seeing now is something very different
than what we have seen in the past it's one thing to stretch the truth to FIB a little bit here but we are now looking
at the phenomenon of the big lie you all know what that
means what a big lie is about is you say something
absurd that is latly false and you say it over and over and over again without
shame just just to give you a few examples just a
few Trump claimed that the 2020 election was stolen from him and that he won by a
landslide that's a lie and it's a lie think about what that lie means it's to
cast doubts on the way we do elections in America why do I want to bother the vote why do
I want to participate in democracy if somebody's going to steal the election that's what that's about Trump has
claimed that the January 6th Insurrection where people were trying to
deny Biden from becoming president he claimed that that Insurrection was a day
of love a lie and then this great lover of
Law and Order pardoned all these people who injured over a 100 police officers on Capital
Hill Trump has claimed again trying to destroy faith in the Democratic process
he has claimed that millions of undocumented people vote in American elections a
lie he has claimed that climate change is a hoax originating in China
and then more recently he has claimed that Ukraine started the horrific war
with Russia but it was not just Trump a
couple of months ago and I had worked very hard I was chairman of a committee called the health education labor committee and we work really hard on
some public health programs which would have expanded funding for community health centers would lowered the cost of
prescription drugs as part of a bigger bill called the continuing resolution Democrats Republicans worked really hard
for months literally the day when Congress and the house was going to vote
on this musk started putting out emails on his Twitter platform and he said
members of Congress don't vote for this legislation it's terrible it will give
members of Congress a 40% increase in their salary inre
40% total lie it was a 3.4%
increase and as a result of what musk did that important legislation Was
Defeated and just last week at his speech the president repeated the claim
that musk started that zillions you all heard zillions of dead people between
the ages of 100 and 500 are collecting Social Security
checks total and what's what is the reason for doing that you tell me why do
you do that hold on raise your hand somebody raise a hand yeah why put doubt
in Social Security good exactly young man here said put doubt in Social SEC
look if you're standing out there and somebody says H the whole system is broken people are
200 years old collecting Social Security massive fraud people say Jesus do we really want to keep the system that is
the purpose so let's be clear well over 99% of Social Security checks are going
out to people who earned those [Applause]
checks Social Security [Music] has been the most successful and popular
program in American history it's a program that has kept millions of seniors from poverty we're not going to
let them destroy Social [Applause]
[Music] Security what these guys are trying to
do when they lie and lie and lie they create a situation in which instead of having
serious and honest discussion people have different points of view what do we do about social security what do we do
about Healthcare what do we do about education important issues what we end up spending half our lives doing is not
discussing those issues but we end up trying to respond to these absolute
lies now I want you to think back I don't know how many of you saw a trump speech but if you listen
to his State of the Union speech what you observed is that in fact he had
relatively little to say about the State of the
[Applause] Union almost nothing you know when you
talk about the State of the Union what it is okay what is going on what's going on in the country you know what are the
what are the needs of the people what kind of pain are we seeing how do we respond that's what you do people can
disagree but that's what you do unbelievably Trump spoke for a 100
minutes and he almost completely ignored the issues that are keeping millions of
workingclass people up at night as they worry about how their families are going
to survive in these very difficult times now let us this afternoon do
something really radical you ready let us actually do what Trump did
not do and that is take a look at what is going on in our country especially
for Working Families let's start off with the sad
reality that in the richest country in the history of the world today 60% of Americans are living
paycheck to paycheck you all know what living paycheck to paycheck is
about I grew up in a family that lived paycheck to
paycheck and what I the environment that I grew up in the life that I had has
shaped who I am as a person and in fact my political
views it means [Applause]
all you know what I'm going to tell you what living paycheck to paycheck but you know it better than I do raise your hand
what is it like living paycheck to paycheck who wants to hold on one at a time I can't yes well terrible all right
yes hungry hunger all right let me get some hands back there be loud we got a
hand there okay ma'am stressful stay on that issue sir you're not sure if you're going to be
able to keep the heat on you're not sure if you're going to be able to keep the heat on yes ma'am
trying to find a way to plan a meal for your NE until your next paycheck comes
ma'am forget about buying shoes and clothes for your kids
ma'am skipping doctor's visits okay I see a hand back there sir
yeah fear that your world is going to fall apart
sir am I getting glasses or can I get them for my kids sir for the future
can't plan for the future hand back there sir psycholog Warfare okay
psychological warfare
yes you make impossible decisions for your family sir in General insecurity okay I think
you got it so let me just let me just tell you something on a personal
level my mom died young her dream we lived in an apartment
our whole lives rent control apartment her dream what she wanted more than anything was to own our own house and we
never achieved that we couldn't own we didn't have the money to own our own house and and other
things today today in America we live as a nation shorter
lives than people in other wealthy countries our life expectancy is low do you all know that so we live about four
years shorter lives than people in Europe or Japan
Etc and that's bad but I'm going to tell you something that is even worse that is
almost never discussed at all and that is if you are working class in the
United United States of America you live seven years shorter life on average than
do wealthy people in other words being and I'm not
just talking about poor people who are living out on the street they don't live very long I talk about working class in
general seven years shorter lives than the people on top why is that help me
out here all right you know what I'm hearing I'm hearing the word stress
all right all right and that's what a lot of your responses were deals with
stress what does it mean and we heard this just now if you're worried about whether or not you could buy shoes for
your kids what does it mean if you're worried that your landlord's going to raise the rent and you can't afford to
pay that rent where you going to live what does it mean if you're car breaks down and you got a $1,000 repair bill
but you can't afford the th000 Bucks you don't have a car you can't get to work and what happens if you can't get to
work what does it mean if your kid says Mom I'm sick and you can't afford to
take her to the doctor you add all of that up what does it mean if your boss tells you guess
what you're working the midnight shift because you don't have a regular schedule you add all of that stuff up
that economic pressure how do I survive it wrecks havoc on our bodies and it
wrecks havoc on our [Applause]
minds if we were a poor country I would come before you and give
you a very different speech I'd say hey look I'm sorry we're poor we can't afford decent education can't afford
decent Healthcare can't afford to protect the environment I want you never to forget we are the
richest country in the history of the world there is no excuse for people
dying young because of that [Applause]
stress now not only of course did Trump not deal with that
reality unbelievably 100 minute speech he didn't say one word about
Healthcare how many of you think the Health Care system in America works
well well you're right we are spending twice as much per capita on health care
as the people of any other Nation 85 million are uninsured or underinsured
60,000 people die every year because they don't get to a doctor when they should somehow or another Mr Trump
forgot to talk about Healthcare maybe it has to do with the
fact that he didn't want to antagonize his friends in the insurance industry and the pharmaceutical
industry we pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs you all
know that sometimes 10 times more than what Canadians or Europeans are paying I
didn't hear one word from the president G dealing with the reality that one out of four Americans can't afford the
prescriptions their doctors prescribe amazingly
enough in Vermont I don't know about here we have a major housing
crisis you got 800,000 Americans are homeless and we got 20 million people
spending more than 50% of their limited incomes on housing so if you're spending
50 % what do you got left not much all right not one word not
one word on the housing crisis today in America we have more income and wealth
inequality than we've ever had not one word from the president on that not one
word on the fact that the three richest guys in the country were standing right behind them own more wealth than the
bottom half of American society got that
and needless to say the president had nothing to say about the existential
threat of climate change other than drill baby drill which
will make a dangerous situation even
worse but it is not only domestic policies that Trump is doing us Wrong by
let's take a look at what's going on internationally you know we all grew up understanding that America is the
longest standing democracy in the history of the world we're proud of
[Applause] that and I'm not here to tell you that our foreign policy has always been right
it has not but at the end of the day for people all over the world the truth is
they did they did look to the United States they read our Declaration of Independence they
read our Constitution which is a really extraordinary document being you know written in the 18th century they look to
America as a nation of democracy and freedom and for the first time in the
history of our country we have a president who is
siding aying himself with a ruthless dictator in Russia
[Applause] and not only that and this is an issue I
have paid a lot of attention to maybe differences of opinion here but I have
very strongly opposed the us giving military aid to the Netanyahu government
in Israel [Music]
[Applause] [Music]
Trump wants to continue the very dumb policies that Biden had and provide more
money for Netanyahu I'm going to do whatever I can with other members of the
Senate to stop more arm CES going to
Israel and also you know when you think about who we are is a people and we are
proud of our Democratic Heritage we're proud of our generosity who we are as a
people if you can believe it Trump is now telling the 2.2 million people who
are in Gaza who have suffered horribly 45,000 dead mostly women and kids whole
infrastructure wiped out over 100,000 wounded and you know what he's telling them now you have to leave your Homeland
cuz we want to build a playground a Riviera for the [Applause]
rich that is almost unspeakable now let me just say that it
is not good enough for us to be on the defense fighting Trump and musk every
step of the way we got to do that but we have to do something more and that is get on the offense
and by that what do I mean by that the truth of the matter is it may not you
may not see it on TV or read it in the papers but the truth of the matter is and we ped on this a dozen times the
American people want fundamental changes in the way government does business they
want a government that works for them not the billionaire class
[Music] [Applause] so let me very briefly tell you
something that is not Bernie Sand's idea not your idea it's ideas supported by
the overwhelming majority of the American people Democrats Republicans Independents number one the American
people want to end the corrupt campaign Finance system that we have
does anybody in America believe that it is appropriate for somebody like musk to
contribute $270 million to Trump's
campaign and then you get rewarded by becoming the most important man in
government but I got to tell you it is not just musk and Republicans it is
democratic billionaires as
well we are not going to make progress on the issues facing Working Families
unless we have campaign Finance reform unless we get rid of this disastrous
Supreme Court decision on citizens united
and unless we move to Public Funding of Elections you know what else the
American people think they don't think we should be giving tax breaks to
[Applause]
billionaires and at a time when millions of people all over our country are
working for starvation wages the American people want us to end this OB
absurdity of having a 7 and a quarter federal government minimum wage raise
the minimum wage to a living wage $17 an [Applause]
hour do we have any union members here okay all over this country workers
increasingly understand that if they're going to get decent decent wages decent
benefits decent working conditions they've got to join a
union and millions of people want to join Union but they're running against
corporate opposition if you want to be a join a union you're going to get fired
you're going to be taken into a back room be lectured about how terrible unions are you're going to be threatened vote for Union we're taking this plant
to China all of that stuff is illegal go but they get away with it that is why we
got a pass legislation I just introduced the proact making it punishing those
corporations who act illegally when workers are trying to form [Applause]
unions and here's something else the American people understand right now 22%
of seniors are living on $115,000 a year or less can you believe
that 50% of seniors are living on 30,000 or less no we're not going to cut Social
Security we're going to expand Social Security [Applause]
[Music] benefits and here's an issue that the American people also understand there is
something fundamentally wrong when we are the only major country on Earth not
to guarantee Health Care to all people as a human right
[Applause]
the function the function of a sane and rational Health Care
system is not to provide huge profits for the insurance industry and the drug
companies the function of a sane system is to provide quality care to
all we are spending twice as much for have enough as other countries we don't
even have enough doctors we don't have enough nurses we don't have enough dentists we don't have enough
pharmacists so we got to take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry and
the insurance companies healthc care is a human right let's pass Medicare for all
in the United States of America we can solve the housing crisis
by building at least 4 million units of lowincome and affordable housing let's
put people to work union jobs let's do [Applause]
[Music] it and I want you to think about another Insanity we need we're living in a
competitive global economy we need the best educated Workforce in the world and
yet kids young people families going deeply deeply into debt for what so
their kids can get a decent education we should be doing what other countries do
make public colleges universities trade schools tuition
free and it's not just the college degree we need plumbers we need
electrican we need Carpenters we need Apprentice programs
which give those kids that education without worrying about the [Applause]
C and I hear a whole lot of talk about freedom freedom well if anybody in
congress believes in Freedom then stand with the women in this country who should have the freedom to control their
own bodies
look I know let me let me conclude and you've been very patient and I
appreciate that I gone on longer than I thought but
thank you look this is a difficult moment in
the history of our country but I think we all understand that it is not the
first difficult moment in the history of our country and In This Moment despair is
not an option can't do it
hiding under the covers as much as we would like to and turning off the TV is not an
[Applause] option all of you
know that real change real change only
occurs not from the top on down but from the bottom on up
[Applause] [Music]
it occurs when ordinary people stand together against wealth in power and
Injustice and I want you all to remember in these difficult times remember that
when this country was founded think about it back in the 1770s you you got these Colonial guys
and they had to take on the entire British
Empire think about it and people said you can't do that that's crazy King of England most powerful guy in the world
they stood together they took him on and they won and we became the United
[Applause]
[Music] States think about the 1830s 1840s the
Abolitionist Movement when people many parts of the country said slavery is
immoral it's horrific we cannot allow it to continue they had to take on
enormously powerful forces and we fought a terrible Civil War but slavery was
abolished and to the brothers the sisters in the labor movement think about the history of the American labor
movement think about the early part of the 20th centuries when kids were working in
factories when people were working seven days a week when people had no rights on
the job and workers said to their employers we want a union and employer said go to
help and workers had to fight and they got beaten up and sometimes they got
killed I was just reading today back in the
1936 you know how the UAW was formed they did a sit in they took over the General Motors factories in Flint
Michigan they stood up and they [Applause]
fought and the result of that is we have a union movement that helped create the
middle class of this country and think about this struggles
of Dr King in the Civil Rights Movement think about the women's
[Applause] movement women fought and died and went
to jail to get women the right to vote in the 1920s and the environmental
movement and the gay movement so I understand and you
understand that the oligarchs are enormously
powerful they control our economy they control much of the media they have
enormous influence over our politics and our political
system but from the bottom of my heart I believe they can be defeated and we're
going to do that
[Applause] now their
strategy their strategy is not complicated they understand that when we
stand together we win when they divide us up they win and their goal is to
divide us up by the color of our skin where we were born our sexual
orientation our religion and we're not going to let them do
that so when we stand together not only are we going to defeat the oligarchs in
my humble opinion we can create a government that works for all of us not
just the few let's go forward together let's do it thank you
the people to the
people to the people to the
people to the people right say we want a re
sh we better get on my way we get on
your be the Shing power to the
people power to the people power to the
people
to
e for
