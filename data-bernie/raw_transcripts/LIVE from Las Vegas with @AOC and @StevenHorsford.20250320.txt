you this is a great turnout fact I've been to Las Vegas number of times this
is by far the largest turnout thank
you I want to thank all the Andrea for being here with
us you know she mentioned when she was a kid she cleaned houses with her mom in
order to help pay the family bills she has not forgotten where she came
from I want to thank Steve mber who worked for the culinary Workers
Union former chairman of the black caucus and doing a great job in the
Congress Steve thanks very
much so why are Alexandria and I here in
Las Vegas and we're heading to Colorado and we're heading to
Arizona we are doing that because this country faces enormous
crisis and how we respond to these crisis today will impact not only our
lives but the lives of our kids future generations and in terms of
climate change the very well-being of the
planet and so today we are here to say
very loudly and clearly no we will not
accept an oligarchic form of society where a handful of billionaires run the
government no we will not accept an authoritarian form of
[Music] society with a president who undermines
the Constitution every day and is working aggressively to take away our freedom of
speech and freedom of of assembly no we will not accept a society
of massive economic inequalities where the very rich are
becoming much richer while working families across the country struggle to
put food on the [Music] table what we're saying today as clearly
as we can that in the richest country in the history of the world we demand and
will achieve an economy and a government that works for all of us not just
for it seems to me that before we can effectively determine the best way
forward it's important to do what is very rarely done in Congress or in the corporate media
and that is to have a Frank discussion about the economic and political
realities facing our country so let's do something really radical you
ready let's tell the truth
in our country today we have two very different
Americas in one of those Americas the wealthiest people have never ever in the
history of our country had it so good people on top are doing
extraordinarily well today we have more income and wealth inequality in our
country than and we have ever had the three wealthiest people in America Mr
musk Mr Bezos Mr [Applause]
Zuckerberg you know those guys those three people alone own more
wealth than the bottom half of American
society7 million people eat the
people 170 million
people the top 1% now owns more wealth than the bottom
90% And CEOs of major corporations now make
300 times what they average workers [Music]
make but it's not just income and wealth inequality today we have more
concentration of ownership than we have ever had while the prophets on Wall
Street and Corporate America saw a handful of giant corporations dominate
sector after sector whether it's agriculture Transportation media
Financial Services small number of very very large International corporations
Domin and they charge us outrageously high prices for the
products they sell us if you could believe it three Wall
Street firms three firms Black Rock Vanguard and State
Street combined are the major stockholders of 95% of American
corporations and let me say this the
1% live completely and isolated lives
from the rest of this country they have no clue what is going on in the real
world they live in their mansions and their gated communities they fly around the world
and the private jets or the helicopters that they own they have well-trained
nanni taking care of their babies they send their kids to the best private schools
and colleges sometimes they take vacations not in a Motel
6 not in a national park but in their very own islands that they
own and for the very very richest they have FL they have fun flying off into
out of space on their very own spaceships and maybe they should stay
[Applause] there that is one America an America
where people live with tremendous wealth and tremendous luxury they have it all
but there is another America the America that you know and the America you live
in and in that America 60% % 60% of our
people are living paycheck to paycheck and millions of workers are
trying to get by on starvation wages unlike Donald Trump I grew up in a
family that lived paycheck to paycheck and I know as you know something about
that reality and it is a reality that I will never forget
and I have a feeling as I look out at you today that many of you know that
reality now here's something that we don't talk about too much what does it mean what does it mean to live paycheck
to paycheck tell me what's it mean robing Peter to pay
Paul oh raise your hand let me get to some people yes going without yes no Heth
Insurance knowing how to figure out your how to pay your credit card when
interest rates are 20% if you're delinquent right yes
ma' how to put one's kids through college yes wanting to buy a house how
you going to have figure that one out yes sir
[Music] paying whether or not you're going to
buy your prescription drugs or you pay your
rent go in hungry in America Way the back there
yeah wanting to go to college I have the money to do that
yeah okay yeah yes
ma okay stress every day to pay the rent that's what it's about all right we go
look I know we can go to everybody in the thousands here who'll give me a different answer but here is the bottom
line it means that millions of Americans worry every day we just heard it how
they going to pay their rent or how they going to pay their mortgage and as Alexandria mentioned a moment ago all
over this country the cost of housing is Sor so what do you do if you're living
paycheck to paycheck and you landlord raises your rent 30% you got to figure out where you're
going to go if you have a kid you got to find another school it is a disaster how do you live if you're a
single mom paying $20,000 a year for child care when you're making 4 or $50,000 a
year people want to feed their kids well want decent food for Di how do you
provide decent food for kids when the prices at the grocery store store are
soring if you get sick your kid gets sick your mom or your dad get sick how do you afford to go to the
doctor if you have no health insurance or you have a $10,000 a year
deductible how do you pay your credit card bill people have credit card bills
here and if you don't pay it w gets 20% 30% interest
rates people all over this country just worry about what happens if you're
living paycheck to paycheck and your car breaks down and the guy at the repair
shop says it's costing 1,000s to get it fixed well what happens if you don't
have that th000 bucks how do you get to work and what happens if you don't get
to work what Happ if you get fired how you going to take care of your families those are the stresses there
are tens of millions of Americans are experiencing let me tell you something
that is almost never ever talked about no no in America today our life
expectancy how long we live on average is about four years shorter than people
in most other wealthy countries but what is even more
embarrassing is that working class working class Americans are living seven
years shorter lives than the
wealthy why is that why is that raise your hands yes
ma'am all right this woman hit the right on the head the answer is
stress what doctors will tell you St a new medical fact is that when you live
under stress every day trying to figure out how you going to feed your kids how you going to pay the rent you know how
you deal with a boss who is not very pleasant all right right dealing with
Trump all of that stress has an impact on your body and your
mind and in the richest country in the world working class people should not
have to die unnaturally young they should be able to live long and
productive the issue that we're dealing with in America now is not just income
and wealth inequality and it's not just the stress that working people are feeling today in America we are the only
major Nation on Earth does not guarantee Health Care to all people as a human
right despite spending twice as much per capita you got it's not that we're not
spending enough money we're spending a fortune $14,000 for every man woman and
child despite that 85 million Americans are uninsured or
underinsured all right raise your hand if you have a high deductible there it is in America today
60,000 people die because they don't get to a doctor on time got it and the
reason is and I talk to doctors people walk in much sicker than they should be
and they say doctors say well why didn't you come in here when you first felt your symptoms answer is I had no health
insurance or I had a high deductible right healthare there is a human
rights together we are going to stand up and fining pass and Medicare for all
single
program today because of the greed of the pharmaceutical
industry anybody here having a hard time paying for prescription drugs
one out of four Americans can't afford to fill the prescriptions their doctor's
right because in some cases we pay 10 times more for the same drugs as swn AB
so as sold abroad there is no reason why we should pay the highest prices in the world for
prescription drugs let us stand together and demand that Congress lower the cost
of prescription drugs by at least 50%
all over this country we've got a housing crisis got a housing crisis here in Las
Vegas it's not just that we have 800,000 people who are homeless that's bad
enough but you got 20 million people in America paying
50% of their limited incomes for housing we got an education crisis child
care dysfunctional very expensive the workers there make low wages public education
doesn't have enough money to attract the teachers that we
need and millions of young people are struggling to figure out how they are
going to get a higher education and in terms of climate change
we now embarrassingly have a president who believes that climate change is a
[Music] [Applause] hopes which means that we're going to fall further and further behind than
trying to save the planet so why is all of this stuff happening why are we the
only country that doesn't guarantee Health Care why are the rich getting richer and working paying full
Str oh it's a smart audience you got it you know we all know
it's true in Vermont and I'm sure it's true here we all know people who are
dealing with addiction right drug addiction is a horrendous problem I think we lost 100,000 people
because of drug overdoses we know people who are alcoholic who need more and more to
drink we know people who can't control themselves with food or tobacco but I will tell you that the worst Addiction
in this country today is the greed of the oligarchy [Applause]
they are like heroin addicts they need more and more and more and if they
destroy Social Security and Medicaid to get what they want that is what they
will do and right now as Alexandria mentioned
they are in the process of dismembering the federal government and cutting programs that low income and Working
Families desperately need so they can give themselves over a trillion dollars
in huge tax [Applause]
breaks and in order to get those tax breaks they want to cut Medicaid by
$880 billion they want to destroy our social
security system at a time when 22% of seniors are trying
to get by on $115,000 a year or less what they are
trying to do is to discredit Social Security lie about social security some
of you heard Trump say oh all these people 150 200 years of age getting Social
Security toal total absolutely well over 99% of the people in this country get
those Social Security checks paid for those checks we got any veterans here
today thank you veterans the must and Trump are going
after the VA they want to lay off over 880,000
employees at the Veterans [Applause]
Administration that will result in low quality healthare and delays in veterans
getting the benefits to which they are entitled Trump and musk right now today
they're trying to dismantle the Department of
Education that means public schools in working class areas could lose money it
means that people on pel grants are going to have a hard time getting those
grants and it means it means that kids with disabilities who are now getting the
support they need may lose that [Music]
support the way you destroy the government is by laying off hundreds of
thousands of employees and that is precisely what they are doing right now
and I want you all to think about this for a moment I know we all feel badly
for those federal employees people have worked for the government for years to bet devoted their lives to public
service and you have must coming along and say oh we've determined your performance is for you're out of here
[Music] goodbye now I know a lot of people feel
sympathy for those employees but I want you to think about something if musk and
his friends can treat federal employees like that you worked here 20 years
you're out of here goodbye what do you think that they will be doing to workers
in the private sector when artificial intelligence comes to take your
[Music] job now technology in itself is not a
bad thing if it works for working people not just the people on
top I mean it's not just domestic policies of the Trump
Administration that we've got to fight for the first time in our
250e history we have a president who is turning his back on democracy and
allying us with authoritarianism and murderers like Vladimir
[Applause] Putin no we must not abandon the people
of Ukraine who were invaded Mr
president Ukraine did not start this morning Russia
did our country must always stand for democracy not
dictatorship know at a time when Netanyahu is waging a horrific
war against the Palestinian people our government must not provide
another nickel to that murderous
my friends it is no great secret that our government is way out of
touch with the needs of Working Families I don't think anybody would deny it you
have two- party system both parties heavily dominated by Big Money
interest so our job in the coming weeks and months is not not just to take Trump
on in every step of the way but it's to do more it's to have a vision for where
our country should be going as the wealthiest Nation on Earth
for beginning to begin it's important to know that we are not going to make the changes we need so long as we continue
to have a corrupt campaign Finance
system it is not democracy when musk himself could spend
$270 million to help elect Trump and then become the most powerful person in
[Applause] government and there are billionaires in the Democratic party also playing a
major role our job is to overturn this horrendous Supreme Court decision on
citizens united to move this country the Public
Funding of Elections one person one vote not billionaires buying
elections no we should not be giving huge tax breaks to billionaires on the
contrary we've got to demand that they start paying their fair share of
ta no [Applause]
that sounds pretty good up here while we're at it we cannot
maintain a federal minimum wage of $725 an
hour going to raise that minimum wage to a living wage at least 17 bucks an hour
and we all over this country workers know that if you want decent wages and
benefits in working conditions you got to join a
union and all over this country corporations are making it harder and harder for workers to join unions and
that's why we need to pass legislation that I just introduced called the proa
that penalizes any employer that acts illegally when workers are trying to form a union
together we're going to stop the cuts to Social Security instead of cutting
Social Security we're going to expand Social
Security instead of making massive cuts the Medicaid we're going to join every
other major country on Earth guarantee Health Care to all to a better care for
and in the wealthiest country on Earth you know what nobody should go homeless nobody should pay 50% of their income in
housing we can't create millions of jobs by building four million units of low
income and affordable housing and stopping corporate landlords
from jocking up rent prices I grew up in a rent control
Department seems to me that's a pretty good ideal yeah and in a competitive global economy
we need the best educated Workforce in the world all of our young people must have
the ability to get a higher education by making public colleges and universities
and trade schools you and universities tuition free
and 10 we are led the effort for the green new jobs creating millions of good
paying jobs Transforming Our Energy System to save the planet let's do
it I know that there are a lot of
people uh here in Las Vegas and around the country uh who are feeling despair
and anxiety about what's happening in DC and some of you may feel a little bit
hopeless so let me say this at this particular moment this pivotal moment in
American history despair is not an option giving up is not
acceptable and none of us have the privilege of fighing under the covers
what are you going to states are just do about it and let us
never forget real change only occurs when ordinary people at the Grassroots
level stand up against oppression and Injustice and fight
back that is the history of our country from way back
when when this country was first formed you had people here who took on the most
powerful person in the world the king of England and the entire British Empire and you know what they
won in the 1840s you had people in the Abolitionist Movement standing up and
saying slavery is not acceptable it's horrendous it's horrific they had to
take on the great power of the slave owners and we fought a war where
hundreds of people hundreds of thousands of people died but we won slavery was
abolished the early part of our Century workers who were overworked and
underpaid demanded to form Union some of them were killed they were fired they were beaten but they stood up for the
Trade union movement and they won and helped create the American milary
in the 1930s we had a depression 25% of America was unemployed but people
stood up elected a great President Franklin Delo Roosevelt transformed the
government and we managed to end the Depression in
1941 country was attacked at Pearl Harbor our military was weak we had to
fight a war on two fronts yet because the nation came together and we produced
the planes the guns the tanks that we needed in 2 and 1/2 years that war was essentially
[Music] one so what I am saying to
you is that this is not the first time we have faced crisis and what I believe
from the bottom of my heart is the American people do not want to see a
handful of of billionaires running this country the American people understand
that in democracy we criticize each other we have free elections and we're
not like Donald Trump too cowardly to accept
criticism American people do not let to move us toward an authoritarian
Society the American people understand that there's something very very wrong
today when so few have so much and so many have so
little so my view is that while I am not a
mathematician I do know that 99% is a hell of a lot bigger number than
1% I believe from the bottom of my heart if we do not let Trump and his friends
divide us up by the color of our skin or where we were born or our religion or
our sexual orientation if we stand together as one
people fighting for justice there is nothing that we cannot
do trust me I work in Washington and I know the power of the olar they all very
powerful but if we stand together I have zero doubt that we can and will defeat
them that we can transform the economics and politics of this country and that we
can have an economy and a government that works for all of us not just the 1%
thank you all
[Applause]
