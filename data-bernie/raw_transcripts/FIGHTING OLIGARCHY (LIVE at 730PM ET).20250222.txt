let me Begin by thanking all of you for coming out what a turnout thank you very
[Applause]
much let me thank Eric Williams for his
remarks precious messen and a special word to Ron
Kaminsky of the laborers [Applause]
union when we were originally planning the trip here to Omaha we were going to
do it at the laborers union hall but then the RSVPs started to come
[Applause] in so told Ronnie either you have to
break down the walls or we're going someplace else here we are thank you
[Applause]
again so why am I here in Omaha Nebraska
tonight why will I be going Iowa City tomorrow
why do we intend as progressives to go to every corner of this
[Applause] country and the
answer is pretty obvious this country
today under Trump faces a series of
Crisis unprecedented in our modern history and what we we do now will
impact not only our lives but the lives of our kids
grandchildren future Generations or whether the planet itself
[Applause] survives I'm here in Omaha because the
time to act is now the time to fight back is
now and let me give you some good news and bad news the bad news is that in my view and
I have some knowledge and experience in this as a US
senator trumpism will not be defeated by
politicians inside the DC Beltway
that is not going to happen it will be
defeated by millions of Americans in Nebraska in Iowa in Vermont and all over
this [Applause]
country who come together at the Grassroots level like we
are doing doing tonight in a movement which says no to
oligarchy no to [Music]
authoritarianism no to kleptocracy no to massive Cuts in
programs that the working class desperately needs
[Applause] and no to huge tax breaks for the
billionaires and the [Applause]
1% and that my friends is why we're here in Omaha
tonight so let me tell you what in my view is going on in our country today
first we are rapidly moving moving toward an oligarchic form of
society in which a handful of multi billionaires not only have
extraordinarily extraordinary wealth but unprecedented
economic media and political
power and this is no great secret what I will say about Trump he's out front he
shows you what he's doing I was there at the inauguration and seated right behind
Trump was Elon Musk Jeff
Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg the
three you know those guys they are the three wealthiest
people in America right behind the president as he's getting swor in but
that's not enough behind those guys are the kind of poor
billionaires they only worth you know 10 20 billion 13 of them who were nominated by
Trump to be in his cabinet
but it is not only that Trump is surrounded and working for the
wealthiest people in this country that is one reality let me tell you another reality that I know that many of you
know all too well and that is that while the people on top have never ever had it
so good the Working Families of our country in Vermont Nebraska all over
this country are struggling to just make ends
meet all over this country major housing
crisis all over this country major health care
crisis all over this country the price of food going up at the grocery
store cost of child care College unaffordable
and working people are struggling they're struggling to pay the bills
older people are wondering how they can put aside a few bucks so maybe they
could just retire with a little bit of dignity here in the richest country in
the history of the [Applause]
world so in America today right now you don't see it much on TV or in the papers
but right now we have more income and wealth inequality than we have ever had in the
history of the United States those three
guys musk Bezos and Zuckerberg who stood behind Donald Trump have more wealth
than the bottom half of American society 70 million
people today the top 1% owns more wealth than the bottom
90% And while the very wealthiest people become phenomenally
Richer there is another reality because we are living in two
Americas for the people on top never ever has it been so good but for working
people people the struggle continues just to
survive if you can believe it and again we don't talk about it enough
60% of our people in America today are living paycheck to
paycheck you all know what that means I grew up in a family in a rent
control Department we live paycheck to paycheck and I will never forget the stress that
my parents dealt with every day in terms of how they pay the bills how they
provide for their kids that is what 60% of our people in this country today are
dealing with in America today 85 million of our people are uninsured
or underinsured now you don't hear about it much I was
chairman of the committee that dealt with this stuff over 60,000 Americans die every year because
they cannot afford to go to a
doctor one out of four Americans cannot afford the outrageously High Cost of
prescription drugs that the pharmaceutical industry charges us
20 million Americans are living trying to survive
on wages less than $15 an
hour 25% of our senior citizens are trying to
live on incomes of $155,000 a year or
less can you believe that I don't know I frankly don't know how anybody let alone
a senior who has higher Health Care needs how does anybody live on $15,000 a
year or less and yet the rich get richer and that is the reality for Working
Families but when we talk about oligarchy and what's going on in this
country it's not just that the rich are getting richer while working families struggle aligar is about political
power in a way that we have never seen in the history of America it's about
people like Elon Musk
contributing $270 million do to Trump's election
campaign but it's not just musk it is not just musk and it is not
just Republicans billionaires contribute to the Democratic party as
well and that is why if we're going to restore democracy to this country we got
to get rid of the citizens united Supreme Court decision
[Applause]
democracy is not about billionaires buying elections it's
about one person one vote and that is why in my view we got
to move to Public Funding of
Elections and let me tell you how bad and corrupt the situation is musk
himself not only has contributed a huge amount of money to Trump and as a result
got his reward of being the most important person in the Trump Administration he is also playing a
major role with his wealth all over the world in Germany
tomorrow in Germany tomorrow very important an election mus has supported
a right-wing extremist party
and to tell you how crazy it is how arrogant these people are in your
neighboring state of Wisconsin they're having an election for a Supreme Court
Justice not the most important position in the world but it appears that one of the
candidates believes that a woman has the right to control her own body
[Applause]
and if you can believe it Elon Musk is getting involved in that
campaign to defeat that
candidate so let's be clear when we are taking on
trumpism we are taking on oligarchy
and you know lately I have been remembering I
remember both uh what I learned in probably the sixth grade but also every
year in a city called virgin's Vermont I go to the memorial day uh parade it's a
beautiful event and every year we go up on the platform and the uh people who do
the parade bring up some high school kid to read Abraham Lincoln's speech at
Gettysburg okay and that was let me tell you what that speech was about and how important it is today there is Lincoln
in Gettysburg days after this terrible terrible battle thousands of people
soldiers died in order to end the Hara of slavery and Lincoln looks out on that
fields and he honors those who gave their lives and he says and I quote that
we he High resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain that this nation
under God shall have a new birth of freedom and that government of the
People by the people for the people shall not perish from the Earth
[Applause]
and that is what we believe in that's what people brave men and women for 250
years fought and died for that is how we became the model for
the rest of the world people look to America and they said how come Ordinary People can vote can elect their leaders
why can't we and our determination right now is to fulfill Lincoln's vision of of
a government of the People by the people for the people and not a government of
the billionaires by the billionaires and for the billionaires that we will not allow
to [Applause]
happen but brothers and sisters we're not just fighting oligarchy we are
fighting Trump's rapid movement toward authoritarianism in this
country some of you may have seen a post that Trump put up on his social media
this is what he said quote he who saves his country does not
violate any law end of
quote in other words what that means in English is that Trump believes he can
can do anything he wants to do the law does not apply to
him and that is exactly how he has been
behaving in violation of the Constitution and federal law Trump
attempted to suspend all federal grants and
Loans he tried to block f funing for Medicaid Head Start food stamps homeless
veterans and so many other programs thankfully millions of people said you're not going to do it the courts
stop them for the [Applause]
moment he has eviscerated major agencies
like us [Music] Aid who are providing the help that the
poorest people in the world need to stay alive so the richest people in the world
are saying to the poorest people in the world the United States is not there for you that is a
disgrace they have eviscerated the consumer safety protection
board which has helped ordinary Americans gain billions and billions of
dollars from the illegal actions of Banks and corporations they have eviscerated the
National Labor Relations Board and what that means is that right
now where workers want to join unions if a union is organized tomorrow in Omaha
or Burlington Vermont and the company appeals that decision there ain't nobody
in Washington who can deal with that issue cuz we no longer have a functioning nlrb that means those
workers will not be able to join the
union but he's not only usurping the powers of congress he is also
challenging the authority of the federal court system and I don't know if any of
you have been listening to what vice president Vance has been saying
this is a guy who went to Yale law school who has concluded that the federal courts do not have authority to
stop a president from doing something
unconstitutional and I'll tell you what it's not only usurping the power of congress challenging the court system he
is doing what authoritarians all over the world do you go after the media they have sued ABC because they
didn't like a program they are suing meta they have sued meta which owns
Facebook and Instagram they are suing 60 minutes for a program they didn't
like they are suing the de Mo register because they did a poll that he didn't
like and now the cc is investigating PBS
and
NPR so what he is doing is not very hard to understand you're in the media work
for some small company you want to do a critical story on Trump and your boss is gonna say hey wait a minute we can't
afford to get sued these guys are going to sue us for a billion dollars ditch that story so they are
attacking the First Amendment and they are attacking the Constitution all over
the place and the other
thing the other reason that I am here this evening is not just our great fear
of oligarchy authoritarianism the big lie that comes out of Trump's mouth every
day but you didn't know this that Ukraine started the war
everybody in the world knows that Putin's start of the war except Donald
[Applause] Trump Donald Trump thinks climate change
is a hoax coming from China Trump thinks that January 6th
Insurrection was a Love Fest bunch of hippies spreading the
love but what we are dealing with is even more than that right now and one
of the reasons I am here is that the Republican leadership
if you can believe it is working on what they call in Washington a Reconciliation bill I not quite sure what that means
but it's a big Bill in Trump's idear it is a beautiful bill so if Trump thinks
it's a beautiful Bill watch out and
what I think somebody is leaning on a white A light switch there all
right and what this beautiful Bill
does which is one of the reasons I'm here in Omaha tonight it's not
complicated what it does does is give over a trillion dollars in tax breaks to
billionaires and the top 1% so you would think that at a time
when people like musk are worth 400 billion Bezos 250 billion Zuckerberg a mere 225
whatever it is you would think they would have enough but no no no they want
more so they want massive tax breaks and I'll tell you how those tax breaks are going
to be paid for they're going to be paid for by Savage cuts to programs that
Working Class People desperately
need at a time when our Health Care system is already
broken they want to make massive massive cuts to
Medicaid Medicaid provides health care to many many millions of children and
workingclass [Applause]
people what many people do not know is that Medicaid also provides a
substantial sum of money to help people who go into nursing
homes so we got a nursing home crisis in America you cut Medicaid they'll be a
lot of families that will not be able to send their parents into a nursing home
Medicaid provides substantial funding for community health centers cut
Medicaid community health centers which I have been very actively involved in expanding got 30 million people use
Community Health Cent cut Medicaid it's going to be hard for these community health centers to
provide the health care that people need so what we got right now is
Republican leadership as we speak are working on this bill massive
tax breaks for the rich paid for by cuts to Medicaid education housing and the
programs that working people need now it turns out that in the House of
Representatives there is right now a reality where Republicans have a very
very slim majority Republicans have as I recall
28 members Democrats have 215 they have a three vote majority that is not
much if two Republicans go to the speaker of the house and say Mr Mr
Speaker no way am I going to betray my constituents no way am I going to make
massive Cuts in Medicaid and other programs to give tax breaks to
[Applause]
billionaires if two Republicans do it that terrible bill is defeated
[Applause]
and what I am asking you to do is make sure that your Congressman Mr bacon is
one of those two [Applause]
Republicans and tomorrow I'll be bringing that same message so I will be bringing it all over the country we can
beat that [Applause]
bill and what I would appreciate all of you doing is to take out your
phones and go to Bernie sanders.com Nebraska
underline and there you will find the phone numbers of your senators and members of Congress
Congress and trust me I know a little bit about this these telephone calls
work because generally speaking members of Congress are just influenced by their
campaign contributors that's what the system is but if people at the Grassroots level wake up and say Hey you
better pay attention to us or you ain't going back to Washington they will
listen okay when you get on your phone you'll also find options to sign up to
attend organizing trainings or host meetings and House parties on this page
you can do it so that's Bernie sanders.com
Nebraska what I also o want to say tonight while we work hard to defeat
oligarchy and authoritarianism and some terrible
legislation that's not good enough that's playing defensive which we've got to do right now we also need to go on
the [Applause]
offensive and what I want to remind you of because it's it's easy to forget we
are not a poor country you know if we were a really poor country we'd be having a different type of discussion
we'd say well we're really poor we can't educate our kids we can't do healthare we can't do housing we are the richest
country in the history of the world there is nothing we cannot accomplish when we come
[Applause]
together and when we look to the future we must understand that Health Care is a
human right not a [Applause]
privilege and we have got to end the disgrace of being the only major country
on Earth not to guarantee Health Care to all people as a human right
in America millions of our people should not have to work two or three jobs at
starvation wages we've got to raise that minimum wage to a living wage at least
17 bucks an
hour and right now people all over this country are desperate to join
unions they know that if they can get if they want decent wages decent benefits
decent working conditions the way to do that is to join a
union and that is why we've got to pass What's called the proact to end the
illegal activities of companies making it difficult for workers to join
unions in the richest country on Earth our young people should not go deeply
into debt simply because they want a higher
education in the wealthiest country on Earth we should have the best educational system in the world from
Child Care to graduate school to vacational [Applause]
training moms and dads should not have to pay $25 ,000 a year for child
care young people should not have to go $50,000 in debt to get a college
education so instead of spending a trillion dollars a year on the military let's invest in our people make public
colleges and universities tuition free
we must address the housing crisis put lots of people to work at good union
jobs building the millions of units of low income and affordable housing that
we need and for the sake of our kids and
future Generations we must lead the world in Transforming Our Energy System
and combating climate change and create [Applause]
and we will not stand by and allow bigotry to show its ugly face in America
we're going to stand tall against all forms of
bigot we can do it what the system does and I deal with
the system every day their strategy is to tell you to tell Ordinary People you
are powerless nothing than you could do cuz musk and basos and all these guys
they got all the power don't even try we got the power you got nothing you work
for us that's all you can do but we know better we know we can win
we know we can take them on you know how we know that because we know a little bit about American history we know that
going back to the foundation to the founding of this country you had very brave people we learned this in the
fifth grade brave people who took on the entire British Empire to create a new
[Applause] country people said you can't do it how
the hell are you going to take on the British army the king of England can't do it they did it there was a demand early years of
this country where working people said you know what it should not only be wealthy white men who vote we want
universal suffrage you can't have that that's not what America is about only the rich vote people fought to bring
about universal suffrage everybody
votes people fought so that the 1920s women won the right to
vote you think taking on and defeating the slave owners of America was an easy
task it wasn't but people had the courage and died by the tens and tens of
thousands to end the horror of slavery people said it couldn't be done our heroes and heroins did
[Applause]
it and I must confess I am old enough to have been in Martin Luther King's speech
in Washington for jobs and freedom and people told King you cannot end
segregation in America but they did it when workers stood up in the early
part of the 20th century and said you know what we want a union and some of them got shut
down beaten up thrown into jail for wanting to have a union but work is W
back and won the right to join unions
when children little kids 8 n 10 years old were working in the fields and
factories Working Class People say we want those kids in schools not in the
factories we abolish childhood [Applause]
labor and for decades and decades women said we demand to control our own bodies
[Applause]
and women won we're fighting that fight today but women took on incredible power
to win that right and back in the 30s and 40s and 50s and 60s people said you
know you can't pass something like Social Security or Medicare or Medicade
you can't raise the minimum wage but working class people demanded that governments thought addressing those
issues and they succeeded so I tell you I tell you all
of those things and more I mean I can recall we can recall 1941 the United
States was attacked at Pearl HBA people said my God the country was unprepared
at the time got have to fight a war in the East fight Hitler in Europe how the
hell going to do that in two or three years that war was essentially won because the American people said we're
not going to allow fascism to take over the [Applause]
world so here we are today in another pivotal moment in American
history and I say to you with confidence with experience with some knowledge on this issue we can defeat them I know how
much money they have I know their ownership of the media I know that they can buy and sell politicians I know all
of that but just I also know that when we stand together and not let them
divide us up by the color of our skin or where we were born or our sexual orientation or our
religion when we stand together we can defeat them and we must defeat them
thank you all very [Applause]
much
