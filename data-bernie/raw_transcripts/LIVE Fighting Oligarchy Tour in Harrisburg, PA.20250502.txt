Harrisburg. What a fantastic turnout.
Thank you all very much for being here.
Let me thank Nate
Davidson, state representative. Let me
thank Maurice Cobb, Jim Anders, Angela
Fredo of the trade union movement right
here in
Pennsylvania. And let me thank
Congressman Chris Deluzio for the great
work that he's doing for workers all
over this country. Thank you, Chris.
You know, I
have been traveling this country
lately. We've been in the
Southwest. We've been in the Midwest.
We've been in
California. And we're here in the great
Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania. And we have talked to a
whole lot of folks, not just
Democrats. We've talked to Republicans
who have come out and I would not be
surprised that there are more than a few
Republicans here
tonight and we've talked to independents
as well and we've talked to people who
have kind of given up on the political
process and what we are hearing loudly
and clearly is the American people say
no to oligarchy.
Say no to
authoritarianism and say no to an
economy in which the rich are getting
richer while working people are
struggling.
And on that note, I want to say a word
to your Congressman, Representative
Scott Perry.
As some of you may
know, the Republican leadership in the
House and Senate are working on what is
called a reconciliation bill.
It's Trump's big, beautiful bill.
And what this big, beautiful bill will
do is cut over $800 billion in
Medicaid, cut nutrition programs for
hungry
kids, and cut educational
programs. And at a time of massive
income and wealth
inequality, what they propose to do with
those savings is to give over a trillion
dollar in tax breaks to the 1%.
Now, I am not in the habit of giving
political advice to
Republicans, but I would say this to
Representative Perry. If you vote for
tax breaks for billionaires and cut
Medicaid, you will not be returning to
Washington next term.
Now, what is happening right now all
across this country, we saw it in
Philadelphia yesterday, we're seeing it
all over America, is that people are
sick and tired of a handful of
billionaires running the United States
government.
And I want you to think about it for a
moment. Think about the richest man on
earth, Mr.
Musk
worth3400 billion dollars running all
over Washington
DC dismantling the Social Security
Administration so it's harder for older
disabled people to get the benefits they
paid into.
proposing to cut
83,000 jobs from the Veterans
Administration. I mean, that's hard to
believe. You got men and women who put
their lives on the line to defend our
country. There should be no
disagreement, Republican, Democrat,
independent, that those veterans deserve
the best care they can get.
So we say to Mr. Musk and his
billionaire friends, we are not going to
allow you to dismantle social security
or the
VA. And what I think there is also
profound discuss within again from the
right to the
left. Everybody understands that we have
a corrupt campaign finance
system. Now think about it for a moment.
Think about the fact that Mr. Musk
himself contributed
270 million dollars to get Trump elected
and
then and then for his
reward he becomes the most powerful
person in
government. But I want to be very clear
in stating this also.
This is not just a problem within the
Republican party. It's a problem within
the Democratic party as well.
I would say the overwhelming majority of
Americans, again, regardless of your
political
view, do not believe that billionaires
should be buying and selling
politicians.
And when we talk about
oligarchy, I want you to think back
three months or so ago when Trump was
inaugurated. And remember this scene I
was, ironically, I got kind of pushed
into the front
row. I got to walk to the said, "Bernie,
you're up front there." So, I had the
privilege about being as as close to
Trump as you guys are to
me. And sitting right behind Trump were
the three wealthiest people in America.
You remember
that? Mr. Musk, Mr. Bezos, and Mr.
Zuckerberg.
And then sitting right behind those guys
were another
13 billionaires who Trump had nominated
to head up major federal
agencies. Now, I think all of us
remember from our school days when we
learned about the Battle of Gettysburg
right here in
Pennsylvania. And it was a terrible
battle. And 20,000 Union soldiers either
died or were wounded on that
day fighting to help end slavery. And a
few days later, as you all
know, President Abraham Lincoln went to
the battlefield where just a few days
ago people had died. Horrible battle.
And he looked out on that
field and he said that our vision, so
many words, our vision for the future of
America is a government of the
people, by the people, for the people.
We will not
accept a government of the billionaire
class by the billionaire class for the
billionaire class.
But it is not just
oligarchy and the power of the
billionaire class that we are
fighting. We are today taking on a
president who in an unprecedented way is
undermining our constitution and
threatens our freedom of speech and
assembly.
A president whose agents are rounding up
innocent people right off of the
streets, throwing them into unmarked
vans and putting them in detention
centers in this country and abroad.
That is what happens in
dictatorships, not
democracies. And President Trump, we are
not going to allow you to create an
authoritarian society here in America.
But it is not just arresting people
without due process of putting them in
detention
centers. Trump, again, in an
unprecedented way, is suing
media for the crime of running stories
he doesn't like.
And right now, right now, and I want to
say this to CBS, the family, I don't
know how many of you know this, 60
Minutes did a story during the campaign
that Trump didn't
like. So, he decided to sue CBS and 60
Minutes for billions of dollars. And
they are thinking of reaching some kind
of settlement.
and they want to reach this settlement
because they are in the process the
family that owns Paramont that owns CBS
is in the process of trying to sell
Paramount to some other company and in
the way process they would make several
billion dollars. So I say to that
Redstone family do not sell out
democracy for a billion dollars.
President Trump is going after law
firms.
going after law firms whose lawyers
represented
clients that attacked him, went after
him or his
friends. And some of those law firms are
caving
in. So I say to those law
firms, your job is to protect the rule
of law, not sell out to an authoritarian
president.
Trump and his
administration are going after major
universities. And I want to applaud
Harvard University for having the guts
to stand up to them.
So, we got a lot to worry about in terms
of oligarchy and
authoritarianism and a rigged economy.
But it's not just domestic policy. It's
foreign policy as well. For the first
time in the
history of our
country, we have a president who is
cuddling up to a terrible dictator in
Russia, Vladimir
Putin. So I say, Mr. President, it was
not Ukraine that began this war. It was
Russia. And we're going to defend
democracy, not
dictatorship. But it is not just
Ukraine. Trump is continuing the
terrible policies of the Biden
administration in proposing billions
more for the Netanyahu war machine
against the people of Gaza.
Not only does he want $8 billion more in
military aid to continue the killing of
women and children in Gaza, they have an
idea that is so unbelievable that people
didn't originally take it seriously. And
their idea, as some of you may be
familiar with, is to
forcibly expel the suffering people of
Gaza so they could build a playground
for their billionaire friends. A
Riviera, Mr. Trump, we will never let
you get away with that.
And now I want to do something. I want
to do
something that we don't do very much in
Congress and the corporate media doesn't
do it as well. And that is to take a
real hard look at what's going on in our
country today in terms of working
families.
Today in America, as you may or may not
know, we have more income and wealth
inequality than we have ever had in the
history of our
country. If you can believe it, you got
one man, Mr. Musk, owning more wealth
than the bottom
53% of American households.
You got the top 1% now owning more
wealth than the bottom
93% of
Americans. You got CEOs now making
350 times what workers make.
And we don't talk about it much, but let
me tell you something as to why I
believe the American people are so
angry. Over the last 52 years, as all of
you know, there has been a huge increase
and an explosion in
technology and in worker productivity.
Every worker in America today is
producing much, much more than he or she
did 52 years ago. And yet, if you look
at inflation adjusted for weekly
income, the average American worker
today is earning less than she or he did
52 years ago.
And during that period, there has been a
massive trillion plus dollars transfer
of wealth from the bottom 90% to the top
1%. That is what's going on in America
today. very rich, becoming unbelievably
rich, while at the same time again hard
to believe in the richest country on
earth, 60% of our people are living
paycheck to
paycheck. I grew up in a family that
lived paycheck to paycheck. Many of you
are living paycheck to
paycheck. You all know what living
paycheck to paycheck is about.
What does it mean? You tell me.
Rents.
Oh, one at a time. Raise your hand.
Yeah,
ma'am. All right. Utilities, medical
bills. Right now, people all over this
country are seeing significant increases
in their
rent. All right? They're seeing
increases in their utility bills. And if
you're living paycheck to paycheck and
you got nothing in the bank, you're
living under great stress because you
can't pay those bills. What else we got?
Yes, ma'am. Food. All right.
You know, people are
increasingly increasingly want to make
sure that their kids eat well, not junk
food, eat decently. And yet it is harder
and harder when you walk into the
grocery store to pay for decent quality
food. Right. All right. And I go I go
grocery shopping in Burlington, Vermont,
and I see senior citizens looking at the
package, holding it up. How much does it
cost? Can they afford it? So, the
increased price of food is a growing
problem. What else you got, gentlemen
back there?
No, no, no. What?
What? Prescription
drugs in America
today. If you get sick, just talk to
somebody here in Harrisburg. If you get
sick, there is a 1 in4 chance you're not
going to be able to fill the
prescription your doctor
wrote. Because we pay the highest prices
in the world for prescription drugs so
that the drug companies can make
zillions of dollars in profit every
single
year. What else is on people's minds?
Yes, young lady. right there.
Education. Just talked to some kids
today. Love to go to college. Love to
get an apprenticeship program. I was in
one of your schools today. Beautiful
kids. And I sat and thought about these
kids, kids in Vermont, kids all over
this country who want to go out and
improve life in the country. We have
desperate needs in America in terms of
doctors, nurses, pharmacists,
dentists, electricians, plumbers, sheet
metal
workers, construction workers,
teachers. And yet, despite all of that
need, these kids are saying, "We don't
know if we can afford to get the
education that we need to do the work we
want to do and work that the country
desperately needs." All right, let me
just say this because I went through
this with my family and I see this every
day as Vermont senator and as I go
around the
country. In America today, millions and
millions of people are dealing with
incredible amounts of
stress. And that is one of the reasons
why in our country, not only do we have
a life
expectancy that is 4 years shorter than
people in other wealthy countries, but
for the working class of America, it is
7 years shorter than for the rich.
So here is the point and this is a point
that is very rarely made. If we were
living in a poor country, we would have
a certain type of discussion. I would
come before you and I would say, you
know, I'm a US senator. We're living in
a really poor country. I wish we could
provide healthcare. I wish we could
provide
education. I wish we could lower the
cost of prescription. We just can't do
it. We are a poor country.
But that is not the case. We are the
richest country in the history of the
world. Now what the establishment
does is they create a situation where
they tell you that politics is about a
horse race. Who's going to run for
president? Who's going to win? What kind
of dumb thing did Bernie Sanders or
somebody else
say? That ain't
politics. Real politics is taking a hard
look at where we are today and where we
want to go into the future.
And where we are
today is in an economy where the working
class of this country is struggling and
in many respects falling further and
further behind while the people on top
have never ever had it so good in the
history of the United States.
And our job is to get
smart to figure out why that is
happening and how we can turn it
around. And in these unprecedented
times, we've got to think in
unprecedented ways. So what so what I am
asking all of you, it's not Bernie. I'm
not going to do it for you. Delusio's
not going to do it for you. We have got
to do it
together. We got to get involved in the
political process in many many ways
because right now with a few exceptions,
what goes on is billionaires in both
parties determine who runs for office
determine what the agenda of those
candidates are. And our job right now is
to demand and make certain that the
agenda of the Democratic Party is the
agenda of the working class of this
country. And let me tell you a little
bit and it's important. You know, I deal
with politicians every day and people
can give you wonderful speeches. They
are dramatic. They're loud. They're
witty, but they don't say
anything. And your job is to make sure
they do say what's relevant. Let me give
you just a few examples. Number one,
we're going to go nowhere as a nation
unless we get rid of this
disastrous campaign finance
system. So when somebody comes before
you, somebody comes before you and they
say, "I want your vote. I want your
vote." You ask them, "Are you going to
get rid of this terrible undemocratic
Citizens United Supreme Court decision
and and move to public funding of
elections at a time when the rich are
getting richer and major American
corporations pay almost nothing? Some of
them pay almost nothing in federal
taxes. Why don't you ask them if they
are prepared at a time of unprecedented
income and wealth inequality to demand
to pass legislation telling the rich and
large corporations they are finally
going to start paying their fair share
of taxes?
All over this country, workers want to
join
unions. And they want to join unions
because they know that when you're in a
union, you're going to get better wages,
better working conditions, better
benefits. But right now, large
corporations acting illegally are
preventing workers from creating unions.
Ask the candidates in front of you
whether they support what's called the
PRO Act to end illegal corporate
intimidation of workers who want to join
union. In America today, here in
Pennsylvania and all over this country,
we got millions of workers earning
starvation
wages. Nobody anywhere in America can
make it on 7 and a4 an
hour, not on $10 an hour, not on $13 an
hour.
in Washington and here in Pennsylvania.
We've got to raise the minimum wage to a
living
wage. And I've introduced legislation to
raise it to at least
$17 an hour.
And here is an issue that some may think
is controversial. I don't. And some of
the unions are now raising
it. All of you have noticed that Musk
and his friends have fired thousands and
thousands of federal
employees. Now, think for a moment.
These employees, federal government
employees, many of them union members,
get fired overnight. What do you think
Musk and his oligarch friends will do
when artificial intelligence and
robotics comes for your
job? Do you think they're going to say,
"Oh, well, we're going to work out
something for you." They're going to
throw you right out on the street.
That's what they'll do if we let them.
So right now at a time when
workers are producing much more, worker
productivity is increasing, we should be
thinking about a
32hour work week with no loss of pay.
Technology should benefit workers, not
just the large corporations who own that
technology. We need the best educated
workforce in the
world. And that is why our kids should
have the opportunity to live out their
dreams, to get the training they need,
the higher education they
need. 120 years ago, very brave people
around the country, I think it started
in Wisconsin, demanded free public
education for their kids.
And for all that period of time, free
public education meant K through
12. God didn't create K through 12. The
world is changing. Kids need more
education. Let us make public colleges
and universities tuitionfree.
And by the
way, And by the way, if we are going to
have the best public education system in
the world, we need to pay teachers the
value of what they're worth.
And I've introduced legislation to make
certain that no teacher in America
starts off at less than
$60,000 a year.
Many of you don't know this because it's
not talked about, but
22% of senior citizens in America are
living on
$15,000 a year or less. Got
that? Can you imagine anybody, let alone
a senior, living on $15,000 or less?
And in the midst of that, you got some
Republicans who are saying they want to
cut Social
Security. Well, we're not going to let
them cut Social Security. What we are
going to do is expand Social Security
benefits. And we do that by lifting the
cap on taxable income.
You know, I get around the world a bit
and just the other night, last week, I
had a very nice dinner with the
ambassadors from Denmark, Norway,
Sweden, and Finland. And we chatted and
I said, "Just out of curiosity, how much
does it cost to go to a doctor in one of
your countries?" and they looked at me
like I was a little bit
crazy. Of course, in those countries, in
many countries around the
world, healthc care is seen as a human
right, not a
privilege. It is an absolute disgrace.
an absolute disgrace and a failure of
our corrupt political system that we
remain the only major country on earth
not to guarantee healthcare to every
man, woman, and
child right now. If you can believe it,
again, I keep saying if you can believe
it because these things are so
outrageous. We have 85 million Americans
uninsured or underinsured. Many of you
have high deductibles. Am I right? All
right. And by the way, people in other
countries don't even know what the
concept of deductible is. The idea that
you have insurance, but you got to pay
the first $5, $10,000 out of your own
pocket is literally crazy.
All
right. So, we got 85 million uninsured
or
underinsured. We have 68,000 people
dying every year. You know why they're
dying? Because they can't afford to go
to a doctor when they
should talk to doctors. I do in Vermont,
around the country, and they will tell
you patients walk in much sicker than
they should be. Brothers and
sisters, healthc care belongs to all,
rich and poor, young and
old. And that is why I have introduced
reintroduced with 15 co-sponsors in the
Senate Medicare for all singlepayer
program.
Donald Trump thinks that climate change
is a
hoax. He is very dangerously wrong.
And we can create millions of goodaying
union jobs. Transforming our energy
system away from fossil fuel to energy
efficiency and sustainable
energy in Harrisburg and in Burlington,
Vermont and in many parts of this
country. We have a major housing crisis.
You got 800,000 people who are homeless
in our country. You got 20 million
people who are spending 50% or more of
their limited incomes on
housing. In my view, we should cut the
trillion dollars in military spending
and invest that in building lowincome
and affordable housing.
So brothers and sisters, these are some
of the issues that we've got to deal
with. And I want to reiterate once again
what the system, what the establishment,
what the
media, what politicians do is
essentially tell you you are
powerless. The oligarchs have all the
power. They own the media. They own the
political system. They own the economy.
and they tell you nothing you can do
about it. Well, I'm here tonight to tell
you that there's a hell of a lot you can
do about
it. I'm here tonight to tell you there
is no rational
reason why we are behind so many other
countries in terms of health care, in
terms of housing. We have the highest
rate of childhood poverty of almost any
major country. Highest rate of senior
poverty of almost any major country.
More income and wealth inequality than
almost any other
country. Brothers and
sisters, this is an unprecedented moment
in American history. No question about
it. But what I
believe in my
heart is that while these guys have all
of the power and they have unlimited
sums of money, if we stand together and
not allow Trump and his friends do what
demagogues always do, how do they stay
in power?
They divide us by the color of our skin
or where we were born or our sexual
orientation. They get us to hate each
other.
But if we stand
together and demand a government and an
economy that works for all, not just a
few. If we understand that at the end of
the day, 99% is a hell of a larger
number than 1%.
If we have the courage to go outside of
our zones of comfort, talk to other
people, talk to your Republican friends.
They don't think that billionaires
should get tax breaks. They don't think
that Musk should be destroying Social
Security. So, let us stand together. Let
us defeat oligarchy. Let us defeat
authoritarianism and create a government
and economy that works for all of us,
not just a few. Thank you all very much.
This world that I found is too good to
be true. Standing here beside you. long
so much to give you this love in my
heart that I'm feeling for
you. See, we're
crazy. I don't care about that. Put your
hands in my hand,
baby. The world around us just fall.
We're hard to
