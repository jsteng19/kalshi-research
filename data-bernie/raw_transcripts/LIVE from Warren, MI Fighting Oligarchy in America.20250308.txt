whoa I want to thank for that in tell you that in you have one of the
great Progressive Trade union leaders in
America so brothers and sisters we got some problems in this
country we have a an
Administration that is leading us to
oligarchy and an Administration that is leading us to an authoritarian form of
[Music] [Applause] society and an Administration that is
leading us toward kleptocracy
and what I see happening and I was just in Kenosha yesterday we were in Altuna
Wisconsin earlier today I see this incredible TR you know how many people we have here we got a bunch of rooms we
got over 6,000
people so what I see happening All Over America is people not just Democrats or
Independents but Republicans as well saying we fought for too long and too
many people died for democracy we're not going to
diarchy you know it's a funny thing that we are right here in Abraham Lincoln
high school and I thank the high school for
allowing us to use their facilities so I want to tell you a little story uh in
Vermont on Memorial Day I usually go to a parade a beautiful parade one of the largest in the state in a uh town called
viren's Vermont in the northern part of the state and at the end of the parade people assemble at the Town green and
people give speeches and the organizers always bring up some kids from the high school to say a few words and what they
asked the kids from the high school uh to say one of the speeches is to recite
Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address you all remember that and let me remind you what he said
because it was really preent and it was really quite extraordinary here he was in
1863 I think it was a few days after the terrible Battle of Gettysburg found
thousands and thousands maybe tens of thousands of soldiers had died in the fight against slavery and he looks out
he looks out on that field and this is what he says and you'll all remember this he said that we he highly resolve
that these dead shall not have died in vain that this nation un God shall have
a new birth of freedom and and that government of the
People by the people for the people
shall not perish from the [Applause]
earth and that is why we are here today
we're here today to in fact make sure that after so many people in our country
have fought who fought and died for democracy that we are going to be stay a
government of the People by the people and for the [Applause]
people and I want to tell you what we are up against because you got to know
what this struggle is about and I think you all do and I want you to think back just six or so weeks ago when Donald
Trump was Ina [Music] inaugurated now think about who the
people were now I had a box seat for whatever reason I got pushed to the front of that
so I like three feet away and right behind Trump sitting behind them were the three wealthiest
people in America Mr musk Mr Bezos and Mr
Zuckerberg that's not all behind them were 13 other
billionaires who Trump had nominated to head major government
agencies in other words they weren't hiding anything they were telling the American
people and the world that instead of a government of the People by the people and for the people we have now become a
government of the billionaire class for the billionaire class and buy the billionaire
[Applause] class that is what brothers and sisters
we are taking on and I want to say something that I
really fully do not understand maybe we have some psychiatrists in the audience and I mean
that seriously who can help us here cuz look everybody wants to make money everybody wants to live comfortably
nothing new about that in this country today in Vermont breaks my heart and I'm
sure in Michigan we have major addiction problems right we all know
people who are addicted to drugs and what's happening to their lives we know
people who are alcoholic we know people who smoke too much people who are you know overweight eat too much people who
have addictions but I will tell you what the most serious addiction is in this
country boy it's a smart group of people that's right it is the addiction of greed by
the billionaire class now you might think that if
somebody had a few hundred million had their own Jet Plane had
their own island or whatever these these guys do it might be enough but it is
never enough they are addicted to more and more and more and they don't care
how many people they step over in order to satisfy their
greed and right now what they are in the process of trying to do and it's why I'm
here in Warren to stop them what they want to do is that time when we have
more income and wealth inequality than we have ever had when the billionaire
class the people on top have never ever ever had it so good what they want to do
is give over a trillion dollars in tax rates to the 1% and they do that by cutting $880
billion from Medicaid over $200 billion from nutrition and other programs that
the working last of this [Applause] country so in other words this is the
Robin Hood proposal in Reverse instead of taking from the rich giv to the poor
they're taking from the poor and giving them to the rich we ain't going to let that
happen and I want to explain for a moment what $880 billion in Medicaid
means it means that when in the midst of a health care crisis millions of children will be
thrown off of the health insurance they have if you have a mom or a dad in a
nursing home or somebody who may need nursing home understand that two out of
three people in nursing homes get there through Medicaid payments cut Medicaid
going to be harder to get people into nursing homes quality of care will
deteriorate we have 32 million people in community getting their Health Care at
community health centers something that I work very hard on Primary Healthcare
40% of the revenue for community health centers comes from Medicaid SL Medicaid
it'll be harder for millions of people get the primary care the dental care The Vision Care that they need we
are not going to allow them to slash Medicaid in order to give tax rates to the rich
now the reason we are in Warren and we're in kosha and we're in Altuna is
that all of these congressional districts have Republican members of Congress who won by a very slim
[Applause] vote your congressman is Mr James John
James [Applause] apparently you know Mr
James so my request of Mr James James is very simple you know I'm from Vermont
and I am here doing a town meeting in Warren
Michigan Mr James I think your constituents here in Warren would love
to do a town meeting with you
and I think that town meeting should be respectful people he has the right to
make his case let him speak you have the right to ask him questions and I think
the question that is most on people's minds is why would any member of
Congress vote for massive tax breaks for billionaires and then cut Medicaid
education and Nutri [Applause]
[Music] [Applause] but Mr
musk and Mr Trump are not only going after Medicaid and nutrition programs
they're going after Social
Security I think I speak for every member of the Senate I'm telling you that we get calls every single day from
Seniors people with disability say I'm trying to reach Social Security I got a problem I want to talk to somebody it's
taken forever to do that in fact shamefully some 30,000 people die every year waiting for
an understaffed Social Security they are way under staff today to approve
disability benefits you got that so people are sick they're on disability
takes them forever to get their issue dealt with and they die in between what
musk and Trump are proposing are massive cuts to Social Security Staffing which
would make it harder for people to get their claims addressed that would mean
more people will die that is not acceptable
[Applause]
[Music] [Applause] and I'll tell you what else they are trying to do I one of the honors of my Senate life
was I chaired for a while the US Senate committee on Veterans
Affairs and I'm very proud of that and I have the opportunity to meet people great veterans not only from Vermont but
all over the country and I think no matter what your political view may be I
think there is nobody or very few people in America who would disagree that when a man or a woman puts their lives on the
line to defend us we honor our commitments to those veterans
[Music]
but at the behest of Mr musk the VA has announced that they intend to lay off
[Music] 83,000 employees at the
veterans and that will mean for veterans to go into VA Health Care a a
deterioration and the quality of care they get for veterans are waiting for their benefits it will take them longer
to get now just yesterday Foreign Wars the second largest veterans organization
in the country said quote We Now call upon VA to reconsider its planned
reduction of 83,000 employees the VFW is right I call
on the Trump Administration resend that [Applause]
order we are not going to balance the budget on the backs of our veterans or our
seniors I'll tell you something else in their proposal the Republican
proposal not only they have 880 billion in cuts for Medicaid they have $230 billion in cuts to nutrition
programs now you tell me in what Universe in what world in what religion
is it acceptable to give tax breaks to the C to the very richest people and cut
food programs for Hungry
kids that is disgusting and grossly
[Applause]
immoral obviously one of the ways you dismantle programs is you cut Staffing
you cut massive amounts of workers at Social Security of va they can't deliver
the services that people need so right now they are in Trump and musk are in
the process of laying off hundreds of thousands of federal employees and put
yourself we have any federal employees right here yeah all right and we thank
them for their service
and I can tell you that and it's not hard to imagine you're a federal employee to everyone's on pins and
needles they're wondering they're going to get a letter from Mr musk tomorrow telling them that they're gone people have worked for years people have done
great work gone out on the streets now I want you to think for a moment if Mr musk can do this
arbitrarily fire hundreds of thousands of federal employees think about what
will happen when the re technological revolution of artificial intelligence
and Robotics really gets hold in this country think about it everybody knows
that this revolution is coming and that means that many millions of workers in the private sector are going to be
displaced if musk can simply throw out onto the street for no decent reason
hundreds of thousands of federal employees what do you think they're going to do when Robotics and artificial
intelligence comes they're going to replace those workers and they're going to throw them out on the street as
well this is a Prelude to what they're going to do in the private sector now I
happen to believe that technology unto itself is not a bad thing if it can
result in increased worker productivity that's great but what we want to make
sure is that workers benefit from that worker productivity
[Applause]
[Music] [Applause] increase we going watch CEOs all over
this country say hey we got a machine to replace you we don't need you any any more you're out on the
street now what we are up against is not only
the Incredible greed of the billionaire class we're up against something that we really have
never experienced in this country and I'm not going to stand up here and tell you with a straight face that
politicians Never Lie never stretch the truth a little bit
occasionally that happens but what we're up against right now and this is enormously important
because we're up against a phenomenon that we have never seen and that is the big
lie the big lie is not just stretching the truth big lie is not just
fibbing the big lie is creating a parallel
universe a set of ideas that either have no basis in reality or in the great
scheme of things are nowhere near the most important concerns that the American people have what some of these
people on the right are doing is saying outrageously false statements they say
it over and over again and then they have the right-wing social media blast
it out to hundreds of Millions of people until people actually believe it and
then and then rather than having the kinds of discussions and debate that we
should have in a Democratic Society what are the issues you have your view I have my view let's debate let's come up to
some consensus or we'll vote on it whatever it may be we spend half our lives trying to refute outrageous lies
let me just give you a few examples which you're familiar with Trump claimed
that the 2020 election was stolen from [Applause]
him and that he won by a landslide a
lie all of you remember that terrible January 6th Insurrection where they
tried to prevent well Trump claimed that that was a day of love and by the way pardon all
of those insurrectionists
Trump has claimed that millions and millions of
undocumented people vote in American elections a
lie Trump has claimed that climate change is a hoax originating in China
AE and very recently Trump has claimed that Ukraine started the horrific war
with Russia and I give you an idea how bad this is a
couple of months ago and I was involved in this there was there was what we would call we call in Washington A
continuing resolution a CR keep the government going and people Democrats and Republicans work together four
months and we had I was chairman of the health education committee a lot of Provisions in there which would have cut
the cost of prescription drugs would have expanded Healthcare etc etc we were involved in that debate anyhow months
and months of discussion debate arguments finally an agreement was reached literally the day before that
was going to be voted on and passed in the house Mr musk sent out e on Twitter
emails that said there was a 43% increase in salaries for members of
Congress tell your member of Congress not to vote for it they're going to get a 43% increase a total
lie it was a 3.4 inflation that's all it was percent increase total Li and as a
result of what musk did and the emails that he sent out the Republicans refused
to go forward and that bill died and it doesn't stop if some of you
have heard Trump's State of the Union speech he claimed he picked up on something that musk had started and that
as you all heard Millions zillions of people who were 200 150 years of age 500
years of age they're all receiving Social Security benefits all right I got two
questions why would he do that what is the think think no what is if you say to
people the arage American you know that social security system is really corrupt you got all these people there 200 100
years of age they're getting it's all corrupt what is the goal all right I can raise one ver raise
I can't hear anybody yeah it's right yes
sir yes what else you got
yep that's right all right all of this stuff is to tell you give up on your
government government can't do anything it's all fraud Social Security is broken
it's fraudulent Medicare Medicaid it's all and if you do that what is the end
result the privatization of everything you're going to give all this stuff over to large
corporations so the truth is the truth is that well over
99% of Social Security checks are going out to the people who earned those
checks [Applause]
70 million people and nobody who is
150 or 200 gets a social security check
absolute lie now the now the purpose of all this
lying is not just to put P his right-wing ideology it's more than that it is and
this is big stuff that we got to stay on what they are trying to do is deflect attention away from the real issues the
very serious issues that the working class of this country is facing and those are issues that musk and Trump do
not want to address because it's not in their financial interests to do so so as
a case in point Trump gave his State of the Union speech it went on
[Music] for about 28 hours I don't
know it was a longest State of the Union I think it was 100 minutes and in his
100 this is what is extraordinary it's not what he said it's what he didn't say
he spoke for over an hour and a half and he almost completely ignored the issues
that are keeping Working Families up at night as they worry about how they are
going to survive in these very difficult times so let's do something radical you
ready to do something radical
let's do what president Trump did not do let us take a real look at what is going
on in America today okay all right we are the richest country we are the
richest country in the history of the world but you know what
60% 6% of our people are living paycheck to
paycheck now unlike Trump I grew up in a family that lived paycheck to paycheck
and I know a little bit about that as I expect many of you
do so what does living paycheck to paycheck mean tell me raise your hands
and be loud yes right here it means surviving how you survive yes it means
little money what is it yes stress hold it one at time yeah
survival exha exhaustion fear fear of what a fear of
everything what medical care yes
ma'am no money for emergencies yes making difficult choices
ma'am okay all all right any right there yeah no F no future all right here is here is
the reality and I think you've all said it in in a few
minutes millions of Americans today are wondering how they're going to
be able to pay their rent and what happens if the landlord
raises their rent what do they do where you rents are going up all over the what do you do with the landlord raises your
rent you got to move where you going to move to you got to take your kid out out of school where's going to go she's going to go people are worried that your
child or your parent becomes sick you can't afford to take that person to a
doctor or you cannot afford the prescription drugs that your mom or your kid may
need what's going on today in America is people are worried just something as
simple as basic your car breaks down you got an old car right your car breaks
down and the guy at the repair shop says it's could to cost you a th000 bucks to get it fixed now what happens if you
don't have the th000 Bucks you can't get your car fixed if you can't get your car fix you can't get
to work if you can't get to work you're going to lose your job if you lose your job how you going to survive that's
because millions of people don't have $1,000 in the
bank in America today and this is a remarkable remarkable fact it it's not
just that our life expectancy you all know what life expect how long we live
it's about four years shorter than people in other wealthy countries and we should wonder why that
is so but here's something that is never talked about now I want to throw that
out to you I want you to digest it if you are working class in this country
your life expectancy on average will be seven years shorter than if you are
[Applause] wealthy do you all understand what that is about that
means that being working class in this country in many respects is like a death
sentence you're rich you're going to live long life you're working class seven years short why is
that a stress all right what stress is about stress is not
some concept oh we're stressed out stress is a physiological reaction yes
and there is you know doctors frame it as as the the uh it's the disease of of
poor people who have to struggle every single day stress wrecks your body and
it has a terrible impact on your mind if you have to worry every single day how
you going to survive how do I feed the kids how do I pay the rent what happens if I get a call that I have
to be at work at midnight for the midnight shift you add all that together people are living on pins and needles
day after day year after year stress
kills and in the richest country in the history of the world millions of people
should not have shorter lives than they otherwise should because of the economy
that we have [Music]
[Applause]
but it's not just domestic policy that we have got to be concerned about under
Trump we are all proud I think we wake up in the morning we know it it's part of who we are as Americans we are proud
that we are the longest standing democracy in the
world you know and we are proud We are proud and I
mean this sincerely that all over the world people read our Declaration of
Independence they read the Constitution and they say you know what that's what we want our country to be like a country
that is free a country that is
democratic but I have to tell you that for the first time in our
250e history we have a president who is turning his back on democracy and
allying allying us with
authoritarianism no Mr president Ukraine did not start this war
[Music] no Mr President zinski is not a dictator
Vladimir Putin [Applause]
is we must not abandon the people of Ukraine who were invaded by
Putin this country must stand for democracy not
dictatorship and there is another issue that I have worked long and hard on and
that is as all of you know there was a terrible attack by Kamas against Israel
1,00 innocent people were killed Israel had a right to respond but Israel did
not have the right to wage an allout war against the Palestinian people
[Applause]
and as a result of that all out War
45,000 people most of whom most of whom are women and children
are dead and as a result of that war well over 100,000 have been injured and
as a result both of that war the infrastructure the health care the schools the Water Systems the Wastewater
plants in Gaza have been virtually destroyed now
tragically Trump wants to follow Biden's very mistaken policy and provide more
weapons to netanyahu's right-wing extremist
[Applause] government I'm going to do everything in my power to make sure that Netanyahu
does not get those [Applause] [Music]
arms and while we have got to be very Vigilant every day as to what Trump and
musk and these guys are doing and fight back that is not good enough it's not good enough just to be on the defense we
have got to play offense as well
and here is a secret that the corporate media will not tell you and that is the
progressive agenda is wildly popular all over this
country it is exactly what the American people
want and at the top of the list whether you're Democrat Republican independent
you know that we have a corrupt campaign Finance
[Applause] system this is America billionaires
should not be allowed to buy
politicians it is beyond insane Beyond insane that musque was
able to contribute $270 million to Trump's campaign and
then his reward he becomes the most powerful person in the
government but it is not just musk it is not just musk and Republicans it is
democratic billionaires as well
[Music] we
need we need to end this disastrous and corrupt campaign Finance
system we need to overturn the citizens united
decision and we need to move to Public Funding of
Elections billiones should no longer be able to buy
elections and I'll tell you something else like the American people Democrats Republicans Independents feel strongly
about at a time of unprecedented income and wealth inequality they don't want
the billionaire class to get another nickel in tax [Applause]
breaks when many millions of our people are trying to survive on starvation
wages the American people understand we've got to raise at federal minimum wage
today today an abysal 7 and A4 an hour to a living wage at least 15 17 bucks an
[Applause] hour all over America we got any trade
unionist here people in unions raise hand all right thank
you all over this country workers know that if you're can earn decent wages
benefits and working conditions you got to have a union at your
back unions have never been more popular than they are right
now but what's going on is that many of these corporations are acting illegally
in trying to prevent workers from joining a union they're threatening them they're threatening to move the the
plant to China taking them in back rooms and doctrina them all of which is illegal that is why we've got to pass
legislation I just reintroduced called the proa that punishes companies that
act illegally when workers on a Bor the [Applause] [Music]
union if you can believe it hard to believe but it is true
22% of seniors in America are trying to survive on 15 ,000 a year or
less half of seniors trying to get by on 30,000 or less no Mr Trump we ain't
going to cut Social Security we're going to expand Social Security [Applause]
[Music] benefits how many people in this room
think our current health care system is working you're right
we are spending twice as much for personal on Healthcare as the people of any other country yeah we got 85 million
uninsured or under insured many of you have large deductibles right all
right we have 60,000 people a year in America dying because they can't get to
a doctor on time all right they get sick they wait they wait they walk to the doctor's office it is too late the time
is long overdue for this country to do what every other major country does
guarantee Health Care all people as a human [Applause]
right I need your help we're going to reintroduce Medicare for all let's get
it past
unbelievably in our broken Health Care system one out of four people who get a
prescription from their doctor cannot afford to fill that
prescription we pay by far the highest prices in the world for prescription
drugs sometimes 10 times more than people in other
countries Congress has got to have the guts to take on big farma and make sure
that we cut prescription drug cost in this country by
50% and here's another concept which is not radical it already exists around the
world it is common sense we live in a competitive global economy we need the
best educated Workforce in the world
[Music] it's not just that we need more doctors and nurses and dentists we need more
cooperativ and electricians and Sheet Metal Workers we need more
teachers it is totally insane that when we have a desperate need for skilled
workers educated workers that young people are going 30 50 $100,000 or more
in to get an education instead of giving tax breaks
to billionaires let's make public colleges and universities tuition
[Applause]
free and despite what Mr Trump may think climate change sadly is not a hoax it is
an existential threat we can create millions of good paying un jobs by
Transforming Our Energy System into Energy Efficiency and sustainable
energy and by the way by the way when we talk about
freedom and I hear that word a lot in Washington DC you know what Freedom means it means that every woman in this
country should have the right to control her own body
now I know I know that a lot of folks
throughout the country here in Michigan are feeling angry you're feeling frustrated and some of you may feel a
bit hopeless so let me say this at this moment in history this very difficult
moment despair is not an [Applause]
option giving up is not
acceptable that is what the oligarchs want you to do
[Music] so let us never
forget real change the change that we have experienced over the hundreds of years of our nationhood only occurs when
ordinary people stand up against oppression and Injustice and fight back
that's how change change does not take place from
the top on down it's the bottom on up and I want you to think in this
difficult moment to understand that this is not the first time in American
history that we have faced serious serious challenges and I want you and I don't want to be overly romantic here
but I want you to think back to the 1760s 1770s where you had these people
here in the colonies then colonies and they said you know what we want independence we want to be able to make
our own decisions and they stood up to the entire British Empire the king of
England the most powerful guy on Earth and you know what they beat [Applause]
him I want you to think about the 1830s 1840s 1850s people in the Abolitionist
Movement who said you know what slavery must be abolished once and for all from
this country
and they were take on some very powerful people and we were engaged in a horrible
bloody Civil War but we prevailed slavery was
abolished Sean Sean Fain of the UAW was up here a few minutes ago and I was just
thinking I was reading something today about the labor movement all of you know know anything about Labor history but in
the early parts of the 20th century you know we had kids little children working
in factories we had workers working seven days a week we had workers who are
paid horrible wages and what workers said said you know what we want to form
a union and what the companies would often do is fire these workers they
would have workers beaten up sometimes they were work were killed because they wanted to form a union I was just
reading today I don't know how many of you know this that in uh
1936 when people were forming the United Automobile workers workers faced
enormous opposition from General Motors and the other big automobile companies you know what workers did they actually
took over GM's [Applause]
factories they waged a sit in and as a result of that the UAW was
formed result of that other great unions were formed and the unions helped create the American middle class they struggled
and they won and we all remember we read about
the extraordinary bravery of Dr King and the civil rights movement and their struggle against
segregation we all know the history of the women's
movement women fored and died for the right to vote for the right
to control their own bodies it was not an easy struggle and we got the
environmental movement and the gay rights movement in other words in other words nobody Frederick
dougas said that nobody ever gives you Freedom you got to fight for
[Music] it so yes the oligarchs are enormously
powerful they have endless amounts of money they control our economy they own
much of the media and they have enormous influence over our political system
but from the bottom of my heart I believe that if we stand together we can
beat [Applause]
them you know Nelson Mandela made a very profound statement
he said everything is impossible until it is
done so you know like oh my God can't happen to Camp been it happen oh no big
deal you know yeah well all right so well well I love you
too so what I want you all to appreciate I want you all to
appreciate that in the wealthiest country in the history of the world if
we stand together if we do not let the rightwing Divide us up by the color of
our skin or where we were born or our religion or our sexual orientation if we
stand together fighting for an agenda that works for the working class of this
country nothing can stop us
no no no no no no no it's not Bernie it is
you I'll do my job but you've got to do your job I've just been informed by a
staff member that right here in Warren Michigan today we have over
9,000 people have attended this
event so I think in addition to this room we got an overflow room and then we got an overflow overflow
room and what that tells me is the people not only in Michigan in Vermont
but all over this country we're prepared to stand up we're prepared to fight and we're going to win thank
[Applause]
you
e e
