[Applause] Madison and let me let me thank
Alexandria not only for that lovely
introduction but for the extraordinary work she is doing all over this country she is an inspiring an entire generation
of [Applause] Americans and let me thank you for
sending Mark pan to the United States
house and while I'm at it let me beg of you return Tammy Baldwin to the US
Senate [Applause]
now it's hard to follow Mark and Alexandria but let me just say this this
is a close election and given our crazy political
system what happens in the state of Vermont doesn't matter because Trump is going to lose Vermont by 30
[Applause] points what happens in Wyoming doesn't
matter cuz Trump is going to win there by 30
points so the what happens in 50 states doesn't really matter what happens in 10
states does matter and what happens in Wisconsin matters very very
much so we have filled this place up we got a thousand or more people here and
in a state where this election could be decided by a handful of votes if each
and every person here brought out two or three more people to the polling booths
you could make the difference in terms of what happens in Wisconsin Wisconsin can make the difference in terms of what
happens in America and what America does changes the world [Applause]
so you got a little bit of responsibility on your shoulders and that means in the next
week do everything you can to make sure that KLA Harris is the next president of
the United
States now I don't want to spend tonight a whole lot of time on Donald Trump because he is not worth a whole
lot of time but I think what is really important and
quite interesting in this crazy election is that for the first time I think ever
you have somebody who is running for president and you have his former vice
president Mike Pence a an extremely Conservative
Republican you have Mike Pence saying I cannot support the guy I work with for
four years can't support him you have John Kelly his chief of
staff who says you know I know Donald Trump I've been in closed
door meetings with Donald Trump I know what he wants to do to this country and
I cannot support Donald Trump you have Mitt Romney he's on my committee
Conservative Republican disagree with him on everything but he has moral and
religious Valu and Mitt Romney is not supporting Romney who was the Republican
candidate for president of the United States and you got many others so the
point is not that I or Alexandria agree with these guys on virtually anything
but they do have the decency and the sense to understand that we cannot allow
somebody to be president of the United States who is a pathological liar
and who is working night and day to undermine American
[Applause]
democracy want to talk a little bit about what commer is going to do
when she began her campaign the very first thing that she
said was that as I go around the country I see a major housing crisis and it's
not just homelessness what it is is that we are seeing people paying 50 or 60% of their
limited incomes for housing not acceptable let's build 3 million units
of affordable [Applause]
housing Let's Take on the corporate landlords who are ripping off their
tenants every single today let's make it easier for Working
Class People to own their own
homes and KLA understands something that everybody in this room should understand
that it is an absolute disgrace that in America we have the highest rate of
childhood Poverty of almost any major country on Earth and whater is proposing
what she is proposing is a permanent extension of the child tax credit which
will lower childhood poverty by at least 40% in this
country what KLA understands as they all over America you have elderly folks and
people with disabilities who want to stay in their own homes
but are being forced to go into nursing homes because they cannot afford the
help they need to stay at home and that is why and that is why in a very
significant step forward where KLA is saying we got to expand Medicare to
cover home health [Applause]
care and H understands shamefully because we're the
only major country on Earth not to guarantee healthare to all people she understands there are millions of seniors can't afford heygates can't
afford eyeglasses we're going to expand Medicare to cover those as
[Applause] well you know some of you some of you
may have noticed it was a couple of weeks ago Donald Trump had an honest
15minute of work in McDonald's finally did some honest
work and he goes to McDonald's he does his photo opportunity which is fine everybody has a photo opportunity and
then the reporter says to them well you know you were here at McDonald's how do you feel about raising the minimum
wage and with Trump oh I love McDonald's workers they're great people I love how
you feel about raising the minimum oh I love McDonald's workers he didn't answer the question he duck the question and
the reason he duck the question is that at a time when we have 20 million
workers in America earning less than 15 bucks an hour Donald Trump and his
friends do not want to raise the minimum wage above the $725 an hour it currently
is now how Bloody disgraceful is it that you have a so-called billionaire Trump
and a zillionaire Elon musk running around the country and they will not
give a pay raise to millions of workers KLA Harris understands that the 725
minimum wage is an absolute disgrace it's got to be raised to a living wage
at least 15 bucks an [Applause]
hour one of the exciting developments that has occurred in the
last couple years years and I know Alexandria's been involved Mark's been involved I've been involved in it we are
seeing a significant expansion of the Trade union movement in
[Applause] America and as somebody who grew up in a
working class home lived in a rent controlled apartment I know why and that
is that the working people of MTH America are sick and tired of the Corp
greed they are seeing every single [Applause]
day so not only are we seeing great unions taking on that corporate greed
and saying to the CEOs of these large corporations you are making tens of
millions of dollars a year you know what you're going to pay our workers a decent wage and give us decent benefits
[Applause] but while workers All Over America are
trying to form unions the corporate world also understands what's going on
they are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to break unions to engage in
union busting the firew workers who are trying to organize the threatened workers are going to move to China if
the shop becomes organized the firew workers who have been involved in organizing efforts to take them into the
back room and brainwash them about you know anti-union
propaganda there is legislation that I am supporting which says that those
corporations who engage in illegal and all of that stuff is illegal in illegal
anti-union activity are going to be fined in a very serious way
and because kamla understands that we got to grow the Trade union movement
that one of the only ways the workers are get decent wages decent benefits decent retirement is through a growth in
the Trade union movement she supports the
proact and Donald Trump does not we have made in recent years under
Biden and Harris some progress not enough some progress in lowering the
outrageously High Cost of prescription drugs in
America for the first time in American history after years and years of talk we
have had an Administration that had the guts to take on one of the most powerful lobbies in Washington and that is the
very greedy pharmaceutical industry
and that means that right now seniors on Medicare pay no more than 35 bucks a month for insulin it means that we've
lowered the cost of asthma in halers it means that come January few
months from now no senior in America no matter how many prescription drugs they
take no senior will pay more than $2,000 a year out of pocket of cost
and it means most importantly that finally Medicare is negotiating the cost of prescription
drugs with the pharmaceutical industry that's a big
deal and we should be proud of what Biden and Harris have done in that effort working with many of us in
Congress we got a long way to go yet and that is that in America none of us
should have to pay nickel more for prescription drugs than the people of any other country on
[Applause] Earth let me tell you how pathetic our
current health care system is now I go on for many hours on that particular topic but one just one aspect that
commer is attempting to deal with and that is unbelievably in America today if
you come down with cancer and you undergo go cancer treatment it turns out
that 25% of the people who get that cancer treatment either go bankrupt or
deplete their financial the fam's financial resources can you believe that can you imagine people dealing with this
terrible disease struggling for their life and then they got to worry about whether or not their family
is going to go bankrupt what kamla Harris believes what I believe what I I
think everybody in this room BS we have got to cancel all medical debt in
[Applause]
America now let me touch on an issue that is not discussed enough in this campaign and there needs a lot more
discussion there are a lot of angry people in America and you know what
people have a right to be angry
but when you get angry take out your anger on the people
who caused the problem not people who are even worse off than you
are and yesterday as Alexandria mentioned Madison Square Garden we
saw what misdirected and vicious and ugly anger is all about we saw a people
on the floor talking about comma Harris
in not only a racist way but in a vulgar sexist
way we saw racism on stage in a way that I never thought I would be seeing in the
year 2024 xenophobia on stage in a way that I never thought I would be saved
but I did not notice that one of those people who was so angry so vicious so
ugly had the guts to take on the ruling class whose greed is destroying
America that they did not have you see it's always easy to pick on
people below you people who are hurting people are worse off nothing new demagogues have done that for years are
taking on the big money interests the people who have the wealth the people who have the power the people who call
the tunes well I didn't see anybody up on that stage have the guts to do that
and that is precisely what our job
is what our job is not only in the next week to elect KLA Harris is our next
president but I job is the day after to work hard to build the political
movement that we need that will take on the big money interest and create an
economy and a government that works for all of [Applause]
us and one of the issues we have got to deal with straight up is the issue of big money in politics
just a study came out yesterday I think it was talking about billionaires in this country spending over $ two and A5
billion dollars on this election campaign handful of people couple of hundred billionaires spending enormous
sums of money so it's not enough for these guys that they own the economy now
they want to own the political system and our job is to get rid of this
disastrous citizen Ed Supreme Court [Applause]
decision and move to Public Funding of
Elections now it seems almost every day Donald Trump is out there talking about Bernie Sanders and the farle agenda well
it just so happens to that farle agenda is supported by the overwhelming
majority of the American [Applause]
people whether they're Democrats Republicans Independents conservatives progressives moderates people understand
in America that Health Care is a human right not a
[Applause] privilege they understand that the function of a Health Care system is to
provide quality care for all people not huge profits for their drug companies
and the urance companies and that's why Alexandria Mark
and many of us with your help will finally see that Medicare for all comes
to the United States of America
[Applause] now Donald Trump goes around the country
telling people that climate change is a
hoax now that is that is not only incredibly
stupid it is not only in defiance of what the entire scientific Community
says but I do want to tell you it is incredibly dangerous and I'll tell you
why because if Trump is elected and we give up in the largest economy in the
world the struggle to transform our Energy System away from fossil fuel if
we run away from that the next day China will be doing that and Europe will be
doing that and every other country on Earth in other words we will have surrendered the fight against climate
change and God Only Knows after we saw what happened a few weeks ago in Florida North Carolina we saw the heat waves in
Saudi Arabia in Europe we see the terrible forest fires in Canada in the
west coast of the United States we see the extreme weather disturbances my own State ofont hit time and time again all
over the country trout floods God only knows what this planet
will look like if Trump gets elected and we give up and surrender the struggle
against climate change so we got to stand united we got to beat Trump and we have got to continue the effort to
transform our Energy System [Applause]
and when we do that we're going to create a whole lot of good paying jobs just one example if I may both alexand
worked very hard on the green New Deal and we were able to get a number of components into that into the inflation
reduction act one of the things we got into it just to tell you this one thing is we were able to get A7 billion
program to help working class people put solar panels on their
rooftops and that will not only protect the environment it will create a whole
lot of good paying jobs and that's what we were able uh to do there and that's an effort that kamla will
continue and when we talk about the needs in America we are living in a
highly competitive global economy and I can tell you that in Vermont and I'm sure
it's not much different here in Wisconsin we need all kinds of works we need more doctors we need more nurses we
need more dentists we need more pharmacists we need more Mental Health Counselors we need more plumbers
Carpenters electricians construction workers you know we passed a largest
infrastructure bill in the history of this country and in my state we don't have the workers to even do the work
to rebuild our Wastewater plants and our water systems so we need the best
educated Workforce in the world and it makes no sense to me no sense at all
that we are seeing young people go deeply into debt because they want a higher education maybe it's College
maybe it's the training you need to be a good Blue Collar workup but whatever it
is people should not have to go into debt in order to get the education they need to do the work that our country
desperately [Applause]
needs turns out that half of our older people in this country have nothing
older workers have nothing in the bank 25% of senior citizens are trying to get
by on $15,000 a year or less can you imagine trying to get bu on $15,000 as a senior
or anybody half a senior is trying to get by on $30,000 or less now in the House of
Representatives where Mark and Alexandria work there are 80% of the
Republicans there have a brilliant idea they want to cut Social
Security well we have a somewhat different idea we're going to expand
social [Applause]
security and we're going to do that by lifting the cap right now you have the Absurd situation somebody making 16
million contributes the same amount into Social Security somebody making 168,000
that's absurd lift the cap we're going to expand benefits and extend social security for decades
[Applause]
now Donald Trump and his friends say all a really fine ideas Bernie how you going to pay for them and I will tell you
Donald how we're going to pay for them you're going to start paying your fair share of
[Applause]
taxes right now we have the Absurd situation where billionaires are paying
an effective tax rate lower than truck drivers or nurses if you can believe
that and apparently that is not enough for Trump he came up with this brilliant
idea the other day I don't know if you saw it we're going to eliminate all federal income taxes billionaires
millionaires not going to pay a nickel more in federal income
tax now according to the economist that I have read this will result in one of
the most signifant ific transfers of wealth in the history of our country the
rich billionaires millionaires will pay significantly Less in taxes sales taxes
and regressive taxes will go up all over this country so there you got Donald
Trump a billionaire working day and night for the billionaire class and our job is to start working for the working
class the middle class of this country so that we can create an economy that works for them not not just the
few now as I said earlier as I said earlier people are angry and they should
be angry you know why they should be angry they should be angry that at a time when the richest people of never
had it so good 60% of our people in the United States of America are living
paycheck to paycheck they should be angry that we're
the only major country on Earth not to guarantee Health Care to all people as a human right they should be angry that
CEOs of major corporations are making 300 times what workers are making they
should be furious that our life expectancy in the wealthiest country on
earth is lower than it is compared to almost every other major
country on Earth and here's something that people really should be outraged about in America today if you are A
working class person the likelihood is you will live five to 10 years lower
than if you are rich you got that and you know why that is it's not only the
health care crisis that's important people can't get to a doctor we're losing 60,000 people a year because they
don't get to a doctor when they should they don't have the money High deductibles co- payments all that stuff that's only half of it the other half is
the stress the stress that people people living paycheck to paycheck are
experiencing I grow up in a family and I know in that condition I know what that stress is about it means if the landlord
raises you rent you don't know where you're going to go and you don't know what kind of school you're going to have to find for your kid it means that if
your car breaks down and you don't have any money in the bank how the hell are you going to get it fixed and if you
can't get it fixed how do you get to work and if you don't get to work you get fired and if you get fired what are
you going to do it means said if you are sick you worry about I can't go to the doctor
well God forbid I'm going to end up in the hospital $200,000 Bill how the hell am I going to pay that that's what
people in this country are living with that's why people are dealing with that stress and that's why people are
exhausted physically mentally and are dying 5 to 10 years younger than the rich now brothers and sisters this is
the wealthiest country on Earth we have all kinds of new technology artificial intelligence that can and should make
life better for all of the people not just inrich the people on top over the
last if you can believe it and again this is why people are angry over the
last 50 years despite an explosion in technology and an increase in worker
productivity the average American worker today is is earning Less in inflation
adjusted for dollars than he or she did 50 years ago and you know why because
there was a massive transfer of wealth that went from the bottom 90% to the top
1% so that is where we are today an economy where the people on top have
never ever had it so good a political system dominated by the billionaire
class and yet 60% of our people struggle living paycheck to Patrick dying 5 10
years younger than the rich so as we say in Vermont enough is
enough so let us work in the next week to make KLA our next president in the day
after let us bring our people together Alexandria was talking a moment ago
about how this right-wing demagogues out there they are successful politically
because they divide us up oh you're black I can't work with you you're Latino I can't work with you you're
Asian I won't work with you you're gay I can't work with you you're born in another country I can't work with you we
going to divide us all up that's what they attempt to do and what we have got to do is exactly the opposite what we
have got to do is bring our people together black and white and Latino Asian gay and straight born in America
born abroad to create an a an agenda that speaks to the needs of the working
class of this [Applause]
country and it is an agenda despite what Trump is telling the American people
that is widely supported by democrats Republicans and independents so brothers and sisters
we can do it you know over the last many decades this country has come a long way
in the struggle for civil rights and breaking down racism we should be proud of that we've come a long way in the
struggle against sexism and opening up opportunities to women that never existed 40 50 years ago we have come a
long way a long way in the fight against homophobia we should be proud of all of that but the one area that we have not
made progress and in fact are losing is the economic struggle so what we have got to do is
bring our people together tell the billionaire class that we will no longer
accept their greed this country belongs to all of us not just a handful of
greedy billionaires that's our struggle let's do it thank you [Applause]
all
[Applause]
