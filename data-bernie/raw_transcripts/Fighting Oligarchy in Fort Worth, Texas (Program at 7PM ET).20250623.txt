[Applause] let me let me be a lot of people here tonight
let me thank the MSB choir old 97s for their music
devidito Hutari the AFL CIO first vice president Ernie Moran Pauline Mims Brian
Bryant an old friend of mine and yours Jim High Tower
Kendall Scottup Bed Rock
and the great leader of the progressive caucus in Congress Greg Kazar
and let me start off by making a very simple
statement which is factually correct the future of American politics rests in
Texas [Applause]
as goes Texas so goes America
and you can do it [Music] as Greg and Beto have indicated for too
many years the Democratic Party has turned its back nationally and in Texas
on the needs of working people let's go out let's change that
now this event is part of our fighting oligarchy tour
and tonight I surely am going to talk about oligarchy but given the events of
yesterday I would be remiss if I didn't in a few minutes say a few words about
Trump's illegal unconstitutional attack on Iran
[Music] [Applause] but before I get there let me say
something about where I see our nation today and what I'm going to tell you is
not something you're going to see in the corporate media and it's certainly not something that you're going to hear
talked about very much on the floors of Congress
and the good there is both bad news and
good news and the bad news is that in my view our country today faces more
serious crisis than we have ever faced in the modern history of our country i
wish I could tell you especially for the young people to tell you that that is
not the case but it is and what's even making it worse is that we have a
president who almost every single day goes out of his day out of his way to
undermine our values and the needs of working families [Applause]
but here is the good news the American people are standing up and they are
fighting back our
fighting oligarchy tour has now done 23 events in 15 states
and we have brought out well over 270,000
Americans Democrats Republicans independents
and just last s last Saturday as all of you will recall there were no kings
rallies in every state in this country
and millions and millions and millions of people stood up and said loudly and
clearly "We will not accept oligarchy
we will not accept authoritarianism
we will not accept kleptocracy [Applause]
and we will not accept legislation which gives massive tax breaks to billionaires
and cuts programs that working people desperately need
let me cut right to the chase and that is that right now in America we are
living in an oligarchic form of society and our democracy is being undermined
never before in the history of our country have so few people had so much
wealth and so much power economic power and political power and together we're
going to change that reality
today we have more income and wealth inequality than we have ever had if you
can believe it one man Mr musk owns more wealth
owns more wealth than the bottom 52%
of American households
the top 1% owns more wealth than the bottom 93%
[Applause] ceos of large corporations now make 350
times what their workers make [Applause]
brothers and sisters that is not what America is supposed to be about
but it's not just income and wealth inequality today we have more
concentration of ownership in the economy sector after sector agriculture
trans transportation financial services media we got a handful of large
corporations owning that sector charging us the prices when we go to a grocery
store that they want we got to start breaking up those huge corporations
bottom line is that today the people on top have never ever had it so good but
it's not just economic power it is something that we absolutely do not talk
about enough greg touched on it betto touched on it and that is what political
power what kind of political power the billionaire class has look democracy
ain't complicated it's a very simple form of government you get a vote you get a vote I get a
vote majority wins the damn election
and what elections are supposed to be about is if you want to run for office and I hope that many of you will
but if you want to run for office you should not have to go begging to some
bloody billionaire for campaign funding so that you could win an election
today tragically the billionaire class the oligarchs have enormous political
influence over both political parties
and Donald Trump Donald Trump has been very clear about that he doesn't hide it do you remember
some of you may remember Trump's inauguration i was kind of I don't know how it happened kind of pushed to the
front row kind of where these guys are i'm standing a few feet away from Trump
if you will recall right behind him in plain vision for the
world to see were the three wealthiest people in our country remember that
[Applause] mr musk M
[Applause] Mr bezos [Applause]
uh he'll be offended he's doing a $20 million wedding in Venice today
and he got there in his $500 million yacht oh my goodness
and Mr zuckerberg was there too
but that's not all behind those three guys were 13 other
billionaires who Trump had nominated to run major federal agencies
[Applause] now one should remember what you learned in the sixth grade all right think back
sixth grade civics American history you remember Abraham Lincoln at
Gettysburg remember that so Lincoln goes to Gettysburg a few days
after this horrible battle where thousands and thousands of soldiers died
to end the abomination of slavery okay so Lincoln goes there and he's on the
battlefield and he looks around them and he says in so many words "Those brave men did not
die in vain they died so that we can establish in
our country a government of the people
that is what we believe in and we're not going to let Trump take that away from us
too many people have fought and died to defend American democracy and Trump is
not going to take that away from the American people
but let me tell you how money in politics works because it's not talked
about terribly much in both parties for a start Mr musk spends $270
million to get Trump elected got it
so Trump says "Thanks for the 270 you got me elected i am now going to make you the most powerful person in
government." Musk goes running around Washington DC laying off people at the Social Security
Administration at the Veterans Administration ends USA
which keeps millions of people alive
and but it's not just Mr musk right now and this is really again quite
unbelievable right now if there is any Republican
member of Congress who wakes up one morning and says you know I think maybe
it's not a great idea to give massive tax breaks to the rich and cut programs
that my constituents need i'm not going to vote for this terrible reconciliation bill if anybody were to do that the very
next day Musk or Trump would say "We are
going to primary you and throw you out of office."
Just today just today it's a guy named Mr massie who I have not familiar with i
think I've never met him is a congressman from Kentucky a very very conservative congressman completely
opposed to my pers perspective we differ on everything and yet Mr massie
apparently has read the Constitution of the United States
and he has been public that Trump has violated the War Powers
Act does not have the authority to and just today for his crime of defending
the Constitution Trump announced that they are going to primary Mr massie in
other words in other words you know there was a time
and I'm old enough to tell you this to be true they were independent members of Congress they stood up and they said
"Look I'm here to represent my constituents this is what I believe you don't like it tough luck." But that is
not the Republican party today if you stand up in any way to Trump or Musk
they are going to try to defeat you politically but I wish I could tell you it's just
the Republican party it is not all right now let me tell you something else
in my view what the Netanyahu government in Israel is doing is absolutely
horrific [Applause]
right now right now what they are doing is literally
starving Palestinian children in Gaza
and I brought forth two very simple resolutions which said basically given the fact that the
Netanyahu government is breaking international and American law we should
not provide them with one nickel more in US military aid
this is not a radical This is not a radical resolution yet I
can only get 15 votes in the Senate on one and 16 on
another now why is that do you think it is because members of the Senate feel
good about children in Gaza starving to death they don't you think they don't
know what's going on they do but they understand that if they stood up and
said "We're not going to give another nickel to the murderous government of Netanyahu," you know what happens to
them the next day Democratic super PACs like Apac say "You're out of here."
And that is why in my view there is no more important political issue than
ending this disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision
it is not complicated in America our democracy means one
person one vote not billionaires buying elections
[Applause] so this uh this small group of oligarchs
who control our economy control much of the media control much of the United
States Congress what kind of economy have they created well obviously
they have created a great economy for them
[Applause] the truth is the people on top today
have never ever had it so good in the history of our country
but but as all of you know while the 1% are doing phenomenally well
tens of millions of families in Texas Vermont and in every other state in this
country are struggling to put food on the table
struggling to pay for outrageously high rents and housing costs
struggling to pay for health care struggling to provide the basic needs
that their families have and here is again a reality that we don't talk about
very much you live right now in the richest country in the history of the
world but in the midst of all of that
60% of our people are living paycheck to
paycheck [Applause] do you all know what that means i grew
up in a family that lived paycheck to paycheck i suspect many of you are
living paycheck to paycheck correct what does that mean no savings it means
you got no savings what else does it mean
you can't afford rent what else can't afford health care what else
can't afford to take a vacation what else you can't afford to put any money in the
bank and save for retirement what else
all right and on and on it goes but here is the point that we don't talk about
and that is if you are in a family majority of American families that are
struggling every day and worrying and worrying about how you're going to feed the kids what happens if my mom my dad
gets ill we can't afford the prescription drugs i don't have enough money to take them to the doctor if god
forbid there's an operation our family is going to go bankrupt what happens if my car breaks down
right my car breaks down cost $1,000 to get it fixed you know most families in
America don't have that thousand bucks and what happens you can't get to work because your car break go broke down you
get fired and if you get fired you got no income and your family is in deep dudu
that is the reality facing millions of families and at the end of
the day you know what all of that stress does what does stress do to people it
kills them it does this is not just rhetoric it's what doctors tell us
stress day after day about how we can survive impacts your body your
cardiovascular system impacts your mental health
and here is the sad reality as a nation we are now living four years shorter
lives than other wealthy countries our life expectancy is lower but what is even more shocking is if you are working
class in America you will have a 7year
shorter life than the 1%
do you understand what I'm saying in other words all of that economic stress it's not just oh I don't have a
great car oh I don't live in a fancy house that economic stress is killing
people in the richest country in the history of the world
today in America half of older workers have nothing in
the bank as they face retirement you got that people have worked their entire
lives 60 65 they got nothing in the bank
22% of our seniors are trying to get by on $15,000
a year or less 85 million Americans are uninsured or underinsured we have the
highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country 800,000
Americans sleep out on the streets and 20 million families spend half of their
income on housing millions of kids can't afford to fulfill
their dream of a higher education brothers and sisters this is America
this is the wealthiest country in the world we must not allow that to continue
happening
and our job our job is to take on the oligarchs and
to create an economy that works for all of us not just the 1%
and as bad as all of that is if you can believe it what Republicans and Trump
are proposing right now is a reconciliation bill trump's big
beautiful bill
this bill would give $650 billion dollar in tax breaks to the 1%
[Applause] 400 billion to large corporations in tax
breaks and to pay for it they're going to make
massive cuts in Medicaid nutrition and education
[Applause] you know
I don't know how people could sleep at night by voting for a bill which gives
$200 billion in tax breaks to the top 210 of 1%
and then and then takes food literally
out of the mouths of hungry kids this is immoral and this is disgraceful
so brothers and sisters we have got to do everything we can to fight Trump's
agenda but we have got to do something else we need to go on the offense
and offer an alternative vision for this country as to where we want America to
go and at the top of that agenda at this
moment is to say no to the Netanyahu Trump war
in Iran [Applause]
let me just tell you a story if I might back in the mid 1960s I was a young man
yes I was young at one point and at that point
the American government then under Democratic leadership lied to the
American people and took us into a terrible war in Vietnam
now I know a lot of young people young people might not be familiar with that war
but the American people were lied to about what South Vietnam was doing and
so forth and so on and we went into that war
in that war 58,000 young Americans died
and over 300,000 were wounded the Vietnam War devastated my entire
generation it will never leave my mind because those were my friends people my
age who went off to Vietnam my wife had a couple of good friends went off to Vietnam never came back and for those
who came back it's not just 300,000 who were wounded many of those came back
wounded in spirit in mind they were devastated by what they saw they came
home to a country that was divided because many people opposed that war and
that war not only caused so many American casualties
it killed millions of Vietnamese and it brought instability to that
entire region and the result of that is a crazy group of people called the Kamar Rouge rose to power in Cambodia and
waged a genocide in Cambodia which killed over 2 million Cambodians
the cost of the war to the American taxpayer was many many hundreds of
billions of dollars in other words a lie caused massive horrible death and
suffering that was what my generation went through in the 60s and then years
later in 2002 I was a secondterm member of Congress
from Vermont just elected to the Congress and we heard the rhetoric in 2002
get stronger and stronger about the need to go to war against Iraq and its leader
Saddam Hussein we were told by all kinds of people in
the establishment and much of the media that Iraq was building weapons of mass
destruction and that if we did not act if we did not
act quickly and decisively nuclear weapons would be dropping on
America and I want you to hear this because this tells you a lot about what's going on today among those
back in 2002 who told us that we had to go to war in
Iraq was none other than Benjamin Netanyahu the prime minister of Israel
[Applause] and this is what and I quote this is what Netanyahu stated
in a congressional hearing and I quote "There is no question whatsoever that
Saddam is seeking nuclear weapons if you take out Saddam's regime I guarantee you
that it will have enormous positive reverberations." End quote netanyahu now
President George W bush at the time he said quote "Saddam's regime is seeking a
nuclear bomb." End quote and he argued for a preemptive attack saying quote "We
cannot wait for the final proof the smoking gun which could come in the form
of a mushroom cloud." End quote the United States Congress
against my vote went to war in Iraq and
we became involved in a terrible regional civil war there
no weapons of mass destruction were ever found
that war was based on a lie a lie which cost us 4,500
young Americans 32,000 wounded and trillions of dollars i will
never forget going to funeral after funeral in my
small state of Vermont for young men who died in that war
as a result of the war the entire region was destabilized
hundreds of thousands of Iraqis also died in that war what the is a four
a few months ago in terms of
what's going on right now Trump's own director of national intelligence told
Congress this is his national director
of intelligence said quote Congress continu the intelligence
community continues to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon exactly
and Supreme Leader Kmeni has not authorized the nuclear weapons program
he suspended in 2003 end quote the Netanyahu government of Israel
started this war with an unprovoked attack against Iran
this is the same government this is the same government that is
currently starving and shooting down innocent people in Gaza
[Applause] brothers and sisters we cannot allow
history to repeat itself the United States faces enormous problems here at
home we should be spending our money and our manpower rebuilding America not going
into a war against Iran
i am not going to I am not going to tell you that the
fight against the oligarchs and the war makers is not is going to be easy it is
not going to be easy they have enormous wealth they have enormous power they
control much of the media but this is what I do know the American people do
not want a government of billionaires
they want health care as a human right
they don't want tax breaks for oligarchs they want the rich to start paying their
fair share of taxes they don't want a war with Iran they
want to invest in our own people
now Trump and other demagogues gain power by dividing us up
by dividing us up by the color of our skin or where we were born or what our
religion might be brothers and sisters let us not allow them to divide us up
let us stand together let's take them on let's transform this country thank you
all very much
thank you
the people [Applause]
say we Reution we
