Nope. It's not Bernie. It is you.
Let me thank our brothers and sisters in
the trade union movement for being
here. Let me thank Unite here, Lyona
Local 724.
ILWU the long
shoreman, CNA
nurses, NN York
nurses, NUHW Kaiser
nurses,
UTLA,
UAW, California Labor Federation, AFL
CIO. And today we pledge with our
brothers and sisters in the trade union
movement. We are going to grow the
movement. Millions of workers want to
join unions because they know they're
going to get better wages, better
benefits, better working conditions.
Let's do it.
And I want to thank the musicians who
have been with us today. So
great. Ray's Gospel Choir. Thank you.
The Red
Pairs, Jeff
Rosentock, Indigo
Duza, Dirty
Projectors, Joan
Bayz, Maggie Rogers,
Neil
Young, and you know why we had all of
these great musicians here today? It's
not just to entertain you. It's more
than that.
We're going to make our revolution with
joy. We're going to sing and dance our
way to victory against hatred and
divisiveness. So I want to thank all of
the musicians who have been with
us and I want to thank the political
leaders who have been
here. Ro and
Camililla and Jimmy. Thank
you. And mostly I want to thank all of
you. And I want to tell you
something. You are making Donald
Trump. We need a medic. Medic.
Medic. Okay.
Okay,
your presence here
today. And by the way, there are some
36,000 of you.
The largest rally that we have ever had.
And your presence here
today is making Donald Trump and Elon
Musk very nervous.
Last time we did a rally in Denver a
little bit smaller than
this. Thank you, LA.
Elon Musk announced that everybody at
the rally or most of the people were
paid
organizers. Anybody here get paid to
come today?
And Donald Trump, very envious of
sizes, he said, "Well, Bernie has
rallies of two or 3,000 people. Can't
compete with Trump." He
lied. So, I invite the president to come
to LA.
Tell the people here why you think it's
a great
idea to cut Medicaid and nutrition and
healthcare so you can give tax breaks to
billionaires. The people of LA would
love to hear
that. So why are we here in LA today?
And the answer is obvious. We are living
in a
moment of extraordinary danger. And how
we respond to this
moment will not only impact our
lives, but will impact the lives of our
kids and future generations. And in
terms of the
climate, it will depend. We can depend
on whether or not the planet Earth
survives. That's why we're here
today. We're living at a
moment where a handful of
billionaires control the economic and
political life of our country.
We're living in a moment with a
president who has no understanding or
respect for the Constitution of the
United
States. And let us make no doubt about
it, moving us rapidly toward an
authoritarian form of
society. And Mr. Trump. We ain't going
there. We are living in a moment where
the Republican party has to a large
degree become a cult of the
individual, obeying Trump's every wish,
and at a time of massive income and
wealth inequality. Right now, as we
speak, they are plotting about how they
can give 1.1 trillion in tax breaks to
the 1% and devastate programs that
working families
need. You know, it's funny. Just
yesterday, our good friend Elon
Musk, Mr. bus sent out a tweet and in
essence he said, "You know, Bernie
Sanders has been talking about the
growth of oligarchy year after year
after year." Well, Elon, you're damn
right. That's what I've been talking
about. The difference
is I'm no longer talking about how we're
moving to oligarchy. I'm talking about
how we are living today in an oligarchic
form of
society. Three months ago when Trump was
inaugurated, standing right behind him
during his
inauguration were the three wealthiest
people in this country, Mr. Musk, Mr.
Bezos, and Mr. Zuckerberg.
And right behind them were 13 other
billionaires who Trump had nominated to
head up major federal
agencies. And that brothers and sisters
is what oligarchy is all about.
You know, lately, given what's happening
in
America, I've been remembering the
history lessons that I learned when I
was in the sixth grade. And I remember,
and I think many of you will recall, you
think about your
education. You'll remember hearing about
Abraham Lincoln on the fields of
Gettysburg in 1863. And that was just a
few
days after 20,000 Union
soldiers had either died or been win
wounded fighting against the nightmare
of
slavery. And Lincoln looked out on that
field and this is what he said and you
will all remember it. He said,
quote, "We highly we here highly resolve
that these dead shall not have died in
vain, that this nation under God shall
have a new birth of freedom, and that
government of the people, by the people,
for the people shall not perish from the
earth.
And that is precisely
why we are here today. To make sure that
government of, by, and for the people
does not perish, and that we do not
become a government of the billionaire
class, by the billionaire class, and for
the billionaire class.
The American people do not want the
richest guy on earth running all over
Washington DC decimating the Social
Security
Administration, making it harder. It's
the richest guy on earth. Making it
harder for old people with disabilities
to get the benefits that they paid into.
proposing to lay off
83,000 workers at the Veterans
Administration, denying the health care
that the men and women who put their
lives on the line to defend us
deserve, slashing the Department of
Education, decimating US
aid, which by the way means that
hundreds The thousands if not millions
of the most desperate people in this
world will die as a
result. And when we talk about
oligarchy, it is not just
economics. I trust that all of you know
that you are living under a corrupt
campaign finance system which allows
billionaires to buy elections.
Don't tell me about democracy when Musk
himself can put
$270 million to elect Donald Trump and
then get rewarded with the most
important position in
government. But it's not just Musk and
Republicans. It's the Democratic party
as
well. Their billionaires tell
candidates, "Don't stand up to the
powerful special interest." And too many
Democrats are listening to them. And
that is
why that is why if we want to preserve
democracy in America, we've got to
overturn this disastrous Citizens United
Supreme Court
decision. And we got to move to public
funding of
elections in America. One person, one
vote. Not billionaires buying
elections. And let me tell you
something about the
oligarchs. They are very
very religious people.
But their religion is not based on doing
unto others as you would have them do
unto you. Their religion is not based on
love or
justice. Their religion is based on
greed, greed, and more greed.
All over this
country, in Vermont, California, all
over this country, we have a serious
problem with drug addiction, with
alcoholism, with other forms of
addiction. But in my honest opinion, the
most serious addiction crisis we face is
the addiction of the oligarchy toward
greed.
They got billions and billions of
dollars. It's not enough. They need
more. And if they have to step on the
poor and the disabled and workingclass
people, that is what they will do.
Unless we stop them and we will stop
them.
But it's not just oligarchy. We are
fighting. We're
fighting.
Okay.
EMT. Okay. Raise your hand where the
problem is. Okay. We got somebody
there. Got it. Somebody. Okay. Thank
you.
But it's not just oligarchy. We are
fighting. We're fighting a president who
undermines our constitution every day
and threatens our freedom of speech and
assembly and whose agents are rounding
up innocent people off the streets,
putting them in unmarked vans, and
throwing them in detention centers.
That is what happens in
dictatorships, not
democracies. And we're going to stop
that outrageous action on the part of
the
president. You know, our founding
fathers of this country were no dummies.
They wrote a constitution and
established a form of government with a
separation of
powers. Remember reading all about that?
You got a legislative body, Congress,
you got an executive branch, president,
you got a judiciary, the federal courts.
And they wrote that document because
they had just fought a brutal war
against the autocratic king of England.
And what they understood as they were
forming this new country that they never
wanted to see a nation where one person
had unlimited
power. Well, Trump wants that power. We
are not giving it to him.
Trump is suing the media because they
say bad things about him. Oh, how
horrible is that? He has sued ABC, CBS,
Meta, the De Mo Register. Here's FCC is
investigating NPR and PBS.
He loves the media when they fawn over
him, but he can't take criticism. This
from a guy who has made vulgar comments
about his opponents. Hey, Mr. President,
if you can't take criticism, get out of
politics. That's what democracy is
about.
Trump is going after the powers of
Congress. He is illegally abolishing
agencies that Congress created. He's
withholding funding that Congress has
appropriated. He is establishing tariffs
that he has no legal right to do.
But it's not just the media and Congress
that he's trying to intimidate in an
absolutely outrageous and
unconstitutional way. He is going after
the
judiciary. His view this his view is if
a if a decision comes down from a judge
that you don't like, you try to get rid
of that judge and impeach him or her.
He is going after law firms that have
opposed him and his interest in the past
and
disgracefully a number of these law
firms have caved
in. He is going after universities.
You know, the function of a university
school of higher education is to pursue
the truth, not to cave in to an
authoritarian president to protect the
federal grants they
get. But it is not just Trump's and his
administration's domestic policy that we
should be concerned about. For the first
time in our 250 year history, we have a
president who is aligning himself with
dictatorship
abroad. No, Mr. Trump, Ukraine did not
start that war. Putin and Russia did.
We must lead the world in supporting
democracies, not supporting Putin and
dictatorships. And let me tell you
something
else. Trump wants over 8 billion more
dollars to go to Netanyahu's war
machine.
Israel has a right to defend itself
against terrorism, but it does not have
a right to go to war against the entire
Palestinian people.
It does not have the right to kill
50,000 people, injure over a 100,000,
and destroy the entire
infrastructure. And as bad as that
is, as bad as that is, Trump wants to
expel the 2.2 2 million people in Gaza
in order to create a playground for his
billionaire
friends. That is beyond insane. And we
will never never let that happen.
Brothers and sisters, not just
oligarchy and authoritarianism. Our job
right now, at a time when the very
richest people in America are becoming
phenomenally richer, our job is to
create an economy that works for all of
us, not just the people on
top. All right, I'm going to do
something radical here. You ready?
got to tell the truth.
Got to talk about what's really going on
in America today. And that is we are
living with two
Americas. One America, the people on
top, have never ever in the history of
our country had it so
good. Today, we have more income and
wealth inequality than we have ever had.
The three wealthiest people own more
wealth than the bottom half of American
society. 170 million
people. The top
1% 1% owns more wealth than the bottom
90% and the CEOs of major corporations
now earn 300 times what their workers
are making. Is there a medical issue?
All right, we need an EMT there. Raise
your hand, guys.
But it's not
just income and wealth inequality. We
have more concentration of ownership
today than we have ever had.
We have a handful of corporations owning
sector and sector of our economy. So
that is one America, people on top doing
phenomenally well. Let me tell you about
the other America that you know very
very well and that is that 60% of our
people are living paycheck to paycheck.
Anybody here living paycheck to
paycheck? All right. I grew unlike
Donald Trump. I grew up in a family that
lived paycheck to paycheck. So I know a
little bit about
that. And the result of living paycheck
to paycheck is such if you can believe
it that workingass people in America die
7 years earlier than the
rich. All right. Going to ask you a
question. Why is that?
All right. You got it. The answer is
stress. If you got to worry every single
day how you're going to feed your
kids, how you going to pay the
rents, how you going to make sure that
your car doesn't break down so you can
get to
work, how you going to afford to provide
for your kid when your kid gets sick and
needs to go to a doctor. How you have to
work when your schedule is changed every
day and you have a boss who doesn't care
about you.
When you live under those conditions day
after day, year after year, it eats away
at your body. It eats
away in your mind. We need to create an
economy where all of our people can live
out their life expectancy in the way
that they should.
And do you know why people all over this
country are angry? In fact, some of them
end up voting for Trump. Let me tell you
something you don't hear much about in
the corporate media or in the halls of
Congress.
Today, if you can believe it, despite a
huge increase in worker
productivity, real inflation accounted
for wages are lower today than they were
52 years
ago. So, workers are producing more and
more, but all of what they produce, all
of the benefits are going to the top 1%.
And during that same period, we have
seen a $75 trillion transfer of wealth
from the bottom 90% to the top
1%. Today in America, half of older
workers have nothing in the bank as they
face
retirement. And 22% of our seniors are
living on
$15,000 a year or less.
and 800,000 Americans are sleeping out
on the
streets today. As I look at this great
crowd, I remember another rally that I
attended. I wasn't up here. I was way
way back. And that was in
1963. I was in Washington for Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr.'s great I have a dream
speech.
And the truth is, while many, many
problems remain, we should be proud that
we have made significant progress in
fighting racism.
And I can
remember several decades ago that in the
United States Senate there were all of
two women, virtually no women governors,
though very few women in the House.
Hundreds of women died every year
because they could not access legal
abortions.
I can remember growing up when young
people who were gay were ashamed to
acknowledge that and suffered in their
silence. And nobody back then would have
dreamed that we would achieve gay
marriage in many states in this country.
So my point is that we have made and
should be proud of the fact that we have
made progress in a number of enormously
important
areas. But we should also be conscious
that in perhaps the most important
issue, the economic struggle that so
many Americans are now engaged in, we
have lost ground.
Back in
1944, President Franklin Delano
Roosevelt, one of the great presidents
in the history of our
country, he gave a state of the union
address and this is what he said back in
1944. He said, "You know what? We are a
great country. We have a great
constitution. We have freedom of speech,
freedom of religion, etc. But what we
need to add to that is to understand
that economic rights are human
rights. That if you can't afford to go
to a doctor, doesn't really matter about
voting. If you can't afford to feed feed
your kids, freedom of assembly doesn't
matter that much. He said economic
rights are human rights. So
today in the year 2025 we have got to
pick up that banner. Economic rights are
human rights. Every single person is
entitled to
that. And this gets to a very
fundamental issue. Musk and his friends
see you as nothing more than workers to
be disposed of. They got rid of tens of
thousands of federal workers. And when
information, artificial information and
robotics comes, they're going to throw
you out on the street as well. They
don't give a damn about
you. They don't give a damn about your
kids. And what we have got to do is say,
"Sorry, we are human beings.
And we are
entitled we are entitled to certain
fundamental economic rights. So no, we
are not going to give more tax breaks to
billionaires. We're going to demand that
they start paying their fair share of
taxes.
No, we're not going to keep a federal
minimum wage of
$7.25 an hour. We're going to raise that
wage to a living wage. No worker in
America should live in poverty. End of
discussion.
And we're going to pass the PRO Act to
make sure that
employers cannot act illegally when
workers are trying to form unions. We're
going to grow the trade union
movement in America. We're not going to
turn our backs on our parents and
grandparents who helped build this
country. We're not going to cut Social
Security. We're going to expand Social
Security
benefits. And by the way, we're going to
re-establish defined benefit pensions
for workers in this
America. Instead of making massive cuts
to Medicaid, we must do what every other
major country on earth does. It ain't
radical. Healthcare is a human right.
We're going to guarantee healthcare to
all through a Medicare for all
singlepayer
system. The function of health care is
not to make the insurance companies and
the drug companies rich.
And we're going to stop paying 10 times
more for some prescription drugs than
the people of other countries. We can
lower prescription drugs by
50%. Here in LA, in Burlington, Vermont,
all across this country, we have a major
housing
crisis. Am I right?
And it's not just homelessness. It's
people paying 40, 50, 60% of their
limited incomes in housing. Instead of
spending a trillion dollars a year on
the military, let's build 5 million
units of lowincome and affordable
housing.
Brothers and sisters, we live in a
competitive global economy. And if we're
going to effectively compete, we need
the best educated workforce in the
world.
It is nothing less than
insane and
counterproductive that we have young
people leaving higher education 50
$80,000 in debt. We need more doctors.
You know what doctors are leaving
medical school with? $500,000 in debt.
Nurses are leaving $100,000 in debt.
Education is a human right from child
care through
college. We need sheet metal workers. We
need carpenters. We need construction
workers. We need apprenticeship
programs. We need to make public
colleges, universities, and trade
schools tuitionfree.
Donald Trump thinks that climate change
is a quote unquote hoax originating in
China. This state, California, has gone
through enough pain to know that climate
change is not a hoax. It is an
existential threat to this state, to
Vermont, to the whole country and the
whole
world. Instead of appeasing the fossil
fuel industry who are lying and
destroying our planet, we're going to
transform our energy system and lead the
world into sustainable energy and energy
efficiency. And we create millions of
goodaying jobs as we do that.
Look, I don't have to tell anyone
here that this is a difficult moment in
the modern history of our country. We've
never gone through anything like this.
But this is what I do want to say.
Despair is not an
option. Giving up and hiding under the
covers is not acceptable.
The stakes are just too
high. And let me tell
you, when Donald Trump looks out at this
crowd and they pay attention to this
stuff and Elon Musk does, you are
scaring the hell out of them
because they know what you know. And
what I
know is that they are the
1%, we are the
99%. Back in
1857 when
abolitionists were working day and night
to end the nightmare of slavery.
This is what Frederick Douglas, you all
remember Frederick Douglas,
very great abolitionist. Listen closely
to what he said because it is as
relevant today as it was back then in
the fight against slavery. This is what
he said. Quote, "Power conceds nothing
without a
demand. It never did and it never will.
find out just when any people will
quietly submit to. And you have found
out the exact measure of injustice and
wrong which will be imposed upon them.
And these will continue till they are
resisted with either words or blows or
with both. The limits of tyrants are
prescribed by the endurance of those who
whom they
oppress. The oligarchy will concede
nothing. They have the
wealth. They have the power. They own
Congress. They own the White House. They
own much of the
media, but they don't own
us. Now, I'm not going to tell you that
it's going to be easy. It's
not. We're going to have to fight them
doortodoor, workplace to workplace,
school to school. We're going to have to
educate. We're going to have to
mobilize. We're gonna have to stand up
in a dozen different ways. But from the
bottom of my heart, and I've been to
every state of this country, I don't
care whether you're Republican,
Democrat, or independent. The people of
this country do not want oligarchy. They
do not want
authoritarianism. And they want a
government that works for all of us, not
just the 1%. Thank you all very much.
Look in your eyesise.
Good to be
true in my heart and I'm
feeling
crazy around us.
Thank you all. Let's go forward. Let's
do it.
