well thank you all very much for being out here tonight this is quite
the crowd
and let me let me thank our musicians let me thank Veronica Guerrero a great
public school teacher sereth Garcia who talked about what
Medicaid means to her life lenned Aguila who understands we've got
to build the trade union movement in this country
kendall Scutter who understands that for many years the Democratic Party
in Texas has been run in a terrible way it's got to be turned around and he
intends to do that
and lastly let me thank my friend Greg Casar from Austin
texas you have given us one of the outstanding members of the US Congress
and we appreciate that very much
this is a tough time for America and it's a tough time for Macallen
and I'm not going to deny that for a second and I hope tonight that we're
going to have a serious discussion about what's going on in our country and what's going on right here
there's a lot of bad news clearly in the fact that we have as a nation
today more serious crisis than we have ever had in the modern
history of America and if you're feeling a little bit overwhelmed
you're not alone that's a feeling that is being experienced all over America
that's the bad news but I'll tell you the good news and that is in our fighting oligarchy tour that Greg has
been a part of and we've gone to this is our 13th state more than a quarter of a
million people have come out
and just last Saturday on the no kings day
Millions and millions of Americans in every state of this country came out and
loudly and clearly they said no to oligarchy
no to authoritarianism and picking people up off of the streets
no to kleptocracy and a president who's going to make
billions of dollars off of his presidency [Applause]
and no to legislation which will provide if passed
hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks to the top 1% and make
devastating cuts to the needs of working families
so that's what's going on in the country and let me be more specific
you are now living in an oligarchic form of society
some of you may have noticed when Trump was inaugurated
seems like 20 years ago but it was just a few months ago
standing right behind him were the three wealthiest people in America mr musk Mr
bezos Mr zuckerberg
you know those guys and then seated right behind them
were another 13 billionaires who Trump had nominated to head various
major government agencies
so I don't have to tell you or the American people that today we have a government of the
billionaires by the billionaires and for the billionaires
i don't have to tell you because Mr trump did already
today in America we have more income and wealth inequality
than we have ever had in the history of the United States of America now what
I'm going to tell you doesn't get on TV too much and certainly not discussed in
the halls or the floors of Congress you got one man our friend Mr musk who owns
more wealth than the bottom 52%
of households in America do you hear that
one person owning more wealth than over half the households in America you got
in America today top 1% owning more wealth than the bottom 93%
of Americans [Applause] you got CEOs in America now making 350
times what their average employees make
so bottom line you got the people on top never in the history of this country
have done better than they're doing it today and it's not just income and wealth inequality you got more
concentration of ownership in America in every sector of our society whether it's
agriculture or transportation or financial services you got a few giant
multinational corporations who control what is produced and more importantly
the high prices for the products that you pay
bottom line is that in the wealthiest country in
America in the history of the world we have two Americas one America people on top doing
phenomenally well but there is another America that I suspect the people in Macallen are very familiar with
and that is that while the 1% is doing extraordinarily well there are
millions and millions of families in Vermont and here in Texas who are
struggling to pay the rent struggling String to pay for health care
struggling to put food on the table to pay for child care and other basic
necessities of life
and again I hope you hear this because you're not going to see it on TV very often today in America
660% of Americans are living paycheck to
paycheck you all know what living paycheck to paycheck is about yeah I I'm afraid many
of you do i grew up in a family that lived paycheck to paycheck and what
that means is you got people mom dad working hard sometimes 50 60 hours a
week just trying desperately to bring in
enough money to keep the family going and people are worried what happens if
the rent goes up what happens if the car breaks down what happens if mother gets
sick and suddenly the whole thing could unravel because people have literally no
money in the bank they're living paycheck to paycheck
and I'll tell you something else about paycheck i want to ask you later on I'm going to ask you i want you to talk about what it means to live paycheck to
paycheck but here's something else that we don't talk about very much in America as a nation despite the huge amount of
money we spend on health care we live on average about four years shorter lives
than people in other wealthy countries got it that's bad you know what's even
worse in America today if you are working class on average you will live
seven years shorter life than the 1%
all right somebody help me out on this one why is that why do workingclass people live shorter lives than people
have a lot of money all right all right all right somebody raise their hand here
yes sir overworked underpaid over underpaid and what does that contribute
to all right the key word here is stress
yes ma'am do you want to jump in food desert food desert not having access to
decent food what else you got yes ma'am
poor access to health care boy you guys hit the nail right on the head all right
inadequate wages no vacations people are overworked not
able to retire not able to retire
all you add all of that stuff up and what doctors will tell you nobody debates this is that when people
every day are worried about how they survive
what the stress does is really have a negative impact on their bodies on their
cardiovascular system and on their minds mental stress that is the simple reality and you add
all of that stuff up that is why workingclass people die seven years
earlier than the wealthy
well that's another issue we'll get to in a minute
and people in this country today are very angry they're angry for a lot
of reasons and sometimes they get angry at the wrong people for the wrong reasons
[Applause] and I want to get into that in a moment
with your help but what I want to say right now when you talk about why people are angry
what is not widely known I want you to hear this one carefully as all of you
can imagine over the last 50 years there has been an explosion in technology and
an increase in worker productivity right it means that every worker here is
producing a lot more than somebody in that position did 50 years ago
and yet despite that huge increase in worker productivity
the truth of the matter is that inflation accounted for wages weekly
wages are lower today than they were 52 years ago
do you understand what I'm saying so you got this huge increase in productivity
where is all of that increased wealth going and the answer is that over the
last 50 years there has been a $75 trillion transfer of wealth from the
bottom 90% to the top 1%
and in the midst of all of that stagnant wages people not being able to keep up
with inflation cost of child care exploding groceries exploding that in
the midst of all of that right now literally today I'll be back in
Washington on Monday we'll be dealing with this trump has brought forward with the Republican leadership a
reconciliation bill or what he calls his big beautiful bill
[Music] and at a time of massive income and
wealth inequality this bill would provide 650
billion dollar in tax breaks to the top 1%
it would provide more than $400 billion to large corporations
who will use those tax breaks to bring in robotics and artificial
intelligence which will throw workers in this country out on the street
and the Republicans are paying for these huge tax breaks in an
incredibly insidious and immoral way everybody here knows that our health
care system today is broken right we got 85 million Americans who are
uninsured or underinsured what these guys want to do is cut Medicaid by some
$700 billion dollar and throw 16 million more
Americans off of the health care they have
and it's not just individuals who would be impacted nursing homes who are already struggling
receive twothirds of their funding from Medicaid and these nursing homes would either
have to shut down or lower their quality of care
it would be these cuts to Medicaid would be devastating for community health centers and I fought very hard over the
years to build community health centers all over America including Texas so
people regardless of income could walk in and get the healthcare they need
this bill cuts in Medicaid devastating not only the community health centers
but the hospitals to the entire health care system and here's something that is really unbelievable and shocking there
was a study done recently by the Yale School of Public Health in the University of Pennsylvania and they
estimated that when you throw 16 million people off of the health care that they
have people who are working class people who are lower income there will be an
additional 50,000 unnecessary deaths every single year
[Applause] [Music] but it's not just our health care system
that would be devastated by this legislation and this again is is almost you wonder
the mentality what world these guys are living in all of us know that there are kids in Texas and in Vermont who go
hungry they don't get enough food right there are senior citizens who are
dependent on meals on wheels program congregate meal program so they get at
least one decent nutritious meal a day this legislation would cut $290
billion from nutrition it is shameful it is immoral it is outrageous
and I don't have to tell anybody here that kids all over this country struggling trying to figure out how they
can afford to go to college or get the training they need to get a good job
this bill would slash education funding by $350
billion dollar a year
brothers and sisters what we are dealing with is not only a massive attack
on working families in order to benefit the very very rich and when I talk about
the power of the rich it's not only economic i want you also to understand what a lot of people don't perceive
we have today a corrupt campaign finance system
all right [Applause] if you can believe it I mean it's almost
hard to believe that this takes place in our country elon Musk himself spent $270
million to elect Donald Trump
and the reward that he got for electing Trump was to become the most per
powerful person in government running all over cutting the Social Security
Administration proposing to cut if you can believe this
83,000 jobs from the Veterans Administration
the American people know that when we have men and women who put their lives
on the line to defend our country you pro keep the promises we made to them
you don't cut back on the healthcare and the benefits that they receive
[Applause] but what Trump is doing is not just
waging an attack against the working class of this country he is moving
America very rapidly and dangerously into an authoritarian form of society
all right we are supposed to have under our constitution
a separation of powers you got an executive branch you got a legislative branch you have a judiciary
and this power hungry man wants it all
he is usurpering and taking away powers in the Congress he is threatening the
judiciary if a judge rules against him threatening to impeach that judge
[Applause] he is going after and suing media
because some media has the courage to point out what he is doing
[Applause] now this is a guy who every day is
making vicious attacks against people he doesn't like but when people attack him
he is very sensitive his feelings get hurt okay
very sensitive man so he has sued
sued ABC he has sued Meta he has sued the De
Moines Register because he didn't like a poll that they did and right now he is
waging a major lawsuit against 60 Minutes and CBS because he didn't like an interview they
did with Kla Harris he is going after universities in
America because he doesn't like the courses they teach
he is going after law firms because they represented clients he didn't like
[Applause] and now right now in Macallen and other
parts of this country we're seeing what authoritarianism is about in its ugliest way we're seeing
people being stopped on the street being picked up at their work place
thrown into vans and taken god knows where without due process
[Applause] grabbing people
throwing them into a van is what takes place in dictatorships
maybe it takes place in Russia or North Korea but it's not supposed to happen in
America and we are going to fight back on that
[Applause]
the major point that I want to make is that the overwhelming majority of the
American people do not support Trumpism [Applause]
they do not believe that we should have a government run by billionaires
some of you may recall a speech Abraham Leon gave on the Gettysburg battlefield
in 1863 you know what he said he looked out on this battlefield where a terrible battle had taken place in the fight
against slavery and he looked out there and he said "What we owe these men and
thousands and thousands died on that day many were wounded and died later." He
said "We owe them a vision which says that America will have a government of
the people by the people for the people." That's what we believe
[Applause] now this country has gone through
difficult times in the past fight over slavery
the abolitionists in the 1840s 1850s that struggle we've gone through the
terrible depression in the 1920s where 1930s where unemployment was like 25%
got into World War II we were totally unprepared to fight two wars one in Europe and one in Asia we have struggled
for decades to fight for women's rights
to fight for civil rights to end discrimination against the gay
community to create a nation
in which all people could live together with justice and we have had some good
successes over the years but where we have not succeeded is in the economic
struggle i want all of you never to forget
not only that you are living in the wealthiest nation in the history of the world but with so much new technology
out there the truth of the matter is that all people in America should have a
decent standard of living
we are we live right now with a corrupt
campaign finance system and the implications of that system is that
Congress day after day does things that the American people doesn't want it to
do and doesn't do what we want it to do and the reason for that is you have
these billionaires out there got Musk saying to the Republicans "If you vote against my tax breaks for billionaires
we're going to primary you we're going to throw you out of office." And on the Democratic party you got big fundraisers
say "If you stand up and vote for ending funding for
Netanyahu's horrible war in Gaza
We are going to primary you and right now right now you're seeing
cowardly members of Congress who are refusing to stand firm and say "No we
are not going to go to another war in Iran [Applause]
we got 800,000 Americans sleeping out on the street people can't afford food they
can't afford health care we do not have to spend billions more fighting a war in
Iran
but what that means is the most important political issue it's not a sexy issue
but it is enormously important we have got to end this disastrous Citizens
United Supreme Court decision
it is not a democracy when billionaires buy elections
and instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires which is what Trump wants
our demand is that when the rich have never had it so good they're going to start paying their fair share of taxes
there are millions of workers in this country who are trying to make it on 12
13 14 bucks an hour and I don't care where you live you can't make it on
those starvation wages we're going to raise that minimum wage to at least 17
bucks an hour
and what workers increasingly understand is they're not going to be able to
negotiate for decent wages decent benefits decent working
conditions without a trade union and that's why we got to make it easier for
workers to join unions
there are a number of Republicans who want to cut if you can believe it cut Social Security do you know what this is
again an unbelievable fact some 22% of seniors today in America are living on
$15,000 a year or less can anybody explain to me how anybody in
America let alone a senior can make it on $15,000 a year
nobody can nobody can so we're not going to cut Social Security our demand must
be to expand Social Security benefits by lifting the cap on taxable income
[Applause] and many years ago well not so many
years ago workers had what was called defined benefit
pension plans you know what that is what that means is you go to I know the younger people don't even know what this
is about but it means it means that workers in large corporations part of
you know their wage benefits and everything else was a guarantee guarantee that when you retired you left
the company you would get a pension you knew exactly what it was it was a
defined benefit pension plan and that is exactly what we have got to do right now
we got to strengthen social security but we have to make sure that every worker in America
has the kind of pension that he or she deserves
the United States of America today is the only major country not to guarantee
health care to all people do you know that one country I live love you to visit us
i live in Burlington Vermont 50 miles away from the Canadian border somehow
somehow in Canada and in countries all over the world they have determined that
healthc care is a human right not a privilege
[Applause]
the function of today's broken and cruel health care system is not to provide
quality care to all it is to make huge profits for the
insurance companies and the drug companies
and our job and this is not a radical idea it's not just candidates all over
Europe it's in countries in Latin America our job is to make sure that we have a
health care system that provides quality care to every man woman and child as a
human right
[Applause] and there's another issue coming down
the pike which is going to be a huge issue and that is the explosion of robotics and artificial intelligence
the reality is the reality is that most of the jobs that you guys have that
exist in America are not going to be there in 10 or 15 years they're going to be radically changed and right now we're
beginning to see the kinds of layoffs that I fear will happen now technology
and artificial intelligence and robotics are not bad unto themselves if you're
doing tra if you're doing dangerous work or dirty work and a machine comes in can
do that work for you there's nothing wrong with that the issue that we have
got to resolve is who benefits from this new technology
if worker productivity goes up because of this technology it must be workers
who benefit not just the owners of the corporations
and this is a huge issue that we're working on right now well let me just wind down my remarks and then I want to
take some questions or comments and just say this these are
tough times for our country and we are taking on when I call them oligarchs
these are people who have more wealth than you could imagine I mean they're not billionaires they're multi-billionaires
they have tens of billions of dollars and I think what we have to understand you know we are facing in this country
as all of you know serious problem in Vermont I'm sure it's here as well addiction drug addiction problems
problem right here overdoses and all that you We have people who are addicted to drugs we have people addicted to
alcohol etc etc what these people are addicted to on top and I mean this
seriously they are addicted to it they are addicted to greed
they want more and more everybody wants to live comfortably everybody wants to make money but the for these people
there is no end in sight they're prepared to destroy Social Security Medicare Medicaid in order to get even
more wealth and more power and the only way we stop them what they got is
incredible power unlimited resources they own the media etc etc but we have
one thing that they don't have we have the people [Applause]
but that doesn't mean anything if we are not organized what Trumpism is about by the way and
this is true of demagogues historically and all over the world right now you know how they flourish do you think
Trump and his friends are going to go around say vote for us so we can give massive tax breaks to billionaires and
cut Medicaid and a what they talking about all right what they do is come up
with quote unquote enemies often people who have very little political power who
are minorities this goes on all over the world it's always gone historically 40
50 years ago there were candidates running for office who says "Oh tell
white folks those black people are going to take your jobs folks those gay people are taking over
your school system jews are doing this latinos are doing that." They always pick on a minority group our job is to
break through that to bring our people together
and when we stand together we can win
but that is what demagoguery is instead of saying well you know what maybe the problem with America is the fact that
you are billionaires with uncontrollable greed who are prepared to destroy
working people to become even richer that's not what these guys are going to tell you they're going to say "Oh the
problem with America all these undocumented people and we got to get rid of them blah blah blah blah." All
right and we have got to bring our people to understand among other things
that during co you know who was picking the food and processing the meat and
were working in nursing homes it was undocumented people
and the answer is not to have ICE agents picking people up off the streets the
answer is comprehensive immigration reform and a path toward citizenship
[Applause] so these are tough times they're tough times in so many ways
but I believe from the bottom of my heart that if we stand together if we do not let Trump and his friends divide us
up by the color of our skin or where we were born or our sexual orientation if we stand together we can not only defeat
Trumpism we can in fact create the kind of nation
that the working families of this country deserve
all right I want to ask All right I want to
ask you a question right now and I'd like somebody raise their hand maybe come up here let's talk about
immigration let's talk about what's going on in Macallen who wants to come on up here and and say a few words on
that or raise their hands at least got a mic all right who wants to talk
about that danny danny okay right here all right we got a mic for you one
second okay hold the mic in your hand okay tell me
what's happening hold it hold he can hold it let him hold it can I He can hold it is that okay well Senator
Sanders first of all thank you so much for coming down to the border
um but to be real we're in we're in a state
of crisis i have personal friends family members there's a lot of us here but there are thousands of our friends and
family members that wouldn't even drive here because they're afraid to drive in the streets at night i know people
working domestic workers uh people that work in restaurants they're not showing up to work uh that have you know kids in
our public schools they're not sure if they're going to drive them to school this fall so I don't know if I have a
question but I just wanted to you really bring forward the urgency how scared people really are right now we didn't
really feel it into this this administration i know there's been a lot of talk about fear but it's really never been this urgent like this time around
and I'm wondering what we could do with senators like you like Greg Kazar what can we do to protect our people right
now i know there's a lot of know your rights movement going on but what can we do with leaders that have the power that
you do to start to to better protect our people in this moment of crisis well I think here's what I you know so I don't
have the magic answer but this is what I think first thought the American people are increasingly disturbed by what they
are seeing on their TV screens all right it's one thing to say "I am going to get
rid of a drug dealer or a violent criminal who came to this country illegally." And people say "Yeah that's
fine get rid of that person." It's another thing to go after somebody who's been working on a job paying taxes
working hard for 10 years and say "We're going to throw that person out."
And it's an interesting thing an interest some of you may have noticed it recently you have large employers in
agriculture and in meat processing they're saying to Trump "Do you know what you're doing you want to throw all
of these people out the price of food in America is going to double." That's what the employers are saying
because they know who is doing the work so I think the answer and again I am in
a minority on this but the answer has got to be immediately to stop this
business of people being arrested without due process
thrown into detention centers that is not I believe what most
Americans want and the polling is now becoming clearer by the way again what
they will use the rhetoric they will use is we're throwing out these violent criminals some people say "Good do it."
But when you go after people who have lived in this country for a long time worked hard pay taxes
live by the rules that is not working so well for Trump so we got to we got to figure out a way to stop ICE from what
they are doing as soon as possible all right other comments on this people
i want to say on this is I know as Danny mentioned this is very much on people's minds am I correct all right yes i see a
young man right here so I wanted to say thank you for coming
oh excuse me just give it to him he can hold it okay i just wanted to say thank you for coming down because many
politicians they can just um get elected and stay over there in office but I appreciate that you guys are from far
away and nonetheless coming down what my concern is that there's a lot of misinformation within the media that the
Republicans some of them who might want to stand up against uh against Trump are
afraid of it because he threatens them by saying that he's going to primary them yes the law firms as you mentioned
law firms that might be able to sue him are being silenced and so it's becoming
an autocracy where Trump has all power and my fear is that that what is it that
uh that we can do to stop that as as the people of the country and what is it that the government officials like
yourself that instead of it um being three separate branches it's becoming just himself controlling the other
branches what is it that maybe you guys can do to hold him accountable still this is I this is why I am here and
thank you very much [Applause]
you know I believe in democracy i really do in my heart of hearts you disagree with me that's fine that's what America
is supposed to be about make your point you want to run against me run against me but what you you're going to have to
move to Vermont to do that but that's all right but but what is happening now and this young
man made the point if you honestly if you are a Republican
member of Congress in Texas or any place else and in your heart of hearts you
understand how devastating these cuts to Medicaid would be right and you think it's really dumb to give tax breaks to
people who don't need it and you got up and you stood that the next day Elon
Musk or somebody else could say "You are finished politically we're going to primary you." And that is where we are
as a nation right now now the reason I am here and where we're going after we're here we're going to Louisiana i'm
going to be right in the district of the speaker of the house who helped write this bill
and believe it or not that guy represent it's not like he represents you know Speaker Johnson doesn't represent some
wealthy community he represents a low-income workingclass community and the reason I'm going why am I in Texas
why am I going to Louisiana why am I going to Oklahoma to tell people there to stand up and put pressure on their
elected officials [Applause]
so they're going to have to make a decision is it just their campaign contributions or are they going to have
to listen to people who understand what's going on and are going to throw them out of office if they do the wrong
thing so that's kind of what the reason you're asking me what I'm doing that's why I'm here is to mobilize people
uh in Texas Louisiana Oklahoma these are conservative states but my strong guess
you go out in Texas any place else and you say to people do you think it's a good idea to give tax breaks to
billionaires and cut Medicaid 80 90% of the people will say no but they don't
know what's going on and our job is to mobilize those people and that's what we're doing right now all right other questions on im Let's stay on
immigration for a moment if we can anyone else want to say a word i see a woman straight in front of me yes thank
you let's get a mic we'll get you a mic
just let her have it hello Senator Sanders thank you for coming to South Texas my name is Gabby Savaleta
and I would like to ask the Democratic Party to take the narrative of
immigration and to stand for us because we are
workers we're good people and if they do not take the narrative and start writing
immigration reform the Republicans are going to continue to call us names and
berate us and that's not fair so please tell the Democratic Party to stand up
and also take some of the risk along with us
thank you
thank you very much i mean I am as it happens I am an
independent the longest serving independent in congressional history
but I caucus with the Democrats and I'm part of the Democratic leadership i will convey
your feelings to the leadership but I'll tell you there is let me just say a word
on this one and maybe Kendall the new chair of the Democratic party here has
spoken about it it is no great secret that 40 50 years ago if you went out on
the street in Texas or Vermont and you said to people which political party represents the working class of America
no matter what their views are say well it's the Democratic Party who represents the wealthy and the powerful oh it's the Republican party but the Democratic
Party many decades ago had the brilliant idea that they would start accepting corporate money and over the years while
they were strong on issues like women's rights and civil rights and gay rights and the environment they in many ways
turned their backs on working families and all over this country people are
looking at the Democrats and they say "We don't believe a word you say anymore you talk and you talk but you don't
deliver and then they vote maybe they'll throw the dice and say I'm going to vote for a Trump what I am trying to do is
two things we are trying to bring about fundamental reform of the Democratic
party
and right now right now the Democratic Party it is no great secret is a
top-down party controlled by billionaires and controlled by these consultants who
live in another world they don't know a clue what's going on and our job is to force open you know the Democratic Party
is not supposed to be a private club and we got to break open that door and
come marching in as working people as young people or people of color and say
you know what this party belongs to us not just billionaires
all right look I want to again thank everybody for coming out i and I appreciate Danny's
point that we probably would have had twice as many people here tonight if people weren't afraid and I hate the
idea of people in this country being afraid being afraid to express their
views in Congress being afraid to walk the streets of Macallen that is not what this country is about
but we have gone let me just conclude by saying this again these are tough times
these are the most difficult times in the my lifetime and I'm older than most of you all right so I'm not going to
sugarcoat it these are tough times but despair is not an option that is
what they want us to do all right if we stand together look
you know the American people are decent people they care about each other the
vast majority are not greedy people who want it all go around Texas people think
that healthc care is a human right people think the minimum wage should be raised people think we get billionaire
money out of campaigns that's what most people think our job is to stand together right now
it's to take over the Democratic party it's to take on the greed of the billionaire class it's to create a
country of compassion and dare I say of love
rather than one of greed and I hate you because you came from a different
country or you're a different religion that is not what this country is supposed to be about we're going to turn
it around thank you all very much
to the people power to the people
power to the people power to the people
