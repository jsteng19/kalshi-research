thank you Iowa City you know when we were planning these events we had no idea how many people would show up and last night we were in Omaha and we had to turn away 800 people who couldn't get in and after I speak here I think for the first time in my political life I'm going to be running to another venue a block away to speak to another overflow crowd so thank you all for coming out let me thank Eima and Zach and Brian and Sandy and Patrick for all that they have said in defining why we are here today we are here today because under Trump our nation is facing a series of crises unprecedented in our modern history and what we do now in the coming days in the coming weeks and in the coming months will impact not only our lives but the lives of our kids the lives of our grandkids and in fact the very well-being of the planet in terms of [Applause] climate so if there has ever been a time in the modern history of our country to stand up and fight back now is that time and in my view and I say this with some knowledge and experience as a US senator Trump will not be defeated by politicians inside the DC Beltway for better or worse that is not going to happen it will only be defeated by millions of Americans in Iowa in Vermont in Nebraska in every state in this country who come together in a strong grassroots movement and say no to oligarchy no to authoritarianism no to kleptocracy no to massive cuts in programs that low income and working Americans desperately need no to huge tax breaks for the wealthiest people in this country [Applause] and that is why I am in Iowa today well thank you we're in this together today in America we are rapidly moving toward an oligarchic form of society where a handful of multibillionaires not only have extraordinary wealth but unprecedented economic media and political power as well if you want to know who is running the US government simply take a look at Trump's inauguration do you remember that for better or worse I was there right on the front row I got stuck there and standing right behind Trump as he was being sworn in were the three wealthiest people in America Elon Musk Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg those are the three right behind them and behind them were the mini billionaires you know they weren't worth hundreds of billions but there were 13 of those billionaires who were nominated by Trump to be major agency heads and when we talk about oligarchy I want you all to remember this in America today while the wealthiest people the 1% have never ever in the history of our country had it so good at the same exact time the working families of our country as you well know are struggling desperately to just make ends meet to put a roof over their heads to pay the rent to pay for health care to put food on the table to pay for child care pay for college and maybe maybe if you are an older worker in America 55 or 60 you're desperately trying to figure out how you're going to put aside a few bucks to retire with dignity that is the [Applause] reality in America today we have more income and wealth inequality than we have ever had three people those three people standing right behind President Trump own more wealth than the bottom half of American society 170 million [Applause] people top 1% now owns more wealth than the bottom 90% and while the very very wealthy become wealthier the reality facing ordinary Americans is somewhat different today 60% of our people in the richest country in the history of the world are living paycheck to paycheck do you all know what the expression paycheck to paycheck means all right I grew up in a family that lived paycheck to paycheck it meant that every week every month there were squabbles decisions had to be made how do you pay for the basic necessities many of you have grown up in families living paycheck to paycheck and living paycheck to paycheck is not only an economic struggle I want to tell you what it also is there's a fact that we don't talk about in American society in the media in Congress terribly much and that is we have one of the lowest life expectancies of any major country on Earth you all know that all right other countries living for five six years longer than we do but what is almost never discussed is that working class people in our country live six or seven years shorter lives than the very rich do you all know that why is that all right who said that who said that stand up well all right what does stress do to people all right what stress does to people and doctors know this is not any brilliant observation on my part or your part what stress does when you have to struggle every day to say oh my God my landlord's going to raise my rent by 20% what do I do I can't afford it what do I do with my kids my car broke down how the hell do I get to work and if I don't get to work because I can't afford the thousand bucks that it costs to fix my car I'm going to get fired if I get fired how do I survive oh my God my mother is ill what am I supposed to do she can't afford prescription drugs how do I pay for that right my kid got sick and I'm working how do I take off of work to take care of my sick kid if I'm going to get fired you add all of that up day after day year after year it wrecks people's minds it wrecks people's bodies and it causes them to die a lot earlier than people who do not have to worry about that economic pressure that's what's going on in America [Applause] today and while the very wealthiest people become wealthier 85 million Americans are uninsured or underinsured we spend twice as much per capita on health care as the people of any other nation but the function of our health care system is not to provide quality care to all it is to make the insurance companies and the drug companies enormously wealthy [Applause] we need the best educated workforce in the world and yet young people are going tens of thousands of dollars in debt in order to get the education that they need half of older workers half of older workers have nothing in the bank as they face retirement and unbelievable I did not know this I was chairman of the committee that deals with this stuff I had to learn about it 25% of senior citizens in America are now living on $15,000 a year or less now you tell me how anybody in America let alone a senior who often has health care needs other needs how do people survive on $15,000 a year so we are living in a society where the people on top make billions doing phenomenally well 25% of seniors living on 15,000 or less and we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on Earth we are going to change those priorities [Applause] and to show you to just discuss for a moment how obscene the level of oligarchy in America is today let me read to you what was reported in Bloomberg News just a few days ago quote Bloomberg News Elon Musk's net worth Tuesday's close is up more than 50% since the [Music] election first Tesla Incorporated surged then SpaceX became the world's most valuable tech startup and xAI nearly doubled its valuation before looking to do it again now X is looking to join Elon Musk's other companies quote in leveraging the billionaire's unprecedented political power end of quote but when we talk about oligarchy it is not just the massive amounts of income and wealth inequality that currently exists it's not just that we are living in two Americas people on top off doing their thing with incredible wealth tens of millions of people struggling that's not just what we're talking about when we discuss oligarchy what we are also talking about is that today the oligarchs have enormous political power as all of you know or should know we have a corrupt political system which as a result of this disastrous Supreme Court decision on Citizens United allows billionaires to literally buy elections you get one vote they buy elections Mr. Musk himself donated $270 million into Trump's campaign and his reward for that contribution is that he is now arguably the most important person in government more powerful than Trump further he is using his extraordinary wealth not only here in the United States but to support right-wing extremists all over the world including an extreme right-wing party in the election in Germany tomorrow this situation is so absurd this is how crazy the corrupt political system is in America now and Musk himself is so very arrogant that he is intervening getting involved in a Supreme Court election in the state of Wisconsin and he is supporting he is putting money against a candidate who has the very radical idea that women should be able to control their own [Applause] bodies but I want you all to think about it for a moment think about all that's going on in America he is so arrogant he's going to get involved in a Supreme Court election in one state and if he can get involved and win a Supreme Court election in one like what can he not win brothers and sisters that is not the democracy that men and women fought and died to [Applause] defend and I should point out that the role of billionaires in politics it's not just Musk it's others it's not just Republican billionaires it is Democratic billionaires it is the corruption of the two-party [Applause] system and that is why among many many other things we have got to overthrow this disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision and move to public funding of elections so in an America where the people on top are doing extraordinarily well while over the last 50 years you know why people in this country are angry over the last 50 years the average working people today are earning less in inflation adjusted wages than 50 years ago despite all of the increases in worker productivity and technology can you imagine that almost all of the new wealth that has been created has gone to the top 1% so that's the reality that we're in right now and I think about all of that when I think about all of the money going to the top working people struggling I remember the very profound and prophetic statement that President Abraham Lincoln made at Gettysburg in 1863 and it's funny every year I usually try to get to a parade in Vergennes Vermont it's a lovely parade on Memorial Day and they often the organizers of the parade bring up some high school kid who recites the Gettysburg Address and if you all remember what Lincoln did this was in 1863 terrible battle in Gettysburg thousands and thousands of soldiers killed trying to end the horror of slavery and Lincoln looks out in the battlefield and this is what he said and it's important to remember quote we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain that this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom and that government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the [Music] [Applause] earth and that is what we are fighting for a government of the people by the people for the people not a government of the billionaires by the billionaires or for the [Applause] billionaires but it is not just oligarchy as dangerous as that is it's not just oligarchy that we are fighting we are also fighting what is equally dangerous and that is Trump moving this country to authoritarianism some of you may have seen Trump recently posted a statement that said and I quote he who saves his country does not violate any law what does that mean it means essentially that Trump believes he can do anything he wants for any reason he can ignore Congress he can ignore the courts he is above the law and that's not just talk that is exactly how he has been behaving as many of you know Trump in violation of the Constitution and federal law is attempting to suspend all federal grants and loans and we've heard some of that from previous speakers that means he has tried to block funding and in some cases has blocked funding for Medicaid the Veterans Administration Head Start food stamps homeless veterans etc etc tens of millions of Americans some of the most vulnerable people in our country were impacted by that decision fortunately the American people have fought back and the courts have stopped him from doing his worst but as you heard he is still trying and in fact is throwing out federal workers illegally and unconstitutionally all over this country unconstitutionally he has dismembered agencies established by Congress you can't do that including USAID USAID helps to keep alive some of the very poorest children and people throughout the world that the richest person on earth is forcing children the poorest children to go hungry and unnecessarily die is a moral outrage Trump has dismembered the Consumer Financial Protection Board which has saved Americans billions of dollars from illegal corporate and banking activities he has even taken control over the Kennedy Center and now wants to take over the post office as well but it's not just usurping the power of Congress he is undermining and challenging the role of the federal courts I don't know if you have been hearing what Vice President Vance has been saying and what he has been saying is that despite 150 years of American jurisprudence Trump has the right to go forward regardless of what the courts say in other words according to Vance the courts do not have the right to stop unconstitutional acts of a president but it is not just in this march toward authoritarianism it is not just usurping the power of Congress and the courts what authoritarians do is they go after all forms of dissent starting with the media in an unprecedented way unprecedented he has forced ABC to a settlement with him for a TV story he did not like Meta which owns Facebook and Instagram has also had to respond and settle a lawsuit that he brought he has sued CBS's 60 Minutes for billions of dollars for another story he did not like during the campaign and incredibly he has sued the Des Moines Register your own paper here for the crime of doing a poll whose results he disagreed with and now now his FCC is investigating PBS and NPR so it is obvious what he is doing he is attempting to intimidate the media he is telling them that if you write a story or if you do an investigative piece that I don't like we're going to sue your company for billions of dollars so all over the country the people who own these media small papers whatever they say to their reporters hey you better think twice don't do that story we can't take a lawsuit even if we win it'll cost us millions of dollars in the courts that is what authoritarians do brothers and sisters we are also dealing with a new phenomenon which is the big lie I will not shock you to tell you that politicians occasionally lie always have but what you're seeing now is something that we really have never seen and that is the big lie saying something that is totally outrageous all right Trump continues to argue that the 2020 election that Biden won was stolen from him a big lie the January 6th 2021 insurrection was according to Trump a day of love climate change climate change is a hoax according to Trump originating in China and just the other day just the other day in a way that is going to impact the entire world Trump announced to the shock of everybody that it was Ukraine that started the war not his good friend Vladimir Putin that Zelensky is a dictator not Mr. Putin so brothers and sisters we have a lot on the table we've got to fight oligarchy we've got to fight authoritarianism we got to figure out how we deal with a big lie especially when that big lie gets out on platforms like Musk's Twitter which goes out to hundreds of millions of people and is repeated over and over again that's big stuff that we got to deal with but I want to talk to you for a moment about something that is very immediate and that is the so-called reconciliation bill that's a fancy term in Congress it's a big bill that the Republicans right now are working on and what that bill does is that at a time of unprecedented income and wealth inequality this legislation will provide over a trillion dollars in tax breaks to the billionaire class and the entire 1% it will make the very richest people in this country even richer and where does it get that money well it gets that money by cutting Medicaid housing nutrition education and the other basic needs and programs that working families depend upon we cannot allow that legislation to pass that is not what the American people want and in fact it's exactly the opposite of what the American people want I look at a lot of polls and what the American people say is don't give billionaires a tax break demand that they start paying their fair share of taxes and what the American people say very clearly is don't cut Medicaid or Medicare expand Medicaid or Medicare now one of the reasons that I was in Omaha last night in Iowa City now is that in both of those communities you have Republican members of Congress who won by relatively small margins in the House of Representatives right now the Republicans have I think 218 seats Democrats have 215 it's a three vote majority that means that if two Republicans tell their leadership that they are not going to slash Medicaid education and housing in order to give massive tax breaks to billionaires that legislation is defeated and what I'm asking you here in Iowa City is to tell your congresswoman to do just that vote no on this legislation if she does that and one other Republican does that that bill is [Applause] dead but brothers and sisters our job as difficult as it is is not just to defeat that legislation not just to take on oligarchy and authoritarianism and a culture of greed we've got to do more and what we have got to do is rally the American people to understand a very simple but profound fact we are the richest country in the history of the world we are not a poor country and in the richest country in the history of the world there is no rational reason why we are not providing a decent standard of living for every man woman and child in our nation that's not utopian thinking you know that is in fact what exists in a number of countries around the world in America we must establish that health care is a human right not a privilege it is not radical to say that every American regardless of income should be able to walk into a doctor's office and get the care that he or she needs it is not radical to say not radical to say that if you're struggling with cancer or some other terrible disease you should not go bankrupt or deplete your savings in order to pay the damn bills in the richest country on Earth every American worker is entitled to earn a decent standard of living we must raise the minimum wage in this country to a living wage at least 17 bucks an hour and at a time when millions of workers all over this country want to join unions because they understand that unions are the path to decent wages and benefits and working conditions we got to make it easier for workers to join unions by passing the PRO Act we should have in our country the best public educational system in the world we should be attracting the best and the brightest and paying them the salaries that they deserve no teacher no teacher should make less than $60,000 a year [Applause] we need to understand that the ages of 0 through four are the most important intellectually and emotionally for a human being which means we need high quality child care that is affordable for every American family [Applause] and we don't need our young people who are getting a higher education to come out of school $50,000 in [Applause] debt not a radical idea to expand the concept of public education and say that every public college and university in America should be tuition free [Applause] all over America certainly in my state of Vermont I expect here in Iowa people are having a difficult time paying for housing we desperately need to build millions of units of low income and affordable housing put millions of people to work doing [Applause] that and despite what Trump thinks we understand that climate change is an existential threat to this [Applause] planet and we're going to take on the greed of the fossil fuel industry who put their short-term profits ahead of the future of this planet and together we will not let Trump and his friends divide us up we are going to fight to abolish all forms of [Applause] bigotry this is a tough time it's a scary time for the country there is no denying it but what I want to do is to remind you that this is not the first difficult moment that our country has faced I want you to take a little tour with me on American history and I want you to think in a very serious way that back in the 1770s people throughout this country said you know what we're tired of the autocracy of the king of England yeah we know he is the most powerful person on Earth we know that he has the great Army great Navy but you know what we want our own independence and those guys and women put their lives on the line they took on the king of England people said you can't be done it's impossible they're too powerful they took them on they won don't forget that people said it was impossible but they did it and I want you to think about that when this country was formed it was only rich white men who had the right to vote and working people over the years that did not happen overnight people said you know what we want the right to vote as well and the fight for universal suffrage was not easy and people said it's impossible you know that's the way the system is rich people have the power they have the money they vote people fought it and over the years we had universal suffrage in 1920s women won the right to vote we look back on it now we say oh no big deal everybody has the right to vote trust me that was a huge struggle people had to overcome huge hurdles they won that [Applause] [Music] struggle and in the 1850s 1860s people stood up and said slavery is a moral outrage it must end in America and God knows how many tens of thousands of people fought and died to end slavery it was difficult but it was accomplished in the early part of this century workers who were exploited ruthlessly incredible hours fired arbitrarily dangerous jobs they said we want a union and the companies in some cases actually shot them beat them up you're never going to form a union we own this company we will tell you what to do they fought back and workers won the right to unionize for God knows how long how many decades women said we will control our bodies not the government and women won their right it's a right that Trump and his friends are trying to take away but we're not going to let them do that and in the 30s in the 1930s in the midst of a terrible depression Congress passed Social Security Medicare and over the years Medicaid minimum wage clean air and water standards people said you can't do that government can't do that people stood up and demanded it it happened now I say all of that to put it in a context yeah these are very very tough times we're taking on people with incredible wealth and power they own the media they own the political process and sometimes I know it can become overwhelming we can feel despair but in the past Americans stood up they fought back they won we can do the same thing [Applause] so let me conclude by saying that my coming here today is by no means the end of my involvement in these struggles here in Iowa and elsewhere in the next we are going to be in this full time in the next few days you'll be hearing from us by text and email and I'm going to ask you in those texts and emails to do just a couple of things first call your member of Congress to demand that she votes no on any bill that cuts Medicaid housing nutrition education or other basic needs in order to give tax breaks to the richest people in this country can you make that call secondly demand that your member of Congress hold a town hall meeting with you you know I love Iowa I've been all over the state and I'm happy to be with you today but I am not your Congress person bring your Congress person this looks like a beautiful room bring her here and ask her the questions and understand you know politicians can wiggle a little bit but be very clear will she vote no on the Republican reconciliation bill no tax breaks for billionaires and cuts to programs that working people need so brothers and sisters I honestly believe that we can take on Trumpism and defeat it we can we can [Applause] what the ruling class these guys don't become billionaires because they're dummies they're not they're very smart guys they work very hard and one of the things that they do which is very powerful and effective is they essentially get the word out in one way or another to the people of this country that says look we're multi-billionaires we own the media we own the political process we own the company that you work for we got the power you don't and there ain't nothing you can do about it your job is to work for us that's what your job is and they want to when they say those things implicitly what they are trying to do is demoralize the American people and make us feel hopeless oh God we can't do anything that's what they want you to believe it ain't true [Applause] if we do not allow Trump and his friends to divide us up by the color of our skin or our religion or where we were born or our sexual orientation if we stand together we win because at the end of the day I'm not a PhD in math but I do know that 99% is a hell of a larger number than [Applause] 1% so now is the time to go outside of our comfort zone now is not the time for despair for feeling helpless now is the time to stand up to fight back to take on Trumpism and not only to defeat Trumpism but to create the kind of great nation we know we can become thank you all very [Applause] much
