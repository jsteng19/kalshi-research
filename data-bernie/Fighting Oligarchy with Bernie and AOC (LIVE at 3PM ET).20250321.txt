you know I was told that you have a little bit over a 100,000 people in
gley and between the 6,000 who are
outside and the 4,000 who are
here and think we got 10% of the community at this rally right now thank
you now I want to say a word about
[Applause] Alexandria when Alexandria was a kid you
correct me if I'm wrong she cleaned uh houses with her
mom in order to make enough money for the family to survive and then after she graduated
college she was a barista working paycheck to
paycheck but what she did as she looked around her and in her community in Bronx
New York is she saw that change had to
come and so what she did is decided to run for Congress and people said what
are you kidding the guy who represents the district was one of the most powerful members of
Congress he had access to unlimited kinds of money how much money
did you have when we started you started none none all right but she put she did what
real politics is about real politics is not sitting at
million dooll fundraises it's working with people in your
[Applause] community and she worked
hard and her friends worked hard and she pulled off a major
[Applause]
upset and since then she has been a great member of Congress but not only
that she has been an inspiration to millions of young people all across this
country now the reason I say all of that is not just to praise Alexandra and I
love her but is to tell you and the people of
America that what Alexandria did you can do
there are millions of young people out there who love this country who are
disgusted with what they are
seeing who are prepared to get involved in the political
process so Alexandria thank you for being that inspiration
[Applause]
so so why are Alexandria and
I why are Alexandria and I here today
why we why will we be in Denver later this evening
why were we in Tempe last night where there was an unbelievable number of people coming out Las Vegas earlier than
that and we'll be in Tucson tomorrow why are we doing
that and we're doing that because this country faces a set of enormous crisis and how
we respond to this moment will impact not only our lives but the
lives of our kids future
generations and in terms of climate change will impact the future of this
[Applause] planet and what I have to tell you is
that given the huge turnouts we have seen already on this trip it is clear to me
that the American people are outraged at what's going
[Applause] on and the American people are saying
loud and clear we will not accept an oligarchic form of society
[Applause]
we will not accept the richest guy in the world running all over Washington
making cuts to the Social Security
Administration cuts to the veterans
administration almost destroying the Department of
Education all all so that they could give over a trillion dollars in tax
breaks to the wealthiest
1% but it's not just oligarchy we've got to deal with under Trump this country is
moving very rapidly to an authoritarian form of
society today we have a president who is undermining our constitution every
single day who is threatening freedom of speech
and freedom of [Music] assembly you know I look back at the
civics class that I took in the sixth grade a few years
ago and you probably took the same class we studied American history we studied
the Constitution and it's important to remember what we
learned back then and that is that the founding fathers of this country way back in the 1790s you know they had
fought a war against the all powerful King of England and the British
Empire and they're thinking how do we create a new country in which one person will never
ever have the kind of power that the king of England has
so with a lot of debate and these were really smart guys a lot of debate they
said you know what what we are going to do is create a government and a
Constitution which has a separation of [Applause]
powers and that means we're going to have a executive branch and a president
a lot of power we're going to have a congress a lot of power we're going to have a judicial branch a lot of
power and that is what they put together and that is precisely what Donald Trump
today is trying to
undermine First Amendment to the Constitution is the all important
freedom of speech [Applause]
and in a way that is unprecedented Trump is trying to
intimidate the media and anyone who speaks out against
[Music] them he loves the media when they th all
over him but like other cowards he can't
stand to be criticized [Applause]
Trump has sued ABC CBS meta and he sued
the de Mo register CU he didn't like a poll that they
did his FCC is now threatening to investigate PBS and
[Applause] NPR he has called CNN and
MSNBC illegal in other words the so-called
leader of the Free World is afraid of
[Applause] Freedom well Mr
President if you are too cowardly and too vain to accept criticism then get
out of
politics because that is precisely what democracy is
about that's what the beauty of democracy is about it's your ideas and my ideas and we argue about them and we
vote on them it's not do as I want or I'm going
to investigate you but it is not just the
media that he is going after he's going after the Constitutional
responsibilities of Congress Congress under the Constitution has the power of
the person and every day he is challenging that slashing funding without Authority
that only Congress can do trying to wipe out agencies that
Congress has created and only Congress can
eliminate but it's not only it's not only the media in Congress
that he is going after the third branch of government is the Judiciary and what they are supposed to do what the federal
courts do is rule on whether laws are constitutional in their judgment or not
what the president does con constitutional or not and there have let me tell you been
many decisions coming down from this supreme court that I
abhor their citizens united decision one of the worst decisions ever
rended their decision to overturn Ro v Wade a horrible
decision but those of us who live by the rule of law understand they have their
powers we have our powers but now for the first time what Trump is doing is
saying to a judge who issues a ruling we don't like that ruling we're going to
get you
impeached president Trump millions of Americans Millions
ions of Americans have fought and died to preserve American democracy we're not
going to let you take it away from [Applause]
us and we thank all of those veterans who put their lives on the line to
defend [Applause]
democracy but it's not just all ol Archy and authoritarianism that is on our minds
all over this country people are standing up and they're saying we will not accept a society of massive income
and wealth [Music] inequalities a society in which the very
rich are getting much richer while millions of working families are
struggling to put food on the table
and what people are saying is that in the richest country in the history of the world we are going to fight for and
create an economy and a government that works for all of us not just the 1%
[Applause]
all right I'm going to do something radical now you ready all
right I'm going to tell you the truth I know pretty radical but what the
hell only go around once that I I want to take a few minutes
to describe to you what is really going on in this country and it's something
you don't see much in the corporate media and you certainly don't hear discussed in the halls of Congress and
that that is in America today we have two separate
Americas on one hand we have an America
in which the wealthiest people have never ever in the history of our country
had it so good today we have more income and
wealth inequality than we have ever had today
we have three multi-billionaires Mr musk Mr Bezos Mr
Zuckerberg these three combined these three combined own more wealth than the
bottom half of American society 170 million
[Applause] Americans now we don't talk about it much for obvious reasons
but the idea that so few have so much and so many have so little is not what
this country is supposed to be [Applause]
[Applause] about and further let's take a look at concentration of ownership in the
economy you know what we hear kids read in school books we are a society people go out and they SL their own small
businesses free Enterprises great everybody competes against each other that ain't the case today you have more
concentration of ownership in America than we have ever had in the history of this country in sector after sector
whether it is agriculture Transportation media Financial Services what you have
is a small number of extraordinarily large corporations who charge on
outrageous prices for the products that we have to buy let me mention just one example of
concentration of ownership today nobody talks about it today you got three Wall
Street firms Black Rock Vanguard and State Street you ever hear of these
companies combined combined these three investment firms are the
majority stockholders in 95% of American
[Music] corporations and these guys I want to tell you something because I bump into
them in my line of work they are not nice
guys I know on TV they come across and in your community they make a donation to the hospital to the Boys and Girls
Clubs or to the Food Shelf they're just they're just very nice but they're not
you know in America today as I think all of you know sadly and tragically and we got to deal with it we have major
epidemics dealing with addiction I think we lost a 100,000
Americans last year because of drug overdoses serious problem in my state we have people addicted to alcohol
serious problems with alcoholism we have people who were addicted to Tobacco my father smoked two packs of cigarettes a
day and he died before he was 60 people addicted to food but I will tell you
this in the midst of all of these addictions the worst and most dangerous
addiction we have is the greed of the [Applause]
oligarchs now everybody wants to do well in life everybody wants to make money
but you would think that if you had a few billion dollars or 10 or 20 billion
doar you would not feel obliged to step on the backs of poor people to become
even [Applause]
richer but that is exactly what they are doing right now they are prepared to
destroy Social Security Medicaid medic care the Veterans Administration in
order to make themselves even richer and these guys have no sense of
what goes on in the real world they live in another planet they own Mansions all
over the world they go on vacations to their own private islands when they want to go someplace
they don't go into the car they go into the planes or the helicopters that they own send their kids to the best private
schools and colleges that is their world let me tell you about another world the
other America that we don't talk about and that is today in the richest country
in the history of the world 60% of our people are living paycheck to
paycheck you all know what paycheck to paycheck is some of you live in paycheck to
paycheck I grew up in a family live paycheck to
paycheck know a little bit about that and what that means is people today are
wondering how are they going to pay their rent if their landlord raises the rent by
20% how are they going to pay $20,000 a year for child care when they're only
making $50,000 a year people want to buy decent good
quality food for their kids walk into a grocery store can't afford that food
because the prices of food are Skyhigh people get sick their kids get
sick they are uninsured or underinsured and they're saying how in God's name am I going to be able to take my kid to the
doctor's office at the end of the month people have thousands of dollars in
credit card debt paying 20 30% interest rates how the hell do I pay those rates
and what happens what happens if my car breaks down something as simple as that
happens every day and I go to the car shop and the guy says a th000 bucks get
it fixed I don't have the thousand bucks what do I do what do I do if I can't get my car
and I can't get to work and if I can't get to work I get fired and if I get fired how do I take care of my
family you know why the American people people are angry and they are angry all over this country they are angry because
believe it or not despite a huge increase in worker productivity over the
last 52 years if you could believe it real inflation accounted for wages today
are lower than they were 52 years [Music] ago meanwhile there has been a75
trillion doll transfer of wealth from the bottom 90% to the top
1% that is what a riged economy is about and that is what we are going to
[Applause]
change so let's also take a look at other aspects of American society
anybody here think our Health Care system is working well [Music]
it is a broken and dysfunction and dysfunctional and cruel Health Care
System we are spending twice as much per capita on health care we're spending
$144,000 for every man woman and child yet 85 million are uninsured or
underinsured do you know what underinsured means how many people here have high
deductibles what kind of DED cable do you have ma'am do you know $7500 what do you
got how much [Music]
$20,000 deductible what do you got, 9,000,000
8,000 7,000 all right what does all of that mean it means that even though you
have insurance when you get sick you still can't afford to go to the doctor
how insane is that and you know what the result is we don't talk about it much
60,000 Americans die each year because they don't get to a doctor on time
because they're uninsured or they're underinsured and I want to I want to
deal with another issue you'll excuse me for being professorial here and a little
bit boring [Applause]
but it's important that we know this and here's again a fact never very rarely
talked about right here's the fact despite spending so much on Healthcare
our life expectancy how long we live is about four years younger four years
shorter than other major countries that's bad that is bad but I want to tell you what is even worse and I want
you all to think about it and help me out here if you are working class in America
you will live on average about seven or eight years shorter lives than if you
are wealthy in other words being working
class in America is a death sentence all right
question why is that why is that raise your hand tell me why yes Ma'am
why stress all right stress all let me deal with that all
right the woman here said stress and she's absolutely right what
kind of stress are working class people living under today who wants to help me out on
that one and a I can't get you all yes I see a handed ma' survival okay stress means you're trying
to survive every week okay more ma'am I own a small business and I can't
corporations to pay the bills I own a small business and I can't
get corporations to pay dash dash their bills yes ma'am Financial stress
Financial stress yes ma'am taxes tuition
tuition y where you back there ma'am what safety okay
yes what dental dental work thank you for raising
that issue anybody have a problem with the cost of dental care in America bloody
right all right other issues yeah I see a have young man back there yeah work safety workplace safety okay
yes ma'am mental health mental health all right look we can all right we can spend two hours going on
here all right but but here is the bottom line when you are struggling paycheck to
paycheck you are worried about how you survive every single week and doctors
call this almost the physiology of poverty that stress that you live with
24 hours a day eats away at your body and your mental health and that is the
major reason why Working Class People are dying s years earlier than the
rich it is a shame but it's more than a shame it is
[Applause]
unacceptable and the point that I want all of you to get ingrained in your heads look if we were a poor country
country like Haiti a really poor country I would say to you well I'm sorry you don't have good health care sorry you
don't have good dental care sorry you don't can't send your kids to college we're a poor country we can't afford it
brothers and sisters we are the richest country in the history of the
world there is no excuse for Working Class People Dying seven years earlier
than the rich [Applause]
there is no excuse that one out of four Americans cannot afford to
fill the prescriptions that their doctors's right for prescription
drugs there is no excuse that in the richest country on
Earth 800,000 Americans are home list and 20 million people including people
in this room paying 40 50% of your incomes for
housing no excuse no excuse that our child care
system is a disaster outrageously expensive while workers there are being paid low
wages no excuse that our public schools are struggling trying to get teachers no
teacher in America should make less than $60,000 a [Applause]
year so My Friends why is all of this happening why is it that the rich get
richer and working class people die younger than they should well it has
everything to do with the fact that we're living in an oligarchic form of
society you know I've been talking about that for a few years but I think the rest of the world
is catching on to what I was talking [Applause]
about and the reason is you got to be dumb and blind not to see what's going
on you got a president Trump getting inaugurated and I must tell you one of the more bizarre experiences of my life
was I was kind of pushed to the front row of that and there I am there's Trump and
right behind them you got musk Bezos and
Zuckerberg three wealthiest guys in the country and then behind them you got 13
other billionaires who Trump nominated to head up various government
agencies you know Abraham Lincoln talked about a government of the People by the
people for the [Applause] people well Trump has a government of
the billionaires by the billionaires and for the [Music] [Applause]
billionaires and what these guys are busy doing right now is going after
Medicaid going after Social Security going after nutrition Rich want to get richer and
they don't care who they step on now it is
imperative that we fight Trump every step of the way and by the way by the
way it is not just on domestic issues this country has a
250e history and never before have we had a president Ally himself with a
terrible dictator like Vladimir Putin
[Applause] and on top of that and on top of that Trump wants to continue the
disastrous policies of the Biden Administration and provide more funding
for the neon Yahoo government to destroy the people of
[Applause] Kasa all
right our job though is not just to play defensive we've got to get on the
offensive as [Applause]
well and that means having a vision of where we as the wealthiest Nation on
Earth the longest standing democracy on the planet where do we want to go what kind of nation do we want to become and
for a thought the profound issue that must be dealt with is we must end this
corrupt campaign Finance [Applause]
system now I don't care if you're a republican Democrat or independent I
don't think there's anybody who thinks it vaguely makes sense that the richest guy in the world could spend $270
million to get Trump elected and then become the most powerful person in the government
it's not just Republicans let's be clear billionaires are funding the Democratic
party and preventing that party who standing up for Working
Families bottom line we need to end citizens united move to Public Funding
of [Applause]
Elections Trump wants to give massive tax breaks to billionaires our of you
it's time that the billionaires started paying their fair share of [Applause]
taxes Republicans refuse to raise the minimum wage we want to raise that
minimum wage to a living wage at least 17 bucks an
hour musk and Bezos and others want to break unions we believe in the Trade
union movement
workers all over this country want to Joy in unions they're being stopped by the illegal activities of Corporations
we've got legislation in that will end that let's pass the
[Applause] proac Trump and his friends want to cut
Social Security we're going to expand Social Security by lifting the
[Applause] cap Trump and his friends want to cut
Medicaid well we got a different idea we're going to join the rest of the industrialized World guarantee
Healthcare to all it's a human
right we're going to fight and past Medicare for all single
[Applause] pay in a competitive global economy we
need the best educated Workforce in the world
young people should not go broke or in debt because they want to go to college or a trade
school we desperately need doctors and nurses and teachers and
carpenters and Sheet Metal Workers and construction
workers we need to make sure our people get educated without going into death we
need to make our public colleges universities and community colleges tuition [Applause]
free we need to save the
planet and create millions of good paying jobs by Transforming Our Energy
System all right we need an EMT [Applause] please all right we got a we got a
medical issue medical
issue somebody fainted all right we need some help here please
security all right all right they're on the way from the back let's take a break for a moment
what are we okay okay good all right thank
[Applause]
you you know Trump and his friends talk about
Freedom well in a free Society we must absolutely guarantee that it is the
women of America who control their own bodies not the government
[Applause]
[Music] look let me end on this note and the
note is that this is a very difficult time in the history of our country it's
not the first difficult time that we had remember we've gone through a civil
war we've gone through slavery we've gone through workers trying to form
unions and getting beaten up and killed we've gone through a depression we've gone through 1941 being
attacked and not knowing how to respond we've gone through a lot of things but
this is what I believe the essence of I think what we are about and that is if
we stand together if we care about each other if you care about my family and I
care about your
family if we don't believe that the goal in life is just to make billions and
step on other people and to lie cheat and steal if we believe that love and
compassion is what motivates us [Applause]
now if there are some Republicans here Republicans watching and on the live stream Republicans did not vote for
Donald Trump in order to give tax breaks to billionaires and cut Social Security believe me they
didn't and the reason that Trump has been successful and why demagogues around the world are successful you know
what they do they play one group off against another they're telling you who
you're going to hate and our job is to do exactly the
[Applause]
opposite the right wi wants to divide us up based on the color of our skin or
where we were born or our religion or our sexual
orientation and our job is to come together
now I don't have a [Music] PhD in mathematics but I do know this
that 99% is a hell of a lot larger number than [Applause]
1% so if we stand together are strong
are disciplined are smart I have every every every reason to believe deepest
deeply in my heart that not only will we defeat trumpism but we can create the
kind of nation that we deserve thank you very
[Applause]
much brother everybody together [Music]
right
