unbelievable I want to say you when you run for president two times you do a lot
of pries in fact we were here some years ago right here and we had a great rally
I think we had about 10,000 people out in the hundreds of r that I have
done we have never ever had a rally as large as
[Applause]
[Music] this your
presence your presence here today is not just significant for Colorado you are
sending a profound message all over the
world the whole world is watching and they want to know if the
people of America are going to stand up to trumpism oligarchy
[Applause]
now I want to say this the reason Alexandria is with me today is not just
that she is doing a great job representing her District in the
Congress it's more than that she has become an inspiration for millions of
young people
[Applause]
when she was a kid she worked with her mom cleaning houses in order to help the
family survive before she ran for
congress she was a barista
has not forgotten where she came
from but more importantly more importantly when she
decided to run she was taking on one of the most
powerful members in the Democratic [Music]
party and everybody said you're crazy how are you going to beat this guy maybe
a future leader of the democratic party she had no money she had no political
experience but what she did is what all of us have got to
do she went out and worked with her friends that she raised a few th000 and
she worked hard and in a disciplined way what Alexandria did is what millions of
Americans can do
we can organize at the Grassroots level we can become strong trade
unionists we can run for school board or president of the United
States we're not going to let the billionaire class have all of the Power
[Applause] so the message today is yes here in Colorado in Vermont
in New York all over this country hey Mr Trump people fought and died to create a
Democratic Society you're not going to take away
[Music] from hey Mr President turn off Fox TV
and take a few moments to read the Constitution of the United
States and when I was in elementary school we learned about how the government was formed the Constitutional
Convention and all that stuff I should have studied it harder but Trump should have learned it in the first
place and what we got is a separation of powers
and you know why because the people who founded this country took on the most
powerful person in the world at that time the king of
England and they said we never want to have one person in this country who has
all of the Power like the king of England so they created a government
with an executive branch a legislative branch and a judicial branch
and what Trump is doing every single day in an unconstitutional way is trying to
undermine the powers of congress undermine the First
Amendment you got a president who is suing ABC and CBS and matter the the boy
register he is threatening he is threatening to investigate PBS and
[Music] NPR he Lov media that forms on him that
tells him how great he is well I got news to you Mr President what democracy
is about is people discussing issues debating issues and disagreeing with
you and a than the criticism get the hell out of
politics what this this moment is about why we here today is we will not allow
America to become an
oligarchy this nation was built by working
people and not going let a handful of billionaires run the
government you know a few years ago when I used the word oligarchy
people didn't know what I was talking about well they know what I'm talking about
now you got to be dumb blind and deaf not to see what's going
on Trump gets inaugurated and I had the unusual position I don't know how it I
got right on the front row so there it was watching the SE
right behind Trump were the three wealthiest people in the
country at [Music]
Zuckerberg nominated to run major government agencies
so any working person in this country who thinks that these billionaires are
simply trying to make government more efficient you don't know what you're
see now you know in Colorado and Vermont all over we have a serious problem with
people who are addicted right we got a serious drug problem we got an alcohol
problem we we have tobacco problems we have people who are addicted to one thing or another but I will tell you
what I think the worst Addiction in this country is the most dangerous and that
is the greed of the
alant you everybody wants to do well we all want to make money we all want to
live comfortably that's natural that's right but these guys already have
billions tens of billions hundreds of billions how much money do you
need and right now what these holar are doing is they're going after Social
Security they're going after [Music] Medicaid they are trying
to destroy the Veterans Administration [Applause]
veterans put their lives on the line to defend this
country and you don't fire 83,000 workers at the
VA those will mean worst Quality Health Care for our
veterans and you know what is almost unimaginable and this is what greed is about like I her at it you I need it
more and more and more they want to cut nutrition programs for
Hungry kids you tell me in what world in what
Universe in what religion is taking food away from Hungry
children and giving tax breaks to the rich vaguely
more but it's not just horrendous domestic policies that Trump and his
billionaire friends are pushing on us for the first time in the
250e history of this country we have a president of the United States who is
allying himself with a horrible dictatorship in
Russia we have a President Who Lies all of of the time and one of his worst lies
was that he says Ukraine started that [Applause]
war well Mr President Russia and Putin started that
war and we're not going to lie ourselves with dictatorships because we believe in
democracy but it is not just Russ Trump was to continue the horrific
Biden policy of giving more money to Netanyahu to destroy
the we are going to bring we are going to bring legislation to the floor very
shortly which says not a nickel more for Nyah
brothers and sisters brothers and sisters there is today there is today profound disgust at
both political parties people see a Republican party in
which must the wealthiest guy in the world spent $270 million to elect Donald
[Music] Trump and his reward is is to become the
most powerful person in the [Applause] government now I don't care if you're a
Conservative Republican or anybody else nobody thinks that is what America is
supposed to be about but I would not be telling you the truth if I didn't tell you that within
the Democratic party there are billionaires who have unw
influence and there is a reason why for the last 30 or 40 years
Democrats have turned their backs on the working class of this
country so when we talk about where we are and where we've got to go maybe most
importantly is we got to get rid of this damn citizens united Supreme
Court democracy is one person one vote not billionaires buying
elections I want all of you to know corporate media doesn't talk about it we don't see it in Congress much the agenda
that we as progressives fight for for the working class of this country is an
enormously popular agenda Republicans supported Democrats
Independence supported everybody body knows that the current health care
system is broken it's dysfunctional everybody knows that the
function of the system today is to make huge profits for the drug companies and
the insurance companies and everybody knows there is something wrong when we are the only
major country on Earth not the guarantee Health Care to all
people so Alexandria and I and others are going to work with you to finally do
what should have been done decades ago pass a Medicare for all
single St burning not burning I got bad news for you it's
[Music] h no right
now we have in Washington an embarrassing minimum wage federal
minimum wage of 7 and A4 an hour and that means that tens of
millions of Americans are working for starvation wages together we're going to raise that
minimum wage to a living wage 17 bucks an hour
all over this country workers want to join
unions we got any Trade union is here today all
right and workers though that if you're in the union you're going to get better wages working conditions and benefits
but corporations are trying to stop workers illegally trying to stop workers from joining Union that's why we're
going to pass the pro act make it easier for workers to join [Applause]
you're in the absurdity of Americans paying in some cases 10 times more for
prescription drugs than people in other [Applause]
countries and Donald Trump may think that climate change is a
[Music] hoax we know it is an existential threat
to our planet and that is why we're going to pick up where Alexandria left off we're going to
pass a green jobs program we cre millions of jobs
Transforming Our Energy System away from fossil
fuel and in a competitive global economy we need the best educated Workforce in
the world it is totally insane that young people
who want a good education go 50 100,000 of that we are in desperate need of
doctors and nurses and dentists and Mental Health
Counselors if you come from a working class family you want to go to Medical store you going to come out of half a
million in debt that's insane we got to make public colleges and universities
tuition [Applause]
free I not of this stuff is radical the American people support
this they don't want tax breaks for billionaires they want programs that
help ordinary Americans to the point that Alexandria
made a few minutes ago is exactly the right point and that he is
what the right wing wants us to do is to turn on each
other they wanted to bide us up by the color of our skin or where we were born
or what our religion is or what our sexual orientation is that's how they win they divide us up
now I'm not a mathematician but I do know that 99% is a hell of a bigger number than 1
% and I do know that if we stand together we are
the best majority of people we can defeat
trumpism we can create a political movement so that we have a government
and economy that works for all of us not just the 1%
brothers and sisters this is a difficult moment in American history it's not the
first difficult moment we have had we've gone through some rough period in the past as well but what I believe from the
bottom of my heart if we stand together we don't let them to divide us up if we
are smart if we're willing to go outside of our comfort zones there is nothing
nothing that can't stop us let us go for
[Applause]
oh [Applause]
