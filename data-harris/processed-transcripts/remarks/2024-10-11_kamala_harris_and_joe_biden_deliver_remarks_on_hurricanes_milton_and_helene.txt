Mr. President.

Sure.

Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you to -- to all of the men and women represented at the agencies that are represented by the members of the president's cabinet for the work that they've been doing around the clock. In the wake of Hurricane Milton, we have, of course, witnessed widespread devastation.

Homes and neighborhoods have been severely damaged. Millions of people are without power and thousands without clean water. To the people of Florida and -- you must know -- and to the -- all of those in the region, our nation is with you. We see your incredible strength and resilience, and we are working around the clock to keep you safe.

We continue to coordinate resources with local and state authorities, including food, water, medical supplies, and generators, and we will continue to work with the teams on the ground to restore water and power as quickly as possible. In the coming days and weeks, President Biden and I will make sure that the communities that are there on the ground and have been affected will have the resources they need, not only to respond to the storm, but also to recover.

And we will continue to keep communities in Florida, Georgia, North and South Carolina, and across the southeast ensured that they will recover from Hurricane Helene. Finally, I will say once again, as Secretary Mayorkas and I have discussed, to any company or individual that is using this crisis to jack up prices through illegal fraud or price gouging, whether it be at the gas pump, the airport, or the hotel counter, we will be monitoring and there will be a consequence.

The bottom line is this. We are in this for the long haul and the support and the coordination between the federal, state, and local authorities and leaders has been extraordinary and will continue for as long as it takes. I thank you all.
