Well, you know, also a lot of Thai recipes like a lot of Southeast Asia use nuts as part of  Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah.

Oh, really.

OK.  tables here?

Yeah. And you have like regulars that come all the time.

Right, right. So, this is what small businesses -- right. It's like you know who your regulars are. You know when I'm having a good day, when I'm having a challenging day, right? You know what they like to order.

But you have to be -- I'm telling you. This is one of my single priorities is to invest and grow our small businesses. So, what I'm going to be rolling out next week is basically a tax credit for start-ups, for small businesses. We're starting -- half of America's working population either owns, runs, or works in a small business.

But about business and about community, right?

Well -- so, my second mother who taught me how to make gumbo, she didn't have a restaurant, but she had a small business. She was -- she had a day care center. And she would, you know -- the local mother or father who was having challenges, she would come and take care of them. It's up and down. She was a matriarch of the community. She would hire locally. She would, you know, scold and discipline everybody's children.

But it was part of the community, right? It's what holds the community together.

Right.

You did? You do?

OK. Where is your cookbook?

OK. Well, see. There you go.

OK. I'm going to find it. OK.
