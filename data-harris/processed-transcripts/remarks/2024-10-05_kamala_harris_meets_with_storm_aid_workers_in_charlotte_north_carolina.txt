And then, yet, you're still here helping people --

Right?

Right.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Well, I'm going to get in line so I can help do the work.

But -- but we're here for the long haul.

OK?

We're here for the long haul. And I've been meeting with the governor, and we've got the administrator for FEMA's here on the ground. And just -- and the mayor was there in the meeting, as well as Mayor Lyles. And we're putting just all hands on deck --

To make sure that you and your family and your neighbors and everyone have everything that they need in the --

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

That's right.

That's right.

And you are -- what a hero you are --

While you've been so directly affected --

Helping other people, right?

So, you have different sources of donations, right?

For this effort.

And then, how do -- how do you actually then centralize it?

And bring it all together.

And then, you have these production lines --

And then, how do we get the packages out?

Yeah.

Right. It's not filtered through any --

So, you get it directly to individuals?

So, what's that been like?

Really?

So, they didn't even have a center of where to do it because you were the only one.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah. That's true.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

That's

That's right.

Well, you all are the heroes among us because I do believe, in moments of crisis, the heroes are revealed, who just step up to help people in need and -- and to show that kind of strength that -- that people need to feel in each other.

Yeah, that's really important.

Yeah.

Yeah.

So, so far, their -- probably the needs are pretty consistent, right? Or are you saying --

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Right.

Yeah.

You know, part of the announcement I made today includes $100 million in federal money going to rebuild.
