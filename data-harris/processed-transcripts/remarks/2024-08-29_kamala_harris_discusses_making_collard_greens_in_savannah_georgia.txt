Bacon.

I do bacon.

Garlic. I put white vinegar. I do.

So, I start with -- I slice up my garlic.

But no. First, I fry -- I chop up the bacon.

And get all that fat going. Then I put garlic.

Some chili peppers.

And then a lot of water and some -- a little chicken stock.

And I let it go for a while before I put the greens in.

And then -- right? So, you get that going and all that flavor. And then I put the greens in for a couple of hours.

Then I do vinegar, and then I cheat and do a little Tabasco.

Yeah.

Because -- but Tabasco of all. Like I like Louisiana hot sauce, but Tabasco has that right amount of vinegar.

Yeah. And that's -- so, that's how I do my greens.

Uh-huh.
