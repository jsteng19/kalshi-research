I started the debate by talking about it and it became apparent, I think, throughout that hour and a half. Look, this is very much two different visions for our country.  Ours, which is a vision for the future.  And his speeches about the past and taking us backward.

And as I said on the debate stage, we are not going back.  This is a campaign born out of love of country. We love our country. We believe in who we are. We believe in the American people. This is a campaign about bringing folks together, knowing the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us.

It is about inclusion, and it is not about division, and it is not about demeaning and name calling. It is about lifting folks up, working folks, families, children, people who are just not just trying to get by, but trying to get ahead. That's what we stand for. So, let's get out of here for these next 56 days.

Hard work is good work, and we will win. We will win. See you later.
