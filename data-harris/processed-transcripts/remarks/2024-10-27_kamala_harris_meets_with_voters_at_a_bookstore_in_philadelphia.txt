You're 11, right. So, help me figure out a book for eight-year-olds. What's the best book for an eight-year-old who reads a lot? And then a six-year-old.

A girl. My baby niece reads a lot. She's a voracious reader. So, I need an eight-year-old and a six-year-old.

OK. That's good. OK.

Oh, this is going to be great because she really wants a dog, and her parents  are getting one right now. OK. What else? What else?

For an eight-year-old or a six-year-old?

Is this for a six-year-old?
