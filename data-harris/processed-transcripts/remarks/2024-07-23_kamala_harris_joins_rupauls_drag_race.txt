Hi everyone, it's Kamala Harris. Each day, we are seeing our rights and freedoms under attack, including the right of everyone to be who they are, love who they love, openly and with pride. So as we fight back against these attacks, let's all remember no one is alone.

We are all in this together, and your vote is your power. So please make sure your voice is heard this November and register to vote at vote.gov.

Now, on with the show.
