And I think that what -- they both, as leaders who are well-respected, are making an important statement that it's okay and -- if not important to put country above party. And I'm honored to have their support, and I think it's an important statement right now.

A lot of what I think is happening -- and I was just talking with some folks here in Pittsburgh about it -- is that people are exhausted about the division and -- and the attempts to kind of divide us as Americans. And them stepping up to make this public statement, I think, is courageous, but also, for people like the folks I was just talking with, it really reenforces for them that we love our country, and we have more in common than what separates us.

Yes, I am. Yes.
