Congratulations.

Oh, well, first of all, I've just heard so much about you and this beautiful place that you have created and all your --

I was trying to bust into the kitchen.

Hi.  look at that

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. It's good to be with you. Thank you. Thank you.

and to all the volunteers, I just wanted to come by and say thank you thank all, UFCW, everybody who is here, for all the work you've been doing.

You know, ours -- as we talk about it, because it's just what it is, we are a people-powered campaign. And it is about understanding the power of each one of us to lift folks up, to let them know they are seen, they are heard. I think there's so much that has happened in our country that makes people feel like they're alone or they're not seen or that we have nothing in common when, in fact, we all know we have so much more in common than what separates us.

But you guys are doing the work on the ground, and I cannot thank you enough. We -- I was just with Governor Walz -- Coach Walz. He just left. He's moving up on to -- to North Carolina. But he sends his greetings as well, as does our president. But thank you all.

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
