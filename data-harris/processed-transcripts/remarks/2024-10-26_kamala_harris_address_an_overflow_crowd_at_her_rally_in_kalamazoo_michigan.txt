Hi, everybody.  Can we hear it for Michelle Obama?  Oh, good

Thank you all. Michigan! Michigan!  All right, gu- -- we've got 10 days to go. And the thing that I love about everybody here is we love hard work. Hard work is good work. And we are going to win. We are going to win. And it's going to be close, and we know that, and we know the stakes. And we also are here together because we love our country and we are prepared to fight for the best of who we are.

Many of you've heard me talk about this: We're not fighting against something; we're fighting for something. And through our campaign -- our campaign -- yes, we will win. That is our highest and that is our achievable goal. We will win.

And in the process, over these next 10 days, we are also doing the work of building community, building coalitions, reminding folks that we are all in this together, lifting each other up, reminding ourselves and each other that we have so much more in common than what separates us. That's what our campaign is about.

It is a people-powered campaign. And because it is a people-powered campaign, we will win, because we know what we stand for, so we know what to fight for. And when we fight --

-- we win. God bless you. I'll see you soon.
