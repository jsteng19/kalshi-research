Our administration worked on the most significant border security bill in decades. Some of the most conservative Republicans in Washington D.C. supported the bill, even the Border Patrol endorsed it.

But at the last minute, Trump directed his allies in the Senate to vote it down.

He tanked tanked the bipartisan deal because he thought it would help him win an election which goes to show Donald Trump does not care about border security. He only cares about himself.

I was the attorney general of a border state in that job. I walked underground tunnels between the United States and Mexico on that border with law enforcement officers. I went after transnational, gangs drug cartels and human traffickers that came into our country illegally.

I prosecuted them in case after case and I won. So here is my pledge to you as President. I will bring back the border security bill that Donald Trump killed and. I will sign it into law and show Donald Trump what real leadership looks like.
