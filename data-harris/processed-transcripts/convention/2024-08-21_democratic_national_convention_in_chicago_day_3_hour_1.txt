Donald Trump said he wants to punish women and as a result of his actions today in America, one out of three women live in a state with a Trump abortion ban, one out of three. Some of these bans go back to the 1800s even before women had a right to vote.  Think about that. Well, Tim and I have a message for Trump and others who want to turn back the clock on our fundamental freedoms.

We're not going back.
