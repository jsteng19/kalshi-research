Okay. Hi, guys.

Next week, and it'll be focused on the economy and what we need to do to bring down costs and also strengthen the economy overall.

You know, yet again, there are far too many civilians who have been killed. I mean, Israel has a right to go after the terrorists that are Hamas. But as I have said many, many times, they also have, I believe, an important responsibility to avoid civilian casualties.

Yeah.

Well, look, first and foremost -- and the president and I have been working on this around the clock -- we need to get the hostages out. We need a hostage deal, and we need a ceasefire. And I can't stress that strongly enough. It needs to get done. The deal needs to get done, and it needs to get done now.

Yeah.

I couldn't agree -- disagree, excuse me, more strongly. The Fed is an independent entity and, as president, I would never interfere in the decisions that the Fed makes.

Well, as we know, we -- there was some turbulence this week, but it seems to have settled itself. And -- and we'll see what the decisions they make next. And I -- I hear about them about the same time you do.

Yeah.

Okay.

Hopefully, mid- -- by midweek.

Thank you. Thanks, guys.
