What's up

I heard a lot of things with the work that we are doing together with our state and local partners and  that we've  in particular  extraordinary work. We've been on the ground before this  and continually through today. And we're in this for the long haul. And I think that what we have seen on the ground here is the best of what we all can do to prioritize taking care of the  responsible  coordination between state, local, federal, and then the work that just private citizens are doing, people who are looking out for each other.

And it's about communities bonding and taking care of one another, even though they may be perfect strangers to each other. I have always found in my life and career that some of the people who are most generous have the least to give and give everything they can to take care of each other. And so, we are seeing the heroes among us, and I'm very grateful for all the folks who are doing this work on the ground. Thank you.
