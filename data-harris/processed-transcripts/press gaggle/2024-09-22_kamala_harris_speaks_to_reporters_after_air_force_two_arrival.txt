Well, it's showing that there's a lot of support for our message and -- and what we need to do in terms of, you know, moving forward and charting a new way forward and dispensing with all of the attempts to divide our country and -- and to just, you know, really -- the problem I think on the other side is that there is a devaluation of who the American people are -- just don't really understand that we've got a lot of good people in our country who want to work hard and do well and we want a leader who believes that we're, you know, in this together.

And -- and we should have another one before Election Day. So, thank you, all.
