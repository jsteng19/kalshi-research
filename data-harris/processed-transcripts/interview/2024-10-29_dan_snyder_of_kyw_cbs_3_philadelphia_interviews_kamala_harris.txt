Donald Trump has spent a decade trying to keep the American people divided and afraid of each other. That is who he is. But America, I am here tonight to say that is not who we are.

Work we need to do going forward includes my perspective and new ideas about housing. You know, we've had a housing crisis in America, affordable housing crisis for a long time under Republican and Democratic administrations. I have a new approach, which is let's take it on and work in particular with builders and the private sector and developers tax credits so that they will actually build new housing to bring down the cost of housing because we're going to increase supply.

My plan, it's a new approach, it's about a $25,000 downpayment assistance for first-time homebuyers so they can just get their foot literally in the door to be able to have home ownership, which we know is -- is a key way that we can build intergenerational wealth among American families. So, I bring a new perspective.
