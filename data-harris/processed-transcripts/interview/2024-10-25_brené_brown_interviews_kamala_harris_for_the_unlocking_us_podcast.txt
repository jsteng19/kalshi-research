It is so good to be with you --

Dr. Brown. It is so good to be with you. Thank you.

Me, too.

OK.

Oh, Lord. How much time do you have?

OK.

OK. OK. So, I am one of two daughters who -- we were raised primarily by my mother. My parents divorced when I was five, and I'm the eldest. And my mother had two goals in her life: to raise her two daughters and to end breast cancer. She was a breast cancer researcher and one of the very few women and certainly one of the very few women of color.

And a lot of my work on women's health was formed, you know, when -- as I was growing up, listening to her and watching her passion about the need for women to have dignity in the health care system. We grew up in an incredible neighborhood where the kids, we would ride our bikes, just all of us together, you know, because the -- the way we were all raised was just go out and play.

Right. Get out of the house. Right? And we did have the bike gang.

Yes, I had my banana seat. Seriously, right?

And then -- and then the tassels and -- right?

Oh, we were very serious about this.

But that's exactly -- and wherever you ended up around dinnertime is where you ate.

Right?

Right? And so, I had the blessing of a really great childhood because it was -- like, it was a working-class neighborhood of -- you know, I try to explain to people, have you ever known a neighborhood where people are -- they're proud of their lawn?

You know what I mean?

Out there trimming their roses, out there mowing their lawn, and just pride in neighborhood, pride in community. It was the kids of the community. We were raised where -- I -- I talk about this, which is that I had and have an incredible family, and it is the family that I have that is by blood and it is the family that I have by love.

And that's how I was raised, that you create your family as much as you are born into your family, right?

And so, I grew up with, you know, this expectation also -- I joke about it. We were raised in a community of people that told all of us as kids that we were special. We weren't particularly special, but they told us we were, and we believed them, right?

And I think that, in parenting, there are certain things that we do for the children in our lives, that teachers do so beautifully, that we can all do that is just about inspiring a kid to believe that they are loved and they are special and then you create a high standard for them and they know they're supposed to rise to it, you know.

Right?

Right?

Yeah.

And that's it.

And that's it.

And then when you do that -- you know how kids are, especially, you know, like 12 and under, and you tell them that and they just start walking around with their chest out --

And their chin up. And that's one of the best things you can give a child. And then you let them explore, and you -- and you tell them they are special, which also means that we expect a lot of them.

OK.

No.

And therefore --

Yeah.

I mean, I was part of -- and I am like this with our kids and with -- you know I have baby nieces who I just love to pieces. They're my niece's children. And when you turn into, like, your 20s and then you look at your parents and you're like these are all the things you did wrong.

Right? And I remember saying to my mother, "You never took my side," because if I came home with any problem and talked to my mother about it, the first thing she would do was not "Oh, honey, come here. Let me hug you. Oh, honey, let me take care of it." The first thing she would do is look at you and say, "Well, what did you do?"

And what stuff --

But that's right because what I realized later is that she was teaching me and us that -- reflect on what your agency was at that moment and what was your responsibility; and to the extent that you can control it, don't let things happen to you.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

I see -- as you say that, I see that.

Yeah.

Right.

Right.

Right. Right.

Right. But the hope is the driver.

Exactly.

Yeah.

In a way that also requires you to -- I think it's very important to also -- in any situation; and certainly, it's a rule for today among those who call themselves leaders -- to then think about it in the context of reflection because it also requires reflection.

What happened? What could have happened? What role did I play in what happened?

And what role did I play? It could be something where you should critically analyze it or to know that that is -- that there is a lesson learned, right? And I think that's important.

Right? But that's exactly right. And that's right because, you know, as a -- as a leader, I'm very hard on myself, and one of the things that I feel and take very seriously is my responsibility to be prepared. Also, I've got this little thing about it's really important to me to be on time. In fact, someone teased me recently who's worked with a lot of elected leaders, and, like, I've never seen an elected leader who's always on time.

But I feel that I owe other people the respect of knowing their time is important.

Right? And the very least I can do is respect that in terms of what they've had to do in their day to meet with me, what they've had to put aside to do that. But there are these things that are about just what is your role in a moment of responsibility and -- and also duty. You know, I gave a speech years ago about the distinction that I see between duty and charity, right?

Right?

And there's a big difference.

Right? Charity kind of is -- I mean, I'm oversimplifying it obviously, but charity is, well, I have a little extra to give and I will be benevolent and I will give you some of what I have. Duty is the responsibility that you have. It's not an option.

It is a responsibility. You should not expect to be applauded for it because it is actually what you are supposed to do. And I -- I connect that to something I've seen my whole life and then most recently when I visited the aftermath of Hurricane Helene and I went to a lot of the relief centers. And you've probably seen this.

Right. And what you've probably seen there and I've seen throughout my life, it is often the case that the people who have the least to give --

Give the most.

Right?

Right? It's incredible. It's incredible. And that's what I mean about duty. It's not if you have. It's I have -- I have two pennies, I give you one, right?

Yeah.

Wow. Wow.

Right?

Right.

Yeah, of course.

Right.

Yeah.

Sure. Anything.

No, anything.

Oh, for sure.

You know, I was just talking with my team about this today. I -- I try not to harp on it, but there is certainly something to birth order.

Yeah.

Right?

Well, like I grew up, from the age of two, being told look after your sister.

Right.

It has --

Absolutely right.

Uh-huh.

So, C-Cubed was my -- C-Cubed was the name that I was given by my sorority when I joined the sorority.

We all had our nicknames.

And that was mine, and it stands for cool, calm, and collected. So, yes, that was a very long time ago and that was the name I was given. Yes.

Yeah. Oh, you did?

So, let me just tell you, my husband loves Depeche Mode, and I am not -- it's not my thing. It's just -- so that's funny you say that, but I did have that short cut, but that was like those days. It was those days.

But you know what, you're right, it was -- well, so the -- the person who kind of managed our sorority when I joined was a Houstonian. So, yes.

Yes, yes.

Oh, goodness. In high school.

Yeah.

I don't -- I didn't get my heart broken. I kind of just -- I went to college. You know, but there's also -- I mean, like my best friend from kindergarten is still one of my best friends.

No. In fact, she's been out campaigning for me in North Carolina, knocking on doors.

Right? I love my girlfriends. Like, I -- we have a sisterhood, like I have my sister and, in addition, my chosen sisters who we have traveled life together, right? I am godmother to their children. Our husbands are like brothers, right? And it's a big part of my life. It's a big part of my life. And it's a big part of probably my sanity.

Right?

You know.

And in fact, I tell women -- I mentor a lot of women and men, and I say this to -- to the youngest, though, including our kids, including younger, you know, adults. Know that -- again, this gets back to agency. Know you have a choice to decide who will be in your friend circle and choose those people who are going to root for you, those people who are not going to judge you but, at the same time, are going to say, "Girl, you need a mint."

Those who will laugh with you when you trip and fall and then they'll pull you back up and push you out. And -- and sometimes, I just simplify it this way because I did that a long time ago in my life. I'm not going to have mean friends.

But you have to be -- you have to be intentional about these things, right?

Oh, that's beautiful. I like that.

Yeah.

Right.

Right. And that's right. And -- and we have to teach -- and including other adults.

You -- actually, you have the right to not have mean people in your life and to sit back and actually be intentional about how do people make you feel. And it doesn't mean that people are just blowing smoke.

Right. And it does. And it --

And it absolutely does.

And it will not take you to a good place.

Right?

No, but there's not. And there's no safety in that either, right?

That's great.

Right. But you have to be intentional about it.

This is not like a television program where it's just going to happen because you just end up being someone's roommate.

Right?

Yeah.

It is -- and it is work. And friendships are work. And it's work that's good work. It's work that can be joyful work.

Yeah, it can be hard, but --

But it is.

Of course.

You have two sisters.

Oh, wow.

How old were you when they were born?

Oh, wow.

OK. OK.

And so, you're close to your brother.

Oh, my God.

That's great.

All three of them call you Sister Superior?

Yeah. And usually, around like a Thanksgiving dinner.

Yeah.

Well, you and I have had that experience of our mother's passing.

And what that -- and during an illness, what that does, right? Because it's interesting, the relationship between adult siblings in the context of your parents can have the effect of having you revert to your 12-year-old self.

Right?

Right. Like you could --

You could lead the world --

But you are just back to being 12.

Yup. Yeah, it's not pretty.

Exactly. That's good.

Oh, you've got -- I just feel like I should be writing notes right now.

OK.

Sure.

Yeah, yeah.

Yeah, they're probably directly connected, fairness and justice.

That's really, really important to me. I --

Yeah. I mean, I have -- I mean, I -- it is -- it prompts me to act if I -- if I see something that is unjust or unfair, and at the same time, fighting for that -- for others is something that is a real motivator of mine and actually will, you know, cause me to have a very almost emotional feeling --

About the importance of it.

Yikes. OK.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Right.

Absolutely. Yeah.

Yeah.

Very much. Very much.

I -- my lived experience is to know that the vast majority of us have more in common than what separates us. And -- OK. So -- so, you know, Gen Z and others will kind of -- they've got this whole meme about me and my, dare I say, obsession with Venn diagrams. I love Venn diagrams.

Right.

I love --

I love Venn diagram.

Like, are you -- if you're faced with conflict, pull out a Venn diagram.

Right?

I'm telling you. In fact, you know, when my goddaughter went to college, she's now a sophomore, and she comes and stays with me from time to time because we're both on the East Coast right now, and it was -- her -- one of her first weekends in her freshman year. And she's like," Auntie I've got --" And it's all these different groups and she's trying.

And I was like, "Honey, we're going to pull out the Venn diagram." That Venn diagram had about 11 circles on it.

And I was like, "OK, we're going to figure out where is the intersection, and then let's figure out where you're going to fit into it." I literally still have this Venn diagram. But I -- I just think that if we work toward coalition-building, we are stronger as a society. I just know it. And I know that when you bring together seemingly different people and you bring people around a table, you can watch -- and it's so exciting. You watch how the silos break down.

And everyone leaves a bit taller, you know.

Yeah. And -- and, you know, part of the struggle that I think we have increasingly in the society as it is evolving and, in some ways, devolving, people are feeling alone. And when you feel alone, it's very disempowering. And when we can bring people together and they see the commonality, it is then empowering of the individual, as well as what it does for the collective.

Right?

Yeah.

Yeah.

Right.

Right.

Go for it.

Just go for it.

Yeah.

The enemy within. He talks about the enemy within. American citizens.

Yeah.

Right, right, right.

It is a very real fear. And we have heard, look, the people who know Donald Trump best, who worked with him, members of his political party who worked with him inside the Oval Office, inside the Situation Room, who were his chief of staff. Most recently, the one who spoke out --

A four-star Marine general, his national security adviser, two secretaries of defense, and his former vice president have all said he is unfit to serve as president and he is dangerous. Donald Trump is someone who has said he would terminate the Constitution of the United States. I have taken the oath to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States six times: twice as DA, twice as attorney general, as a United States senator, and now as vice president.

There are very few oaths. You know, one that you -- that you make to your spouse, to God, but -- but to the Constitution of the United States is the highest duty, the most sacred duty that any office holder, especially president of the United States. And this man says he would terminate the Constitution of the United States.

And talking about enemies within, I mean, that harkens back to like McCarthyism.

Yeah.

Yeah. And -- and so, the fear is real and legitimate and very well founded. But what I urge everyone to do is do something with that fear, which is understand that we, as long as we hold on to it, have a democracy. And in a democracy in our country, the people have the power through their vote to determine who will be their leaders and who will be president of the United States.

And the direction of our country right now, we are truly at an inflection point. We are truly at an inflection point.

And --

Yeah.

She's so wonderful.

Historian, yeah.

Yeah.

Yup.

Anything.

Yeah.

Which is the key to the survival of the species.

Yeah. Yeah.

Right.

Yeah.

Yeah, that's my intention.

That's my intention.

And I'm going to tell you something. We are going to win. It is not going to be easy. We are going to win. I believe that the majority of Americans not only love our country deeply --

Right. But understand that at the end of the day, the true measure of the strength of a leader is not based on who you beat down, it's based on who you lift up. It's what we teach our kids. It's what we want in leaders in terms of how they look at us and think about us. And, you know, I talk about it on the campaign trail because I truly believe people are exhausted with the Trump era.

They're done. That no matter what the differences between us, we know that it is not healthy and it does not strengthen us as a nation to have Americans pointing their fingers at each other.

Right?

It's debilitating.

Right.

I think about that in freedom, freedom from, freedom to.

Yeah.

Right.

But the cruelty --

Is a key part of what you were talking about.

Yes, it is. And it is -- it is demeaning, but it is also -- it's traumatizing. And what we know --

And you know, you're the expert at this table, trauma, it numbs the individual.

It numbs the people. And when we are numb, we will not achieve our capacity, not to mention, we will not achieve not only our capacity in terms of productivity but in terms of a quality of life. I mean, I -- I think about it, and I think it is an important thing to think about, you know, what -- what brings you joy. I think that's important.

Right? And think of it this way. If you've ever tried to talk with someone who's depressed and you try to literally and figuratively open the curtains and say, "Look, it's -- the sun's out. It's a beautiful day," and they can't see it. And there is something about trauma that is very similar in terms of it blunts our senses and ability to see the good, the things that will bring joy.

It's not healthy. And so, we have to, to your point, diagnose it, and we have to treat it. And one of the ways to treat it ultimately is not only to deal with the symptoms but deal with the cause.

And that's what I'm trying to do.

Yes.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Right.

Right. Right.

That's interesting.

Yeah.

Of course. Of course. Of course.

Yup. Oh, yeah.

Nope.

Absolutely. And here's how I think about that. If you know what you stand for, then you know what to fight for. It's not fighting for the sake of fighting.

If you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for. I stand for the freedom of women to make decisions about their own body. I stand for the fact that we should treat each other with dignity and respect. I stand for the proposition that we need to lift up working people and give them access to opportunity.

These are the kinds of things I stand for, so I fight for them.

Of course.

Right.

You know what to fight for.

I know. Yeah.

Yeah.

No.

You're absolutely right, and you hit it on the head because it is not only if you know what to stand for, you know what to fight for. If you love, you know what to fight for.

And I know this is going to sound corny, but I love our country.

I do.

I do. And I -- I believe in the promise of America. I am empirical evidence of the promise of America. I know what we can do. I know what we -- I believe in the foundational principles, and maybe that's being trained as a lawyer and one of the reasons I wanted to become a lawyer. I believe that we can make true all of those words we spoke about our commitment to equality, to liberty, to justice.

I believe in all that. But none of it will come without us being vigilant. No, it won't. You know, on democracy, look, I think there's a duality to its nature.

Right? On the one hand, strength. When a democracy is intact, what it does to protect the rights and the freedoms and the liberties of its people. Incredible strength.

On the other hand, incredibly fragile.

It will only be as strong as our willingness to fight for it. I guess that's your point also about the duality in terms of the paradox.

Yeah, that's -- yeah, that's right. Yeah.

Yeah.

I'm with you so -- I'm with -- I'm so with you.

By deed. And deed.

Faith in your works.

Right?

No.

I'm -- I'm so with you. And I have never -- I have, as an elected person, purposely not talked a lot because I just find that the people who do tend to be hypocrites.

And, you know, I was raised -- I was raised in a Black church. I was raised to believe in a loving God. And the God that I believe in and pray to is a God that says do justice, have mercy.

It is about do good. It is about feed the hungry. It is about care for the poor and the elderly. It is about love thy neighbor. It is about the Good Samaritan who, in the face -- I mean, that's one of my favorites, the parable of the Good Samaritan, which is -- you know, my way of talking about it is that we should in the face of a stranger see a neighbor, right?

Right? And that -- getting back to what I saw in terms of the relief centers after Hurricane Helene.

That is doing the work of --

Of living your faith.

I like to say faith is a verb.

Right?

Because it is about -- it is about knowing something even when you can't see it, but it is also about then manifesting it, right, and -- and then making it real. And so then, that's when you see faith and you have faith, right, when you see it in the works and the deeds as an expression of your deeply held beliefs.

No, no, no. Of course not.

Yeah, I agree.

And it is the highest form of patriotism, I believe, to fight for the ideals of our country.

Right?

That's exactly right. And so, in this election, fighting for free and fair elections, fighting for the fact that we will have a president who does not aspire to be a dictator, admiring people like the president of Russia. We will have in our leaders those who vow to uphold and protect the Constitution of the United States, not terminate it.

Isn't that -- aren't those -- those examples of what we believe patriotism to be, which is the love of our country, understanding the oath and the responsibility, in particular, that elected leaders --

Have --

To foundational principles.

Yeah.

And they're not political people.

I agree with you.

So, I -- as vice president of the United States, I have now met over 150 world leaders: presidents, prime ministers, chancellors, and kings. Many of them multiple times. We're on a first-name basis. When we walk in those rooms around the world representing the United States of America, we have traditionally been able to walk in those rooms chin up, shoulders back, with the earned and self-appointed authority to talk about things like democracy and rule of law.

But being a role model means people watch what you do to see if it matches up to what you say.

What otherwise, imperfect though we may be, is a gold standard --

If not the gold standard. And I will tell you that part of my hope and prayer for us as a country is that among the stakes that we understand are at play in this election, that -- that we all understand how important America is to the rest of the world. I really -- I -- I hope and I pray we fully understand what we mean to the rest of the world --

Where people in various parts of the world are fighting for democracy, where women are fighting for their ability to be educated, to have rights. And so, you know, these national security leaders, having their support and endorsement, I'm deeply honored, but it also is testament to the fact that -- just like John Kelly recently speaking out publicly about -- his concerns about Trump and fascism and all of that.

Think of their letter as a 911 call to the American people.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

And this is not 2016 or 2020.

He is also increasingly unstable.

And unhinged. And the significance of even the words that you read about -- you know, I -- I asked people to imagine -- we can all picture the Oval Office. You've seen it on TV. Imagine the Oval Office in your head, just imagine it, on January 20th of 2025. If Donald Trump is sitting there, he will be stewing over his enemies list.

Right? Versus what I intend to do, which is sitting there, thinking of the American people, working on my to-do list. There's a big difference.

That's right.

We've come full circle.

That's right.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

I know. I assume that's where you're going because I've heard --

There's -- there are a lot of --

There are a lot of pregnant women who do not want to travel to states with Trump abortion bans for exactly that reason that God forbid something happens, God forbid they are experiencing difficulty with their pregnancy or miscarriage --

Absolutely.

Yeah.

It's -- again, this gets back to the fact that we must be vigilant and we have to remember that we can never take our rights for granted. Back to your point about talking with folks about whether they should get very activated around this election --

And knock on doors and tell people why they care --

And why it matters and why they should vote.

This is the day. This is the time.

Because this is -- this is. And I mean, the fundamental -- the notion that in the United States of America in this year of our Lord 2024, that women don't have the right to make decisions about their own body, I mean, what could be more fundamental? We're not talking about property rights. We're literally talking about the right to make decisions about your own body.

And in Texas, the law provides up to prison for life for a physician, a health care provider for performing the care that they deem in the best interest of their patient. And can you imagine, what's happening now is that I've talked to a lot of physicians and medical school professors --

And they're seeing a decline in their post-docs --

Who want to go into family -- or go into family medicine, in particular, reproductive health care because these students are -- they're -- they don't want to go to states. And that we now have 20 states with Trump abortion bans. And you already look at the fact that we still have the -- the sad reality of America is we still have the highest rate of maternal mortality of any so-called wealthy nation.

If you look at the reasons behind that, it includes the lack of appropriate and adequate care for women in the context of their reproductive systems --

Whether it be pre-pregnancy, during pregnancy, postpartum. We have so many deserts -- we call them deserts for maternal care.

And you have then the effect that includes that people don't want to go into reproductive health care. I'm the first vice president and never has there been a president who has gone to a reproductive health clinic. I wanted to go because I wanted to highlight the fact that in these clinics, also, it's not only abortion care.

That's where they do Paps. They do breast cancer screenings.

They do HIV screenings.

Right.

But exactly right, and because you knew and so many people know, you walk into that clinic and that's where you're going to be treated with dignity. You're not going to be judged. It's a safe place. That's what these clinics offer. Usually, they are run by women. And they're closing in many places because of the laws that are present in those states.

So, you're talking about so many ramifications, whether it be students going into to -- to medical practice for reproductive care, whether it be clinics closing, whether it be pregnant women not wanting to travel, whether it be kids like some of my godchildren who in high school are -- are making college application decisions based on which state --

Right? The ramifications of this highlight a fact, which is that Donald Trump, through his decision to put those three members on the Supreme Court to undo Roe, has created a health care crisis in America. This is a health care crisis.

Darn.

I know. Like, I could sit here and talk to you all afternoon.

OK.

Sunday family dinner, hands down. In -- in my normal life, I love to cook, and Sunday family dinner is non-negotiable. Everyone comes, whoever's in town. They can bring their friends. And I cook. We have our routines. Sunday family dinner, hands down.

Really?

Really?

Thank you for your voice. I said it to you before we started the program, but you give voice to so many people who rightly must be seen and heard. And you talk about leadership. What you do with your voice and your platform is really build community in a very important way, and I thank you for that because that's in the best interest of all of us.

So, thank you, and it's great to be with you. I look forward to talking with you again.

Yes, we will.
