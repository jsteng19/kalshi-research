You know I watch Shark Tank all the time.

And then I often -- depending on -- because, you know, there are a lot of reruns. I'll look it up to see how the company is doing.

Hi.

How are you, Mark?

Thank you for everything, Mark.

Thank you. Thank you.

I am excited to talk with you.

You know, long days.

I start -- every day, I work out every morning. No matter --

I -- elliptical. And then I go, and I go all day long.

You know, I -- your body doesn't lie to you when you first wake up in the morning --

And then your brain kicks in and says, oh, everything will be fine, right?

And it gets me going every morning.

OK.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

All the time.

So, my mother was a scientist, right?

So, I grew up as a kid going to the lab. I grew up seeing her have a passion about she wanted to end breast cancer, she wanted to find a cure, and she did make breakthroughs in breast cancer research.

And I -- probably, that's where I just -- the source of my geeking out.

Right.

Yes.

Yes.

The red tape.

It slows things down.

So, part of it is we cannot be rote in terms of how we think about deficits to say the government spends too much because I think that is overly simplistic.

We have to ask, are we spending it in a smart way such that we are yielding a return on that investment that is --

But this is exactly right.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

I don't think he pays attention to the details, and you can't be president of the United States --

Yeah. That's fine if he wants to, you know, just give speeches in random places for random reasons, but to talk about such significant policy like tariffs --

Much less foreign policy, he is applying a machete when a scalpel is what's necessary.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Right.

Goldman Sachs, Moody's, Wall Street Journal, most recently, 16 Nobel laureates have all examined our policies. Mine, as has been reviewed, will strengthen the economy. His will weaken it. It will incite inflation --

And invite a recession by the middle of next year, Mark.

You know, let's not forget, he was handed so much of what he's had and has lost it, and he doesn't understand how people like you and so many others -- and this is what I love about the American people -- who are hardworking, who have grit, who are innovative, and who start with --

Nothing and make something.

And that's something he doesn't get.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

I know. I know.

Yeah.

And you need to buy a crib and a car seat.

How are they going to actually afford it, especially during that first year of the child's life? Right now, for so many of Gen Z, Gen X, the -- the idea of the American dream is really elusive.

It was an older concept.

And a big part of it being housing supply. We don't have enough, and so the prices go up.

That's why I want to build more housing supply but also work with developers and homebuilders to cut the red tape and then get them tax credits.

Right.

Yeah. Yeah.

Right.

No, of course, not.

Yeah. It's that energy and that grit, to your point, that is going to spur us into the future, right? Because here's the other thing about entrepreneurs. You can't be a successful entrepreneur without actually thinking about where things are going.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Right.

The idea of knowing that it is possible for us if we work and study something, that we can create something that improves and uplifts the human condition --

That excites me to no end. Like that -- that's where I see where we could actually combine a lot of our -- our areas of focus.

Yeah.
