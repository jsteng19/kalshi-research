Thank you.

Thank you.

Hi. Thank you. Oh my God. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Hi, guys. Thank you. Thank you, all.

They know how to pronounce my name. Thank you, all. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.

I noticed that a whole lot of people know how to pronounce my name. Thank you, all, very much. Thank you.

It's so good to be with you, Stephen. Thank you.

Thank you.

Yes.

It is.

It is.

Yes.

Yeah.

Category 5. Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Well, first of all, to all of those folks in North Carolina and Georgia, please know that FEMA and the people on the ground are there to help you. You are entitled to help. There's a lot of misinformation. And I -- I beseech you, I beg you to please not pay attention to it because there are a whole lot of folks who are there to give you help and aid in terms of the immediate aftermath and what people need to do in terms of getting through the -- the height of this emergency and this crisis, but also in terms of long-term help.

And that means applying for it, knowing that the services are there. But I'll tell you, Stephen, I mean, there's so much devastation already from Hurricane Helene. I -- I met a woman in Georgia who just days before lost her husband because a tree fell on their house and killed him. And I met she and her daughter days after he -- he died.

And I -- what just upsets me so is the idea that any politician would play political games with these folks, with people who are in the midst of such suffering, loss of life, loss of their homes, loss of normalcy, and then for the sake of political gain, tell these lies in a way that is meant to make people distrust the help that is there for them to receive.

It just is something we have to say, "Look, at some point, we have to work together." And I'll tell you, there are plenty of leaders who are working in a bipartisan way. I've talked to governors of both parties who are working in a bipartisan way to get the aid to people on the ground, and -- and I'm going to continue to do that work.

Correct.

They are. They are. They are. And they should be commended. They should be commended.

And it's crude.

And it's crude. Have you no empathy, man?

You know, I -- for the -- the suffering of other people. Have you no sense of purpose if you purport to be a leader to understand that being a leader means lifting people up in a time of need and not manipulating them?  You know?

And --

But --

But before we go on, if -- if I may --

Just tonight, the hurricane that is about to hit Florida is extremely serious and is predicted to be historic in proportion in terms of the damage it will cause. And I know there are a lot of tough Floridians who have waded out many hurricanes and may think that they can do the same with this one. This one's going to be different.

And so, I -- I ask anybody who is watching, if you are in Florida, in the predicted path of this hurricane, if you've got a family member who might be, you know, thinking they can wait it out, please get in touch with them. Tell them it's not going to be like the ones we've seen before. Please follow your local leaders' instructions.

And if they're telling you to evacuate, grab your stuff and get out.

Yes.

It's definitely been a whirlwind. I mean, it's, I think, somewhere around 70 days that we've been in it, and -- and so there's a lot of catching up to do. You know, my opponent, the former president, has been running since 2020 and --

Yeah. Right. So, we like have a lot of time to -- to make up for. But I'm -- you know, I'm -- I'm traveling around the country. I'm spending a lot of time talking with folks, listening to folks. And the one thing I can report back from the field, if you will, is that people are exhausted by that old tired playbook of Donald Trump's.

They really are. And -- and even if they voted for him -- even if they voted for him in the past, there are a lot of folks who are just saying, you know, enough of the rhetoric that's about trying to divide the country and have Americans point their fingers at each other. You know, folks are ready to turn the page.

It's like let's chart a new way forward. And -- and what I'm seeing is that a lot of Americans, regardless of their party, Republicans, Democrats, independents, they're ready for a new generation of leadership that is about solutions and common sense and finding common ground. And -- and that is what I -- I am offering.

Yeah.

Yeah.

No. My phone has so many protections around it.

No.

It's called outreach, Stephen.

It's in the campaign.

OK.

It's -- it's family TV, right? It starts with a W. There's a letter in between, and then the end -- the last letter is F.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

And big corporations.

Yeah.

Yes.

Right.

But in all seriousness --

No, but in all -- in all --

But in all seriousness --

The -- we have to agree that teachers and firefighters and nurses should not be paying a higher tax rate than billionaires and the biggest corporations.

Right?

And -- and so, look, I'm not mad at anybody for creating wealth. Good for you. You work hard. You create wealth for you and your family. Good for you. I am a capitalist. But look, I'm also a devout public servant. I know the limitations of government, but I also know that we need to make sure that we -- that everyone is paying their fair share so that we can do the work of extending, as I intend to do, the child tax credit to $6,000 for the first year of a child's life because that young family could use that money to buy a car seat, to buy a crib; what we need to do to bring down the cost of health care in America.

We've capped the cost of insulin for our seniors at $35 a month. It's my intention to cap the cost of prescription medication for all Americans. They're paying too much, right?

OK.

Of course. Of course.

Sure. Well, I mean, I'm obviously not Joe Biden.

And so, that would be one change in terms of --

But also, I think it's important to say with, you know, 28 days to go, I'm not Donald Trump. And -- and so, when we think about the significance of what this next generation of leadership looks like were I to be elected president, it is about -- frankly, I -- I -- I love the American people, and I -- I believe in our country.

I -- I -- I love that it is our character and nature to be an ambitious people. You know, we -- we have aspirations. We have dreams. We are -- we -- we have incredible work ethic. And -- and -- and I just believe that we can create and -- and build upon the success we've achieved in a way that we continue to grow opportunity and, in that way, grow the strength of our nation.

I -- so, for example, my economic policies, I -- I think of it and I have named it as -- as creating an opportunity economy. So, it's about things like investing in small businesses. I love our small businesses. The woman who helped raise us, we call her our second mother because my mother worked long days and hours, she was a small business owner.

So, as a child, I grew up knowing that a small business owner is someone who is a leader in the community, hires locally, trains locally, builds, contributes to the civic and the cultural fabric, right? So, my plan includes extending a tax deduction for startup small businesses to $50,000 instead of what currently it is at $5,000 because nobody in 2024 can start up a small business with $5,000.

My -- my -- I believe and -- you know, I spend a lot of time talking, in particular, with -- with young families, young people across our country. And -- and frankly, Stephen, the American dream right now is really elusive for far too many people in terms of even aspiring to own a home. It's -- it's too expensive.

We don't have enough housing. We have a housing shortage. So, part of my plan is to work with the private sector, with builders and developers to build 3 million more homes by the end of my first term and to give first-time homebuyers a $25,000 down payment assistance so they can just get their foot in the door to homeownership, which is the fastest and the most efficient way for people to build intergenerational wealth.

These are the ways that I think about how we build up our country in a way that is about supporting the middle class. I come from the middle class. I'm never going to forget where I come from. And I know that the middle class and strengthening the middle class is how you strengthen America and our economy.

So --

I -- I did. I have pointed out through my three and a half years of being vice president that it's vice president and -- and there are a lot of responsibilities that you take on. But, you know, it's interesting. Did you see that kid who was interviewed after their debate? And -- oh, you have to see it, Stephen.

And he gave a -- just a total civics lesson about the role of vice president.

Oh, yeah.

Yeah, he was in the audience.

I -- I encourage anybody to look at it on YouTube.

It was so good.

But, you know, Tim Walz, I have to tell you, someone asked me recently what's the last big decision I made that was a gut decision. And when I was looking at potential running mates, there are incredibly talented, experienced, wonderful people. And ultimately, I chose and asked Tim Walz because just my gut told me that he will be what I think we want in our country.

You know, he reminds me of people I grew up with. We grew up in two different parts of the country. You know, he grew up in a rural area in the Midwest. I grew up in -- in California. Seemingly, if you look at the two of us together, we have nothing in common, but he's the kind of people I grew up with.

They may have been a different race and a different part of the country, hardworking folks, folks who are plain talking, who care about family, care about community, care about hard work. That's who Tim Walz is. He's going to be a great vice president.

Yeah.

So -- so, yesterday, we commemorated that massacre that took place on October 7th last year, and Doug and I actually decided to have a very simple brief ceremony. We planted a pomegranate tree at the vice president's residence in honor of those who were lost, in honor of also what -- frankly, and I spoke about this, what we must always retain, which is some level of faith in what is possible in terms of shining light on a moment of darkness.

I truly do believe that's important, and it is something we learn regardless of your religion or just I think what we should all retain as some level of optimism. And in this -- in this matter, we -- we must have a cease-fire and hostage deal as -- as immediately as possible. This war has got to end.

It has to end. And -- and we cannot lose some belief in the possibility of it because then, to your point, we throw up our hands instead of rolling up our sleeves. But it is complex, and we could -- it -- it is a conversation that requires probably more time than you and I have right now, but --

Yeah.

Yeah.

Close means that a lot of the details had been worked out, but details remained. And so, there has been some progress, but it -- it is meaningless unless a deal is -- is actually reached. So, I -- I don't want to suggest to you that -- that we should be applauded for getting close at times to a deal.

The reality of it is 1,200 people were massacred. There are still hostages being held in Gaza. I've met with the families of hostages, both who are alive and who have -- as we learned recently, who have died. I have met with families of Palestinians who have been killed, innocent people who have been killed in Gaza.

And there is pain -- pain that -- and -- and suffering that is happening in that region of the world, and we must work and the United States must work and not lose hope and not throw up our hands around the role we must play in -- in -- in urging and seeking and building toward a resolution. And the first thing that's going to unlock that is we've got to get a deal done. And we're not going to give up.

Yeah.

Dictators and authoritarians --

And people who have been well-described as murderers.

So, I --

Yeah. So, I heard about it today. I haven't read it. But look, I said it even in the debate, Donald Trump, he -- he openly admires dictators and authoritarians. He has said he -- he wants to be a dictator on day one if he were elected again as president. He -- he gets played by these guys. He admires so-called strongmen, and he gets played because they'd flatter him or offer him favor.

The commander in chief of the United States of America must stand strong on -- and --- and defend the principles that we hold dear. We should stand with our allies. We should strengthen the alliances that we have such as NATO, which is the strongest military alliance the world has ever seen. We must stand with our friend Ukraine, where Russia is attempting to change borders by force.

And then you hear, if -- if this is -- if everything I've heard about Bob Woodward's book is -- is -- is right, Donald Trump secretly sent COVID test kits to Putin for his personal use. I ask everyone here and everyone who is watching, you remember what those days were like? You remember how many people did not have tests and were trying to scramble to get them? You remember how rare it was to have one? You remember people by the hundreds were dying every day? We would watch the number every day being reported of people who were dying, people who were in hospitals without their family, where the only touch that they had was of a nurse that they hadn't met because the family could not get there.

And this man is giving COVID test kits to Vladimir Putin. Think about what this means, on top of him sending love letters to Kim Jong Un. No, think about it. He thinks Vladimir Putin is his friend. What about the American people? They should be your first friend.

Uh-huh.

OK. The last time I had beer was at a baseball game with Doug. So --

Ok. Cheers.

Yeah.

The Champagne of Beers.

Yeah.

OK.

OK.

OK.

49ers.

No one will be mad at you for being loyal to your team.

You can't -- you just can't be, right?

OK.

It's just --

You know, I -- I -- I'm going to tell you what some of the people in -- in my rallies -- quite a few people are showing up, by the way.

You know, when you've lost -- you lost millions of jobs, you lost manufacturing, you lost automotive plants, you lost the election, what does that make you?  A loser. This is what one of -- somebody at my rally said. I thought it was funny.

This is what happens when I drink beer.

Yeah, that's right.

That's right.

Well --

Well, here's what I would like to raise about that piece. You know, when people are often applying for a job, they'll ask, well, why is the job open, OK? One must ask, why is the job of Donald Trump's running mate, why was it open? And it was open because his vice president, Mike Pence, stood for country above party, stood for Constitution above favor and pleasing someone who would and tried actively, including inciting a violent mob, to undo the will of the people, undo the outcome of a free and fair election.

And I do believe -- you know, in this race, I am proud to have the support of a lot of Republicans who worked for both Presidents Bush, for John McCain, for Mitt Romney, for Donald Trump who are -- who are saying, listen, we got to put country above party, we have to honor the Constitution of the United States, and we want a president who will actually uphold the rule of law and -- and -- and take seriously the oath to the Constitution of the United States.

And so, when I think about this whole issue about January 6th, for a lot of folks who are supporting me, and I think a lot of folks who voted for Donald Trump in the past, that was a bridge too far. That was a bridge too far. And that's what I think is going to motivate and has motivated a lot of people to say, look, it's time to turn the page.

We need a new way forward. Enough with the nonsense. We're exhausted. Let's just -- let's -- let's push toward the future of our country. Let's not go backwards. And I think that's what's motivating a lot of people to -- to -- to get involved.

Cheers.

Cheers.
