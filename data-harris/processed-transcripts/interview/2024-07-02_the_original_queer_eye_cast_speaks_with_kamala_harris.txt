Happy pride.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Jim Rivaldo.

I mean, yeah. He was a really special -- you know, they're so -- and, of course, they were -- you know, they were the -- they were the -- you know, they were really, I want to say, the fathers of, you know --

Of the movement.

They were the fathers of the movement, right?

And so -- and, Rivaldo, as we called him, he was like a family member to us by the end of it all. He was just family. In fact, my mother took care of him as he was sick and dying and he had AIDS.

And -- and Rivaldo felt so Strongly about the movement being a function of many things, including a collective fight for freedom and for justice and -- and the importance of community. But the importance of, in particular, coalition building. Right? So, Rivaldo was an Italian American, white gay man.

Who loved Black people. He believed in a Black woman being the first Black woman to be the DA of a major city. Right?

He would talk about how he and Harvey and the leaders of the movement always understood the interconnection.

Right.

And the interconnection of struggle.

Right? And so, yeah. And so, he was. And he was -- he was so special. He -- he actually -- he was a very special person. He -- and he was very talented. He was actually a part of Harvard Lampoon in the earliest days of it.

Which you guys would appreciate, right?

Yeah, he was a very, very special person. So, yeah.

That's right.

That's exactly right.

What you do -- you're so right. So, OK. As it turned out, I went to a Planned Parenthood clinic a few months ago now because I wanted to highlight this point which is that when all of these abortion bans happen in the states where it has happened, these clinics have had to shut down. And they provide so much care.

Including HIV testing.

They provide, I mean, screenings of every sort. And the thing about these clinics, which I'm sure you could talk about and we have all seen, they give people dignity.

They're trusted.

They're in touch with the community.

People know that that's a place you can go for health care where you will receive dignity, and you will not be judged.

And that's so important. We have to always appreciate that because it's not always the case.

Right?

That's exactly right.

That's exactly -- that's exactly right. And so, the -- I'm so glad you raised that because the intersection around all of these issues. It turned out I was the first vice president of the United States to ever go to a reproductive care clinic.

It's -- it --

Right?

But to highlight these exact points.

Thank you.

Right?

Yeah.

Right. Right.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Right.

That's exactly right. That's exactly right. And I mean, remember that -- remember during the height of -- of the AIDS epidemic how badly people were being treated. I mean, it was just -- it was awful. And again, the -- the stereotypes, the myths, compounded with the lack of services.

And --

It's so important.

Yeah.

Wow.

Yeah.

Thank you.

I'm very touched that you shared that with me.

I think it's -- you know, there's -- I've been talking a lot recently about what I think we've all sadly witnessed over the last several years, which is this suggestion that the measure of the strength of the leader is based on who you beat down instead of what we know. The true measure of the strength of a leader, elected, in whatever position they're in, the true measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up.

Right? Like that's -- you want to know your strength.

Right? And the idea that it's a sign of weakness to have empathy when, in fact, isn't that the sign of the strength of character --

Which is to have some level of concern and care about the suffering, the well-being of other people, and then take it upon yourself to do something about it? I think we all agree that that is actually a character strength.

Right?

Right.

Can you tell -- it was such an incredible groundbreaking thing that history now, 20 years later, I think everyone understands what you guys did to -- to really -- to just talk about giving fuel --

To people's sense of -- their consciousness about --

Who is what.

And how we should all think about ourselves in relation to each other. How did that come about? Like, what -- what happened?

No.

Because it was considered derogatory.

Right, right.

Yeah, yeah, yeah. I figured that like.

Really?

But you have not forgotten.

Right. Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah.

That's right.

Oh.

Oh.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Oh, yeah.

Right, right.

Yeah.

Right.

That's right.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Nice.

Right.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

That's exactly right.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Oh, you have an Ella.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

It's --

And -- but, you know, this is the thing about this moment, right? You know there's a phrase from Coretta Scott King that I paraphrase all the time, all the time. And she famously said the fight for civil rights, which is the fight for equality, it's the fight for justice must be fought and won with each generation.

And I think part of her point was that it's the nature of the progress and the gains that we make.

They will not be permanent unless we are vigilant. We have to be vigilant. And so, the second point of that admonition then is, OK, understanding that's the nature of it all, do not despair.

It's the nature of it.

Right? So just --

Right? Right. It's George Morgan.

So, we just know what we have to do. Got it. Like got it. I understand that.

Got it.

That's exactly right. We have -- we can't take any of these things for granted. And -- and let's also, you know, be fueled by the optimism to know that we can also get better than we are and that --

And that it's not only about maintaining the progress that we've achieved, but let's keep going.

Like the Equality Act, we still need to get the Equality Act.

Right?

Right?

Yes.

Well, that's exactly right.

There's an election --

And there will be a lot of issues that are decided based on that election. And here's the thing. This election in November is asking each of us a very fundamental question: What kind of country do we want to live in?

And we each have the power to answer that mhm right and I think that's part of what we have to remind every one of. There are forces that are trying to divide us.

There are forces that are trying to make people feel small and outside, and we have to remind each other that no don't ever let anyone take your power from you, including the power of your voice through your vote. Right? And to remember that we're all part of a community of people who are propelled by, you know, love of thy neighbor.

Right?

And I think that's -- that's the thing that gives me a sense of optimism is knowing that the majority of us, I think, do value certain things, including that we fight for each other's dignity.

That we agree to the foundational principles of our country. Right? All equal.

Entitled to certain freedoms and certain rights.

That should not be taken.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah.

That's right.

That's exactly right.

That's exactly right.

And your voice is welcome.

Right?

And it's -- it's legitimate, and it's important.

Right? And it matters.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

That's right.

Yeah.

That's right.

Amen.

Amen. Amen. You're right, it's -- it's -- it's really -- it is that fundamental.

And that, you know, it's that -- and that each person has a right to, you know, I talked about it last night, to be.

Right?

And just to be --

And to be safe in that --

And to not be judged in that --

And to receive the dignity to which all people are entitled. Right?

And deserve.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yes.

Yes, yes, yes.

Yes.

Yes.

Yes.

Yeah. That was -- that was what --

That's what Harvey -- that's -- that was one of Harvey Harvey's real --

Points. It's never -- it's not about quiet hope.

Because that's not true hope.

Right? If you think of hope as -- hope is a verb.

It's about --

Action.

Right? That's how we should think about it --

As a verb. Right?

I mean, I think the same way about faith.

It's a verb.

Right?

You act on it.

Right?

How do people -- so -- so I now live in Los Angeles --

But I am from -- I am -- I am from the Bay Area. And so I gave myself a -- I'm a Sangeleno.

You like it?

OK. Right?

Why not?

The first like 15 minutes of this, I got so overwhelmed by being in the presence of Madam Vice President that I completely forgot all of the beats that we were here to talk about. And then I started talking about my HIV status and Planned Parenthood. While that's really important, I just want to say sorry about that and what a great chat this has been.

I'm so sorry about that. Anyway, I just needed to express that. OK, great.

Oh, you have to --

Oh, my.

Oh.

Oh, thank you.

You know what? He's --

He's going to be so happy to hear this.

No, I can't tell you how happy he will be.

Yeah, that's -- my husband is pretty spectacular.

Talk about somebody who is just completely self-actualized.

Like, he just --

He really is. He's just. He's comfortable in his skin.

And in his life. He loves his family, he works hard, he's kind.

He has a wonderful sense of humor.

He loves my cooking.

And I love to cook.

It works out really well.
