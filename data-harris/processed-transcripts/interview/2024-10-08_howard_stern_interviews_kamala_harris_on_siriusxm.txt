Well, try not to fall asleep during this interview.

Not really, I wish I could.

I don't mind, you know, like, in a different life, you know, sometimes on a Sunday afternoon. Yeah.

Yes

Really?

No, not -- I mean, no. I mean, like, obviously, like 1999, I thought, was spectacular. You can go back to his early days.

But like him on the guitar, there was just nothing like it. And so many people have -- I mean, even you look at Bruno Mars today, right?

Who -- who've just been influenced by Prince. You know the night he passed, Doug and I were in LA and actually just -- like, he and I have very different musical tastes, my husband and I.

Depeche Mode

It's just -- yeah, that's him.

I grew up kind of hip-hop. And -- but Prince is the one intersection where we both love. And we just played Prince all night long. We danced, we sang his songs, it was -- that was our little tribute.

I never met him in real life.

Tell me, though, I want to hear it.

Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah.

Right.

And he wanted you to feel it with your ears and your spirit instead of your eyes, right?

What time of night was it? You know, he was famously a night owl.

It was?

Yeah.

I just have always -- and you're right, I was raised this way. It's not about you, it's about what you do. Right?

And -- and so, it is. It feels immodest to me to talk about myself, which apparently I'm doing right now.

Yeah. You do, you do.

And a friend of mine actually said, "Look, this is not a time to worry about modesty because this is, you know, obviously, you got to let people know who you are."

Yeah.

I agree with you.

Well, I just saw it actually, and it was funny. I am a huge fan of Maya Rudolph. I think she put a lot of time into to doing the -- the piece and -- and the character. But to your point, I literally lose sleep and have been over what is at stake in this election. I mean, honestly, I -- I end the day pretty much every day these days asking myself what can I do more?

The stakes are so high.

Yeah.

Yeah.

I think that -- you know, Howard, people ask me, like, "What do you think is going on, and what -- what is the tension here? What's at stake?" And there are many things and I can be much more articulate than what I'm going to say. But, ultimately, I do believe that this is an election that is about strength versus weakness.

And weakness as projected by someone who puts himself in front of the American people and does not have the strength to stand in defense of their needs, their dreams, their desires. The work that must happen to make sure that we are a secure nation, that we are nurturing and protecting our alliances around the world, that we are supporting America's military, that we are fighting to bring the cost of living down for working families, that we are building businesses, building growth --

And NATO -- NATO, which is the greatest military alliance the world has ever known.

You want to talk about strength?

That is strength to -- to -- to embrace that alliance as America -- as Americans. And he would walk away because he admires dictators --

More than he does our allies.

So, I actually said it even in the debate. I believe that Donald Trump has this desire to be a dictator. He admires strongmen, and he gets played by them because he thinks that they're his friends,

And they are manipulating him full time and manipulating him by flattery --

And with favor. And so in the midst -- to your point, as reported by Bob Woodward, in the height of the pandemic, and remember and your listeners will remember, people were dying by the hundreds.

We -- everybody was scrambling to get these kits, the tests, the COVID test kits.

Couldn't get them.

Couldn't get them anywhere.

And this guy, who was president of the United States, is sending them to Russia to a murderous dictator for his personal use?

Well, the point being that is just the most recent stark example of who Donald Trump is, that he secretly sent COVID test kits for the personal use of Putin of Russia, an adversary to the United States, when he was talking about Americans should be putting bleach in their blood. Think about what this is.

Think about this -- this person who wants to be president again, who secretly is helping out an adversary when the American people are dying by the hundreds every day and in need of relief. And instead, how did he handle it domestically from Americans, he mismanaged the whole thing.

To your point, doesn't support our friend, Ukraine; doesn't support, therefore, something America should always and has always, by the way, been a champion of, which is the importance of sovereignty and territorial integrity, which means the importance of standing against anyone who tries to take another nation by force.

That's what we stand for as Americans that you don't do that. And if you do that to our friends, we're going to stand with our friends. It's a -- you're getting played, and some would say -- look, I grew up in the neighborhood. Some would say you're getting punked.

If you stand in favor of somebody who's an adversary over your friends on principles that we all agree on. And you look at it -- it's -- it's -- not only that. He says he's going to be a dictator on day one. But understand what dictators do. They jail journalists. They -- they put people who are protesting in the street in jail.

Yeah.

But back to the point about what it actually is, and then let's talk about it and call it what it is, it's a sign of weakness in a leader.

To not stand in defense of your people, the American people. It's a sign of weakness in the commander-in-chief of the United States of America to not stand on the side of supporting your military. Don't forget Donald Trump calling members of our military prisoners of war, suckers and losers.

Absolutely.

Absolutely.

He says he doesn't like him because "I don't like people who got caught." A prisoner of war, an American hero.

Think about this guy who -- by the way, his former chief of staff, two secretaries of defense, his national security advisor, people who served with Donald Trump in the White House have said he is unfit to be commander-in-chief and is dangerous. So, the people who know him best have let us know they've seen them, they've worked with him in the Oval Office, and they know he is dangerous and unfit to be president of the United States.

That's exactly right.

You know, Howard --

The -- the -- the thing about the cats and dogs -- and again --

Yeah.

There were a couple of moments at least in the debate where it was surreal, honestly.

We're in a debate before it turned out, I think, 60 million Americans who are tuning in, meaning they're not dealing with all of their other priorities because they want to hear a debate about who will be the next president of the United States. And they want to know where do they stand on the issues and how will they lead and how will they make a difference in my life.

And one of those two people, Donald Trump, on that stage spent time talking about how people are eating pets. One of those people on stage spent full time talking about his personal grievances, about himself full time, instead of talking about the needs of the American people. And I actually there were moments when I was on that debate stage where I was -- you know, I knew what he -- he does at his rallies, but this was a very serious moment.

To earn the votes of the American people. And he was talking about things that were factually untrue and -- and -- and quite ridiculous, but also not talking about a plan for dealing with bringing down the cost of groceries, not talking about a plan for building up American businesses, not talking about a plan for strengthening America's security and standing with our allies and against our adversaries.

Right.

Yeah.

Yeah.

And, Howard, to your point, the bill is and would have been the strongest border security bill in years. It would have put 1,500 more border agents at the border. I've been down to the border. Those border agents are working around the clock. They need help.

They need support. And this bill would have done that. In fact, the Border Patrol agents have supported the bill. It would have stemmed the flow of fentanyl. I'm traveling our country meeting with mothers and fathers and children of people who have died because of fentanyl. This would have put the resources into stemming the flow of fentanyl coming into our country killing Americans.

It would have done work to allow us to go after transnational criminal organizations. I am a former prosecutor as you know. I have prosecuted transnational criminal organizations who are trafficking in guns, drugs, and human beings. This is not theoretical for me. I know what they do, and we should have the resources to go after them.

Yeah.

Prosecutor. Yeah, in Alameda County, the seat is Oakland, California.

Yeah.

You start with DUIs.

Yeah.

So, I started by actually -- the first case I actually prosecuted was when I was a certified law clerk. So, I -- and I won the case. But the great thing about, you know, just pushing people out when they're young --

They don't know any better.

I was nervous, and I was probably over-prepared. But I believed in my case. And, you know, the great thing about being a prosecutor and I've talked with many prosecutors over the years all over the country is you only got one job, which is to do the right thing.

And so, you have to believe in your case. And frankly, if you don't believe in your case, you shouldn't be bringing your case. Right? You shouldn't be charging a case unless you believe this person is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and you have the evidence to prove it. You shouldn't be making decisions based on emotion.

You should be making decisions based on facts and the law.

So, I believed in my case, but -- but that work actually -- I had a mentor Dick Iglehart, who actually hired me as a prosecutor right out of law school. And I was just telling somebody. So, the interview, you want to know what the interview was like?

So, I go into this courthouse. It's this storied courthouse in Oakland, California. And I go up to the ninth floor. And I go into this office, and there are a bunch of wooden chairs. And there are these guys who are behind the desk. And in these chairs around, one's got his leg up -- his foot up on one -- on the seat of the chair, leaning over, all these guys.

And I'm sitting in this little wooden chair, and they're asking me all these questions. It's my big interview. You know, what the interview was -- the questions were from? Do you remember that game Scruples?

That was my interview. So, asking you things like, "Well, if you were -- if you were a poor student and in an apartment, and then your neighbor says, 'Hey, I got a -- I got a hook up on cable,' and, you know, would you do it?" If you don't have to pay for questions like that, But that's -- that's how I started my career as a -- as a prosecutor.

Believing in the work, obviously.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

When I was in high -- well, just before high school.

Yeah.

Her stepfather.

Yeah.

I always knew I wanted to go to law school. I mean part of some of my heroes were people like Thurgood Marshall, you know who understood the power of the law to take the passion from the streets to the courtrooms. But when I decided I wanted to be a prosecutor, a big part of it had to do with Wanda's experience.

And I just felt like there has to be -- and I want to be part of a system that is protecting vulnerable people. And I --

Yeah, it is. And it's -- I don't know. I've always maybe -- I'm -- you know, I'm the eldest of two kids. You know, when I was two years starting from when I was 2-years-old, my mother would say look after your sister. You know, I've -- it's an instinct of mine to want to protect people.

Yeah.

Yeah. That wasn't for me.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yes.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

I mean, I've always been clear-eyed about what's involved. And, yeah, there is -- there -- there are threats and all of that, but the good that you can do standing in front of a jury and saying to that jury that this mother's child should not have been killed --

To say that this person who is engaged in human trafficking should pay a consequence, to say that, you know, that -- that people should receive dignity and -- and that there has to be serious consequence for serious crime, I just -- I think that's some of the most important work that anyone can do, which is to require that we have a society that does not allow, in particular, for -- for violence and that kind of behavior to go without consequence, serious consequence.

I have put a lot of people in jail. I have personally prosecuted everything from, you know, child sexual assault to homicides; and then, as attorney general, transnational criminal organizations, which I took on as a leader.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

It does.

It was one of the most difficult cases I've ever handled. I, to this day, remember exactly when I realized that that was what was going to happen. To this day, I remember where I was. I remember exactly how I felt, and I still -- I still think about that and her. You know, as a prosecutor, I spent -- I would go up to the -- the parents of homicide victims, would have a meeting every Thursday evening.

And no DA had gone up there. And I would go up and join them for their meetings

And talk with them about -- and basically figure out what we needed to do more to figure out who the killer of their child was and to be able to then bring those cases to justice. It's -- I think it's very important that we all agree that, look, as a society, there has to be a serious consequence for the one person killing another human being --

A woman being raped, a child being molested, there has to be serious consequence. And that's the work I've always done for the majority of my career, and I feel very strongly about it. And I think that people should be able to live in a society where they feel safe. I think of safety as a civil right.

And all people have the right to be safe because think about a society that doesn't have that, where then people are constantly worried about something unexpected happening to them. That's not going to be a productive society.

Yeah.

I've definitely had death threats.

Yeah. I don't generally talk about them, but --

Yes.

I refuse to live in fear of -- of -- of the bad guys.

I just -- I'm not going to -- I'm not doing that. I'm not doing that.

But here's the thing that is, again, really important that people understand about who Donald Trump is. He hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court to do exactly what they did, take away the right of an individual to make decisions about their own body. Like, I asked people to take a step back.

Let's -- let's just think about it this way. Let's -- whatever your gender --

And it's not about abortion. You have basically now a system that says you as an individual do not have the right to make a decision about your own body. The government has the right to make that decision for you. So, regardless of how you feel about abortion, think about what that means. You know, the -- the -- the strength of America includes that we have been committed, as Americans, as part of our spirit to the expansion of rights.

And for the first time, we're seeing a restriction of rights, fundamental rights, including what could be more fundamental than to make decisions about your own body. And that's what has happened. And, Howard, to your point, look, this is not this -- this issue is not about trying to convert people. Right?

Because one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree --

What the government shouldn't be telling her what to do with her body. She will talk with her priest, her pastor, her rabbi, her imam, but not the government about what to do.

Yeah.

But Clarence Thomas said it.

And to your point, think about it. You know, so I actually was proud to perform some of the first same-sex marriages as an elected official in 2004, OK?

A lot of people have evolved since then, but I did back in 2004. Here's how I think about it. We actually had laws that were treating people based on their sexual orientation differently. So, if you're a gay couple, you can't get married. We were basically saying that you are a second-class citizen under the law, not entitled to the same rights as a couple who are consenting adults in a loving relationship.

You, therefore, when one of you is sick when one, God forbid, passes away, will not have the same legal rights.

We were saying, literally, you're a second-class citizen under the law. And now, you see the court that Donald Trump created --

Openly talking about what else could be at risk. And understand, if Donald Trump were to get another term, most of the legal scholars think that there's going to be maybe even two more seats that will be up. That means, think about it, not for the next four years, for the next 40 years, for the next four generations of your family, what might be a Supreme Court that is about restricting your rights versus expanding your rights.

So, to your point, that's where everyone, I think, is starting to understand. This election is not 2016 or 2020 because that Supreme Court decision just a few months ago basically said to the former president, you will be immune from anything you do in office. Now, this is a guy who has said --

He'll be a dictator on day one.

Has said he would weaponize the Department of Justice, take away the independence of the Department of Justice, and put his loyalists in; somebody who has said -- literally, he would use this word. He uses this word. He would terminate the Constitution of the United States. You know what the Constitution of the United States does? That's the Fourth Amendment against unreasonable search and seizure.

That's the Fifth Amendment, which is your right to remain silent. That's the Sixth Amendment, your right to an attorney. And he's going to terminate the Constitution?

Howard, I'm doing everything I can to make sure he does not win.

You know what? All of those former officials from the national security, the over 200 Republicans, who worked with both Presidents Bush, Mitt Romney, John McCain, who are endorsing me; the former Vice President Dick Cheney, who was voting for me along with his daughter, Liz Cheney --

We are building a coalition of people that are Republicans, independents, Democrats libertarians, all stripes of Americans who are coming together to say, you know what, this election is about putting country before party; that this is about saying, do we want a President who's going to abide by the oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States, or someone who is full time engaged in flattery from Vladimir Putin of Russia and sending Covid testing kits over to him when Americans are dying every day.

Yeah.

You're right.

Yeah.

Yes.

Yes.

Yes.

But here's the thing, let's not throw up our hands, let's roll up our sleeves --

because this -- but this is our country. And you know what? If you love our country, we got to fight for our country. We can't take our country for granted. I love our country, I love the American people. And what I see when I'm traveling all over our country is that people are coming together of all different backgrounds based on a common belief that if you love something, you got to fight for it.

And -- and that's what this moment -- that's this moment.

And we are -- we can have our disagreements, but there's some foundational stuff that we got to agree on. And it includes rule of law. Free and fair elections should not be overturned just because you didn't like the outcome because you lost.

OK.

In America, we call that a sore loser. And in this case this is someone who has already lost, which would say that they are actually already a loser.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Oh, I love Doritos, original nacho. But let me just tell you, it was a family-sized bag.

I sat on the couch --

I work out every morning.

I did.

On the elliptical at the hotel.

Yeah.

Half an hour to 45 minutes.

I'm watching a variety of things. That's how I catch --

Yeah, sometimes. Yeah,

I do, too. Joe Scarborough, yeah.

Yes.

But he loves our country.

I don't agree with him on every issue, but we agree on the -- I think the most important at this moment for sure.

Well, no, so I don't eat raisin bran every morning.

But if you ask me what was my favorite cereal, I would put it right up there with -- OK. And then, this is going to be obnoxious and Special K.

Well, it's really great, plus my mother used to make these Special K cookies in honor of me.

Yeah. I miss her everyday.

I miss her every day.

Yeah, she was very special, all five feet of her. You would have loved her. If you met her, you would have thought she was 6-feet tall.

Correct.

Yeah.

That was my first job, and I was awful. She fired me.

Because I didn't want to do it. I didn't want to do it. I didn't want to clean pipettes, you know.

Yeah.

It was actually the flatlands of Berkeley at the time. But, yeah, they did.

When we arrived at school?

I didn't have that experience, in large -- you know, let me tell you, maybe this is one of the reasons why. My first grade teacher, Mrs. Frances Wilson, God rest her soul, attended my law school graduation. Yeah.

Yes.

Yes, I had relations -- yes. And it was --

Well, no, it's what she did. And that's what I'm saying so that -- you know, it was like -- I love teachers, I really do. They do God's work, think about it.

We don't pay them nearly enough.

And what is their calling? To teach other people's children. Right? So, when you ask me what was that like, what was the environment like, I think it was all of those incredible teachers who -- they set an example and they created an environment that was welcoming and nurturing. And, you know, I mean I'm very blessed to have been raised and -- and people I talked to who have achieved any level of success.

One of the things that I've found to be a theme is that, at some point, we were each told be it by a teacher or somebody at your church or synagogue, or a parent, but we were told, at some point, that we were special. And by the way, we were not particularly special. But somebody told us that and we believed them.

Right. Right. And -- and that's part of, you know, that's -- I had the blessing of, you know, in my childhood, especially in those really critical stages of development to have a teacher like Mrs. Wilson and in an environment that really told all the kids you can be and do anything.

Yeah.

I know.

Yeah.

This is my form of therapy right now.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Well, let me just tell you. I have -- I have the great fortune of having a really incredible group of friends. My best friend from kindergarten is still one of my best friends.

Yeah. I have an incredible husband. And so, I do have people in my life that I can talk to. And one of the things I -- I advise others is, you know, especially younger people, I mentor a lot of people, men and women --

Yeah. Well, just people I'll meet along the way who will express to me some goal or some desire they have, and I'll just make sure that I follow up with them. And one of the things I say and I believe is that we each should -- we should be conscious of the fact that there are certain choices we can make.

And one of them is about who we choose to be in our life in our inner circle. And so, choose to have people in your life in that inner circle who are supportive of you and who will encourage you, you know people who, when you trip will laugh with you when you trip, but then pick you back up and push you back out.

You have to be conscious of it. You have to be conscious of it. You know, to be very rudimentary, like choose not to have mean people in your life.

You know, just --

Well, I think that we just -- we should remember the good. And I don't mean to sound naive, but we have to remember the good we have so many hardworking, good people who I have the great experience of meeting every day. I'm -- for example, one of my passions is small businesses.

So, my mother worked full time. She worked long hours, and we lived on a nursery school above a child care center. And the woman who owned that, Mrs. Shelton, was our -- we called her our second mother. She helped my mother raise us. She was a small business owner. I grew up as a child knowing small business owners.

They are leaders in the community. They hire locally. They mentor. So, I have a real passion for small businesses. Wherever I go around the country, I try to visit small businesses. I'm telling you, Howard, around our country, all these people who are innovative, ambitious, they are optimistic, they are building, they are creating, they are obviously contributing to our economy like we have, this is the spirit of the American people.

And we are ambitious, and we are aspirational.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Well, we need to work on bringing prices down. I mean, part of my point is we need to go after price gouging.

I've done that before. You know, we got to go after the bad actors where they exist, especially during emergencies. I mean, these -- these storms and these hurricanes. I've seen it with wildfires in California, where, you know, when people are desperate in an emergency, some bad actors will jack up prices.

We need to go after them and, you know, stop them from taking advantage of desperate people.

Yeah, it's --

Well, they're going to -- you know, in moments of crisis, the predators will come out --

And you got to go after them.

Yes.

My husband, Doug, is one of the strongest, most self-actualized people, men I've known.

I did. I did. Doug, so let me tell you about Doug. Doug grew up in Jersey.

He worked for everything he had. He -- we have a picture of him when he was employee of the month at McDonald's.

I worked at McDonald's.

OK, I'll answer anything you have, but so -- but he worked for everything he has. And he has the best sense of humor. He's -- he's very -- I don't want to say simple, but he's -- he's really clear. He cares about family, he cares about working hard. He --

Yeah.

He was a lawyer. He started his own law firm.

So, we met on a blind date, my best friend set us up. That's how we met. And it turned out that we have friends in common that we separately knew, and then it all connected.

You know, there's -- it's kind of like roulette, right? Like, it might hit, it may not. And -- but look, I think that as people -- you know, I mean, I'm on the campaign trail, I'm at various things. And people will come up to me. I know you met your husband on a blind date. You got anybody for me?

Yes, he did.

He is -- I feel very fortunate to have a husband who is so -- he's just secure in his skin. He's not trying to be anything he's not. And, you know, he's an incredible father to the kids. He's just -- he's an incredible son to my in-laws.

He's just good people.

Yeah.

Listen, I've been the first and -- first woman in almost every position I've had.

So, I believe that men and women support women in leadership, and that's been my life experience, and that's why I'm running for president.

Yeah.

I didn't know that I was going to get it. And I -- you know, I obviously had put myself out as as being open to it --

And I was incredibly honored when he reached out to me and offered it to me.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah, he's such a good person.

History is going to show it was probably one of the most -- one of the rarest moments of any president to do with courage, with the deepest level of courage and love of country.

I'm at home. It's a Sunday afternoon in my workout clothes. My niece, her husband, and their two daughters were staying with us. And I made pancakes that morning. They were asking for extra bacon. I was getting it for them.

I love to cook.

And then, we had this puzzle we were working on. And so, we went to go work on the puzzle.

Yeah.

Oh, yeah, I love puzzle, especially with kids. It's so fun. So, we were working on the puzzle, and the phone rings. And it's Joe. And -- and so, I got up to take the call, and -- and then life changed.

Yeah.

We talked a couple of times that day. And that morning, I'd say probably for like half an hour. You know, and I mean the first thing I asked him, to be honest with you, is, "Are you sure?" Yeah.

Yeah, he did.

And he's still doing a great job.

He's not done. He's not done.

Yeah.

No. I made the decision. I made the decision. But --

Well, I had worked with him because, you know, he's also president of the -- of the Governors Association. So, we had been working together. And -- and then, I, obviously, met with him to talk with him about considering him for -- for my running mate. And let me just start with saying that there were a lot of incredible candidates.

And ultimately, my decision really was just my gut decision because none of the candidates lack for an incredible level of talent and experience. But the thing about Tim Walz is, you know, people would look at the two of us and think "What could they possibly have in common?" He grew up on one side of the country in a rural environment.

I grew up on another side of the country in a very urban environment. You know, we just look different. We look like we'd be very different.

We have so much in common.

But also, here's the thing, Howard.

He reminds me of the people I grew up with, different part of the country, maybe a different race, but hard working people, straight-talking, grounded in principles.

Yeah, but just good people.

Right. Like, good, solid, hardworking people. And I -- and I just -- that was very attractive to me about him.

Yes. Right. Yeah.

Look, listen, I know and I've been a decision-maker long enough to know that the best decisions I make are when I bring in a variety of perspectives that allow me to consider every angle and to -- to build consensus. That's the best way, as a leader, I believe, you make good decisions.

I got to win, Howard. I got to win.

I got to win.

And listen, but the thing about Liz Cheney, let me just say, she's remarkable. She's smart. She is a dedicated public servant. She has shown extraordinary courage --

In this moment where there's such violent divisive language that she would put herself out so publicly and say, "I'm country before party." And, you know, she and I don't agree on everything.

But the fundamentals, we do agree on.

Yeah.

Yeah.

But to your point, I've now met, as vice president, over 150 world leaders, presidents, prime ministers, chancellors, and kings. And part of what keeps me up at night is the knowledge, based on experience, America is so important to the rest of the world, Howard.

We are so important to the rest of the world.

We are a role model for what it means to be a democracy. So, we can look at other countries and our allies and our adversaries and say these are the principles that must be upheld. And while we uphold these principles, we will also be the strongest economy in the world. We will have the most lethal fighting force in the world.

All these things co-exist, but you've got to have a president who appreciates and understands that. On the issue of the military, we already discussed where Donald Trump is. He belittles the members of our military.

But -- right. You look at the economy. My plans for the economy, listen, I am a capitalist. I'm also a -- I am also a devout public servant that knows government can't do everything by itself.

My econ policies, Goldman Sachs to 16 Nobel laureates will tell you that my plans will strengthen our economy. Donald Trump's plans would weaken our economy, would inflate inflation, and would bring a recession on by the middle of next year.

Yeah.

It's --

It's the same old tired playbook, Howard. And I think most people are not going to be distracted by it. They want to know you have a plan for bringing prices down.

They want to know you have a plan for keeping America secure.

Yeah. Yeah.

Oh, I didn't know that.

A new one?

Good for you. Congratulations.

And -- and what does it do? It allows a young -- young parents to be able to buy a crib, a car seat. That stuff is expensive, the stuff that is so --

Necessary for that incredibly important phase of their child's development. And again, the return on the investment is profound.

Pro-family is about taking care of -- like I announced today, my plan to make sure that Medicare covers at-home elder care, because, probably, a lot of your listeners are in that sandwich generation.

Where they're taking care of young kids and their elder parents.

Absolutely.

Or your parent will not get the care they need. Or you're going to have to leave your job --

Which means you're going to reduce your income to, depending on what it is, almost nothing in terms of your household income to do what you want to do, which is to give your parent the dignity they deserve with care.

And look at what Donald Trump has been talking about for years. And look at his Project 2025, people should google it. I mean, what they're doing and what he's talking about in terms of attacking Social Security, Medicare, undoing the Affordable Care Act, and which means the insurance companies can come back and deny people with preexisting conditions, all of this is very real and very much at stake in this election.

So, I think Donald Trump is an unserious man, and the consequences of him being president again are brutally serious.

I did. I was very touched, I was very touched. I'm a huge fan, and -- and obviously, Doug is a huge fan from Jersey.

Yes.

You do? Yeah. Yeah.

He was an early -- he was one of the early environmentalists.

Yeah, no, yeah.

Well, I worked at McDonald's the year before.

The summer before.

You know, I mean, I -- it was -- it's an experience, right? I mean, I was doing the fries, and you got to watch the timer, and it's -- it's hard work. But honestly, Howard, I will say in all seriousness, the point about McDonald's for me is also -- you know, I was a college kid, and I was spending money. Right?

There were people who were working there, that was the source of their family's income.

Right? And -- and that's the thing that I think -- that's my takeaway about that experience as much as anything, which is we still got a lot of work to do to make sure that folks cannot just get by but get ahead. And that's why I'm so committed on what I call an opportunity economy.

Yeah.

Oh, yeah.

Yeah.

What's her name?

Ray. Hi, Ray.

Hi, Ray.

Thank you.

Anytime.

I'm honored. I'm honored to be on your show, Howard Stern.

It went well, it went well.

Whoopi behaved. And there was some -- you know, we had covered some serious topics, some fun topics. So, there was --

There were two kids in the audience who, during the break, confessed that they were playing hooky.

And so, I wrote them basically hall passes.

There you go.

Thank you.

I appreciate you. Thank you for the time.

Thank you for the time.

Yes.

Oh, my God. Have you been to the Sphere?

Well -- well, let me just say, basically, everyone should go in with a clear head.

But that's why I'm saying that.

Like, definitely go in and --

Correct.

Because it's a lot. Like, there's a lot of visual stimulation.

And then, I love U2. It actually -- it was a -- it was a surprise for Doug. Because we have been working and working and working. And he and I both -- this is the other one we have in common is U2. And so, as my surprise, he thought we were leaving Nevada from campaigning and heading back to DC. And then, we drove up the street to the Sphere.

And the band actually came and said hello. But it's -- it's extraordinary. You sit in there, and it's almost like Disneyland or Disney World where things just start to change around you.

And you feel -- like you lose a sense of gravity because of the -- it's really phenomenal --

Which is also what's interesting about it then is -- is, to your point about mics and all this stuff, you don't really need a lot of stage props because the props are all in the Sphere on the -- on the monitors.

You got to go see it. It's really --

It's really fantastic. It's an incredible work of -- of just technology. Yeah.

Yeah, I used to --

Yeah. And then -- but I collect it for our son, Cole, too, because he's now hip to everything. And so, when I try to -- so my small business tour, so I try to go wherever I am also if there's a record store.

And then, I'll pick up vinyl for him and bring it back for him.

Yeah.

Oh, so good.

We love it. Our whole family does.

And depending on -- no, God, no. No. Well, actually, I haven't been able to watch it a lot recently because I am campaigning because, you know, also depending on where they're driving, the time of day, you know, you got to wake up --

Lewis Hamilton, of course.

He's leaving Mercedes. You don't know -- you don't watch Formula 1? No?

Oh, it's you -- once you start, I think -- you should see it, you might get hooked.

It's good stuff.

No. Doug does. I don't.

I don't know because it's secret. What is it, Howard? I don't know.

Oh, yeah, Camp David. Well, historic site. By the way, you know --

Donald Trump invited the Taliban there, so --

Let's put that -- let's put that on that ledger.

I've never been.

No.

Yeah.

OK.

OK.

I hope to come back. Thank you so much.

OK. Thank you.
