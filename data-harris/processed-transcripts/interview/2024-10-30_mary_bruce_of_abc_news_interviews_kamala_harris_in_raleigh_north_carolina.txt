Well, first of all, I think that the president has explained what he meant. But I've -- I've said it earlier, I strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they vote for and --and that I've made that clear throughout my career and including my speech last night before I think this all happened, which is I intend to be a president for all Americans and including those who may not vote for me in this election.

I take very seriously my obligation and my oath to concern myself first with the needs of the American people and put them before whatever might be my selfish issues.
