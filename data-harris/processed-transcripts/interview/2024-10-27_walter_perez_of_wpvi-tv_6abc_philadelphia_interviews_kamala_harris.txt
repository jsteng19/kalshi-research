Overall, to really understand that I think America is ready for a new way forward, that is a new generation of leadership built on optimism.

Black voters are no different than any other voter. They're going to focus on the issues and that is why I am here talking with folks understanding that they actually want a leader who is focused on solutions.

I know what the press likes to talk about, but the experience that I'm having, when I look at, for example, the rally that I did just two days ago when 30,000 people showed up, there were people of both genders of every race, every background, every age.

The choice, Philly, is truly in your hands. And your vote is your voice and your voice is your power.
