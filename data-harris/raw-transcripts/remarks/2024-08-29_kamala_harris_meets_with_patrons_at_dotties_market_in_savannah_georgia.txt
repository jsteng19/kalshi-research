Kamala Harris: OK. [Inaudible] tables here?

Chris Meenan: During the day, it's kind of like a casual like hangout coffee shop. Then at night, people have reservations. They come sit down, they have a server. We do the whole restaurant thing.

Kamala Harris: Yeah. And you have like regulars that come all the time.

Ericka Phillips: We've been surprised [Inaudible] because it's mostly like a tourist. It's kind of one of the main streets, you know?

Kamala Harris: Right, right. So, this is what small businesses -- right. It's like you know who your regulars are. You know when I'm having a good day, when I'm having a challenging day, right? You know what they like to order.

Chris Meenan: There's just too many like -- there's too many like [Inaudible] in like main streets in America.

And now, it's like less and less, more and more chains.

Ericka Phillips: People are really usually surprised [Inaudible].

Chris Meenan: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: But you have to be -- I'm telling you. This is one of my single priorities is to invest and grow our small businesses. So, what I'm going to be rolling out next week is basically a tax credit for start-ups, for small businesses. We're starting -- half of America's working population either owns, runs, or works in a small business. I mean, when we think about strengthening the economy as a whole, not to mention really investing in like the ambition and the dreams -- I mean, that's -- all of that is what you guys are doing and creating dreams in the process, right?

Ericka Phillips: Absolutely. And [Inaudible] coming up. You know, teens and 20s who's working for small businesses and what I learned so much by being in that kind of close, intimate relationship with, you know [Inaudible].

Kamala Harris: But about business and about community, right?

Ericka Phillips: Absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah. How to take care of people.

Kamala Harris: Well -- so, my second mother who taught me how to make gumbo, she didn't have a restaurant, but she had a small business. She was -- she had a day care center. And she would, you know -- the local mother or father who was having challenges, she would come and take care of them. It's up and down. She was a matriarch of the community. She would hire locally. She would, you know, scold and discipline everybody's children.

Ericka Phillips: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: But it was part of the community, right? It's what holds the community together. [Crosstalk]

Ericka Phillips: [Inaudible] feel like people are [Inaudible] at this times in this fast-paced digital age that's creating those connections.

Kamala Harris: Right.

Chris Meenan: And it builds community. I mean, Cheryl Day is sitting right over there. She had a very famous bakery for years. The whole neighborhood grew up --

Unidentified: There's a cookbook.
