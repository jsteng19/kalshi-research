Unidentified: Awesome.

Kamala Harris: You know, ours -- as we talk about it, because it's just what it is, we are a people-powered campaign. And it is about understanding the power of each one of us to lift folks up, to let them know they are seen, they are heard. I think there's so much that has happened in our country that makes people feel like they're alone or they're not seen or that we have nothing in common when, in fact, we all know we have so much more in common than what separates us.

Unidentified: That's right.
