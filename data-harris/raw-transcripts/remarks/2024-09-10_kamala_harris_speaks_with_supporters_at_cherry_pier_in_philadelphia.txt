Doug Emhoff: [Applause] And now, we're going to take this momentum for the next 55 days so I can call my wife, the next president of the United States, Kamala Harris.

Kamala Harris: I started the debate by talking about it and it became apparent, I think, throughout that hour and a half. Look, this is very much two different visions for our country. [Audience responds affirmatively] Ours, which is a vision for the future. [Audience responds affirmatively] And his speeches about the past and taking us backward.

Kamala Harris: And as I said on the debate stage, we are not going back. [Audience calls out "We are not going back."] This is a campaign born out of love of country. We love our country. We believe in who we are. We believe in the American people. This is a campaign about bringing folks together, knowing the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. [Audience member calls out "Inclusion"]

Kamala Harris: It is about inclusion, and it is not about division, and it is not about demeaning and name calling. It is about lifting folks up, working folks, families, children, people who are just not just trying to get by, but trying to get ahead. That's what we stand for. So, let's get out of here for these next 56 days.

Kamala Harris: Hard work is good work, and we will win. We will win. See you later.
