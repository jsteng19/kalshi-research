Kamala Harris: Where's your family? What's going on with your family?

Angelica Wind: Well, right now, we don't have any power -- well, we just got power, but we had no water, power, and no cell phone service. And there's still a lot of folks missing. And there are a lot of people that are grieving and hurting.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Angelica Wind: But there's also a lot of resilience.

Kamala Harris: That's right.

Angelica Wind: There's a lot of resilience. The community's coming together. We are organizing -- NC Council is doing what they can to get resources to that area. The members are doing donation drives. That means so much for our community.

Kamala Harris: Yeah. And you're here --

Angelica Wind: And we're just surviving, yeah. And I've got my daughter and her friend who came so they try to get a couple of days of normalcy --

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Angelica Wind: Yeah, yeah.

Kamala Harris: Right?

Angelica Wind: Yes, absolutely.

Kamala Harris: Right.

Angelica Wind: And we're grateful for all the support that you have given us. We still need a lot more. We want to make sure that people don't forget about us --

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Angelica Wind: And so -- but grateful that you're here and that we're going to get to work together --

Angelica Wind: Thank you.

Kamala Harris: OK?

Angelica Wind: Thank you so much.

Kamala Harris: We're here for the long haul. And I've been meeting with the governor, and we've got the administrator for FEMA's here on the ground. And just -- and the mayor was there in the meeting, as well as Mayor Lyles. And we're putting just all hands on deck --

Angelica Wind: Thank you, thank you.

Kamala Harris: To make sure that you and your family and your neighbors and everyone have everything that they need in the --

Angelica Wind: Thank you. And we see the -- we see the -- the resources coming. We need a lot more.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Angelica Wind: And again, going back to be grateful that I work for an organization that is mobilizing folks --

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Angelica Wind: That are working with trusted, messengers, trusted organizations on the ground that have access --

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Angelica Wind: And relationships with some of the most vulnerable communities there.

Kamala Harris: That's right.

Angelica Wind: And we just got to keep doing it. We're -- together, we're stronger.

Kamala Harris: That's right.

Angelica Wind: Thank you. Thank you.

Unidentified: [inaudible] nice to meet you.

Kamala Harris: Kamala Harris, nice to meet you. OK, I don't want to slow down the production line. So, put me to work.

Unidentified: OK. All right.

Kamala Harris: OK, what are we doing?

Unidentified: So, we're making care packages, all right.

Kamala Harris: OK.

Unidentified: So, we got a nice little line going.

Kamala Harris: Indeed.

Unidentified: I'm going to put in the toothbrush --

Kamala Harris: OK.

Unidentified: The toothpaste, and then I'm going to pass you the bag.

Kamala Harris: OK.

Unidentified: And you're going to put in a deodorant.

Unidentified: Queen and I -- Queen Melissa.

Kamala Harris: I got it.

Unidentified: OK?

Kamala Harris: OK. I got it.

Unidentified: All right.

Kamala Harris: OK.

Unidentified: First bag. Thank you. Your bag. [inaudible] [inaudible] you're a worker.

Kamala Harris: I'm a worker.

Unidentified: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: OK. I will slow down. Put that right there. OK. Thank you.

Unidentified: So, we've been [inaudible] resources for over a week -- or no, an entire week now. This is our hub, and we're really grateful for our community partners that gave us a space.

Kamala Harris: So, you have different sources of donations, right?

Unidentified: We do.

Kamala Harris: For this effort.

Unidentified: We do.

Kamala Harris: And then, how do -- how do you actually then centralize it?

Unidentified: So, people do drop-offs. What we're actually transitioning to is -- NC Counts Coalition, we have 135 member organizations, grassroots, across the state. They are collecting donations, and they will drop it off at the central hub. And then we run trucks to pick it up.

Kamala Harris: And bring it all together.

Unidentified: Exactly.

Kamala Harris: And then, you have these production lines --

Unidentified: Exactly.

Kamala Harris: And then, how do we get the packages out?

Unidentified: Truck drivers. Well, actually, this is one of our truck drivers -- Queen here -- Queen here. She really is, and MJ.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Unidentified: Yes. [inaudible] runs from here in Asheville. And so, you know, they pack up the van and go on away. And our members on the ground there, they receive it directly. So, it doesn't go to --

Kamala Harris: Right. It's not filtered through any --

Unidentified: Exactly. Yeah. Like, we have a text thread with everyone who has been impacted. They tell us what they need.

Kamala Harris: So, you get it directly to individuals?

Unidentified: We get it directly to individuals. And they --

Kamala Harris: So, what's that been like?

Unidentified: Well, honestly, when we went up the first day, I was familiar because I used to live in Asheville. And we made the first stop in Morganton. And MJ and I drove up, and I was, like, "Where do we -- where is the drop-off?" I need to back up where they drop off their supplies. Me thinking that it's -- they're going to have all these supplies.

Unidentified: And she come out when our community members come out. And she was like, "Oh, my goodness, I'm so glad y'all are here." Come to find out we were the only one.

Kamala Harris: Really?

Unidentified: We were the only one, and they had three tents.

Kamala Harris: So, they didn't even have a center of where to do it because you were the only one.

Unidentified: They were the only -- we were the only one. They had three tents set up outside and about -- I guess maybe they had about 20 cases of water. And that was it. And what -- I think what -- really what really got me was the 16-year-old daughter came up and seen a -- what we had, we take pads and put like five or 10 in a bag.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Unidentified: And she was like, "Oh, my God. We got some pads."

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Unidentified: And you know, it's a female. We know how valuable that is.

Kamala Harris: Yeah. That's true.

Unidentified: And she said -- because they were in Morganton, not in Asheville, that no one had brought them anything. And their water just came back on, but it was black and dirty.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Unidentified: So, they were still needing it. So it's been -- it's been -- it's been challenging. But that's -- you know, NC Counts, we run into the fire, not away from the fire.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Unidentified: So --

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Unidentified: We're doing it, and we'll be making some more trips.

Kamala Harris: That's [inaudible]

Unidentified: And we'll keep making them trips.

Kamala Harris: That's right.

Unidentified: And we got to take care of our communities.

Kamala Harris: Well, you all are the heroes among us because I do believe, in moments of crisis, the heroes are revealed, who just step up to help people in need and -- and to show that kind of strength that -- that people need to feel in each other.

Unidentified: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: Yeah, that's really important.

Angelica Wind: And one of the things that NC Counts does is that we're in continual contact with the organizations that are on the ground because what's going to happen is the needs are going to evolve as the recovery evolves.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Angelica Wind: And so, right now, we're in active crisis. But eventually, with the recovery, the needs differ. And so --

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Angelica Wind: That's why we continue to communicate with the -- what has changed, what do you need, what has sprung up. And we try to be as nimble and responsive as possible.

Kamala Harris: So, so far, their -- probably the needs are pretty consistent, right? Or are you saying --

Angelica Wind: We're starting -- we're at -- first, a lot of the focus was on water to drink and food --

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Angelica Wind: Nonperishable food. And now, we're moving toward needing more stabilization because water will not be present for some time. And so, now, we're looking to see how we can get more porta-potties in communities where transportation is an issue.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Angelica Wind: In the city of Asheville, we depended a lot on transportation.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Angelica Wind: But the buses aren't running.

Kamala Harris: Right.

Angelica Wind: And so, we need to get more porta-potties in these vulnerable communities, right?

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Angelica Wind: But we are continuing to --

Kamala Harris: You know, part of the announcement I made today includes $100 million in federal money going to rebuild.
