Kamala Harris: Volunteered your time to help organize this work that is about finding ourselves and each other, that we are all in this together. It is so extremely important. Many of you have heard my speeches many times, and one of the things that I talked about and mean so sincerely and you all are putting into action is the fact that real leadership is about lifting each other up.

And the work that you all are doing, yes, it is about this election, knock on wood, God-willing, we are going to win.

Kamala Harris: We are building coalitions. [Audience member calls out "Yeah"] We are reminding people of one of the motivations behind our campaign, which is we all have so much more in common than what separates us. [Audience responds affirmatively] [Audience member calls out "Right"] And that we are going to, as we all say, turn the page [Audience member calls out "Yes"] on an era that was about trying to have people point fingers at each other, trying to suggest that there is -- there are these issues that divide us when the most fundamental important issues we care about unify us.

Kamala Harris: And so, you all are putting that into action every moment of each day you've been doing this work. We have 13 days to go, and I am so deeply thankful to you. You are having an impact on, for the most part, people that you may never end up meeting because your work here will impact people around the country. Understand that.
