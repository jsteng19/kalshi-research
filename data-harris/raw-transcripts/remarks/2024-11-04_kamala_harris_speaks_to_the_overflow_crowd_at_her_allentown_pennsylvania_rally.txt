Kamala Harris: Hey, Allentown! Hi, everybody. [Laughs] Hi. Hi. Hi. Hey, everyone. Hi. Oh, it's so good to see everybody. Thank you all. Thank you. Are we ready to do this? Are we ready to vote? Are we ready to win? All right. Well, we're going to get to work. We are going to get to work. We've got 24 hours to go. And, Allentown, you are going to make the difference.

Kamala Harris: The path to the White House runs through this room right here. And -- and sincerely, I want to thank everyone for taking the time out of your lives to be here -- and all the work that you have been doing, the work we will continue to do. I'm going to say it in that room, but I needed to come here and say to you all here.

Kamala Harris: Over these next 24 hours, I say to all the leaders who are here, let's get out there. Let's remind people of the power that they have through their vote. Their vote is their voice about the future of our country, because we are fighting to move forward. We love our country, and we are going to see this through.

Kamala Harris: And in the process, we are going to build community, and we are going to build coalitions. And we are going to remind each other we are all in this together. And I thank you all so, so very much. Please take care. I'll see you on the other side of it all. All right? Thank you. God bless you. God bless you. Thank you. Thank you.
