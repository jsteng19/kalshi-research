Joe Biden: THE VICE PRESIDENT: So, I want to address what's happened over the last few hours in terms of the Middle East and be very clear: Israel has a right to defend itself. And I unequivocally support Israel's right to remain secure and -- and to defend the security of Israel.

Joe Biden: What we know in particular is, yes, it has a right to defend itself against a terrorist organization, which is exactly what Hezbollah is. But all of that being said, we still must work on a diplomatic solution to end these attacks, and we will continue to do that work.

Joe Biden: Thank you, all.
