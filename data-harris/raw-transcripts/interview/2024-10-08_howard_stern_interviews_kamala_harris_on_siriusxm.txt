Anything from 'Diamonds and Pearls', 'Purple Rain' with special mention of 'I Could Never Take the Place of Your Man' from 'Sign o` the Times' is measurably superior, at a minimum.]

Howard Stern: Playing the "Batdance" for Madam Vice President. Do you -- well, we'll listen to this for a second. First of all, it's me, Howard. I'm here on a special day. I was supposed to have a day off. I'd only come in for the vice president of the United States. Because right now is my nap time.

Kamala Harris: Well, try not to fall asleep during this interview.

Howard Stern: Do you nap at all?

Kamala Harris: Not really, I wish I could.

Howard Stern: I can --

Kamala Harris: I don't mind, you know, like, in a different life, you know, sometimes on a Sunday afternoon. Yeah.

Howard Stern: I know. Look, what you -- by the way I'm playing "Batdance" because I knew you were a Prince fan.

Kamala Harris: Yes

Howard Stern: But I believe -- I'm a huge Prince fan, but I believe that the "Batman" soundtrack was his best work.

Kamala Harris: Really?

Howard Stern: It was genius. Yes. Think about it. Listen to this. You didn't -- it didn't do it for you?

Kamala Harris: No, not -- I mean, no. I mean, like, obviously, like 1999, I thought, was spectacular. You can go back to his early days.

Howard Stern: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: But like him on the guitar, there was just nothing like it. And so many people have -- I mean, even you look at Bruno Mars today, right?

Howard Stern: Right.

Kamala Harris: Who -- who've just been influenced by Prince. You know the night he passed, Doug and I were in LA and actually just -- like, he and I have very different musical tastes, my husband and I.

Howard Stern: What's Doug into like Cream or --

Kamala Harris: Depeche Mode

Howard Stern: Oh, Depeche Mode.

Kamala Harris: It's just -- yeah, that's him.

Howard Stern: All right.

Kamala Harris: I grew up kind of hip-hop. And -- but Prince is the one intersection where we both love. And we just played Prince all night long. We danced, we sang his songs, it was -- that was our little tribute.

Howard Stern: Did you ever meet Prince in real life?

Kamala Harris: I never met him in real life.

Howard Stern: Wow. I went to see him. This is such a weird story. I -- forget me -- forget my story, but --

Kamala Harris: Tell me, though, I want to hear it.

Howard Stern: Well, it's very strange because I was a huge Prince fan like you.

Kamala Harris: Yeah. Yeah.

Howard Stern: And a friend called me who had worked on a book with him, the pictures, and they said, "Prince is going to perform for about 150 people. Come over." And I said, "I'm going."

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Howard Stern: I go over. He comes out, and he announces to the crowd turn off all the lights. And he's playing in the dark --

Kamala Harris: Right.

Howard Stern: The entire time. I left. I said, "This is ridiculous. I could listen to this on the radio." He wouldn't -- he didn't want to be seen.

Kamala Harris: And he wanted you to feel it with your ears and your spirit instead of your eyes, right?

Howard Stern: But ridiculous. I'm -- I'm finally going to see Prince. You know, it --

Kamala Harris: What time of night was it? You know, he was famously a night owl.

Howard Stern: It was early. It was early.

Kamala Harris: It was?

Howard Stern: Yeah, it was an early session. It was like a special promotional thing. You know, it makes me think of you because you've said sort of running for office, even when you ran, you know, as a DA --

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Howard Stern: Or attorney general, it was like you said, "I don't like talking about myself. It feels -- I was raised not to be a narcissist." And here you're -- you know, the other guy is so openly talking about himself. But it's weird. It's odd for you to talk about your accomplishments and sort of congratulate yourself.

Kamala Harris: I just have always -- and you're right, I was raised this way. It's not about you, it's about what you do. Right?

Howard Stern: Right.

Kamala Harris: And -- and so, it is. It feels immodest to me to talk about myself, which apparently I'm doing right now.

Howard Stern: Right. But you have to, right?

Kamala Harris: Yeah. You do, you do.

Howard Stern: I mean this it, you're running for office

Kamala Harris: And a friend of mine actually said, "Look, this is not a time to worry about modesty because this is, you know, obviously, you got to let people know who you are."

Howard Stern: When you said you don't nap, I get it because like what you've taken on is extraordinarily difficult. And I mean, do you feel the pressure of the moment in the sense that -- like when I met you out in the hall, I said I'm really nervous because I want this to go well for you. I want it to go well for the country.

Howard Stern: Even when I watch them on "Saturday Night Live" with the -- where they have Maya Rudolph playing you --

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Howard Stern: I hate it. I don't want you being made fun of. I -- there's too much at stake. I believe the entire future of this country right now. I mean as America land of the free, home of the brave, I think it's literally on the line.

Kamala Harris: I agree with you.

Howard Stern: And when I see them -- how did you react to this "Saturday Night Live" bit?

Kamala Harris: Well, I just saw it actually, and it was funny. I am a huge fan of Maya Rudolph. I think she put a lot of time into to doing the -- the piece and -- and the character. But to your point, I literally lose sleep and have been over what is at stake in this election. I mean, honestly, I -- I end the day pretty much every day these days asking myself what can I do more?

Howard Stern: Yeah. And what can you do? I mean --

Kamala Harris: The stakes are so high.

Howard Stern: You're going out, you're -- you're coming here. You're going -- you went on "The View" this morning.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Howard Stern: You're going to the shows. You did "60 Minutes." By the way, I thought what was so amazing about "60 Minutes" is the fact that Trump turned it down.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Howard Stern: I mean it just says so much. He didn't want to be fact checked. This is maddening, this is insanity. What do you mean you don't want to be fact checked?

Kamala Harris: I think that -- you know, Howard, people ask me, like, "What do you think is going on, and what -- what is the tension here? What's at stake?" And there are many things and I can be much more articulate than what I'm going to say. But, ultimately, I do believe that this is an election that is about strength versus weakness.

Howard Stern: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: And weakness as projected by someone who puts himself in front of the American people and does not have the strength to stand in defense of their needs, their dreams, their desires. The work that must happen to make sure that we are a secure nation, that we are nurturing and protecting our alliances around the world, that we are supporting America's military, that we are fighting to bring the cost of living down for working families, that we are building businesses, building growth --

Howard Stern: Did you ever think in your lifetime you would see a Republican not supporting NATO and wanting to disassemble NATO? I mean, what world are we living in? This is all weird.

Kamala Harris: And NATO -- NATO, which is the greatest military alliance the world has ever known.

Howard Stern: It's what my father's --

Kamala Harris: You want to talk about strength?

Howard Stern: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: That is strength to -- to -- to embrace that alliance as America -- as Americans. And he would walk away because he admires dictators --

Howard Stern: Well, what did you think --

Kamala Harris: More than he does our allies.

Howard Stern: What did you think of this thing that just came out today that Bob Woodward's book was saying that Trump was sending COVID tests to Putin, and Putin said, "Don't let anyone know." I mean, this is -- what is going on? What do you make of that?

Kamala Harris: So, I actually said it even in the debate. I believe that Donald Trump has this desire to be a dictator. He admires strongmen, and he gets played by them because he thinks that they're his friends,

Howard Stern: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: And they are manipulating him full time and manipulating him by flattery --

Howard Stern: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: And with favor. And so in the midst -- to your point, as reported by Bob Woodward, in the height of the pandemic, and remember and your listeners will remember, people were dying by the hundreds.

Howard Stern: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: We -- everybody was scrambling to get these kits, the tests, the COVID test kits.

Howard Stern: You couldn't get them.

Kamala Harris: Couldn't get them.

Howard Stern: Right.

Kamala Harris: Couldn't get them anywhere.

Howard Stern: Right.

Kamala Harris: And this guy, who was president of the United States, is sending them to Russia to a murderous dictator for his personal use?

Howard Stern: We only wish Putin would have gotten COVID and dropped dead well. I wished that.

Kamala Harris: Well, the point being that is just the most recent stark example of who Donald Trump is, that he secretly sent COVID test kits for the personal use of Putin of Russia, an adversary to the United States, when he was talking about Americans should be putting bleach in their blood. Think about what this is.

Kamala Harris: Think about this -- this person who wants to be president again, who secretly is helping out an adversary when the American people are dying by the hundreds every day and in need of relief. And instead, how did he handle it domestically from Americans, he mismanaged the whole thing.

Howard Stern: This is what keeps me up at night. I don't understand how my fellow Americans -- I don't even understand how this election is close. And, yes, I'm voting for you, but I would also vote for that wall over there rather than a guy who says I -- you know, where do I begin? A guy who says he doesn't support Ukraine, wouldn't get on that stage with you and say I -- Ukraine.

Howard Stern: This is -- and why do my fellow Americans want this kind of chaos overseas? Why?

Kamala Harris: To your point, doesn't support our friend, Ukraine; doesn't support, therefore, something America should always and has always, by the way, been a champion of, which is the importance of sovereignty and territorial integrity, which means the importance of standing against anyone who tries to take another nation by force.

Howard Stern: Right.

Kamala Harris: That's what we stand for as Americans that you don't do that. And if you do that to our friends, we're going to stand with our friends. It's a -- you're getting played, and some would say -- look, I grew up in the neighborhood. Some would say you're getting punked.

Howard Stern: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: If you stand in favor of somebody who's an adversary over your friends on principles that we all agree on. And you look at it -- it's -- it's -- not only that. He says he's going to be a dictator on day one. But understand what dictators do. They jail journalists. They -- they put people who are protesting in the street in jail.

Howard Stern: He -- he said he thinks he wants to go after Jimmy Kimmel, a comedian. He wants to go after Stephen Colbert and Seth Meyers. What -- you know, even if someone had said years ago, when -- when -- I remember presidential, you know, races, if someone said, "Oh, Kamala Harris isn't a Black woman," they would have been out of the -- they would have been out of the --

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Howard Stern: That would have been it. It would have been over. I mean what -- who -- who -- how -- how do you challenge that? How do you -- what do you do with that?

Kamala Harris: But back to the point about what it actually is, and then let's talk about it and call it what it is, it's a sign of weakness in a leader.

Howard Stern: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: To not stand in defense of your people, the American people. It's a sign of weakness in the commander-in-chief of the United States of America to not stand on the side of supporting your military. Don't forget Donald Trump calling members of our military prisoners of war, suckers and losers.

Howard Stern: John McCain.

Kamala Harris: Absolutely.

Howard Stern: He doesn't like him.

Kamala Harris: Absolutely.

Howard Stern: Because he -- because he got captured.

Kamala Harris: He says he doesn't like him because "I don't like people who got caught." A prisoner of war, an American hero.

Howard Stern: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: Think about this guy who -- by the way, his former chief of staff, two secretaries of defense, his national security advisor, people who served with Donald Trump in the White House have said he is unfit to be commander-in-chief and is dangerous. So, the people who know him best have let us know they've seen them, they've worked with him in the Oval Office, and they know he is dangerous and unfit to be president of the United States.

Howard Stern: I mean, his own vice President isn't voting for him.

Kamala Harris: That's exactly right.

Howard Stern: I mean, how could anyone justify any of this? I don't get it. It's madness. And I know Donald Trump so many years. He was at my wedding. I always had a good time with him, but not as president of the United States. You can't -- you can't come out with these wacky eating cats and dogs. And now these poor people who are living in these communities are getting threatened.

Kamala Harris: You know, Howard --

Howard Stern: You cant dine with Nazis. You can't do it.

Kamala Harris: The -- the -- the thing about the cats and dogs -- and again --

Howard Stern: Oh, did you -- when you were doing the debate --

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Howard Stern: He makes -- what was going through your mind? When he said the cats and dogs, did you say to yourself, "I just -- I just won this thing, this guy's self-destructing?" What -- did you say it to yourself? Or did you not know in the moment?

Kamala Harris: There were a couple of moments at least in the debate where it was surreal, honestly.

Howard Stern: Right.

Kamala Harris: We're in a debate before it turned out, I think, 60 million Americans who are tuning in, meaning they're not dealing with all of their other priorities because they want to hear a debate about who will be the next president of the United States. And they want to know where do they stand on the issues and how will they lead and how will they make a difference in my life.

Howard Stern: Right.

Kamala Harris: And one of those two people, Donald Trump, on that stage spent time talking about how people are eating pets. One of those people on stage spent full time talking about his personal grievances, about himself full time, instead of talking about the needs of the American people. And I actually there were moments when I was on that debate stage where I was -- you know, I knew what he -- he does at his rallies, but this was a very serious moment.

Howard Stern: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: To earn the votes of the American people. And he was talking about things that were factually untrue and -- and -- and quite ridiculous, but also not talking about a plan for dealing with bringing down the cost of groceries, not talking about a plan for building up American businesses, not talking about a plan for strengthening America's security and standing with our allies and against our adversaries.

Howard Stern: When I was watching the debate, what drove me nuts, and I was there debating with you, I was like, say this, say that, and you said it. You said this guy is talking -- his big issue is immigration. OK, fair enough. There's an immigration problem. And you made the point. You said, "You know, it's great that you're for immigration, but we had this fantastic bill that would have secured the border."

Kamala Harris: Right.

Howard Stern: Republicans and Democrats did it together. But you picked up the phone and called the Republicans and say, 'Reject your own bill.' Now, when you say something like that, you think it would be the end of the discussion. The guy put his campaign ahead of -- we could have solved this big problem.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Howard Stern: We would have had the resources, the money, everything.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Howard Stern: And yet, he's somehow -- during the debate, it somehow just goes away. But that -- I mean, to me, it should be like we don't move on until we answer that. How -- why did you cancel the bill?

Kamala Harris: And, Howard, to your point, the bill is and would have been the strongest border security bill in years. It would have put 1,500 more border agents at the border. I've been down to the border. Those border agents are working around the clock. They need help.

Howard Stern: Right.

Kamala Harris: They need support. And this bill would have done that. In fact, the Border Patrol agents have supported the bill. It would have stemmed the flow of fentanyl. I'm traveling our country meeting with mothers and fathers and children of people who have died because of fentanyl. This would have put the resources into stemming the flow of fentanyl coming into our country killing Americans.

Howard Stern: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: It would have done work to allow us to go after transnational criminal organizations. I am a former prosecutor as you know. I have prosecuted transnational criminal organizations who are trafficking in guns, drugs, and human beings. This is not theoretical for me. I know what they do, and we should have the resources to go after them.

Howard Stern: Don't you want to say to his -- the people who support him, what are you not hearing? Are you not hearing that we had a bill to solve this big problem? You're all afraid of this, understood. We understand that. I mean, I -- I hear these interviews with people who are voting in the other direction, and I don't understand.

Howard Stern: There's no -- there's -- there's no -- it's all chaos. It doesn't make any sense to me. Speaking about being a district attorney and a prosecutor, I'm curious about that phase of your life.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Howard Stern: So, you go to law school. And really, it's sort of against all odds, but -- but what's fascinating to me is you get out of law school, and you get a job as a, you know, a prosecutor.

Kamala Harris: Prosecutor. Yeah, in Alameda County, the seat is Oakland, California.

Howard Stern: And -- and what is it -- what prepares you to go -- in other words, at first, I assume you go in front of a jury --

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Howard Stern: And they give you some kind of easy case, I'm hoping, like maybe --

Kamala Harris: You start with DUIs.

Howard Stern: DUI.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Howard Stern: Were you a wreck the first time out of law school and you go in front of a real jury, in front of a real judge, and you have to prosecute, even though it's a DUI? What -- what is that moment like for you?

Kamala Harris: So, I started by actually -- the first case I actually prosecuted was when I was a certified law clerk. So, I -- and I won the case. But the great thing about, you know, just pushing people out when they're young --

Howard Stern: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: They don't know any better.

Howard Stern: You weren't nervous.

Kamala Harris: I was nervous, and I was probably over-prepared. But I believed in my case. And, you know, the great thing about being a prosecutor and I've talked with many prosecutors over the years all over the country is you only got one job, which is to do the right thing.

Howard Stern: Right.

Kamala Harris: And so, you have to believe in your case. And frankly, if you don't believe in your case, you shouldn't be bringing your case. Right? You shouldn't be charging a case unless you believe this person is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and you have the evidence to prove it. You shouldn't be making decisions based on emotion.

Kamala Harris: You should be making decisions based on facts and the law.

Howard Stern: Right.

Kamala Harris: So, I believed in my case, but -- but that work actually -- I had a mentor Dick Iglehart, who actually hired me as a prosecutor right out of law school. And I was just telling somebody. So, the interview, you want to know what the interview was like?

Howard Stern: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: So, I go into this courthouse. It's this storied courthouse in Oakland, California. And I go up to the ninth floor. And I go into this office, and there are a bunch of wooden chairs. And there are these guys who are behind the desk. And in these chairs around, one's got his leg up -- his foot up on one -- on the seat of the chair, leaning over, all these guys.

Kamala Harris: And I'm sitting in this little wooden chair, and they're asking me all these questions. It's my big interview. You know, what the interview was -- the questions were from? Do you remember that game Scruples?

Howard Stern: Yeah. That was the question.

Kamala Harris: That was my interview. So, asking you things like, "Well, if you were -- if you were a poor student and in an apartment, and then your neighbor says, 'Hey, I got a -- I got a hook up on cable,' and, you know, would you do it?" If you don't have to pay for questions like that, But that's -- that's how I started my career as a -- as a prosecutor.

Howard Stern: But -- but the career --

Kamala Harris: Believing in the work, obviously.

Howard Stern: But the career really started, your mom, single mom, you know, working hard. We --

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Howard Stern: We've -- we've read a lot about your mother.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Howard Stern: Bright woman, scientist, chemist --

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Howard Stern: Father was also an academic.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Howard Stern: You know, bright people.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Howard Stern: But your mother moves you to Montreal, I think, it was?

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Howard Stern: In Canada.

Kamala Harris: When I was in high -- well, just before high school.

Howard Stern: Yeah. So, when you're there, one of your friends was sexually molested --

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Howard Stern: By a relative.

Kamala Harris: Her stepfather.

Howard Stern: Stepfather.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Howard Stern: And it was then you knew you wanted to go to law school because you wanted to be the person that people turned to when they were in dire straits.

Kamala Harris: I always knew I wanted to go to law school. I mean part of some of my heroes were people like Thurgood Marshall, you know who understood the power of the law to take the passion from the streets to the courtrooms. But when I decided I wanted to be a prosecutor, a big part of it had to do with Wanda's experience.

Kamala Harris: And I just felt like there has to be -- and I want to be part of a system that is protecting vulnerable people. And I --

Howard Stern: Yeah, and it's public service.

Kamala Harris: Yeah, it is. And it's -- I don't know. I've always maybe -- I'm -- you know, I'm the eldest of two kids. You know, when I was two years starting from when I was 2-years-old, my mother would say look after your sister. You know, I've -- it's an instinct of mine to want to protect people.

Howard Stern: But I think that's what people need to know. Certainly, to me, you know, public service is such a great thing. But when you graduate law school and, you know, you have to pay a lot of money to go to law school --

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Howard Stern: The temptation is to take a big corporate job

Kamala Harris: Yeah. That wasn't for me.

Howard Stern: Yeah, but that's the difference.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Howard Stern: That's another thing I really like about you. And -- and, you know, when you first become -- OK, you know you start with these DUIs and stuff --

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Howard Stern: But, you know, being a DA, then suddenly a prosecutor, you start to take on gangs.

Kamala Harris: Yes.

Howard Stern: You've written that you had to face a guy who scalped his girlfriend.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Howard Stern: Scalped his girlfriend

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Howard Stern: Gang guys.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Howard Stern: Did you fear for your life? Did you ever -- did your mother even say to you, "What are you doing? You went to law school." What -- it's a scary profession, right? It's no nonsense.

Kamala Harris: I mean, I've always been clear-eyed about what's involved. And, yeah, there is -- there -- there are threats and all of that, but the good that you can do standing in front of a jury and saying to that jury that this mother's child should not have been killed --

Howard Stern: Yeah

Kamala Harris: To say that this person who is engaged in human trafficking should pay a consequence, to say that, you know, that -- that people should receive dignity and -- and that there has to be serious consequence for serious crime, I just -- I think that's some of the most important work that anyone can do, which is to require that we have a society that does not allow, in particular, for -- for violence and that kind of behavior to go without consequence, serious consequence.

Howard Stern: It's really weird, too, because to me, you're the law and order candidate. And yet, they try to paint you like you're some leftist, I don't know, who wants to have people running through the streets, committing crimes. You were a prosecutor.

Kamala Harris: I have put a lot of people in jail. I have personally prosecuted everything from, you know, child sexual assault to homicides; and then, as attorney general, transnational criminal organizations, which I took on as a leader.

Howard Stern: But -- but talk -- you know, the story that got me was this 6-year-old girl when you were a prosecutor.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Howard Stern: It was a 6-year-old girl who you felt would not be able to recount to the jury the abuse that was going on in her home.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Howard Stern: And you had to walk away. You had to say to yourself, "Oh, God, I can't put this kid through it. She won't win the case." And knowing she's going to go home to this father or wherever was -- stepfather --

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Howard Stern: Who was abusing her, that kind of work, you take it home. I mean it has to eat at your soul.

Kamala Harris: It does.

Howard Stern: Because you probably went home that night and that little girl is in the house with her abuser.

Kamala Harris: It was one of the most difficult cases I've ever handled. I, to this day, remember exactly when I realized that that was what was going to happen. To this day, I remember where I was. I remember exactly how I felt, and I still -- I still think about that and her. You know, as a prosecutor, I spent -- I would go up to the -- the parents of homicide victims, would have a meeting every Thursday evening.

Kamala Harris: And no DA had gone up there. And I would go up and join them for their meetings

Howard Stern: Wow.

Kamala Harris: And talk with them about -- and basically figure out what we needed to do more to figure out who the killer of their child was and to be able to then bring those cases to justice. It's -- I think it's very important that we all agree that, look, as a society, there has to be a serious consequence for the one person killing another human being --

Howard Stern: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: A woman being raped, a child being molested, there has to be serious consequence. And that's the work I've always done for the majority of my career, and I feel very strongly about it. And I think that people should be able to live in a society where they feel safe. I think of safety as a civil right.

Howard Stern: Right.

Kamala Harris: And all people have the right to be safe because think about a society that doesn't have that, where then people are constantly worried about something unexpected happening to them. That's not going to be a productive society.

Howard Stern: So, when you went after gang members, I'm talking about people who traffic, who traffic drugs --

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Howard Stern: And this and that kind of thing. Were you ever directly threatened by these people? They said, "Hey, you better just shut this down or you're -- or you're going to get it?"

Kamala Harris: I've definitely had death threats.

Howard Stern: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: Yeah. I don't generally talk about them, but --

Howard Stern: Right.

Kamala Harris: Yes.

Howard Stern: Why don't you talk about them? Because you don't want to encourage any kind of nuts out there, or is it because it just is too -- it's just too hard to confront?

Kamala Harris: I refuse to live in fear of -- of -- of the bad guys.

Howard Stern: Yeah. Well, it's very brave.

Kamala Harris: I just -- I'm not going to -- I'm not doing that. I'm not doing that.

Howard Stern: Does it infuriate you, too, that -- first of all, it's something drives me nuts, with Obama's presidency, he had the opportunity to appoint someone to the Supreme Court. Mitch McConnell goes, "F you. You're not appointing anyone to the Supreme Court," basically. You're the sitting president of the United States.

Howard Stern: The basic unfairness of that makes me insane. It makes me feel like America's going down the tubes. How can this be? The president could not appoint a Supreme Court justice. And now, we have a Supreme Court, you know what, you want -- you want to get an abortion, you don't want to get abortion, I trust any woman to make that decision for herself.

Howard Stern: What is this? I don't want Donald Trump and his party deciding. I don't want Clarence Thomas deciding.

Kamala Harris: But here's the thing that is, again, really important that people understand about who Donald Trump is. He hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court to do exactly what they did, take away the right of an individual to make decisions about their own body. Like, I asked people to take a step back.

Kamala Harris: Let's -- let's just think about it this way. Let's -- whatever your gender --

Howard Stern: Right.

Kamala Harris: And it's not about abortion. You have basically now a system that says you as an individual do not have the right to make a decision about your own body. The government has the right to make that decision for you. So, regardless of how you feel about abortion, think about what that means. You know, the -- the -- the strength of America includes that we have been committed, as Americans, as part of our spirit to the expansion of rights.

Howard Stern: Right.

Kamala Harris: And for the first time, we're seeing a restriction of rights, fundamental rights, including what could be more fundamental than to make decisions about your own body. And that's what has happened. And, Howard, to your point, look, this is not this -- this issue is not about trying to convert people. Right?

Howard Stern: Right.

Kamala Harris: Because one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree --

Howard Stern: Right.

Kamala Harris: What the government shouldn't be telling her what to do with her body. She will talk with her priest, her pastor, her rabbi, her imam, but not the government about what to do.

Howard Stern: Well, here's what I worry about. You got a guy who says probably you don't really need to vote if I win. You got a guy who says, "Hey, we're not stopping here." You know, gay rights are next.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Howard Stern: You know it. You know it.

Kamala Harris: But Clarence Thomas said it.

Howard Stern: Yup. I mean, who doesn't have -- you know, here's the crazy thing to me -- who doesn't have gay people in their life? Whether it's your kid, whether it's your best friend, whether it's -- I mean, the genie is out of the bottle, guys.

Kamala Harris: And to your point, think about it. You know, so I actually was proud to perform some of the first same-sex marriages as an elected official in 2004, OK?

Howard Stern: Right.

Kamala Harris: A lot of people have evolved since then, but I did back in 2004. Here's how I think about it. We actually had laws that were treating people based on their sexual orientation differently. So, if you're a gay couple, you can't get married. We were basically saying that you are a second-class citizen under the law, not entitled to the same rights as a couple who are consenting adults in a loving relationship.

Kamala Harris: You, therefore, when one of you is sick when one, God forbid, passes away, will not have the same legal rights.

Howard Stern: Right.

Kamala Harris: We were saying, literally, you're a second-class citizen under the law. And now, you see the court that Donald Trump created --

Howard Stern: That is insanity.

Kamala Harris: Openly talking about what else could be at risk. And understand, if Donald Trump were to get another term, most of the legal scholars think that there's going to be maybe even two more seats that will be up. That means, think about it, not for the next four years, for the next 40 years, for the next four generations of your family, what might be a Supreme Court that is about restricting your rights versus expanding your rights.

Howard Stern: What do you think, too, of these judges basically saying whatever Trump does in office is OK, including assassinating his opponents because he's doing it for the good of the country? What the hell is going on here? You're the prosecutor, you're the attorney general, what -- what is going on here? Is this America?

Kamala Harris: So, to your point, that's where everyone, I think, is starting to understand. This election is not 2016 or 2020 because that Supreme Court decision just a few months ago basically said to the former president, you will be immune from anything you do in office. Now, this is a guy who has said --

Howard Stern: That's insane.

Kamala Harris: He'll be a dictator on day one.

Howard Stern: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: Has said he would weaponize the Department of Justice, take away the independence of the Department of Justice, and put his loyalists in; somebody who has said -- literally, he would use this word. He uses this word. He would terminate the Constitution of the United States. You know what the Constitution of the United States does? That's the Fourth Amendment against unreasonable search and seizure.

Kamala Harris: That's the Fifth Amendment, which is your right to remain silent. That's the Sixth Amendment, your right to an attorney. And he's going to terminate the Constitution?

Howard Stern: Yeah. Let me ask you this, if he wins, God forbid, would you feel safe in this country? Would you stay in this country?

Kamala Harris: Howard, I'm doing everything I can to make sure he does not win.

Howard Stern: But what if he does? How can you be safe? He's saying, "Oh, I'm just going to do whatever the hell I want. This time, I know what I need to do."

Kamala Harris: You know what? All of those former officials from the national security, the over 200 Republicans, who worked with both Presidents Bush, Mitt Romney, John McCain, who are endorsing me; the former Vice President Dick Cheney, who was voting for me along with his daughter, Liz Cheney --

Howard Stern: Liz Cheney.

Kamala Harris: We are building a coalition of people that are Republicans, independents, Democrats libertarians, all stripes of Americans who are coming together to say, you know what, this election is about putting country before party; that this is about saying, do we want a President who's going to abide by the oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States, or someone who is full time engaged in flattery from Vladimir Putin of Russia and sending Covid testing kits over to him when Americans are dying every day.

Howard Stern: It's -- it's remarkable. By the way, you have said something I've been screaming about for years. I believe the United States Postal -- I believe you can tell a society by its post office.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Howard Stern: You go overseas, you can't get a letter. The post office here in the United States is so fantastic. We don't -- we take things for granted. Right now, we're taking for granted how good things are.

Kamala Harris: You're right.

Howard Stern: We really are. And you have said -- and I was thinking back to when Trump was president, remember who he appointed to be in charge of the post office --

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Howard Stern: And remember the chaos at the post office?

Kamala Harris: Yes.

Howard Stern: I couldn't get a letter.

Kamala Harris: Yes.

Howard Stern: That's enough.

Kamala Harris: Yes.

Howard Stern: I don't know. I don't know. I just -- I don't get it.

Kamala Harris: But here's the thing, let's not throw up our hands, let's roll up our sleeves --

Howard Stern: We shouldn't have to.

Kamala Harris: because this -- but this is our country. And you know what? If you love our country, we got to fight for our country. We can't take our country for granted. I love our country, I love the American people. And what I see when I'm traveling all over our country is that people are coming together of all different backgrounds based on a common belief that if you love something, you got to fight for it.

Kamala Harris: And -- and that's what this moment -- that's this moment.

Howard Stern: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: And we are -- we can have our disagreements, but there's some foundational stuff that we got to agree on. And it includes rule of law. Free and fair elections should not be overturned just because you didn't like the outcome because you lost.

Howard Stern: Now, let's talk about that for a second.

Kamala Harris: OK.

Howard Stern: How crazy -- how do you vote for someone who says, "If I win, it was a fair election. If I lose, Kamala Harris and her buddies fixed it." That's delusional. That -- you can't have that. And you can certainly not storm the Capitol when you're the sitting president of the United States.

Kamala Harris: In America, we call that a sore loser. And in this case this is someone who has already lost, which would say that they are actually already a loser.

Howard Stern: And how do you vote for someone who says, "Find me 11,000 votes." What is that? It's on tape.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Howard Stern: I mean, it's so crazy. The -- when you ran for Senate, it was bittersweet, right? You won --

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Howard Stern: Which is great. But you said I ate a whole bag of Doritos that night. That's your thing, Doritos?

Kamala Harris: Oh, I love Doritos, original nacho. But let me just tell you, it was a family-sized bag.

Howard Stern: Wow.

Kamala Harris: I sat on the couch --

Howard Stern: But you're in good shape. Were you like --

Kamala Harris: I work out every morning.

Howard Stern: Did you work out this morning?

Kamala Harris: I did.

Howard Stern: Where did you work out?

Kamala Harris: On the elliptical at the hotel.

Howard Stern: They bring one up to your room?

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Howard Stern: Nice. How long do you go on the elliptical?

Kamala Harris: Half an hour to 45 minutes.

Howard Stern: You're not bored out of your skull on that thing?

Kamala Harris: I'm watching a variety of things. That's how I catch --

Howard Stern: Morning Joe?

Kamala Harris: Yeah, sometimes. Yeah,

Howard Stern: He's something, "Morning Joe." I love that guy.

Kamala Harris: I do, too. Joe Scarborough, yeah.

Howard Stern: A former Republican.

Kamala Harris: Yes.

Howard Stern: He can't vote in his own party.

Kamala Harris: But he loves our country.

Howard Stern: He does.

Kamala Harris: I don't agree with him on every issue, but we agree on the -- I think the most important at this moment for sure.

Howard Stern: Why are you eating for breakfast raisin bran, I read? Why raisin bran? There's a lot of sugar.

Kamala Harris: Well, no, so I don't eat raisin bran every morning.

Howard Stern: OK.

Kamala Harris: But if you ask me what was my favorite cereal, I would put it right up there with -- OK. And then, this is going to be obnoxious and Special K.

Howard Stern: Special K, it's --

Kamala Harris: Well, it's really great, plus my mother used to make these Special K cookies in honor of me.

Howard Stern: Can you imagine if your mother was alive --

Kamala Harris: Yeah. I miss her everyday.

Howard Stern: And saw her daughter running for President of the United States.

Kamala Harris: I miss her every day.

Howard Stern: She was something, huh?

Kamala Harris: Yeah, she was very special, all five feet of her. You would have loved her. If you met her, you would have thought she was 6-feet tall.

Howard Stern: When she worked in a chemical lab, and she worked on developing cures for breast cancer --

Kamala Harris: Correct.

Howard Stern: You would go with her as a little girl --

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Howard Stern: And clean the test tubes.

Kamala Harris: That was my first job, and I was awful. She fired me.

Howard Stern: She fired -- because why? You were like things have to be --

Kamala Harris: Because I didn't want to do it. I didn't want to do it. I didn't want to clean pipettes, you know.

Howard Stern: Was it -- was it a weird time in your life? I think a couple of defining moments would be not only going to law school, but even going back in time. Here, you're living in Oakland.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Howard Stern: And they decide to bust the Black kids to the white school. And they put you on a bus and bus you there. Was --

Kamala Harris: It was actually the flatlands of Berkeley at the time. But, yeah, they did.

Howard Stern: But did you see -- did you see -- were kids openly hostile to you? Because I imagine --

Kamala Harris: When we arrived at school?

Howard Stern: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: I didn't have that experience, in large -- you know, let me tell you, maybe this is one of the reasons why. My first grade teacher, Mrs. Frances Wilson, God rest her soul, attended my law school graduation. Yeah.

Howard Stern: Wow. Wow.

Kamala Harris: Yes.

Howard Stern: You mean you actually had relationships with your teachers? Oh, that's so healthy.

Kamala Harris: Yes, I had relations -- yes. And it was --

Howard Stern: How did you know to do that? How did you know --

Kamala Harris: Well, no, it's what she did. And that's what I'm saying so that -- you know, it was like -- I love teachers, I really do. They do God's work, think about it.

Howard Stern: They sure do.

Kamala Harris: We don't pay them nearly enough.

Howard Stern: No.

Kamala Harris: And what is their calling? To teach other people's children. Right? So, when you ask me what was that like, what was the environment like, I think it was all of those incredible teachers who -- they set an example and they created an environment that was welcoming and nurturing. And, you know, I mean I'm very blessed to have been raised and -- and people I talked to who have achieved any level of success.

Kamala Harris: One of the things that I've found to be a theme is that, at some point, we were each told be it by a teacher or somebody at your church or synagogue, or a parent, but we were told, at some point, that we were special. And by the way, we were not particularly special. But somebody told us that and we believed them.

Howard Stern: Right, otherwise, you'd be a wreck.

Kamala Harris: Right. Right. And -- and that's part of, you know, that's -- I had the blessing of, you know, in my childhood, especially in those really critical stages of development to have a teacher like Mrs. Wilson and in an environment that really told all the kids you can be and do anything.

Howard Stern: Do you -- I'm wondering about this. With all this pressure on you right now, and you've got to win, you know, you just have to --

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Howard Stern: I really believe it's -- we're in for the darkest --

Kamala Harris: I know.

Howard Stern: Skies on the planet, like the sun's literally going to go out. I -- this is how I feel. And -- and God bless you for doing this because I'm really afraid that people -- good people, bright people are discouraged from going into public service now. They're like --

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Howard Stern: I don't need it, I don't want to be threatened. I don't want to be told that, you know, I'm for science and I'm an idiot. You know -- you know, it's -- the whole thing is crazy. With all the pressure on you, is there -- like, you can't go to a therapist, can you, and say, "Hey, I want to -- I want to unload a little bit."

Kamala Harris: This is my form of therapy right now.

Howard Stern: With me? But -- but seriously --

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Howard Stern: Because there's still that one taboo in politics. If you go to a therapist, you're weak and you're probably insane. And to me, going to a therapist means you're sane, like you're trying to work on yourself. I only wish Donald would go.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Howard Stern: You know, he -- I don't know how easily you'd cure that narcissism at this point.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Howard Stern: But -- but can you -- could you go and talk to someone like a therapist and get therapy?

Kamala Harris: Well, let me just tell you. I have -- I have the great fortune of having a really incredible group of friends. My best friend from kindergarten is still one of my best friends.

Howard Stern: Really?

Kamala Harris: Yeah. I have an incredible husband. And so, I do have people in my life that I can talk to. And one of the things I -- I advise others is, you know, especially younger people, I mentor a lot of people, men and women --

Howard Stern: What do you mean by that? When you mentor someone like a young kid comes to you and says, "Gee, I'm thinking of going to law school, or. "I'm lost," or --

Kamala Harris: Yeah. Well, just people I'll meet along the way who will express to me some goal or some desire they have, and I'll just make sure that I follow up with them. And one of the things I say and I believe is that we each should -- we should be conscious of the fact that there are certain choices we can make.

Kamala Harris: And one of them is about who we choose to be in our life in our inner circle. And so, choose to have people in your life in that inner circle who are supportive of you and who will encourage you, you know people who, when you trip will laugh with you when you trip, but then pick you back up and push you back out.

Howard Stern: Why do we attract so many people who aren't like that? And why are we attracted to them? I do that all the time. I go, "What am I doing with this person?"

Kamala Harris: You have to be conscious of it. You have to be conscious of it. You know, to be very rudimentary, like choose not to have mean people in your life.

Howard Stern: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: You know, just --

Howard Stern: It seems like the country is so angry right now.

Kamala Harris: Well, I think that we just -- we should remember the good. And I don't mean to sound naive, but we have to remember the good we have so many hardworking, good people who I have the great experience of meeting every day. I'm -- for example, one of my passions is small businesses.

Howard Stern: Right.

Kamala Harris: So, my mother worked full time. She worked long hours, and we lived on a nursery school above a child care center. And the woman who owned that, Mrs. Shelton, was our -- we called her our second mother. She helped my mother raise us. She was a small business owner. I grew up as a child knowing small business owners.

Kamala Harris: They are leaders in the community. They hire locally. They mentor. So, I have a real passion for small businesses. Wherever I go around the country, I try to visit small businesses. I'm telling you, Howard, around our country, all these people who are innovative, ambitious, they are optimistic, they are building, they are creating, they are obviously contributing to our economy like we have, this is the spirit of the American people.

Howard Stern: And things are good.

Kamala Harris: And we are ambitious, and we are aspirational.

Howard Stern: I mean, you guys introduced that infrastructure bill.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Howard Stern: And I mean, there are people building. You know, the economy is -- is doing very well.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Howard Stern: Yeah, you're right. It could -- prices in every presidential election have been way too high. There's never been an election where we said prices are too low.

Kamala Harris: Well, we need to work on bringing prices down. I mean, part of my point is we need to go after price gouging.

Howard Stern: Right.

Kamala Harris: I've done that before. You know, we got to go after the bad actors where they exist, especially during emergencies. I mean, these -- these storms and these hurricanes. I've seen it with wildfires in California, where, you know, when people are desperate in an emergency, some bad actors will jack up prices.

Kamala Harris: We need to go after them and, you know, stop them from taking advantage of desperate people.

Howard Stern: Yeah. There was a guy selling, the other day, $100,000 watches from --

Kamala Harris: Yeah, it's --

Howard Stern: From China [inaudible]

Kamala Harris: Well, they're going to -- you know, in moments of crisis, the predators will come out --

Howard Stern: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: And you got to go after them.

Howard Stern: To -- speaking of your husband --

Kamala Harris: Yes.

Howard Stern: Was it hard for you -- because you were so successful at an early age, you know, being a prosecutor, the DA, attorney general, all -- all of these jobs, was it hard for you to make a love connection, to make a romance with Doug? Because I would think most men would be intimidated by you.

Kamala Harris: My husband, Doug, is one of the strongest, most self-actualized people, men I've known.

Howard Stern: You loved him right away, or was it a slow build?

Kamala Harris: I did. I did. Doug, so let me tell you about Doug. Doug grew up in Jersey.

Howard Stern: Oh.

Kamala Harris: He worked for everything he had. He -- we have a picture of him when he was employee of the month at McDonald's.

Howard Stern: And you were at McDonald's?

Kamala Harris: I worked at McDonald's.

Howard Stern: By the way, you can't leave here because I have questions about McDonald's.

Kamala Harris: OK, I'll answer anything you have, but so -- but he worked for everything he has. And he has the best sense of humor. He's -- he's very -- I don't want to say simple, but he's -- he's really clear. He cares about family, he cares about working hard. He --

Howard Stern: Was he a lawyer?

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Howard Stern: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: He was a lawyer. He started his own law firm.

Howard Stern: Is that how you met? Because he -- like, how did you meet him?

Kamala Harris: So, we met on a blind date, my best friend set us up. That's how we met. And it turned out that we have friends in common that we separately knew, and then it all connected.

Howard Stern: Have you ever set anybody up on a blind date? I think it's the most dangerous thing you could do, maybe even more dangerous --

Kamala Harris: You know, there's -- it's kind of like roulette, right? Like, it might hit, it may not. And -- but look, I think that as people -- you know, I mean, I'm on the campaign trail, I'm at various things. And people will come up to me. I know you met your husband on a blind date. You got anybody for me?

Howard Stern: Well, you know, what he described was he was very nervous around you. You left a rambling voicemail.

Kamala Harris: Yes, he did.

Howard Stern: And he was sure that you thought he was a douche and that you were never going to see him again. And yet, you -- you hooked up. That was it.

Kamala Harris: He is -- I feel very fortunate to have a husband who is so -- he's just secure in his skin. He's not trying to be anything he's not. And, you know, he's an incredible father to the kids. He's just -- he's an incredible son to my in-laws.

Howard Stern: Right.

Kamala Harris: He's just good people.

Howard Stern: Do you think there are people who will not vote for a woman because she's a woman? I mean, I think -- I think you're up against that, which just you know my best associations in radio and in business have been collaborating with women.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Howard Stern: Going back to when I made my movie, I had a female director. And when I worked at the E Network, I had this woman, Fran Shea, who was so fabulous. And there's an energy. And I believe that women -- I've said this on the air a million times, women have to work harder to get respect. So, they actually go -- like in show business, they actually have to go to film school and then intern and then work their way up to become a director.

Howard Stern: Guys can bullshit their way through it and get away with a lot. And I don't understand this philosophy, especially guys who have daughters and sisters and mothers. What is the bias? I mean what -- what -- what is it? They think a woman is going to be weak in the White House? Is that -- I mean, I don't know how you combat that, honestly. I don't know what you say to those people.

Kamala Harris: Listen, I've been the first and -- first woman in almost every position I've had.

Howard Stern: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: So, I believe that men and women support women in leadership, and that's been my life experience, and that's why I'm running for president.

Howard Stern: When you made that call -- well, first of all, when you got the call from Joe Biden --

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Howard Stern: That said "I want you to run with me as your vice president," were you floored? Were you expecting it?

Kamala Harris: I didn't know that I was going to get it. And I -- you know, I obviously had put myself out as as being open to it --

Howard Stern: Right.

Kamala Harris: And I was incredibly honored when he reached out to me and offered it to me.

Howard Stern: This guy, Tim Walz, I don't know how you -- I -- I'm really -- maybe one day you'll write about this, like picking a vice president.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Howard Stern: I mean, here you are running for president.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Howard Stern: And, you know, in an unusual circumstance with Joe Biden just said, "OK, I hear you," which, by the way, what a -- I mean, I had him on my show.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Howard Stern: What a loving man.

Kamala Harris: Yeah, he's such a good person.

Howard Stern: He said "for the good of my country." That must have been the hardest thing in the world for him. He had the nomination.

Kamala Harris: History is going to show it was probably one of the most -- one of the rarest moments of any president to do with courage, with the deepest level of courage and love of country.

Howard Stern: Where were you when -- when he -- you know, when he called you up and said, "Look, this is my decision, and I think I'm going to endorse you." And where are you at that point?

Kamala Harris: I'm at home. It's a Sunday afternoon in my workout clothes. My niece, her husband, and their two daughters were staying with us. And I made pancakes that morning. They were asking for extra bacon. I was getting it for them.

Howard Stern: You love to cook.

Kamala Harris: I love to cook.

Howard Stern: Right.

Kamala Harris: And then, we had this puzzle we were working on. And so, we went to go work on the puzzle.

Howard Stern: Jigsaw puzzle.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Howard Stern: You're into that, huh?

Kamala Harris: Oh, yeah, I love puzzle, especially with kids. It's so fun. So, we were working on the puzzle, and the phone rings. And it's Joe. And -- and so, I got up to take the call, and -- and then life changed.

Howard Stern: Wow.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Howard Stern: What a call. How long did you talk?

Kamala Harris: We talked a couple of times that day. And that morning, I'd say probably for like half an hour. You know, and I mean the first thing I asked him, to be honest with you, is, "Are you sure?" Yeah.

Howard Stern: I felt bad for him because you know why? He did a damn good job.

Kamala Harris: Yeah, he did.

Howard Stern: He took over a chaos.

Kamala Harris: And he's still doing a great job.

Howard Stern: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: He's not done. He's not done.

Howard Stern: I know. I know. A terrific guy. And this Tim Walz, I think he's fantastic. When you were at the Democratic convention, he gets up with this energy.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Howard Stern: Who tells you to -- I guess, it's a whole think tank, right, when you're -- did Obama advise you on your pick for vice president?

Kamala Harris: No. I made the decision. I made the decision. But --

Howard Stern: How often did you meet with him to -- before you decide?

Kamala Harris: Well, I had worked with him because, you know, he's also president of the -- of the Governors Association. So, we had been working together. And -- and then, I, obviously, met with him to talk with him about considering him for -- for my running mate. And let me just start with saying that there were a lot of incredible candidates.

Kamala Harris: And ultimately, my decision really was just my gut decision because none of the candidates lack for an incredible level of talent and experience. But the thing about Tim Walz is, you know, people would look at the two of us and think "What could they possibly have in common?" He grew up on one side of the country in a rural environment.

Kamala Harris: I grew up on another side of the country in a very urban environment. You know, we just look different. We look like we'd be very different.

Howard Stern: Right.

Kamala Harris: We have so much in common.

Howard Stern: Because he's a public servant.

Kamala Harris: But also, here's the thing, Howard.

Howard Stern: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: He reminds me of the people I grew up with, different part of the country, maybe a different race, but hard working people, straight-talking, grounded in principles.

Howard Stern: Great governor.

Kamala Harris: Yeah, but just good people.

Howard Stern: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: Right. Like, good, solid, hardworking people. And I -- and I just -- that was very attractive to me about him.

Howard Stern: When Trump was president, I would lay awake at night worrying about the presidency. And I would see people in his cabinet leaving and coming and going. It was like mass chaos. People were like resigning every minute. I believe if you become president, I think you just said, too, you're going to put a Republican in your -- in your cabinet.

Kamala Harris: Yes. Right. Yeah.

Howard Stern: I love that. That's old school.

Kamala Harris: Look, listen, I know and I've been a decision-maker long enough to know that the best decisions I make are when I bring in a variety of perspectives that allow me to consider every angle and to -- to build consensus. That's the best way, as a leader, I believe, you make good decisions.

Howard Stern: And, yeah, I think so, too. And I -- and I think as -- you know, the more I think about the people that you're going to have in your cabinet and all this kind of thing, I'm guessing it's going to be Liz Cheney who you appoint, am I correct?

Kamala Harris: I got to win, Howard. I got to win.

Howard Stern: You got to win.

Kamala Harris: I got to win.

Howard Stern: You got to win.

Kamala Harris: And listen, but the thing about Liz Cheney, let me just say, she's remarkable. She's smart. She is a dedicated public servant. She has shown extraordinary courage --

Howard Stern: Absolutely.

Kamala Harris: In this moment where there's such violent divisive language that she would put herself out so publicly and say, "I'm country before party." And, you know, she and I don't agree on everything.

Howard Stern: No.

Kamala Harris: But the fundamentals, we do agree on.

Howard Stern: But she's saying, "My one big issue is I believe in democracy and the people's right to vote."

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Howard Stern: So, that's it. That's the decision. And she said, "I don't care about particular issues right now."

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Howard Stern: I need a country that's free, and I need -- this is the United States of America. If this -- if the lights go out here, it's going to be a darkness all over the world. NATO, no NATO --

Kamala Harris: But to your point, I've now met, as vice president, over 150 world leaders, presidents, prime ministers, chancellors, and kings. And part of what keeps me up at night is the knowledge, based on experience, America is so important to the rest of the world, Howard.

Howard Stern: Yeah, absolutely.

Kamala Harris: We are so important to the rest of the world.

Howard Stern: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: We are a role model for what it means to be a democracy. So, we can look at other countries and our allies and our adversaries and say these are the principles that must be upheld. And while we uphold these principles, we will also be the strongest economy in the world. We will have the most lethal fighting force in the world.

Kamala Harris: All these things co-exist, but you've got to have a president who appreciates and understands that. On the issue of the military, we already discussed where Donald Trump is. He belittles the members of our military.

Howard Stern: And who's more important than our military? I mean --

Kamala Harris: But -- right. You look at the economy. My plans for the economy, listen, I am a capitalist. I'm also a -- I am also a devout public servant that knows government can't do everything by itself.

Howard Stern: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: My econ policies, Goldman Sachs to 16 Nobel laureates will tell you that my plans will strengthen our economy. Donald Trump's plans would weaken our economy, would inflate inflation, and would bring a recession on by the middle of next year.

Howard Stern: What are these guys up to with mispronouncing your name? They act as if they can't say Kamala.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Howard Stern: It's not that complicated.

Kamala Harris: It's --

Howard Stern: What's going on? What -- what really is going on there when they can't pronounce Kamala? Is it supposed to be an insult? Is it like Barack Hussein? Is it some sort of slur?

Kamala Harris: It's the same old tired playbook, Howard. And I think most people are not going to be distracted by it. They want to know you have a plan for bringing prices down.

Howard Stern: Right.

Kamala Harris: They want to know you have a plan for keeping America secure.

Howard Stern: Right, right. So -- so I would sum up your plan, the -- I love the $6,000 tax credit for those with newborns.

Kamala Harris: Yeah. Yeah.

Howard Stern: And this is a real boon to people. This is stuff that would be -- you know, I'm a -- I'm a new grandfather --

Kamala Harris: Oh, I didn't know that.

Howard Stern: I have two grandchildren, but I have --

Kamala Harris: A new one?

Howard Stern: A new one, brand new.

Kamala Harris: Good for you. Congratulations.

Howard Stern: And you know what, a $6,000 tax credit is saying you're pro-family.

Kamala Harris: And -- and what does it do? It allows a young -- young parents to be able to buy a crib, a car seat. That stuff is expensive, the stuff that is so --

Howard Stern: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: Necessary for that incredibly important phase of their child's development. And again, the return on the investment is profound.

Howard Stern: Yes.

Kamala Harris: Pro-family is about taking care of -- like I announced today, my plan to make sure that Medicare covers at-home elder care, because, probably, a lot of your listeners are in that sandwich generation.

Howard Stern: Oh, my God.

Kamala Harris: Where they're taking care of young kids and their elder parents.

Howard Stern: My mother's 97-years-old. I'm -- I'm not even going to tell you how old I am. I know you think I'm 30, but I am so old. And I have an old mother, 97-years-old. The cost is -- people don't know this yet. If they're not taking care of somebody elderly, it will bankrupt you.

Kamala Harris: Absolutely.

Howard Stern: It will will --

Kamala Harris: Or your parent will not get the care they need. Or you're going to have to leave your job --

Howard Stern: Right.

Kamala Harris: Which means you're going to reduce your income to, depending on what it is, almost nothing in terms of your household income to do what you want to do, which is to give your parent the dignity they deserve with care.

Howard Stern: And can you imagine if Medicare is impacted or Obamacare, for that matter. And people think --

Kamala Harris: And look at what Donald Trump has been talking about for years. And look at his Project 2025, people should google it. I mean, what they're doing and what he's talking about in terms of attacking Social Security, Medicare, undoing the Affordable Care Act, and which means the insurance companies can come back and deny people with preexisting conditions, all of this is very real and very much at stake in this election.

Howard Stern: Yeah, I mean, I really do -- I hear what you're saying. And you know what even was weird to me, and I'll end on a high note here -- or low note. So, Taylor Swift endorsed you. Great. OK. I don't know if it moves the needle or not, but you need everyone to come into the tent and be part of the party. To say "I hate Taylor Swift" because she disagrees with your politics, he's done this to me.

Howard Stern: When Donald asked me to introduce him at the Republican convention, I said, "Donald, I can't, I'm voting for Hillary Clinton," he was very upset with me and he said, "No, no, no, no, no." And -- and then he hated me. You know, then I was a bad guy, no longer had ratings, I wasn't funny. I was -- you know, I got all the -- all the -- all the crap for it.

Howard Stern: How can -- how can we have that kind of mentality? You mean because she disagrees with his politics, he hates her?

Kamala Harris: So, I think Donald Trump is an unserious man, and the consequences of him being president again are brutally serious.

Howard Stern: Yeah, they really are. Bruce Springsteen, did you watch his endorsement of you? It's fantastic.

Kamala Harris: I did. I was very touched, I was very touched. I'm a huge fan, and -- and obviously, Doug is a huge fan from Jersey.

Howard Stern: So, when you were in college, this -- I'll end on this, I have to understand this. So, you're working for Senator Cranston.

Kamala Harris: Yes.

Howard Stern: I remember Senator Alan Cranston.

Kamala Harris: You do? Yeah. Yeah.

Howard Stern: Yeah, sure.

Kamala Harris: He was an early -- he was one of the early environmentalists.

Howard Stern: Yeah. Do you remember Allard Lowenstein, too, and all those and maybe you don't --

Kamala Harris: Yeah, no, yeah.

Howard Stern: You're younger than I am. But anyway -- but you're working at a senator's office and you're working at McDonald's at the same time?

Kamala Harris: Well, I worked at McDonald's the year before.

Howard Stern: Oh, you did.

Kamala Harris: The summer before.

Howard Stern: Oh, OK. I thought -- because I was like, well, that is a real -- like you go to work during the day for Cranston, and then you're at McDonald's. Was McDonald's fun at all, or is it really hard work? Is it just a drag?

Kamala Harris: You know, I mean, I -- it was -- it's an experience, right? I mean, I was doing the fries, and you got to watch the timer, and it's -- it's hard work. But honestly, Howard, I will say in all seriousness, the point about McDonald's for me is also -- you know, I was a college kid, and I was spending money. Right?

Howard Stern: Right.

Kamala Harris: There were people who were working there, that was the source of their family's income.

Howard Stern: That's right. Yeah.

Kamala Harris: Right? And -- and that's the thing that I think -- that's my takeaway about that experience as much as anything, which is we still got a lot of work to do to make sure that folks cannot just get by but get ahead. And that's why I'm so committed on what I call an opportunity economy.

Howard Stern: I think you'd be a great president. I think you're compassionate. I think you've had all the life experience. I love your experience as a prosecutor. And -- and I want to thank you because I know I'm getting the high sign. I want to thank you for all the years of public service.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Howard Stern: I appreciate anyone who really serves the public and serves them in a -- in a way. And I know even as a prosecutor, you got people out of jail who were falsely accused.

Kamala Harris: Oh, yeah.

Howard Stern: And that to me says something.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Howard Stern: And I love you as vice president of the United States. And I just want to encourage anyone who thinks similarly to me to vote. And if you don't agree with me, do not vote. I encourage people not to vote who are thinking in a direction of endorsing Vladimir Putin and all that stuff. I hope people get out and vote.

Howard Stern: I hope we wake up and just end this nightmare. And -- and go to iwillvote.com and register to vote for Kamala Harris. And I'm very -- my mother is beside herself that you're here with me today.

Kamala Harris: What's her name?

Howard Stern: Ray.

Kamala Harris: Ray. Hi, Ray.

Howard Stern: My son, my son, my son is going to interview the vice president of the United States.

Kamala Harris: Hi, Ray.

Howard Stern: Yeah. I said, "Mom, just calm down." She's on so much morphine, she won't even remember I did this, but she'll be all right. Listen, this is fantastic. Thanks for coming in.

Kamala Harris: Thank you.

Howard Stern: I wish you the best.

Kamala Harris: Anytime.

Howard Stern: I know there's a lot of pressure on you. I hope this was fun for you, and I'm sure you're exhausted from the --

Kamala Harris: I'm honored. I'm honored to be on your show, Howard Stern.

Howard Stern: How did the -- how did "The View" go? Was that fun?

Kamala Harris: It went well, it went well.

Howard Stern: Whoopi behaved?

Kamala Harris: Whoopi behaved. And there was some -- you know, we had covered some serious topics, some fun topics. So, there was --

Howard Stern: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: There were two kids in the audience who, during the break, confessed that they were playing hooky.

Howard Stern: Wow.

Kamala Harris: And so, I wrote them basically hall passes.

Howard Stern: That's great stuff.

Kamala Harris: There you go.

Howard Stern: Well, listen, thanks for doing this.

Kamala Harris: Thank you.

Howard Stern: And -- and thank you for everything.

Kamala Harris: I appreciate you. Thank you for the time.

Howard Stern: It's very cool for you to be here.

Kamala Harris: Thank you for the time.

Howard Stern: Kamala Harris, vice president of the United States, who actually went to see U2 at the Sphere.

Kamala Harris: Yes.

Howard Stern: Was that any good, by the way?

Kamala Harris: Oh, my God. Have you been to the Sphere?

Howard Stern: I'm -- I'm troubled by it. I --

Kamala Harris: Well -- well, let me just say, basically, everyone should go in with a clear head.

Howard Stern: Isn't it too much?

Kamala Harris: But that's why I'm saying that.

Howard Stern: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: Like, definitely go in and --

Howard Stern: You mean, don't be high?

Kamala Harris: Correct.

Howard Stern: Right. Like --

Kamala Harris: Because it's a lot. Like, there's a lot of visual stimulation.

Howard Stern: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: And then, I love U2. It actually -- it was a -- it was a surprise for Doug. Because we have been working and working and working. And he and I both -- this is the other one we have in common is U2. And so, as my surprise, he thought we were leaving Nevada from campaigning and heading back to DC. And then, we drove up the street to the Sphere.

Howard Stern: Wow.

Kamala Harris: And the band actually came and said hello. But it's -- it's extraordinary. You sit in there, and it's almost like Disneyland or Disney World where things just start to change around you.

Howard Stern: Wow.

Kamala Harris: And you feel -- like you lose a sense of gravity because of the -- it's really phenomenal --

Howard Stern: Wow.

Kamala Harris: Which is also what's interesting about it then is -- is, to your point about mics and all this stuff, you don't really need a lot of stage props because the props are all in the Sphere on the -- on the monitors.

Howard Stern: Right.

Kamala Harris: You got to go see it. It's really --

Howard Stern: Really?

Kamala Harris: It's really fantastic. It's an incredible work of -- of just technology. Yeah.

Howard Stern: And you collect vinyl?

Kamala Harris: Yeah, I used to --

Howard Stern: We have to talk about this. I know that you have to go but --

Kamala Harris: Yeah. And then -- but I collect it for our son, Cole, too, because he's now hip to everything. And so, when I try to -- so my small business tour, so I try to go wherever I am also if there's a record store.

Howard Stern: Right.

Kamala Harris: And then, I'll pick up vinyl for him and bring it back for him.

Howard Stern: Wow. That's a -- that's just -- and just answer this quickly.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Howard Stern: Why do you like Formula 1? These guys drive around the cars over and over again in a circle?

Kamala Harris: Oh, so good.

Howard Stern: You really love that?

Kamala Harris: We love it. Our whole family does.

Howard Stern: It's not a campaign thing?

Kamala Harris: And depending on -- no, God, no. No. Well, actually, I haven't been able to watch it a lot recently because I am campaigning because, you know, also depending on where they're driving, the time of day, you know, you got to wake up --

Howard Stern: Who's your favorite driver?

Kamala Harris: Lewis Hamilton, of course.

Howard Stern: I don't even know who that is.

Kamala Harris: He's leaving Mercedes. You don't know -- you don't watch Formula 1? No?

Howard Stern: I mean --

Kamala Harris: Oh, it's you -- once you start, I think -- you should see it, you might get hooked.

Howard Stern: Wow.

Kamala Harris: It's good stuff.

Howard Stern: You don't play golf, do you?

Kamala Harris: No. Doug does. I don't.

Howard Stern: Good. Good. I don't want any golfer near the White House. Too much golf. I say if you get the opportunity to be president of the United States, they run off to -- what is that? That secret hideaway that Eisenhower built. What's it called?

Kamala Harris: I don't know because it's secret. What is it, Howard? I don't know.

Howard Stern: You know what I'm talking about, Camp David.

Kamala Harris: Oh, yeah, Camp David. Well, historic site. By the way, you know --

Howard Stern: You go there?

Kamala Harris: Donald Trump invited the Taliban there, so --

Howard Stern: Yeah, wow.

Kamala Harris: Let's put that -- let's put that on that ledger.

Howard Stern: My father said, if the Americans ever saw Camp David, there would be a revolt in the country, that it's --

Kamala Harris: I've never been.

Howard Stern: You've never been.

Kamala Harris: No.

Howard Stern: God bless you.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Howard Stern: You should be president. If you never go to Camp David, that would be amazing. It really is. OK.

Kamala Harris: OK.

Howard Stern: I'm being told you have to go.

Kamala Harris: OK.

Howard Stern: I love this conversation. Thank you so much.

Kamala Harris: I hope to come back. Thank you so much.

Howard Stern: Absolutely. Anytime.

Kamala Harris: OK. Thank you.

Howard Stern: All right.
