Brené Brown: Vice President Kamala Harris --

Kamala Harris: It is so good to be with you --

Brené Brown: Welcome to "Unlocking Us." Thank you.

Kamala Harris: Dr. Brown. It is so good to be with you. Thank you.

Brené Brown: I'm just thrilled and ready to dig in.

Kamala Harris: Me, too.

Brené Brown: OK. We're going to start where we start all of these.

Kamala Harris: OK.

Brené Brown: Tell us your story and start from the very beginning.

Kamala Harris: Oh, Lord. How much time do you have?

Brené Brown: Well, we don't have it -- we -- you know, five, 10 minutes.

Kamala Harris: OK.

Brené Brown: I mean, this is an important part because I -- I've heard bits and pieces, but I want to -- I -- I'm going to ask hard questions along the way.

Kamala Harris: OK. OK. So, I am one of two daughters who -- we were raised primarily by my mother. My parents divorced when I was five, and I'm the eldest. And my mother had two goals in her life: to raise her two daughters and to end breast cancer. She was a breast cancer researcher and one of the very few women and certainly one of the very few women of color.

Brené Brown: Wow.

Kamala Harris: And a lot of my work on women's health was formed, you know, when -- as I was growing up, listening to her and watching her passion about the need for women to have dignity in the health care system. We grew up in an incredible neighborhood where the kids, we would ride our bikes, just all of us together, you know, because the -- the way we were all raised was just go out and play.

Brené Brown: Go. Just go -- the -- the bike gang. Like --

Kamala Harris: Right. Get out of the house. Right? And we did have the bike gang.

Brené Brown: Yeah, you got it. Oh, yeah, no, I had the banana seat.

Kamala Harris: Yes, I had my banana seat. Seriously, right?

Brené Brown: Oh, yeah.

Kamala Harris: And then -- and then the tassels and -- right?

Brené Brown: Oh, yeah.

Kamala Harris: Oh, we were very serious about this.

Brené Brown: Yeah. And you knew where everyone was because there'd be 30 of those bikes in someone's front yard.

Kamala Harris: But that's exactly -- and wherever you ended up around dinnertime is where you ate.

Brené Brown: That's it.

Kamala Harris: Right?

Brené Brown: Our house, too. Oh, yeah.

Kamala Harris: Right? And so, I had the blessing of a really great childhood because it was -- like, it was a working-class neighborhood of -- you know, I try to explain to people, have you ever known a neighborhood where people are -- they're proud of their lawn?

Brené Brown: Oh, yeah.

Kamala Harris: You know what I mean?

Brené Brown: Oh, yeah.

Kamala Harris: Out there trimming their roses, out there mowing their lawn, and just pride in neighborhood, pride in community. It was the kids of the community. We were raised where -- I -- I talk about this, which is that I had and have an incredible family, and it is the family that I have that is by blood and it is the family that I have by love.

Kamala Harris: And that's how I was raised, that you create your family as much as you are born into your family, right?

Brené Brown: Right.

Kamala Harris: And so, I grew up with, you know, this expectation also -- I joke about it. We were raised in a community of people that told all of us as kids that we were special. We weren't particularly special, but they told us we were, and we believed them, right?

Brené Brown: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: And I think that, in parenting, there are certain things that we do for the children in our lives, that teachers do so beautifully, that we can all do that is just about inspiring a kid to believe that they are loved and they are special and then you create a high standard for them and they know they're supposed to rise to it, you know.

Brené Brown: Oh, God, yeah. I mean, I see you.

Kamala Harris: Right?

Brené Brown: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: Right?

Brené Brown: And I -- I see you and I know what you're capable of, and it's --

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Brené Brown: Tremendous.

Kamala Harris: And that's it.

Brené Brown: That's it.

Kamala Harris: And that's it.

Brené Brown: That's it.

Kamala Harris: And then when you do that -- you know how kids are, especially, you know, like 12 and under, and you tell them that and they just start walking around with their chest out --

Brené Brown: Oh, yeah.

Kamala Harris: And their chin up. And that's one of the best things you can give a child. And then you let them explore, and you -- and you tell them they are special, which also means that we expect a lot of them.

Brené Brown: So, this -- so I'm going to pause you here --

Kamala Harris: OK.

Brené Brown: Because this is -- if you look at the parenting research, this follow-up piece is key, which is not you're special and you don't have to work at anything, not you're special and you don't have to do anything.

Kamala Harris: No.

Brené Brown: You're special.

Kamala Harris: And therefore --

Brené Brown: Therefore.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Brené Brown: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: I mean, I was part of -- and I am like this with our kids and with -- you know I have baby nieces who I just love to pieces. They're my niece's children. And when you turn into, like, your 20s and then you look at your parents and you're like these are all the things you did wrong.

Brené Brown: Oh, yeah.

Kamala Harris: Right? And I remember saying to my mother, "You never took my side," because if I came home with any problem and talked to my mother about it, the first thing she would do was not "Oh, honey, come here. Let me hug you. Oh, honey, let me take care of it." The first thing she would do is look at you and say, "Well, what did you do?"

Brené Brown: What's your part?

Kamala Harris: And what stuff --

Brené Brown: She was Leadership 101.

Kamala Harris: But that's right because what I realized later is that she was teaching me and us that -- reflect on what your agency was at that moment and what was your responsibility; and to the extent that you can control it, don't let things happen to you.

Brené Brown: OK. I have to pause you again here because this is my nerdy research thing.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Brené Brown: Hope.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Brené Brown: You know, people think hope is a gauzy emotion of possibility. Hope is actually mostly taught by parents and a learned cognitive behavioral process. What's interesting about it is the positive correlation between hopefulness and a sense of agency.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Brené Brown: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: I see -- as you say that, I see that.

Brené Brown: Yeah. So, hope is actually three. This is CR Snyder's work out of Kansas. Hope is goal. I can set a goal.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Brené Brown: Pathway.

Kamala Harris: Right.

Brené Brown: I can find a path to it --

Kamala Harris: Right.

Brené Brown: That includes plan B, C, D, and E if plan A doesn't work.

Kamala Harris: Right. Right.

Brené Brown: And agency. I believe in my ability to do it.

Kamala Harris: Right. But the hope is the driver.

Brené Brown: The hope is the driver.

Kamala Harris: Exactly.

Brené Brown: But this pause that your mom made --

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Brené Brown: About let's talk about your agency here.

Kamala Harris: In a way that also requires you to -- I think it's very important to also -- in any situation; and certainly, it's a rule for today among those who call themselves leaders -- to then think about it in the context of reflection because it also requires reflection.

Brené Brown: Say more.

Kamala Harris: What happened? What could have happened? What role did I play in what happened?

Brené Brown: Oh, yeah.

Kamala Harris: And what role did I play? It could be something where you should critically analyze it or to know that that is -- that there is a lesson learned, right? And I think that's important.

Brené Brown: It's courageous. I mean, it's -- it's a hallmark of courageous leadership. It's a hallmark of our leadership work is that your ability, anytime you're giving corrective feedback or coaching, to anticipate you're going to have a part.

Kamala Harris: Right? But that's exactly right. And that's right because, you know, as a -- as a leader, I'm very hard on myself, and one of the things that I feel and take very seriously is my responsibility to be prepared. Also, I've got this little thing about it's really important to me to be on time. In fact, someone teased me recently who's worked with a lot of elected leaders, and, like, I've never seen an elected leader who's always on time.

Kamala Harris: But I feel that I owe other people the respect of knowing their time is important.

Brené Brown: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: Right? And the very least I can do is respect that in terms of what they've had to do in their day to meet with me, what they've had to put aside to do that. But there are these things that are about just what is your role in a moment of responsibility and -- and also duty. You know, I gave a speech years ago about the distinction that I see between duty and charity, right?

Brené Brown: I'm making a face. You all can't see it, but I'm making a face.

Kamala Harris: Right?

Brené Brown: Yes.

Kamala Harris: And there's a big difference.

Brené Brown: There's a huge difference.

Kamala Harris: Right? Charity kind of is -- I mean, I'm oversimplifying it obviously, but charity is, well, I have a little extra to give and I will be benevolent and I will give you some of what I have. Duty is the responsibility that you have. It's not an option.

Brené Brown: No.

Kamala Harris: It is a responsibility. You should not expect to be applauded for it because it is actually what you are supposed to do. And I -- I connect that to something I've seen my whole life and then most recently when I visited the aftermath of Hurricane Helene and I went to a lot of the relief centers. And you've probably seen this.

Brené Brown: Oh, yeah, Houstonian.

Kamala Harris: Right. And what you've probably seen there and I've seen throughout my life, it is often the case that the people who have the least to give --

Brené Brown: Yes.

Kamala Harris: Give the most.

Brené Brown: Yes, 100 percent of the time.

Kamala Harris: Right?

Brené Brown: I mean, we actually see that in the research on charitable giving.

Kamala Harris: Right? It's incredible. It's incredible. And that's what I mean about duty. It's not if you have. It's I have -- I have two pennies, I give you one, right?

Brené Brown: Yeah. I mean, it makes me -- it just makes me emotional as somebody who's lived through a lot of -- you know, you know we're Houstonians. We've -- we've seen it all go away.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Brené Brown: It takes me back to Harvey.

Kamala Harris: Wow. Wow.

Brené Brown: When the people getting us out of our home were part of the Cajun Navy. They were fishermen.

Kamala Harris: Right?

Brené Brown: Yeah. That --

Kamala Harris: Right.

Brené Brown: Came here in their F-150s, pulling their boats, you know, gator fan boats, all kinds of stuff, with all kinds of interesting accouterments on them.

Kamala Harris: Yeah, of course.

Brené Brown: But they were -- they were putting us in those boats.

Kamala Harris: Right.

Brené Brown: And so, it is --

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Brené Brown: I have to ask you a question.

Kamala Harris: Sure. Anything.

Brené Brown: And you can just say I'm wrong.

Kamala Harris: No, anything.

Brené Brown: I'm -- I'm sensing some serious firstborn energy here.

Kamala Harris: Oh, for sure.

Brené Brown: That's a firstborn. I'm like I see you. I see you.

Kamala Harris: You know, I was just talking with my team about this today. I -- I try not to harp on it, but there is certainly something to birth order.

Brené Brown: There is. I mean, the research is so muddy, but every researcher who studies it goes, you know, we don't know, but it's true.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Brené Brown: You know, it's just -- it's just --

Kamala Harris: Right?

Brené Brown: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: Well, like I grew up, from the age of two, being told look after your sister.

Brené Brown: Yeah. I mean, I tell a story about I'm the oldest of four, and -- and, you know, sometimes, my therapist will say like this really -- like this really inflated sense of importance. And I was like when you grow up hearing put the toilet lid down or your, you know, sisters will die --

Kamala Harris: Right.

Brené Brown: You -- you get a pretty big sense of like, wow, every decision I make has pretty big consequences.

Kamala Harris: It has --

Brené Brown: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: Absolutely right.

Brené Brown: OK. I've got to ask you this question. You get to Howard.

Kamala Harris: Uh-huh.

Brené Brown: I heard it was a Houstonian that termed -- that created the term -- is it -- is it C-Cubed or three C?

Kamala Harris: So, C-Cubed was my -- C-Cubed was the name that I was given by my sorority when I joined the sorority.

Brené Brown: OK.

Kamala Harris: We all had our nicknames.

Brené Brown: OK.

Kamala Harris: And that was mine, and it stands for cool, calm, and collected. So, yes, that was a very long time ago and that was the name I was given. Yes.

Brené Brown: I had to track it back because I actually started the research on the short haircut.

Kamala Harris: Yeah. Oh, you did?

Brené Brown: Yeah, because someone sent it to me in this moment of excitement about you running and said, "She had to have listened to Depeche Mode. Look at the haircut. We're going hard." And I was like OK, wait.

Kamala Harris: So, let me just tell you, my husband loves Depeche Mode, and I am not -- it's not my thing. It's just -- so that's funny you say that, but I did have that short cut, but that was like those days. It was those days.

Brené Brown: I had a short cut, too, '86.

Kamala Harris: But you know what, you're right, it was -- well, so the -- the person who kind of managed our sorority when I joined was a Houstonian. So, yes.

Brené Brown: I love this story.

Kamala Harris: Yes, yes.

Brené Brown: OK. First time you fell in love.

Kamala Harris: Oh, goodness. In high school.

Brené Brown: Did you?

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Brené Brown: Did you get your heart broken or did you break someone's heart?

Kamala Harris: I don't -- I didn't get my heart broken. I kind of just -- I went to college. You know, but there's also -- I mean, like my best friend from kindergarten is still one of my best friends.

Brené Brown: Oh, you're kidding.

Kamala Harris: No. In fact, she's been out campaigning for me in North Carolina, knocking on doors.

Brené Brown: Let's go.

Kamala Harris: Right? I love my girlfriends. Like, I -- we have a sisterhood, like I have my sister and, in addition, my chosen sisters who we have traveled life together, right? I am godmother to their children. Our husbands are like brothers, right? And it's a big part of my life. It's a big part of my life. And it's a big part of probably my sanity.

Brené Brown: Oh, for sure.

Kamala Harris: Right?

Brené Brown: Yes.

Kamala Harris: You know.

Brené Brown: Yes.

Kamala Harris: And in fact, I tell women -- I mentor a lot of women and men, and I say this to -- to the youngest, though, including our kids, including younger, you know, adults. Know that -- again, this gets back to agency. Know you have a choice to decide who will be in your friend circle and choose those people who are going to root for you, those people who are not going to judge you but, at the same time, are going to say, "Girl, you need a mint."

Brené Brown: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Kamala Harris: Those who will laugh with you when you trip and fall and then they'll pull you back up and push you out. And -- and sometimes, I just simplify it this way because I did that a long time ago in my life. I'm not going to have mean friends.

Brené Brown: No.

Kamala Harris: But you have to be -- you have to be intentional about these things, right?

Brené Brown: You do, especially if you ever experience -- I mean, one of the things that we do with our kids is we do this little metaphor where we have them put a little -- like pretend like there's a flame in their hand and say when you get really bright and shine, make sure you don't hang out with anyone that comes by and blows it out because your light is too bright.

Kamala Harris: Oh, that's beautiful. I like that.

Brené Brown: You know, just like --

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Brené Brown: You want someone that says, "Hey, man, you're shining."

Kamala Harris: Right.

Brené Brown: Let me help you block the wind for a minute.

Kamala Harris: Right. And that's right. And -- and we have to teach -- and including other adults.

Brené Brown: Yes.

Kamala Harris: You -- actually, you have the right to not have mean people in your life and to sit back and actually be intentional about how do people make you feel. And it doesn't mean that people are just blowing smoke.

Brené Brown: That feels bad, too, actually.

Kamala Harris: Right. And it does. And it --

Brené Brown: Yes, people feel bad, too.

Kamala Harris: And it absolutely does.

Brené Brown: Right.

Kamala Harris: And it will not take you to a good place.

Brené Brown: No.

Kamala Harris: Right?

Brené Brown: And there's no trust in that.

Kamala Harris: No, but there's not. And there's no safety in that either, right?

Brené Brown: Yeah. It's really interesting. I saw a quote the other day that said how someone treats you says more about you than them, how you allow them to treat you says more about you.

Kamala Harris: That's great.

Brené Brown: Yeah, and I think that's true, and I think that's adult friendships. Like you said, it's walking a very difficult path.

Kamala Harris: Right. But you have to be intentional about it.

Brené Brown: You have to be intentional.

Kamala Harris: This is not like a television program where it's just going to happen because you just end up being someone's roommate.

Brené Brown: Right.

Kamala Harris: Right?

Brené Brown: No, it's work.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Brené Brown: Relationships.

Kamala Harris: It is -- and it is work. And friendships are work. And it's work that's good work. It's work that can be joyful work.

Brené Brown: And it can be hard.

Kamala Harris: Yeah, it can be hard, but --

Brené Brown: Sisterhood is the same way, don't you think?

Kamala Harris: But it is.

Brené Brown: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: Of course.

Brené Brown: Yeah. I mean, I've had some of the most -- Ashley and Barrett are two of the most important people in my life.

Kamala Harris: You have two sisters.

Brené Brown: I have two, they're identical twins.

Kamala Harris: Oh, wow.

Brené Brown: Oh, yeah, when my parents brought them home in New Orleans, I was like holy crap, are both of them staying? Like, this is a -- this is a --

Kamala Harris: How old were you when they were born?

Brené Brown: Eight, and my brother is between us. And so --

Kamala Harris: Oh, wow.

Brené Brown: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: OK. OK.

Brené Brown: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: And so, you're close to your brother.

Brené Brown: Yeah, codename Sister Superior, yeah.

Kamala Harris: Oh, my God.

Brené Brown: But that's OK.

Kamala Harris: That's great.

Brené Brown: I got --

Kamala Harris: All three of them call you Sister Superior?

Brené Brown: Only on occasion and only once.

Kamala Harris: Yeah. And usually, around like a Thanksgiving dinner.

Brené Brown: Yes. Yeah. Yes. Yeah, we just did a podcast, the one before this is with my sisters about my mom's death and kind of --

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Brené Brown: There was a funny moment where I said, "Well, no, I just wanted it to go this way." And I said, "What did you want, Ashley?" And Ashley said, "I just wanted you to stop telling me what to do mostly." I was like but that's my job.

Kamala Harris: Well, you and I have had that experience of our mother's passing.

Brené Brown: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: And what that -- and during an illness, what that does, right? Because it's interesting, the relationship between adult siblings in the context of your parents can have the effect of having you revert to your 12-year-old self.

Brené Brown: Oh, my God. I mean, all of a sudden, right.

Kamala Harris: Right?

Brené Brown: Like "Scooby Doo" is on.

Kamala Harris: Right. Like you could --

Brené Brown: It's -- it's -- yeah.

Kamala Harris: You could lead the world --

Brené Brown: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: But you are just back to being 12.

Brené Brown: Yes. No, in a heartbeat.

Kamala Harris: Yup. Yeah, it's not pretty.

Brené Brown: They push the buttons because they installed them.

Kamala Harris: Exactly. That's good.

Brené Brown: Yeah. So --

Kamala Harris: Oh, you've got -- I just feel like I should be writing notes right now.

Brené Brown: Yeah, yeah, no, I -- I read a lot -- I read a lot of quotes. OK. I'm going to transition to leadership --

Kamala Harris: OK.

Brené Brown: Because I have a question for you.

Kamala Harris: Sure.

Brené Brown: So, we've been studying like courageous leadership, daring leadership for 15 years.

Kamala Harris: Yeah, yeah.

Brené Brown: We have found that daring leaders often have one or two values that are core to them. And we all have a lot of values, but one or two that are core where every other value is forged. What would you say as a leader that your primary one or two values? How would you identify them?

Kamala Harris: Yeah, they're probably directly connected, fairness and justice.

Brené Brown: No, I would have never. That's so powerful.

Kamala Harris: That's really, really important to me. I --

Brené Brown: Fairness and justice.

Kamala Harris: Yeah. I mean, I have -- I mean, I -- it is -- it prompts me to act if I -- if I see something that is unjust or unfair, and at the same time, fighting for that -- for others is something that is a real motivator of mine and actually will, you know, cause me to have a very almost emotional feeling --

Brené Brown: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: About the importance of it.

Brené Brown: Fairness and justice. OK. Another leadership question. I've been watching you. You're making a funny face.

Kamala Harris: Yikes. OK.

Brené Brown: No. And it's interesting, I see in you -- there's a generational difference in leadership.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Brené Brown: So, folks who are 10, 15, 20 years older than us come from a brand of leadership that is very command and control.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Brené Brown: It's somewhat ego-protective. And our generation is kind of caught in between that and highly collaborative.

Kamala Harris: Right.

Brené Brown: Highly coalition-building.

Kamala Harris: Absolutely. Yeah.

Brené Brown: And in the best moments, surrounding ourselves by experts who are high performers, have deep knowledge and understanding and great strategy skills.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Brené Brown: You seem to move toward coalition and collaborative leadership. Is that a fair assessment?

Kamala Harris: Very much. Very much.

Brené Brown: Say more. Say more.

Kamala Harris: I -- my lived experience is to know that the vast majority of us have more in common than what separates us. And -- OK. So -- so, you know, Gen Z and others will kind of -- they've got this whole meme about me and my, dare I say, obsession with Venn diagrams. I love Venn diagrams.

Brené Brown: Ain't nobody over 40 that didn't like a Venn diagram, y'all.

Kamala Harris: Right.

Brené Brown: Just get used to it.

Kamala Harris: I love --

Brené Brown: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Kamala Harris: I love Venn diagram.

Brené Brown: We love a Venn. We love a Venn.

Kamala Harris: Like, are you -- if you're faced with conflict, pull out a Venn diagram.

Brené Brown: And the map pencils to color it.

Kamala Harris: Right?

Brené Brown: Yes. Yeah.

Kamala Harris: I'm telling you. In fact, you know, when my goddaughter went to college, she's now a sophomore, and she comes and stays with me from time to time because we're both on the East Coast right now, and it was -- her -- one of her first weekends in her freshman year. And she's like," Auntie I've got --" And it's all these different groups and she's trying.

Kamala Harris: And I was like, "Honey, we're going to pull out the Venn diagram." That Venn diagram had about 11 circles on it.

Brené Brown: Perfect. I mean, that's it.

Kamala Harris: And I was like, "OK, we're going to figure out where is the intersection, and then let's figure out where you're going to fit into it." I literally still have this Venn diagram. But I -- I just think that if we work toward coalition-building, we are stronger as a society. I just know it. And I know that when you bring together seemingly different people and you bring people around a table, you can watch -- and it's so exciting. You watch how the silos break down.

Brené Brown: Oh, yeah.

Kamala Harris: And everyone leaves a bit taller, you know.

Brené Brown: For sure. Seen, heard, valued, contributed.

Kamala Harris: Yeah. And -- and, you know, part of the struggle that I think we have increasingly in the society as it is evolving and, in some ways, devolving, people are feeling alone. And when you feel alone, it's very disempowering. And when we can bring people together and they see the commonality, it is then empowering of the individual, as well as what it does for the collective.

Brené Brown: That's right.

Kamala Harris: Right?

Brené Brown: That's right.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Brené Brown: I mean, that's -- that's actually the secret sauce of high-performing teams, and it doesn't matter whether I'm working with a corporate team, an NGO team, a military special, that -- that is --

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Brené Brown: You're not alone.

Kamala Harris: Right.

Brené Brown: And we are more alike than we're different.

Kamala Harris: Right.

Brené Brown: I -- I have to say something now because I'm getting -- I'm trying to win the over-under and not cussing during the podcast, but --

Kamala Harris: Go for it.

Brené Brown: OK.

Kamala Harris: Just go for it.

Brené Brown: No, no. I have -- I have to say this. What you're describing is very different than what I saw from the previous Trump administration and certainly a stark difference in what he's committing to do in the next four years if he's president. And I want to talk about something really specific, and -- and this is very difficult for me just as a woman, as a person, but also as someone who has studied leadership for decades.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Brené Brown: He's talking about loyalists, not experts, in positions of authority. People that will serve him, not our country, including, most recently, a comment about using the military against Americans who disagree with him.

Kamala Harris: The enemy within. He talks about the enemy within. American citizens.

Brené Brown: I -- I have to catch my breath for a second. I -- I have to understand -- or I want to understand. I don't have to understand, but I want to understand. If I were working in an organization, a Fortune 100 company, and I saw a leader surrounding himself or herself with loyalists who serve a person rather than a mission and a purpose and shareholders or a board --

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Brené Brown: That would last five seconds.

Kamala Harris: Right, right, right.

Brené Brown: Do you think this fear about putting loyalists in place is a -- is a real fear?

Kamala Harris: It is a very real fear. And we have heard, look, the people who know Donald Trump best, who worked with him, members of his political party who worked with him inside the Oval Office, inside the Situation Room, who were his chief of staff. Most recently, the one who spoke out --

Brené Brown: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: A four-star Marine general, his national security adviser, two secretaries of defense, and his former vice president have all said he is unfit to serve as president and he is dangerous. Donald Trump is someone who has said he would terminate the Constitution of the United States. I have taken the oath to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States six times: twice as DA, twice as attorney general, as a United States senator, and now as vice president.

Kamala Harris: There are very few oaths. You know, one that you -- that you make to your spouse, to God, but -- but to the Constitution of the United States is the highest duty, the most sacred duty that any office holder, especially president of the United States. And this man says he would terminate the Constitution of the United States.

Kamala Harris: And talking about enemies within, I mean, that harkens back to like McCarthyism.

Brené Brown: No. Yeah, I mean, it's like a straight line. It's a short line.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Brené Brown: It's a short walk.

Kamala Harris: Yeah. And -- and so, the fear is real and legitimate and very well founded. But what I urge everyone to do is do something with that fear, which is understand that we, as long as we hold on to it, have a democracy. And in a democracy in our country, the people have the power through their vote to determine who will be their leaders and who will be president of the United States.

Kamala Harris: And the direction of our country right now, we are truly at an inflection point. We are truly at an inflection point.

Brené Brown: I believe that.

Kamala Harris: And --

Brené Brown: And I see it. And, you know, I just did a two-part special with Heather Cox Richardson.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Brené Brown: The great.

Kamala Harris: She's so wonderful.

Brené Brown: Yeah, the historian.

Kamala Harris: Historian, yeah.

Brené Brown: And she, among many historians, right now, are just reminding voters that authoritarian rule does not come into power with 1950s grainy black-and-white movies of tanks rolling in or guns being held to people's heads in almost -- I mean, if you look at Hungary, if you look at --

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Brené Brown: I mean, like what's happening is we vote someone in --

Kamala Harris: Yup.

Brené Brown: And so, this -- yeah, the enemy within. [Begin audiotape]

Brené Brown: Can I run something by you?

Kamala Harris: Anything.

Brené Brown: It's -- it's a theory that I have about what's -- what I see going on, and I see it from a different perspective than probably political because I study human behavior and emotion.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Brené Brown: I actually get the attraction of the Trump-Vance approach, and I'm going to tell you why I get it. I get it because we are not neurobiologically hardwired for uncertainty. Antonio Damasio is a neuroscientist. He -- he always said, "Don't ever believe that we're thinking machines who have feelings. We are feeling machines who, on occasion, think." And so --

Kamala Harris: Which is the key to the survival of the species.

Brené Brown: Right, which is the key to the survival of the species. And so, what ends up happening, I think, with this kind of what we were seeing with Trump and Vance, especially, is it is really good reality television. It is kind of what we would call in the social sciences emotional pornography, that the country is somewhat numb to a base level of emotion, I think because we've been through so much in the last few years, that it takes extraordinary emotion to get our attention, and the bigger and the blustery, the emotion.

Brené Brown: And what ends up happening is a strategy of emotional -- just kind of emotional nuttiness. And "We're going to win and we're going to do this," and everybody's, like, "Yes." And then you -- I find you standing in front of not fans with hats on that match your campaign, but undecided voters talking about the Middle East and Ukraine and economic policy.

Kamala Harris: Yeah. Yeah.

Brené Brown: And that is -- I mean, really, I hate this metaphor, but I am a fifth-generation Texan. My grandpa would say, "Damn, girl. You brought -- you brought a -- you brought a knife to a gunfight."

Kamala Harris: Right.

Brené Brown: Like you're talking -- you're talking policy. You're talking -- you're actually talking about --

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Brené Brown: What's going to -- in my opinion, I -- and I'm not being overwrought here, you're talking about the things that I believe could keep my children alive.

Kamala Harris: Yeah, that's my intention.

Brené Brown: Especially my daughter.

Kamala Harris: That's my intention.

Brené Brown: So, you're talking about how it's going to work.

Kamala Harris: And I'm going to tell you something. We are going to win. It is not going to be easy. We are going to win. I believe that the majority of Americans not only love our country deeply --

Brené Brown: I believe that.

Kamala Harris: Right. But understand that at the end of the day, the true measure of the strength of a leader is not based on who you beat down, it's based on who you lift up. It's what we teach our kids. It's what we want in leaders in terms of how they look at us and think about us. And, you know, I talk about it on the campaign trail because I truly believe people are exhausted with the Trump era.

Kamala Harris: They're done. That no matter what the differences between us, we know that it is not healthy and it does not strengthen us as a nation to have Americans pointing their fingers at each other.

Brené Brown: No.

Kamala Harris: Right?

Brené Brown: I mean, it's -- it's -- not only is it exhausting, it is --

Kamala Harris: It's debilitating.

Brené Brown: It's debilitating, and it's somewhat traumatizing --

Kamala Harris: Right.

Brené Brown: To track that level of emotionality in rhetoric, especially -- there -- in the study of power, we talk about power over versus power with and power to. And in the type of leadership you're taught --

Kamala Harris: I think about that in freedom, freedom from, freedom to.

Brené Brown: Yes. Yes, exactly. And so, the leadership you're talking about is power with and to.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Brené Brown: The problem with power over -- there's a lot of problems with it. But the biggest -- the biggest thing I've seen over the past 20 years in my career is to maintain power over, you have to be willing to exercise occasional cruelty --

Kamala Harris: Right.

Brené Brown: Against vulnerable populations. Otherwise, you don't lose that fear that power over depends on. And, you know --

Kamala Harris: But the cruelty --

Brené Brown: Yeah, the cruelty.

Kamala Harris: Is a key part of what you were talking about.

Brené Brown: And that's traumatizing for us.

Kamala Harris: Yes, it is. And it is -- it is demeaning, but it is also -- it's traumatizing. And what we know --

Brené Brown: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: And you know, you're the expert at this table, trauma, it numbs the individual.

Brené Brown: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: It numbs the people. And when we are numb, we will not achieve our capacity, not to mention, we will not achieve not only our capacity in terms of productivity but in terms of a quality of life. I mean, I -- I think about it, and I think it is an important thing to think about, you know, what -- what brings you joy. I think that's important.

Brené Brown: Oh, my God, it's key.

Kamala Harris: Right? And think of it this way. If you've ever tried to talk with someone who's depressed and you try to literally and figuratively open the curtains and say, "Look, it's -- the sun's out. It's a beautiful day," and they can't see it. And there is something about trauma that is very similar in terms of it blunts our senses and ability to see the good, the things that will bring joy.

Kamala Harris: It's not healthy. And so, we have to, to your point, diagnose it, and we have to treat it. And one of the ways to treat it ultimately is not only to deal with the symptoms but deal with the cause.

Brené Brown: Cause. Yeah.

Kamala Harris: And that's what I'm trying to do.

Brené Brown: You know, I want to talk to you about this because I think this is interesting. One of the emotional pulls that my friends -- I've talked to a lot of people preparing for the interview. Some -- you know, because that's what I do, but, like, just the research. And some undecided, some voting for you but thinking should I mobilize and just, like, really get after it and fight? And I'm like --

Kamala Harris: Yes.

Brené Brown: Yes, we should. Yes.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Brené Brown: I want to talk about the emotional pornography that's being used and the false narratives. So, part of the narrative that's really being used, I think, by some extremists and not all -- because let me tell you, I have an awkward family table at Thanksgiving. Like, I got people --

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Brené Brown: All -- I mean, again --

Kamala Harris: Right.

Brené Brown: This comes with the territory of the fifth-generation Texan, right?

Kamala Harris: Right. Right.

Brené Brown: I -- I don't know how to say out loud. When you think you're the party or the people who own toughness, God, patriotism, responsible gun ownership, and family, then anyone who disagrees with you is not patriotic --

Kamala Harris: That's interesting.

Brené Brown: Hates God, is weak and not tough. And what is crazy about that is not true.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Brené Brown: So, can I take them one by one with you?

Kamala Harris: Of course. Of course. Of course.

Brené Brown: OK. There was a moment at the Democratic National Convention when I -- I saw this still photo of you, and below you were people holding signs that say we fight and we win. And I was like this is one of the first people in my party to acknowledge that we have to fight to win.

Kamala Harris: Yup. Oh, yeah.

Brené Brown: You're not afraid --

Kamala Harris: Nope.

Brené Brown: Of owning the fact that, sometimes, winning takes fighting.

Kamala Harris: Absolutely. And here's how I think about that. If you know what you stand for, then you know what to fight for. It's not fighting for the sake of fighting.

Brené Brown: Say that again.

Kamala Harris: If you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for. I stand for the freedom of women to make decisions about their own body. I stand for the fact that we should treat each other with dignity and respect. I stand for the proposition that we need to lift up working people and give them access to opportunity.

Kamala Harris: These are the kinds of things I stand for, so I fight for them.

Brené Brown: And if you look at the history, I think, of our party, the expansion of liberty and justice, the protection of people, and the values we hold dear --

Kamala Harris: Of course.

Brené Brown: You know, we are tough as nails.

Kamala Harris: Right.

Brené Brown: So, I love the fact that you're unapologetic. If you say that -- if you know what you stand for --

Kamala Harris: You know what to fight for.

Brené Brown: You know what to fight for. And I -- the second image, and this is -- this gets kind of complicated, but this is in my jam right here. This was seeing how much the Walz children adore their dad.

Kamala Harris: I know. Yeah.

Brené Brown: And it was beautiful. And I thought for a moment, Carl Jung said that paradox, this ability to hold seemingly contradictory things --

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Brené Brown: Is the most important spiritual gift we have and the closest thing that captures the truth to being human. And when I saw you fight to win and I saw the Walz family, what I thought is these are not different things.

Kamala Harris: No.

Brené Brown: These are born of the courage to love and the courage to lead.

Kamala Harris: You're absolutely right, and you hit it on the head because it is not only if you know what to stand for, you know what to fight for. If you love, you know what to fight for.

Brené Brown: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: And I know this is going to sound corny, but I love our country.

Brené Brown: You really do.

Kamala Harris: I do.

Brené Brown: I can tell.

Kamala Harris: I do. And I -- I believe in the promise of America. I am empirical evidence of the promise of America. I know what we can do. I know what we -- I believe in the foundational principles, and maybe that's being trained as a lawyer and one of the reasons I wanted to become a lawyer. I believe that we can make true all of those words we spoke about our commitment to equality, to liberty, to justice.

Kamala Harris: I believe in all that. But none of it will come without us being vigilant. No, it won't. You know, on democracy, look, I think there's a duality to its nature.

Brené Brown: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: Right? On the one hand, strength. When a democracy is intact, what it does to protect the rights and the freedoms and the liberties of its people. Incredible strength.

Brené Brown: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: On the other hand, incredibly fragile.

Brené Brown: Oh, there's a fragility.

Kamala Harris: It will only be as strong as our willingness to fight for it. I guess that's your point also about the duality in terms of the paradox.

Brené Brown: It's a duality -- the paradox. Yeah, that's a paradox.

Kamala Harris: Yeah, that's -- yeah, that's right. Yeah.

Brené Brown: I want to say something else about in this kind of, like, fake narratives that are just not true and emotionally resonant for people but untrue. No party gets God. Like, I love God. I mean, I taught Vacation Bible School. There is no long-term evaluation of how those kids are doing or whether they're, you know, all still OK.

Brené Brown: But, like, I love God. And if you measure your faith and your commitment to the sacred --

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Brené Brown: Not by proclamation --

Kamala Harris: I'm with you so -- I'm with -- I'm so with you.

Brené Brown: But by the willingness to protect --

Kamala Harris: By deed. And deed.

Brené Brown: The most vulnerable among us.

Kamala Harris: Faith in your works.

Brené Brown: Faith -- oh, my God, I was just going to say that.

Kamala Harris: Right?

Brené Brown: Faith without action.

Kamala Harris: No.

Brené Brown: Like -- so I don't care how much you say you love God.

Kamala Harris: I'm -- I'm so with you. And I have never -- I have, as an elected person, purposely not talked a lot because I just find that the people who do tend to be hypocrites.

Brené Brown: Oh, yeah.

Kamala Harris: And, you know, I was raised -- I was raised in a Black church. I was raised to believe in a loving God. And the God that I believe in and pray to is a God that says do justice, have mercy.

Brené Brown: Do good.

Kamala Harris: It is about do good. It is about feed the hungry. It is about care for the poor and the elderly. It is about love thy neighbor. It is about the Good Samaritan who, in the face -- I mean, that's one of my favorites, the parable of the Good Samaritan, which is -- you know, my way of talking about it is that we should in the face of a stranger see a neighbor, right?

Brené Brown: Beautiful. Yeah.

Kamala Harris: Right? And that -- getting back to what I saw in terms of the relief centers after Hurricane Helene.

Brené Brown: That's it.

Kamala Harris: That is doing the work of --

Brené Brown: Of faith.

Kamala Harris: Of living your faith.

Brené Brown: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: I like to say faith is a verb.

Brené Brown: For sure.

Kamala Harris: Right?

Brené Brown: I mean --

Kamala Harris: Because it is about -- it is about knowing something even when you can't see it, but it is also about then manifesting it, right, and -- and then making it real. And so then, that's when you see faith and you have faith, right, when you see it in the works and the deeds as an expression of your deeply held beliefs.

Brené Brown: Yes. I mean, yes. And just -- just for the record, this is for me, don't quote her, quote me, you don't get God. Like -- like, no party gets God. No group gets God.

Kamala Harris: No, no, no. Of course not.

Brené Brown: Like, that's -- that's a terrible way to weaponize God, and it's just not what we're talking about. And I feel -- I feel -- I have to tell you, I feel the same way about the co-opting of patriotism.

Kamala Harris: Yeah, I agree.

Brené Brown: Like, you know, I think patriotism is protest, disagreement, debate.

Kamala Harris: And it is the highest form of patriotism, I believe, to fight for the ideals of our country.

Brené Brown: Yes.

Kamala Harris: Right?

Brené Brown: That fragile and strong democracy.

Kamala Harris: That's exactly right. And so, in this election, fighting for free and fair elections, fighting for the fact that we will have a president who does not aspire to be a dictator, admiring people like the president of Russia. We will have in our leaders those who vow to uphold and protect the Constitution of the United States, not terminate it.

Kamala Harris: Isn't that -- aren't those -- those examples of what we believe patriotism to be, which is the love of our country, understanding the oath and the responsibility, in particular, that elected leaders --

Brené Brown: Yes.

Kamala Harris: Have --

Brené Brown: That's it.

Kamala Harris: To foundational principles. [Begin audiotape]

Kara Swisher: Hi, folks. This is Kara Swisher. This week, in my podcast "On with Kara Swisher," I'm talking to Tony Stark, also known as Iron Man, also known as Oscar-winning actor Robert Downey Jr., about his Broadway debut in "McNEAL." He plays a writer who goes down the AI rabbit hole and doesn't come out.

Robert Downey Jr.: We are in a new era where I believe that we ultimately will wrest control of these things because the few may have had too much power for too long. But I feel that McNEAL, particularly --

Kara Swisher: Right.

Robert Downey Jr.: People are leaving the theater feeling a little bit less terrified and a little more hopeful because they're feeling that this was ultimately a human story.

Kara Swisher: Along with playwright Ayad Akhtar and Director Bart Sher, we talked about the play, the implications of AI for creatives, and whether or not new tech can change social power dynamics. We also talked about the MCU. Of course, I'm a huge fan. Have a listen to "On with Kara Swisher" wherever you get your podcasts. [End audiotape]

Brené Brown: I -- I have to read this to you because when I read this -- I heard about it in the news, but when I read the National Security Leaders for America letter --

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Brené Brown: So, I do a ton of work with the military and with veterans. I know some of the people who signed this letter. These -- these people are not kidding around.

Kamala Harris: And they're not political people.

Brené Brown: They're not political people. And if they were, I would imagine they were probably conservative Republicans, to be honest with you.

Kamala Harris: I agree with you.

Brené Brown: Yeah. And so, I just want to read part of it. "We are former public servants." This is on September 22, 2024. "We are former public servants who swore an oath to the Constitution. Many of us risked our lives for it. We are retired generals, admirals, senior noncommissioned officers, ambassadors, and senior civilian national security leaders.

Brené Brown: We are Republicans, Democrats, and independents. We are loyal to the ideals of our nation like freedom, democracy, and the rule of law, not to any individual or party. We do not agree on everything, but we all adhere to two fundamental principles. First, we believe in America's national security requires a serious and capable commander in chief.

Brené Brown: Second, we believe American democracy is invaluable. Each generation has a responsibility to defend it. That is why we, the undersigned, proudly endorse Kamala Harris to be the next president of the United States. This election is a choice between serious leadership and vengeful impulsiveness. It is a choice between democracy and authoritarianism.

Brené Brown: Vice President Harris defends America's democratic ideals, while former President Donald Trump endangers them."

Kamala Harris: So, I -- as vice president of the United States, I have now met over 150 world leaders: presidents, prime ministers, chancellors, and kings. Many of them multiple times. We're on a first-name basis. When we walk in those rooms around the world representing the United States of America, we have traditionally been able to walk in those rooms chin up, shoulders back, with the earned and self-appointed authority to talk about things like democracy and rule of law.

Brené Brown: That's right.

Kamala Harris: But being a role model means people watch what you do to see if it matches up to what you say.

Brené Brown: And look for one opportunity to dismiss --

Kamala Harris: What otherwise, imperfect though we may be, is a gold standard --

Brené Brown: Right.

Kamala Harris: If not the gold standard. And I will tell you that part of my hope and prayer for us as a country is that among the stakes that we understand are at play in this election, that -- that we all understand how important America is to the rest of the world. I really -- I -- I hope and I pray we fully understand what we mean to the rest of the world --

Brené Brown: I know. Yeah.

Kamala Harris: Where people in various parts of the world are fighting for democracy, where women are fighting for their ability to be educated, to have rights. And so, you know, these national security leaders, having their support and endorsement, I'm deeply honored, but it also is testament to the fact that -- just like John Kelly recently speaking out publicly about -- his concerns about Trump and fascism and all of that.

Kamala Harris: Think of their letter as a 911 call to the American people.

Brené Brown: I -- I -- it took my breath away.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Brené Brown: They talked about your steadfastness in the Situation Room.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Brené Brown: They talked about your toughness.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Brené Brown: And they talked with real fear about what would happen that Trump would remain absolutely unchecked and has developed relationships far deeper than what we understand with some of the most dangerous people threatening everything we believe in.

Kamala Harris: And this is not 2016 or 2020.

Brené Brown: No.

Kamala Harris: He is also increasingly unstable.

Brené Brown: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: And unhinged. And the significance of even the words that you read about -- you know, I -- I asked people to imagine -- we can all picture the Oval Office. You've seen it on TV. Imagine the Oval Office in your head, just imagine it, on January 20th of 2025. If Donald Trump is sitting there, he will be stewing over his enemies list.

Brené Brown: Oh, I -- I think that's true. People will talk about their fear.

Kamala Harris: Right? Versus what I intend to do, which is sitting there, thinking of the American people, working on my to-do list. There's a big difference.

Brené Brown: Now, the gotcha list and the to-do list. I mean, this -- this goes back to the difference of loyalists to serve him --

Kamala Harris: That's right.

Brené Brown: And --

Kamala Harris: We've come full circle.

Brené Brown: Expert. Yes.

Kamala Harris: That's right.

Brené Brown: So, fifth-generation Texan, I cannot let you out of this conversation without saying that I'm really scared for the women in my state.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Brené Brown: I'm scared for my daughter.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Brené Brown: I spoke Monday in San Antonio to 7,500 educators, and I want to tell you something that really was devastating to me. On stage, I was asked by the person facilitating the conversation what I thought about the fact that some of their members, these educators, did not come because it was being held in San Antonio, and they would not come because of the Machiavellian abortion laws here.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Brené Brown: And I thought, well, I believe in standing up for what you believe in. And as it turns out -- I can barely talk about it. I mean, as it turns out, many of the women who chose not to come actually chose not to come because they are pregnant.

Kamala Harris: I know. I assume that's where you're going because I've heard --

Brené Brown: Yeah, they were afraid.

Kamala Harris: There's -- there are a lot of --

Brené Brown: If something happened --

Kamala Harris: There are a lot of pregnant women who do not want to travel to states with Trump abortion bans for exactly that reason that God forbid something happens, God forbid they are experiencing difficulty with their pregnancy or miscarriage --

Brené Brown: Yeah, like clotting or bleeding.

Kamala Harris: Absolutely.

Brené Brown: Then, all of a sudden, their choices are --

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Brené Brown: Go to jail or die.

Kamala Harris: It's -- again, this gets back to the fact that we must be vigilant and we have to remember that we can never take our rights for granted. Back to your point about talking with folks about whether they should get very activated around this election --

Brené Brown: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: And knock on doors and tell people why they care --

Brené Brown: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: And why it matters and why they should vote.

Brené Brown: Yes.

Kamala Harris: This is the day. This is the time.

Brené Brown: This is the fight.

Kamala Harris: Because this is -- this is. And I mean, the fundamental -- the notion that in the United States of America in this year of our Lord 2024, that women don't have the right to make decisions about their own body, I mean, what could be more fundamental? We're not talking about property rights. We're literally talking about the right to make decisions about your own body.

Kamala Harris: And in Texas, the law provides up to prison for life for a physician, a health care provider for performing the care that they deem in the best interest of their patient. And can you imagine, what's happening now is that I've talked to a lot of physicians and medical school professors --

Brené Brown: Oh, yeah.

Kamala Harris: And they're seeing a decline in their post-docs --

Brené Brown: For sure.

Kamala Harris: Who want to go into family -- or go into family medicine, in particular, reproductive health care because these students are -- they're -- they don't want to go to states. And that we now have 20 states with Trump abortion bans. And you already look at the fact that we still have the -- the sad reality of America is we still have the highest rate of maternal mortality of any so-called wealthy nation.

Kamala Harris: If you look at the reasons behind that, it includes the lack of appropriate and adequate care for women in the context of their reproductive systems --

Brené Brown: Yes.

Kamala Harris: Whether it be pre-pregnancy, during pregnancy, postpartum. We have so many deserts -- we call them deserts for maternal care.

Brené Brown: Oh, yeah.

Kamala Harris: And you have then the effect that includes that people don't want to go into reproductive health care. I'm the first vice president and never has there been a president who has gone to a reproductive health clinic. I wanted to go because I wanted to highlight the fact that in these clinics, also, it's not only abortion care.

Kamala Harris: That's where they do Paps. They do breast cancer screenings.

Brené Brown: I mean, I --

Kamala Harris: They do HIV screenings.

Brené Brown: I saw nobody except a Planned Parenthood nurse practitioner --

Kamala Harris: Right.

Brené Brown: For 15 years.

Kamala Harris: But exactly right, and because you knew and so many people know, you walk into that clinic and that's where you're going to be treated with dignity. You're not going to be judged. It's a safe place. That's what these clinics offer. Usually, they are run by women. And they're closing in many places because of the laws that are present in those states.

Kamala Harris: So, you're talking about so many ramifications, whether it be students going into to -- to medical practice for reproductive care, whether it be clinics closing, whether it be pregnant women not wanting to travel, whether it be kids like some of my godchildren who in high school are -- are making college application decisions based on which state --

Brené Brown: Oh, for sure.

Kamala Harris: Right? The ramifications of this highlight a fact, which is that Donald Trump, through his decision to put those three members on the Supreme Court to undo Roe, has created a health care crisis in America. This is a health care crisis.

Brené Brown: This is a health care crisis, for sure. OK. Our time is up. I'm getting a --

Kamala Harris: Darn.

Brené Brown: I'm getting a sign. We could keep going, but --

Kamala Harris: I know. Like, I could sit here and talk to you all afternoon.

Brené Brown: Yeah. I'm going to end with something that we always end up with, which is part of the rapid fire. Just one question.

Kamala Harris: OK.

Brené Brown: A snapshot of an ordinary moment in your life that gives you true joy.

Kamala Harris: Sunday family dinner, hands down. In -- in my normal life, I love to cook, and Sunday family dinner is non-negotiable. Everyone comes, whoever's in town. They can bring their friends. And I cook. We have our routines. Sunday family dinner, hands down.

Brené Brown: We have a big Sunday family dinner, too. I mean --

Kamala Harris: Really?

Brené Brown: We hold hands and sing grace, it's the whole thing.

Kamala Harris: Really?

Brené Brown: Yeah, yeah, we do. Yeah. I will say the snapshot of an ordinary moment in my life that gives me true joy is you and your commitment to justice and your commitment to duty and service, and I am as activated as I can be, and I can't --

Kamala Harris: Thank you for your voice. I said it to you before we started the program, but you give voice to so many people who rightly must be seen and heard. And you talk about leadership. What you do with your voice and your platform is really build community in a very important way, and I thank you for that because that's in the best interest of all of us.

Kamala Harris: So, thank you, and it's great to be with you. I look forward to talking with you again.

Brené Brown: I do, too. Let's fight and win.

Kamala Harris: Yes, we will.

Brené Brown: OK.
