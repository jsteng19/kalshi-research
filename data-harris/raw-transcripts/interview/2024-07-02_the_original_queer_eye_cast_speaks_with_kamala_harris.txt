Jonathan Van Ness: Pride.

Kamala Harris: Happy pride.

Karamo Brown: Happy pride. We're going to get to work. We're going to get to work. That's what it is.

Jonathan Van Ness: Access to reproductive health care affects our communities so much.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Karamo Brown: Yeah, it does.

Jonathan Van Ness: Something we don't think about a lot. So, thank you so much for doing that and fighting the good fight. And also, can I just say, one thing that I just learned about you last night that really blew my mind, and I've told everyone that will listen ever since, your campaign manager -- correct me if I'm wrong.

Jonathan Van Ness: Your first campaign manager was Harvey Milk's campaign manager?

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Karamo Brown: Really?

Carson Kressley: Wow.

David Collins: Amazing.

Kamala Harris: Jim Rivaldo.

David Collins: That's extraordinary.

Kamala Harris: I mean, yeah. He was a really special -- you know, they're so -- and, of course, they were -- you know, they were the -- they were the -- you know, they were really, I want to say, the fathers of, you know --

Karamo Brown: Yes, yeah.

David Collins: [inaudible]

Kamala Harris: Of the movement.

Karamo Brown: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: They were the fathers of the movement, right?

David Collins: For sure. Without question.

Kamala Harris: And so -- and, Rivaldo, as we called him, he was like a family member to us by the end of it all. He was just family. In fact, my mother took care of him as he was sick and dying and he had AIDS.

Karamo Brown: Wow.

Carson Kressley: Wow.

Kamala Harris: And -- and Rivaldo felt so Strongly about the movement being a function of many things, including a collective fight for freedom and for justice and -- and the importance of community. But the importance of, in particular, coalition building. Right? So, Rivaldo was an Italian American, white gay man.

David Collins: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: Who loved Black people. He believed in a Black woman being the first Black woman to be the DA of a major city. Right?

Jonathan Van Ness: Amazing. Amazing.

Kamala Harris: He would talk about how he and Harvey and the leaders of the movement always understood the interconnection.

Karamo Brown: Yes.

David Collins: Of all of us

Kamala Harris: Right.

David Collins: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: And the interconnection of struggle.

Carson Kressley: Right.

Kamala Harris: Right? And so, yeah. And so, he was. And he was -- he was so special. He -- he actually -- he was a very special person. He -- and he was very talented. He was actually a part of Harvard Lampoon in the earliest days of it.

David Collins: Wow.

Jai Rodriguez: Wow.

Carson Kressley: OK.

Kamala Harris: Which you guys would appreciate, right?

Karamo Brown: Yeah.

David Collins: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: Yeah, he was a very, very special person. So, yeah.

Jonathan Van Ness: It means so much. And hearing the way that your family -- I've been living with HIV for over 10 years. And I think it's a really interesting example of intersectionality when we look at what's happening with Planned Parenthood. We think of Planned Parenthood --

Kamala Harris: That's right.

Jonathan Van Ness: As someone who provides reproductive access, which they do. I also found out that I was HIV positive at Planned Parenthood.

Kamala Harris: That's exactly right.

Jonathan Van Ness: And without their testing, without the access to that testing, I don't even know where I would be. And so, it's so important that we think about funding intersectionality, making sure that we can protect institutions that are protecting people. And thank you for doing that so much, by the way.

Kamala Harris: What you do -- you're so right. So, OK. As it turned out, I went to a Planned Parenthood clinic a few months ago now because I wanted to highlight this point which is that when all of these abortion bans happen in the states where it has happened, these clinics have had to shut down. And they provide so much care.

David Collins: Yeah.

Karamo Brown: Yeah.

Jai Rodriguez: So many other services.

Kamala Harris: Including HIV testing.

Karamo Brown: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: They provide, I mean, screenings of every sort. And the thing about these clinics, which I'm sure you could talk about and we have all seen, they give people dignity.

Karamo Brown: Yes.

David Collins: Yes.

Kamala Harris: They're trusted.

Karamo Brown: Yes.

Kamala Harris: They're in touch with the community.

Karamo Brown: Yeah.

David Collins: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: People know that that's a place you can go for health care where you will receive dignity, and you will not be judged.

David Collins: Judged.

Karamo Brown: Yes.

Jai Rodriguez: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: And that's so important. We have to always appreciate that because it's not always the case.

Jai Rodriguez: Oh, yeah. I mean there's certain communities where --

Kamala Harris: Right?

Jai Rodriguez: You're scared to ask about --

Carson Kressley: Right.

Jai Rodriguez: Getting HIV tested, or even if you find out that you are positive, to have a doctor that's going to give you proper medications or preventative things like PrEP. People are scared to ask their physician because they have to come out to them.

Carson Kressley: Right.

Kamala Harris: That's exactly right.

Jai Rodriguez: And that might not be a safe environment with that doctor.

Kamala Harris: That's exactly -- that's exactly right. And so, the -- I'm so glad you raised that because the intersection around all of these issues. It turned out I was the first vice president of the United States to ever go to a reproductive care clinic.

Karamo Brown: Really?

Jonathan Van Ness: Wow.

Carson Kressley: Wow.

Karamo Brown: Thank you, first of all.

Kamala Harris: It's -- it --

Karamo Brown: No, we got to take a moment and say thank you for that because that's big.

Kamala Harris: Right?

Karamo Brown: You know what I mean?

Kamala Harris: But to highlight these exact points.

Jonathan Van Ness: But it shows the way that women's reproductive health care hasn't been highlighted by so many administrations. And so, thank you so much for doing that.

Karamo Brown: Yes.

Kamala Harris: Thank you.

Karamo Brown: Seriously. Thank you. And PrEP, I mean, when I was in the Senate, we fought to make sure that the medication would be available and that insurance would cover it.

Jonathan Van Ness: Yes.

Jai Rodriguez: Yes.

Kamala Harris: Right?

Jai Rodriguez: We started -- I do a lot of work around HIV prevention. And we started using language like men who have sex with men --

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Jai Rodriguez: Because some people who engage and that don't identify as gay bisexual or queer, right?

Karamo Brown: Right.

Jai Rodriguez: And so --

Kamala Harris: Right. Right.

Jai Rodriguez: How are you messaging to folks as a preventative -- I mean, listen, many of us remember, you know, 20 years ago plus, we're all wearing red ribbons. We've gone to so many --

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Jai Rodriguez: HIV fundraisers. Now, we have so many incredible tools to help folks who are positive live, great lives and those who are negative stay negative to remain negative. We know that U equals U, undetectable --

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Jai Rodriguez: Means untransmittable.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Jai Rodriguez: We have the information. We all have been to things where we helped fundraise to get to where we are. And there is a journey to go until there's a cure.

Kamala Harris: Right.

Jai Rodriguez: However, the stigma is still there. And so, if you can't even see a physician and get the care you need, how will we stop HIV, AIDS?

Kamala Harris: That's exactly right. That's exactly right. And I mean, remember that -- remember during the height of -- of the AIDS epidemic how badly people were being treated. I mean, it was just -- it was awful. And again, the -- the stereotypes, the myths, compounded with the lack of services.

Carson Kressley: Right.

Kamala Harris: And --

Jai Rodriguez: You use that word dignity. I don't mean to interrupt.

Kamala Harris: It's so important.

Jai Rodriguez: It's the -- it's the most important thing. I did Rent for five years, and there's a lyric that says "Will I lose my dignity?"

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Jai Rodriguez: Will someone care? And it was a support group for those living with HIV. And I just think about that because I lost my aunt in 1996. And I watched firsthand what it was like for a woman who was heterosexual, who had 2.5 kids, the car, the house, the boat, and the way she was treated. I remember I took her to a dentist appointment and the -- the dentist put on four pairs of gloves.

Jai Rodriguez: And I watched my aunt --

Kamala Harris: Wow.

Jai Rodriguez: Turn away from him, wipe a tear. And I'll never forget that. Like, that stayed with me forever. The fact that we can't treat people with the same dignity that we all respect. It's not a bad person's disease.

Karamo Brown: Yeah. But you being in this position and what you're doing is what makes this so impactful because I have aunts, uncles, family members, who, before they saw you and the way you approached everyone with the same love care and dignity, they did not approach people of different communities --

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Karamo Brown: People of our community with that same pride. But because they see you and you reflect back to them themselves, they've changed. And I've seen it firsthand since you've been in office. And that's why I admire you so much because you are just standing in your -- in your light. Your presence has changed people who used to be like, "No, I can't do that.

Karamo Brown: I'm not doing that. I'm not saying that." And all of a sudden, they see you and they're like, "OK, that's my girl. I can -- I can do that. I can do that now." And it's -- but it's so impactful. And we know how one -- one person who you admire and respect changing and being -- standing in their truth and treating people with dignity and love how it just ricochets across the world.

Karamo Brown: So, thank you.

Kamala Harris: Thank you.

Karamo Brown: Yeah, you're welcome.

Kamala Harris: I'm very touched that you shared that with me.

Karamo Brown: Yeah, you're welcome.

Kamala Harris: I think it's -- you know, there's -- I've been talking a lot recently about what I think we've all sadly witnessed over the last several years, which is this suggestion that the measure of the strength of the leader is based on who you beat down instead of what we know. The true measure of the strength of a leader, elected, in whatever position they're in, the true measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up.

Carson Kressley: Absolutely. Amen.

David Collins: Amen.

Kamala Harris: Right? Like that's -- you want to know your strength.

Karamo Brown: Yes.

Kamala Harris: Right? And the idea that it's a sign of weakness to have empathy when, in fact, isn't that the sign of the strength of character --

Karamo Brown: Yes

Kamala Harris: Which is to have some level of concern and care about the suffering, the well-being of other people, and then take it upon yourself to do something about it? I think we all agree that that is actually a character strength.

Karamo Brown: Yes.

David Collins: That's the heart

Kamala Harris: Right?

Karamo Brown: Yeah.

Michael Williams: That's the heart of the show.

David Collins: That's the heart of Queer Eye, right? Twenty years ago, it may have been --

Kamala Harris: Right.

David Collins: You know, a bit of a make-better series, but the evolution really was about heart and humor and transformation.

Kamala Harris: Can you tell -- it was such an incredible groundbreaking thing that history now, 20 years later, I think everyone understands what you guys did to -- to really -- to just talk about giving fuel --

Karamo Brown: Yup.

Kamala Harris: To people's sense of -- their consciousness about --

David Collins: It was a wake-up.

Kamala Harris: Who is what.

Karamo Brown: Yeah.

David Collins: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: And how we should all think about ourselves in relation to each other. How did that come about? Like, what -- what happened?

Jonathan Van Ness: It's a really cute story.

Karamo Brown: Yeah, it is a cute story. Yeah.

Michael Williams: A pretty story. So, back 20 years ago, when we started, we tried to register the name, Queer Eye, in New York. It was illegal.

Kamala Harris: No.

Jai Rodriguez: Wow.

Karamo Brown: I didn't know that.

David Collins: Queer was [inaudible]

Michael Williams: Queer was derogatory. It was -- you could not use it in any business.

Kamala Harris: Because it was considered derogatory.

David Collins: Derogatory.

Kamala Harris: Right, right.

Michael Williams: And actually, a few years in the beginning of our season, we filmed in Gay, Georgia and a guy -- a town.

David Collins: Gay, Georgia.

Kamala Harris: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I figured that like.

Michael Williams: But on legal forms, you create this new word gay.

Jai Rodriguez: Well, no one -- season one vendors were like, "We don't want to work with you guys --"

Carson Kressley: Right.

Jai Rodriguez: Because you have the word queer.

Karamo Brown: Queer.

David Collins: Queer in your title.

Jai Rodriguez: Big, big, big vendors.

Kamala Harris: Really?

Jai Rodriguez: I'm not going to throw anybody under the bus. We've evolved and changed.

Kamala Harris: But you have not forgotten.

Jai Rodriguez: I won't shop there. I'll get my groceries somewhere else. But -- no, no, no, but that's --

Michael Williams: Jai, tell the story.

David Collins: I mean, the long story short is we were in Boston, Massachusetts. South End, kind of Boston's gay neighborhood, right?

Kamala Harris: Right. Yeah.

David Collins: And it was a Sunday afternoon. I'd like to call it -- it was the perfect storm of luck, timing and, God, right?

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

David Collins: we walked into this big studio warehouse. There was like 100 people, all looking at art drinking their champagne --

Kamala Harris: Yeah. Yeah.

David Collins: And eating cheese. And all of a sudden, there's this weird hush came over the room. And everyone was like, "What's going on?" In the middle of the room, some woman just starts berating her husband, "Look at you," for the way he looks. "Your hair, your shirt, your dress."

Karamo Brown: Right.

David Collins: And then, out of -- everyone went into slow motion across the room for unbelievably handsome, well-quaffed men came strolling across, and they surrounded the man and pushed the wife aside like, "Ma'am, that's not what we do." And they just started loving on him. And that's coming back to your story. They just tucked in his shirt, fixed his hair like, "No, you're great.

David Collins: Confidence breeds success."

Kamala Harris: That's right.

David Collins: Really is where this was born from. I turned to Michael, and just out of my head, I said, "Did you see that? That was like queer eye for the straight guy." And when it came out of my mouth, I said --

Kamala Harris: Oh.

Michael Williams: One -- one year from now, that'll be a hit on TV.

Kamala Harris: Oh.

David Collins: True. And -- and it was less than a year later that we were -- we were really fortunate to take it to Bravo 20 years ago --

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

David Collins: When it was a tiny, little network. And these two get credit because they were the first --

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

David Collins: Gay men to be out there being who they were, telling their story and sharing.

Jai Rodriguez: Do you remember that was a big deal. You guys said -- I remember -- I don't know if you knew this, but on our end --

Carson Kressley: Right.

Jai Rodriguez: The criteria was, yes, you had to fit into the umbrella of your category, but you had to be openly gay. And as an actor, I remember thinking, "Oh, so then, I'll walk into rooms and spaces, and everyone will know." And for context, in 2003 --

David Collins: Yeah.

Karamo Brown: Oh, yeah.

Jai Rodriguez: I mean, even the queer cast that we're doing or the shows that had queer content, many of the actors who were queer were closeted and/or being portrayed by straight folks. So, it was a big deal --

David Collins: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: Oh, yeah.

Carson Kressley: Right.

Jai Rodriguez: In the sense that just being out --

Jonathan Van Ness: I mean, it was --

Jai Rodriguez: Was crazy.

Jonathan Van Ness: The Bush administration, right?

Carson Kressley: I mean, I didn't have to worry. They already knew.

Michael Williams: You didn't come out to your family --

Jai Rodriguez: Wait --

Michael Williams: You did a show --

Carson Kressley: Oh, I did -- yeah, we were going to be on the cover of TV Guide. And I was like, I guess I better tell my family. And mom was like, "What's the show called? I'm like, "I don't know, something about makeover." I picked a very rainy, stormy day in a minivan. I was like, if she freaks out, she'll kill all of us. And it was the classic like, "Hello?

Carson Kressley: Of course, we know you're gay.

Kamala Harris: Right, right.

Carson Kressley: But, you know, the coming out process, the show helped me to come out personally.

David Collins: yeah.

Carson Kressley: And one of the most grateful things I am for that show is that so many young people come up to me today on airplanes or in the mall and say, "Your show helped me come out --"

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Carson Kressley: Because it allowed a safe dialog with my family to say, "Oh, gay is OK." And, you know, we were some of the first gay people that people met.

David Collins: They got to see a real role model.

Carson Kressley: I was like have you not been on an airplane? Have you not had highlights?

Kamala Harris: Right.

Carson Kressley: But that -- it was -- it was not meant to be a -- a -- to change the philosophy of our country, but it was a very subversive thing --

David Collins: Yeah.

Carson Kressley: Because we were just coming in and doing good work --

Karamo Brown: Yeah.

Carson Kressley: And being joyful warriors.

Kamala Harris: That's right.

Jai Rodriguez: And also, you never saw and queer folks depicted as friends.

David Collins: Kind of coming together.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Jai Rodriguez: Which -- by the way, we started on a Tuesday and ended on a Thursday, at least our time with our hero character.

Carson Kressley: Right.

Jai Rodriguez: Sometimes, they were not so -- they signed up for it, but sometimes, they present it as prickly, homophobic, scared of us. And by the end, they would be emotionally --

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Jai Rodriguez: I mean, I'm sure you guys can --

David Collins: We used a filter -- we used a filter called transformation through information told with comedy and heart.

Kamala Harris: Nice.

David Collins: And the transformation, sure. You get a new dress, a new outfit, a nice new sofa.

Kamala Harris: Right.

David Collins: But really, it's about the sharing of our stories, right?

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

David Collins: I tell you my story, you tell me yours.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

David Collins: We see each other's humanity.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

David Collins: And we lift each other up. And -- and I do say a lot, you know, confidence breeds success. When I tell you something about myself and you tell me, we get to lift each other and share our --

Carson Kressley: Right.

David Collins: Our connection, our humanity.

Kamala Harris: That's exactly right.

David Collins: And that's the heart of what Jonathan and Karamo and our teams do, 20 years of this --

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

David Collins: For Michael and I to look at that, we're -- we're proud papa and daddy.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

David Collins: We have 15-year-old daughters. And we have a daughter who has really never had to come out. She identifies as lesbian. When she was 5-years-old, she caught my eye in the rear view mirror, and she says, "Daddy, I'm a girl, but I like boys things." And I was like, "I'm a boy and I love girls things. We're going to get along just fine." And -- and she's never had to live in a world where that fear of coming out --

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Carson Kressley: Right.

David Collins: Was part of her existence. She just gets to be Ella. And Ella is Ella. I know, how great.

Kamala Harris: Oh, you have an Ella.

David Collins: Ella and an Olive. We have twin girls, who -- speaking of reproductive rights, who we had through IVF --

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

David Collins: And gestational surrogacy. And the journey for he and I to become parents --

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

David Collins: Was a big deal. It was -- you know --

Michael Williams: Yeah.

David Collins: Twenty years ago we started and had to spend tons of money.

Kamala Harris: Yeah. Yeah.

David Collins: I look at other young gay couples now and I'm like, "Oh, I hope you don't have to cost as much as we did --"

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

David Collins: To try to have children --

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

David Collins: Through IVF surrogacy.

Michael Williams: I read some states -- some legislation -- some states trying to -- only straight married couples can have IVF.

Kamala Harris: It's --

David Collins: They have IVF.

Michael Williams: And I'm like -- and I look at my -- our 15-year-old and I'm like, "What?"

Karamo Brown: Yeah.

Jai Rodriguez: Yeah.

Michael Williams: They could be in this office someday.

David Collins: Yes.

Karamo Brown: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: And -- but, you know, this is the thing about this moment, right? You know there's a phrase from Coretta Scott King that I paraphrase all the time, all the time. And she famously said the fight for civil rights, which is the fight for equality, it's the fight for justice must be fought and won with each generation.

Karamo Brown: Exactly.

Carson Kressley: Absolutely.

Kamala Harris: And I think part of her point was that it's the nature of the progress and the gains that we make.

David Collins: Right.

Kamala Harris: They will not be permanent unless we are vigilant. We have to be vigilant. And so, the second point of that admonition then is, OK, understanding that's the nature of it all, do not despair.

David Collins: Right.

Kamala Harris: It's the nature of it.

Carson Kressley: Right.

Kamala Harris: Right? So just --

Jonathan Van Ness: Yes, [inaudible]

Kamala Harris: Right? Right. It's George Morgan.

Karamo Brown: Yes.

Jonathan Van Ness: Yes.

Kamala Harris: So, we just know what we have to do. Got it. Like got it. I understand that.

Karamo Brown: Got it.

David Collins: Yes.

Kamala Harris: Got it.

David Collins: Yeah.

Jonathan Van Ness: Because I have been a little down lately, so this is really good advice.

Karamo Brown: Yeah, good advice.

Jonathan Van Ness: It's the name of the game, we got to keep on working. Yes.

Kamala Harris: That's exactly right. We have -- we can't take any of these things for granted. And -- and let's also, you know, be fueled by the optimism to know that we can also get better than we are and that --

David Collins: Yeah.

Carson Kressley: Absolutely.

Kamala Harris: And that it's not only about maintaining the progress that we've achieved, but let's keep going.

David Collins: Level up, level up, level up.

Karamo Brown: Yeah

Kamala Harris: Like the Equality Act, we still need to get the Equality Act.

David Collins: Yes.

Karamo Brown: Yes, exactly. The Equality Act, yeah.

Jonathan Van Ness: Yeah, that's what I'm saying, the Equality Act. We'll bring it back. We're going to bring it back.

Kamala Harris: Right?

Jonathan Van Ness: That is not for 2018.

Kamala Harris: Right?

Jonathan Van Ness: We are gonna bring it back.

Kamala Harris: Yes.

Jonathan Van Ness: We just need the Democratic House and Senate to reintroduce it. Honey, it's going to happen.

Kamala Harris: Well, that's exactly right.

Karamo Brown: And it's going to happen.

Carson Kressley: Yes.

Kamala Harris: There's an election --

Jonathan Van Ness: Yes, yes.

David Collins: There is an election.

Kamala Harris: And there will be a lot of issues that are decided based on that election. And here's the thing. This election in November is asking each of us a very fundamental question: What kind of country do we want to live in?

David Collins: Yes. Yes.

Kamala Harris: And we each have the power to answer that mhm right and I think that's part of what we have to remind every one of. There are forces that are trying to divide us.

David Collins: Yes.

Kamala Harris: There are forces that are trying to make people feel small and outside, and we have to remind each other that no don't ever let anyone take your power from you, including the power of your voice through your vote. Right? And to remember that we're all part of a community of people who are propelled by, you know, love of thy neighbor.

Kamala Harris: Right?

David Collins: Yes.

Kamala Harris: And I think that's -- that's the thing that gives me a sense of optimism is knowing that the majority of us, I think, do value certain things, including that we fight for each other's dignity.

Karamo Brown: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: That we agree to the foundational principles of our country. Right? All equal.

David Collins: Yes.

Carson Kressley: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: Entitled to certain freedoms and certain rights.

David Collins: Yes.

Kamala Harris: That should not be taken.

David Collins: Yeah, right.

Jai Rodriguez: I think it's a good messaging because so many people in our community, especially young folks who feel charged and empowered, I think, can get bogged down by --

Carson Kressley: Right.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Karamo Brown: Well -- well, there's a -- well, if we're going to be real about it, there's -- there's a sort of apathy right now that we're seeing.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Karamo Brown: And one of the reasons why I'm excited to be here is because I want people to be reignited and be reengaged --

Kamala Harris: Yeah. Yeah.

Karamo Brown: Like, just because someone is making you feel down, making you feel small, making you feel like maybe I don't know if my voice is going to be heard, it is important for your voice to be heard.

Kamala Harris: That's right.

Karamo Brown: That's not when you get more quiet. That's when you get louder.

Kamala Harris: That's exactly right.

David Collins: Yes.

Carson Kressley: Yes.

Karamo Brown: And -- and I think what is so great about you having us is you're saying anyone who feels like maybe your voice isn't heard, come to the table, I'm willing to talk to you.

Kamala Harris: That's exactly right.

Karamo Brown: And I'm so thankful for this.

Kamala Harris: And your voice is welcome.

Karamo Brown: Welcome.

Kamala Harris: Right?

David Collins: Yeah.

Carson Kressley: Yeah.

Karamo Brown: Welcome, yes.

Kamala Harris: And it's -- it's legitimate, and it's important.

Karamo Brown: Yes.

Kamala Harris: Right? And it matters.

David Collins: [inaudible] stories, I'm a -- I'm a kid from Ohio, Cincinnati, Ohio, Southern Baptist, you know --

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

David Collins: Fire and brimstone.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

David Collins: And I love being able to go back and have conversations like, "Guess what? I'm just like you."

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

David Collins: I'm a daddy, I have kids, I work, I own a business. I work hard by the way.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

David Collins: I like -- and I still -- I love the Lord.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

David Collins: Yeah. I'm a -- I'm a gay Christian, and people are blown away when I have that conversation with them. And they're like, "What?"

Karamo Brown: Yeah.

David Collins: I'm like, "Yeah, it actually works." Believe it or not, my childhood foundation is not fire and brimstone.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

David Collins: It's love.

Kamala Harris: That's right.

David Collins: And we get to share that love with our children.

Karamo Brown: Yes, yes, yes.

David Collins: And our children --

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

David Collins: Get to see that in a whole new way. That -- that for me is really what work we all get to do. Our heroes, we call them episodic heroes, it's just a love fest because it's about them coming in on day one and having five amazing gay men just love on them for five days and love on them with fashion, grooming, interior design, culture, food and wine, but all at the same time, just reminding them that they're so loved and so valued --

Kamala Harris: That's right.

David Collins: And so seen. And that's what we need to keep doing here in America is reminding each other that we're all humans. We all love.

Kamala Harris: Amen.

David Collins: We all want to be -

Kamala Harris: Amen. Amen. You're right, it's -- it's -- it's really -- it is that fundamental.

David Collins: It is. It's that simple.

Kamala Harris: And that, you know, it's that -- and that each person has a right to, you know, I talked about it last night, to be.

David Collins: Yeah. Just to be.

Kamala Harris: Right?

Carson Kressley: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: And just to be --

David Collins: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: And to be safe in that --

David Collins: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: And to not be judged in that --

David Collins: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: And to receive the dignity to which all people are entitled. Right?

Karamo Brown: And deserves.

Kamala Harris: And deserve.

David Collins: Yeah.

Jonathan Van Ness: To every queer person and ally who has made pride possible, David, I think about 20 years of Queer Eye, your guys' vision has changed all of our lives the way that you guys have shown up, the way that you have shown up, Madam Vice President, and continue to show up in so much for Pride. You also tell the story of how life is like a relay when we're here.

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Jonathan Van Ness: So, the people that have come before us and carried their baton, the people who are here now that are currently carrying the baton --

Kamala Harris: Yeah.

Jonathan Van Ness: And for the young people that are coming, Happy Pride Day.

David Collins: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: Yes.

Jonathan Van Ness: Yes.

Jai Rodriguez: Yeah.

Carson Kressley: Yeah.

Kamala Harris: [inaudible]

Carson Kressley: Oh, can I add one last thing, too?
