Tim Walz: Wow. Wow, wow, wow. Hey -- [Audience chants "Gov"]

Tim Walz: [Laughs] [Applause] Wow. Wow.

Tim Walz: One more time for Tilly. Thank you. [Applause]

Tim Walz: Well, hello, Las Vegas. [Laughs] [Applause] Now, I know some of you spent the week googling Minnesota a little bit -- [laughter] -- and to figure out who these Minnesotans were.

Tim Walz: Here's the one thing I can tell you about us. We spend about half our lives talking about the weather. [Laughter] It's what we do. So, I want to say thank you to all of the people since I've been here to remind me that it's a dry heat outside. [Laughter] So -- so is your damn oven, but, you know, that's -- [laughter] -- I'm melting like a snowman outside.

Tim Walz: But, look, this is incredible. And I want to say a thank you to a few folks I had the privilege of working with when I served in Congress. You have two of the best senators you could ever hope for -- [applause]: Senator Cortez Masto and Senator Rosen.

Tim Walz: Just as a side note, there's lots of commonalities here -- it may not be the weather; we walk on water half the year it's so damn cold, but that's what we are. But we have something in common. Both Minnesota and Nevada have two women senators, and that's a pretty good thing. [Applause]

Tim Walz: Huge thank you to Congressman Horsford -- [applause]; Congresswoman Lee -- [applause]; and -- and a longtime friend I served with, Congresswoman Titus. Grateful. [Applause]

Tim Walz: A special thank you is for what I'm looking at right here: to every one of you. You took time out of your busy lives. You didn't need to be here. There's many things you could have been doing. You chose. You braved 108-degree heat -- I can't even believe I'm saying that -- [laughter] -- just to be here.

Tim Walz: And I have to tell you, I understand, because of the heat, they had to shut the door early and turn thousands of folks away. [Audience goes "Awww"]

Tim Walz: But don't worry, we're going to be back a lot. [Laughs] [Applause]

Tim Walz: All the things -- you got babysitters; you had to do everything -- but you came here for something bigger than yourselves for one simple, eloquent, and beautiful reason: You love this country. [Applause] Thank you. [Audience chants "USA"]

Tim Walz: USA!

Tim Walz: I'm so incredibly proud to be on this ticket -- and I want to give a big shout-out -- with the support of a special group tonight, Culinary Workers Union 226. [Applause]

Tim Walz: We're here for that love, and the end of this road -- remember, 87 days. Rarely in your life do you get an opportunity in 87 days to change the trajectory of not just today or tomorrow but for generations around the world. [Applause]

Tim Walz: And I keep saying this: We can do anything for 87 days. And my mantra is, "We'll sleep when we're dead." We'll sleep when we're dead. [Applause] Because when you wake up on that 88th day, you're going to get to say, "Welcome, Madam President Harris." [Applause]

Tim Walz: This is -- this is a leader that wakes up every day to try and do things for the American people. She will -- she took on the predators, the fraudsters, the transnational gangs; stood up against the greed of corporate interests -- [applause]; stood with working people in organized labor -- [applause]; and never failed to reach across the aisle if it meant improving people's lives. [Applause]

Tim Walz: I was taught a little something about that commitment too. I was born in a small town in Nebraska where community was a way of life. [Applause] There's some Nebraskans in the house. Yay, Cornhuskers.

Tim Walz: You think I'm kidding. You think I'm kidding. Four hundred people, 25 kids in my class, 12 were cousins. That's small town. [Laughter] That's small town.

Tim Walz: But you know what? My parents and my community taught me generosity towards my neighbor and to work for the common good. [Applause]

Tim Walz: My -- my dad was a chain-smoking, Korean War-era veteran, who two days after my 17th birthday took me down to sign up to join the National Guard. [Applause] I was proud, for the next 24 years, to wear the uniform of this country. [Applause]

Tim Walz: Thank -- thank you to every single one of you who wore that uniform. And I have to tell you, like my dad before me and millions of others, the G.I. Bill gave me a shot at a college education. [Applause]

Tim Walz: And just -- and just like Tilly, my dad was a teacher, my older brother was a teacher, my sister was a teacher, my younger brother was a teacher. [Applause] And we married teachers, so -- [laughter]. The privilege of my lifetime was spending two decades teaching in public schools t- -- [applause] -- and -- and, you might have heard, coaching football to a state championship, so -- [applause]. Here's -- [Audience chants "Coach"]

Tim Walz: Don't ever close that yearbook. That's my pro tip. [Laughter]

Tim Walz: Look, my students and my players are the ones who encouraged me to run for office. They saw in me what I hoped to instill in them: a commitment to a common good and something so important -- the belief, as each and every one of you came here as a single person, a single person can make a difference. [Applause] Can make a difference.

Tim Walz: Never planned in my life to run for office, but I think my life prepared me well. And when my neighbors and -- asked if I'd run for office, I was pretty clueless. I did not know that the district I was running in had only had one Democrat since 1892 before me. [Laughter] But my community graced me with the opportunity to represent them in the United States Congress for 12 years -- [applause] -- where I had the privilege of serving as the ranking member on the VA committee, working with Republicans to most -- pass the most extensive veterans package since the G.I. Bill. [Applause]

Tim Walz: I learned -- I learned the art of compromising without compromising my values. [Applause]

Tim Walz: And as -- now, as governor, I bring all those experience together to tackle the most pressing challenges we have in the great state of Minnesota. [Applause]

Tim Walz: Now each of you came here -- you came here because you love the country. You came here because you know a fantastic leader is going to walk out those doors in a minute or two, the person that you see bringing everything to us.

Tim Walz: But just be very clear here: Donald Trump sees the world very differently than all of us here. [Audience Boos]

Tim Walz: Each of you talk about service. Donald Trump knows nothing about service. [Applause] It's -- [Audience chants "We're not going back"]

Tim Walz: Yay.

Tim Walz: It's pretty hard to provide service to others when you're too busy looking out for only yourself. [Applause]

Tim Walz: Again and again and again Donald Trump made decisions to weaken this country to strengthen his own hand. He mocked our laws, he sowed division and chaos amongst our citizens, and that's to say nothing of his record as president.

Tim Walz: He froze in the face of the global COVID pandemic, and our neigh- -- and our neighbors died because of it. By not addressing COVID -- by not addressing COVID, he drove our economy into the ground. [Applause]

Tim Walz: And I just want to set the record straight, because facts do matter, and there's not an alternate set of facts. [Applause] Here's one for you: Violent crime was up during the Trump presidency, and that's even not counting his crimes. [Laughter]

Tim Walz: Some of you -- some of you gray-hair or no-hairs in here can actually remember a time when Republicans actually talked about freedom and believed in it. Not these guys. These are the guys that believe government should be free to invade your exam room with your doctor.  [Audience Boos]

Tim Walz: I'm sure it's true here in Nevada, as it's true in Minnesota: We respect our neighbors' rights to make their own personal choices. [Applause]

Tim Walz: We don't have to agree with them or make the same choice, but we know that this nation -- things work best when you mind your own damn business. When you mind your own damn business. [Applause]

Tim Walz: I don't -- I don't need any help -- I don't need any help from those guys telling me which books to read. [Applause]

Tim Walz: I sure the heck don't need any lecture about morality from those guys. [Applause]

Tim Walz: And the last thing they can mind their own damn business is I don't need any help from them talking about my family. [Applause]

Tim Walz: And this is where it gets personal, where they want to dictate things like IVF and reproductive care.  [Audience Boos]

Unidentified: We have somebody to help? We have water?

Unidentified: We need a medic.

Tim Walz: All right. Thanks for helping your neighbors. But I -- [applause] --

Tim Walz: You're going to help them? You're good? All right. Thank you.

Tim Walz: I remember those -- waiting for the phone calls. You'd go through the treatments. I would have my neighbor come over to have to give shots to my wife and things like that. And the phone would ring, and you would just hope so highly that it would be good news. And then when you found out the treatments didn't work, it was a darkness that could blot out the sun.

Tim Walz: So, I have to tell you, it wasn't by chance when that phone call finally came and we found out we were going to welcome our daughter into the world -- [applause] -- we -- we named her the most powerful word in the universe: Hope. Hope. [Applause]

Tim Walz: So, when you hear -- when you hear Kamala Harris and I talk about freedom -- we're very clear about this -- we mean the freedom to make your own health care decisions -- [applause] -- and that your children should be free to go to school without worrying about being shot dead in their classroom. [Applause]

Tim Walz: Look, again, I know Nevada is a lot like Minnesota. In Minnesota, we believe in the Second Amendment, but we also believe in commonsense gun violence laws. [Applause]

Tim Walz: Vice President Harris believes education be a -- should be a ticket to the middle class, not crippling student loan debt. [Applause]

Tim Walz: And we come here today because in 87 days, we're going to settle our political differences not through violence; we're going to settle it by beating them at the ballot box. [Applause]

Tim Walz: So, look, I keep saying this. This is a pretty -- a pretty simple thing here. This election is about the choice about what direction this country will go in. And I want to be clear, I know very clearly that I am preaching to the choir, but here's my words for you: The choir needs to sing. The choir needs to

Tim Walz: sing. [Applause]

Tim Walz: So, the other day I was saying this -- I started out by saying, "Don't believe Donald Trump when he plays dumb about 2025," but then I remembered, you don't believe him on anything, because that's what you shouldn't believe. [Applause]

Tim Walz: But, look, I coached football for enough years -- when somebody draws up a playbook, they plan on using it -- [applause] -- and when they do, they'll restrict our freedoms. When they do, they'll do what they've done: They'll rig the economy so that the middle class gets nothing and the rich get richer. [Audience boos]

Tim Walz: If this guy gets an opportunity again, he won't only pick up where he left off, it will be much worse than it was last time. He'll gut Social Security, pull your health care, underfund public schools -- all of it. [Audience chants "We're not going back"]

Tim Walz: That's damn right.

Tim Walz: Damn right. We're not going back. [Audience chants "We're not going back"]

Tim Walz: Look, this guy is not fighting for you or your family. He doesn't give a damn. And his running mate shares his dangerous and backward agenda. [Audience boos]

Tim Walz: I said this: All of my friends, we went to Yale, had billionaires fund our career, and then we write a book trashing our neighbors that raised us.

Tim Walz: Come on. We're better than that. We're better than that.

Tim Walz: And I said it -- I want to be clear: I didn't call anybody names. I spent enough years in that lunchroom to know bullies when I see them. I just made a very clear observation that they seem to be really concerned about. I pointed out that taking away reproductive freedoms, banning books, raising the price of inlin -- insulin, trying to hurt labor unions -- nobody is asking for that weird crap. No one is asking for it. [Applause]

Tim Walz: Here is the good news. We do the work -- this is about the future. We do the work, none of that's going to happen. Vice President Harris believes in those freedoms. She knows that every single person should get a chance at the middle class. She believes in something so beautiful: the promise of America. It's that simple: the promise of America. [Applause]

Tim Walz: Madam Vice President, I want to say thank you for putting the trust in me to be your running mate. [Applause] And I want to say, she has done so much. And with you together, it's reminded us about something. It's reminded us that this work can be about goodness. It can be about smiling. It's tough work, but we can be happy doing it. [Applause]

Tim Walz: And -- and Kamala Harris has done something that we for forever be grateful for her: She has brought out the joy in our politics. [Applause]

Tim Walz: Nevada, join me in welcoming the next president of the United States, Kamala Harris. [Applause]

Kamala Harris: Hey, Nevada! [Applause] Can we hear it for Tim Walz? [Applause]

Kamala Harris: Oh, it's so good to be back. Good evening, everyone. [Applause] Good evening. Good evening. [Applause]

Kamala Harris: Oh, I see lots of friends. Oh, it is good to be back. It is good to be back. [Applause] Thank you all. My goodness. [Applause]

Kamala Harris: S- -- but, seriously, isn't Tim Walz fantastic? [Applause]

Kamala Harris: And I know, for some folks, you're just getting to know him and you've heard he's had many titles over his life: governor, congressman, dad, husband, coach. [Laughs] [Applause] But in 87 days, our nation is going to know Coach Walz as vice president of the United States of America. [Applause] That's right.

Kamala Harris: And it is so good to be here with so many incredible leaders, including my dear friends Senator Catherine Cortez Masto -- [applause]; Senator Jacky Rosen -- [applause] -- who we will reelect to the United States Senate -- [applause]; Congressmembers Dina Titus -- [applause], Steven Horsford -- [applause], and Susie Lee. [Applause]

Kamala Harris: And I know Culinary 226 is in the house. [Applause] [Inaudible] -- [Audience chants "226"]

Kamala Harris: That's right. [Audience chants "226"]

Kamala Harris: And the culinary union, as everyone in Nevada knows, they have helped lead the way in our country for workers' rights and workers' dignity. [Applause]

Kamala Harris: And I have to say, for years, I've been so proud to work by your side. When I was attorney general of California, we worked together to crack down on wage theft. [Applause] When I was a United States senator, we fought together for paid family leave and medical leave. [Applause] And earlier this year, right here in Vegas, we celebrated your historic contract win. [Applause]

Kamala Harris: And it is my promise to everyone here, when I am president, we will continue our fight for working families of America -- [applause] -- including to raise the minimum wage -- [applause] -- and eliminate taxes on tips for service and hospitality workers. [Applause]

Kamala Harris: And, Nevada, today, I also bring greetings from our incredible president, Joe Biden. [Applause] Joe. [Audience chants "Joe"]

Kamala Harris: We love Joe. [Audience chants "We love Joe"]

Kamala Harris: That's great. That's great.

Kamala Harris: And I know -- I'm going to tell him what you all just said. [Laughter]

Kamala Harris: And I know we are all so deeply grateful to Joe Biden for his lifetime of service to our nation -- [applause] -- and he's not done. And he's not done.

Kamala Harris: So, as I said, it's so good to be back in Las Vegas. The last time I was here, I stopped by the practice for the Men's National Basketball Team before they headed out to the Olympics. [Applause]

Kamala Harris: And maybe you saw it on your phone, but just a few hours ago in Paris, they won the gold. [Audience chants "USA"]

Kamala Harris: And I got more for you. A few hours before that, our Women's National Soccer Team won the gold as well. [Audience chants "USA"]

Kamala Harris: USA. USA. That's right.

Kamala Harris: So, in one sport after another, Team USA continues to make our nation proud. [Applause] So much to celebrate. So much to celebrate.

Kamala Harris: So, Nevada, we have 87 days until the election -- 87 days. And here's the thing -- [Audience member calls out "We got your back"]

Kamala Harris: But here's the thing. Here's the thing. We know this will be a tight race until the very end, and so let's not pay too much attention to the polls, because we have some hard work ahead of us. But we like hard work. [Applause] Hard work is good work. [Applause] And with your help this November, we will win. [Applause] We will win. We will win. We will win. [Audience chants "We will win"]

Kamala Harris: And I know we are all clear -- toward that win, we are all clear about what we are up against.

Kamala Harris: As many of you know, before I was elected vice president, before I was elected a United States senator, I was an elected attorney general and, before that, district attorney. [Applause] And before that, I was a courtroom prosecutor. [Applause]

Kamala Harris: In those roles -- in those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds -- [applause]: predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, scammers who broke the rules for personal gain. So, Nevada, hear me when I say I know Donald Trump's type. [Applause] [Laughs] I do. I do. [Audience chants "Lock him up"]

Kamala Harris: Whoa, whoa, hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. The courts are going to take care of that. We just going to beat them in November. We'll beat them in November. [Applause] We'll beat them in November.

Kamala Harris: But I've certainly been dealing with people like him my entire career.

Kamala Harris: For example, as attorney general of California, I took on one of our country's largest for-profit colleges that scammed students. Well, Donald Trump ran a for-profit college that scammed students. [Audience boos]

Kamala Harris: Remember that.

Kamala Harris: As a prosecutor, I specialized in cases of sexual abuse. Well, Donald Trump was found liable for committing sexual abuse. [Audience boos]

Kamala Harris: As attorney general, I held Wall Street banks accountable for fraud. Well -- [applause] -- Donald Trump was just found guilty of fraud -- 34 counts. [Applause]

Kamala Harris: All of this is to say, in this campaign, I will proudly put my record against his every day of the week -- every day of the week. [Applause]

Kamala Harris: That being said, let's make no mistake: This campaign is not just about us versus Donald Trump. It is about two different visions for our nation: one, ours, focused on the future; the other focused on the past. [Audience chants "We're not going back"]

Kamala Harris: But we're not going back. [Audience chants "We're not going back"]

Kamala Harris: We're not going back. We are not going back.

Kamala Harris: And we're not going back because, Nevada, we fight for the future -- [applause] -- a future with affordable health care, affordable childcare, and paid leave. [Applause]

Kamala Harris: We fight for a future where we build a broad-based economy, where every American has an opportunity to own a home, to start a business, and to build wealth. [Applause]

Kamala Harris: We believe in a future where we lower the cost of living for America's families so they have a chance not just to get by but to get ahead -- to get ahead. [Applause]

Kamala Harris: Because, look, while our economy is doing well by many measures, prices for everyday things like groceries are still too high. You know it and I know it.

Kamala Harris: When I was attorney general, I went after price-fixing schemes, and when I am president, I will continue that work to bring down prices. [Applause] I will take on big corporations that engage in illegal price gouging, corporate landlords that unfairly raise rents on working families, and -- [applause] -- and take on Big Pharma and cap the cost of prescription drugs for all Americans. [Applause]

Kamala Harris: Unlike Donald Trump, I will always -- I promise you -- put the middle class and working families first. [Applause]

Kamala Harris: Because, you see, Tim Walz and I may not appear to have a whole lot in common, but we have so much in common. And I'll tell you what he and I know: The middle class built the United States of America -- [applause] -- and when the middle class is strong, America is strong. [Applause]

Kamala Harris: And so, while we together work to move our nation forward, Donald Trump has a different plan. Just look at his Project 2025 agenda. [Audience boos]

Kamala Harris: Which I keep saying, I can't believe they put that in writing. [Laughter] So, if he is elected, Donald Trump intends to give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations. [Audience boos]

Kamala Harris: He intends to cut Social Security and Medicare. [Audience boos]

Kamala Harris: And he intends to surrender our fight against the climate crisis. [Audience boos]

Kamala Harris: And I don't need to tell Nevada every day, because you feel the impact of extreme heat and drought. [Applause] You know the climate crisis is real. But Donald Trump, well, he claims it's a hoax. [Audience boos]

Kamala Harris: And on top of this, if Donald Trump were to win in November -- he won't -- [applause] -- but if he were to win in November, he intends to end the Affordable Care Act. [Audience boos]

Kamala Harris: Think about that. To take us back to a time when insurance companies had the power to deny people with preexisting conditions. [Audience boos]

Kamala Harris: You remember what that was like? Children with asthma. Breast cancer survivors. Grandparents with diabetes.

Kamala Harris: Look, America has tried these failed policies before, and we are not -- [Audience responds "going back"]

Kamala Harris: -- going back. [Applause] We are not going back. We are not going back. [Audience chants "We're not going back"]

Kamala Harris: No. And we are going to move forward. We will move forward. [Applause]

Kamala Harris: And in moving forward, we will take on the biggest issues facing our nation. For example, we will address the issue of immigration. [Applause]

Kamala Harris: I was the attorney of a border state -- attorney general of a border state. I went after transnational gangs, drug cartels, and human traffickers who came into our country illegally. I prosecuted them in case after case, and I won. [Applause]

Kamala Harris: We know our immigration system is broken, and we know what it takes to fix it: comprehensive reform that includes, yes, strong border security and an earned pathway to citizenship. [Applause]

Kamala Harris: But Donald Trump doesn't want to fix this problem. He talks a big game about a lot of things. [Laughter] But he talks a big game about border security, but he does not walk the walk.

Kamala Harris: Earlier this year, we had a chance to pass the toughest bipartisan border security bill in decades, but Donald Trump tanked the bill because he thought it would help him win an election. [Audience boos]

Kamala Harris: Well, when I am president, I will sign that bill into law. [Applause]

Kamala Harris: Nevada, ours is a fight for the future, and it is a fight for freedom. [Applause]

Kamala Harris: Across our nation, we have been witnessing a full-on assault on hard-won, hard-fought freedoms and fundamental rights: the -- the freedom to vote, the freedom to be safe from gun violence, the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride -- [applause] -- and the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. [Applause] A fight for freedom.

Kamala Harris: And on that last point, we all know how we got here. When he was president, Donald Trump handpicked three members of the United States Supreme Court -- [Audience boos]

Kamala Harris: -- because he intended for them to undo the protections of Roe v. Wade. And as he intended, they did.

Kamala Harris: Now in more than 20 states, there is a Trump abortion ban, many with no exceptions even for rape and incest. [Audience boos]

Kamala Harris: And be sure, if he were to win, he would sign a national abortion ban, which would outlaw abortion in every state, even Nevada. [Audience boos]

Kamala Harris: But we are not going to let that happen -- [applause] -- because we trust women. [Applause]

Kamala Harris: And when I am president of the United States and Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedoms, I will sign it into law. [Applause]

Kamala Harris: So, I know the folks who are here. I know the people of Nevada; you are Battle Born. [Applause] You are Battle Born. And if Donald Trump wants to pick a fight over our most fundamental freedoms, we say: Bring it on. Bring it on. [Applause] Bring it on. [Audience chants "Bring it on"]

Kamala Harris: Because we're ready. We're ready.

Kamala Harris: So, Nevada, generations -- generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom. Now the baton is in our hands. [Applause] Each and every one of us.

Kamala Harris: So, we who believe in the sacred freedom to vote will finally pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. [Applause]

Kamala Harris: And we who believe in the freedom to live safe from gun violence will finally pass an assault weapons ban, universal

Kamala Harris: background checks, and red flag laws. [Applause]

Kamala Harris: So much is on the line. So much is on the line in this election. And understand this is not 2016. This is not 2020. This time around, the stakes are even higher, and that's because last month, the Supreme Court of the United States basically told -- [Audience boos]

Kamala Harris: -- the former president that going forward, he will effectively be immune no matter what he does in the White House. [Audience boos]

Kamala Harris: But -- but think about what that means. Think about what that means.

Kamala Harris: So, Donald Trump has vowed to be a dictator on day one if reelected. [Audience boos]

Kamala Harris: He said he will weaponize, essentially, the Department of Justice against his political enemies. [Audience boos]

Kamala Harris: And even called for the, quote, "termination" of the Constitution of the United States. [Audience boos]

Kamala Harris: Let us be very clear: Someone who suggests we should terminate the Constitution of the United States should never again stand behind the seal of president of the United States. [Applause] Never again. [Audience chants "USA"]

Kamala Harris: That's right. That's right. That's right.

Kamala Harris: We know what we stand for as Americans. And, you know, it all comes down to this. We are here together because we love our country. [Applause] We love our country. And I do believe it is the highest form of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country. [Applause]

Kamala Harris: That is how we preserve the promise of America. And think about it, after all, the promise of America is what makes it possible for Tim Walz and me to be together on this stage today. [Applause] Think about that. Think about that. Think about it.

Kamala Harris: Two middle-class kids. One a daughter of Oakland, California -- [applause] -- who was raised by a working mother. I had a summer job at McDonald's. [Applause] The other, a son of the Nebraska plains, who grew up working on a farm. [Applause] Think about it. Think about it. Only in America is it possible that the two of them would be running together all the way to the White House. [Applause] Only in America.

Kamala Harris: Only in America.

Kamala Harris: So, look -- [Audience member calls out "We love you"]

Kamala Harris: And I love you back. [Applause] I love you back.

Kamala Harris: So, look, we are -- together, we are running this campaign on behalf of all Americans -- [applause] -- from red states to blue states, from the heartland to the coast. And when elected, we will govern on behalf of all Americans. [Applause] All Americans.

Kamala Harris: So, Nevada, ultimately, in this election, I believe we each face a question: What kind of country do we want to live in? A country of chaos, fear, and hate? [Audience responds "No"]

Kamala Harris: Or a country of freedom, compassion, and rule of law? [Applause]

Kamala Harris: And the beauty -- and the beauty of our democracy -- here's the thing. The beauty of our democracy is we each -- each person has the power -- each person has the power to answer that question. [Applause] The power is with the people. The power is with the people. [Applause] It's with the people.

Kamala Harris: And so, in the next 87 days, we need you to use your power -- [laughs] -- [applause] -- to knock on doors, register folks to vote, and make your voices heard. [Applause]

Kamala Harris: So, Nevada, today, I ask you: Are you ready to make your voices heard? [Applause]

Kamala Harris: Do we believe in freedom? [Applause]

Kamala Harris: Do we believe in opportunity? [Applause]

Kamala Harris: Do we believe in the promise of America? [Applause]

Kamala Harris: And are we ready to fight for it? [Applause]

Kamala Harris: And when we fight -- [Audience responds "We win"]

Kamala Harris: -- we win!

Kamala Harris: God bless you. God bless the United States of America. [Applause]
