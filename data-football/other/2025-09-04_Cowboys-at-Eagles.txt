[ct=30.414] THE EAGLES WHO WON THE TOSS,
[ct=31.796] DEFERRED THE OPTION TO THE

[ct=39.372] WE’VE GOT SUPER BOWL LX ON NBC.
[ct=43.879] WHO’S COMING WITH US?
[ct=48.359] >> TURPIN RETURNING.
[ct=49.538] DOWN THE SIDELINE.
[ct=51.573] OUT OF BOUNDS RIGHT AROUND THE
[ct=51.808] 32 YARD LINE.
[ct=52.766] THAT’S WHERE THE DALLAS OFFENSE
[ct=56.737] WILL BEGIN.
[ct=58.084] >> DAK PRESCOTT, MISSISSIPPI
[ct=58.084] STATE.

[ct=73.449] >> TYLER BOOKER, ALABAMA.
[ct=78.406] >> TERENCE STEELE.
[ct=79.846] >> Cris: OFFENSIVE LINE, BIG
[ct=81.446] PART OF THE STORY FOR DALLAS.
[ct=84.040] INJURY FOR THE EAGLES RIGHT
[ct=84.040] AWAY.
[ct=88.042] THEN VAN SUMEREN, LINEBACKER AND
[ct=92.100] FULLBACK, AND YOU CAN SEE HE IS
[ct=93.347] REALLY DISTRAUGHT ABOUT IT RIGHT
[ct=98.658] HERE HE IS ENGAGED IN BLOCKING.
[ct=98.658] MEANTIME, WHILE YOU’RE WATCHING
[ct=101.343] THIS REPLAY, A PENALTY FLAG HAS
[ct=102.640] GONE DOWN.
[ct=110.630] VAN SOUP ER
[ct=112.019] VANSMS SOUP SOUP REN GRABBED
[ct=114.680] HIS LEG AND WENT TO THE GROUND.
[ct=115.993] SEAN SMITH, THE REFEREE, HAD TO
[ct=117.298] GET BETWEEN THE TEAMS AND ONE OF
[ct=118.581] THE OTHER OFFICIALS THREW A
[ct=122.611] PENALTY FLAG.
[ct=122.611] NO SURPRISE, EDGY WITH THE
[ct=127.908] COWBOYS AND THE EAGLES.
[ct=130.558] FOR THE MOMENT, THE ATTENTION
[ct=137.242] AND THE DISAPPOINTMENT FOR THE
[ct=143.938] EAGLES, VAN SUMEREN, THEIR
[ct=143.938] FULLBACK.
[ct=145.166] ATTENTION ON THE DALLAS COWBOYS
[ct=146.539] AND HOW THAT PLAYED OUT
[ct=146.539] AFTERWARDS.
[ct=147.774] IT IS GOING TO BE ONE OF THOSE
[ct=151.865] STARTS ALREADY TO THE SEASON.
[ct=151.865] >> Mike: WE TALKED ABOUT THE
[ct=153.290] MOVEMENT OF THE KICKOFF.
[ct=157.181] IT’S TO PROMOTE MORE KICKOFF
[ct=157.181] RETURNS.
[ct=158.578] THE TOUCHBACKS NOW COME OUT TO
[ct=160.007] THE 35 YARD LINE --
[ct=161.168] >> Referee: UNSPORTSMANLIKE
[ct=161.168] CONDUCT.
[ct=163.809] DEFENSE, NUMBER 98.
[ct=169.138] NUMBER 98, DEFENSE, DISQUALIFIED
[ct=169.138] FROM THE GAME.
[ct=174.502] >> Cris: WHOA.
[ct=175.718] JALEN CARTER, THE FOCUS AND THE
[ct=177.131] STAR FOR THE COWBOYS -- FOR THE
[ct=179.883] EAGLES ON THE FRONT LINE, OUT
[ct=181.071] FOR THE GAME BEFORE THE SNAP.
[ct=182.463] HERE HE GOES.
[ct=182.463] HE WALKS THERE IN FRONT OF DAK
[ct=185.080] PRESCOTT.
[ct=187.748] DID HE SPIT?
[ct=193.228] DID HE SPIT ON HIM?
[ct=195.808] I THINK HE DID.
[ct=197.043] THERE YOU GO.
[ct=198.373] AND THE OFFICIAL WAS RIGHT
[ct=199.651] THERE.
[ct=203.755] TO THROW THE FLAG.
[ct=206.359] BRIAN NEIL, THE UMPIRE WHO WAS
[ct=209.037] KEEPING AN EYE ON THAT
[ct=210.322] CONFRONTATION, NO IDEA,
[ct=211.613] OBVIOUSLY, WHAT WAS SAID.
[ct=213.069] BUT JALEN CARTER OUT OF THIS
[ct=219.720] GAME BEFORE A SNAP.
[ct=220.999] CRIS, FIRST OF ALL, I GOT NO
[ct=222.469] IDEA WHAT HE’S THINKING.
[ct=223.659] AND SECOND, THIS IS MASSIVE IN
[ct=225.043] TERMS OF THE GAME.
[ct=226.363] >> Cris: I GOT TO TELL YOU, HE’S
[ct=226.363] THE BEST PLAYER THEY HAVE ON
[ct=228.989] THEIR DEFENSE.
[ct=230.442] AND ABOUT 80% OF WHAT WE WERE
[ct=233.036] GOING TO TALK ABOUT ON THIS
[ct=233.036] BROADCAST.
[ct=235.605] BECAUSE TO BEAT THE PHILADELPHIA
[ct=237.000] EAGLES, YOU HAVE TO DOUBLE TEAM
[ct=238.314] JALEN CARTER.
[ct=239.587] IF YOU DON’T, YOU DON’T GET YOUR
[ct=240.930] OFFENSE STARTED.
[ct=244.962] NOW YOU TAKE OFF THAT ONE PLAYER
[ct=246.264] ON THE DEFENSE THAT YOU HAD TO
[ct=248.903] FOCUS YOUR ATTENTION ON, AND
[ct=250.373] IT’S ALMOST LIKE MICAH PARSONS
[ct=251.521] NOW GONE FROM THE COWBOYS.
[ct=252.886] SAME IMPACT NOW WITH SAY LEN
[ct=254.341] CARTER GONE.
[ct=262.332] >> Mike: MEANTIME, THE INJURED
[ct=264.956] PLAYER, VAN SUMERAN, IS BEING
[ct=266.328] CARTED OFF THE FIELD.
[ct=270.159] SO YOU TALK ABOUT TRYING TO
[ct=270.159] REPEAT.
[ct=271.671] THE PATH IS NEVER EASY, RIGHT?
[ct=274.360] YOU DON’T PICK UP WHERE YOU LEFT
[ct=274.360] OFF.
[ct=275.571] AND BEFORE A SNAP, A PLAYER YOU
[ct=278.362] WERE COUNTING ON IS OUT FOR THE
[ct=278.362] SEASON, PERHAPS, WITH A LEG
[ct=287.569] INJURY ARE.
[ct=288.923] >> Mike: I CAN’T BELIEVE WHAT WE
[ct=290.152] JUST SAW.
[ct=291.533] FROM THE 47.
[ct=294.105] DAK PRESCOTT, JAVONTE WILLIAMS
[ct=295.441] IS NOW THE RUNNING BACK FOR
[ct=296.887] DALLAS INTO EAGLES TERRITORY AT
[ct=300.877] THE 46.
[ct=302.315] DAK PRESCOTT MISSED HALF OF LAST
[ct=304.963] YEAR AFTER THE HAMSTRING SURGERY
[ct=306.131] AND INJURY IN ATLANTA, IT FORCED
[ct=307.482] HIM TO HAVE TO STEP AWAY.
[ct=308.964] THERE HAVE BEEN MULTIPLE
[ct=310.177] INJURIES OVER THE LAST FEW
[ct=310.177] YEARS.
[ct=312.867] CRIS, WHEN HEALTHY, HE IS STILL
[ct=314.122] A VERY, VERY GOOD QUARTERBACK.
[ct=315.580] >> Cris: TWO YEARS AGO, HE
[ct=315.580] FINISHED SEC
[ct=316.806] BALLOT.
[ct=318.092] LET’S REMEMBER WHAT HE WAS
[ct=322.112] BEFORE HE GOT HURT A SEASON AGO.
[ct=323.547] >> Mike: DAK PUT IT IN THE HANDS
[ct=326.073] OF TURPIN, WHO RETURNED THAT
[ct=327.520] WITH GREAT SPEED FEATURED ON THE
[ct=328.773] SECOND DOWN FOR THE FIRST FIRST
[ct=328.773] DOWN OF THE DALLAS SEASON.
[ct=331.419] >> Cris: I THINK THIS IS GOING
[ct=332.845] TO BE ONE OF THE SURPRISES FOR
[ct=335.490] THIS SEASON IS HOW MUCH KaVONTAE
[ct=336.732] TURPIN IS BEING USED.
[ct=339.453] OF COURSE, WE SAW WHAT HE DID AS
[ct=339.453] A RETURN MAN.
[ct=342.111] AND REMEMBER, TYREEK HILL WITH
[ct=343.367] HIS EARLY DAYS WITH THE KANSAS
[ct=343.367] CITY CHIEFS.
[ct=346.038] HE DIDN’T PLAY A WHOLE LOT OF
[ct=347.387] RECEIVER, EITHER.
[ct=348.706] GOT A CHANCE, SO WHO KNOWS.
[ct=349.979] THEY’RE GOING TO TRY TO WORK
[ct=351.361] TURPIN IN A LOT MORE INTO THIS
[ct=354.033] OFFENSE.
[ct=355.759] >> Mike: AT THE PHILADELPHIA 42
[ct=356.054] YARD LINE.
[ct=359.068] PRESCOTT OUT QUICK.
[ct=361.244] IN FRONT OF THE COWBOYS’
[ct=362.577] PICKENS.
[ct=363.087] GETS TAGGED THERE.
[ct=364.714] THEY’LL MARK THE 37 YARD LINE.
[ct=366.979] FIRST THREE YEARS IN PITTSBURGH.
[ct=367.695] HIGH PRODUCTIVITY.
[ct=369.232] SOME STAR PLAYS.
[ct=371.537] ALSO CAUSED A LOT OF ATTENTION
[ct=373.266] WITH HIS ANTICS.
[ct=375.352] THE QUESTION IS HOW FOCUSED WILL
[ct=375.869] PICKENS BE?
[ct=378.079] SO FAR, CRIS, THE REPORTS HAVE
[ct=378.364] BEEN GOOD.
[ct=379.501] >> Cris: YEAH, I THINK HE SPENT
[ct=382.369] A LOT OF THYME WITH CEEDEE LAMB.
[ct=383.421] CEEDEE LAMB WAS FULL OF PRAISE
[ct=384.013] WITH PICKENS.
[ct=386.929] WHAT PICKENS DOES IS HE IS ONE
[ct=389.576] OF THE VERY BEST IN THE NFL DEEP
[ct=390.392] BALL CATCHERS.
[ct=391.995] YOU’RE GOING TO LEAVE THEM ONE
[ct=394.216] ON ONE ON THE OUTSIDE, NEAR
[ct=394.959] SIMPLY GOING TO THROW IT UP TO
[ct=399.388] HIM.
[ct=401.862] >> Mike: FROM THE 36, WILLIAMS
[ct=403.317] RUNNING UP THE MIDDLE, CLOSE TO
[ct=404.885] A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=406.264] SHY OF THE 32 YARD LINE.
[ct=407.569] JAVONTE WILLIAMS BEHIND HIS GOOD
[ct=409.788] OFFENSIVE LINE COULD BE A GOOD
[ct=410.974] EQUATION FOR DALLAS THIS YEAR.
[ct=412.076] >> Cris: THIS IS A DREAM COME
[ct=413.892] TRUE FOR THE DALLAS COWBOYS.
[ct=415.182] YOU’VE GOT JALEN CARTER OUT OF
[ct=416.230] THE GAME NOW.
[ct=417.309] THEIR ENTIRE GAME PLAN, THEY
[ct=418.623] WERE THINKING ABOUT GOING
[ct=418.894] NO-HUDDLE.
[ct=419.858] SO THEY HAD TO SUBSTITUTE HIM
[ct=421.431] OUT SO THEY COULD THROW THE
[ct=421.770] FOOTBALL.
[ct=423.638] AND SO FAR NOW, WHAT WE’VE SEEN
[ct=426.029] IN THE EARLY GOING IS JALEN
[ct=427.186] CARTER OUT OF THE GAME.
[ct=427.491] NO DOUBLE TEAM.
[ct=429.430] AND THE COWBOYS ARE DOING
[ct=430.796] EXACTLY WHAT THEY HOPED TO DO IN
[ct=431.723] THIS ONE, WHICH IS START OUT
[ct=435.710] RUNNING THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=439.737] >> Mike: NUMBER 90 WITH CARTER
[ct=441.065] EJECTED BEFORE THE FIRST SNAP OF
[ct=442.405] THE GAME.
[ct=442.405] PRESCOTT, PLAY ACTION.
[ct=444.993] ABOUT TO GET HIT.
[ct=447.721] IT’S OPEN FOR CEEDEE LAMB INSIDE
[ct=447.721] THE 5.
[ct=450.355] FIRST AND GOAL, DALLAS.
[ct=451.662] AND PRESCOTT GETS LAMB DOWN TO
[ct=458.357] THE 2.
[ct=460.949] >> Cris: WHAT A MOVE ON THE
[ct=462.296] OUTSIDE BY CEEDEE LAMB.
[ct=464.990] ALMOST NOBODY CAN SAY WITH HIM,
[ct=471.619] AND NOT ADOREE’ JACKSON.
[ct=473.036] >> Mike: PUT IS IT UP FOR LAMB.
[ct=476.952] CONTACT AND A FLAG ON JACKSON.
[ct=476.952] VETERAN IN HIS NINTH YEAR.
[ct=480.885] LAST FOUR YEARS WITH THE GIANTS.
[ct=482.234] DARIUS SLADE WAS RELEASED,
[ct=483.672] SIGNED WITH THE STEELERS.
[ct=486.357] JACKSON TAKES OVER AT CORNER.
[ct=489.086] >> Referee: PASS INTERFERENCE.
[ct=489.086] DEFENSE, NUMBER 8.
[ct=491.611] HALF THE DISTANCE PENALTY.
[ct=491.611] AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN.
[ct=494.300] >> Cris: ABSOLUTELY NO QUESTION.
[ct=498.267] SO TAKING ADVANTAGE OF BOTH OF
[ct=499.646] THE WEAKER PARTS NOW FOR THE
[ct=502.281] PHILADELPHIA EAGLES, ALONG THE
[ct=504.896] DEFENSIVE LINE WITH NO CARTER
[ct=506.216] AND GOING RIGHT AFTER ADOREE’
[ct=507.637] JACKSON IN THE SECONDARY.
[ct=508.999] WHAT A DRIVE THIS HAS BEEN SO
[ct=510.248] FAR FOR DALLAS.
[ct=511.504] >> Mike: JAVONTE WILLIAMS, THE
[ct=512.920] RUNNING BACK, FIRST AND GOAL
[ct=519.543] COWBOYS.
[ct=520.822] ONE SIDE INTO THE END ZONE FOR
[ct=528.898] THE SEASON’S FIRST TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=530.315] >> Cris: THIS IS WHERE YOU’RE
[ct=531.638] GOING TO HAVE TO WIN THE BATTLE,
[ct=532.868] RIGHT IN HERE.
[ct=534.137] AND FOR THE PHILADELPHIA EAGLES
[ct=536.892] ON THAT DRIVE, THERE WAS NOTHING
[ct=536.892] FANCY.
[ct=538.284] TYLER SMITH, HE WAS THE BEST
[ct=540.870] OFFENSIVE LINEMAN FOR THE DALLAS
[ct=542.150] SIMPLY HAD NO PROBLEM AT ALL
[ct=544.942] WITH JORDAN DAVIS.
[ct=547.469] AND TYLER GUYTON WAS ABLE TO
[ct=550.285] FINISH IT OFF WITH ZACK BAUN.
[ct=552.819] USUALLY YOU’RE SEEING THE JALEN
[ct=552.819] CARTER/ZACK BAUN COMBINATION,
[ct=554.195] BUT THAT GOES OUT THE WINDOW
[ct=554.195] NOW.
[ct=555.575] >> Mike: TWO YEARS IN THE
[ct=558.081] LEAGUE, BOTH YEARS AN ALL PRO
[ct=558.081] SEASON.
[ct=559.520] BRANDON AUBREY HAS THE FIRST
[ct=560.898] EXTRA POINT OF THE YEAR.
[ct=562.025] YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT A
[ct=563.472] STUNNING START TO THE SEASON,
[ct=566.049] BEST PLAYER ON THE PHILLY
[ct=598.048] BALL TO THE 35 YARD LINE INSTEAD
[ct=601.993] OF THE 30 YARD LINE THIS YEAR.
[ct=601.993] LET’S CHECK ON SMITH, THE
[ct=608.628] REFEREE.
[ct=611.418] >> Referee: ILLEGAL MOTION ON
[ct=614.097] THE RECEIVING TEAM, NUMBER 9.
[ct=616.710] MOVEMENT PRIOR TO THE KICK.
[ct=618.083] CORRECTION, 39, NUMBER 39.
[ct=619.316] FIVE-YARD PENALTY, FIRST DOWN.
[ct=620.767] >> Mike: SO THE EAGLES TAKE OVER
[ct=620.767] AT THE 30, AND HERE’S THEIR
[ct=626.004] >> JALEN HURTS.
[ct=627.440] >> SAQUON BARKLEY.
[ct=627.440] >> A.J. BROWN.
[ct=631.485] >> DeVONTA SMITH.
[ct=634.020] >> JAHAN DOTSON.
[ct=635.353] >> DALLAS GOEDERT.
[ct=639.461] >> JORDAN MAILATA.
[ct=640.749] >> CAM JURGENS.
[ct=647.432] >> BLAINE JOHNSON OKLAHOMA.
[ct=648.741] >> Cris: STEEN IS THE ONLY NEW
[ct=651.478] FACE REPLACING BECKONS.
[ct=652.719] JALEN HURTS, START FROM THE
[ct=653.998] THREE.
[ct=656.796] FIRST THROW IS COMPLETE.
[ct=658.102] GOEDERT AT THE SIDELINE.
[ct=660.685] A PICKUP OF ABOUT NINE OFF THE
[ct=665.959] THROW FROM THE SUPER BOWL MVP.
[ct=667.421] >> Mike: JALEN HURTS HAS PLAYED
[ct=668.793] FOR THE CHAMPIONSHIP FIVE OF THE
[ct=669.954] LAST NINE YEARS IN FOOTBALL.
[ct=671.397] THREE TIMES IN COLLEGE.
[ct=671.397] TWO OF THE LAST THREE SUPER
[ct=672.568] BOWLS.
[ct=676.754] HE’S HAD GREAT SUPER BOWLS.
[ct=679.247] >> Cris: REALLY DID.
[ct=682.039] AND THE FACT THAT HE OVERCAME
[ct=682.039] WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM IN ONE OF
[ct=683.282] THOSE NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIPS
[ct=685.943] WHEN TUA CAME IN AND THREW THE
[ct=687.324] GAME-WINNING TOUCHDOWN TO DO
[ct=688.591] WHAT HE’S DONE --
[ct=689.853] >> Mike: BARKLEY’S FIRST RUN
[ct=691.228] WILL BE A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=695.387] DRAWS THE 40, TO THE 41 YARD
[ct=698.055] LINE FOR SAQUON BARKLEY.
[ct=699.387] NINTH PLAYER IN THE HISTORY OF
[ct=700.586] THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE
[ct=700.586] WITH 2,000 YARDS LAST YEAR.
[ct=701.989] >> Cris: YEAH, RIGHT IN THE
[ct=704.690] MIDDLE OF YOUR SCREEN THERE,
[ct=704.690] KENNY CLARK.
[ct=706.065] HE’S GOING TO HAVE TO BE THE ONE
[ct=708.537] THAT STARTS TO SOLIDIFY THIS RUN
[ct=709.885] DEFENSE UP FRONT.
[ct=711.287] THE COWBOYS ARE JUST SICK AND
[ct=715.227] TIRED OF HAVING PEOPLE RUN THE
[ct=716.492] FOOTBALL, AND THEIR INABILITY TO
[ct=716.492] RUN THE BALL.
[ct=719.197] AND YET SO FAR IN THIS GAME, AT
[ct=719.197] LEAST ON OFFENSE, THEY HAVE BEEN
[ct=723.312] ABLE TO RUN IT.
[ct=728.498] >> Mike: JUST PAST THE 40.
[ct=734.006] JALEN HURTS WILL SLIDE DOWN AT
[ct=734.006] THE 48 YARD LINE.
[ct=736.731] SECOND AND 3 FOR A MAN WHO’S
[ct=739.341] VERY EFFECTIVE ON THE MOVE.
[ct=740.748] >> Cris: AND I DON’T THINK THAT
[ct=742.008] WE RECOGNIZE THE ABILITY OF
[ct=746.040] QUARTERBACKS TO MAKE PLAYS LIKE
[ct=746.040] THIS ENOUGH.
[ct=747.410] I MEAN, IF HE COMPLETES A PASS,
[ct=748.696] A BEAUTIFUL THROW, IT’S GREAT.
[ct=751.368] BUT SECOND DOWN AND SHORT IN THE
[ct=752.654] NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE IS YOUR
[ct=752.654] DREAM DOWN.
[ct=755.382] BECAUSE THE WAY THAT THESE GUYS
[ct=756.607] PLAY, WHEN THEY GET TO THIRD AND
[ct=757.986] 2, LET’S SAY, THEY COULD RUN TWO
[ct=759.380] QUARTERBACK SNEAKS AND PICK UP
[ct=760.573] THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=761.941] THEY BASICALLY HAVE A FREE DOWN
[ct=763.225] RIGHT HERE TO DO WHATEVER THEY
[ct=763.225] WANT TO DO.
[ct=765.896] >> Mike: 59 IS KENNETH MURRAY.
[ct=769.967] HE’S CALLING THE DEFENSIVE
[ct=771.355] SIGNALS.
[ct=771.355] BARKLEY ON THE MOVE.
[ct=775.334] SAQUON BARKLEY.
[ct=777.869] JERGENS -- OH -- AT THE 36 YARD
[ct=783.302] LINE, A FIRST DOWN FOR BARKLEY.
[ct=784.615] >> Cris: YOU GET ALL THESE GUYS
[ct=785.824] HERE, YOU’RE GOING TO PULL THIS
[ct=785.824] GUARD.
[ct=787.165] EVERYBODY’S GOING TO THINK THIS
[ct=788.543] AND THEY GO FLIP 90 OUT THIS
[ct=789.829] WAY.
[ct=791.164] THAT’S WHAT I’M SAYING.
[ct=792.501] THIS WAS A FREE PLAY.
[ct=795.166] THIS WAS A CHANCE TO JUST TAKE A
[ct=795.166] SHOT AT SOMETHING THAT MIGHT
[ct=799.086] POP, AND IT DID.
[ct=800.446] >> Mike: WE’LL GET INTO IT AS
[ct=801.826] THE NIGHT GOES ON.
[ct=804.426] THIS EAGLES TEAM, BARKLEY, THE
[ct=804.426] 2,000 YARDS.
[ct=807.160] HURTS, THE SUPER BOWL SUCCESS.
[ct=808.399] IT STARTS UP FRONT.
[ct=811.096] AND THEY ARE AS GOOD A UNIT AS
[ct=812.493] THERE IS IN THE LEAGUE.
[ct=816.327] WILL SHIPLEY IS NOW THE BACK.
[ct=820.416] OVER THE MIDDLE FOR GOEDERT.
[ct=821.698] AT THE 30, PUNCHING OF THE BALL.
[ct=824.382] THE COWBOY LINEBACKER JOINS
[ct=825.776] MALIK HOOKER ON THE TACKLE.
[ct=826.981] >> Cris: AND MIKE, FOR THE
[ct=829.779] DALLAS COWBOYS, THEY’RE PLAYING
[ct=829.779] JALEN HURTS AND THIS TREMENDOUS
[ct=832.320] OFFENSE AND GREAT OFFENSIVE
[ct=832.320] LINE.
[ct=833.716] BUT YOUR OFFENSE JUST DID IT,
[ct=834.949] RIGHT?
[ct=834.949] THE COWBOYS OFFENSE TOOK IT
[ct=837.762] RIGHT DOWN THE FIELD AND SCORED
[ct=837.762] A TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=840.269] YOU GOT TO ANSWER THAT EFFORT ON
[ct=840.269] DEFENSE.
[ct=841.721] YOU GOT TO COME BACK AND MAKE A
[ct=843.100] STOP.
[ct=843.100] HOLD THEM TO AT LEAST A FIELD
[ct=846.924] GOAL HERE.
[ct=849.674] >> Mike: THE 30 YARD LINE,
[ct=850.988] QUICKLY TO THE RIGHT SIDE AND A
[ct=853.673] FIRST DOWN FOR WILL SHIPLEY, THE
[ct=854.873] SECOND-YEAR BACK OUT OF CLEMSON
[ct=857.610] WITH THE BACK END OF A BLOWOUT
[ct=858.854] NFC CHAMPIONSHIP GAME WIN OVER
[ct=861.658] WASHINGTON ARE HAD A COUPLE OF
[ct=862.962] REALLY NICE RUNS.
[ct=864.153] >> Cris: I DON’T KNOW WHAT YOU
[ct=865.599] DO WHEN THE PHILADELPHIA EAGLES
[ct=868.216] GET OFF THE BUS, EVERYBODY
[ct=870.831] EXCEPT DeVONTA SMITH, I MEAN, IT
[ct=872.282] JUST LOOKS LIKE BIG-TIME
[ct=873.500] WRESTLING OR SOMETHING COMING
[ct=874.890] OFF THE BUS.
[ct=877.521] THEY ARE JUST BIG AND TALL.
[ct=880.264] >> Mike: SHIPLEY, RECEIVERS
[ct=880.264] BLOCKING.
[ct=882.780] SHIPLEY INSIDE THE 10.
[ct=885.512] FIRST AND GOAL, PHILADELPHIA AT
[ct=885.512] THE 6.
[ct=889.459] SO THE SECOND-YEAR MAN, WILL
[ct=890.826] SHIPLEY, WILL FORM PART OF THE
[ct=894.729] >> Cris: AND WE ARE SEEING
[ct=896.154] BLOCKING OUT OF EVERYBODY ON THE
[ct=896.154] OUTSIDE.
[ct=897.539] THE PHILADELPHIA EAGLES HAVE
[ct=898.744] REALLY COME TOGETHER AS A TEAM.
[ct=900.168] WATCH DeVONTA SMITH.
[ct=905.469] ALL 170 POUNDS OF HIM ON THE
[ct=908.140] DOING A JOB FOR HIS TEAMMATES.
[ct=909.411] HE’S THE ONLY GUY THAT WHEN YOU
[ct=912.045] LOOK AT HIM YOU GO, THERE’S ONLY
[ct=913.304] ONE GUY THAT’S UNBLOCKED UPFIELD
[ct=914.742] BY NOW.
[ct=917.294] THEY’RE ALL SO BIG, YET HERE HE
[ct=920.099] IS CONSTANTLY MAKING PLAYS JUST
[ct=920.099] LIKE THAT.
[ct=924.003] >> Mike: FIRST AND GOAL, PHILLY.
[ct=926.657] LEFT SIDE, SAQUON.
[ct=928.046] BROUGHT TOWN NEAR THE 3.
[ct=929.269] SECOND AND GOAL.
[ct=932.039] CLOSING IN ON THAT AREA WHERE
[ct=932.039] PHILLY’S SO EFFECTIVE.
[ct=936.047] POWER RUNNING INSIDE THE 5.
[ct=937.188] >> Cris: AND NOW IT’S JUST A
[ct=938.628] MATTER OF WHAT NICK SIRIANNI
[ct=941.301] WANTS TO DO.
[ct=942.537] I MEAN, THEORETICALLY, HE COULD
[ct=944.011] TAKE HIS QUARTERBACK AND JUST
[ct=945.302] RUN THREE OF THOSE PLAYS THERE.
[ct=946.527] BUT I WOULD THINK THEY WOULD NOT
[ct=949.193] WANT TO RUN HIM QUITE AS MUCH
[ct=951.974] UNTIL IT WAS 100% NEEDED.
[ct=954.487] YOU’VE GOT SAQUON BARKLEY RIGHT
[ct=962.663] BEHIND HIM, REALLY NO NEED.
[ct=966.598] >> Mike: HERE WE GO.
[ct=970.631] THE COWBOYS SURGE.
[ct=971.980] THOMAS, LAST THREE YEARS WITH
[ct=973.146] THE JETS.
[ct=974.595] PLAYED FOR SAN FRANCISCO AND THE
[ct=975.937] RAIDERS THERE AS WELL IN THERE
[ct=977.263] ON THE STOP.
[ct=978.474] >> Cris: KENNETH MURRAY IN THERE
[ct=979.927] AS WELL.
[ct=979.927] ONE OF THE THINGS THEY HAVE TO
[ct=981.228] DO WITH KENNETH MURRAY NOW IS
[ct=982.617] MORE OF A SPEED LINEBACKER, IS
[ct=985.133] EXACTLY WHAT HE DID THERE.
[ct=986.540] GET THROUGH THE INITIAL LINE OF
[ct=986.540] SCRIMMAGE.
[ct=990.465] IT’S NOT HIS JOB TO TAKE ON
[ct=991.846] 330-POUND OFFENSIVE LINEMEN.
[ct=994.523] HE’S GOT TO USE HIS SPEED TO GET
[ct=997.087] >> Mike: YOUR RECEIVERS TO THE
[ct=998.508] TOP.
[ct=1005.137] THE MOTION MAN IS JAHAN DOTSON.
[ct=1005.137] THIRD AND GOAL.
[ct=1006.482] HURTS HAS TIME.
[ct=1007.763] JALEN HURTS, TOUCHDOWN
[ct=1023.719] PHILADELPHIA.
[ct=1025.059] >> Cris: THE BIGGEST JOB FOR ANY
[ct=1026.261] QUARTERBACK IN THE NFL, TO
[ct=1027.696] CONVERT ON THIRD DOWN AND
[ct=1029.068] CONVERT IN THE RED ZONE.
[ct=1030.414] PASS?
[ct=1030.414] GREAT.
[ct=1032.960] ZONE?
[ct=1034.374] THIS GUY IS TREMENDOUS AT DOING
[ct=1042.366] BOTH.
[ct=1043.644] >> Mike: PASS RUSH HANDLED SANS
[ct=1046.359] PARSONS.
[ct=1047.585] PERCH TO THE END ZONE.
[ct=1049.012] NOW JAKE ELLIOTT.
[ct=1055.587] TWO DRIVES, TWO TOUCHDOWNS.
[ct=1058.228] SEPTEMBER 22nd ON NBC AND
[ct=1058.228] PEACOCK.
[ct=1060.953] PHILLY’S DONE A GREAT JOB
[ct=1063.476] GETTING READY FOR THIS OPENING
[ct=1064.879] NIGHT.
[ct=1066.143] CENTER CITY HAS BEEN ALL LIT UP
[ct=1066.143] IN GREEN.
[ct=1067.613] FOUR MILES DOWN BROAD STREET
[ct=1068.801] HERE IN SOUTH PHILLY.
[ct=1075.450] THE LINK AS WELL.
[ct=1078.118] TIED AT 7.
[ct=1080.766] GET AWAY FROM HIM, BUT HE CAN’T,
[ct=1083.505] AND IT’S TAKEN BY TURPIN.
[ct=1084.904] A RETURN WILL STOP HIM AT ABOUT
[ct=1084.904] THE 23 YARD LINE.
[ct=1087.417] AND MELISSA, THAT’S WHERE DAK
[ct=1091.442] PRESCOTT AND THE COWBOYS OFF
[ct=1092.711] WANTS TO FIST PUMP.
[ct=1094.103] THE HELMET OFF.
[ct=1096.755] FLAGS EVERYWHERE.
[ct=1099.369] WELCOME BACK TO COWBOYS/EAGLES.
[ct=1102.056] WE’VE GOT FOUR DIFFERENT FLAGS
[ct=1119.369] THROWN AFTER THE SCRUM.
[ct=1124.617] >> Cris: IT WAS HARD TO TELL
[ct=1128.617] WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM FIRST.
[ct=1129.896] >> Mike: AGAIN, A LOT OF
[ct=1132.686] TONE-SETTING WITH THESE TEAMS.
[ct=1134.009] TWO BLOW-OUT WINS WITH PRESCOTT
[ct=1135.216] MISSING BOTH GAMES FOR DALLAS
[ct=1144.514] LAST YEAR.
[ct=1147.213] >> Cris: COOPER TO JEAN LOOKED
[ct=1148.482] LIKE HE WAS THE ONE WHO GRABBED
[ct=1149.892] THE FACE MASK.
[ct=1152.452] CAN’T TELL IF HE WAS THE ONE WHO
[ct=1155.180] ACTUALLY TOOK IT OFF.
[ct=1159.114] IT WAS LIUFAU TRYING TO DO THE
[ct=1160.519] SAME BACK TO HIM.
[ct=1161.880] >> Referee: TWO PERSONAL FOULS
[ct=1165.780] ON THE PLAY.
[ct=1169.849] NUMBER 35 AND NUMBER 14.
[ct=1172.354] HALF THE DISTANCE PENALTIES.
[ct=1172.354] FIRST DOWN.
[ct=1173.810] >> Mike: SO IT WILL TAKE DALLAS
[ct=1175.173] BACK DEEP IN THEIR OWN
[ct=1177.721] TERRITORY.
[ct=1180.393] VERY OFTEN, AS IT’S TIGHT IN
[ct=1181.766] THERE, SECOND ONE IS THE ONE
[ct=1185.772] THAT GETS CAUGHT.
[ct=1188.343] >> Cris: DALLAS/PHI
[ct=1189.629] GO.
[ct=1191.123] THIS IS EXACTLY WHEN WE’VE BEEN
[ct=1191.123] TALKING ABOUT THIS ALL WEEK.
[ct=1192.285] THE SHOT THAT THE DALLAS COWBOYS
[ct=1194.927] HAD WAS THAT THIS OFFENSE REALLY
[ct=1196.388] WAS SORT OF PUT TOGETHER AND
[ct=1197.755] THAT THEY WERE GOING TO BE ABLE
[ct=1199.027] TO RUN THE FOOTBALL ENOUGH TO
[ct=1200.375] SET UP THEIR PASSING GAME, WHICH
[ct=1201.609] IS WHAT THEY DID ON THAT FIRST
[ct=1202.908] DRIVE, HITTING THAT BIG PASS TO
[ct=1205.642] CEEDEE LAMB DOWN INSIDE THE 5.
[ct=1208.336] NOW CAN THEY CONTINUE WITH THE
[ct=1209.700] RUN GAME?
[ct=1212.292] THAT’S THE MOST IMPORTANT
[ct=1212.292] QUESTION.
[ct=1214.962] IT’S BEEN MADE A LOT EASIER WITH
[ct=1216.196] JALEN.
[ct=1218.824] >> Mike: NUMBER 12, WILLIAMS
[ct=1218.824] GOES LEFT.
[ct=1220.261] MELISSA ON DECK.
[ct=1221.674] >> Melissa: YES, DAK PRESCOTT
[ct=1224.305] MISSED THE FINAL NINE GAMES OF
[ct=1225.526] LAST SEASON AFTER SUFFERING A
[ct=1230.824] RIGHT HAMSTRING INJURY.
[ct=1232.243] AN INJURY THAT REQUIRED SURGERY
[ct=1234.895] IN NOVEMBER OF LAST YEAR WHERE
[ct=1240.204] HE HAD THREE SCREWS INSERTED TO
[ct=1240.204] STABILIZE.
[ct=1244.089] DAK TELLS US REHAB WAS TOUGH.
[ct=1246.831] NOW HE SAYS HE’S TOTALLY
[ct=1248.193] CONFIDENT, SAYING MOBILITY WILL
[ct=1248.193] NOT BE AFFECTED.
[ct=1249.374] >> Mike: WE WENT DOWN TO DALLAS
[ct=1252.127] AS YOU ALLUDED TO EARLIER ON
[ct=1253.434] MONDAY.
[ct=1253.434] DAK WALKED IN THE MEETING ROOM,
[ct=1254.723] LOOKED GREAT.
[ct=1254.723] LOOKED GREAT IN PRACTICE AS
[ct=1258.751] WELL.
[ct=1260.104] HERE TRYING TO FIND SOME SPACE.
[ct=1261.323] PROTECTED THE BALL AND THREW IT
[ct=1266.761] COMPLETE TO CEEDEE LAMB.
[ct=1269.319] DAK KEPT IT ALIVE, AND LAMB HAS
[ct=1272.073] >> Cris: THIS IS WHAT DAK SIMPLY
[ct=1273.292] COULD NOT OR DID NOT DO
[ct=1276.053] SUCCESSFULLY A SEASON AGO.
[ct=1277.374] SCRAMBLED TO THE RIGHT, ALL THE
[ct=1278.643] WAY BACK LEFT.
[ct=1281.353] GET OUT, TURN HIS BODY, AND
[ct=1284.009] WATCH CEEDEE COME BACK INSIDE
[ct=1285.271] THE QUARTERBACK TO MAKE THAT
[ct=1285.271] CATCH.
[ct=1289.247] HE HAD TO TAKE HIS HANDS OFF THE
[ct=1290.647] BALL, PRESCOTT DID, AND STILL
[ct=1290.647] ABLE TO COMPLETE IT.
[ct=1293.262] WHAT A START FOR THIS FALCONS
[ct=1294.636] >> Mike: JORDAN DAVIS OUT OF THE
[ct=1297.199] LINEUP FOR THE MOMENT FOR THE
[ct=1297.199] EAGLES.
[ct=1298.660] THEIR TWO BIG TACKLES ARE NOT
[ct=1300.001] THERE IN THE MIDDLE.
[ct=1301.339] DEVONTA WILLIAMS TAKES ADVANTAGE
[ct=1303.940] OF THAT.
[ct=1309.189] FIVE YARDS TO THE 38 YARD LINE.
[ct=1311.972] >> Cris: JAVONTE WILLIAMS WAS
[ct=1318.495] ACTUALLY CRABBED BY BANOS, THE
[ct=1319.942] COORDINATOR OF THE PHILADELPHIA
[ct=1321.170] WE GOT TO WATCH SOME TAPE FROM
[ct=1323.928] HIS ROOKIE YEAR IN 2021.
[ct=1326.554] HE’S MADE SOME OF THE MOST
[ct=1327.896] SPECTACULAR PLAYS WE SAW THAT
[ct=1330.548] IF HE’S ANYWHERE CLOSE BACK TO
[ct=1331.914] THAT FORM, HE’S REALLY GOING TO
[ct=1331.914] BE OF VALUE FOR THE DALLAS
[ct=1338.524] >> Mike: HE’LL GO TO THE LEFT
[ct=1341.037] HERE.
[ct=1346.482] A GAIN OF THREE, 1 YARD LINE.
[ct=1349.153] YEP, COOPER, CAMPBELL, THE
[ct=1350.484] TACKLES.
[ct=1351.844] MORE PUSHING AND SHOVING AFTER
[ct=1351.844] THE PLAY.
[ct=1354.479] NOW BEING SEPARATED.
[ct=1355.770] JAVONTE WILLIAMS, HAD HIM WHEN
[ct=1358.395] HE WAS THE HEAD COACH IN DENVER.
[ct=1359.669] AS A DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR HERE
[ct=1361.098] IN PHILLY.
[ct=1363.784] >> Cris: YEAH, HE WAS TALKING
[ct=1365.013] ABOUT HOW SPECIAL HE WAS THAT
[ct=1368.991] FIRST YEAR BEFORE HE HURT HIS
[ct=1368.991] KNEE.
[ct=1371.680] MIKE, WE HAVE SEEN EVERY SINGLE
[ct=1373.018] PASS, I THINK -- CEEDEE AND
[ct=1375.558] GEORGE PICKENS ON OPPOSITE SIDES
[ct=1375.558] OF THE FIELD, TRYING TO STRETCH
[ct=1379.659] THAT DEFENSE.
[ct=1380.881] >> Mike: TIGHT FORMATION HERE ON
[ct=1380.881] THIRD AND 2.
[ct=1383.664] PRESCOTT SCANNING.
[ct=1387.581] AND THROWS COMPLETE TO LAMB,
[ct=1388.873] ACROSS THE FIELD AS CEEDEE LAMB
[ct=1391.577] TAKES IT RIGHT AROUND THE 30
[ct=1392.915] EFFECTIVE START FOR CEEDEE LAMB
[ct=1395.608] HERE IN THE OPENER.
[ct=1396.936] >> Cris: BIG QUESTIONS COMING
[ct=1399.458] INTO THIS ONE WAS WHETHER OR NOT
[ct=1403.547] TYLER HOOKER RIGHT HERE WAS
[ct=1404.846] GOING TO BE ABLE TO HOLD UP
[ct=1406.133] AGAINST JALEN CARTER.
[ct=1407.602] WELL, GUESS WHAT, THIS NEVER
[ct=1408.864] REALLY HAPPENED IN THIS GAME.
[ct=1410.171] SO, HUGE ADVANTAGE TO THE DALLAS
[ct=1412.808] COWBOYS, BREAKING IN THEIR NEW
[ct=1414.132] CORNER.
[ct=1414.132] >> Mike: 26 OF THOSE 76 YARDS ON
[ct=1431.435] THE LAST CATCH.
[ct=1432.768] MILES SANDERS THE BACK.
[ct=1432.768] OFF IN TIME.
[ct=1434.053] A DIFFERENT FLAG DOWN AS THE
[ct=1435.395] PASS IS COMPLETE TO THE 30 YARD
[ct=1442.026] PENN STATE.
[ct=1443.333] >> Referee: HOLDING.
[ct=1444.736] OFFENSE, NUMBER 73.
[ct=1447.347] 10-YARD PENALTY.
[ct=1448.615] >> Cris: NO PROBLEM CALLING THAT
[ct=1449.988] ONE.
[ct=1449.988] THAT WAS PRETTY EASY RIGHT
[ct=1451.367] TYLER SMITH GOT BEAT RIGHT OFF
[ct=1452.702] THE BALL.
[ct=1453.931] AND AS SOON AS IT HAPPENED, HE
[ct=1456.620] KNEW IT WAS OVER FOR HIM, AND HE
[ct=1457.979] SIMPLY JUST FADED BACK.
[ct=1457.979] AND IT WAS A GOOD DECISION FOR
[ct=1463.354] >> Mike: GOT A HAND ON BYRON
[ct=1471.284] YOUNG.
[ct=1471.284] SMITH.
[ct=1472.550] SEE WHERE HE WAS.
[ct=1475.313] I BELIEVE THAT TACKLE EARLY ON,
[ct=1476.522] MOVED INSIDE THE GUARD.
[ct=1477.856] HE’LL STAY THERE NOW.
[ct=1480.502] A REALLY SOLID PLAYER INSIDE.
[ct=1481.868] FINAL TWO MINUTES OF THIS
[ct=1485.934] OPENING QUARTER.
[ct=1487.286] PRESCOTT HAS TO GET IT BACK,
[ct=1488.518] SANDERS HAS IT.
[ct=1489.897] AND THE OPEN FIELD.
[ct=1489.897] BRINGS THEM DOWN.
[ct=1493.795] LOSS OF THREE.
[ct=1495.128] ZACK BAUN, THE SPECIAL TEAMER.
[ct=1497.833] HE WENT ALL PRO LINEBACKER LAST
[ct=1497.833] YEAR.
[ct=1499.198] >> Cris: ONE OF THE THINGS THAT
[ct=1501.761] ZACK BAUN DOES ABSOLUTELY BEST
[ct=1503.157] IS BRING DOWN PEOPLE IN THE OPEN
[ct=1503.157] FIELD.
[ct=1507.065] A REMARKABLE STORY.
[ct=1508.386] HE WAS NEVER AN OFF THE BALL
[ct=1508.386] LINEBACKER.
[ct=1509.804] HE PLAYED ON THE EDGE AND RUSHED
[ct=1512.452] THE PASSER FOR THE NEW ORLEANS
[ct=1515.066] SAINTS FOR MULTIPLE YEARS.
[ct=1516.423] COMES HERE, THEY TRY HIM AT
[ct=1517.807] INSIDE LINEBACKER, AND HE’S THE
[ct=1519.052] BEST IN FOOTBALL IN HIS FIRST
[ct=1523.101] NOW HE’S WORKING IT BEHIND JALEN
[ct=1524.452] CARTER, WOULD CERTAINLY HELP,
[ct=1529.719] BUT JUST A REMARKABLE STORY.
[ct=1530.999] >> Mike: TURPIN IN MOTION.
[ct=1530.999] SECOND AND 23.
[ct=1533.717] PRESCOTT TAKING THE SHOT.
[ct=1535.067] PICKENS ON THE SIDELINE TRYING
[ct=1537.657] TO COME UP WITH THE ONE-HAND
[ct=1537.657] GRAB, COULD NOT.
[ct=1540.272] WORKING ON MITCHELL, WHO HAD HIS
[ct=1541.619] LEFT ARM PINCHED.
[ct=1546.910] THE FLAG IS THROWN BY THE BACK
[ct=1546.910] JUDGE.
[ct=1549.584] DEFENSE, NUMBER 27.
[ct=1552.247] THE BALL WILL BE PLACED AT THE
[ct=1553.606] SPOT OF THE FOUL.
[ct=1554.875] >> Mike: AND THAT’S WHAT PICKENS
[ct=1557.625] DOES BEST, CONTESTED CATCHES.
[ct=1557.625] >> Cris: JUST GOT DALLAS OUT OF
[ct=1560.293] A HUGE HOLE WITH THAT.
[ct=1562.883] AND YOU CAN SEE THAT MITCHELL
[ct=1565.567] HAS HIS HAND INSIDE THE FRONT OF
[ct=1568.294] THE JERSEY RIGHT THERE.
[ct=1570.941] AND PICKENS JUST COULDN’T GET
[ct=1574.845] TRIED TO MAKE THE CATCH.
[ct=1576.144] SIRIANNI WANTS NO PART OF IT.
[ct=1577.588] THAT WAS A HUGE PLAY BECAUSE OF
[ct=1578.886] THE WAY THE COWBOYS ARE BACKED
[ct=1580.142] UP.
[ct=1584.190] >> Mike: 34-YARD PENALTY.
[ct=1584.190] FROM THE 12, PRESCOTT, PLAY
[ct=1588.196] ACTION.
[ct=1592.114] BACK OF THE END ZONE.
[ct=1593.373] MITCHELL.
[ct=1593.373] BALL ACROSS THE DEFENSE TO MAKE
[ct=1598.715] HAD LAST YEAR.
[ct=1598.715] >> Cris: YEAH.
[ct=1600.170] DAK IS GOING FOR THE JUGULAR ON
[ct=1602.766] THAT ONE.
[ct=1605.381] SHOULD HAVE JUST TAKEN THE QUICK
[ct=1605.381] ONE RIGHT HERE.
[ct=1608.159] SOMETIMES WHEN YOU GET IT GOING
[ct=1609.391] AND YOU HIT SOME OF THOSE BIG
[ct=1610.731] PLAYS DOWN THE FIELD, THIS IS A
[ct=1610.731] FIRST DOWN THROW.
[ct=1613.339] JUST TAKE ONE, TAKE A LITTLE
[ct=1614.676] GAIN.
[ct=1616.016] COMPLETELY COVERED ON THE BACK
[ct=1617.357] CLIMB TO THE END ZONE.
[ct=1618.728] >> Mike: FIRST INCOMPLETION OF
[ct=1630.634] THE NIGHT FOR PRESCOTT.
[ct=1633.276] WILLIAMS POWERING FORWARD TO THE
[ct=1633.276] 2.
[ct=1636.022] INSIDE THE 2, AND IT’S FIRST AND
[ct=1636.022] GOAL FOR THE COWBOYS HERE AT THE
[ct=1642.635] BACK END OF THIS FIRST QUARTER.
[ct=1644.023] POWER RUNNING HERE.
[ct=1645.211] COWBOYS GET ON THE BALL.
[ct=1662.455] DON’T HAVE TO RUN A PLAY.
[ct=1665.104] LIKE THEY’LL JUST PLAY IT OUT,
[ct=1665.104] AND THIS FIRST QUARTER WILL COME
[ct=1670.444] TO AN END.
[ct=1674.530] TWO FULL DRIVES.HAMPION
[ct=1674.530] EAGLES, HERE IN THE SPORTS
[ct=1675.763] COMPLEX IN SOUTH PHILLY.
[ct=1679.790] SECOND QUARTER BEGINS WITH THE
[ct=1681.053] COWBOYS KNOCKING ON THE DOOR.
[ct=1683.802] FIRST AND GOAL FROM THE 1.
[ct=1683.802] DEVONTA WILLIAMS, THE RUNNING
[ct=1691.718] BACK.
[ct=1697.103] >> WILLIAMS, INSIDE FOR THE
[ct=1697.103] TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=1698.358] TWO DRIVES TO JAVONTE WILLIAMS.
[ct=1699.667] ONE-YARD TOUCHDOWN RUNS.
[ct=1700.978] AND DALLAS LEADS 13-7.
[ct=1702.438] >> Cris: YOU KNOW, MIKE, I THINK
[ct=1704.964] WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING
[ct=1707.618] AND THE DALLAS COWBOYS,
[ct=1708.941] CERTAINLY RUNNING THE FOOTBALL
[ct=1710.380] AND DOING WELL.
[ct=1711.623] BUT REMEMBER, HOW MANY PLAYERS
[ct=1713.029] NOW, THE PHILADELPHIA EAGLES ARE
[ct=1714.386] MISSING ON THIS DEFENSE.
[ct=1715.655] JOSH SWEAT, WHO LED THEM IN
[ct=1716.931] SACKS.
[ct=1719.579] MILTON WILLIAMS, WHO SIGNED $104
[ct=1721.041] MILLION CONTRACT WITH NEW
[ct=1723.568] ENGLAND.
[ct=1727.576] THAT KOBE DEAN STILL OUT.
[ct=1728.981] DARIUS SLATE.
[ct=1728.981] BRANDON GRAHAM.
[ct=1730.157] THAT’S A LOT OF PEOPLE ON THE
[ct=1731.621] DEFENSE, AND IT’S SHOWING UP
[ct=1732.978] RIGHT NOW.
[ct=1735.503] THE EAGLES DELIVERED.
[ct=1736.829] SO DID THEIR FANS.
[ct=1738.181] THE PARADE ON VALENTINE’S DAY TO
[ct=1742.133] CELEBRATE THE TITLE.
[ct=1743.500] LURIE, THE TERRIFIC OWNER OF THE
[ct=1746.199] A QUARTER CENTURY IN THIS
[ct=1746.199] ORGANIZATION.
[ct=1748.908] WHAT A TERRIFIC JOB HE HAS DONE
[ct=1750.135] WITH PERSONNEL AND NICK SIRIANNI
[ct=1751.542] AND OTHER HIRES FOR THIS TEAM
[ct=1754.075] WHAT HAS WORKED OUT.
[ct=1755.528] AUBREY.
[ct=1756.888] SECOND TOUCHBACK.
[ct=1760.812] THIS TIME, PHILLY WILL GET IT AT
[ct=1760.812] THE 35 YARD LINE.
[ct=1763.475] THE RULE ADJUSTMENT FROM LAST
[ct=1764.861] YEAR WHEN IT CAME OUT TO THE 30.
[ct=1766.054] >> Cris: YEAH, I GET THE FEELING
[ct=1768.776] THAT AUBREY’S JUST MISSED THOSE
[ct=1770.107] TWO KICKS, DON’T YOU?
[ct=1771.404] IT LOOKED LIKE HE WAS TRYING TO
[ct=1772.827] BOUNCE THEM INTO THE FIELD OF
[ct=1774.100] PLAY IN THE CORNER, AND HE JUST
[ct=1775.463] WAS -- TOO MUCH ADRENALINE ON
[ct=1775.463] BOTH OF THEM.
[ct=1778.069] >> Mike: AND A LOT OF THE
[ct=1779.336] KICKERS AROUND THE LEAGUE HAVE
[ct=1782.084] TALKED ABOUT KICKING -- A DIRTY
[ct=1783.325] KICK, A DIRTY BALL THE SPECIAL
[ct=1784.772] TEAMS GUYS ARE TALKING ABOUT.
[ct=1786.080] WHAT YOU CAN GET ROLLING ON THE
[ct=1787.420] FIELD INSIDE THE LANDING AREA
[ct=1792.719] AND SLOW DOWN THE RETURN MAN.
[ct=1797.952] DRIVE TWO FOR HURTS.
[ct=1799.334] BARKLEY, A BOUNCE AND A MOVE
[ct=1800.630] ACROSS THE 40 TO THE 41 YARD
[ct=1807.248] >> Cris: I TELL YOU, HOW MANY
[ct=1809.945] GAMES LAST YEAR DID WE DO WITH
[ct=1813.873] IT FELT LIKE HE WAS RUNNING FOR
[ct=1815.200] 70 YARDS EVERY OTHER PLAY.
[ct=1816.554] IT WAS REMARKABLE THE
[ct=1817.956] PERFORMANCE HE HAD IN L.A.,
[ct=1817.956] FIRST OF ALL.
[ct=1819.197] >> Mike: RIGHT.
[ct=1820.638] >> Cris: THE ONE RIGHT BACK HERE
[ct=1821.896] IN THE PLAYOFF GAME IN THE SNOW.
[ct=1821.896] JUST DOMINATED.
[ct=1824.551] REALLY PROBABLY WOULD HAVE HELD
[ct=1825.844] THE NFL RECORD HAD HE BEEN ABLE
[ct=1827.299] TO PLAY IN THAT LAST GAME.
[ct=1828.471] THERE’S TREVON DIGGS IN THE GAME
[ct=1831.172] NOW FOR THE DALLAS COWBOYS.
[ct=1832.568] >> Mike: LAST COUPLE OF YEARS,
[ct=1832.568] KNEE ISSUES.
[ct=1833.825] NO ACTION IN THE PRESEASON.
[ct=1841.805] BUT IN THE LINEUP HERE ONE SNAP
[ct=1843.164] ON THE OPENING DRIVE.
[ct=1844.407] OUT IN THE FIELD.
[ct=1844.407] DeVONTA SMITH.
[ct=1845.812] DOWNED BY KENNETH MURRAY.
[ct=1848.499] THE LINEBACKER OUT IN COVERAGE.
[ct=1849.721] THE PHILADELPHIA FIRST DOWN.
[ct=1851.144] >> Cris: AND LET’S TALK A LITTLE
[ct=1852.475] ABOUT THE SECONDARY FOR THE
[ct=1853.805] DALLAS COWBOYS.
[ct=1855.158] DIGGS COMING OFF THE KNEE
[ct=1855.158] INJURIES.
[ct=1857.742] AND OF COURSE, HE WAS JUST
[ct=1859.111] REMARKABLE BACK IN ’21 WHEN HE
[ct=1861.690] HAD THOSE 11 INTERCEPTIONS.
[ct=1863.046] RON BLAND HAD THE STRESS
[ct=1865.728] FRACTURE IN HIS FOOT LAST YEAR.
[ct=1868.299] THEY GOT ELAM, FIRST-ROUND PICK
[ct=1869.754] OUT OF FLORIDA.
[ct=1871.023] HE BASICALLY WAS A FAIL IN
[ct=1871.023] BUFFALO.
[ct=1872.377] NOW HE’S THE STARTING CORNER OUT
[ct=1873.666] HERE TO GET THE EAGLES ON
[ct=1876.390] OPENING NIGHT.
[ct=1880.323] >> Mike: A.J. BROWN RIGHT NOW.
[ct=1886.965] 46.
[ct=1890.892] FIVE YARDS.
[ct=1898.927] QUICK MOVES.
[ct=1901.603] >> Cris: ODIGHIZUWA DID HIS JOB
[ct=1902.930] TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THAT PLAY AND
[ct=1905.572] JUST WALL IT OFF.
[ct=1908.255] AND THE FACT THAT SAQUON SOMEHOW
[ct=1910.821] ESCAPED THAT MESS, AND REALLY
[ct=1912.250] BLAME’S GOING TO GO ON DANTE
[ct=1913.580] FOWLER FOR THAT.
[ct=1914.846] HE HAD TO CLEAN THAT UP AND KEEP
[ct=1921.551] THAT CONTAINMENT ON THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=1922.794] >> Mike: COWBOY 49.
[ct=1934.663] HURTS.
[ct=1938.768] TIGHT END DALLAS GODERT.
[ct=1938.768] HE PLAYED 10.
[ct=1940.062] WHEN HEALTHY, STILL A PLAYER WHO
[ct=1941.401] WILL BE PART OF THIS PHILLY
[ct=1942.790] OFFENSE THIS SEASON.
[ct=1946.705] >> Cris: THE EAGLES ON OFFENSE
[ct=1946.705] ARE LIKE GOOD BOXING.
[ct=1949.384] IT’S LIKE THEY JUST JAB, JAB,
[ct=1952.067] JAB, HIT YOU IN THE BELLY A
[ct=1953.311] COUPLE TIMES, JAB, JAB.
[ct=1954.733] ALL OF A SUDDEN, YOU START
[ct=1956.094] CREEPING IN AND TRYING TO MAKE
[ct=1957.312] PLAYS AND STOP SAQUON.
[ct=1960.077] THEN ONE OF THESE TWO WIDE
[ct=1961.283] RECEIVERS -- SMITH, BROWN --
[ct=1962.694] THEY GET THE ONE ON ONE THEY
[ct=1962.694] WANT.
[ct=1963.966] AND THIS USUALLY DOES NOT GO
[ct=1969.252] WELL FOR THE OPPONENTS.
[ct=1970.603] >> Mike: THIRD AND 3.
[ct=1973.261] HURTS COMES BACK TO THE MIDDLE.
[ct=1975.952] GETTING HIT IN THE MIDDLE.
[ct=1982.570] HELD ON TO BY GOEDERT
[ct=1982.570] BACK-TO-BACK TRIPS.
[ct=1985.270] NEW PLAY CALLER FOR THE EAGLES,
[ct=1989.268] KEVIN PATULLO, BEEN WITH NICK
[ct=1991.883] SIRIANNI FOR A WHILE, CRIS.
[ct=1993.226] >> Cris: KELLEN MOORE WAS HERE
[ct=1994.494] AND OF COURSE DID SUCH A GREAT
[ct=1995.957] JOB.
[ct=1997.265] BUT IT REALLY WAS THOSE THREE
[ct=1998.597] THAT REALLY CREATED THE OFFENSE
[ct=2001.189] FOR THE PHILADELPHIA EAGLES AND
[ct=2003.810] THAT CHAMPIONSHIP RUN.
[ct=2005.191] AND NOW THEY’RE THOSE TWO.
[ct=2005.191] FOR THE FIRST TIME, AT LEAST
[ct=2011.809] WITH THE EAGLES, PATULLO IS
[ct=2013.104] CALLING PLAYS.
[ct=2013.104] >> Mike: FROM THE 39, HURTS OUT
[ct=2014.504] OF THE POCKET.
[ct=2019.771] COUPLE OF YARDS.
[ct=2022.512] KYLING GRANT SON IS THE NEW
[ct=2022.512] TIGHT END IN PHILLY.
[ct=2025.118] HE WAS WITH THE COLTS BEFORE.
[ct=2026.487] SIGNS AS A FREE AGENT WITH
[ct=2026.487] PHILLY THIS YEAR.
[ct=2029.127] >> Cris: DOES IT LOOK LIKE JALEN
[ct=2029.127] HURTS IS EVEN MORE CALM THAN HE
[ct=2031.701] WAS IN THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS?
[ct=2033.027] WHICH IS HARD TO DO.
[ct=2034.430] >> Mike: HE’S ALWAYS CALM,
[ct=2035.713] ALWAYS.
[ct=2035.713] >> Cris: YES.
[ct=2036.991] HERE’S A GUY THAT REALLY SEEKS
[ct=2039.707] OUT ADVICE FROM
[ct=2041.051] CHAMPIONSHIP-TYPE PEOPLE.
[ct=2042.431] PEYTON MANNING CERTAINLY TOPS
[ct=2043.661] TIME.
[ct=2043.661] DEREK JETER.
[ct=2045.070] TOM BRADY.
[ct=2046.427] GUYS THAT HAVE WON
[ct=2047.583] CHAMPIONSHIPS.
[ct=2050.398] AND NOW HE’S ONLY INTERESTED IN
[ct=2050.398] WINNING AGAIN.
[ct=2055.634] HE MADE THAT VERY CLEAR.
[ct=2060.945] >> Mike: SECOND AND 9.
[ct=2062.301] HURTS FINDS SOME TIME AND HAS A
[ct=2064.931] LOT OF SPACE AND THE FIRST DOWN
[ct=2066.302] INSIDE THE 30.
[ct=2071.577] COWBOYS SIDELINE EYE
[ct=2072.891] COWBOYS SIDELINE IRATE.
[ct=2074.244] WANTING A HOLDING PENALTY.
[ct=2074.244] FIRST DOWN AT THE 29.
[ct=2075.610] >> HE’S KILLING THEM.
[ct=2076.955] HE KILLS A LOT OF TEAMS WITH
[ct=2078.300] THIS.
[ct=2079.487] BECAUSE HE’S WILLING TO STAY IN
[ct=2080.919] THE POCKET.
[ct=2082.255] THE COWBOYS FINALLY ANSWERED
[ct=2083.493] WITH SOME MAN COVERAGE.
[ct=2084.896] THE PROBLEM WITH MAN COVERAGE,
[ct=2087.574] YOU’VE GOT YOUR BACK TURNED TO
[ct=2087.574] THE QUARTERBACK.
[ct=2090.090] AND THE MINUTE YOU TURN YOUR
[ct=2090.090] BACK ON THIS QUARTERBACK, IT’S
[ct=2092.817] GOING TO BE FIRST AND 10 FOR THE
[ct=2096.871] >> Mike: 41, THE COWBOYS ROOKIE
[ct=2099.504] OUT OF B.C., BOSTON COLLEGE.
[ct=2102.037] HE WAS THE ONE THE COACHING
[ct=2103.504] STAFF WANT TO SEE.
[ct=2103.504] FIRST AND 10.
[ct=2107.446] BARKLEY.
[ct=2110.142] TO THE 35
[ct=2111.432] KNEELAND.
[ct=2112.784] PART OF THAT EDGE ROTATION.
[ct=2114.132] THE GUYS WHO ARE TRYING TO FILL
[ct=2118.076] THE MICAH PARSONS VOID.
[ct=2118.076] KNEELAND MADE THE STOP.
[ct=2119.436] >> Cris: I’M NOT SURE HOW SAQUON
[ct=2122.064] BARKLEY HELD ON TO THAT BALL.
[ct=2123.375] YOU SAW GREAT HUSTLE OUT OF
[ct=2124.728] MARSHAWN KNEELAND.
[ct=2125.973] WATCH THE TAIL END OF THE PLAY.
[ct=2127.397] 94 IS GOING TO COME RIGHT BACK
[ct=2128.752] HERE AND GET HIS HAND RIGHT ON
[ct=2132.638] THAT IS A FUMBLE ALMOST 90% OF
[ct=2132.638] THE TIME.
[ct=2135.358] AND SOMEHOW THE STRENGTH OF
[ct=2139.317] SAQUON BARKLEY HELD ON.
[ct=2140.656] >> Mike: HE’S GOT PLENTY OF
[ct=2144.566] IT’S NOT THE OLD STUFF.
[ct=2146.029] 585 OFF THE RACK?
[ct=2146.029] YOU GOT IT, PAL?
[ct=2147.359] >> Cris: JUST ONE TIME, I’D LIKE
[ct=2149.876] TO DO ANYTHING WITH THE BAR
[ct=2151.317] OTHER THAN DIE.
[ct=2152.587] I’D PREFER NOT TO DIE.
[ct=2155.250] BUT ANYTHING ELSE.
[ct=2156.528] >> Mike: FIRST PLACE YOUR EYES
[ct=2159.300] GO, TO THAT BAR.
[ct=2160.565] >> Cris: OH, MY GOSH.
[ct=2160.565] >> Mike: MAN.
[ct=2163.268] WITH ALL THOSE STRONG GUYS,
[ct=2165.834] WATCH THE SHOW THEMSELVES, WOW.
[ct=2169.849] THIRD AND 5 FOR PHILADELPHIA.
[ct=2172.478] DALLAS TRUSTING FOUR MEN.
[ct=2175.319] ALL KINDS OF TIME AND ESCAPES,
[ct=2175.319] RUNS.
[ct=2183.098] PASS RUSH NOT GETTING THERE,
[ct=2184.492] HURTS GETTING THERE.
[ct=2185.788] FIRST AND GOAL, PHILADELPHIA.
[ct=2187.109] >> Cris: I MEAN, THE COWBOYS
[ct=2188.442] PLAYED THIS PERFECTLY.
[ct=2192.422] ALL THEY WANTED TO DO WAS
[ct=2193.697] SQUEEZE JALEN LIKE THAT, AND
[ct=2193.697] THEY DID.
[ct=2195.061] THEY HAD HIM COVERED.
[ct=2196.390] THEY GOT HIM ALL CONTAINED IN
[ct=2199.054] WATCH THIS.
[ct=2201.719] A LITTLE ZOOM, THEY GOT IT, AND
[ct=2204.331] SOMEHOW HE’S STILL EVEN WEAVING.
[ct=2205.728] I REMEMBER AARON RODGERS WAS
[ct=2207.014] LIKE THAT WHEN YOU TRIED TO RUSH
[ct=2208.328] FOUR AGAINST HIM.
[ct=2209.661] HE COULD JUST ALWAYS FIND A WAY
[ct=2210.936] THROUGH THE CREASE.
[ct=2217.637] AND THERE ARE TWO CREASES THERE.
[ct=2218.902] >> Mike: FOR A YARD FOR TWO.
[ct=2223.073] EACH TEAM HAS NINE FIRST DOWNS.
[ct=2224.290] EVERYBODY’S SCORED ON THE FIRST
[ct=2224.290] THREE DRIVES.
[ct=2225.734] TWO FOR DALLAS.
[ct=2226.924] PHILADELPHIA’S TRYING TO MAKE IT
[ct=2228.304] TWO FOR THEM HALFWAY THROUGH THE
[ct=2228.304] SECOND QUARTER.
[ct=2233.566] >> Cris: YEAH, AND -- THAT WAS A
[ct=2234.891] THIRD AND 5 WHEN HE MADE THAT
[ct=2236.209] RUN RIGHT THERE, WHEN JALEN MADE
[ct=2238.863] THE RUN.
[ct=2240.230] AND THAT’S OUT OF TUSH PUSH
[ct=2240.230] RANGE.
[ct=2242.879] THAT’S WHEN THE COWBOYS HAVE TO
[ct=2244.230] DO IT, THAT’S YOUR CHANCE TO GET
[ct=2248.178] OFF THE FIELD.
[ct=2249.558] >> Mike: 3 OF 3 ON THIRD DOWNS
[ct=2256.430] THUS FAR TONIGHT.
[ct=2264.102] AGAIN.
[ct=2264.102] NOW KING.
[ct=2265.443] NOW TAKING IT TO THE PYLONS.
[ct=2266.862] GOT THERE.
[ct=2268.113] JALEN HURTS FOR THE SECOND TIME
[ct=2281.377] TONIGHT.
[ct=2284.394] >> Cris: ALL RIGHT, NO MICAH
[ct=2285.800] PARSONS AND YOU’RE STARTING TO
[ct=2285.800] FEEL THE PAIN RIGHT NOW, YOU
[ct=2288.363] REALLY ARE.
[ct=2291.093] DONOVAN HAS NOT FACTORED.
[ct=2293.708] LEFT THIS ENTIRE SIDE WIDE OPEN.
[ct=2296.419] AND JALEN HURTS IS KILLING THEM.
[ct=2299.010] I MEAN, HE HAS SIMPLY BEEN A
[ct=2300.395] ONE-MAN SHOW OUT HERE TONIGHT.
[ct=2301.740] BEEN DOING IT WITH HIS ARM,
[ct=2307.827] DOING IT WITH HIS LEGS.
[ct=2307.827] HIS RING ON HIS FINGER FOR THAT
[ct=2313.189] VERY REASON.
[ct=2315.793] >> Mike: ALL EVEN AT 14.
[ct=2317.128] BUT HE’S ONE OF THE TEN PLAYERS
[ct=2318.710] LOST TO THE SUPER BOWL TEAM.
[ct=2321.310] THAT’S MOST BY A CHAMPION ON THE
[ct=2322.651] DEFENSIVE SIDE OF THE BALL.
[ct=2323.970] AND NOW, THIS IS A VERY YOUNG
[ct=2325.266] GROUP.
[ct=2326.653] AVERAGE AGE JUST UNDER 25.
[ct=2327.988] SO PHILLY HAS THE YOUNGEST
[ct=2329.317] DEFENSE IN THE NFL.
[ct=2330.611] OF COURSE, THEY MISS THE
[ct=2334.570] LEADERSHIP OF A GUY LIKE GRAHAM.
[ct=2335.922] 206 GAMES AND 15 SEASONS.
[ct=2337.217] BUT THEY HAVE SOME YOUNG GUYS
[ct=2339.894] TRYING TO FIGURE OUT.
[ct=2342.513] TURPIN, THE RETURN, BROUGHT DOWN
[ct=2343.905] 32.
[ct=2347.897] I WONDER SYDNEY BROWN.
[ct=2350.543] JALEN CARTER SPINNING ON DAK
[ct=2353.205] PRESCOTT WHILE AN EAGLES PLAYER
[ct=2354.498] WAS INJURED AND CARTER WAS
[ct=2355.809] EJECTED.
[ct=2357.188] >> Cris: JALEN CARTER’S ONE OF
[ct=2357.188] MY FAVORITE PLAYERS.
[ct=2358.484] I THINK YOU KNOW THAT.
[ct=2361.144] THAT WAS ONE OF THE MOST
[ct=2361.144] RIDICULOUS THINGS.
[ct=2362.524] JUST MIGHT AS WELL HAVE SPIT IN
[ct=2365.170] THE FACE OF YOUR ENTIRE FOOTBALL
[ct=2366.440] TEAM, HEAD COACH, AND EVERYBODY
[ct=2367.885] INVOLVED IN THE ORGANIZATION.
[ct=2370.433] IF THEY LOSE THIS GAME TONIGHT,
[ct=2371.729] IT WILL BE BECAUSE JALEN CARTER
[ct=2373.143] DID THAT BEFORE HE EVEN PLAYED
[ct=2375.770] ONE SNAP IN THE GAME.
[ct=2378.396] >> Mike: 31, PRESCOTT OUT.
[ct=2381.086] CAUGHT.
[ct=2383.744] TO THE 33 YARD LINE.
[ct=2391.770] JACKSON AND BLAK EN
[ct=2394.406] >> Cris: THEY NEED JERGENS TO
[ct=2394.406] GET BACK TO THE FORM HE WAS TWO
[ct=2395.718] YEARS AGO.
[ct=2397.000] HE WAS A PRO BOWLER.
[ct=2398.353] HAD A FEW INJURIES HE HAD TO
[ct=2401.017] DEAL WITH, AS DID DAK PRESCOTT.
[ct=2402.311] IF THEY COULD GET FERGUSON AND
[ct=2404.993] TURPIN WORKING WITH PICKENS, AND
[ct=2406.403] OF COURSE CEEDEE LAMB ON THE
[ct=2415.617] OUTSIDE, THEY’VE GOT SOMETHING.
[ct=2416.960] >> Mike: ONE INCOMPLETI
[ct=2418.394] KEEPS IT THAT WAY.
[ct=2423.577] TURPIN ON THE SIDELINE.
[ct=2424.963] CREATE SPACE INTO PHILLY
[ct=2426.170] TERRITORY FOR A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=2427.498] >> Cris: GREAT JOB BY DAK.
[ct=2428.933] HE SAW THE SLOT LIFT, SO HE
[ct=2430.279] KNOWS THAT WAS GOING TO BE MAN
[ct=2431.592] COVERAGE AGAINST ONE OF THE
[ct=2434.216] TOUGHEST GUYS TO COVER ONE ON
[ct=2435.563] ONE, KaVONTAE TURPIN.
[ct=2436.954] GET HIM THE FOOTBALL, AND TAKE A
[ct=2436.954] CHANCE.
[ct=2438.140] OFTEN THAT TURNS INTO SOMETHING
[ct=2439.563] REALLY BIG.
[ct=2439.563] NICE JOB PLAYING QUARTERBACK
[ct=2444.816] THERE FOR DAK PRESCOTT.
[ct=2447.461] >> Mike: KEEP GOING AT ADOREE’
[ct=2449.148] JACKSON, AT CORNER HERE FOR
[ct=2452.805] PHILLY.
[ct=2456.778] WITH MAJOR ISSUES.
[ct=2458.151] "THE PAPER."
[ct=2458.151] STREAM IT AFTER THE GAME ONLY ON
[ct=2463.427] GET YOU GUYS SOME ICE CREAM.
[ct=2467.432] CHECK OUT THE EARLY EPISODES OF
[ct=2470.101] IF YOU LOVE "THE OFFICE," YOU
[ct=2472.803] WILL LOVE "THE PAPER."
[ct=2473.994] SEE IT ON PEACOCK TONIGHT AFTER
[ct=2478.107] THEY’RE INTO IT.
[ct=2479.416] BOUNCING TO THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=2480.727] SANDERS.
[ct=2484.713] BUT HE CAN’T GET THERE.
[ct=2487.310] A LATE FLAG AT THE BACK END OF
[ct=2487.310] IT.
[ct=2492.584] THE LEAGUE IS TALKING ABOUT
[ct=2492.584] SPORTSMANSHIP AND UNSPORTSMAN
[ct=2495.270] UNSPORTSMANLIKE CONDUCT IN TERMS
[ct=2495.270] OF TAUNTING AFTER PLAYS TO TRY
[ct=2499.340] TO CLEAN IT UP THIS YEAR.
[ct=2500.657] >> Referee: TAUNTING.
[ct=2501.960] DEFENSE, NUMBER 3.
[ct=2501.960] 15-YARD PENALTY.
[ct=2507.320] >> Mike: CRIS, WE’VE TALKED TO
[ct=2508.588] THE OFFICIALS AND TO EVERYONE IN
[ct=2508.588] NEW YORK.
[ct=2509.877] THIS IS SOMETHING THAT EVERY
[ct=2511.290] TEAM HAS BEEN TOLD, THEY’RE
[ct=2513.913] GOING TO BE WATCHING FOR THIS
[ct=2515.272] >> Cris: THE OLD POINT OF
[ct=2515.272] EMPHASIS.
[ct=2516.518] AND I DON’T THINK THAT SANDERS
[ct=2517.970] EVER EVEN SAW IT.
[ct=2520.593] HE SORT OF JUST STOOD UP AND
[ct=2521.808] WALKED OVER THAT WAY AND FLASHED
[ct=2523.300] THE TINY BIT, AND THAT WAS
[ct=2524.577] ENOUGH.
[ct=2525.889] IT IS GOING TO BE ENFORCED IN A
[ct=2528.457] WAY THAT WE HAVEN’T SEEN IN THE
[ct=2535.105] PAST THIS SEASON.
[ct=2536.465] >> Mike: FROM THE 35 ON FIRST
[ct=2539.217] DOWN, PRESCOTT, DEEP THRUST.
[ct=2539.217] COVERED.
[ct=2541.776] GETS AWAY FOR THE MOMENT.
[ct=2543.199] GETS AWAY AGAIN.
[ct=2544.516] DAK IS LOOKING TO THROW.
[ct=2547.157] HE’S GOING TO RUN.
[ct=2549.806] AND HE GETS THREE YARDS OUT OF
[ct=2551.202] WHAT BEGAN AT THE 32.
[ct=2553.831] JORDAN DAVIS ALMOST HAD A SACK.
[ct=2556.432] >> Cris: I MEAN, THIS IS
[ct=2557.785] TERRIFIC LIKE DAK PRESCOTT.
[ct=2560.427] THIS IS GOING TO END UP IN ONE
[ct=2562.977] OF THOSE SECOND DOWN AND 20 KIND
[ct=2562.977] OF SITUATIONS.
[ct=2565.697] AND HE SCRAMBLES OUT, AND YES,
[ct=2568.384] HE ONLY GETS THREE OR FOUR
[ct=2569.684] YARDS, BUT IT REALLY MEANT ABOUT
[ct=2572.337] 10, 12 YARDS TO HIS OFFENSE.
[ct=2575.109] AND SO FAR DAK AND THAT TIED-UP
[ct=2576.267] HAMSTRING THAT MELISSA WAS
[ct=2576.267] TALKING ABOUT, WHATEVER THEY
[ct=2580.317] DID, THEY FIXED IT.
[ct=2581.642] >> Mike: HE COULD NOT HAVE DONE
[ct=2582.934] THAT A SEASON AGO.
[ct=2584.351] THAT WAS BEFORE THE
[ct=2586.948] HE WAS STILL HEALING.
[ct=2589.614] THE HANDOFF.
[ct=2591.051] TURPIN FOR THE 27 YARD LINE.
[ct=2593.674] SO A LOT OF TURPIN HERE BEING
[ct=2594.878] USED IN THIS OPENING HALF.
[ct=2596.315] >> Cris: THEY’RE DOING A LOT
[ct=2597.618] WITH FORMATIONS AND MOTIONS
[ct=2600.227] HERE, MIKE, BECAUSE THAT TIME
[ct=2602.923] CEEDEE LAMB WAS IN MOTION REALLY
[ct=2604.276] FOR THE FIRST TIME OVER TO
[ct=2604.276] PICKENS’ SIDE.
[ct=2605.613] THEN WHAT THEY’RE GOING TO DO,
[ct=2606.827] THEY’RE GOING TO THROW EYEBALLS
[ct=2609.622] THERE AND RUN BACK THAT WAY.
[ct=2610.901] THEY’RE TRYING TO GET YOU TO
[ct=2612.155] ADJUST TO THEIR TWO STAR PLAYERS
[ct=2626.695] AND RUN AWAY.
[ct=2626.695] >> Mike: THIRD AND 2.
[ct=2632.182] FIRST DOWN FOR WILLIAMS.
[ct=2634.836] DEVONTA’S GOT TWO TOUCHDOWNS
[ct=2636.086] TAKES IT TO THE 23 YARD LINE.
[ct=2638.790] EFFECTIVELY.
[ct=2640.114] >> Cris: THEY’RE GETTING GOOD
[ct=2641.411] BLOCKS INSIDE TOO.
[ct=2644.113] COOPER, BEEBE, TYLER, BOOKER,
[ct=2645.420] ALL THOSE YOUNG GUYS PLAYING.
[ct=2648.147] NOW THEY GO TO THE HURRY-UP.
[ct=2648.147] ALTHOUGH REALLY YOU WOULD LIKE
[ct=2652.087] TO BURN A LITTLE CLOCK HERE.
[ct=2652.087] I DON’T KNOW HOW FAST I WANT TO
[ct=2658.765] GET UP THERE, LOCK THEM IN,
[ct=2660.068] DON’T LET THEM START THE TWO.
[ct=2662.684] THEN HERE WE GO.
[ct=2662.684] LOOK AT THAT CLOCK.
[ct=2666.667] THE THROW.
[ct=2669.508] INSIDE TO LAMB.
[ct=2671.980] CAUGHT, INCOMPLETE, INCOMPLETE
[ct=2674.699] ON THE FAR SIDE, HIT THE GROUND.
[ct=2675.987] IT WILL BE SECOND DOWN.
[ct=2681.335] SO BRIAN SCHOTTENHEIMER’S THE
[ct=2682.638] COORDINATOR, THE HEAD COACH --
[ct=2684.044] AS YOU GET A LOOK AT THAT BALL,
[ct=2686.578] CLEARLY HITS THE GROUND.
[ct=2687.938] >> Cris: "A," THEY’VE BEEN
[ct=2689.219] SEPARATING THEIR TWO STAR
[ct=2689.219] RECEIVERS.
[ct=2691.985] BUT WE’VE SEEN A LOT OF TIGHT
[ct=2691.985] FORMATIONS.
[ct=2694.669] WE’VE SEEN A LOT OF QUICK
[ct=2697.268] MOTIONS TO TRY AND FORCE THE
[ct=2697.268] DEFENSES TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS.
[ct=2699.970] REMEMBER, THIS IS A VERY YOUNG
[ct=2701.269] EAGLES DEFENSE NOW.
[ct=2702.555] THEY SUBSTITUTED IN A LOT OF
[ct=2703.891] GUYS THAT THEY LOST IN FREE
[ct=2703.891] AGENCY.
[ct=2706.560] AND IT’S SHOWING.
[ct=2707.904] >> Mike: SECOND AND 10.
[ct=2709.195] PRESCOTT THROWS.
[ct=2714.498] OFF TO LAMB, AND INCOMPLETE.
[ct=2714.498] BYRON YOUNG.
[ct=2718.540] AND HE WAS REACTING AFTER HIS
[ct=2719.886] PASS RUSH.
[ct=2725.164] BUT DORIAN JACKSON --
[ct=2726.452] >> Cris: BEST PLAY OF THE NIGHT
[ct=2727.902] FOR ADOREE’ JACKSON, AND IT WAS
[ct=2730.548] A BIG ONE.
[ct=2731.804] CEEDEE -- OH, IT WAS ALMOST
[ct=2731.804] PICKED OFF BY YOUNG ON THE
[ct=2737.175] BALL WAS LATE GETTING THERE, AND
[ct=2738.433] ADOREE’ JACKSON MADE HIS FIRST
[ct=2741.060] BIG PLAY OF THE NIGHT.
[ct=2745.014] >> Mike: THIRD AND 10.
[ct=2746.428] >> Cris: MIGHT GET PICKENS ONE
[ct=2749.097] ON ONE WITH MITCHELL DOWN HERE.
[ct=2749.097] THEY’VE BEEN PLAYING A LITTLE OF
[ct=2753.084] THAT.
[ct=2755.724] >> Mike: PRESCOTT LOOKING WEST.
[ct=2756.997] PICKENS, END ZONE.
[ct=2758.423] PICKENS ADJUSTING AND
[ct=2758.423] INCOMPLETE.
[ct=2763.582] AS HE AND MITCHELL WERE INVOLVED
[ct=2766.338] NO FLAGS, FOURTH DOWN, FIELD
[ct=2766.338] GOAL ATTEMPT UP.
[ct=2767.675] >> Cris: DEFINITELY GOT A
[ct=2770.400] LITTLE -- A LITTLE INTERESTING
[ct=2771.680] RIGHT ABOUT THERE.
[ct=2774.280] I THINK THEY WERE SORT OF
[ct=2775.691] PUSHING ALMOST EQUALLY, AND THE
[ct=2777.006] OFFICIALS PROBABLY SAW THE SAME
[ct=2777.006] THING.
[ct=2780.942] SO NO CALL.
[ct=2783.592] >> Mike: THERE’S TIME FOR EITHER
[ct=2786.189] TEAM THAT A THIRD DOWN WAS NOT
[ct=2786.189] CONVERTED IN THIS ONE.
[ct=2788.975] AND HERE IS AUBREY.
[ct=2790.241] SENSATIONAL LEG.
[ct=2790.241] GOOD ACCURACY.
[ct=2799.493] WE’LL HAVE IT FOR YOU IN
[ct=2800.929] FEBRUARY ON NBC AND PEACOCK.
[ct=2803.525] THE OPENING CEREMONY IS THE
[ct=2806.118] FRIDAY BEFORE SUPER BOWL SUNDAY.
[ct=2810.211] A CUP OF WEEKS WE ALL LOOK
[ct=2814.080] FORWARD IN FEBRUARY.
[ct=2815.483] AUBREY TRYING TO PUT ONE IN
[ct=2816.762] PLAY.
[ct=2819.418] THIS TIME HE DOES AND GETS A
[ct=2831.415] LITTLE BIT OF A FOBBLE ON IT.
[ct=2834.045] >> Cris: TAKE A LOOK AT OUR
[ct=2835.387] "NEXT UP STAT" THIS OFFENSE HAS
[ct=2836.765] BEEN POWERED BY IT, JALEN HURTS
[ct=2836.765] AND HIS LEGS ALL NIGHT LONG.
[ct=2839.416] THEY DON’T HAVE A PASS COMPLETED
[ct=2840.625] OVER EIGHT YARDS.
[ct=2843.341] IT’S BEEN PLAY AFTER PLAY WHEN
[ct=2844.694] THEY HAD TO HAVE IT, JALEN HURTS
[ct=2847.305] HAS SIMPLY PULLED IT DOWN.
[ct=2848.705] YOU CAN SEE THE MAN COVERAGE
[ct=2848.705] RUNNING AROUND BEHIND.
[ct=2850.091] THEY’RE DOING THEIR BEST TO
[ct=2852.589] MATCH UP WITH THESE RECEIVERS.
[ct=2854.050] BUT THEY HAVE YET TO MATCH UP
[ct=2855.347] WITH THE RUNNING SKILLS OF JALEN
[ct=2859.306] >> Mike: COMING DOWNFIELD IN
[ct=2860.587] PASSING IN THE LEAGUE, EIGHT
[ct=2868.656] YARDS, THE LONGEST RECEPTION FOR
[ct=2868.656] GOEDERT.
[ct=2871.244] NO TARGETS FOR A.J. BROWN LEFT.
[ct=2871.244] BARKLEY LEFT.
[ct=2875.291] WAITING ARMS OF SAM WILLIAMS.
[ct=2875.291] FOURTH PLAYER ON THIS DALLAS
[ct=2876.516] TEAM THIS YEAR.
[ct=2877.982] >> Cris: YEAH, WE’RE SEEING THE
[ct=2879.282] ROTATION ALONG THE DEFENSIVE
[ct=2880.577] LINE OF THE DALLAS COWBOYS.
[ct=2883.239] THEY’RE GOING TO USE MARSHAWN
[ct=2884.482] KNEELAND AND SAM WILLIAMS ON
[ct=2885.912] EARLY DOWNS.
[ct=2892.527] AND THEN DANTE FOWLER AND MORE
[ct=2892.527] OF THE PASS RUSH SITUATION.
[ct=2893.830] THEY’RE TRYING TO KEEP THESE
[ct=2895.158] GUYS FRESH IN THERE.
[ct=2896.486] >> Mike: TRYING TO FIN
[ct=2909.631] >> Melissa: COMING UP AT
[ct=2912.488] HALFTIME, WE’LL BREAK DOWN A
[ct=2913.730] CHIPPY FIRST HALF HERE AT
[ct=2915.097] LINCOLN FINANCIAL FIELD AND LOOK
[ct=2916.449] AHEAD TO AN MVP SHOWDOWN AT
[ct=2917.782] BUFFALO SUNDAY NIGHT.
[ct=2919.037] MIKE, BACK TO YOU.
[ct=2920.470] >> Mike: ALL RIGHT, SEE YOU AND
[ct=2921.747] THE GUYS AT HALFTIME.
[ct=2923.118] "FOOTBALL NIGHT IN AMERICA" TEAM
[ct=2925.769] ON HAND.
[ct=2927.027] "NIGHTLY NEWS."
[ct=2928.445] THE "TODAY" SHOW AS WELL THE
[ct=2928.445] LAST COUPLE OF DAYS.
[ct=2930.978] FUN TO HAVE THE WHOLE NBC FAMILY
[ct=2932.347] HERE FOR KICKOFF GAME, 2025.
[ct=2937.692] SECOND AND 6 FOR HURTS.
[ct=2939.063] WILLIAMS, PICKENS THREW IT TO
[ct=2941.713] THE SIDELINE, THIRD DOWN.
[ct=2944.361] >> Cris: I TELL YOU, THE ONE
[ct=2945.704] THING I DID NOT EXPECT OUT OF
[ct=2948.350] THIS FIRST HALF IS THAT WE WOULD
[ct=2952.283] SEE NO PASSES REALLY THROWN TO
[ct=2953.635] THE OUTSIDE, TO THE WIDE
[ct=2953.635] RECEIVERS OF THE PHILADELPHIA
[ct=2957.653] I MEAN, YOU HAVE DeVONTA SMITH
[ct=2960.219] AND A.J. BROWN, FOR THEM TO AT
[ct=2961.535] THIS POINT ONLY HAVE ONE CATCH
[ct=2962.930] FOR SIX AGAINST THE SECONDARY
[ct=2966.831] THAT IS COMING OFF OF INJURY,
[ct=2968.278] JUST THOUGHT WE’D SEE NOW IS THE
[ct=2970.916] MOMENT OF THIS DALLAS DEFENSE.
[ct=2972.217] THEY HAVE THAT THIRD AND 6 THAT
[ct=2978.805] THEY HAVE BEEN BEGGING FOR.
[ct=2982.861] >> Mike: JALEN HURTS WITH TIME.
[ct=2982.861] NOW DOWNFIELD.
[ct=2990.748] AND IT IS BROUGHT IN MY JAHAN
[ct=2990.748] DOTSON.
[ct=2993.556] DOTSON ABLE TO PULL IT IN.
[ct=2994.800] 51 ON THE PLAY.
[ct=2997.454] >> Cris: WELL, THEY ARE JUST AS
[ct=3001.382] HAPPY WITH JAHAN DOTSON GETTING
[ct=3004.070] THE OPPORTUNITY AGAINST KYLER
[ct=3004.070] ELAM.
[ct=3005.403] IT WASN’T THAT ELAM WASN’T
[ct=3006.721] THERE, BUT YOU’VE GOT TO BE ABLE
[ct=3006.721] TO MAKE THOSE PLAYS ON THE BALL.
[ct=3009.332] AND THE EAGLES JUST CONTINUE TO
[ct=3012.060] FLY DOWN THE FIELD.
[ct=3014.841] >> Mike: ON THE 26, HURTS, ELAM,
[ct=3016.038] SECOND DOWN.
[ct=3016.038] BARKLEY WILL TAKE THE BALL WITH
[ct=3025.337] JAHAN DOTSON, THE RECEIVER THAT
[ct=3026.624] HE GOT LAST YEAR IN AUGUST IN A
[ct=3028.077] TRADE WITH WASHINGTON.
[ct=3030.694] 51-YARD CATCH, THE LONGEST SINCE
[ct=3030.694] HIS ROOKIE SEASON.
[ct=3033.229] >> Cris: YEAH, DOTSON WAS THE
[ct=3034.625] FIRST-ROUND PICK HIMSELF.
[ct=3036.002] 16th OVERALL PICK.
[ct=3041.241] AND HE IS AN EXCELLENT PLAYER.
[ct=3044.001] >> Mike: METCHIE FROM HOUSTON.
[ct=3045.162] SO DEPTH IN THAT RECEIVING CORPS
[ct=3050.513] PHILLY GETS THE BALL TO START
[ct=3050.513] THE SECOND HALF.
[ct=3054.525] A CHANCE TO DOUBLE UP HERE.
[ct=3054.525] 26.
[ct=3055.776] HURTS TO BARKLEY AGAIN.
[ct=3057.181] OPEN FIELD.
[ct=3058.510] FORGET ABOUT IT.
[ct=3061.190] SAQUON POWERS THROUGH TO THE 18,
[ct=3063.884] PICKUP OF EIGHT.
[ct=3066.505] >> Cris: ALWAYS WONDERED WHAT IT
[ct=3067.904] WOULD FEET LIKE TO BE GERON
[ct=3070.539] BLAND IN THAT SITUATION, LOOKING
[ct=3071.887] AT SAY WALK BARKLEY COMING AT
[ct=3071.887] YOU.
[ct=3074.495] THERE A COMBINATION OF A GUY
[ct=3077.157] THAT CAN BEAT YOU WITH HIS --
[ct=3077.157] ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU’RE PLAYING
[ct=3078.511] HIS MOVES.
[ct=3079.852] HE CAN RUN RIGHT THROUGH YOU.
[ct=3079.852] >> Mike: YOU WANT TO TRY?
[ct=3081.072] >> Mike: OKAY.
[ct=3083.788] THE WAY YOU SAID IT, I THOUGHT
[ct=3091.651] YOU WERE INTERESTED IN THAT.
[ct=3092.998] >> Cris: NOW THEY GO HEFTY AND
[ct=3094.400] YOUR FIRST THOUGHT IS THEY’RE
[ct=3099.659] GOING TO RUN HURTS.
[ct=3102.419] >> Mike: THE THROW, BARKLEY
[ct=3103.733] BRINGS IT DOWN INBOUNDS, AND
[ct=3106.364] THEN GETS OUT OF BOUNDS TO STOP
[ct=3109.063] THE CLOCK AT THE 15 YARD LINE.
[ct=3110.420] CHAINS MOVE.
[ct=3111.603] EAGLES KEEP ALL THREE TIME-OUTS
[ct=3114.214] WITH 64 SECONDS TO GO.
[ct=3115.676] >> Cris: GREAT JOB BY BARKLEY
[ct=3118.300] RIGHT THERE ON A BIG DOWN.
[ct=3119.588] IF THEY HAD MISSED THAT THROW,
[ct=3119.588] THEY WOULD HAVE HAD TO HAVE
[ct=3122.323] SETTLED FOR THE FIELD GOAL, IN
[ct=3123.554] ALL LIKELIHOOD.
[ct=3124.973] NOT ONLY DID HE MAKE THE CATCH,
[ct=3130.199] BUT HE GOT HIS FEET DOWN.
[ct=3131.595] >> Mike: EBERFLUS TRYING TO FIND
[ct=3132.892] THE ANSWER.
[ct=3134.294] BEARS HEAD COACH LAST YEAR.
[ct=3134.294] CALLING THE DEFENSIVE SIGNALS
[ct=3136.900] FOR DALLAS.
[ct=3139.561] OPPOSITE NICK SIRIANNI.
[ct=3140.871] THOSE TWO WERE AT THE SAME TIME
[ct=3143.524] IN INDIANAPOLIS.
[ct=3144.871] FROM THE 15.
[ct=3146.167] FIVE IN THE PATTERN FOR HURTS.
[ct=3152.817] LOOKING TO ESCAPE.
[ct=3156.834] PICKUP OF FIVE.
[ct=3156.834] CONTACT IN THE END.
[ct=3163.470] HURTS GETS UP.
[ct=3164.791] LOOKING OKAY ON THE SIDELINE
[ct=3167.469] CLARK WAS THE ONE CHASING.
[ct=3167.469] >> Cris: I DON’T THINK DAMONE
[ct=3171.372] CLARK DID THIS.
[ct=3172.834] HE JUST HAD MOMENTUM GOING AND
[ct=3174.094] TOOK OUT SOMEBODY ON
[ct=3175.449] SIDELINE.
[ct=3176.729] THAT’S REALLY WHAT CAUSED THE
[ct=3186.037] BIGGER ISSUE.
[ct=3187.392] THIS TOWN.
[ct=3188.580] >> Mike: GOOD TO HAVE YOUR BACK,
[ct=3190.076] SECOND AND 5.
[ct=3191.399] STILL ALL THREE TIME-OUTS.
[ct=3194.039] SO PLENTY OF RUN OPTIONS
[ct=3200.629] AVAILABLE FOR SIRIANNI AND KEVIN
[ct=3203.291] THE OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR.
[ct=3208.610] TOUCHDOWN, PHILADELPHIA ON TOP.
[ct=3211.314] AND AGAIN, WORDS EXCHANGED.
[ct=3213.970] BIG SCRUM OF FOLKS AFTER THE
[ct=3219.233] SCORE.
[ct=3220.643] GOOD JOB BY THE OFFICIALS
[ct=3220.643] GETTING EVERYBODY SEPARATED
[ct=3223.270] AFTER BARKLEY’S FIRST TOUCHDOWN
[ct=3223.270] OF THE YEAR.
[ct=3227.272] >> Cris: ONE OF THE BIG QUESTION
[ct=3231.166] MARKS WITHOUT MEKHI BACK AT
[ct=3232.475] GUARD, THAT WAS BEAUTIFULLY DONE
[ct=3235.214] BY HIS REPLACEMENT, KYLER STEEN.
[ct=3236.534] THE COWBOYS KNEW IT.
[ct=3237.814] THEY KNEW IF SAQUON BARKLEY
[ct=3239.235] STARTED RUNNING PAST THE LINE OF
[ct=3240.460] SCRIMMAGE, THEY WERE GOING TO
[ct=3241.759] HAVE A REALLY TOUGH TIME TRYING
[ct=3244.432] TO TACKLE HIM.
[ct=3244.432] AND LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE, THEY
[ct=3256.426] CAN’T.
[ct=3259.141] >> Mike: PHILADELPHIA, THREE
[ct=3261.743] DRIVES, 30 PLAYS, 216 YARDS, 3
[ct=3264.443] >> Mike: TOMORROW NIGHT, GAME
[ct=3265.890] TWO.
[ct=3268.483] SAO PAOLO, BRAZIL.
[ct=3269.820] PA TRICK MAHOMES AND THE CHIEFS
[ct=3271.195] BEGIN AGAINST JUSTIN HERBERT AND
[ct=3273.707] THE LOS ANGELES CHARGERS
[ct=3275.141] STREAMING EXCLUSIVELY ON
[ct=3276.466] YOUTUBE.
[ct=3277.789] THE SCENE DOWN IN SAO PAOLO,
[ct=3280.432] LOOK FORWARD TO WATCHING THAT E
[ct=3281.793] BOARD IF YOU JUST GOT A NORMAL
[ct=3281.793] RETURN.
[ct=3284.441] NOW STARTING AT THE 12 YARD
[ct=3285.747] LINE, THAT MAY END UP CHANGING.
[ct=3288.428] BUT OVER, I THINK THE DALLAS
[ct=3288.428] COWBOYS FULLY UNDERSTAND, THEIR
[ct=3291.081] ONLY PATH OF WINNING THIS GAME
[ct=3291.081] IS TO SCORE ALMOST EVERY TIME
[ct=3292.329] THEY GET THE BALL.
[ct=3295.110] THEIR DEFENSE CANNOT STOP THE
[ct=3296.311] EAGLES FROM RUNNING THE
[ct=3297.683] >> Mike: AND CREDIT TO JAKE
[ct=3297.683] ELLIOTT.
[ct=3300.371] A HARD TO CATCH KICKOFF FORCES
[ct=3302.919] THE COWBOYS TO START AT THEIR
[ct=3302.919] OWN 12.
[ct=3308.322] GOES SIDELINE FOR LAMB.
[ct=3310.899] FLAG IN.
[ct=3315.085] BENNETT IN THERE AT THE CORNER
[ct=3315.085] SPOT.
[ct=3317.746] DEFENSE, NUMBER 23.
[ct=3319.025] THE BALL WILL BE PLATED AT THE
[ct=3319.025] SITE OF THE FOUL.
[ct=3325.646] >> Mike: DEFINITELY LOOKING FOR
[ct=3326.913] CORNERS, THE PHILADELPHI
[ct=3328.222] ARE.
[ct=3328.222] >> Cris: TRYING TO REPLACE
[ct=3338.919] DARIUS SLAY.
[ct=3342.883] >> Mike: CONTACT WITH LAMB.
[ct=3344.284] RULED BENNETT IS GUILTY.
[ct=3345.558] TAKES THE BALL TO THE 21.
[ct=3345.558] 38 SECONDS.
[ct=3349.613] DAK.
[ct=3352.171] COMPLETE TO FERGUSON.
[ct=3354.895] FLAG DOWN.
[ct=3354.895] AROUND THE QUARTERBACK.
[ct=3357.438] LET’S SEE.
[ct=3358.893] IF THIS IS GOING TO PUSH HIM
[ct=3360.220] OUT.
[ct=3360.220] >> Cris: I THINK THEY MIGHT HAVE
[ct=3361.545] GOTTEN --
[ct=3362.802] >> Referee: PERSONAL FOUL.
[ct=3364.202] RUSHING THE PASSER.
[ct=3368.189] >> Mike: SECOND 15-YARD PENALTY
[ct=3369.405] ON NOLAN SMITH.
[ct=3376.046] THE UNSPORTSMANLIKE CONDUCT.
[ct=3377.452] COSTLY ON THE LAST DRIVE.
[ct=3378.772] TERRY McCAULEY, OUR RULES
[ct=3382.661] ANALYST, IS BACK.
[ct=3384.059] FORCIBLE CONTACT?
[ct=3385.380] >> I THINK SO, MIKEY.
[ct=3386.743] PUSHES HIS HEAD BACK.
[ct=3389.295] IT’S A PRETTY GOOD BLOW TO THE
[ct=3389.295] HEAD.
[ct=3390.735] CORRECT CALL.
[ct=3392.100] >> Mike: THANK YOU, TERRY.
[ct=3393.326] GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US AGAIN
[ct=3397.335] I REMEMBER BRANDON AUBREY HAD
[ct=3398.691] THE LONGEST LEG IN THE LEAGUE
[ct=3400.018] THAT WE’VE SEEN THE LAST COUPLE
[ct=3401.253] OF YEARS.
[ct=3406.605] THAT’S IN FIELD GOAL RANGE.
[ct=3418.669] WE’LL SEE TIME-OUTS AT 34 OND DO
[ct=3418.669] COMING UP.
[ct=3421.339] >> Cris: I TELL YOU, MIKE, I
[ct=3423.978] THINK I MIGHT TRY TO WORK INSIDE
[ct=3426.712] A LITTLE BIT ON JAHAN CAMPBELL,
[ct=3428.092] THE ROOKIE LINEBACKER.
[ct=3430.597] HE IS SUPER TALENTED, BUT WHEN
[ct=3432.049] YOU GET IN THESE KINDS OF
[ct=3433.321] SITUATIONS, YOU LIKE TO GRAB
[ct=3435.922] SOME YOUTH.
[ct=3438.665] >> Mike: OUT OF BOUNDS.
[ct=3441.268] BRINGS UP THIRD DOWN.
[ct=3445.285] 20 SECONDS LEFT.
[ct=3447.944] I THINK OF AUBREY SO HIS LEG.
[ct=3450.644] USUALLY 60-YARDERS ARE IN PLAY,
[ct=3453.469] THAT WOULD MEAN GETTING TO THE
[ct=3454.830] 42 YARD LINE JUST A DOZEN YARDS
[ct=3458.827] THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF READ
[ct=3460.123] INTO THE DIRECTION AUBREY WOULD
[ct=3462.869] BE KICKING RIGHT NOW.
[ct=3464.213] NOT A HEAVY WIND, BUT IT IS
[ct=3465.526] GOING THAT DIRECTION.
[ct=3469.536] LEFT TO RIGHT AS YOU WALK.
[ct=3470.846] >> Cris: ZONE DEFENSE FOR CEEDEE
[ct=3473.540] WORKING THE MIDDLE.
[ct=3474.934] >> Mike: QUICK, PRESCOTT, A
[ct=3476.183] LITTLE BIT BEHIND PICKENS, DID
[ct=3477.497] HE BRING IT IN, YES, AT THE 45.
[ct=3480.205] HE’S GOT IT.
[ct=3481.605] CLOCK’S STILL RUNNING.
[ct=3482.775] THEY WANT TO SAVE IT
[ct=3484.189] MILLIGRAM.
[ct=3484.189] GOT TO GET IT SNAPPED QUICKL
[ct=3485.532] 8 SECONDS NOW.
[ct=3488.192] IT’S FINALLY STOPPED.
[ct=3488.192] SCHOTTENHEIMER SAID HE WAS
[ct=3489.522] TRYING TO GET A TIME-OUT.
[ct=3490.763] HE’S TALKING TO THE OFFICIAL ON
[ct=3492.100] HIS SIDE NOW.
[ct=3494.741] WE’LL GET A CONVERSATION IF TIME
[ct=3496.134] WILL BE PUT BACK ON THE CLOCK.
[ct=3497.516] >> Referee: THIRD AND FINAL
[ct=3498.819] CHARGED TIME-OUT, DALLAS.
[ct=3500.107] 30 SECONDS.
[ct=3501.355] GAME CLOCK OPERATOR, PLEASE
[ct=3502.751] RESET THE GAME CLOCK TO 15
[ct=3505.511] SECONDS.
[ct=3506.757] 15 ON THE GAME CLOCK, PLEASE.
[ct=3508.087] >> Mike: TRYING TO GET THE
[ct=3509.387] TIME-OUT, THE OFFICIAL’S TRYING
[ct=3512.112] TO GET THE TIME SPOTTED.
[ct=3514.705] YOU’VE GOT TO PUT SOME THOUGHT
[ct=3514.705] INTO THIS.
[ct=3517.407] >> Cris: YOU’VE GOT TO PUT SOME
[ct=3518.724] THOUGHT INTO IT, SO THE EAGLES
[ct=3519.994] HAVE PUT SOME THOUGHT INTO IT AS
[ct=3521.250] THEY’RE GOING TO PROTECT THE
[ct=3522.669] BOUNDARIES AND NOT GIVE YOU
[ct=3523.984] ANYTHING CHEAP TO MAKE THIS DEAL
[ct=3525.323] GO A LITTLE EASIER.
[ct=3526.603] IF YOU WANT TO TAKE A CHANCE,
[ct=3526.603] THERE’S NO REASON YOU COULDN’T
[ct=3529.330] TAKE ONE AND THROW IT UP DOWN
[ct=3530.663] THE FIELD TO ONE OF THESE GREAT
[ct=3534.599] COL’líj
[ct=3534.599] $(PáCH WIDE RECEIVERS.
[ct=3537.266] >> Mike: PHILADELPHIA’S TAKING A
[ct=3538.614] TIME-OUT HERE.
[ct=3538.614] MELISSA?
[ct=3541.288] >> Melissa: I’VE BEEN WALKING
[ct=3542.681] DAK, AFTER THAT FIRST TOUCHDOWN
[ct=3545.220] HE HIGH FIVES THE ENTIRE OFFENSE
[ct=3546.623] AND SAID TO THE GUYS, "LET’S
[ct=3547.941] SUSTAIN THIS."
[ct=3549.213] AFTER THE SECOND TOUCHDOWN, SO
[ct=3549.213] FIRED UP.
[ct=3550.588] WENT DOWN THE BENCH, SLAPPING
[ct=3553.257] ALL THE GUYS ON THE SHOULDERS,
[ct=3554.530] AND SAID, "COME RIGHT BACK."
[ct=3557.206] THEN BEFORE THIS DRIVE, "HEY, BE
[ct=3558.483] READY TO SCORE SOME MORE
[ct=3558.483] POINTS."
[ct=3561.168] HE HAS BEEN SO ANIMATED AND SO
[ct=3562.534] ENERGETIC ON THE SIDELINE.
[ct=3563.846] >> Mike: 32, 10th YEAR IN THE
[ct=3566.493] LEAGUE.
[ct=3567.913] >> Cris: REALLY IS.
[ct=3569.148] YOU’RE GOING TO SEE THESE
[ct=3570.528] CORNERS STAYING OUT WIDE.
[ct=3571.758] THEY’RE NOT GIVING A QUICK OUT
[ct=3577.141] >> Mike: TIME-OUTS WITH DALLAS.
[ct=3579.753] AT THE 35.
[ct=3582.451] TRYING TO GIVE IT TO THE
[ct=3583.855] REFEREE’S GOT TO TOUCH, HE DOES.
[ct=3586.419] THEY DO WITH 3 SECONDS LEFT, AND
[ct=3589.096] THEY’LL GET A CHANCE TO TRY A
[ct=3590.398] FIELD GOAL INSIDE THE 55 YARDS,
[ct=3593.015] IT WILL BEEN 54, I BELIEVE.
[ct=3594.445] >> Cris: BEAUTIFULLY HANDLED
[ct=3597.005] THAT TIME BY THE DALLAS COWBOYS.
[ct=3598.459] AND OBVIOUSLY WE’VE HAD BEFORE
[ct=3599.718] WHERE IT DIDN’T WORK OUT QUITE
[ct=3601.057] SO WELL FOR THEM.
[ct=3602.402] BUT THEY HAD THAT WELL
[ct=3606.493] ORCHESTRATED, WELL COACHED.
[ct=3607.711] GOOD JOB BY SCHOTTENHEIMER AND
[ct=3609.038] HIS TEAM.
[ct=3611.664] >> Mike: AUBREY IN HIS CAREER,
[ct=3615.665] 24 OF 27, 0 FOR 50.
[ct=3616.966] A TIME-OUT HERE BEFORE HIS
[ct=3619.765] ATTEMPT FROM 53 YARDS.
[ct=3622.340] SO IN THE PAST, THEY’VE HAD
[ct=3623.759] THESE K-BALLS.
[ct=3625.056] THE FOOTBALLS THAT WERE JUST FOR
[ct=3625.056] KICKERS.
[ct=3626.322] AND THE KICKERS WOULD ONLY GET
[ct=3629.077] TO WORK THOSE BALLS IN OUT OF
[ct=3630.314] THE BOX FOR ABOUT 45 MINUTES
[ct=3634.211] BEFORE THE GAME.
[ct=3635.562] NOW, EACH TEAM, LIKE YOU DO WITH
[ct=3636.976] THE BALLS THEY USE ON OFFENSE,
[ct=3639.586] CAN WORK IN THESE KICKING BALLS
[ct=3639.586] DURING THE YEAR.
[ct=3642.262] SO THAT IT IS A FEELING AMONGST
[ct=3643.589] KICKERS AND SPECIAL TEAMS FOLKS
[ct=3646.213] AROUND THE LEAGUE, WE MAY SEE
[ct=3646.213] LONGER FIELD GOALS MADE.
[ct=3648.984] IT’S NOT A PROBLEM WITH THIS
[ct=3648.984] GUY.
[ct=3650.262] >> Cris: NO.
[ct=3652.929] >> Mike: HE CAN KICK ANYTHING
[ct=3652.929] INSIDE 60 YARDS.
[ct=3654.292] KEEP IN MIND THIS YEAR, WE’VE
[ct=3658.184] HAD SLIGHT ADJUSTMENTS TO THESE
[ct=3658.184] KICKING BALLS.
[ct=3667.508] FROM 53, AUBREY.
[ct=3668.862] HE’S SO SMOOTH WITH THAT SWING
[ct=3670.101] OF THE LEG.
[ct=3674.187] SEVEN POSSESSIONS IN THE HALF.
[ct=3674.187] SEVEN SCORES.
[ct=3675.454] DALLAS, TWO FIELD GOALS.
[ct=3679.439] AND CRIS, BACKED UP, THEY’RE
[ct=3680.763] VERY WELL DONE TO GET THREE
[ct=3682.082] POINTS OUT OF THAT.
[ct=3683.469] >> Cris: STOP ON ONE FIRST DOWN,
[ct=3684.828] THE ONLY NONTOUCHDOWN.
[ct=3686.042] >> Mike: MELISSA?
[ct=3687.357] >> Melissa: FOUR DRIVES,
[ct=3688.778] SCORES.
[ct=3690.074] WHAT’S WORKING FOR YOU GUYS?
[ct=3692.795] >> WE’RE GETTING COMPLETION.
[ct=3692.795] RUNNING THE BALL WELL.
[ct=3695.393] OUR GUYS ARE PLAYING HARD.
[ct=3695.393] IT’S A HELL OF A FOOTBALL GAME
[ct=3698.079] WE FEEL GOOD RIGHT NOW.
[ct=3700.747] >> Melissa: DEFENSIVELY, HOW DO
[ct=3701.983] YOU CONTAIN THE EEG JESS’
[ct=3703.404] RUSHING ATTACK, ESPECIALLY JALEN
[ct=3704.752] HURTS?
[ct=3705.953] >> WE’VE GOT TO GET THAT CLEANED
[ct=3711.317] MIKE TIRICO, CRIS COLLINSWORTH,
[ct=3712.794] MELISSA STARK ON THE SIDELINE.
[ct=3715.402] 70 DEGREES.
[ct=3719.313] PHILLY, WE MAY SEE A LITTLE MORE
[ct=3719.313] WIND.
[ct=3721.918] WE MAY GET LUCKY AND THE RAIN
[ct=3723.301] COULD MISS US TO THE WEST.
[ct=3724.657] WE’LL KEEP AN EYE ON IT.
[ct=3728.640] METCHIE DOWN THE SIDELINE.
[ct=3731.240] MELISSA A MOMENT AGO WITH NICK
[ct=3731.240] SIRIANNI.
[ct=3733.937] >> Melissa: NICK, THREE PERSONAL
[ct=3735.213] FOULS, EJECTION ON DEFENSE.
[ct=3735.213] WHAT WAS YOUR MESSAGE TO YOUR
[ct=3736.571] GUYS?
[ct=3737.940] >> YEAH, WE CAN’T HAVE ANY OF
[ct=3739.262] THOSE.
[ct=3740.523] OBVIOUSLY WE’VE GIVEN THEM SHORT
[ct=3741.898] FIELD THERE.
[ct=3741.898] THIS IS A GOOD OFFENSE AND WE
[ct=3744.538] CAN’T HELP THEM OUT AT ALL, SO
[ct=3745.851] WE CAN’T HAVE THOSE.
[ct=3747.208] >> Melissa: THREE TOUCHDOWNS, NO
[ct=3747.208] PUNTS ON OFFENSE.
[ct=3748.485] HOW DO YOU CONTINUE THAT IN THE
[ct=3748.485] SECOND HALF?
[ct=3751.246] >> YEAH, WE JUST CONTINUE TO
[ct=3752.615] CONTINUE DOING THE FUNDAMENTAL
[ct=3752.615] THINGS.
[ct=3755.259] BLOCKING, TAKING CARE OF THE
[ct=3756.513] FOOTBALL, MAKING GOOD CATCHES.
[ct=3757.906] JALEN’S GOING TO DO A GOOD JOB,
[ct=3759.200] BUT WE HAVE TO BE READY FOR THEM
[ct=3761.848] TO ADJUST, AND WE WILL AS WELL.
[ct=3761.848] >> Melissa: THANKS, NICK.
[ct=3763.231] >> THANK YOU.
[ct=3765.886] >> Mike: ALL ABOUT FUNDAMENTALS.
[ct=3767.214] NICK SIRIANNI HAS PROVEN THAT
[ct=3768.542] HURTS TO PASS.
[ct=3777.785] INSIDE.
[ct=3779.108] DOWN TO THE 32 YARD LINE, PICKUP
[ct=3779.108] OF FOUR.
[ct=3780.443] >> Cris: AND WE’VE GOT NEW
[ct=3781.811] LINEBACKERS FOR THE DALLAS
[ct=3783.139] COWBOYS AS WELL, RIGHT?
[ct=3784.391] KENNETH MURRAY COMES OVER.
[ct=3787.146] THEY MADE A DEAL WITH THE TITANS
[ct=3788.491] TO GET HIM.
[ct=3789.804] JACK SAN BORNE CAME OVER WITH
[ct=3789.804] MATT EBERFLUS.
[ct=3791.086] HE HAD HIM IN CHICAGO.
[ct=3795.193] SO A LOT OF MOVING PARTS.
[ct=3795.193] THIS DEFENSE IS GOING BETTER,
[ct=3797.821] BUT OBVIOUSLY NO MICAH PARSONS.
[ct=3801.668] IT’S BEEN VERY APPARENT.
[ct=3804.436] >> Mike: NO SACKS.
[ct=3808.313] HURTS HAS BEEN ABLE TO BUY TIME.
[ct=3812.353] A GAIN OF FIVE.
[ct=3813.663] TAKING IT BY HURTS.
[ct=3816.371] GOT IT AGAIN.
[ct=3817.725] BACK TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE
[ct=3826.881] GOEDERT, HIS FIKTDS BALL OF THE
[ct=3828.294] >> Cris: WATCH JALEN HURTS IN
[ct=3829.647] EVENTUALLY GOING TO GET SOME
[ct=3830.921] PRESSURE RIGHT HERE.
[ct=3830.921] WATCH HIM JUST STAND THERE.
[ct=3833.582] HE IS JUST SO CONFIDENT IN WHAT
[ct=3836.230] HE’S DOING, AND MAYBE MORE SO,
[ct=3837.558] WHAT HIS OFFENSIVE LINE IS DOING
[ct=3838.902] FOR HIM.
[ct=3840.295] AND HE’S NOT LOOKING TO RUN.
[ct=3842.928] HE’S ONLY DOING IT WHEN HE HAS
[ct=3842.928] TO.
[ct=3845.555] >> Mike: 39 OUT QUICK.
[ct=3846.877] DeVONTA SMITH’S GOT IT.
[ct=3849.487] SHORT GAIN OF A COUPLE.
[ct=3850.847] THAT IS ELAM, EAGLES’
[ct=3853.564] FIRST-ROUND PICK, TRYING TO HOPE
[ct=3854.900] THAT THE CHANGE OF SCENERY IN
[ct=3858.883] DALLAS WILL CHANGE THE
[ct=3860.190] TRAJECTORY OF YOUR CAREER.
[ct=3861.409] HURTS HAS REALLY HAD TIME TO
[ct=3862.841] READ IT AND THROW.
[ct=3864.190] >> Cris: HE’S DONE A GOOD JOB
[ct=3865.525] TOO.
[ct=3866.774] OBVIOUSLY SCRAMBLING.
[ct=3868.121] BUT HE’S SUCH A COMPLETE
[ct=3868.121] QUARTERBACK.
[ct=3870.839] I HIT ON IT A LITTLE BIT IN THE
[ct=3870.839] FIRST HALF.
[ct=3873.365] BUT TO ME, QUARTERBACKS CONVERT
[ct=3873.365] THIRD DOWNS.
[ct=3874.835] THAT’S WHAT MATTERS ARE AND
[ct=3878.785] AND HE IS JUST A SENSATIONAL --
[ct=3880.051] ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY GOT HIM
[ct=3881.358] INTO THAT PLAYOFF RUN A SEASON
[ct=3885.330] AGO.
[ct=3888.023] >> Mike: 42, BARKLEY TO THE
[ct=3888.023] LEFT.
[ct=3889.343] STRUNG OUT.
[ct=3893.382] BARKLEY WILL GET HIS FIRST DOWN.
[ct=3894.717] SAQUON PAST MIDFIELD.
[ct=3897.325] HE’S NOW IN TERRITORY AT THE 47
[ct=3898.722] GAIN OF 11.
[ct=3902.624] >> Cris: SOMETIMES YOU END UP
[ct=3902.624] HITTING SAQUON BARKLEY AT THE
[ct=3906.627] END OF A RUN, AND YOU JUST
[ct=3908.078] ASSUME HE’S ON THE GROUND AND
[ct=3908.078] HE’S NOT.
[ct=3910.665] I DON’T KNOW EXACTLY WHO IT WAS
[ct=3912.032] CAME UP, MADE THIS HIT, BOOM,
[ct=3913.286] RIGHT THERE.
[ct=3914.657] AND IT WAS HOOKER.
[ct=3915.901] AND YOU JUST THINK THAT HE’S
[ct=3915.901] GOING TO BE ON THE GROUND,
[ct=3917.243] BECAUSE I HIT HIM THAT HARD.
[ct=3921.203] AND HE’S NOT.
[ct=3924.003] >> Mike: ONCE WE GET TO BREAK,
[ct=3925.250] A.J. DILLON, THE FORMER PACKER,
[ct=3926.592] IS IN THE BACKFIELD.
[ct=3929.217] WILL SHIPLEY WAS NOT IN ON THAT
[ct=3930.602] LAST KICKOFF RETURN.
[ct=3931.912] SO IT’S THE FIRST CARRY SINGLE
[ct=3934.521] FOR DILLON, WHO TAKES IT INSIDE
[ct=3935.942] THE FRY AND IS RIGHT AT THE MARK
[ct=3939.933] CLOSE TO A FIRST DOWN AT THE 36
[ct=3942.525] MISSED ALL OF 2024 WITH NECK
[ct=3942.525] INJURY.
[ct=3943.855] STARTED HIS CAREER WITH FOUR
[ct=3945.169] GOOD YEARS IN GREEN BAY.
[ct=3947.825] >> Cris: YEAH, AND YOU GET
[ct=3949.141] SAQUON OUT OF THE LINEUP AND YOU
[ct=3950.555] GO, OH, THAT’S GOOD, GET THAT
[ct=3951.762] BIG GUY OUT OF THERE.
[ct=3954.508] AND THEN IN COME ANOTHER
[ct=3957.160] 250-POUND RUNNING BACK THAT HAS
[ct=3959.743] THIGHS EVEN BIGGER THAN SAQUON
[ct=3961.142] I MEAN, IT’S NUTS.
[ct=3962.522] SIDE BY SIDE IN PRATT OTHER DAY,
[ct=3962.522] IT LOOKED LIKE TWO GUARDS
[ct=3965.119] STANDING NEXT TO EACH OTHER.
[ct=3970.354] >> Mike: SECOND AND SHORT.
[ct=3973.064] HE HAS BEEN TUSH PUSHLESS SO FAR
[ct=3977.021] HERE TONIGHT.
[ct=3982.328] MARKHAM.
[ct=3983.708] GOING TO MOVE THE CHAINS PAST
[ct=3985.069] THE 36 YARD LINE.
[ct=3987.698] FOR A PHILLY FIRST DOWN.
[ct=3990.401] AND AN EAGLE SLOW TO GET UP IS
[ct=3991.614] THE IMPORTANT GUY FOR THEM,
[ct=3993.052] LANDON DICKERSON.
[ct=3995.605] DICKERSON WAS A QUESTION MARK
[ct=4000.902] WITH THE RIGHT KNEE INJURY.
[ct=4000.902] THE DAY HE MISSED WAS BECAUSE OF
[ct=4003.621] A BACK INJURY.
[ct=4007.602] >> Cris: YEAH, HE HAS MENISCUS
[ct=4008.947] SURGERY ON AUGUST 10th.
[ct=4010.326] SO LIKE TWO WEEKS LATER HE WAS
[ct=4011.501] BACK IN THE HUDDLE AND
[ct=4011.501] PRACTICING.
[ct=4015.589] YOU CAN TELL HE IS IN PAIN RIGHT
[ct=4018.232] >> Mike: THE 36.
[ct=4019.590] THAT TIME THEY STOP HIM.
[ct=4022.248] THE SAFETY DONOVAN WILSON
[ct=4022.248] CRASHES OUT.
[ct=4024.902] WE HAVEN’T HAD A CHANCE TO
[ct=4026.207] MENTION ON THE DALLAS FRONT, AS
[ct=4030.115] BARKLEY COMES BACK IN, MAZI
[ct=4031.494] SMITH, THEIR FIRST-ROUND PICK
[ct=4032.863] FROM 2023, INACTIVE.
[ct=4034.176] A HEALTHY SCRATCH HERE TONIGHT
[ct=4036.889] >> Cris: YEAH, IF YOU’RE
[ct=4036.889] INACTIVE WITH WHAT THEY’VE GOT
[ct=4039.519] AT DEFENSIVE TACKLE, THAT’S AS
[ct=4040.843] CLOSE TO BEING CUT AS YOU CAN
[ct=4040.843] BE, RIGHT?
[ct=4043.487] I MEAN, THEY’VE GOT SOLOMON
[ct=4047.503] TOIA.
[ct=4048.794] BUT IT’S QUITE THE STATEMENT
[ct=4048.794] ABOUT YOUR FORMER NUMBER ONE
[ct=4059.529] PICK.
[ct=4060.755] >> Mike: HURTS TO THE AIR.
[ct=4063.487] PRESSURE ON HERE, AND THERE’S
[ct=4064.835] THE FIRST DOWN OF THE SEASON,
[ct=4066.066] AND KENNY CLARK IS INVOLVED IN
[ct=4070.091] IT ALONG WITH MARSHAWN KNEELAND.
[ct=4071.366] CLARK WHO CAME OVER IN THE TRADE
[ct=4072.838] WITH MICAH PARSONS.
[ct=4074.103] KNEELAND ON THE SACK OF HURTS
[ct=4076.765] BACK AT THE 44 YARD LINE.
[ct=4078.003] >> Cris: KNEELAND’S GOING TO BE
[ct=4079.423] THE ONE THAT GETS THERE FIRST.
[ct=4080.804] THEN YOU’RE GOING TO SEE CLARK
[ct=4082.044] COME IN AND CLEAN IT UP.
[ct=4084.688] AND THIS KNEELAND HAS JUST BEEN
[ct=4087.307] PUSHING AND FIGHTING.
[ct=4088.630] AND EVERY TIME -- I STUDIED HIM
[ct=4089.944] FOR QUITE SOME TIME DURING THE
[ct=4091.340] OFFSEASON, BECAUSE WE HAD A LOT
[ct=4092.708] OF TIME, AND GOT A CHANCE TO
[ct=4092.708] WATCH HIM.
[ct=4095.345] WHAT JUST IMPRESSED YOU ABOUT
[ct=4096.690] HIM WAS JUST THE PURE EFFORT,
[ct=4097.964] THAT FOR KENNY CLARK TO ALREADY
[ct=4100.604] BE ON THE MARKER, THEY
[ct=4100.604] DESPERATELY NEEDED THAT.
[ct=4103.239] NOW THEY CANNOT GIVE THIS ONE UP
[ct=4106.001] ON THIRD AND WHATEVER.
[ct=4107.404] >> Mike: HURTS GETS RID OF IT IN
[ct=4113.989] AT THE 40 YARD LINE.
[ct=4116.637] HURTS TOOK A SHOT ON THE EDGE OF
[ct=4116.637] PRESSURE.
[ct=4117.975] FROM HERE, A FIELD GOAL WOULD BE
[ct=4119.376] 58 YARDS.
[ct=4121.938] IT HAS A LITTLE BIT OF WIND WITH
[ct=4123.318] IT, AND THEY’RE GOING TO TRY IT
[ct=4123.318] WITH JAKE ELLIOTT.
[ct=4124.657] >> Cris: YEAH, AND IT’S VERY
[ct=4128.598] RARE THAT YOU SEE JORDAN MAILATA
[ct=4128.598] GET BEAT.
[ct=4132.587] THAT’S A GOOD SIGN FOR THE
[ct=4135.300] DANTE FOWLER, WHO HAD TEN SACKS
[ct=4136.508] A SEASON AGO FOR WASHINGTON.
[ct=4137.873] THIS IS A BIG KICK RIGHT HERE.
[ct=4139.165] DIDN’T REALLY THINK OF JAKE
[ct=4140.524] ELLIOTT AS A LONG-RANGE KICKER.
[ct=4141.909] >> Mike: HE USED TO BE.
[ct=4144.483] LAST YEAR WAS TERRIBLE FROM
[ct=4144.483] 50-PLUS.
[ct=4147.196] HE MADE ONE IN WARMUPS.
[ct=4149.809] THIS IS 58.
[ct=4151.286] IT’S COMING ON AND OFF AND GOOD.
[ct=4153.835] >> Cris: WOW.
[ct=4156.420] >> Mike: EAGLES SPECIAL TEAMS
[ct=4157.822] COORDINATOR MICHAEL BLAKE TOLD
[ct=4159.202] ME THIS WEEK THAT JAKE ELLIOTT’S
[ct=4161.836] GOT HIS SWAGGER BACK.
[ct=4163.160] LOOKS LIKE THE JAKE ELLI
[ct=4164.502] GREEN BAY PACKERS.
[ct=4167.250] THE EAGLES BLINGS POP OUT ON THE
[ct=4167.250] RING.
[ct=4169.861] A VERY COOL-LOOKING PIECE OF
[ct=4173.820] JEWELRY.
[ct=4176.528] FIVE OR SIX TABLE RINGS YOU CAN
[ct=4176.528] SEE FROM FIVE OR SIX TABLES
[ct=4181.774] COLBERT FROM THE 10.
[ct=4185.792] ONE TACKLE COMES FROM THE RIGHT
[ct=4185.792] SIDE.
[ct=4187.179] TAKEN DOWN BY METCHIE, SPECIAL
[ct=4188.473] TEAMS PLAYER.
[ct=4189.775] >> Cris: LET’S TAKE A LOOK AT
[ct=4192.372] THAT SKY CAM BROUGHT TO YOU BY
[ct=4192.372] WALMART.
[ct=4193.765] GOOD CHANCE TO LOOK INSIDE AT
[ct=4195.126] SOME OF THESE OFFENSIVE LINE
[ct=4195.126] HELP.
[ct=4197.699] TYLER BOOKER WAS THE 12th
[ct=4199.111] OVERALL PICK OUT OF ALABAMA.
[ct=4200.430] BOTH THESE TEAMS HAVE NEW RIGHT
[ct=4201.761] GUARDS PLAYING FOR THEM THIS
[ct=4204.422] AND SO FAR, BOOKER’S BEEN
[ct=4204.422] HANGING IN THERE.
[ct=4207.029] YOU KNOW, HE’S KIND OF A BALLER.
[ct=4208.408] HE’S STILL LEARNING, ESPECIALLY
[ct=4209.698] WITH SOME OF THE PASS
[ct=4209.698] PROTECTION.
[ct=4211.004] BUT HE’S DONE A GOOD JOB WITH
[ct=4213.694] THE RUNNING GAME FOR THE MOST
[ct=4213.694] PART TONIGHT.
[ct=4215.030] ALL THE COWBOYS ON OFFENSE AND
[ct=4216.307] ALL THE EAGLES ON OFFENSE,
[ct=4217.632] THEY’VE BEEN DOING A GOOD JO
[ct=4219.064] ALL NIGHT LONG.
[ct=4220.335] >> Mike: I’LL SAY.
[ct=4221.652] EVERY DRIVE HAS LED TO POINTS
[ct=4225.649] FIRST DOWN ROCKING CLEARS SPACE.
[ct=4228.259] JAVONTE WILLIAMS OUT TO THE 35
[ct=4232.310] WILLIAMS OUT 10 CARRIES, 44
[ct=4233.557] YARDS IN HIS DALLAS DEBUT.
[ct=4234.873] >> Cris: ONE OF THE THINGS THE
[ct=4234.873] COWBOYS HAVE FLASHED A LITTLE
[ct=4237.617] BIT TONIGHT IS SOME OF THIS
[ct=4237.617] MOTION.
[ct=4238.934] WATCH THE TIGHT END COME BACK
[ct=4240.174] AND THEN TRAP BACK HERE.
[ct=4242.868] HE’S GONE ACROSS THE FACE OF THE
[ct=4244.265] QUARTERBACK AND THEN COMING BACK
[ct=4246.897] AND JUST RUNNING THAT INSIDE
[ct=4248.243] ZONE BACK AWAY FROM IT.
[ct=4249.600] JUST A LITTLE DIFFERENT LOOK,
[ct=4250.877] AND IT’S PAID OFF FOR THIS
[ct=4254.838] COWBOYS RUNNING BACK.
[ct=4256.122] >> Mike: FOR WILLIAMS.
[ct=4258.808] A COUPLE OF YARDS THERE.
[ct=4260.217] INJURY UPDATE FOR WILLIAMS.
[ct=4261.566] ROY JACKSON, THEIR CORNER, WAS
[ct=4262.847] VALLED FOR CONCUSSION.
[ct=4264.092] WASN’T ON THE FIELD THE END OF
[ct=4265.557] THAT FIRST HALF.
[ct=4265.557] CLEARED.
[ct=4266.791] WAS OUT THERE THE OPENING PLAY
[ct=4268.107] OF THIS DRIVE.
[ct=4270.735] IS NOW BACK ON THE SIDELINE.
[ct=4272.084] STILL WITH HIS HELMET, THOUGH.
[ct=4273.464] >> Cris: THEY’RE DEFINITELY
[ct=4274.733] TRYING TO FIGURE THINGS OUT AT
[ct=4276.092] THAT OTHER CORNERBACK POSITION.
[ct=4280.156] RINGO IS IN THE BATTLE.
[ct=4282.736] JAKORIAN BENNETT IS IN THERE.
[ct=4284.089] I DON’T KNOW THAT THEY’VE EVER
[ct=4285.425] FIRMLY SETTLED ON WHO THE
[ct=4289.336] LONG-TERM ANSWER IS GOING TO BE.
[ct=4290.720] >> Mike: JALEN CUTTER, HE GETS
[ct=4293.333] IN BEFORE THE FIRST SNAP OF THE
[ct=4294.645] GAME.
[ct=4297.352] THIRD SX
[ct=4298.743] THIRD AND 1.
[ct=4298.743] DALLAS WILL PITCH IT.
[ct=4299.999] WILLIAMS GETS THERE.
[ct=4305.390] TOUGH YARDS.
[ct=4306.609] THE FIRST DOWN FOR THE COWBOYS.
[ct=4309.369] >> Cris: WE’RE PLAYING SOME NFC
[ct=4309.369] FOOTBALL RIGHT NOW.
[ct=4311.986] THAT WAS AWESOME.
[ct=4314.629] YOU KNEW THE BIG COLLISION WAS
[ct=4315.959] COMING AT THE END OF THAT ONE,
[ct=4317.207] AND JAVONTE WILLIAMS JUST
[ct=4319.946] LOWERED HIS HEAD AND PLOWED
[ct=4319.946] THROUGH IT FOR THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=4325.212] THAT WAS TERRIFIC.
[ct=4327.954] >> Mike: DALLAS HAS HAD 33 PLAYS
[ct=4335.795] 16 RUSHES, CRIS, 17 PASS TESTS.
[ct=4339.782] SCOTT BRICK LOOKS DOWN THE SEAM.
[ct=4346.484] TRYING TO SQUEEZE IT IN.
[ct=4347.751] THE TIGHT END, GOOD JOB ON THE
[ct=4350.502] ROOKIE BACKER, JOHN CAMPBELL.
[ct=4353.161] GOING BACK WITH INJURY FOR THE
[ct=4355.787] AND SYDNEY BROWN, ONE OF THE
[ct=4357.054] SAFETIES AS THEY TRY TO REPLACE
[ct=4361.072] C.J. GARDNER-JOHNSON’S SPOT.
[ct=4363.819] SO MUCH AMERICAN HISTORY.
[ct=4366.431] SYDNEY BROWN INJURED ON THE LAST
[ct=4367.920] PLAY, BEING LOOKED AT BY THE
[ct=4369.175] TRAINING STAFF ON THE SIDELINE.
[ct=4373.070] ANTHONY ADUBA, THE ROOUK OUT OF
[ct=4374.501] TEXAS, BACK IN THE SAFETY SPOT.
[ct=4375.718] SECOND AND 10.
[ct=4378.418] PRESCOTT GIVES IT.
[ct=4378.418] MILES SANDERS.
[ct=4381.179] SANDERS AT THE 30, THE 20, SPAHN
[ct=4382.438] BRINGS HIM DOWN TO 10.
[ct=4385.134] BUT MILES SANDERS, HIS FIRST
[ct=4389.124] FOUR YEARS AN EAGLE, COMES BACK
[ct=4390.445] IN A BIG ONE FOR 50 YARDS
[ct=4391.644] AGAINST HIS OLD TEAM.
[ct=4393.104] >> Cris: JUST BEAUTIFULLY DONE.
[ct=4395.767] JUST HAVE TO BE PATIENT HERE.
[ct=4398.372] MILES SANDERS JUST WAITS AND
[ct=4398.372] WAITS.
[ct=4399.718] GETS A BIG BLOCK DOWN THE FIELD
[ct=4402.388] THAT REALLY SPRUNG HIM.
[ct=4403.670] THIS WASN’T THE END OF IT.
[ct=4407.627] HE PROBABLY GAVE UP 15 YARDS,
[ct=4407.627] BUT HE HAD A PLAN.
[ct=4408.936] HE WAS GOING TO RUN THEM DOWN
[ct=4410.377] AND PUNCH THIS BALL OUT.
[ct=4413.054] JUST MISSED IT AS SANDERS PULLED
[ct=4414.274] AWAY AT THE LAST SECOND.
[ct=4416.958] >> Mike: OFFICIALLY 49 YARDS.
[ct=4416.958] FIRST AND 10 AT THE 11.
[ct=4421.009] SANDERS REMAINS THE BACK.
[ct=4422.310] HE’S DONE IT AGAIN, INSIDE THIS
[ct=4430.364] >> Cris: HERE COMES THE FLAG.
[ct=4436.926] THE BACK END, PICKENS INVOLVED.
[ct=4438.143] >> Mike: COULDN’T CATCH THE
[ct=4438.143] NUMBER OF THE EAGLE ENGAGED WITH
[ct=4442.196] GEORGE PICKENS.
[ct=4442.196] NEW ADDITION TO THE DALLAS
[ct=4443.544] LINEUP.
[ct=4444.801] THREE TIMES, TWO CATCHES
[ct=4452.982] HERE’S SEAN SMITH.
[ct=4456.880] OFFENSE, NUMBER 3.
[ct=4459.556] UNNECESSARY ROUGHNESS.
[ct=4468.957] >> Cris: A GREAT JOB BY
[ct=4470.182] BLANKENSHIP NOT REACTING.
[ct=4471.567] HE HAD REACTED AND KNOCKED HIM
[ct=4472.908] DOWN, THEY WOULDN’T HAVE GOTTEN
[ct=4476.947] THE BENEFIT OF IT.
[ct=4476.947] SO, TREMENDOUS DISCIPLINE THERE
[ct=4478.393] ON THE PART OF THE EAGLES.
[ct=4478.393] NOT SO MUCH ON THE PART OF
[ct=4485.009] >> Mike: SUM OF LARGE PENALTIES
[ct=4486.409] IN THIS GAME R
[ct=4487.635] START.
[ct=4488.941] TEN TOTAL, SEVEN ON THE EAGLES.
[ct=4491.657] THAT’S THE THIRD ON THE COWBOYS.
[ct=4495.703] NOW BACK THEM UP.
[ct=4497.066] FIRST AND 22.
[ct=4498.400] >> Cris: HAVE TO WORK INSIDE
[ct=4501.096] HERE WITH THIS SHELL COVERAGE.
[ct=4502.386] >> Mike: SCOTT, DOWN THE MIDDLE
[ct=4506.417] FOR THE TIGHT END, AGAIN HE’S
[ct=4507.603] COMPLETE.
[ct=4510.303] TAKING HIM ALL THE WAY BACK WA
[ct=4513.010] WAS ZACK BAUN, THE LINEBACKER.
[ct=4514.348] WOULD NOT LET FERGUSON SEE THE
[ct=4514.348] WALL.
[ct=4515.645] >> Cris: DOUBLE MOVE IS SO HARD
[ct=4516.971] WHEN BAUN IS RIGHT HERE IN THE
[ct=4516.971] MIDDLE.
[ct=4519.663] WATCH THE MOVE IN FRONT OF HIS
[ct=4520.995] FACE, THE DOUBLE MOVE.
[ct=4523.580] GET IN BEHIND.
[ct=4524.986] NOW YOU’VE GOT TO TRY TO FIGURE
[ct=4524.986] IT OUT.
[ct=4528.976] ONLY BECAUSE HIS SPEED NOW TWO
[ct=4528.976] TIMES ON THIS DRIVE HAVE SAVED
[ct=4532.930] BIG PLAYS.
[ct=4536.822] >> Mike: SECOND AND 22.
[ct=4539.600] EAGLES FANS, RISE TO THE END
[ct=4546.186] ZONE TO OUR LEFT.
[ct=4547.560] I DO VONTAE WILLIAMS AND WILL
[ct=4550.319] BRING UP THIRD DOWN.
[ct=4554.194] DEFLECTED.
[ct=4556.906] >> Cris: WE’VE SEEN JIHAAD
[ct=4559.559] CAMPBELL MAKE A FEW PLAYS NOW.
[ct=4560.894] HE HAD TO STOP ON THAT MIDDLE
[ct=4560.894] READ.
[ct=4563.594] LOOKED LIKE THE BIG GUY INSIDE,
[ct=4566.269] JORDAN DAVIS, WHO LOST 36 POUNDS
[ct=4567.537] SO HE COULD PLAY MORE.
[ct=4568.873] HE DIDN’T KNOW HE WAS GOING TO
[ct=4572.835] HAVE TO PLAY AS MUCH AS HE DID
[ct=4575.529] ANOTHER BIG PLAY OUT OF HIM.
[ct=4578.107] HIS OFFSEASON, WE’RE PAYING OFF
[ct=4578.107] WHAT THE EAGLES HAVE.
[ct=4579.480] >> Mike: EAGLES WITH A THREE-MAN
[ct=4583.421] DEFENSIVE FRONT HERE.
[ct=4584.850] COWBOYS IN FRONT OF THEM, THIRD
[ct=4587.470] AND 22.
[ct=4589.997] PRESCOTT GOING TO TRY THE
[ct=4591.409] >> Cris: OH.
[ct=4592.780] >> Mike: A PENALTY AS FERGUSON
[ct=4595.470] GOT HIT BY BLANKENSHIP.
[ct=4603.371] FERGUSON GOT HIS HANDS SWATTED.
[ct=4604.705] FOREARM ACROSS THE HEAD TO A
[ct=4614.035] DEFENSELESS RECEIVER.
[ct=4616.745] ROUGHNESS.
[ct=4616.745] PERSONAL FOUL.
[ct=4620.763] DEFENSE, NUMBER 32.
[ct=4624.636] >> Cris: TWO OF THE BIGGEST
[ct=4627.368] PLAYS OF THIS GAME NOW HAVE BEEN
[ct=4629.978] MENTALLY ON THE EAGLES DEFENDERS
[ct=4632.630] THAT HAVE KEPT DRIVES ALIVE.
[ct=4635.338] THAT CATCH WAS NOT GOING TO BE
[ct=4635.338] MADE.
[ct=4637.996] OF COURSE, BLANKENSHIP HAD NO
[ct=4637.996] IDEA.
[ct=4639.329] HE WAS JUST TRYING TO GET THERE
[ct=4642.044] AND GET CONTACT.
[ct=4643.321] DAK SAYING, HANG IN THERE ACTION
[ct=4643.321] BABY.
[ct=4645.983] BUT YOU KNOW, THIS IS DAK
[ct=4648.649] PRESCOTT BEING REALLY
[ct=4648.649] AGGRESSIVE, TOO.
[ct=4651.434] I MEAN, HE IS NOT SETTLING FOR
[ct=4652.746] ANYTHING.
[ct=4653.985] WHEN THEY BACK UP ON THEIR OWN
[ct=4655.425] 10 YARD LINE AT THE END OF THE
[ct=4658.120] HALF, HE WAS GOING FOR
[ct=4658.120] ELIMINATE.
[ct=4659.355] HERE HE WAS, THIRD AND 20.
[ct=4662.027] LET’S GO, WE’RE
[ct=4663.434] >> Mike: 55 PENALTY YARDS FOR
[ct=4664.713] FROM THE 11 YARD LINE.
[ct=4672.821] PICKED UP BY MITCHELL AND GOT AT
[ct=4675.528] THE 15 YARD LINE.
[ct=4676.819] BIG PLAY ON THE DRIVE TO GET HIM
[ct=4679.511] DOWN THERE FOR SANDERS.
[ct=4684.748] AND THE FORMER EAGLE, A HAND IN
[ct=4687.483] THERE FROM BYRON YOUNG.
[ct=4688.816] FORCES IT OUT, AND MITCHELL
[ct=4688.816] RECOVERS.
[ct=4706.021] THE GAME’S FIRST TURNOVER.
[ct=4707.333] THE HATCHEDS ON THERE, IT FLIES
[ct=4709.989] OUT, CONFIRMED AS A TURNOVER.
[ct=4711.363] FIRST DRIVE WITHOUT POINTS IN
[ct=4712.711] WHOLE STORY, WHAT DAK DID WAS
[ct=4715.277] >> Cris: WHAT JALEN DID WAS A
[ct=4718.037] FOUL.
[ct=4720.623] >> Mike: THE DELAY, 1:05.
[ct=4723.381] WE GET BACK TO WORK.
[ct=4724.708] AND REMEMBER, THE LAST PLAY,
[ct=4726.015] DALLAS WAS DRIVING FOR A
[ct=4731.388] TOUCHDOWN AND A FUMBLE RECOVERY
[ct=4732.738] FOR THE EAGLES.
[ct=4734.016] PHILLY AT FIRST AND 10 OF THEIR
[ct=4735.404] OWN 16.
[ct=4736.715] THEY’VE SCORED ON ALL FOUR
[ct=4738.039] DRIVES THEY’VE HAD TONIGHT.
[ct=4740.723] BARKLEY FROM THE LEFT.
[ct=4743.373] KENNY CLARK AMONG THE GROUP
[ct=4744.628] ALONG WITH JACK SAN BORNE AND
[ct=4748.744] COMPANY IN ON THAT TACKLE.
[ct=4751.293] >> Cris: IS THAT THE FIRST PLAY
[ct=4752.718] THAT WE’VE SEEN THE RUNNING BACK
[ct=4753.985] OF THE PHILADELPHIA EAGLES GET
[ct=4756.662] AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE LIKE
[ct=4757.990] THAT?
[ct=4760.727] I DON’T KNOW WHAT THEY TALKED
[ct=4761.914] ABOUT AT WHATEVER, SECOND
[ct=4763.310] HALFTIME.
[ct=4764.573] THAT WAS A GOOD START.
[ct=4765.958] NOW YOU’VE GOT TO WAKE YOURSELF
[ct=4767.302] THIS IS A BIG GAME.
[ct=4768.544] THIS IS A DIVISIONAL GAME.
[ct=4769.956] SOMEHOW THE COWBOYS COME OUT OF
[ct=4772.590] HERE WITH A WIN, I MEAN, IT’S
[ct=4776.537] FRANCHISE-SHAKING.
[ct=4776.537] >> Mike: BUZZ OUT OF THE
[ct=4779.239] BUILDING AT THE MOMENT,
[ct=4783.279] PRESSURE, PRESCOTT SHIFTS AWAY.
[ct=4785.941] THROWS IT AWAY AT THE LINE OF
[ct=4788.672] BARKLEY AND AN ELIGIBLE RECEIVER
[ct=4789.945] IN THE AREA.
[ct=4792.490] TREVON DIGGS, FORMER COLLEGE
[ct=4793.908] TEAMMATE OF HURTS.
[ct=4796.575] >> Cris: YEAH, RIGHT OFF THE
[ct=4796.575] EDGE.
[ct=4799.260] COME.
[ct=4800.538] ONE OF THE THINGS DALLAS THOUGHT
[ct=4801.892] THEY COULD GET AWAY WITH HERE
[ct=4805.896] WAS IF THEY COULD FORCE JALEN
[ct=4808.528] HURTS TO LOOK AWAY FROM HIS
[ct=4809.825] FIRST TARGET.
[ct=4811.180] THEY WANTED HIM TO PULL THE BALL
[ct=4812.491] DOWN AND FIND NUMBER TWO.
[ct=4813.862] THEY FELT IF THEY COULD DO THAT,
[ct=4815.254] THEY COULD GET PRESSURE ON HIM.
[ct=4816.431] MAYBE NOW THEY HAVE THAT
[ct=4817.845] FORMULA.
[ct=4817.845] BRING SOME PRESSURE ON THE
[ct=4821.892] SECONDARY.
[ct=4823.209] >> Mike: IT’S THIRD AND 11
[ct=4829.913] PRESCOTT GOT AWAY FROM IT.
[ct=4829.913] PRESCOTT, GREAT PURSUIT, DENIES
[ct=4835.136] GREAT PURSUIT, STOPS HIM AT THE
[ct=4836.499] 23 YARD LINE, AND THEY’LL PUNT
[ct=4837.838] IT AWAY.
[ct=4839.198] >> Cris: WELL, WHAT WE’VE SEEN
[ct=4841.764] FROM JALEN HURTS IS THAT HE’S
[ct=4844.459] BEEN MAKING THEM PAY WITH HIS
[ct=4844.459] LEGS.
[ct=4845.792] NOW THEY’RE BRINGING THE BLITZ,
[ct=4847.132] BUT THEY’RE NOT PLAYING MAN
[ct=4848.456] COVERAGE THE WAY THEY WERE IN
[ct=4849.829] THE FIRST HALF.
[ct=4849.829] THEY’RE PLAYING ZONE BEHIND IT.
[ct=4852.363] NOW ON THIRD AND 10, IF HE TAKES
[ct=4853.794] OFF THE RUN, THEY’VE GOT TIME TO
[ct=4857.818] RALLY, MAKE THE TACKLE, AND
[ct=4859.107] FINALLY WE SEE A PUNTER IN THIS
[ct=4860.467] >> Mike: BRADEN MANN, THIRD YEAR
[ct=4863.175] WITH THE EAGLES.
[ct=4864.376] SET TO KICK IT AWAY.
[ct=4865.783] GOOD HANG TIME.
[ct=4869.806] DANGEROUS RETURN.
[ct=4871.122] A GREAT KICK BY MANN.
[ct=4873.783] TURPIN FAIR CATCHES IT AT THE 26
[ct=4876.352] AND THAT’S WHERE NOW DAK
[ct=4879.137] PRESCOTT WILL GET ON THE FIELD
[ct=4881.805] TO TAKE OVER FOR DALLAS.
[ct=4884.304] >> Cris: YEAH, AND I THINK DAK
[ct=4885.744] PRESCOTT IS STARTING TO FEEL
[ct=4887.000] THIS A LITTLE BIT.
[ct=4889.701] IF WE GOT A CHANCE TO COME IN
[ct=4891.051] HERE AND KNOCK OFF THE WORLD
[ct=4892.296] CHAMPS, AND THE BALL’S IN OUR
[ct=4893.764] HANDS RI(QQ Nw:JRUT
[ct=4894.966] HANDS RI(QQ’ w:JRUT
[ct=4894.966] MOVING IT ALL NIGHT.
[ct=4896.363] LET’S GO DOWN AND TAKE THE LEAD
[ct=4897.724] THIS TIME.
[ct=4900.257] NO FUMBLES, NO EXCEPTIONS.
[ct=4901.700] DON’T HAVE ANY HOLDING CALLS.
[ct=4902.989] WE KNOW WE CAN MOVE THE BALL ON
[ct=4906.916] THESE GUYS.
[ct=4909.677] >> Mike: WILLIAMS INSIDE WITH
[ct=4912.266] THE RUN AS THEY KEEP THE PILE
[ct=4913.647] PUSHING FORWARD.
[ct=4916.281] FOUR YARDS AT 30 YARD LINE.
[ct=4917.650] PHYSICALITY FOR THE DALLAS SIDE
[ct=4918.938] IN THE FIRST FOUR SNAPS AFTER
[ct=4922.872] THE DELAY.
[ct=4924.255] >> Cris: IT’S A REALLY GOOD JOB
[ct=4926.935] BY THE OFFENSIVE LINE JUST
[ct=4928.250] GETTING IN BEHIND WILLIAMS AND
[ct=4928.250] KEEPING THAT PLAY ALIVE.
[ct=4929.597] WE’VE SEEN THAT A COUPLE OF
[ct=4930.843] TIMES HERE TONIGHT.
[ct=4932.136] >> Mike: NOT THE TUSH PUSH.
[ct=4934.876] THE COWBOYS GETTING IT DONE WITH
[ct=4937.490] THREE GUYS NAME TYLER.
[ct=4938.779] ALL FIRST-ROUND PICKS.
[ct=4940.167] ALL ON THAT OFFENSIVE FRONT FOR
[ct=4944.223] DALLAS.
[ct=4946.804] THIS PLAY MAY DETERMINE WHAT THE
[ct=4949.397] COWBOYS’ SEASON IS LIKE.
[ct=4950.798] PRESCOTT GOT IT AWAY.
[ct=4953.460] ONLY A GAIN OF IF OF YARDS.
[ct=4957.365] AND THE SAFETY ANDREW McCUNE WAS
[ct=4958.812] THERE TO MAKE THE STOP.
[ct=4960.102] THIRD AND 1 COMING U
[ct=4961.450] >> Cris: COMING OFF THE EDGE
[ct=4968.117] YET WASN’T ABLE TO GET THERE.
[ct=4969.394] BUT I TELL YOU, THE WAY THIS
[ct=4970.750] GAME IS GOING RIGHT NOW, I’VE
[ct=4972.086] GOT TO THINK THIS IS PROBABLY
[ct=4973.343] FOUR-DOWN TERRITORY FOR THE
[ct=4974.678] THEY’VE BEEN RUNNING IT VERY
[ct=4987.941] >> Mike: IN THE GUN, AND THEY’VE
[ct=4989.302] ESSENTIALLY GOT THE BACKFIELD
[ct=4990.597] EMPTIED OUT.
[ct=4995.989] LAMB’S GOT THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=4995.989] CEEDEE WILL TAKE TO IT THE 49
[ct=4997.196] BRING HIM DOWN, BUT IT’S A FIRST
[ct=5000.055] DOWN FOR DALLAS.
[ct=5002.651] >> Cris: GREAT JOB AS THEY BRING
[ct=5002.651] PRESSURE HERE.
[ct=5003.899] THAT’S AN EASY THROW TO GET IN
[ct=5007.942] FOR DAK PRESCOTT.
[ct=5010.548] AND DECIDED TO THROW A LITTLE
[ct=5011.832] PRESSURE BACK AT DAK ON THAT
[ct=5013.233] ONE, AND IT JUST BLEW UP IN HIS
[ct=5014.477] FACE.
[ct=5014.477] THAT’S THE SECOND OR THIRD TIME
[ct=5017.163] TONIGHT WE HAVE SEEN THE EAGLES,
[ct=5019.831] WHO DIDN’T BLITZ A WHOLE LOT
[ct=5022.506] BUT NOW THEY’RE ALMOST BEING
[ct=5025.145] FORCED INTO IT WITHOUT JALEN
[ct=5025.145] CARTER, SOME OF THE GUYS THEY
[ct=5030.599] HAD ON THIS TEAM A YEAR AGO.
[ct=5039.884] >> Mike: WILLIAMS TO THE 8 YARD
[ct=5039.884] LINE, A PICKUP OF ABOUT THR
[ct=5041.135] THE FINAL MINUTE OF THIS THIRD
[ct=5041.135] QUARTER.
[ct=5042.475] >> Cris: YEAH, THE COWBOYS HAVE
[ct=5042.475] SPENT A LOT OF RESOU
[ct=5043.754] OFFENSIVE LINE.
[ct=5045.126] TYLER GUYTON, NUMBER ONE PICK.
[ct=5046.490] TYLER SMITH, NUMBER ONE PICK.
[ct=5047.769] CEEDEE, THIRD ROUND.
[ct=5049.130] TYLER BOOKER, NUMBER ONE PICK.
[ct=5050.486] THEY ARE TRYING TO GO BACK TO
[ct=5053.150] THE DAYS OF THE DALLAS COWBOYS
[ct=5055.795] WHEN THEY COULD TURN AROUND AND
[ct=5057.073] HAND THE FOOTBALL TO EMMITT
[ct=5062.452] SMITH AND LET HIM GO TO WORK.
[ct=5070.545] THEY’VE BEEN ABLE TO DO IT.
[ct=5071.817] >> Mike: SET IT UP FOR CEEDEE
[ct=5073.133] LAMB.
[ct=5073.133] HE’S GOT SOME BLOCKING ON
[ct=5075.788] PHILADELPHIA ALL OVER THAT.
[ct=5077.172] TURNS IT INTO A LOSS.
[ct=5079.823] JORDAN DAVIS, WHO’S HAD TO PLAY
[ct=5079.823] A LOT IN THIS ONE, COMES UP WITH
[ct=5081.061] THE STOP.
[ct=5083.770] THAT WILL MAKE IT THIRD AND 10
[ct=5083.770] FOR THE START OF QUARTER NUMBER
[ct=5089.115] FOUR.
[ct=5091.701] ONLY SCORING A PHILADELPHIA
[ct=5097.107] FIELD GOAL, HOUR WEATHER DELAY.
[ct=5099.645] WE GO INTO THE FOURTH WITH A
[ct=5102.439] TIGHT GAME.N.
[ct=5103.683] WE WELCOME YOU BACK TO "THE NFL
[ct=5106.349] KICKOFF" PRESENTED BY YOUTUBE
[ct=5107.690] TV, BEGINNING QUARTER NUMBER
[ct=5110.389] FOUR WITH THE COWBOYS FACING
[ct=5110.389] THIRD AND 10, DOWN FOUR TO THE
[ct=5118.397] IT IS COMPLETE.
[ct=5122.292] A LOT OF TRAFFIC IN THERE.
[ct=5123.688] THEY CANNOT CONNECT.
[ct=5125.043] AND DALLAS WILL PUNCH IT AWAY
[ct=5128.928] FOR THE FIRST TIME.
[ct=5130.370] >> Cris: TURPIN GOT JAMMED AT
[ct=5131.650] THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE, AND SO HE
[ct=5134.414] WAS UNABLE TO CLEAR THE SPACE IN
[ct=5136.942] THE MIDDLE FOR CEEDEE LAMB.
[ct=5138.290] JUST GOOD DEFENSE, NOT GIVING
[ct=5138.290] THE FREE RELEASE.
[ct=5140.895] HE WAS JAMMED UP FRONT, BUT THEN
[ct=5143.673] IT JUST FORCED A LOT OF BODIES
[ct=5146.321] INTO THAT AREA WHERE CEEDEE WAS
[ct=5147.524] COMING, IT WENT RIGHT THROUGH
[ct=5147.524] HIS HANDS.
[ct=5151.581] >> Mike: FIRST KICK FOR BRYAN
[ct=5151.581] ANGER.
[ct=5154.302] JAHAN DOTSON BACK TO HANDLE THE
[ct=5159.587] PUNT.
[ct=5162.198] SIGNALS FOUR, MAKES
[ct=5167.482] >> Mike: A.J. BROWN’S ABOUT TO
[ct=5170.179] JOIN THE PHILADELPHIA HUDDLE.
[ct=5171.508] 42 PLAYS RUN FOR EAGLES.
[ct=5174.176] BROWN HAS NOT BEEN TARGETED YET
[ct=5176.811] HE’S NOT HAD A GAME WHERE HE HAS
[ct=5179.534] HAD ZERO TARGETS.
[ct=5182.132] 13 OF 16 IN THE AIR, BUT 6 OF
[ct=5187.484] THOSE 13 COMPLETIONS TO DALLAS
[ct=5188.709] GOEDERT, HIS TIGHT END.
[ct=5190.039] >> Cris: WE HAVE SEEN SAQUON
[ct=5191.469] BARKLEY IN THE SECOND HALF IN
[ct=5192.799] PARTICULAR THE FOURTH QUARTER OF
[ct=5195.434] GAMES, JUST HAVING POUNDED ALL
[ct=5199.397] NIGHT LONG, BREAK SOME BIG RUNS
[ct=5199.397] AND WIN FOOTBALL GAMES FOR THE
[ct=5203.399] >> Mike: SPREAD OUT HERE TO THE
[ct=5206.058] HURTS LOOKS RIGHT.
[ct=5206.058] COVERS.
[ct=5208.735] COMES BACK TO BARKLEY.
[ct=5211.385] TO THE 20 YARD LINE.
[ct=5214.047] KAIIR ELAM DOWN THERE.
[ct=5216.704] >> Melissa: DEFENSIVE PLAYERS,
[ct=5217.987] WHEN THEY WERE COMING BACK ONTO
[ct=5245.878] I THINK THAT’S WHAT THE PLAYERS
[ct=5251.329] WERE TALKING ABOUT.
[ct=5252.500] >> Mike: SECOND AND 2.
[ct=5255.252] INSIDE WAS BARKLEY, AND AGAIN
[ct=5257.844] TIED UP WITH MARSHAWN ELAM.
[ct=5259.176] THAT SECOND-ROUND PICK OUT OF
[ct=5261.840] WESTERN MICHIGAN IN HIS SECOND
[ct=5264.569] BEEN AROUND IT A LOT TONIGHT.
[ct=5265.854] >> Cris: HE SURE HAS, AND THAT
[ct=5275.255] SHOWS UP AS WELL.
[ct=5285.755] YOU’RE EXPECTING BIG THINGS.
[ct=5288.527] >> Mike: THIRD AND 1.
[ct=5293.832] >> GO, GO, GO!
[ct=5297.814] >> Mike: MOVES TOWARD THE LINE.
[ct=5300.499] AND THE INITIAL INDICATION FROM
[ct=5301.764] THE DOWN JUDGE, JAY BILBO, IS TO
[ct=5304.554] MOVE THE CHAINS FOR A FIRST
[ct=5307.228] DOWN.
[ct=5315.142] EAGLES INTERIOR LINEMEN.
[ct=5316.502] >> Cris: THERE’S THE FOUR GUYS.
[ct=5317.837] THE STRATEGY FOR THE COWBOYS WAS
[ct=5320.510] TO COME AROUND HERE AND KNOCK
[ct=5323.149] OFF THESE TWO PUSHERS AND PULL
[ct=5327.042] BACKWARDS ON THE LEGS OF HURTS.
[ct=5328.457] DIDN’T WORK THAT TIME.
[ct=5331.133] >> Mike: AND WE HAVE A FLAG
[ct=5333.692] A COUPLE OF THEM IN THE
[ct=5339.105] PROBABLY TOO MANY COWBOYS.
[ct=5339.105] >> Referee: 12 PLAYER
[ct=5341.761] FIVE-YARD PENALTY.
[ct=5351.032] >> Mike: SO ALMOST STOPPING
[ct=5352.450] GROUND.
[ct=5353.789] NOW THEY’LL HAVE FIRST AND SHORT
[ct=5355.111] TO OPERATE WITH.
[ct=5356.415] HERE STARTING THIS FOURTH
[ct=5362.961] COWBOYS HAVE HAD SOME CHANCES.
[ct=5364.410] >> Cris: THEY HAD POSSESSION
[ct=5365.694] WITH A CHANCE TO GO TAKE THE
[ct=5365.694] LEAD.
[ct=5367.102] AS GREAT AS THEY PLAYED IN THE
[ct=5368.334] FIRST HALF ON OFFENSE, WE
[ct=5371.163] HAVEN’T SEEN MUCH HERE SINCE.
[ct=5372.472] >> Mike: THE FIRST AND 5 FOR
[ct=5373.800] JALEN HURTS.
[ct=5380.481] AND BARKLEY.
[ct=5383.162] A YARD SHY OF FIRST DOWN, LOOKS
[ct=5384.406] LIKE THE MARK WILL BE AT THE 32
[ct=5390.947] >> Cris: I REMEMBER THE EAGLES
[ct=5395.074] IN THIS GAME, VAN SUMEREN, THEIR
[ct=5396.305] FULLBACK, REALLY WAS KNOCKED OUT
[ct=5397.727] ON THE FIRST OPENING KICKOFF.
[ct=5400.346] SO THEY’RE HAVING TO ADJUST.
[ct=5401.642] NOW THEY’VE GOT GRANTSON IN
[ct=5403.049] THERE PLAYING SOME FULLBACK
[ct=5404.336] BECAUSE THEY WANT TO GO WITH
[ct=5405.604] SOME POWER FOOTBALL.
[ct=5406.996] >> Mike: THE NUMBER THAT WAS
[ct=5409.677] JUST UP TO THAT YOU ALLUDED TO,
[ct=5410.912] SAQUON WITH ALL THE SUCCESS,
[ct=5413.643] OVER 2,000 YARDS LAST YEAR,
[ct=5416.236] 2,005, DOING A LOT OF IT AFTER
[ct=5418.963] THERE HE IS AGAIN.
[ct=5421.665] DALLAS IS GETTING ON THAT OTHER
[ct=5422.832] SIDE OF THE OFFENSIVE LINE SINCE
[ct=5424.260] THE WEATHER STOPPAGE.
[ct=5425.578] >> Cris: YEAH, AND I THINK WHAT
[ct=5428.250] WE’RE SEEING IS JUST SOME STUNTS
[ct=5430.956] AND SOME PLAY INSIDE.
[ct=5433.547] YOU COULD TELL SOME OF THESE
[ct=5434.837] GUYS, IT’S BASICALLY SOLOMON
[ct=5436.215] THOMAS THERE JUST ON THE STUNTS,
[ct=5438.874] SPUN IN, FLUSHED BACK OUT, AND
[ct=5440.133] WAS ABLE TO MAKE THE PLAY.
[ct=5441.519] THE PROBLEM IS, YOU THINK YOUR
[ct=5445.403] CHANCES OF STOPPING THIS TUSH
[ct=5445.403] PUSH, ALMOST ZERO.
[ct=5446.745] LET’S SEE AGAIN.
[ct=5448.077] THEY’RE GOING TO FLY OFF THE
[ct=5450.855] EDGES AND TRY TO GET THE LEG OF
[ct=5452.152] JALEN HURTS AFTER THEY WHACK
[ct=5458.824] THOSE TWO PUSHERS.
[ct=5462.754] >> Mike: SECOND PUSH.
[ct=5462.754] HURTS TAKES THEM TO THE FIRST
[ct=5465.321] DOWN AT THE 33 YARD LINE.
[ct=5469.419] AGAIN, THE VOTE IS 24 VOTES
[ct=5470.734] NEEDED TO GET IT OUT OF THE
[ct=5473.375] THE VOTE WAS 22-10 AT THE LEAGUE
[ct=5474.741] MEETINGS.
[ct=5477.291] >> Cris: AND WHAT IS MIKE TYSON,
[ct=5478.680] EVERYBODY HAS A PLAN TILL YOU
[ct=5480.045] GET HIT IN THE MOUTH?
[ct=5480.045] >> Mike: THAT’S IT.
[ct=5482.739] >> Cris: KIND OF WHAT THE TUSH
[ct=5483.957] PUSH DOES FOR YOU.
[ct=5485.356] IT’S HUMILIATING.
[ct=5487.979] FOR THE DALLAS COWBOYS, DEFENSES
[ct=5489.231] HATE IT WHEN THEY CAN’T STOP THE
[ct=5489.231] RUN.
[ct=5490.609] I’M TELLING YOU, IT
[ct=5491.944] THEM.
[ct=5493.324] RIGHT NOW THE PHILADELPHIA
[ct=5494.585] EAGLES ARE TRYING TO JUST PUNCH
[ct=5497.208] THEM TIME AND TIME AGAIN, AND
[ct=5498.588] THAT’S HOW THEY WIN FOOTBALL
[ct=5498.588] GAMES.
[ct=5499.921] ESPECIALLY LATE.
[ct=5505.378] >> Mike: FIRST DOWN WITH THE
[ct=5506.658] TUSH PUSH, DeVONTA SMITH NOT
[ct=5513.297] >> Melissa: JORDAN MAILATA TOLD
[ct=5514.691] ME HIS FEELINGS WERE SPLIT 50/50
[ct=5517.348] IF THE TUSH PUSH WASN’T BANNED
[ct=5518.619] SAYING, I WANT TO RUN IT BUT AT
[ct=5521.278] THE SAME TIME, I DON’T, BECAUSE
[ct=5522.629] IT’S REALLY HARD.
[ct=5525.201] RUNNING IT TWO, THREE, FOUR
[ct=5526.557] TIMES A GAME IS TAXING, HE SAID.
[ct=5529.214] HAVE THE CAMERAS ZOOM IN ON MY
[ct=5530.596] FACE THE FIFTH TIME, YOU’LL SEE
[ct=5530.596] MY EXCITEMENT.
[ct=5533.203] >> Mike: WE’VE GOT THREE TO GO.
[ct=5533.203] RUN IT TWICE.
[ct=5535.965] GOT IT BOTH TIMES.
[ct=5537.139] SECOND AND 3.
[ct=5538.535] OFF THE EDGE.
[ct=5542.539] OH, BARKLEY THE RUNNING CATCH.
[ct=5543.755] BECOME BARKLEY THE STIFF-ARM.
[ct=5543.755] BARKLEY THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=5549.170] OFFENSIVE PLAYER OF THE YEAR.
[ct=5550.605] ON FULL DAYS PLAY.
[ct=5551.879] >> Cris: ALSO VOTED THE NUMBER
[ct=5553.265] ONE PLAYER ON THAT PLAYER’S
[ct=5554.754] POLL.
[ct=5555.957] LOOK AT THE ONE-HANDED CATCH
[ct=5557.193] HERE COMING ACROSS IN THE
[ct=5557.193] BACKFIELD.
[ct=5558.496] REACHES OUT THAT ONE HAND, M
[ct=5561.132] WASN’T ENOUGH.
[ct=5562.460] GOT A CHIP.
[ct=5562.460] HANDLED THAT.
[ct=5563.836] MAKE SOMEBODY MISS.
[ct=5566.446] >> Mike: HE IS SO GOOD.
[ct=5571.761] SO GOOD.
[ct=5574.440] CAUGHT BEHIND THE LINE OF
[ct=5578.505] GREAT READ BY JAMES HOUSTON WITH
[ct=5581.089] THE LIONS, HAD A GREAT RUN OF
[ct=5581.089] SACKS BACK IN 2022.
[ct=5585.100] WASN’T ABLE TO STAY HEALTHY OR
[ct=5586.403] BE IMPACTFUL AS AN EDGE RUSHER.
[ct=5587.746] MADE A GOOD PLAY THERE FOR A
[ct=5587.746] LOSS.
[ct=5589.010] >> Cris: THIS GUY HAD EIGHT
[ct=5591.682] SACKS IN SEVEN GAMES AS A
[ct=5591.682] ROOKIE.
[ct=5594.419] AND WATCH HIM GO INSIDE THE
[ct=5596.998] BLOCK THERE OF MAILATA.
[ct=5598.342] AND THEN STILL ENOUGH SPEED TO
[ct=5599.629] GET OUT AND MAKE THAT PLAY.
[ct=5603.638] THAT’S WHAT THEY SAID, MIKE.
[ct=5604.973] THEY FEET LIKE THE GREATEST
[ct=5606.340] DEPTH THEY HAD ON THE TEAM WAS
[ct=5607.700] AT THE EDGE.
[ct=5610.347] AND SO MAYBE THEY COULD SURVIVE
[ct=5611.662] WITHOUT MICAH PARSONS.
[ct=5614.356] I’M NOT SURE THEY’D MAKE THE
[ct=5615.590] SAME ARGUMENT AFTER THIS ONE,
[ct=5616.951] ALTHOUGH THAT ONE HELPED.
[ct=5618.201] >> Mike: PLAY CLOCK WAS RUNNING
[ct=5624.877] >> Mike: IT’S USUALLY JIMMY
[ct=5626.185] FALLON TIME RIGHT NOW.
[ct=5627.560] WE’LL GET TO HIM AFTER YOUR
[ct=5627.560] LOCAL NEWS.
[ct=5630.267] SO BARKLEY’S ON THE SIDELINE FOR
[ct=5631.514] A MOMENT.
[ct=5632.883] LANDON DICKERSON, THE PRO BOWL
[ct=5634.154] LEFT GUARD, IS ALSO OUT OF THE
[ct=5638.128] GAME FOR THE MOMENT FOR
[ct=5639.498] BRENT TOTH IS IN THERE AT GUARD
[ct=5642.111] FOR DICKERSON, WHO HAD A KNEE
[ct=5643.523] THEN ALSO WAS ON THEIR INJURY
[ct=5647.532] REPORT WITH A BACK.
[ct=5648.867] THIS WEEK.
[ct=5650.190] SECOND AND 14 FOR HURTS.
[ct=5654.149] UP AND OPEN.
[ct=5654.149] HURTS ESCAPES.
[ct=5656.862] CHASED BY WILLIAMS.
[ct=5659.471] AND CLOSE IT TO THE B
[ct=5660.823] INPAMPHLET.
[ct=5663.463] >> Melissa: BEFORE THE WEATHER
[ct=5664.819] DELAY, LANDON DICKERSON CAME OFF
[ct=5667.509] THE FIELD, GRIMACING IN A TON OF
[ct=5667.509] PAIN.
[ct=5670.064] THE ATHLETIC TRAINER AND
[ct=5671.440] ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON WERE LOOKING
[ct=5671.440] AT HIS LOWER BACK.
[ct=5674.082] THEY USED A MASSAGE GUN.
[ct=5674.082] HE NEVER SAT DOWN.
[ct=5676.759] HE ONLY PRACTICED TWO TIMES THIS
[ct=5676.759] WEEK BECAUSE OF THAT BACK.
[ct=5679.411] AFTER THE WEATHER DELAY, HE DID
[ct=5680.787] NOT PARTICIPATE IN THOSE WARMUPS
[ct=5682.071] THAT THEY HAD ON THE FIELD.
[ct=5684.794] HE WAS STRETCHING ON THE SIDE.
[ct=5684.794] SO CERTAINLY THIS IS SOMETHING
[ct=5686.067] THAT’S BOTHERING HIM.
[ct=5687.385] >> Mike: THE IMPORTANT PIECE OF
[ct=5690.090] THAT OFFENSIVE LINE, HEADING
[ct=5692.805] BIG DOM, ATHLETIC TRAINING
[ct=5694.005] STAFF, PHILLY PERSONNEL.
[ct=5695.411] BIG THIRD DOWN HERE WITH 8:18 TO
[ct=5707.424] HE GOES FOR IT.
[ct=5708.796] TREVON DIGGS OVER THERE AS WELL
[ct=5710.120] AT MIDFIELD.
[ct=5712.730] HURTS LOOKING OVER THE SIDELINE
[ct=5714.006] WITH FOURTH AND 4.
[ct=5716.724] AND WILL THEY GO?
[ct=5717.979] >> Cris: WITH THE WAY THESE
[ct=5719.382] OFFENSES HAVE BEEN GOING, NOT IN
[ct=5721.993] THE SECOND HALF BUT BEFORE, YOU
[ct=5723.332] CERTAINLY ARE AT LEAST GOING TO
[ct=5724.692] GO HARD-COUNT HERE AND SEE WHAT
[ct=5726.027] HAPPENS.
[ct=5726.027] BUT I THINK THEY’RE ACTUALLY
[ct=5730.003] GOING FOR IT.
[ct=5731.282] I DON’T THINK YOU WANT DALLAS
[ct=5732.667] HAVING THE BALL WITH SEVEN
[ct=5733.957] MINUTES TO GO AND A CHANCE TO GO
[ct=5748.525] WIN THE GAME FOR THEIR OFFENSE.
[ct=5749.934] AND THERE IS THE DELAY OF GAME.
[ct=5752.522] >> Referee: DELAY OF GAME.
[ct=5755.199] FOURTH DOWN.
[ct=5755.199] >> Mike: NOW THEY’LL TRY TO PIN
[ct=5759.198] THEM WITH THE PUNT.
[ct=5760.554] SO INTERESTING, AFTER NOBODY
[ct=5763.190] COULD BE STOPPED WITH ALL THE
[ct=5764.479] SCORES EVERY POSSESSION IN THAT
[ct=5765.822] FIRST HALF, WE HAD THE FIELD
[ct=5767.158] GOAL TO START THE SECOND HALF
[ct=5768.477] AND NOTHING SINCE.
[ct=5772.486] AND BRADEN MANN TRYING TO PLAY
[ct=5776.472] KEEP-AWAY WITH KaVONTAE TURPIN.
[ct=5777.781] THE UBER-DANGEROUS RETURN MAN
[ct=5780.450] FOR THE COWBOYS.
[ct=5791.164] >> Mike: WOBBLER, TOUGH TO
[ct=5793.714] TURPIN CAN’T GET HIS HANDS ON
[ct=5797.689] SO WELL DONE BY BRADEN MANN.
[ct=5810.902] PARK FOR THE BILLS AND THE
[ct=5812.411] RAVENS.
[ct=5813.631] THE LATEST VERSION OF SUNDAY
[ct=5814.969] NIGHT WITH CARRIE UNDERWOOD.
[ct=5816.260] YEAR 13 OF HER DOING THAT.
[ct=5818.935] LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING THAT.
[ct=5820.273] RIGHT BEFORE KICKOFF OF THE
[ct=5825.620] BILLS AND RAVENS ON NBC.
[ct=5829.591] PRESCOTT GOING TO 11.
[ct=5829.591] CEEDEE LAMB HAVING A NIGHT.
[ct=5830.877] RIGHT AROUND THE 23 AS L
[ct=5832.245] CATCHES HIS SEVENTH OF THE
[ct=5832.245] EVENING.
[ct=5833.571] >> Cris: YEAH, WE MIGHT BE
[ct=5834.891] GETTING SOME ENTERTAINING ACTION
[ct=5836.232] GOING ON DOWN THERE NOW.
[ct=5837.542] BECAUSE WE’RE SEEING CEEDEE
[ct=5840.215] MATCHED UP ONE ON ONE AGAINST
[ct=5841.539] QUINYON MITCHELL.
[ct=5842.894] THOSE ARE TWO OF THE REALLY
[ct=5844.169] TOP-END PLAYERS IN THE LEAGUE.
[ct=5844.169] LET’S SEE HOW MUCH THEY STAY
[ct=5853.452] WITH THAT.
[ct=5857.483] >> Mike: FROM THE 24, WILLIAMS
[ct=5864.111] THE PRESSURE ERASES ANY HOPE.
[ct=5870.741] WITH THE PENETRATION.
[ct=5872.110] >> Cris: YOU SEE HUNT JUST JUMP
[ct=5873.382] RIGHT INSIDE THE BLOCK HERE AND
[ct=5874.775] BE ABLE TO MAKE THAT PLAY I
[ct=5877.397] THAT WAS REALLY BIG, BECAUSE IT
[ct=5878.754] WAS STARTING TO FEEL LIKE DALLAS
[ct=5881.373] MIGHT HAVE A LITTLE SOMETHING
[ct=5881.373] GOING.
[ct=5884.139] PUTTING THE BALL BACK IN THE
[ct=5885.345] HANDS OF DAK NOW.
[ct=5888.017] AND REALLY FEEL LIKE THESE
[ct=5888.017] RECEIVERS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO
[ct=5890.653] GO WIN THE FOOTBALL GAME FOR
[ct=5890.653] DALLAS IF THEY’RE GOING TO GET
[ct=5896.036] IT DONE.
[ct=5897.287] >> Mike: PRIVILEGE FIN, A
[ct=5898.663] ONE-PLAN MISS, BUT NO MORE THAN
[ct=5901.347] THEY WERE WAITING FOR HIM.
[ct=5902.684] MUKUBA, THE SAFETY.
[ct=5905.330] CAMPBELL, THE ROOKIE LINEBACKER.
[ct=5906.693] THE FIRST AND SECOND-ROUND PICKS
[ct=5907.967] COMBINE THERE FOR PHILLY.
[ct=5909.270] >> Cris: ONCE AGAIN, IT’S THE
[ct=5910.560] IT HAS BEEN THE DIFFERENCE,
[ct=5915.940] REALLY, IN THIS HALF.
[ct=5918.585] NICK BANJO HAS CONSISTENTLY BEEN
[ct=5918.585] BRINGING PRESSURE.
[ct=5921.195] DAK HAD TO GET RID OF IT.
[ct=5925.263] NOW THEY’RE IN THIRD AND LONG.
[ct=5926.557] REALLY FLIPPED THIS GAME HERE IN
[ct=5933.151] CEEDEE LAMB IS STANDING ON THE
[ct=5939.918] END.
[ct=5942.448] AND DAK, HE’S PRESSURED AGAIN.
[ct=5943.765] THROWS IT.
[ct=5945.170] WILLIAMS.
[ct=5947.774] THREE EAGLES ARE THERE.
[ct=5949.134] AND AFTER A FIRST DOWN ON THE
[ct=5950.470] FIRST PLAY, PHILADELPHIA’S
[ct=5953.126] DEFENSE STEPS UP AND DALLAS WILL
[ct=5954.409] PUNCH IT AWAY.
[ct=5957.086] >> Cris: YEAH, AND THAT TIME, NO
[ct=5958.431] GOOD.
[ct=5959.706] THIS IS JUST A FOUR-MAN PRESSURE
[ct=5961.065] UP HERE.
[ct=5963.715] THIS COWBOYS OFFENSIVE LINE HAS
[ct=5963.715] TO BE ABLE TO HOLD UP.
[ct=5966.422] THAT WAS A FAIRLY SIMPLE STUNT.
[ct=5967.702] THE ROOKIE, TYLER BOOKER, WAS
[ct=5969.053] LATE GETTING OFF TO MAKE THE
[ct=5971.704] PLAY AND SIMPLY FORCED DAK TO
[ct=5973.090] THROW IT AWAY SOONER THAN HE
[ct=5975.644] WANTED TO.
[ct=5977.043] >> Mike: BRYAN ANGER KICKED TO
[ct=5985.022] JAHAN DOTSON.
[ct=5987.705] IS HANG TIME HERE.
[ct=5990.463] ATTEMPTS A 48 YARD.
[ct=5994.362] >> Mike: 4:43 TO GO AS WE COME
[ct=5997.051] ACROSS MIDNIGHT HERE IN
[ct=5998.387] PHILADELPHIA WITH THAT 64-MINUTE
[ct=5999.642] WEATHER DELAY.
[ct=6002.350] COWBOYS HAVE NOT SCORED IN THIS
[ct=6006.301] SECOND HALF AS JERRY JONES AND
[ct=6009.023] THE COWBOYS LOOK TO GET A ROAD
[ct=6010.232] VICTORY IN THIS OPENER AGAINST
[ct=6011.630] THE DEFENDING CHAMPION EAGLES.
[ct=6012.925] THE TEAM SITTING THERE AS WELL.
[ct=6014.267] PHILADELPHIA FROM THE 24 YARD
[ct=6022.263] BARKLEY AS THE BACK OF THE
[ct=6024.900] INSIDE RUN, SHUT DOWN HERE IN
[ct=6026.302] THIS SECOND HALF.
[ct=6028.927] ADD THE ABSENCE OF DICKERSON TO
[ct=6028.927] THAT NOW.
[ct=6032.892] >> Cris: MAN, LOOK AT ALL THE
[ct=6032.892] DEFENDERS.
[ct=6034.192] THE THAT IS COWBOYS, THEY’RE
[ct=6036.827] JUST GOING TO TAKE AWAY SAQUO
[ct=6038.153] LOOK AT THIS.
[ct=6040.852] THE NUMBER OF BODIES.
[ct=6042.180] THEY’RE ALL FLYING ACROSS THE
[ct=6043.525] LINE OF SCRIMMAGE.
[ct=6044.908] DON’T FORGET NOW THAT BRETT TOTH
[ct=6046.159] IS IN THERE PLAYING THE OTHER
[ct=6047.459] GUARD POSITION.
[ct=6048.856] IF YOU’RE GOING TO ATTACK AND
[ct=6050.142] MAYBE CONFUSE THE GROUP THAT
[ct=6051.474] HASN’T BEEN IN THERE TOGETHER,
[ct=6054.063] YOU MIGHT RATHER ATTACK INSIDE
[ct=6060.762] RIGHT NOW RATHER THAN THE EDGES.
[ct=6063.491] >> Mike: HURTS’ FIRST LOOK.
[ct=6064.765] COVERAGE.
[ct=6064.765] ESCAPING LEFT.
[ct=6067.441] HE GOES OUT OF BOUNDS AS WELL.
[ct=6070.028] PUSHED DOWN ON THE SIDELINE.
[ct=6071.377] WILLIAMS WAS IN PURSUIT.
[ct=6072.741] LOOKED LIKE THE HAND WAS ON HIM
[ct=6074.051] BEFORE HE GOT TO THE WHITE OF
[ct=6076.750] THE SIDELINE.
[ct=6081.990] THIRD DOWN COMING.
[ct=6081.990] >> Cris: GOOD CALL.
[ct=6083.327] AND THEY NEED A GOOD
[ct=6084.674] HERE, TOO.
[ct=6085.930] THIS IS THE BIGGEST PLAY OF THE
[ct=6089.967] NOT OFTEN YOU GET THIS OFFENSE
[ct=6091.285] BACK UP LIKE THIS.
[ct=6093.917] AND WHAT WE SAW IN THE FIRST
[ct=6096.563] HALF IS WHEN THIS HAPPENS, WE
[ct=6099.247] GOT THE SCRAMBLE, AND WE GOT
[ct=6101.962] JALEN HURTS OUT MAKING PLAYS.
[ct=6103.248] JOB ONE NOW IS, DON’T LET HIM
[ct=6108.550] ESCAPE.
[ct=6109.938] >> Mike: FOUR IN THE PATTERN.
[ct=6112.513] THERE’S THE FLUSH.
[ct=6116.522] IT IS CAUGHT.
[ct=6121.881] DOTSON HIT AT THE 30.
[ct=6124.532] ELAM IN HIS COWBOY DEBUT, AND
[ct=6125.885] PHILLY WILL PUNCH IT AWAY WITH
[ct=6127.217] 3:35 TO GO.
[ct=6128.544] >> Cris: GOING TO END UP GETTING
[ct=6129.914] A LOOP AROUND HERE.
[ct=6133.936] SO AS THE SCRAMBLE BEGINS TO
[ct=6133.936] HAPPEN, THEY’VE GOT
[ct=6139.289] ACCOUNTABILITY ALL THE WAY
[ct=6139.289] ACROSS.
[ct=6140.487] IN THAT SITUATION, ABLE TO GO
[ct=6144.451] ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE FIELD
[ct=6145.866] THERE TO FO
[ct=6147.199] PASS.
[ct=6148.564] BUT NO FIRST DOWN.
[ct=6151.238] >> Mike: NICE ADJUSTMENT FROM
[ct=6152.497] MATT EBERFLUS, THE DEFENSIVE
[ct=6153.857] COORDINATOR.
[ct=6153.857] THE MAN HAS NOT LET TURPIN
[ct=6157.842] RETURN IT TWICE HERE.
[ct=6159.240] SPRINTING HERE, HANDS ON THAT,
[ct=6160.478] AND CANNOT.
[ct=6163.208] YOU CAN SEE HIS FRUSTRATION.
[ct=6165.770] BUT DO NOT FORGET THE
[ct=6180.641] >> Mike: CRIS, 3:02, DALLAS DOWN
[ct=6181.986] FOUR, ALL THREE TIME-OUTS?
[ct=6183.331] >> Cris: AT TWO MINUTES, THIS IS
[ct=6184.614] ALREADY A VERY THIN DEFENSIVE
[ct=6187.306] I DON’T WANT THEM SUBSTITUTING
[ct=6188.646] ONE TIME WITH THE TWO-MINUTE
[ct=6189.977] WARNING.
[ct=6189.977] I WANT THOSE GUYS OUT THERE
[ct=6191.295] PLAYING.
[ct=6191.295] BUT PLENTY OF TIME.
[ct=6193.936] THE COWBOYS CAN RUN THE BALL.
[ct=6196.592] THEY CAN DO ANYTHING THEY WANT.
[ct=6197.883] >> Mike: DEVONTA WILLIAMS AT
[ct=6199.163] CAUGHT BY FERGUSON.
[ct=6200.494] OUT OF BOUNDS.
[ct=6201.920] ZACK BAUN COVERING AT THE 23
[ct=6204.516] YOU TALKED ABOUT THE ABSENCE OF
[ct=6207.226] CARTER INSIDE.
[ct=6208.545] JORDAN DAVIS BEEN ON THE FIELD A
[ct=6209.843] LOT.
[ct=6211.142] FERGUSON TERRIFIC.
[ct=6212.487] FULL ONE-HANDED GRAB THERE.
[ct=6213.865] >> SURE WAS.
[ct=6215.209] THAT WAS A GUTSY THROW ON THE
[ct=6216.449] PART OF PRESCOTT, AS WELL, BUT A
[ct=6219.149] GOOD DRIVE STARTED FOR THEM.
[ct=6220.472] WE MAY HAVE TO SEE DAK RUN THE
[ct=6221.819] FOOTBALL A LITTLE BIT HERE, TOO,
[ct=6224.459] BEFORE IT’S DONE.
[ct=6225.756] >> Mike: HE THROWS.
[ct=6229.740] ALMOST INTERCEPTED.
[ct=6231.017] OH, PROBLEM TIMES THREE.
[ct=6239.022] SNAP, PRESSURE, AND NEAR PICK.
[ct=6239.022] >> Cris: GREAT CATCH.
[ct=6240.351] AND THEN HE THREW IT INTO
[ct=6241.716] TRAFFIC ONE MORE TIME.
[ct=6247.001] AND CEEDEE SLIPPED.
[ct=6247.001] SHOULD HAVE HAD IT.
[ct=6250.979] SHOULD HAVE BEEN GAME OVER.
[ct=6262.886] >> Mike: NOW THIRD AND 5.
[ct=6264.248] FULL MAN PRESSURE.
[ct=6268.304] PRESCOTT’S THROW IS CAUGHT BY
[ct=6269.602] GEORGE PICKENS AT THE SIDELINE.
[ct=6270.950] FIRST DOWN, DALLAS AT THE 38.
[ct=6273.662] >> Cris: ONE THING YOU ALWAYS
[ct=6274.924] SEE OUT OF PICKENS IS HE EXTENDS
[ct=6277.648] HIS ARMS TO MAKE CATCHES.
[ct=6278.915] IF HE DID NOT HERE, HE WOULD
[ct=6280.255] HAVE HAD THAT BALL STRIPPED OUT
[ct=6280.255] OF HIS HANDS.
[ct=6282.837] BUT AS HE IS ABLE TO STRETCH
[ct=6285.518] OUT, IT’S WHY YOU SEE HIM MAKE
[ct=6286.878] SO MANY OF THOSE CONTESTED
[ct=6286.878] CATCHES BECAUSE THEY EXTENDS THE
[ct=6292.153] ARMS AND MAKES THE PLAY.
[ct=6293.520] >> Mike: NOW THEY LET IT GO
[ct=6296.185] GOT OUT OF BOUNDS.
[ct=6300.236] THE CLOCK WAS STOPPED.
[ct=6301.542] PRESCOTT LOOKING MIDDLE.
[ct=6304.263] COVER COMING DOWNFIELD.
[ct=6306.808] T.D. TRYING TO HANG ON.
[ct=6310.818] RICOCHETED TO BLANKENSHIP.
[ct=6313.643] >> Cris: WHAT A -- WHOA.
[ct=6318.874] BY DAK PRESCOTT.
[ct=6318.874] AND IT HIT CEEDEE STRAIGHT IN
[ct=6321.627] THE HANDS.
[ct=6321.627] THAT’S TWO.
[ct=6322.872] THAT’S TWO IN THE SECOND HALF
[ct=6324.241] THAT HE HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO
[ct=6332.263] HOLD ON TO.
[ct=6346.845] WOW.
[ct=6346.845] IT’S TIME.
[ct=6353.612] THAT ONE WAS IN HARM’S WAY FOR
[ct=6354.898] LUKE SCHOONMAKER.
[ct=6358.891] SECOND-YEAR STAR.
[ct=6360.238] >> Cris: RIGHT NOW, THE EAGLES
[ct=6364.185] ARE JUST COMING WITH THAT
[ct=6368.224] FOUR-MAN PRESSURE.
[ct=6369.567] AND FOR CEEDEE LAMB, HE’S SICK.
[ct=6370.827] HE HAD A CHANCE TO FLIP THIS
[ct=6370.827] GAME WITH A PLAY THAT WAS
[ct=6372.185] TAILOR-MADE FOR HIM.
[ct=6372.185] HE JUST DOESN’T DROP THOSE
[ct=6389.377] BALLS.
[ct=6397.402] WILLIAMS, A NICE CATCH.
[ct=6398.793] DECISION TIME.
[ct=6398.793] SHY OF THE 45.
[ct=6401.448] NEED TO GET TO THE 48.
[ct=6402.766] PULLS IT IN ON THE TW
[ct=6404.133] WHAT DO THEY DO?
[ct=6409.455] >> Cris: I THINK YOU GO FOR IT.
[ct=6410.762] >> Mike: JUMP THE BALL RIGHT
[ct=6410.762] AWAY HERE.
[ct=6412.127] >> Cris: THEY STILL HAVE ALL
[ct=6414.734] THREE TIME-OUTS REMAINING, AND
[ct=6416.051] THE TWO-MINUTE WARNING.
[ct=6417.438] IF THEY GET THIS PLAY OFF IN
[ct=6422.660] TIME --
[ct=6422.660] >> Mike: TAKE IT DOWN TO THE
[ct=6425.379] TWO-MINUTE WARNING.
[ct=6428.029] WITH THE OFFSIDE.
[ct=6430.712] ISSUE.
[ct=6432.023] >> Mike: PHYSICALLY AND
[ct=6432.023] MENTALLY.
[ct=6433.298] EVERYBODY’S KIND OF WIPED OUT
[ct=6434.671] HERE AFTER MIDNIGHT.
[ct=6437.306] WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING HERE,
[ct=6437.306] FOURTH AND 3?
[ct=6440.016] >> Cris: WE HAVEN’T SEEN DAK RUN
[ct=6443.959] ONE TIME IN THIS BALL GAME.
[ct=6445.227] HE WOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO
[ct=6445.227] PICK THIS FIRST DOWN UP.
[ct=6449.243] WE HAVEN’T SEEN HIM RUN, THOUGH.
[ct=6450.565] >> Mike: TWO-MINUTE WARNING
[ct=6451.922] AGAINST THE EAGLES.
[ct=6454.559] PASS RUSH A CHANCE TO RECHARGE.
[ct=6458.586] FOURTH AND 3.
[ct=6459.922] >> Cris: THEY’LL BRING THE
[ct=6461.215] PRESSURE, AT LEAST SHOWING IT.
[ct=6462.560] >> Mike: AND THEY ARE BRINGING
[ct=6466.527] AS PRESCOTT’S LOFTING IT.
[ct=6467.794] CEEDEE COULDN’T BRING THAT ONE
[ct=6469.169] IN EITHER.
[ct=6473.187] THIRD TIME IN THE HALF.
[ct=6481.126] EAGLES TAKE OVER ON DOWNS.
[ct=6485.205] >> Cris: HE KNEW WHAT HE WA
[ct=6486.464] AS SOON AS THEY BOUGHT THE
[ct=6487.719] PRESSURE, HERE COME THE
[ct=6487.719] BLITZERS.
[ct=6489.165] THAT ONE ON ONE ON THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=6489.165] WHO’S YOUR BEST PLAYER?
[ct=6491.762] HERE IT COMES.
[ct=6505.137] SMART CATCH BUT CATCHABLE.
[ct=6505.137] TOUGH CATCH.
[ct=6506.526] TOUGH ONE.
[ct=6509.105] >> Mike: YOU GOT IT.
[ct=6511.734] SO GAME NOT OVER, ALTHOUGH
[ct=6513.119] CEEDEE IS SO FRUSTRATED WITH
[ct=6515.738] WHAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE THE
[ct=6515.738] BREAK.
[ct=6519.707] A COUPLE OPPORTUNITIES.
[ct=6521.068] DALLAS, ALL THREE TIME-OUTS.
[ct=6522.372] CAN GET THE BALL BACK IF THEY
[ct=6526.392] CAN STOP PHILLY WITH ABOUT 1:20
[ct=6526.392] OR SO TO GO.
[ct=6529.033] TRYING TO STOP BARKLEY.
[ct=6531.717] ONCE AGAIN, SAM WILLIAMS OFF THE
[ct=6534.358] EDGE AND ON THE PLAY.
[ct=6535.694] CEEDEE LAMB HEADING, OF COURSE,
[ct=6538.390] TO THE MEDICAL TENT HERE.
[ct=6539.695] COWBOYS TAKE THE FIRST TIME-OUT
[ct=6540.977] AT 1:50.
[ct=6542.365] >> Cris: DON’T KNOW WHAT
[ct=6543.643] HAPPENED TO CEEDEE, BUT DAK
[ct=6544.951] PRESCOTT HAS TO BE A LITTLE SICK
[ct=6548.957] OF THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT HAVE
[ct=6548.957] BEEN PRESENTED THAT THEY HAVE
[ct=6552.959] NOT CONVERTED ON.
[ct=6552.959] >> Mike: THIS IS THE FIRST ONE
[ct=6557.019] IN THAT DRIVE.
[ct=6559.726] >> Cris: YOU HAD THE ONE ON THE
[ct=6561.136] CROSSING ROUTE.
[ct=6561.136] >> Mike: YEP.
[ct=6562.460] >> Cris: AND THAT IS JUST A
[ct=6563.752] >> Mike: YES.
[ct=6565.103] >> Cris: THAT’S A TOUGH PLAY.
[ct=6566.388] THAT ONE DOESN’T GO DOWN IN DROP
[ct=6570.386] CATEGORY FOR ME.
[ct=6573.052] >> Mike: SECOND DOWN COMING UP.
[ct=6574.357] PHILADELPHIA AGAIN STOPPED ON A
[ct=6575.680] FIRST-DOWN RUN, WHICH H0tí
[ct=6577.043] ONE OF THE THEMES SINCE THE
[ct=6578.354] >> Cris: REALLY HAS BEEN.
[ct=6579.643] BUT CEEDEE’S GOING TO CATCH ONE
[ct=6587.733] PRETTY SOON.
[ct=6587.733] >> Mike: THEY’RE GOING TO THROW
[ct=6590.359] ON SECOND DOWN.
[ct=6591.683] AND IT IS COMPLETE TO A.J.
[ct=6595.604] BROWN.
[ct=6596.968] WITH MOMENTUM.
[ct=6600.912] SHOTTEN HYMER TO USE HIS SECOND
[ct=6602.254] TIME-OUT, THIRD AND 2.
[ct=6604.970] I MEAN, KNOWLEDGEABLE FANS KNOW,
[ct=6606.271] THEY’VE BEEN QUIET FOR A.J.
[ct=6608.915] THEY GETS ON THE BOARD WITH A
[ct=6611.559] GRAB IN A KEY MOMENT.
[ct=6612.851] >> Cris: YOU KNOW, IT’S REALLY
[ct=6614.135] INTERESTING, COMING UP TO THIS
[ct=6615.492] NEXT ONE, THAT BALL IS A YARD
[ct=6618.186] AND A HALF OR SO SHORT.
[ct=6622.166] IS THIS THE OPPORTUNITY NOW
[ct=6623.505] WHERE YOU JUST GO, WE’RE GOING
[ct=6624.796] TO WIN THE GAME WITH OUR BEST
[ct=6627.466] MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GET IT THE
[ct=6628.828] FIRST TIME, BUT HAVEN’T SEEN
[ct=6630.172] THEM STOP THEM FOR A YARD OR A
[ct=6634.132] YARD AND A HALF YET.
[ct=6638.058] >> Mike: ON TARGET TO BROWN.
[ct=6639.508] SEVEN OF THE 19 COMPLETIONS TO
[ct=6644.836] >> Cris: BUT ALSO, REMEMBER
[ct=6647.459] LANDON DICKERSON NOT IN THERE,
[ct=6650.097] AND YOU’RE MAKING THE TRANSITION
[ct=6650.097] FROM A GUY, BECTON, FROM A YEAR
[ct=6656.810] >> Mike: LURIE, THE OWNER OF THE
[ct=6658.008] EAGLES WATCHES AS WELL.
[ct=6660.734] EAGLES HAVE IT SPREAD OUT.
[ct=6660.734] TRYING TO GET A FIRST DOWN TO
[ct=6664.616] CLOSE IT OUT.
[ct=6664.616] THEY GO EMPTY.
[ct=6673.982] >> Cris: BETTER SPY.
[ct=6675.337] >> Mike: HURTS LOOKING TO TAKE
[ct=6677.978] HURTS HAS THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=6681.959] JALEN HURTS DOES IT WITH HIS
[ct=6685.902] LEGS, WHICH TOOK CARE OF THOSE
[ct=6689.952] EARLY DRIVES.
[ct=6691.209] DALLAS TAKES THEIR FINAL
[ct=6692.535] TIME-OUT.
[ct=6695.242] >> Cris: YOU GO EMPTY, YOU JUST
[ct=6696.483] HAVE SO MANY BODIES IN HERE.
[ct=6697.825] I THOUGHT THEY MIGHT BE SPYING
[ct=6700.620] BUT THEY DID NOT.
[ct=6703.176] THEY SIT THE TIGHT END DOWN,
[ct=6705.872] THEY GET RIGHT IN FRONT OF
[ct=6705.872] SANBORN.
[ct=6707.144] BUT WHEN YOU GO EMPTY AGAINST
[ct=6708.447] THE PHILADELPHIA EAGLES, YOU
