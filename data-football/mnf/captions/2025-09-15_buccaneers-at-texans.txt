ME, YOU
CAN ASK THE VIKINGS.
TAMPA BAY WON THE TOSS.
THEY DEFER.
HOUSTON STARTS THE NIGHT WITH
THE BALL AND THIS IS THE ROOKIE
JAYLIN NOEL AND NOEL TRYING TO
GET TO THE EDGE MAKES A NICE
CUT AND HE'S OUT OF BOUNDS
CROSSING THE 35.
A 33-YARD RETURN BY JAYLIN
NOEL, THE ROOKIE FROM IOWA
STATE.
HERE IS C.J.
STROUD WORKING IN CONCERT WITH
NICK CALEY, HIS NEW OFFENSIVE
COORDINATOR, AND THERE ARE HIS
NUMBERS, JUST 188 PASS YARDS IN
THAT WEEK ONE LOSS AND TO ME
THERE'S STILL QUESTION MARKS
WITH THAT OFFENSIVE LINE IN
FRONT OF HIM.
QUICK THROW AND OFF THE RIGHT
HAND OF NICO COLLINS.
THAT'S THE WAY THE NIGHT STARTS
FOR C.J.
STROUD.
WE'LL LOOK AT THE LINEUP FOR
THE HOUSTON OFFENSE.
THEY'RE BACKS, THEIR RECEIVERS,
NICK CHUBB AND THE OFFENSIVE
LINE, THEY TRADED AWAY LAREMY
TUNSIL AND THEY'VE GOT A ROOKIE
STARTING AT LEFT TACKLE IN
AIREONTAE ERSERY.
Troy:  BUT GETTING ED INGRAM
BACK THIS WEEK AT RIGHT GUARD
KIND OF PUTS EVERYONE BACK IN
THEIR ORIGINAL SEASONS.
THEY HAD TO SHUFFLE THEIR
OFFENSIVE LINE LAST WEEK, ALSO.
Joe:  HERE'S HUTCHINSON,
MAKES A CATCH, NICE GRAB OVER
THE MIDDLE.
HE GOT NINE AND THAT WILL BRING
UP THIRD DOWN AND ONE, QUICK
STRIKE FROM C.J.
STROUD.
THIS DEFENSE FOR TODD BOWLES,
FOR GEORGE EDWARDS, FOR THIS
DEFENSIVE GROUP, IS ANCHORED BY
THAT BIG MAN IN THE MIDDLE IN
VITA VEA.
TODD BOWLES SAYS HE IS THE
STRENGTH OF OUR DEFENSE, BUT
THEY'RE GOOD AT EVERY LEVEL.
Troy:  THEY'RE VERY WELL
COACHED AND TODD BOWLES HAS
BEEN DOING IT ONE WAY MANY
YEARS IN THIS LEAGUE.
HE'S AGGRESSIVE.
THEY PLAY A PHYSICAL BRAND OF
FOOTBALL DEFENSIVELY.
Joe:  THEY LINE UP AND GET A
YARD BY HANDING IT TO CHUBB.
THE ANSWER IS YES, IF I'M TO
BELIEVE THE OFFICIAL RUNNING IN
FROM THE FAR SIDE OF THE FIELD.
HE IS VEERING A LITTLE.
IT IS VERY CLOSE TO FIRST DOWN
YARDAGE.
THE BUCCANEERS THINKING IT'S
FOURTH DOWN.
AND IT IS A FIRST DOWN FOR
DeMECO RYANS OFFENSE AND IT
WASN'T EASY.
Troy:  NO, IT WAS NOT.
BIG VITA VEA RIGHT IN THE
MIDDLE AND THAT'S A NEW PART OF
THIS OFFENSIVE RUN GAME.
RIGHT HERE AT THE NOSE TACKLE
IS NUMBER 50, VITA VEA, JARRETT
PATTERSON STARTING TONIGHT AT
CENTER, NOT ABLE TO GET MUCH
MOVEMENT, BUT JUST ENOUGH FOR
CHUBB TO PICK IT UP.
Joe:  THEY GO BACK TO THE
GROUND.
IT'S CHUBB AND HE LOST YARDAGE,
MET IN THE BACKFIELD BY
SirVOCEA DENNIS AND A LOSS OF
TWO AND DENNIS WAS NOT ALONE.
Troy:  CALIJAH KANCEY,
NUMBER 94, HE WRECKS THIS PLAY
FROM THE START, BLOWS IT UP AND
TWO MORE TO FINISH IT OFF.
THIS IS A MUCH DIFFERENT RUN
GAME FROM THE ONE WE'VE SEEN
FROM THE HOUSTON TEXANS THE
LAST TWO YEARS UNDER OFFENSIVE
COORDINATOR BOBBY SLOVAK.
Joe:  SECOND DOWN CHUBB WITH
ROOM IN FRONT OF HIM, HAD A
BLOCKER, PATTERSON, AND CHUBB
DOWN NEAR THE 30, MAYBE JUST
INSIDE.
27 YARDS ON A SCREEN AND THE
CENTER, JARRETT PATTERSON, WAS
OUT THERE LEADING THE WAY.
Troy:  ED INGRAM, NUMBER 69
AT RIGHT GUARD, HE GETS JUST
ENOUGH TO FREE HIM UP AND ALLOW
HIM TO GET ON THE EDGE AND THEN
LIKE YOU SAID, OUTSIDE BLOCKING
IN FRONT OF HIM AND SO A NICE
SCREEN PASS, TAKE A LITTLE
PRESSURE WITH THE PASS RUSH
COMING AT THE QUARTERBACK.
Joe:  WOODY MARKS, END ZONE
SHOT, COLLINS, HE'S GOT IT,
TOUCHDOWN, TEXANS, WHAT A
CATCH, WHAT A THROW.
AND LET'S SEE IF HE WAS INDEED
INBOUNDS.
Troy:  HE'S GOT IT THERE.
THE RIGHT TOE COMES DOWN IN.
Joe:  THE QUESTION IS WAS
THE LEFT FOOT STILL DOWN WHEN
HE SECURED THE CATCH?
IT'S A SCORING PLAY, SO THEY
WILL OBVIOUSLY LOOK AT IT.
Troy:  YEAH, JOE, IN THIS
SITUATION WHAT THEY'LL BE
LOOKING AT IS WHETHER THE SHIN
TOUCHES THE GROUND, BUT IT
LOOKS LIKE YOU ALSO MIGHT HAVE
TWO FEET TOUCHING THE GROUND
AFTER YOU HAD CONTROL.
SO THEY'LL TAKE A LOOK AT THIS,
BUT I THINK THEY'LL STAY WITH
IT.
Joe:
WELL, THAT
WELL, THAT LAST LOOK BEFORE
WE WENT TO BREAK TOLD YOU ALL
YOU NEEDED TO KNOW.
THE TOUCHDOWN CALL HAS BEEN
CONFIRMED.
NICO COLLINS WITH A BRILLIANT
CATCH FOR THE TEXANS FIRST
TOUCHDOWN OF THE SEASON.
Troy:  YEAH, REALLY A GREAT
JOB.
THESE TWO TEAMS A YEAR AGO WERE
THE TOP TWO TEAMS SCORING ON
THEIR OPENING POSSESSION TO
START A GAME.
LAST WEEK BOTH TEAM GOES THREE
AND OUT.
WE SAID COMING INTO THIS GAME
REALLY IMPORTANT IN LIGHT OF
NOT BEING ABLE TO SCORE A
TOUCHDOWN A WEEK AGO THAT
HOUSTON HAVE SOME SUCCESS EARLY
IN THIS GAME, NO BETTER WAY
THAN GO TO YOUR PLAYMAKER, NICO
COLLINS.
Joe:  KA'IMI FAIRBAIRN WILL
ATTEMPT HIS FIRST EXTRA POINT
OF THE SEASON.
HE WAS 3 FOR 3 IN FIELD GOAL
TRIES LAST YEAR.
WITH TOWNSEND HOLDING, HE
KNOCKS IT THROUGH.
Troy:  GO BACK AND LOOK AT
THIS TOUCHDOWN AND WINFIELD IS
HERE AT SAFETY.
AS SOON AS HE MOVES TO THE
MIDDLE, C.J.
STROUD KNOWS HE'S GOT ONE ON
ONE WITH NICO COLLINS AGAINST
ZYON MCCOLLUM AND HE'S GOING TO
TAKE THAT SHOT ALL DAY.
THIS IS A PERFECT THROW BY C.J.
STROUD TO LAY IT OUT THERE AND
GIVE BIG NICO AN OPPORTUNITY TO
MAKE A PLAY.
HE MAKES THESE LOOK ROUTINE.
Troy:  LOOK AT THE FEET,
ABLE TO GET BOTH DOWN BEFORE HE
HEADED OUT OF BOUNDS.
THE HOUSTON OFFENSE DID NOT
HAVE A PLAY LAST WEEK IN WEEK
ONE OF 25 PLUS YARDS.
THEY HAD TWO ON THEIR OPENING
DRIVE, BACK-TO-BACK BIG PLAYS,
27-YARD SCREEN TO CHUBB AND 29-
YARD TOUCHDOWN TO NICO COLLINS.
Troy:  LAST WEEK NICO ONLY
HAD FIVE TARGETS AND THREE
RECEPTIONS IN THE GAME.
FIVE TARGETS FOR HIM IS NOT
ENOUGH.
YOU KNOW THERE WAS AN EMPHASIS
COMING INTO THIS GAME, HEY,
WE'RE GOING TO GET SOME ONE-ON-
ONE LOOKS.
LET'S TRY TO GET THE BALL TO
NICO EARLY.
Joe:  FAIRBAIRN WILL KICK IT
AWAY.
WAITING FOR IT, IT'S TUCKER AND
HE WILL TAKE A KNEE AND NOW TO
THE 35 IT WILL COME.
BAKER MAYFIELD, WHAT A THREE-
YEAR RUN HE HAS HAD WITH THE
TAMPA BAY BUCCANEERS IN HIS
TIME AS A STARTER.
HE HASN'T MISSED A START.
HE'S 20-15.
HE'S NOW NUMBER TWO IN THE NFL
IN TOUCHDOWN PASSES SINCE HE
CAME TO TAMPA BAY BECAUSE JARED
GOFF HAD FIVE TOUCHDOWNS IN THE
LIONS' WIN AGAINST CHICAGO AND
WE HAVE THE LIONS TAKING ON THE
RAVENS NEXT WEEK ON MONDAY
NIGHT FOOTBALL.
Troy:  THAT WASN'T A VERY
NICE HOMECOMING THEY GAVE TO
BEN JOHNSON RETURNING TO
DETROIT.
Joe:  NO.
Troy:  MAN, WHAT AN
OFFENSIVE PERFORMANCE THAT WAS
AND JARED GOFF,
CONGRATULATIONS.
Joe:  THEY INITIALLY PUT THE
BALL AT THE 20 AND SAID OH,
WAIT, WE'RE IN A NEW ERA.
OUT TO THE 35 IT CAME.
MAYFIELD IS IN TROUBLE.
HE'S LOOKING OUT AT SHEPARD AND
THROWS IT OVER HIS HEAD FOR AN
INCOMPLETION.
THERE'S A LOT TO TALK ABOUT
WITH THIS OFFENSE.
FIRST OF ALL, THEY'RE PLAYING
WITHOUT CHRIS GODWIN AND JALEN
McMILLAN.
THEY STILL HAVE BUCKY IRVING
AND RACHAAD
WHITE.
AND GRAHAM BARTON HAD AN
OUTSTANDING GAME LAST WEEK, BUT
IF THERE WAS EVER A GAME YOU
WANTED TRISTAN WIRFS IN THE
LINEUP, IT'S TONIGHT.
Joe:  HERE'S IRVING AND HAD
HE TO FIGHT FOR FOUR YEARS.
TO'OTO'O MADE THE STOP AND HE
IS RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS
TEXANS' DEFENSE, WHICH IS
OUTSTANDING UP FRONT,
ESPECIALLY ON THE EDGES WITH
WILL ANDERSON JR. AND HUNTER.
Troy:  THEY ARE AWFULLY GOOD
AT EVERY LEVEL AND IT STARTS
WITH THESE TWO GUYS HERE FLYING
OFF THE EDGE.
Joe:  THIRD DOWN AND SIX.
EXTRA MAN ON THE RUSH, PASS
CAUGHT, FIRST DOWN TAMPA BAY
AND THAT'S MIKE EVANS.
HE'S FROM GALVESTON, TEXAS.
HE PLAYED AT TEXAS A&amp;M AND
MAKES THE CATCH FOR EIGHT AND A
FIRST DOWN.
Troy:  YOU SEE THE PRESSURE
BAKER MAYFIELD IS FACING EARLY
IN THIS GAME.
THERE'S A FIVE-MAN RUSH.
YOU GOT TO GET THE BALL OUT.
IF YOU WATCHED THAT GAME LAST
WEEK FOR THE L.A.
RAMS AGAINST THE TEXANS,
MATTHEW STAFFORD SIMPLY WAS NOT
GOING TO HOLD THE FOOTBALL AND
HE WAS SUCCESSFUL DOING IT, BUT
THE DEFENSIVE FRONT IS JUST TOO
GOOD TO HOLD ONTO THE FOOTBALL
IF YOU'RE BAKER MAYFIELD.
Joe:  ON FIRST DOWN MAYFIELD
PROTECTED GOING DOWN THE MIDDLE
OF THE FIELD AND NEARLY PICKED
OFF BY AL-SHAAIR.
THAT BALL WAS UNDERTHROWN AND
EGBUKA WAS COVERED PRETTY WELL.
Troy:  HE'S GOING TO GO
DEEP, BUT AZEEZ AL-SHAAIR HAS
TO CARRY IT DOWN THE MIDDLE.
YOU CAN SEE THE SPEED HE HAS.
YOU WON'T GET A BETTER
OPPORTUNITY THAN HE HAS ON THAT
PLAY TO MAKE AN INTERCEPTION,
JUST UNABLE TO MAKE THE CATCH,
BUT HE SHOWED WHAT KIND OF
ATHLETICISM HE HAS BEING ABLE
TO RUN THAT DEEP.
Joe:  ON SECOND AND TEN WIDE
OPEN OVER THE MIDDLE AND A
FIRST DOWN CATCH IS MADE BY
CADE OTTON AND THAT'S THE FIRST
CATCH BY A TIGHT END FOR THE
BUCCANEERS TO START THIS YEAR
AND IT BELONGS TO NUMBER 88.
Troy:  CADE OTTON IS ONE OF
THOSE GUYS WHO RARELY COMES OFF
THE FIELD AND WITH THE WIDE
RECEIVERS THEY HAVE SOMETIMES
HE BECOMES A BIT OF A FORGOTTEN
GUY, BUT HE'S SO DEPENDABLE
WHEN HE WORKS THE MIDDLE OF THE
FIELD, NOT A BIG DEEP THREAT,
BUT AWFULLY RELIABLE, GREAT JOB
HANGING ONTO THE FOOTBALL AFTER
THAT HIT.
Joe:  EGBUKA IN MOTION,
IRVING ABLE TO PICK HIS WAY TO
THE 35.
GOT A GOOD BLOCK FROM CADE
OTTON WHO MADE THAT PREVIOUS
CATCH AND THE TACKLE BY
LASSITER AFTER A GAIN OF SIX.
Troy:  YOU THINK ABOUT THIS
BUCS' OFFENSE IN '22 AND '23
AND THEY WERE THE WORST RUSHING
OFFENSE IN FOOTBALL.
WHEN TOM BRADY WAS HERE, THEY
DIDN'T EVEN TRY TO RUN IT.
IN '23 THEY COULDN'T RUN IT AND
THEN BUCKY IRVING COMES IN AND
LAST YEAR HAS A BIG SEASON,
FIRST 1,000-YARD RUSHER SINCE
2015, AVERAGED OVER FIVE YARDS
A CARRY.
Joe:  SECOND DOWN AND FOUR,
MAYFIELD STEPS THROUGH, THROWS
ON THE RUN.
HE'S GOT STERLING SHEPARD.
HE'S GOT A FIRST DOWN AND BAKER
MAYFIELD SHOWING WHAT HE CAN DO
AS HE WORKED HIS WAY OUT TO THE
EDGE AND HAD HIS EYES
DOWNFIELD.
Troy:  BAKER IS NOT ONE OF
THESE SCRAMBLERS, YET HE'S
REALLY EFFECTIVE WHEN HE DOES
IT.
HE KEEPS PLAYING THROUGH THE
BALL AND BAKER GETS OUTSIDE THE
POCKET, TRUSTS HIM TO WORK BACK
TO HIM AND DELIVERS A GOOD
FOOTBALL.
Joe:  THOSE TWO HAVE BEEN
DOING THAT SINCE THEY WERE AT
OKLAHOMA TOGETHER.
Troy:  YES, THEY HAVE.
AND STERLING SHEPARD WATCHING
HIM, HE DID A LOT OF GREAT
THINGS WITH THE GIANTS.
THEN IT LOOKED LIKE HE WAS
BANGED UP.
HE LOOKS ABOUT AS HEALTHY AS
I'VE SEEN HIM IN A LONG TIME.
Joe:  HERE IS EVANS USING
HIS BODY AND WE'LL SEE.
THERE ARE FLAGS AND THIS MIGHT
BE ON EVANS.
HE SHOVED STINGLEY AND IT IS
AGAINST NUMBER 13.
Troy:  YOU SEE THE RIGHT
HAND.
HE EXTENDS IT.
THAT'S A GOOD CALL.
Joe:  SIX-TIME PRO BOWLER
WHO IS BIG, 6'5, 231 IN HIS
12th YEAR AND HE GOT THAT ARM
EXTENDED AND GOT THE FLAG.
Troy:  IT'S THE RIGHT IDEA.
HE GETS THE PENALTY AND IT WAS
A GOOD CALL.
THAT'S GOING TO BE A GOOD MATCH-
UP.
DEREK STINGLEY TYPICALLY WOULD
JUST PLAY THE DEFENSIVE LEFT
CORNER POSITION, BUT LAST WEEK
HE TRAVELED WITH DAVANTE ADAMS
AND THIS IS GOING TO BE A GOOD
MATCH-UP.
IT LOOKS LIKE THAT'S WHAT
THEY'LL DO TONIGHT, PAIR HIM UP
AGAINST MIKE EVANS.
Joe:  BRINGS UP FIRST AND 20
AT THE 2, IRVING NICE MOVE AND
TAKES IT DOWN NEAR THE 19,
JALEN PITRE WITH THE STOP.
Troy:  THE RIGHT TACKLE HAD
AN ANKLE INJURY HE SUFFERED
WEEK ONE AND HE SIGNED A NEW
EXTENSION COMING INTO THIS
SEASON.
SO THEY REALLY LIKE THEIR RIGHT
TACKLE AND LOVE THEIR LEFT
TACKLE TRISTAN WIRFS WHEN HE'S
HEALTHY, BUT GRAHAM BARTON
DRAWS THE ASSIGNMENT TONIGHT.
WE'LL SEE AS WE MOVE THROUGH
THIS GAME, BUT NOT MANY GUYS
CAN GO FROM CENTER TO BE
PLAYING OUT IN SPACE AT LEFT
TACKLE.
Joe:  WIRFS CAME BACK TO
PRACTICE THIS WEEK, GETTING
CLOSER.
MAYFIELD END ZONE, CAUGHT FOR
THE TOUCHDOWN RYAN MILLER.
FIRST CATCH OF THE YEAR FOR
NUMBER 81 AND SO YOU WORRY
ABOUT EGBUKA AND EVANS AND
OTTON AND IRVING AND THEN RYAN
MILLER GETS YOU FOR A 20-YARD
TOUCHDOWN.
Troy:  YEAH.
AND IT'S NOT WHERE MAYFIELD
WANTED TO GO WITH THE FOOTBALL.
THAT WAS HIS THIRD READ IN THE
PROGRESSION.
YOU'LL SEE BAKER, HE'S WORKING
THE RIGHT SIDE WITH STERLING
SHEPARD.
HE COMES BACK AND A REALLY NICE
ROUTE BY RYAN MILLER, BUT THE
REASON HE'S ABLE TO GET BACK TO
HIM, THAT OFFENSIVE LINE GIVING
HIM THE TIME TO GET TO HIS
THIRD GUY IN THE PROGRESSION.
Joe:  EXTRA POINT TO TIE IT
BY McLAUGHLIN.
HE MISSED IT LAST WEEK.
HE KNOCKS THIS ONE THROUGH AND
A THIRD CAREER TOUCHDOWN CATCH
FOR THE SECOND YEAR PRO FROM
FUHRMAN, SHOUT OUT BRAD.
TOP TO
BOTTOM.
I LOOKED AT YOU WHEN WE WERE
REHEARSING ON CAMERA AND I SAID
WOULD YOU EVER?
Troy:  NOT A CHANCE.
I WOULD IF YOU WENT FIRST AND I
KNEW THE CABLE WOULD HOLD.
Joe:  OH, OKAY, FAIR.
RIGHT IN LINE WITH YOU MAKING
ME TASTE YOUR FOOD BEFORE.
I KNOW HOW IT WORKS FOR THE OLD
HALL OF FAME QUARTERBACKS.
7-7 GAME, SEVEN TO GO IN THE
FIRST.
Troy:  FOR THESE OFFENSES
THAT WE TALKED ABOUT THAT CAME
OUT LAST WEEK AND STRUGGLED A
LITTLE, BOY, THEY LOOK LIKE
THEY'RE MIDSEASON FORM RIGHT
NOW.
Joe:  REALLY IMPRESSIVE
DRIVES BY EACH SIDE.
THIS IS NOEL AGAIN, HAD A GOOD
ONE HIS FIRST TIME.
BROKE ONE TACKLE, NOW ANOTHER,
ANOTHER GOOD RETURN, OUT OF
BOUNDS NEAR THE 34 AND THAT'S
WHERE THEY WILL MARK HIM AS WE
SEND IT DOWN TO LAURA RUTLEDGE.
AFTER NICO COLLINS'
TOUCHDOWN WHERE ZYON McCOLLUM
WAS IN COVERAGE, HE WAS UPSET
ON THE SIDELINE.
HEAD COACH TODD BOWLES
ENCOURAGED HIM TO PUT IT BEHIND
HIM SAYING THERE'S SO MUCH MORE
GAME TO BE PLAYED.
McCOLLUM IS A HOUSTON NATIVE,
GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE
STANDS.
CALIJAH KANCEY CAME OVER AS A
REPRESENTATIVE FOR THE D-LINE
FOR McCOLLUM SAYING THE D-LINE
NEEDS TO TAKE MORE
RESPONSIBILITY TO GET IN C.J.
STROUD'S FACE A LITTLE BIT
MORE.
Joe:  McCOLLUM A CORNER THEY
JUST EXTENDED ON CONTRACT.
THE FLAG DOWN ON THE EDGE WHERE
THE BLOCK WAS DELIVERED AS
STROUD GOT AROUND.
WE'LL SEE IF THIS IS A HOLD.
Troy:  I THINK THEY'LL CALL
IT ON HAASON REDDICK.
Joe:  REDDICK BROUGHT IN ON
A ONE-YEAR DEAL, GOT A SACK
LAST WEEK, THE ONLY ONE FOR
TODD BOWLES' DEFENSE, AND HE'S
GUILTY OF THIS HOLD ON NICO
COLLINS.
Troy:  NICO ON COLLINS WAS
COMING ACROSS THE FORMATION
WITH C.J.
STROUD ON THE BOOT AND HAASON
REDDICK, BEING A VETERAN, HE
KNEW EXACTLY WHERE NICO COLLINS
WAS GOING.
HE WAS GOING TO BE THE PRIMARY
RECEIVER.
HE WAS DOING WHAT HE COULD TO
HOLD HIM UP AND HOPE THE
OFFICIALS DIDN'T CATCH IT.
Joe:  ON FIRST DOWN HANDOFF
IS TO MARKS AND A FORMER USC
TROJAN RUNNING BACK, A 1,000-
YARD BACK AT USC GETS FOUR.
JAMEL DEAN WHO TOOK A BIG PAY
CUT TO TAKE A TAMPA BAY
BUCCANEER IN EXCHANGE FOR FREE
AGENCY NEXT YEAR MADE THAT
STOP.
Troy:  PRETTY BIG MOVE ON
HIS PART, TOO, JOE, JAMEL DEAN.
HE TOOK NOT JUST A SIGNIFICANT
PAY CUT AND HE SIMPLY DID NOT
WANT TO HAVE TO START OVER.
IN EXCHANGE FOR THAT PAY CUT
HE'S ON A ONE-YEAR DEAL AND
WILL BECOME A FREE AGENT.
HE'S BASICALLY BETTING ON
HIMSELF.
Joe:  SECOND DOWN AND SIX,
THERE'S MARKS, GREAT PLAY AND
MARKS DOWN INSIDE THE 20.
FIRST CATCH IN THE NFL FOR THE
ROOKIE, WOODY MARKS, AND IT'S
GOOD FOR 37 YARDS.
Troy:  WELL, THIS IS WHAT
WOODY MARKS BRINGS.
HE WAS ONE OF THE TOP RECEIVING
BACKS IN THE COUNTRY AND YOU'LL
SEE SirVOCEA DENNIS, THIS IS
WHERE HE STRUGGLED LAST WEEK.
HE GETS HIS EYES IN THE WRONG
PLACE.
SO WHEN MARKS COMES OUT OF,
HE'S NOWHERE TO BE FOUND.
SirVOCEA DENNIS MADE HIS FIRST
START LAST WEEK IN THAT WIN
AGAINST ATLANTA.
HE DID A LOT OF GOOD THINGS,
BUT HE WAS NOT GREAT IN
COVERAGE AND IT CARRIED OVER
ALREADY INTO THIS GAME.
Joe:  YEAH.
MARKS WENT RIGHT BY HIM.
IT'S EARLY, BUT THAT 37-YARD
PLAY ON THE CATCH AND RUN,
THEIR LONGEST OF THE YEAR.
HERE'S CHUBB, NICE GAIN ON
FIRST DOWN AS McCOLLUM MAKES
THE TACKLE.
RIGHT NOW THE TEXANS ARE GOING
RIGHT THROUGH THIS TAMPA BAY
DEFENSE.
Troy:  THEY SURE ARE.
WITH CHUBB YOU DON'T HAVE MUCH
RECEIVING THREAT.
HE'S AVERAGED LESS THAN TWO
CARRIES A GAME.
THAT'S WHERE WOODY MARKS --
THAT'S HIS STRENGTH.
WE SAW WHAT HE'S ABLE TO DO.
I WOULD EXPECT HIM TO BE MORE
PART OF THIS PASSING ATTACK.
Joe:  ON SECOND DOWN AND TWO
CHUBB CUTS BACK, FIRST AND
GOAL, BUT A FLAG IS DOWN RIGHT
IN THE MIDDLE NEAR THE 13.
THIS LOOKS LIKE IT'S COMING
BACK.
TYTUS HOWARD WHO STARTED AT
RIGHT GUARD IN THE RAMS AND
BACK OUT AT RIGHT TACKLE
TONIGHT.
Troy:  YEAH.
TYTUS HOWARD, HE WAS AT RIGHT
GUARD LAST WEEK.
HE MOVES BACK TO RIGHT TACKLE.
HE'S KIND OF BEEN EVERYWHERE
OVER THE COURSE OF HIS CAREER
EXCEPT CENTER, BUT WHAT THAT
THEN DOES IS AIREONTAE ERSERY,
THEIR SECOND ROUND PICK OUT OF
MINNESOTA, HE'S NOW ON THE LEFT
SIDE BACK WHERE HE WAS MOST
COMFORTABLE.
Joe:  SECOND DOWN AND 12
FROM THE 20 AND A NICE TACKLE
IMMEDIATELY BY PARRISH, THE
ROOKIE, ON JUSTIN WATSON, THE
FORMER KANSAS CITY CHIEF AND
TAMPA BAY BUCCANEER, BRINGS UP
THIRD DOWN AND NINE.
Troy:  C.J.
STROUD IS GETTING A LITTLE BIT
OF TIME IN THE POCKET AND IT'S
EXACTLY WHAT THEY NEEDED
OFFENSIVELY IS NOT ONLY FOR
C.J.
STROUD AND THIS OFFENSE, BUT I
THINK ALSO JUST AS IMPORTANTLY,
IF NOT MORE IMPORTANTLY, FOR
OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR NICK
CALEY, CALLING PLAYS LAST WEEK
FOR THE FIRST TIME AND THE
OPERATION TONIGHT IS A LOT
SMOOTHER THAN WHAT WE SAW IN
LOS ANGELES.
Joe:  THIRD DOWN AND NINE,
GOOD PROTECTION, END ZONE SHOT
AND OUT OF THE REACH OF JUSTIN
WATSON.
SO THAT HOLDING CALL TOOK AWAY
A FIRST AND GOAL FROM THE 6,
BACKED THEM OUT TO THE 20 AND
THAT'S WHERE THE DRIVE WILL
STALL NEAR THERE WITH A FIELD
GOAL TRY COMING UP.
Troy:  WELL, JUSTIN WATSON
RUNS A PRETTY GOOD ROUTE,
TRYING TO LEAN ON HIM A LITTLE,
MIGHT HAVE BEEN A LITTLE BIT OF
A GRAB RIGHT THERE BY JAMEL
DEAN, BUT OVERALL GOOD MAN
COVERAGE.
THERE WAS REALLY NOWHERE FOR
C.J.
STROUD TO FIND SOMEBODY OPEN
ANY MORE THAN HE WAS.
Joe:  35-YARD TRY BY
FAIRBAIRN WHO HAS STARTED THE
SEASON 4 FOR 4. AND UNLOCK
YOUR ACCESS.
BOOKER T. IS HERE, TWO TIME WWE
HALL OF FAMER DOWN ON THE FIELD
PRIOR TO TONIGHT'S GAME.
FAIRBAIRN WILL KICK IT AWAY AND
THE BUCS WILL HAVE THE BALL AS
THIS ONE IS FIELDED BY JOHNSON
NEAR THE 10 AND HE GETS
ABSOLUTELY SMACKED BY E.J.
SPEED.
17-YARD RETURN AND JOHNSON, WHO
IS NOT BIG, 5'10, 170 GOT HIT
HARD.
Troy:  I'LL SAY.
THERE WAS NO WRAP-UP OR
NOTHING.
THAT WAS JUST ALL SHOULDER.
Joe:  ON THE TEXANS
OFFENSIVE SIDE TWO YARDS, TWO
SCORES.
NOW WE'LL SEE WHAT TAMPA BAY
DOES THE SECOND TIME THEY HAVE
IT.
Troy:  I THOUGHT THOSE
DYNAMIC KICKOFFS, WE WEREN'T
SUPPOSED TO SEE THOSE KINDS OF
HITS.
Joe:  THAT'S VERY TRUE.
WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF KICK
RETURNS IN 2025 AS MIKE EVANS
MAKES THE CATCH AND WE'VE SEEN
STINGLEY ON HIM SINCE EVANS GOT
OFF THE BUS AND A GAIN OF SIX
ON FIRST DOWN.
FIRST THREE DRIVES WE'VE SEEN
PLENTY OF OFFENSE.
Troy:  YES, WE HAVE.
SEE WHAT TAMPA BAY IS ABLE TO
DO HERE.
THERE'S A LOOK AT JOSH
GRIZZARD.
ADMITTEDLY HE WAS A LITTLE
NERVOUS GOING INTO THE GAME
LAST WEEK JUST LIKE SOME OF
THESE PLAYERS, HIS FIRST TIME
TO CALL PLAYS.
Joe:  BAKER HAD TROUBLE WITH
THE SNAP AS HE HANDS OFF TO
IRVING.
HE IS BROUGHT DOWN BY PITRE, A
GAIN OF TWO.
GRIZZARD IS FROM LIZARD LICK,
NORTH CAROLINA, 35 YEARS OLD,
POLYSCI MAJOR AT YALE WHERE HE
PLAYED SAFETY.
SEVEN YEARS WITH MIAMI AND LAST
YEAR WAS IN CHARGE OF THE THIRD
DOWN PACKAGE FOR TAMPA BAY.
CHARLIE HECK HAS TAKEN OVER AT
RIGHT TACKLE, THIRD AND TWO.
MAYFIELD GETS RID OF IT AND WE
WILL SEE ENOUGH FOR A FIRST
DOWN AS EGBUKA MADE THAT STRONG
CATCH.
Troy:  THAT AFFECTS THING
RIGHT THERE.
HE HAD AN ANKLE INJURY, MISSED
SOME TIME DURING PRACTICE, AND
HECK INITIALLY WAS GOING TO BE
THE LEFT TACKLE WITH WIRFS
DOWN, BUT BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T
COMFORTABLE WITH THAT LINEUP
THEY DID THE SHUFFLE LAST WEEK
THAT AFFECTED THREE POSITIONS.
NOW YOU'VE GOT CHARLIE HECK
MANNING THE RIGHT SIDE.
Joe:  HE'S WORKING AGAINST
DANIELLE HUNTER AT THE MOMENT.
IRVING GETS THE HANDOFF.
C.J.
GARDNER-JOHNSON MAKES THE
TACKLE, A GAIN OF FIVE.
Troy:  A GUY WHO HAS DONE A
HECK OF A I JOB WITH ALL THESE
CHANGES IS THEIR OFFENSIVE LINE
COACH, KEVIN CARBERRY.
WHEN THE FORMER OFFENSIVE
COORDINATOR GOT THE JOB IN
JACKSONVILLE, HE WANTED TO TAKE
CARBERRY WITH HIM.
TODD BOWLES DENIED IT.
THEY GAVE HIM A PROMOTION.
HE DID AN OUTSTANDING JOB WITH
THIS OFFENSIVE LINE.
HE'LL HAVE TO DO IT AGAIN
TONIGHT.
Joe:  THE BALL GETS BACK TO
MAYFIELD, A FLAG IN THE
SECONDARY AS MAYFIELD TRIED TO
GET IT TO EGBUKA AND JALEN
PITRE GOT HIS HANDS ON THAT
PASS.
IT WENT BACK INTO THE GUT OF
MAYFIELD WHO INDICATES HE
THINKS THE PENALTY IS AGAINST
HOUSTON.
THAT'S EXACTLY WHO THEY GET,
STINGLEY, WHO IS ACROSS FROM
MIKE EVANS.
Troy:  HE'S A COMPETENT
CORNER, ARGUABLY THE BEST IN
THE LEAGUE, CERTAINLY IN THAT
CONVERSATION.
I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT DO YOU THINK, RUSSELL?
I UNDERSTAND WHY HE CALLED
IT BECAUSE HE WENT HIGH, BUT I
DON'T THINK HE GOT IT IN THE
HEAD AND NECK AREA.
Joe:  IT'S AN AUTOMATIC
FIRST DOWN WITH UNDER HALF A
MINUTE TO PLAY IN THE FIRST
QUARTER.
MAYFIELD UNDERNEATH.
THAT'S IRVING AND THAT SHOULD
END THE QUARTER AFTER A GAIN OF
SEVEN AS PITRE COMES IN
GETTING SET TO START THE
SECOND QUARTER.
THREE MOMENTS AGO LAURA CAUGHT
UP WITH TODD BOWLES.
A LITTLE SHUFFLE IN THIS O-
LINE WITH LUKE GOEDEKE ON THE
BENCH.
WHAT ARE YOU SEEING RIGHT NOW?
WE'RE STILL MOVING THE BALL
A LITTLE BIT.
WE'VE JUST GOT TO BE SMART HOW
WE USE THEM.
WHEN YOUR DEFENSE GETS BACK
ON THE FIELD, WHAT DO YOU WANT
TO SEE?
JUST NOT BUSTED COVERAGE
UNDERNEATH AND GOT TO DO THE
LITTLE THINGS RIGHT.
THANKS, COACH.
Joe:  BOTH OFFENSES ARE
MOVING THE CHAIN.
THAT CAN'T MAKE TODD BOWLES ALL
THAT HAPPY.
THEY'RE NOW WITHOUT THEIR TWO
STARTING TACKLES AS GOEDEKE
LISTENS AWAY AND TRISTAN WIRFS
WHO CAME BACK TO PRACTICE THIS
WEEK IS WATCHING IN SWEATS.
HERE'S FIRST DOWN CARRY BY
IRVING.
SO IT'S BEEN THE FOOT AND ANKLE
FOR GOEDEKE AND THAT MIGHT HAVE
GOTTEN HIM AGAIN.
Troy:  YOU COME IN AND
YOU'RE BANGED UP AND SO MANY
AFTER EVEN ONE GAME ARE BANGED
UP IN THEIR OWN WAY.
LUKE GOEDEKE TRYING TO FIGHT
THROUGH IT.
HE MISSED SOME TIME AND AGAINST
THIS DEFENSIVE PASS RUSH, NOT
THE WEEK TO COME IN A LITTLE
HOBBLED, BUT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
WE'LL SEE MUCH OF HIM TONIGHT.
Joe:  YEAH.
HE HAS OFFICIALLY BEEN RULED
OUT.
HERE'S IRVING ON THE BACKFIELD,
NICE MOVE AS HE FAKED OUT
TO'OTO'O AND ENDED UP GETTING
FOUR AS THE ROOKIE JALEN SMITH,
YET ANOTHER PRODUCT OF THE
SNOOP YOUTH FOOTBALL LEAGUE.
Troy:  THAT'S REALLY GOOD
STUFF.
YOU CAN SEE IT MAKING AN IMPACT
AND THE OPPORTUNITY IT'S
PROVIDED.
BOTH THESE QUARTERBACKS REALLY
BEEN GOOD SPREADING THE BALL
AROUND.
Joe:  SECOND AND SIX, STRONG
RUN AND IRVING IS KNOCKED DOWN
RIGHT AT THE MARKER BY AL-
SHAAIR AND TO'OTO'O AND IT'S
GOING TO BE THIRD DOWN AND
INCHES.
Troy:  BUCKY IRVING, I
MENTIONED HIM COMING IN AND THE
KEY HE WAS GOING TO BE TO HELP
OUT BAKER MAYFIELD AND THIS
PASS RUSH AND THIS IS A GUY WHO
JUST GETS STRONGER AND STRONGER
AS THE GAME GOES ALONG.
KEEP FEEDING HIM THE BALL.
HE'S ALREADY AVERAGING OVER SIX
YARDS A CARRY.
Joe:  MAYBE TAKE A LITTLE
PRESSURE OFF THESE TACKLES
TRYING TO PASS PROTECT AGAINST
THESE DEFENSIVE ENDS.
THIRD DOWN AND ONE.
FROM THE SHOTGUN MAYFIELD IS
GOING TO PULL IT DOWN.
ANDERSON CAN'T BRING HIM DOWN
BEFORE MAYFIELD GETS THE FIRST
DOWN.
ANDERSON IS CELEBRATING, BUT
MAYFIELD LUNGED, GOT TWO AND A
FRESH SET OF DOWNS.
Troy:  I THINK BAKER GOT
LOCKED IN.
IF HE HAD SEEN CADE OTTON, HE'D
HAD A CHANCE, BUT YOU DON'T
HAVE A LOT OF TIME OUT THERE IF
YOU DON'T GET IT TO YOUR FIRST
GUY AND HE RECOGNIZES THAT,
GETS OUT OF THE POCKET AND DOES
AN EXCELLENT JOB OF DOING WHAT
HE HAD TO AND JUST GET ENOUGH
FOR THAT FIRST DOWN.
Joe:  RACHAAD WHITE CHECKS
IN.
THEY FAKE THE TOSS.
THEY THROW IT TO EGBUKA AND A
FLAG COMES DOWN ON THE NEAR
SIDE AS THE TACKLE IS MADE BY
DANIELLE HUNTER OUT IN SPACE,
GAIN OF FOUR.
SEE IF SOMEBODY LEFT THE LINE
OF SCRIMMAGE AND WENT DOWNFIELD
FOR TAMPA BAY A LITTLE TOO FAR.
Troy:  ON RIGHT GUARD CODY
MAUCH AND TAKE A LOOK AT THE
PLAY HERE AND SEE HOW FAR DOWN
THE FIELD HE GETS.
THEY GOT A COUPLE GUYS DOWN
THERE.
THIS IS A TAMPA BAY OFFENSE.
THEY RUN A LOT OF SCREENS.
THEY WERE THE TOP SCREEN TEAM
IN FOOTBALL LAST SEASON AND
THEY DO IT A VARIETY OF WAYS.
Joe:  FIRST DOWN AT 15, FLAG
ON THE PLAY, EVANS ABLE TO GET
A HAND ON IT, THEN GETS POPPED
BY BULLOCK.
IT LOOKED LIKE ANDERSON MAY
HAVE COME ACROSS EARLY, SEE WHO
THE FLAG'S AGAINST.
SO THEY GET THE FIVE YARDS BACK
AND BACK TO FIRST AND TEN.
Troy:  KEEP AN EYE ON THE
CENTER AND THEY'VE GOTTEN GOOD
DEALING WITH CROWD NOISE, THESE
TEAMS THAT ARE PLAYING ON THE
ROAD, AND YOU BETTER BE GOOD AT
IT WHEN YOU'RE FACING THIS
DEFENSIVE PASS RUSH AND THEY
HAVE A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT
WAYS IN WHICH THE BALL GETS
SNAPPED FOR THAT REASON TO, TRY
TO KEEP THESE EDGE RUSHERS FROM
HAVING AN ADVANTAGE.
Joe:  CHARLIE HECK WAS
AWFULLY CLOSE TO A FALSE START
HIMSELF.
HERE'S WHITE ON FIRST AND TEN.
HE IS ABLE TO PICK UP ABOUT 5,
5 1/2.
HERE'S WHAT YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT WITH REGARD TO THE SILENT
COUNT.
Troy:  SOMETIMES IT WILL BE
THE GUARD THAT IS THE ONE WHO
IS THE INDICATOR TO EVERYONE AS
TO WHEN THE BALL'S GOING TO BE
SNAPPED AND THEN SOMETIMES IT'S
THE CENTER WHO TAKES A LOOK AND
THEN HE'S THE INDICATOR AS TO
WHEN THE BALL IS GOING TO BE
SNAPPED AND THEN THERE'S
VARIATIONS IN BETWEEN, JUST TO
TRY TO KEEP THE DEFENSE MUCH
LIKE YOU WOULD IN BASEBALL WITH
SIGNALS.
Joe:  HERE'S EGBUKA ON THAT
LITTLE PUSH PASS, SPINS FOR A
FIRST DOWN.
EMEKA EGBUKA SHOWING HIS
TOUGHNESS, HAD TWO TOUCHDOWN
CATCHES IN HIS FIRST NFL GAME
LAST WEEK IN ATLANTA.
HE HAD TO FIGHT FOR FOUR YARDS
AND A FIRST DOWN HERE.
Troy:  HE DID, BUT RACHAAD
WHITE, I TELL YOU HE WAS OUT
THERE AND HE'S THROWING HIS
BODY IN THERE TRYING TO HELP
THEM OUT.
THIS YOUNG MAN HAD A HECK OF AN
OPENING DAY.
Joe:  I MEAN IT'S NO SHOCK
THAT YET ANOTHER OHIO STATE
RECEIVER IS A STUD IN THE NFL,
LOOKS THAT WAY, 19th OVERALL
PICK, GREAT ATHLETE, GOOD
BASEBALL PLAYER, FIRST DOWN,
QUICK SETUP AND THROW AND A
NICE PLAY BY STINGLEY AS HE
KNOCKS IT AWAY FROM MIKE EVANS.
Troy:  THIS IS KIND OF FOUR-
ACROSS DEFENSE AS WELL, SO HE'S
NOT GETTING HELP.
STINGLEY DOESN'T GET INTO A
BACK PEDAL.
HE'S ANTICIPATING A QUICK
BREAKING ROUTE AND IMMEDIATELY
DRIVES ON THE FOOTBALL.
I'M SURE MIKE EVANS THOUGHT
THAT WAS GOING TO BE AN EASY
COMPLETION BASED ON ALIGNMENT.
Joe:  HERE'S IRVING
BOUNCING, BROKE ONE TACKLE AS
HE GOT AWAY FROM HUNTER AND IS
DOWN JUST OUTSIDE THE 15, THIRD
DOWN COMING UP AFTER A GAIN OF
FOUR.
Troy:  WELL, BIG THIRD DOWN
HERE AND THIS HAS BEEN A DOWN
TAMPA BAY HAS DOMINATED.
LAST YEAR THEY WERE THE BEST IN
THE LEAGUE, CONVERTED 50% OF
THEIR THIRD DOWNS AND IT'S HARD
TO IMAGINE THAT THEY COULD
REPEAT THAT.
THEY DID LAST WEEK AND THEY
CONVERTED 50% AGAINST ATLANTA
AND HERE TONIGHT THEY'RE 3 FOR
3. SO THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY IF
THEY'RE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING
WITH IT, WHETHER THEY'RE GOING
TO TRY TO SCORE A TOUCHDOWN OR
THREE.
Joe:  PLAY CLOCK AT FIVE,
EGBUKA LOOKING FOR A BLOCK, GOT
IT, EMEKA EGBUKA TOUCHDOWN
TAMPA BAY.
HE GOT THE BLOCK FROM CHARLIE
HECK, THE VETERAN TACKLE TAKING
OVER FOR GOEDEKE AND BIG NUMBER
77 GOT OUT THERE AND GOT IN THE
WAY AT LEAST AND LET EGBUKA DO
THE REST.
Troy:  HE GOT JUST ENOUGH OF
KAMARI LASSITER, WATCH BIG
CHARLIE HECK.
AS HE COMES OUT, THIS IS THE
EASY TRYING TO BLOCK A GUY LIKE
LASSITER IN THE OPEN SPACE, BUT
HE GETS ENOUGH AND THEN EGBUKA
IS JUST HOPING MAUCH GETS
MOVING SO HE CAN GET IN BEHIND
HIM.
Joe:  THE EXTRA POINT BY
McLAUGHLIN IS KNOCKED THROUGH
AND IT'S A 14-10 GAME, TAMPA
BAY ON TOP.
SO THEY DON'T HAVE THEIR
STARTING TACKLES.
THEY ALREADY LOST GOEDEKE IN
THE GAME.
HECK DID ENOUGH.
EGBUKA DID THE REST AND ON THE
ROAD TRYING TO GET TO 2-0 FO YORK, THE SIX YEAR
VETERAN CHARLIE HECK MAY HAVE
GOTTEN AWAY WITH ON
THE SIX-YEAR VETERAN,
CHARLIE HECK, MAY HAVE GOTTEN
AWAY WITH ONE ON THE TOUCHDOWN.
HE EXTENDS HIS LEG AND TRIPS
THE DEFENDER.
SHOULD HAVE BEEN A FOUL 15
YARDS FROM THE SPOT OF THAT
TRIP.
Joe:  AS HE GETS LASSITER
AND STOPS LASSITER FROM HAVING
A CHANCE AT THE TACKLE.
92% OF HIS CAREER OFFENSIVE
PLAYS OF CHARLIE HECK HAVE COME
FOR THE TEXANS, BUT FOR TAMPA
BAY AS HE'S KIND OF LAST MAN
STANDING AT TACKLE GOT AWAY
WITH ONE AND ALLOWED EGBUKA TO
GET INTO THE END ZONE AND PUT
TAMPA BAY ON TOP.
Troy:  YEAH.
DIDN'T CATCH THAT INITIALLY,
BUT DEFINITELY WAS A TRIP.
Joe:  HERE IS A RETURN BY
NOEL.
HE GETS HIT HARD AS THAT PLAY
WAS MADE BY KAEVON MERRIWEATHER
AND LET'S SEND IT DOWN TO LISA
SALTERS.
Lisa:  YOU CAN HEAR IT IN
C.J.
STROUD'S VOICE WHEN YOU TALK TO
HIM.
HE'S NOT SATISFIED WITH JUST
BEING A GOOD TEAM, WINNING A
PLAYOFF TEAM.
HE WANTS TO WIN IT ALL.
HE SAID HE'S TIRED OF WALKING
UP THE FIELD AFTER A PLAYOFF
LOSS FEELING HORRIBLE THINKING
THEY COULD HAVE DONE THIS OR
THAT BETTER.
THAT'S WHY HE WANTS THERE TO BE
URGENCY IN THE BUILDING RIGHT
NOW.
HE SAID, "WE HAVE A TALENTED
GROUP, BUT WE HAVE TO GO OUT
AND PROVE IT EVERY WEEK."
Joe:  YEAH, LISA, AND FOR A
QUARTERBACK WHO WAS OFFENSIVE
ROOKIE OF THE YEAR IN '23 --
THAT SHOULD BE A FLAG, TWO GUYS
MOVING AT THE SAME TIME AND
THERE IS A FLAG.
YOU CAN SEE C.J.
YELLING AT HIS GUYS COMING BACK
TO THE HUDDLE IS JAKOB JOHNSON
WHO WAS BROUGHT UP AGAIN FROM
THE PRACTICE SQUAD, WAS MOVING
WHEN HE SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN.
TAMPA BAY DECLINES THE PENALTY
AND THEY'LL TAKE THE PLAY, LOSS
OF TWO AND LOSS OF DOWNS,
SECOND DOWN AND 12.
GOOD PROTECTION AGAIN.
STROUD FINALLY FINDS A MAN.
IT'S HUTCHINSON OUT OF BOUNDS
NEAR THE 40 AND STROUD HAD ALL
DAY.
THERE WAS NO PASS RUSH
WHATSOEVER AND WIDE OPEN WAS
HUTCHINSON FOR 20.
Troy:  YEAH.
YOU GIVE ANY QUARTERBACK IN
THIS LEAGUE THAT KIND OF TIME
THEY'RE GOING TO CARVE YOU UP
AND C.J.
STROUD IS NO EXCEPTION AND
HERE'S HUTCHINSON WHO HAS
GOTTEN INVOLVED A FEW TIMES
ALREADY IN THIS BALLGAME.
HE'S NOT A HIGH VOLUME
RECEIVER, BUT HE KEEPS WORKING.
HE ALSO HAD NICO COLLINS
RUNNING DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE
FIELD AND THEY TURN HIM LOOSE
AS HE GETS IN BETWEEN THE
HATCHES, BUT AGAIN, WITH C.J.
STROUD BACK THERE AND THAT'S
THE QUESTION, YOU KNOW.
CALIJAH KANCEY CAN BRING IT ON
THE INSIDE.
VITA VEA CAN FOR HIS SIZE.
Joe:  PLAY ACTION, BLITZ
COMING, STROUD ABLE TO GET OUT
OF THERE AND THEN FLOAT IT AND
HIS RECEIVER FELL DOWN.
Troy:  HAD A CHANCE FOR A
BIG PLAY.
Joe:  THE BLITZ BY THE
ROOKIE BENJAMIN MORRISON AND
STROUD HAD TO GET AROUND IT AND
THEY HAD A BIG PLAY WAITING FOR
HIM IF SCHULTZ STAYS UP.
Troy:  IF SCHULTZ IS ABLE TO
KEEP HIS FEET, HE MAKES ONE GUY
MISS, HE MAY SCORE -- OR EXCUSE
ME, THAT'S HARRISON BRYAN.
Joe:  I LED YOU DOWN THAT
PATH.
Troy:  THAT WAS ONE OF THE
BEST TIGHT END ROOMS IN ALL OF
FOOTBALL AND THEY'VE BEEN
DECIMATED BY INJURY.
Joe:  STROUD HAS TO PULL IT
DOWN, ABLE TO FIND CHUBB IN THE
BACKFIELD AND HE'S WRAPPED UP
IN A TACKLE BY ANTOINE WINFIELD
JR.
Troy:  TALK ABOUT TIGHT
ENDS, LAST WEEK THEY LOSE CADE
STOVER AND HAD BEEN WITHOUT IRV
SMITH, BREVIN JORDAN AND THEY
SIGNED HARRISON BRYANT OFF THE
PRACTICE SQUAD TO THE ACTIVE
ROSTER THIS WEEK.
Joe:  CHRISTIAN KIRK WHO
THEY BROUGHT IN FROM
JACKSONVILLE IS OUT THE SECOND
STRAIGHT GAME WITH A BAD
HAMSTRING.
THEY CAN'T WAIT TO GET HIM
BACK.
THIRD AND EIGHT.
BAD THROW.
THAT WAS DALTON SCHULTZ AND THE
THROW WAS BEHIND HIM.
IT'S FOURTH DOWN.
Troy:  YEAH.
JUST A MISCOMMUNICATION BETWEEN
THOSE TWO GUYS.
STROUD THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO
DO SOMETHING TOTALLY DIFFERENT.
Joe:  TANK DELL, THE GUY AT
THE TOP, IS PROBABLY THE MOST
TALENTED ON THAT LIST.
THEY DON'T KNOW FOR SURE HE'S
GOING TO PLAY COMING BACK FROM
A BIG KNEE INJURY LAST YEAR.
CALIJAH KANCEY IS NOW WALKING
OFF.
Troy:  THAT'S A BLOW.
WE'RE GOING TO GO. BAKER.
BAKER TOUCHDOWN MAKER. THAT'S
WHAT HE'S DONE SINCE COMING TO
TAMPA BAY 72 PASS
WE'LL GO BAKER BAKER, 72
PASS TOUCHDOWNS, WHICH ENTERING
THE WEEK WAS NUMBER ONE IN THE
LEAGUE.
SEE WHAT HE'S DONE ON DEEP
THROWS.
17 OF THOSE TOUCHDOWNS ON 20-
PLUS YARD THROWS AND HE'S ALSO
THE HEAD COACH BAKER.
HIS LAST TWO OFFENSIVE
COORDINATORS ARE NOW HEAD
COACHES IN THE NFL, TALKING
ABOUT DAVIS CANALES IN CAROLINA
AND LIAM COHEN IN JACKSONVILLE.
Troy:  BETTER GET HIS RESUME
GOING.
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?
Joe:  EXACTLY.
ON FIRST DOWN WHITE, A NICE
CARRY AS HE GETS SEVEN.
MAYFIELD IS BACK IN FIRST IN
THE LEAGUE OVER THE LAST THREE
YEARS BECAUSE HE'S GETTING THE
BALL OUT QUICK AND HE'S GOT A
COUPLE OF TOUCHDOWN PASSES.
Troy:  HE HAS FOUND HIMSELF
A HOME IN TAMPA.
I'VE BEEN AS PROUD OF HIM AS
ANYBODY AND WHAT HE'S BEEN ABLE
TO DO AND ENDURED THE EARLY
PART OF HIS CAREER AND TONIGHT
HE'S BEEN REALLY GOOD, HAVING
SOME TIME IN THE POCKET.
THERE'S THE TOUCHDOWN, THIRD
READ IN THE PROGRESSION.
WHEN HE'S HAD TO GET THE BALL
OUT, HE HAS.
WHEN HE'S HAD TO SCRAMBLE AND
MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN, HE'S
BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT AS WELL.
HE LED THE TEAM IN RUSHING LAST
WEEK.
HE DOESN'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN
TONIGHT AND IT'S NOT GOING TO
AS LONG AS THEY KEEP GIVING IT
TO BUCKY IRVING.
Joe:  BAKER MAYFIELD IS ONE
OF THE TOP COMEBACK STORIES IN
YEARS.
HE SIGNED A ONE-YEAR PROVE IT
DEAL TO COMPETE WITH KYLE
TRASK.
HE WAS THE NUMBER ONE OVERALL
PICK BY CLEVELAND IN 2018.
CLEVELAND HAD TO PUT MONEY IN
THE DEAL TO GET HIM TO
CAROLINA.
THEY LET HIM GO.
HE GOES TO THE RAMS AND YOU
THINK IT'S OVER FOR THIS
HEISMAN TROPHY WINNER AND NOW
HE'S A HIGH DOLLAR QUARTERBACK
AND AS EFFECTIVE AS ANYBODY IN
THE LEAGUE.
FLAGS FLY BEFORE A FIRST AND
TEN.
Troy:  I KNOW BAKER FROM
BACK WHEN HE WAS AT OKLAHOMA
AND WATCHING HIM.
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IT, JOE.
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU CAN MEET
BAKER MAYFIELD AND NOT JUST
LOVE THE GUY, EVERYTHING ABOUT
HIM.
HIS TEAMMATES LOVE HIM, I
TOTALLY GET IT.
HE'S AN OLD SCHOOL GUY.
ALL HE WANTS TO DO IS WIN AND
HE'LL DO ANYTHING IT TAKES TO
WIN.
HE'S GOT A LINEMAN'S MENTALITY
AT QUARTERBACK AND THIS GUY IS
A FEROCIOUS COMPETITOR.
Joe:  FIRST DOWN AND 15,
WHITE DUCKS ONE TACKLE AND THEN
DOWN HE GOES.
SHELDON RANKINS, WHO HE FIRST
GOT AROUND, COMES BACK IN TO
MAKE THE STOP AND A LOSS OF
ONE.
Troy:  THIS DEFENSE, DeMECO
RYANS, WE SAW IT WHEN HE WAS
DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR IN SAN
FRANCISCO.
WE'VE SEEN IT SINCE HE CAME TO
HOUSTON.
IT'S THE WAY IN WHICH HE
PLAYED.
THIS IS A RELENTLESS GROUP AND
THEY FLY AROUND.
YOU SEE IT FROM SAN FRANCISCO
AND A COUPLE OTHERS.
THERE'S NOT A LOT OF DEFENSES
WHEN YOU PUT ON THE TAPE THAT
THEY JUST JUMP OFF THE SCREEN
WHEN YOU WATCH THEM, BUT THIS
HOUSTON TEXANS GROUP, THEY SURE
DO.
Joe:  SECOND DOWN AND 16,
MAYFIELD, TIME RUNS OUT, FLAG
ON THE PLAY, RANKINS ALL OVER
BAKER MAYFIELD.
DYLAN HORTON IN THERE AS WELL
AND A LOSS OF NINE IF THE PLAY
STANDS.
THAT'S AGAINST DYLAN HORTON WHO
WORKED HIS WAY INTO THE FIVE-
MAN DEFENSIVE END ROTATION.
HE WAS IN ON THAT SACK OF
MAYFIELD, BUT HE GOT HIS HANDS
UP.
THEY COLLAPSED THIS ENTIRE
POCKET.
Troy:  THERE'S THE LEFT HAND
UP TO THE HEADGEAR.
IT'S A GOOD CALL, BUT BAKER,
THAT WAS THE TIME AND THE WAY
THE POCKET COLLAPSED ON HIM, HE
KNEW HE WAS RUNNING OUT OF
TIME, BUT THERE WAS REALLY
NOWHERE FOR HIM TO GO.
Joe:  WOULD HAVE BEEN THIRD
AND 25.
INSTEAD IT'S FIRST AND TEN AND
PENALTIES A BIG PART OF THE
STORY LAST WEEK FOR HOUSTON IN
THAT LOSS TO THE RAMS AND
SOMETHING WE WILL TRACK AS THIS
GAME UNFOLDS.
MEANWHILE THE TEXANS' DEFENSE
IS PLAYING WITHOUT JALEN PITRE,
ONE OF THE BEST NICKEL
DEFENSIVE BACKS IN THE LEAGUE,
QUESTIONABLE WITH A RIB INJURY.
Troy:  HE'S AN EXCELLENT
PLAYER.
HE MOVED TO THE SLOT CORNER
NICKEL POSITION LAST YEAR AND
EXCELLED AND STEPPED IN THIS
YEAR PICKING UP WHERE HE LEFT
OFF.
Joe:  SECOND AND EIGHT,
MAYFIELD HAD TO PULL IT DOWN
AND DOWN HE GOES.
DANIELLE HUNTER GETS HIS FIRST
OF THE YEAR.
Troy:  YOU CAN SEE DANIELLE
HUNTER COMING OFF THE BALL AND
GRAHAM BARTON, THIS IS WHAT WE
TALKED ABOUT.
WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING AGAINST AN
ATHLETIC GUY LIKE HUNTER, HE
STARTED AS THOUGH HE WAS GOING
TO RUSH INSIDE AND GOES TO THE
OUTSIDE WITH THAT QUICKNESS HE
HAS AND JUST GETS RIGHT BY
BARTON.
Joe:  NOW THIRD AND 16 AFTER
THE SACK.
Troy:  AND THE SILENT COUNT
HOW THEY MIX IT UP IS REALLY
VITAL RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THIS
CROWD IS DEAFENING.
Joe:  EXTRA MAN ON THE RUSH,
EGBUKA OUT ON THE EDGE, FOURTH
DOWN.
AL-SHAAIR CAME IN TO MAKE THAT
STOP, A GAIN OF SEVEN, AND NOW
WE'LL HAVE A RILEY DIXON
SIGHTING, FIRST PUNT FOR TAMPA
BAY OF THE NIGHT WITH JAYLIN
NOEL WAITING FOR IT.
Troy:  NEW SET OF DOWNS AND
THEN FORCE THREE MORE PLAYS AND
A PUNT.
Joe:  GOOD PUNT DRIVES NOEL
BACK, OUT OF BOUNDS AT THE 30,
59-YARD PUNT, 14-YARD RETURN.
ON THAT SECOND DOWNPLAY, BAKER
MAYFIELD WENT DOWN.
DANIELLE HUNTER GOT HIM AND
THEN BAKER WAS GRABBING THAT
LEFT LEG, ABLE TO BE REUNITED
BETWEEN JIM HARBAUGH AND PETE
CARROLL WHO DON'T REALLY --
IT'S NOT PRETTY WITH THOSE TWO.
Troy:  THEY CAN'T GET AWAY
FROM EACH OTHER.
Joe:  NO.
Troy:  THEY'RE CONSTANTLY IN
THE SAME CONFERENCE, THE SAME
DIVISION, KEEP GOING HEAD TO
HEAD.
Joe:  PETE CARROLL TURNING
74 TODAY, THE YOUNGEST 74-YEAR-
OLD IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD
OFFICIALLY.
FIRST DOWN FROM THE 30 AND A
HANDOFF IS TO THE ROOKIE MARKS,
NICE GAIN ON FIRST DOWN, A GAIN
OF SIX.
CALIJAH KANCEY IS QUESTIONABLE
TO RETURN.
HERE'S WHERE HE GOT HURT AND
THEY'RE SAYING IT'S A PEC
INJURY AND THIS IS HIM NOT ABLE
TO FINISH THE PLAY.
WE SAW HIM LEAVE THE FIELD A
MOMENT AGO.
Troy:  OH, MAN, WHAT A GOOD
PLAYER HE IS, TOO, NOW IN HIS
THIRD SEASON AND COMING OFF A
BIG GAME LAST WEEK AND DOING
SOME GOOD THINGS IN THIS ONE.
I MENTIONED IT A LITTLE
EARLIER, YOU GOT HAASON
REDDICK, BUT CAN THEY GET THE
EDGE PRESSURE?
THEY'VE GOT VITA VEA AND
CALIJAH KANCEY, BUT NOW WITHOUT
HIM, IT'S A BIG BLOW TO THIS
TODD BOWLES' DEFENS
ADAM SCHEFTER. AND JUST BEFORE
WE HIT AIR. THERE WAS NEWS THAT
J.J. MCCARTHY HAS GOT A BAD
ANKLE AND HE COULD MISS THEIR
NEXT GAME. ON TOP OF THAT. SO
DANIELS WITH A KNEE AND THEN A
SURGERY UPCOMING IT APPEARS FOR
JOE BURROW WHICH WILL TAKE AWAY
THE NEXT THREE MONTHS FOR THE
CINCINNATI BENGALS. SO WE WILL
HAVE IN A BIG GAME WEEK FOR
COMING UP IN DENVER WITH JAKE
BROWNING AT QUARTERBACK. WE'LL
SECOND AND THREE.
18.
STROUD CAN'T FIND ANYWHERE
TO GO EXCEPT TUCK IT AND RUN
AND STILL ON HIS FEET. NICE RUN
INTO TAMPA BAY TERRITORY AS
HE'S ABLE TO GETE YOUR
STARTER THAT THAT PERMEATES
THROUGH THE BUILDING. AND CAN
THESE BACKUPS STEP IN AND HOLD
IT TOGETHER FOR WHEN SOME OF
THESE GUYS MIGHT RETURN. BLITZ
FROM DENNIS. HE GOT PICKED UP.
AND DALTON SCHULTZ MAKES THE
CATCH FOR A GAIN OF FOUR. C.J.
STROUD IN THIS GAME TONIGHT
FOUR COMPLETIONS OF 20 PLUS
YARDS TO FOUR DIFFERENT
RECEIVERS. THERE'S DENNIS
GETTING DUMPED BY THE ROOKIE
WOODY MARKS. WELL, THAT WAS A
PART OF THEIR ATTACK IN PRIOR
YEARS WAS THE BIG PLAY. SECOND
AND SIX STROUD CAN'T GET AWAY.
THIS TIME IT'S GAINES. AND THE
FORMER RAMS DEFENSIVE TACKLE
GETS HIS FIRST SACK OF THE YEAR.
JUST A GREAT JOB UP FRONT.
LAKEN TOMLINSON THE LEFT GUARD.
HE GETS RUN OVER AND WITH A
FOUR MAN RUSH C.J. STROUD JUST
HAS NOWHERE TO GO WITH THE
FOOTBALL. THEY WERE ON HIM
QUICK. TAMPA BAY USES A,
FELLAS.
SO, AFTER THE TIMEOUT, 46
SECONDS LEFT. THIRD DOWN AND 14.
HOUSTON. BLITZ AGAIN. STROUD IN
TROUBLE. DENNIS NOW IN HIS FACE.
AND THIS ONE IS DOWNFIELD AND
INCOMPLETE. FOR NICO COLLINS.
AND THAT'LL BRING UP FOURTH
DOWN. AND THERE'S TIME ON THE
CLOCK FOR TAMPA BAY TO TRY TO
ADD TO THEIR LEAD. WELL THEY
BRING THE BLITZ FROM DEP JACOB
PARRISH THE ROOKIE. YOU SEE HIM
NUMBER 25. HERE HE COMES. HE
STUMBLES AS HE'S TRYING TO GET
THROUGH THE LINE. AND THE
DEFENSE TRYING TO RUN OUT
UNDERNEATH SOME OF THESE THROWS
HERE WAS ONCE HE GOT OUTSIDE
THE POCKET TRYING TO SEE IF HE
COULDN'T MAKE A PLAY. BUT GOOD
COVERAGE BEHIND THAT BLITZ FROM
TAMPA BAY THAT DIDN'T ALLOW
STROUD TO GET THE BALL OUT
QUICK. SO NICO COLLINS GET HIS
FOOT STEPPED ON AS HE CAME OUT
OF THAT BREAK. HERE'S THE PUNT
BY TOWNSEND. JOHNSON LETS IT GO
OVER HIS HEAD AND INTO THE END
ZONE IT GOES. 30S LEFT. TWO
TIME-OUTS FOR TAMPA BAY UP BY
FOUR AND THEY'LL TAKE OVER AT
THEIR 20. WELL THIS HAS BEEN AN
ENTERTAINING FIRST HALF, AND
NOW WE'LL SEE IF ON THE ROAD,
TAMPA BAY CAN DO SOMETHING HERE
BEFORE THE HALF. AND THEY GET
THE BALL TO START THE SECOND
HALF. YEAH. IT'S IT STARTED OUT
AS AN OFFENSIVE EXPLOSION WHICH
BOTH OF THESE OFFENSES WERE
HOPING FOR. AND THE DEFENSE HAS
SINCE THEN KIND OF SETTLED IN.
AND NOW IT'S BEEN A BIT OF A
DEFENSIVE BATTLE AS WE'VE MOVED
THROUGH THE REST OF THIS FIRST
HALF. BUT WE'LL SEE. SEE WHAT
O'SHEA BANKS GOT UP HIS SLEEVE
HERE TALKING ABOUT BAKER
MAYFIELD. THAT'S RIGHT. READY
TO GO TO WORK DOWN HERE. SEE,
THE YARDS ARE DEAD. EVEN THE
SCOREBOARD POINTS ARE NOT.
THESE TEXANS DEFENDERS ARE
GOING TO BE COMING AFTER
MAYFIELD AS EVANS MAKES THE
CATCH. AND HE GOT KNOCKED. THAT
TIMEOUT IS TAKEN RIGHT AWAY
BEFORE A SECOND. AND ONE THAT
HIT THAT WE SHOWED OF BAKER
MAYFIELD. AND IT LOOKED LIKE IT
COULD HAVE BEEN A SIGNIFICANT
INJURY TO THAT LEFT KNEE. AND
FOR HIM TO BE BACK IN THE
LINEUP THAT'S THAT'S GOOD TO
SEE. WELL YOU WONDERED IF DEREK
STINGLEY WOULD SEE A LOT OF
MIKE EVANS TONIGHT. AND THE
ANSWER IS YES. HE'S BEEN ACROSS
FROM BIG NUMBER 13 REALLY SINCE
THE GAME BEGAN. YEAH. HE'S
DOING WHAT HE DID LAST WEEK
AGAINST DAVANTE ADAMS. AND NOT
REALLY SOMETHING THAT THEY
ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO DO BECAUSE
KAMARI LASSITER NUMBER FOUR ON
THE OPPOSITE SIDE I MEAN HE'S
HE'S ABOUT JUST AS GOOD. SECOND
AND ONE MAYFIELD IN TROUBLE AND
ABLE TO JUST GET RID OF IT IN
THE DIRECTION OF ORTON. WITH
PRESSURE BY ANDERSON AND HUNTER.
THE TWO DEFENSIVE ENDS. YOU
THINK ABOUT THE FLEXIBILITY
THAT THAT YOU KNOW THIS DEFENSE
GIVES DEMECO RYANS AS THE
DEFENSIVE PLAY CALLER. THAT ONE
YOU'VE GOT THESE GREAT EDGE
RUSHERS. YOU'VE GOT SOME
INTERIOR GUYS. LINEBACKERS ARE
PHYSICAL AND AGGRESSIVE. THEN
YOU'VE GOT THESE TWO
OUTSTANDING CORNERS AS WELL,
AND IT ALLOWS YOU TO JUST DO A
LOT OF THINGS. AND SO YEAH, GET
THE BALL OUT QUICK. BUT AGAINST
THIS GROUP IN GENERAL, YOU'RE
GOING TO HAVE A HARD TIME WITH
THESE CORNERS BECAUSE THEY
DON'T GIVE UP MUCH SPACE.
THEY'VE GOT A TIMEOUT. THEY'VE
GOT TO PICK UP THE FIRST DOWN
MAYFIELD FOR EVANS AND EVANS
OVERTHROWN BY A LOT. PRESSURE
BY DANIELLE HUNTER. AND NOW
THESE DEFENSIVE ENDS ARE
STARTING TO TEE OFF ON THIS
OFFENSIVE LINE OF THE BUCS. AND
A NICE JOB THERE BY DEMECO
RYANS TOTALLY CHANGED UP THE
LOOK. THEY'VE BEEN MAN ENOUGH.
IT LOOKS LIKE MAN HERE. BUT YOU
GOT HELP AT SAFETY AND IT'S A
ZONE COVERAGE. SO YOU GOT BAKER
INITIALLY THINKING OKAY I GOT
TWO DEEP WITH MAN
WITH MAN UNDERNEATH.
THEY WERE IN A ZONE COVERAGE
AND STINGLEY WAS UNDERNEATH IT.
Joe:  TOWNSEND JUST GOT IT
AWAY AS THIS BALL CHECKS UP
JUST INSIDE THE 30 WITH TWO
SECONDS LEFT.
SO WE ARE ONE SNAP AWAY FROM
HALFTIME.
Troy:  I DON'T KNOW HOW HE
GOT THAT BALL OFF.
Joe:  YEAH, IT WAS CLOSE.
Troy:  SURE WAS.
Joe:  JAKE HANSEN GOT
THROUGH AND ALMOST, LOOK AT UP IN AIR AND THAT JUST WENT PAST HIS ARM.
Troy:  SPEAKING OF PUNTERS,
YOU'VE GOT RIGOBERTO ON A TWO-
WEEK VACATION IN INDIANAPOLIS.
Joe:  THE COLTS CAN'T BE
STOPPED.
THEY HAVE NO TURNOVERS AND NO
PUNTS AND THEY'RE 2-0 AS THEY
TOOK CARE OF THE DENVER BRONCOS
YESTERDAY AND DOWN TO LISA.
Lisa:  YOU SCORED ON THE
OPENING DRIVE, WHAT HAS SLOWED
DOWN OFFENSIVELY SINCE THEN?
WE GOT TO KEEP MAKING
PRODUCTIVE PLAYS.
THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO STAY ON
THE FIELD THIRD DOWN.
WE'VE GOT TO GET OFF
DEFENSIVELY AND FOR US ON THIRD
DOWN WE'VE GOT TO GET IN MORE
MANAGEABLE SITUATIONS WHERE WE
CAN STAY ON AND CONTINUE TO NO GROUND GAME AGAIN
THIS WEEK AND C.J.
STROUD BEING THE LEADING
RUSHER.
SO THAT'S GOING TO AFFECT THEM
AS WE MOVE THROUGH THE REST OF
THIS BALLGAME AS WELL.
Joe:  FAIRBAIRN WITH A LINE
DRIVE, THIS IS TUCKER ON THE
RETURN, THIRD-STRING RUNNING
BACK ABLE TO GET IT ACROSS THE
25 AND THAT IS IT.
TONIGHT'S TOTAL REPLAY IS
BROUGHT TO YOU BY UNITED
AIRLINES AND HERE IS HOW THOSE
DEFENSIVE ENDS ARE GETTING
AFTER BAKER.
Troy:  THAT'S THE FOCAL
POINT WHEN YOU COME IN AGAINST
THE HOUSTON TEXANS.
THERE YOU GOT HUNTER WITH WILL
ANDERSON AND BOTH OF THEM
COLLAPSING THE POCKET.
THAT'S WHERE IT ALL STARTS.
YOU BETTER HAVE ANSWERS FOR
THEM.
YOU SEE THEY AREN'T GIVING
THESE GUYS MUCH HELP ON THE
OUTSIDE.
THEY'RE PRETTY MUCH ASKED TO
TRY TO BLOCK THEM ONE ON ONE.
THAT'S A LOT TO ASK OF ANYBODY.
Joe:  FROM THE 28 THEY'LL
START ON THE GROUND WITH IRVING
AND BUCKY IRVING WITH A NICE
GAIN ON FIRST DOWN AS HE GETS
SEVEN.
SO JUST TO REPEAT, THE TAMPA
BAY BUCCANEERS ARE WITHOUT
TRISTAN WIRFS.
HE DID PRACTICE THIS WEEK, BUT
THE FOUR-TIME PRO BOWL LEFT
TACKLE IS NOT READY TO GO, HAD
KNEE SURGERY IN JULY, AND LUKE
GOEDEKE, THEIR OTHER STARTING
TACKLE OUT ON THE RIGHT SIDE,
LEFT IN THE FIRST HALF,
REAGGRAVATING THAT FOOT.
SO THEY'RE DOWN TO GRAHAM
BARTON AT LEFT TACKLE, HIS
SECOND GAME OUT THERE EVER.
HE PLAYED CENTER LAST YEAR AS A
ROOKIE AND CHARLIE HECK AT
RIGHT TACKLE.
NOT MUCH ROOM AT ALL FOR
IRVING.
IT WILL BE THIRD AND
SHORTCOMING UP.
Troy:  IT HELPS WHEN YOU'RE
ABLE TO HAND THE BALL OFF ON
FIRST DOWN AND DIDN'T GET AS
MUCH ON SECOND DOWN, BUT SURE
MAKES IT A MANAGEABLE THIRD
DOWN OF TAMPA BAY WAS EXCELLENT
LAST WEEK IN THAT WIN AGAINST
ATLANTA AND THEY'VE BEEN GOOD
AGAIN TONIGHT ON THIS DOWN.
Joe:  JALEN PITRE WHO WAS
QUESTIONABLE WITH A RIB INJURY
BACK IN FOR HOUSTON.
THAT'S GREAT NEWS FOR DeMECO
RYANS.
IT'S THIRD DOWN AND A LONG ONE.
QUICK SETUP AND THROW AND HE
GOES TO SHEPARD AND THE LONG
TIME NEW YORK GIANT, STERLING
SHEPARD, GETS FIVE.
Troy:  THERE'S KEVIN
CARBERRY WHO I TALKED ABOUT
EARLIER AND THE JOB HE'S DONE
WITH THIS OFFENSIVE LINE, THIS
YEAR ESPECIALLY, BUT LAST YEAR
AS WELL.
Joe:  FAKE THE HANDOFF AND
SHEPARD AGAIN, NICE GAIN ON
FIRST DOWN AS HE'S BROUGHT DOWN
BY BULLOCK, THE SAFETY, GAIN OF
SEVEN.
Troy:  THEY'LL TRY TO SLOW
THIS PASS RUSH DOWN A LITTLE
BIT, UP THE TEMPO OFFENSIVELY,
GET THESE GUYS WHERE THEY'VE
GOT TO START RUNNING SIDELINE
TO SIDELINE, BALL OUT QUICK.
Joe:  BACK TO IRVING, MADE
ONE MAN MISS, BUT TO'OTO'O
DIDN'T.
RIGHT THERE IN THE HOLE AND HE
JUST DROPPED BUCKY IRVING FOR A
LOSS OF ONE.
Troy:  THIS IS WHAT IT'S
LIKE PLAYING LINEBACKER IN THE
NFL.
WATCH HIS EYES AND HOW HE READS
ALL THE ACTION IN THE BACKFIELD
AND THEN HE JUST FIELDS THE
HOLE.
IF YOU DON'T PLAY THAT STYLE OF
AGGRESSIVENESS AND ATTACK, YOU
WON'T PLAY FOR DeMECO RYANS.
THERE'S 11 GUYS, IT DOESN'T
MATTER WHAT POSITION.
LAST WEEK KAMARI LASSITER, WHO
IS ONE OF THE BEST COVER
CORNERS IN FOOTBALL, HE LED THE
TEAM IN TACKLES.
THEY GOT 11 GUYS WHO FLY TO THE
FOOTBALL.
Joe:  THIRD DOWN AND FOUR,
MAYFIELD, TIME RUNS OUT,
TRIPPED UP AND DOWN HE GOES.
IT'S FOURTH DOWN AND IT WAS
SHELDON RANKINS WHO GOT HIS
HAND ON THE LEGS OR THE FOOT OF
MAYFIELD TO GET THE SACK AND A
LOSS OF FOUR.
Troy:  THAT'S A GREAT JOB.
THEY'RE SO HAPPY TO HAVE HIM
BACK.
HE WAS HERE IN 23.
LAST YEAR HE WENT TO CINCINNATI
AND HE'S BACK THIS YEAR AND
WHAT AN ADDED ADDITION HE IS
FOR THIS DEFENSIVE FRONT.
Joe:  NOEL WAITS FOR THE
PUNT FROM DIXON, ONE FIRST DOWN
BY TAMPA BAY ON THAT
POSSESSION.
THAT'S IT.
THIS PUNT IS DEEP INTO THE END
ZONE.
SO THE TEXANS WHO ARE LOOKING
FOR THEIR FIRST WIN OF THE
SEASON IN THEIR HOME OPENER GET
THAT DEFENSIVE PLAY BY SHELDON
RANKINS.
AS TROY SAID, HERBERT TONIGHT AT 10:00
EASTERN IN VEGAS.
Troy:  DAN IS THE HARDEST
WORKING GUY IN TELEVISION.
EVERY TIME I TURN ON ESPN HE'S
ON.
Joe:  WHEN HE'S NOT IN THE
STUDIO, HE GOES ON IN HIS CAR.
Troy:  DON'T KNOW WHEN THE
GUY SLEEPS.
Joe:  LET'S GO TO LAURA
RUTLEDGE WHO KNOWS HOW HARD DAN
WORKS.
Laura:  CALIJAH KANCEY, THE
D-LINEMAN FOR THE BUCS, IS OUT
FOR THE GAME WITH A PECTORAL
INJURY, A MASSIVE BLOW TO THE
BUCS' DEFENSE.
TODD BOWLES SAYS THEY'LL HAVE
TO DO IT WITH A ROTATION OF
GREG GAINES, LOGAN  LOGAN AND
ROBERTS.
Joe:  C.J.
STROUD HITS BIG NUMBER 12 IN
STRIDE FOR 16 YARDS.
Troy:  ZYON McCOLLUM WHO GOT
BEAT FOR THE TOUCHDOWN IS
LOCKED ONE ON ONE.
GOOD ROUTE THERE FOR NICO
COLLINS AND HE GETS INSIDE AND
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF BALL
PLACEMENT AND BEATING IT, BUT
HERE'S THE PICKUP.
NICK CHUBB INSIDE, GOT A CLEAN
LANE THEN ON THE THROW TO
COLLINS.
Joe:  JUST COLLINS' SECOND
CATCH OF THE GAME, THE OTHER
ONE A 29-YARD TOUCHDOWN THAT
MADE IT 7-0. HANDOFF TO CHUBB
AND SirVOCEA DENNIS IS IN THERE
TO MAKE THAT TACKLE, A GAIN OF
TWO.
Troy:  YOU'VE GOT TO BELIEVE
IF HOUSTON IS GOING TO HAVE
SUCCESS, THE BALL HAS TO GET TO
NICO COLLINS.
THE OFFENSE PRETTY MUCH RUNS
THROUGH HIM.
IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE THEM BEING
ABLE TO DO MUCH ON THAT SIDE OF
THE BALL IF HE'S NOT TOUCHING
IT.
Joe:  NO TARGETS TONIGHT FOR
EITHER OF THE HIGH DRAFT PICKS,
JAYLIN NOEL AND JAYDEN HIGGINS,
THE ROOKIES, TEAMMATES AT IOWA
STATE.
ON SECOND AND EIGHT STROUD
STEPS THROUGH, FAKES THE THROW
AND DRAWS A CROWD, THIRD AND
SHORTCOMING UP AS YAYA DIABY
MAKES THE STOP FOR A GAIN OF
SIX, FIRST TIME WE'VE SAID HIS
NAME TONIGHT.
Troy:  A LOT OF THIS OFFENSE
TONIGHT IS C.J.
STROUD SCRAMBLING.
HERE'S A LOOK.
THEY GOT INITIALLY HE'S LOOKING
AT NICO COLLINS.
HE WAS IN THE SLOT.
HE HAD JAKOB JOHNSON WHO WAS
COMING ACROSS ON THE DRAG
ROUTE, NOT A BIG RECEIVING
THREAT, BUT THAT WAS ABOUT THE
ONLY GUY WHO REALLY CREATED ANY
TYPE OF SEPARATION.
Joe:  STROUD IS SACKED ON
THIRD DOWN AND TWO BY TYKEE
SMITH.
SO TODD BOWLES BRINGING
PRESSURE AND THE PROTECTION
BREAKS DOWN.
IT'S FOURTH DOWN.
Troy:  OGUNBOWALE IS IN THE
BACKFIELD AND JUST GETS TRUCKED
RIGHT HERE BY TYKEE SMITH.
I MEAN HE JUST GOES RIGHT
THROUGH HIM AND C.J.
STROUD IS SITTING THERE
THINKING WE'VE GOT THIS PICKED
UP AND BAM.
Joe:  TYKEE PLAYED SLOT LAST
YEAR.
THEY MOVED HIM TO SAFETY BEFORE
THE DRAFT.
HE PLAYED SOME IN COLLEGE AND,
BOY, DID HE BRING IT ON THAT
THIRD AND TWO.
BEAUTIFUL PUNT BY TOWNSEND.
AND IT CHECKS OUT OF BOUNDS
INSIDE THE TEN.
WELL DONE BY TOMMY TOWNSEND.
AND THGET HOOKED
AFTER TONIGHT'S GAME.
IT'S TAMPA BAY'S BALL SITTING
AT THEIR 8. THEY LEAD BY FOUR.
FOR THE BUCCANEERS, THEIR FIRST
STARTING FIELD POSITION.
EACH TEAM SCORED ON THEIR
POSSESSIONS, EACH TEAM THREE
PUNTS SINCE ON FIRST DOWN.
IRVING GOT TWO.
SECOND DOWN AND EIGHT COMING
UP.
THERE ARE THE NUMBERS, FIRST
FOUR DRIVES WE SAW SCORING.
LAST SIX DRIVES WE'VE SEEN
RILEY DIXON AND TOMMY TOWNSEND.
THEY'RE THE PUNTERS.
CROWD'S TRYING TO GET BACK IN
IT, SECOND AND EIGHT.
HANDOFF TO IRVING, GOOD
BLOCKING ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF
THIS OFFENSIVE LINE AND THEN
THE LEGS OF BUCKY IRVING JUST
DRIVING FOR WHAT LOOK TO BE
ENOUGH FOR A FIRST DOWN.
Troy:  IT'S A NICE JOB
OFFENSIVELY.
THE HOUSTON TEXANS SHOWING A
TWO-DEEP SHELL AND THE
BUCCANEERS HAD TWO TIGHT ENDS.
SO THE BALL WAS TURNED OFF TO
BUCKY IRVING.
YOU'VE GOT A FAVORABLE MATCH-UP
IN THE RUN GAME AND THEN HE'S
ABLE TO MAKE THE FIRST DOWN
JUST HANDING IT OFF TO HIM.
Joe:  HE GOT THE FIRST DOWN,
GAIN OF EIGHT.
LITTLE BREATHING ROOM, BALL IS
OUT TO THE 18.
IRVING ON THE HANDOFF, ABLE TO
CROSS THE 20 AS WE SEND IT DOWN
TO LISA.
Lisa:  HEY, JOE.
YOU GUYS WERE TALKING ABOUT
SHELDON RANKINS RETURNING TO
HOUSTON.
NO ONE WAS HAPPIER ABOUT THAT
THAN WILL ANDERSON.
ANDERSON CALLS RANKINS HIS OG.
HE SAYS, "HE WAS MY VET SINCE
MY ROOKIE SEASON," WHEN
ANDERSON WAS TAKEN UNDER
SHELDON RANKINS' WING.
HE SAID EVEN WHEN RANKINS SPENT
LAST SEASON WITH THE BENGALS
AND HE GOT BACK HERE, HE SAID
THE RELATIONSHIP PICKED UP
RIGHT WHERE IT LEFT OFF.
HE SAID JUST HAVING HIM BACK
MAKES HIM FEEL HE CAN PLAY SO
MUCH MORE FREELY.
Joe:  YEAH, LISA, HE'S HAD A
COUPLE BIG PLAYS IN THIS GAME.
SHELDON RANKINS, HERE'S BAKER
MAYFIELD JUST ABLE TO GET RID
OF IT WITH C.J.
GARDNER-JOHNSON TRIPPING HIM.
AND MAYFIELD AVOIDED THE SACK
TO BRING UP THIRD DOWN AND
EIGHT.
Troy:  WELL, THEY BRING THE
SLOT BLITZ AND IT FORCES BAKER
THEN OUT OF THE POCKET BECAUSE
OFF OF PLAY ACTION THEY THOUGHT
THEY WERE GOING TO GET THE ONE
ON ONE.
C.J.
GARDNER-JOHNSON COMES FROM HERE
AND THEY THINK THEY'VE GOT A
CHANCE FOR A BIG PLAY DOWN THE
FIELD, BUT YET THEY'RE JUST NOT
ABLE TO SHORE IT UP.
Joe:  THIRD DOWN AND EIGHT.
ANDERSON GOT A GREAT JUMP OFF
THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE AND THE
PASS BROKEN UP AND STINGLEY WON
THAT BATTLE.
MIKE EVANS THE TARGET AND
STINGLEY WAS RIGHT THERE.
Troy:  YEAH.
THAT'S WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT
EARLIER IN THIS GAME WAS THE
ADVANTAGE HOUSTON HAS.
SO THEY BRING PRESSURE AND NOW
YOU GOT ONE ON ONE, BUT YOU'VE
GOT A CORNER WHO IS ABLE TO
COME UP AND GET LOCKED UP RIGHT
IN THE FACE OF MIKE EVANS AND
YOU SEE JUST GREAT EYE
DISCIPLINE ON STINGLEY'S PART.
HERE'S THE PRESSURE THAT'S
COMING.
BAKER KNOWS HE CAN'T HOLD THE
FOOTBALL VERY LONG, BUT
TYPICALLY WHEN YOU PLAY AGAINST
TEAMS, THEY DON'T HAVE CORNERS
LIKE STINGLEY AND IT'S A LITTLE
BIT OF RUSSIAN ROULETTE FOR A
DEFENSE TO PLAY THAT KIND OF
GAME.
Joe:  DIXON JUST GOT IT AWAY
WITH NOEL GETTING BROUGHT DOWN
IMMEDIATELY.
THAT WAS IZIEN AND CHRISTIAN
IZIEN COVERING T AFC CHAMP GAME IN
FRANCHISE HISTORY DATING BACK
TO 2002.
Troy:  WELL, EVERY YOUNG
PEOPLE GOES THROUGH IT AND
EVENTUALLY YOU GET TO A POINT
AND C.J.
STROUD'S AT THAT POINT NOW
THAT, YOU KNOW, JUST GETTING TO
THE PLAYOFFS, WINNING TEN, 11
GAMES, GETTING TO THE
DIVISIONAL ROUND IT'S NOT
ENOUGH AND IT'S NOT INFORM FOR
DeMECO RYANS EITHER.
Joe:  HERE'S MARKS OFF THE
EDGE.
McCOLLUM CRASHES DOWN TO MAKE
THE TACKLE, GAIN OF THREE.
Troy:  SO YOU TURN AROUND A
PROGRAM LIKE DeMECO RYANS HAS,
THERE'S A LOT TO FEEL GOOD
ABOUT.
THERE'S CAL McNAIR, THE OWNER.
THE PRESSURE ONLY GETS GREATER
AND IT'S GOOD.
IT'S GOOD FOR THE CITY.
IT'S GOOD FOR THE ORGANIZATION
AND THIS TEAM IS CAPABLE OF
DOING IT AND LIKE I SAID,
THAT'S WHY WEEK ONE IS ALWAYS
OVEREMPHASIZED A TOUGH OPENER
FOR THEM.
THIS IS A BIG GAME TONIGHT.
Joe:  STROUD'S IN TROUBLE.
DIABY CHASING HIM, NOW HALL AND
C.J.
STROUD JUST HAS TO GET RID OF
IT.
YAYA DIABY GOT THROUGH AND THEN
LOGAN HALL, THE SECOND ROUND
PICK WHO PLAYED COLLEGIATELY
HERE IN HOUSTON, COULDN'T GET
THERE, BUT FORCED THE THROW AND
IT'S THIRD AND SEVEN.
Troy:  YEAH.
AND LAVONTE DAVID COMES OFF THE
EDGE AS WELL WHEN HE SEES IT
AND HE'S ABLE TO GET HIM MOVING
A LITTLE BIT IN THAT POCKET.
THAT'S KIND OF WHAT TAMPA HAS
HAD TO DO IN ORDER TO GET
PRESSURE ON C.J.
STROUD.
THEY'VE KIND OF HAD TO CREATE
IT, MANUFACTURE IT A LITTLE
BIT.
Joe:  DON'T WANT TO SHORT
CHANGE GREG GAINES GETTING MORE
PLAYING TIME NOW WITH CALIJAH
KANCEY OUT WITH A PEC INJURY.
IT'S THIRD AND SEVEN.
PRESSURE AND A SACK, LAVONTE
DAVID AND THE ROOKIE, ELIJAH
ROBERTS, WAS IN THERE AS WELL.
IT'S FOURTH DOWN AND THE CROWD
BOOING HERE IN HOUSTON.
Troy:  WELL, THEY PUT
SirVOCEA DENNIS AND LAVONTE
DAVID IN THE A GAPS AND YOU
DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE'S COMING.
LAVONTE DAVID LOOKS LIKE HE'S
DROPPING INTO COVERAGE.
THEY EXPECT HIM TO AND HERE HE
COMES RIGHT UP THE GUT AND HE'S
GOT A CLEAN SHOT.
Joe:  LAVONTE DAVID PLAYING
IN HIS 200th CAREER GAME,
NUMBER THREE ON THE ALL-TIME
BUCS LIST.
TOWNSEND HITS IT AGAIN.
HE'S BEEN BUSY.
JOHNSON WAITING FOR IT AND ABLE
TO GET IT TO THE 21.
TWO HALL OF FAMERS IN FRONT OF
DAVID, BARBER AND BROOKS AND IN
CAREER GAME NUMBER TO FEEL GOOD ABOUT,
JALEN SMITH WHO HAS BEEN IN AND
OUT OF THIS GAME, THIRD ROUND
PICK FROM USC, PLAYED IN THE
SNOOP YOUTH FOOTBALL LEAGUE.
SNOOP'S GOT OVER 40 PLAYERS
THAT HAVE COME THROUGH THAT
PROGRAM TO GET TO THE NFL.
THEY CONDUCTED THAT INTERVIEW
TEN YEARS AGO AND HERE HE IS,
THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE,
AS WHAT A THROW.
MIKE EVANS ON A PERFECT THROW
FROM BAKER MAYFIELD WORKING
AGAINST STINGLEY AND YOU JUST
CAN'T DROP IT IN ANY BETTER
THAN THAT.
NO.
MIKE EVANS ABLE TO GET A LITTLE
SEPARATION, WASN'T A WHOLE LOT
TO HIS RELEASE.
HE TAKES OFF OFF THE LINE OF
SCRIMMAGE, BUT HE'S ABLE TO
CREATE AT LEAST A LITTLE
SEPARATION FROM DEREK STINGLEY
AND THE BALL IS THROWN
PERFECTLY BEFORE STINGLEY CAN
EVEN GET HIS HEAD TURNED
AROUND.
Joe:  TAMPA BAY'S LONGEST
PLAY OF THE GAME, JUST THEIR
FIFTH FIRST DOWN OVER THEIR
LAST FIVE POSSESSIONS AS THIS
ONE DRIFTS OUT OF BOUNDS FOR
EVANS AND HEAVY PRESSURE BY
JALEN PITRE WHO WAS COMING ON A
BLITZ, SOMETHING HE DOES VERY
WELL.
Troy:  YES, HE DOES.
HE'S ON A VERY PHYSICAL PLAYER.
I'M A BIG FAN OF WHAT HE'S ABLE
TO DO AND HE COMES COMPLETELY
UNBLOCKED AT THE TOP OF THE
SCREEN AND MAYFIELD WASN'T
ACCOUNTING FOR HIM AND HAD
NOWHERE TO GO WITH THE
FOOTBALL.
Joe:  RACHAAD WHITE COMES
INTO THE BALLGAME.
THEY HAND IT TO HIM, ABLE TO
BREAK LOOSE, GOT PAST THE LINE
OF SCRIMMAGE AND DUCKS OUT OF
BOUNDS WITH THE FIRST DOWN,
NICE RUN BY RACHAAD WHITE AND A
GOOD ONE-TWO PUNCH FOR THE BUCS
AND RUNNING BACK WITH BUCKY
IRVING AND WHITE, WHO JUST GOT
12.
Troy:  YEAH, REALLY NICE.
THAT'S THE BENEFIT I WAS
TALKING ABOUT THAT MAYFIELD HAS
HAD THAT STROUD HAS NOT, THAT
HE'S AT LEAST GOTTEN SOMETHING
OUT OF HIS RUN GAME TO HELP
TAKE SOME OF THE PRESSURE OFF.
YOU'RE SECOND AND LONG AND TO
BE ABLE TO HAND THE BALL OFF
AND GET A NEW SET OF DOWNS IS A
REAL LUXURY IN THIS GAME.
Joe:  BUCCANEERS NOW OVER
100 RUSHING YARDS IN THE GAME
AS THEY HAND TO WHITE, WHAT A
RUN.
ARE YOU KIDDING?
HE GOT ALMOST TEN, MIGHT HAVE
GOTTEN TEN.
THEY'RE GOING TO GIVE HIM 9
1/2.
HE WAS PICKING HIS WAY THROUGH
BODIES FROM THE SECOND HE GOT
THE BALL.
Troy:  JOE, I TALKED ABOUT
HOW HE GETS STRONGER AS THE
GAME GOES ALONG AND YOU SEE IN
THE THIRD QUARTER THE WAY HE
FINISHES THIS RUN HERE.
HE GETS UP IN THERE.
YOU'LL SEE THE CONTACT.
HE GETS A FEW MORE YARDS AFTER
THAT.
Joe:  SECOND AND SHORT THEY
PICK IT UP AND WHITE JUST KEEPS
RUMBLING DOWN NEAR THE 20 WITH.
IT WAS MAYBE A TOUCHDOWN SAVING
TACKLE BY AZEEZ AL-SHAAIR AFTER
A GAIN OF 16 AND NOW HE'S
TACK
C.J.
GARDNER-JOHNSON MISSED A
TACKLE.
AL-SHAAIR
HERE IS THE INJURY FOR TWO-
TIME CAPTAIN AZEEZ AL-SHAAIR AS
HE GETS KIND OF KICKED OR THE
CALF INTO THE FACE MASK, WAS
DOWN FOR A WHILE BUT ABLE TO
GET UP, WALK OFF THE FIELD
UNDER HIS OWN POWER AND NOW
CHRISTIAN HARRIS COMES IN TO
TAKE HIS SPOT, BUT THEY ARE
ROLLING, TAMPA BAY ON THE
GROUND, AND THAT'S THE
DIFFERENCE IN THE BALLGAME HERE
OF LATE.
Troy:  YEAH.
JOSH GRIZZARD, FIRST TIME
CALLING PLAYS LAST WEEK, HE'S
FIGURING THIS THING OUT.
YOU GOT BUCKY IRVING IN THE
BACKFIELD RUNNING THE BALL THE
WAY HE IS.
JUST KEEP FEEDING IT TO HIM.
Joe:  THEY'VE HAD IRVING AND
WHITE.
WHITE IS BACK IN THERE AND WHY
NOT?
THEY GO TO HIM AND THIS TIME
HOUSTON STUFFS IT.
JUST TO PUT NUMBERS AND A
VISUAL TO WHAT TROY WAS TALKING
ABOUT EARLIER IN THE FIRST
HALF, THE BUCCANEERS BETWEEN
'22 AND '23 THEY WERE WORST IN
THE LEAGUE RUNNING THE BALL.
LAST YEAR THEY WERE FOURTH AND
RIGHT NOW THEY'RE UP OVER 100
YARDS IN THE GAME COMPARED TO
52 FOR HOUSTON.
Troy:  THERE'S OLD JOSH
GRIZZARD WHO YOU SAID FROM
LIZARD LICK, NORTH CAROLINA.
YOU KNOW THEY'RE ALL TUNED IN
WATCHING TONIGHT.
Joe:  ON SECOND DOWN AND
NINE, MAYFIELD, EGBUKA, CAN'T
GET TO IT.
Troy:  WE SAW EGBUKA GETTING
WRAPPED ON THE SIDELINE A FEW
MOMENTS AGO AND HE'S TRYING TO
GET TO THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD
AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S
HINDERING HIM IN ANY WAY AT
ALL, BUT DIDN'T LOOK LIKE HE
GOT THERE QUITE AS QUICKLY,
PRETTY TIGHT WRAP THAT HE HAS.
YOU SEE THE DOUBLE MOVE.
HE'S JUST NOT ABLE TO QUITE GET
ACROSS.
Joe:  THERE HE IS GETTING
WRAPPED EARLIER IN THIS SECOND
HALF.
THEY'RE ALREADY WITHOUT CHRIS
GODWIN AND JALEN McMILLAN.
THIRD DOWN AND NINE.
MAYFIELD END ZONE, EVANS
SPINNING TRY, INCOMPLETE AND
WILL ANDERSON HAD PRESSURE ON
BAKER MAYFIELD, FORCED THAT
THROW.
IT'S FOURTH DOWN.
Troy:  THAT'S A TIGHT THROW
AND THERE'S JUST NO REAL ESTATE
ALONG THE SIDELINES.
YOU SEE AS EVANS COMES OFF THE
BALL, HE RUNS STRAIGHT TO THE
SIDELINES.
STINGLEY'S GOT EYES ON THE BALL
AND, BOY, PLUS WITH BULLOCK
COMING OVER THE TOP THERE'S
NOWHERE FOR MAYFIELD TO FEEL
COMFORTABLE THROWING THAT
FOOTBALL TO GIVE THEM A CHANCE.
Joe:  38-YARD TRY BY
McLAUGHLIN.
FIRST ATTEMPT OF THE NIGHT AND
HITS THE UPRIGHT. IN HOUSTON
WITH A MINUTE ONE LEFT IN THE
THIRD QUARTER STILL 14-10 AFTER
THAT 38-YARD MISS BY CHASE
McLAUGHLIN WHO IS JUST SICK
ABOUT IT OVER ON THE SIDELINE.
HOUSTON STILL DOWN BY JUST FOUR
AS THEY HAND AND SHOVE ONE OF
HIS BETTER RUNS OF THE GAME
GETS SEVEN.
LEADING RUSHER FOR HOUSTON IS
C.J.
STROUD.
Troy:  THAT WAS CLOSE.
THAT WAS CLOSE BY NICK CHUBB.
THEY HAVEN'T HAD A WHOLE LOT TO
SHOW FOR THE RUN GAME, BUT IF
HE'S ABLE TO GET THROUGH THAT
INITIAL LINE AND IT WAS CLOSE,
HE'S GOT A CHANCE TO GET A BIG
PLAY, BUT THAT'S A GOOD WAY TO
START IT.
Joe:  SEVEN CARRIES, 18
YARDS.
CHUBB ABLE TO PICK UP THE
BLITZER FOR A MOMENT AND THE
PASS IS INCOMPLETE, THIRD AND
THREE COMING UP AND A FLAG IS
DOWN IN THE SECONDARY.
ROOKIE BENJAMIN MORRISON,
SECOND ROUND PICK FROM NOTRE
DAME.
Troy:  YEAH.
DEFINITELY CONTACT NICO
COLLINS.
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE THE ONE-
ON-ONE LOOK C.J.
STROUD WAS HOPING FOR AND HE
GETS AHOLD OF HIM THERE AND
AGAIN WHEN HE'S KIND OF TRYING
TO WORK BACK INTO IT.
YOU SEE THE FLAG COME OUT.
HE DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO PLAY
LAST WEEK WITH THE HAMSTRING,
BUT A GUY THEY'RE GOING TO
DEPEND ON AS THEY MOVE THROUGH
THIS SEASON.
Joe:  ON FIRST DOWN THIS ONE
IS CAUGHT BY THE TIGHT END.
SCHULTZ MAKES A NICE MOVE AND
GOT TEN, DEPENDS ON WHERE THEY
PUT IT DOWN.
THEY PUT IT RIGHT AT MIDFIELD
WHICH IS RIGHT AT FIRST DOWN
YARDAGE.
THAT WILL END THE QUARTER.
THEY'RE GOING TO MOVE IT BACK A
HALF YARD.
IT WILL BE SECOND DOWN AND LESS
THAN ONE WHEN WE START THE
FOURTH.
SO WE HAD THE MISSED FIELD GOAL
BY McLAUGHLIN.
NO SCORING SINCE EARLY IN
THE SECOND QUARTER, 14-10, JUST
HAD A MISSED FIELD GOAL TRY BY
McLAUGHLIN AND NOW IT IS SECOND
DOWN AND LESS THAN ONE AS WE
START THE FOURTH QUARTER WITH
THE BALL SITTING JUST SHY OF
MIDFIELD.
WE'LL SEE HOW NICK CALEY
WANTS TO PLAY THIS, SECOND AND
A FOOT, INCHES, WHATEVER IT IS,
MAYBE A LITTLE PLAY ACTION,
TAKE A SHOT.
Joe:  WELL, MAYBE YOU GET
YOUR WISH.
STROUD COMES BACK.
HE'S ABLE TO FIND THE ROOKIE
HIGGINS, NICE MOVE STILL
ROLLING AND HIGGINS INSIDE THE
25, HIS FIRST CATCH OF THE
GAME, HIS FIRST TARGET GOOD FOR
27 YARDS.
Troy:  THAT'S WHAT THEY DO.
THEY'RE ABLE TO MOVE THE POCKET
AND GIVE HIM A LITTLE TIME.
HE HAD THE OPTION TO PULL UP
AND MAYBE TAKE A DEEP SHOT
ACROSS THE FIELD TO NICO
COLLINS, BUT HE COMES TO
HIGGINS.
HERE'S THE DEEP SHOT ACROSS THE
FIELD THIS THEY HAD IT, BUT
THEY GET UNDERNEATH HIGGINS,
NICE GAIN.
Joe:  A CATCH OF 20 PLUS
YARDS AS CHUBB GETS HIT BY
TYKEE SMITH WHO HAS A SACK IN
THIS BALLGAME AND A LOSS ON THE
PLAY OF ONE.
Troy:  I WILL SAY JAYDEN
HIGGINS FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN --
AND IT'S A SMALL SAMPLE -- BUT
I LIKE HIM AND IF YOU LIKE NICO
COLLINS, YOU'LL PROBABLY LIKE
JAYDEN HIGGINS BECAUSE HE'S
BUILT A LOT LIKE HIM AND
WATCHING HIM AND THE OTHER
ROOKIE WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER
JAYLIN NOEL, BOTH OUT OF IOWA
STATE.
I THINK HE'S GOT A BRIGHT
FUTURE.
THIS IS GOING TO BE AN AWFULLY
GOOD GROUP WHEN EVERYBODY'S
GOING.
Joe:  SECOND AND 11 STROUD
CAN'T FIND ANYONE, NOW DOES AND
THAT ROUTE WAS UP FOR GRABS AS
JACOB PARRISH, THE ROOKIE FOR
TAMPA BAY, GOT UNDER THAT THROW
FOR COLLINS, INCOMPLETE.
Troy:  I DON'T KNOW IF C.J.
FELT HIM COMING UNDERNEATH IT
OR IT WAS JUST AN ERRANT THROW,
BUT THE FACT THIS BALL IS HIGH
WAS A BLESSING FOR STROUD.
OTHERWISE IT'S INTERCEPTED
BECAUSE WHEN HE LETS IT GO, YOU
SEE PARRISH COMES UNDERNEATH
IT.
IF THIS BALL IS NOT THROWN AS
HIGH AS IT IS, HE'S GOING TO
INTERCEPT THIS BALL.
SO HE MIGHT HAVE FELT IT AS
HE'S STARTING TO THROW OR IT
MIGHT HAVE JUST BEEN A THROW
THAT FORTUNATELY FOR HIM GOT
AWAY FROM HIM.
Joe:  THERE HAVE BEEN NO
TURNOVERS IN THIS GAME.
C.J.
STROUD HAS BEEN SACKED ON THE
LAST TWO THIRD DOWNS HE'S
FACED, THIRD AND 11, GETS IT
AWAY THIS TIME AND HAS A FIRST
DOWN WITH SCHULTZ INSIDE THE
TEN.
GOOD ROUTE BY DALTON SCHULTZ.
Troy:  HE'S MR. RELIABLE AND
AGAINST THAT ZONE COVERAGE HE
KNOWS EXACTLY WHERE HE NEEDS TO
GET, EVEN WITH A BALL THAT'S A
LITTLE BEHIND HIM.
HE'S ABLE TO MAKE A PLAY ON IT,
BUT THE BUCS ONLY RUSH FOUR AND
DON'T COME CLOSE TO GETTING
NEAR C.J.
STROUD.
Joe:  FIRST DOWN AND GOAL.
NICO'S IN THE SLOT.
ALL 6'4 OF HIM, STROUD TRYING
TO FIND HIM.
HE DOES, BUT COLLINS IS DOWN
SHORT OF THE END ZONE WITH
JAMEL DEAN RIGHT THERE AT
SECOND AND GOAL FROM INSIDE THE
ONE.
Troy:  THEY BRING AN ALL-OUT
BLITZ.
IF NICO COLLINS JUST TIGHTENS
THIS ANGLE TO WHERE HE'S NOT
GOING UP THE FIELD, IF HE GOES
FLATTER, HE CREATES MORE
SEPARATION AND HE PROBABLY
SCORES, BUT BECAUSE HE GOES UP
THE FIELD, IT CREATES A TOUGHER
ANGLE FOR C.J.
TO GET HIM THE FOOTBALL, NUMBER
ONE, AND ALSO THE DEFENDER'S
THERE TO MAKE A PLAY.
Joe:  SECOND AND GOAL.
HERE'S CHUBB BOTTLED UP AND
GETS NOWHERE.
VITA VEA GOT THROUGH AND MADE
THE TACKLE.
Troy:  YOU SAW CHUBB
HESITATE RIGHT AFTER HE GOT THE
BALL AND USUALLY WHEN YOU DO
THAT DOWN HERE, IT'S HARD TO
GET IT ACROSS THE GOAL LINE.
THERE'S A LITTLE PAUSE BECAUSE
OF THE PENETRATION AND THEN
FROM THERE IT'S HARD TO GET IT
GOING AGAIN FROM DOWN HERE THIS
CLOSE TO THE GOAL LINE.
Joe:  OGUNBOWALE COMES IN.
HE'S IN THE BACKFIELD NEXT TO
STROUD ON THIRD DOWN AND GOAL
FROM NOW OUTSIDE THE ONE.
PLAY CLOCK WAS AT ONE.
STROUD END ZONE, INCOMPLETE FOR
COLLINS.
AND THE OFFENSE WILL STAY OUT
THERE FOR DeMECO RYANS, FOURTH
AND GOAL.
Troy:  THEY HAD A CHANCE.
IT'S JUST SO TIGHT.
EVERYTHING HAS TO BE SO QUICK
AND PRECISE THAT THE DOUBLE
MOVE, HE GETS THE SEPARATION
AND IF STROUD DOESN'T LEAD HIM
QUITE SO MUCH UP THE FIELD,
IT'S A TOUCHDOWN, NOT SURPRISED
BY THE DECISION HERE AT ALL.
Joe:  THEY'VE HAD BACK-TO-
BACK TRIES FROM ABOUT THE ONE.
HERE'S ANOTHER, FOURTH AND
GOAL.
SP
SPRINTING LEFT, FLOATING IT,
INCOMPLETE, TAMPA BAY HOLDS.
McCOLLUM ON NICO COLLINS.
IT WAS FIRST AND GOAL FROM THE
8 AND THE TEXANS CAN'T GET IT
IN.
Troy:  THEY TRIED THROWING
IT ON THIRD AND FOURTH DOWN.
THIS ONE WAS NOT EVEN CLOSE.
THERE WAS NO CHANCE ON THIS
PLAY.
Joe:  THREE STRAIGHT STOPS
FROM THE ONE FOR NOT, BUT
THE REASON HE WEARS THE GLOVES
IS HE DOESN'T WANT TO HURT HIS
HANDS CATCHING THE BALL, HAS
NOTHING TO DO WITH THROWING THE
BALL.
Joe:  TAKING OVER AT THE 1,
SEE IF THEY CAN GET OUT OF
TROUBLE HERE, IRVING CARRIES
AND HE'S NOT ABLE TO GET TO THE
5, SECOND DOWN COMING UP, BUT
THEY GET A LITTLE BREATHING
ROOM AND WHAT WE JUST SAW WITH
REGARD TO HOUSTON, THEY GOT IT
DOWN THERE.
THEY HAD THREE CRACKS FROM THE
1. WHEN YOUR LEADING RUSHER IS
YOUR QUARTERBACK, THAT'S BAD
NEWS AND MAYBE ONE OF THE
REASONS WHY THEY WENT AWAY FROM
THE RUN THE FINAL TWO PLAYS.
Troy:  THEY LOSE YARDAGE AND
TRY TO LOW IT ON THIRD AND
FOURTH DOWN AND OBVIOUSLY DON'T
MAKE IT.
IF THIS TEAM IS GOING TO BE THE
CHAMPIONSHIP TEAM THEY WANT TO
BE, THEY'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO
RUN THE FOOTBALL IN THOSE
SITUATIONS.
THEY'VE GOT TO RUN IT WHEN
PEOPLE KNOW THEY ARE GOING TO
RUN IT AND THEY'VE GOT TO AT
LEAST TRY.
Joe:  SECOND DOWN AND SIX.
HERE'S HARRIS.
CHRISTIAN HARRIS MADE THAT PLAY
AS HE DROPS BUCKY IRVING, NO
GAIN AND A FLAG COMES IN ON THE
PLAY AND MAYFIELD IS
CELEBRATING.
LET'S SEE WHY.
THAT'S ON HARRIS WHO MADE THE
TACKLE.
HE GOT THE FACE MASK OF BUCKY
IRVING UP UNDER THE HELMET.
Troy:  HE SURE DID AND, MAN,
WHAT A COSTLY PENALTY THAT IS.
JOE, YOU MENTIONED IT EARLIER,
THE PENALTIES THEY HAD LAST
WEEK.
NOW MOST OF THOSE WERE
OFFENSIVELY, BUT THEY'VE GIVEN
UP A FEW FIRST DOWNS IN THIS
GAME DEFENSIVELY BECAUSE OF
PENALTIES.
THAT'S A BIG ONE.
THEY'RE BACKED UP AND NOW THEY
GET A NEW SET OF DOWNS AND THEN
THEY GET OFF THEIR OWN GOAL
LINE.
Joe:  THAT IS FIVE PENALTIES
TONIGHT ON HOUSTON.
UP UNDER THE HELMET COUNTS AS A
FACE MASK.
THAT WAS THE RIGHT CALL AND IT
GIVES TAMPA BAY SOME ROOM OUT
TO THEIR 19 AND NOW IRVING GETS
IT TO THE 20.
HERE'S THAT SEQUENCE AT THE
GOAL LINE BY TAMPA BAY.
THEY MAKE THE STOP, JAMEL DEAN
AND THE TACKLE, ON NICO
COLLINS.
THERE'S THE RUN BY CHUBB AND
THEN TWO STRAIGHT THROWS.
Troy:  TWO STRAIGHT THROWS.
THEY HAD A CHANCE THERE.
THAT'S ONE I KNOW STROUD WOULD
LIKE TO HAVE BACK.
THIS ONE THERE WAS JUST NOTHING
THERE WHATSOEVER.
IT'S EASY TO GO BACK AFTER THE
FACT.
IF THEY HIT ONE OF THOSE,
NOBODY'S COMMENTING ON IT.
IT'S A TOUCHDOWN, BUT THEY'VE
HAD A HARD TIME RUNNING THE
FOOTBALL AND TO HAVE TO RELY ON
C.J.
STROUD WHEN YOU GET DOWN THERE,
PRETTY HARD TO DO.
Joe:  OFF THE HANDS ON THAT
SECOND DOWN TRY OTTON, COULDN'T
MAKE THE GRAB, WASN'T ANYTHING
THERE ANYWAY AND IT'S THIRD
DOWN AND TEN AS THE TEXANS TRY
TO GET THE BALL RIGHT BACK.
Troy:  IT'S BEEN A CLEAN
GAME FOR BOTH OFFENSES IN TERMS
OF NOT TURNING THE BALL OVER
AND WHICH DEFENSE IS GOING TO
MAKE THE GAME CHANGING PLAY TO
REALLY SEAL VICTORY?
IT JUST FEELS LIKE FOR HOUSTON
THIS DEFENSE HAS DONE A LOT OF
REALLY GOOD THINGS TONIGHT.
CAN THEY MAKE THE ONE BIG PLAY
THAT THEY NEED RIGHT NOW?
Joe:  BLITZ COMING OFF THE
EDGE WITH PITRE.
MAYFIELD GOES BY PITRE AND GET
THE FIRST DOWN, BROUGHT DOWN
FROM BEHIND AND MAYFIELD'S
HURT.
AND THEN GETS IN THE FACE OF
C.J.
GARDNER-JOHNSON, BUT A 17-YARD
CARRY BY BAKER MAYFIELD ON
THIRD DOWN AND TEN.
Troy:  YOU SEE EVERYBODY
TURN AND RUN AND BAKER MAYFIELD
THEN SEES IT OPEN UP AND
DEFENDERS HAVE THEIR BACKS TO
HIM AND OFF HE GOES.
I MEAN THIS GUY IS NOT THAT
FAST, BUT YET HE MAKES PLAYS
WITH HIS LEGS.
HE'S NOT OVERLY ATHLETIC, BY
ANY MEANS, BUT YET HE KNOWS HOW
TO PLAY THE GAME AND CAN DO
JUST ENOUGH IN MOMENTS LIKE
THAT.
Joe:  BANGED HIS KNEE INTO
THE TURF AND THEN POPPED RIGHT
UP AFTER INITIALLY LOOKING LIKE
HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN INJURED,
WHAT A PLAY.
FLAG IS DOWN AS THE CATCH IS
MADE OUT ON THE EDGE BY IRVING
AND TO'OTO'O WAS THERE FOR
HOUSTON TO BRING HIM DOWN.
FLAG IN THE SECONDARY, HOWEVER.
PENALTY NUMBER SIX AGAINST THE
TEXANS AND THESE ARE TWO
IMPORTANT ONES HERE LATE.
Troy:  THAT'S ON KAMARI
LASSITER.
HE'S RIDING HIM UP THE FIELD.
HE'S GOT AHOLD OF HIM ON RYAN
MILLER.
Joe:  11 PENALTIES IN WEEK
ONE, SEVEN ON THE OFFENSE.
SIX PENALTIES IN WEEK TWO, FIVE
ON THE DEFENSE FOR DeMECO
RYANS.
THEY'RE GOING TO THROW THE FLAG
AND FIVE YARDS.
SO NOW FIRST DOWN AND 15 WITH
JUST OVER EIGHT TO PLAY HERE IN
HOUSTON.
BUCCANEERS BALL, UP FOUR.
HANDOFF TO IRVING, CUTS BACK,
STILL ROLLING AND THE TEXANS
SWARM TO THE BALL.
IN THE END IT'S A FIVE-YARD
CARRY.
LASSITER GETS THE STOP.
Troy:  YOU CALLED IT, JOE.
THERE ARE WHITE JERSEYS FLYING
ALL OVER THIS FIELD AND NOW
TAMPA BAY, THEY'RE PICKING UP
THE TEMPO.
Joe:  SECOND AND TEN.
Troy:  THIS HAS ALREADY BEEN
A SUCCESSFUL DRIVE FOR TAMPA,
JUST GETTING FIELD POSITION
BACK.
Joe:  QUICK THROW SHEPARD
DELIVERS A SHOULDER INTO C.J.
GARDNER-JOHNSON.
THAT WILL MAKE IT THIRD DOWN
AND SHORT AFTER A GAIN OF ABOUT
SEVEN.
THE BATTLE BETWEEN DeMECO
RYANS AND JOSH GRIZZARD, THIRD
DOWN AND THREE.
FOUR-MAN RUSH, MAYFIELD HAS THE
BALL KNOCKED OUT.
RACHAAD WHITE WAS THERE FOR
TAMPA BAY AND GOT BACK ON THE
BALL.
DANIELLE HUNTER IS THE ONE WHO
KNOCKED IT OUT AND WHITE WHO
RECOVERED THE FUMBLE IS NOT
ABLE TO GET UP.
A LOSS OF FOUR.
IT BRINGS UP FOURTH DOWN AND
THEN THE QUESTION IS HOW HURT
IS RACHAAD WHITE?
Troy:  THE ANGLE HE HAD TO
GO TRY AND GET ON THIS
FOOTBALL, I DIDN'T THINK HE WAS
GOING TO BEAT THE DEFENDER FOR
HOUSTON TO THE BALL, BUT THAT
WAS THE OPPORTUNITY THAT
HOUSTON WAS LOOKING FOR WITH
THE BALL ON THE GROUND.
HE TAKES A HELMET RIGHT TO THE
RIBS.
I THINK PITRE IS THE ONE WITH
WHO DRILLS HIM.
Joe:  THAT BALL JUST CAME
OUT OF THE HANDS OF BAKER
MAYFIEF FIT,
STYLE AND COMFORT.
BAKER MAYFIELD IS OVER ON
THE
BAKER MAYFIELD IS OVER ON
THE BENCH, KIND OF FORCED HIS
OWN FUMBLE WHEN HIS LEFT HAND
KNOCKED IT OUT OF HIS RIGHT.
RACHAAD WHITE WAS ABLE TO GET
ON TOP OF IT, THEN GET UP AND
WALK TO THE SIDELINE ON HIS OWN
POWER AND NOW ON FOURTH DOWN
AND SIX, A PUNT COMING FROM
RILEY DIXON WITH THE ROOKIE
JAYLIN NOEL WAITING FOR IT FOR
HOUSTON.
AND IT'S BLOCKED.
TEXANS' BALL INSIDE THE 40.
AND ABLE TO CELEBRATE IS FRANK
ROSS, THE SPECIAL TEAMS
COORDINATOR, AS OGUNBOWALE AND
JAKOB JOHNSON GOT THROUGH, BUT
THERE WERE PLENTY THERE FOR
HOUSTON TO BLOCK THAT PUNT BY
RILEY DIXON.
Troy:  RILEY DIXON, HERE
THEY'RE COMING.
YOU SEE IT AND HE WAS PRETTY
METHODICAL.
IT JUST SEEMED LIKE HE WAS
PRETTY CASUAL AS FAR AS HOW HE
WAS GOING TO PUNT THE FOOTBALL
AS IF THERE WAS NO RUSH
WHATSOEVER.
AS SOON AS HE GOT THE BALL, I
BETTER SPEED THAT UP A LITTLE
BIT.
THEY GOT CLOSE BEFORE AND THIS
WAS THE BREAK THAT THE TEXANS
NEEDED.
Joe:  JAKOB JOHNSON, FORMER
NEW ENGLAND PATRIOT, GOT
THROUGH AND GOT THE BLOCKED
PUNT.
RAVENS HAD A BLOCKED PUNT IN
THEIR GAME YESTERDAY.
THAT'S THE SECOND OF THE YOUNG
SEASON ACROSS THE NFL.
STROUD THROWS AND IT'S BEHIND
HIS TARGET, HUTCHINSON.
Troy:  WELL, STROUD, THIS IS
HIS SECOND READ IN THE
PROGRESSION AND YOU'RE GOING TO
SEE AS HUTCHINSON COMES ACROSS
HERE, THE SPEED IN WHICH HE
HITS THIS HOLE AND HE'S THROUGH
THE WINDOW AND IT JUST THROWS A
QUARTERBACK OFF.
SO IF HE THROTTLES IT DOWN A
LITTLE BIT OR IF STROUD GETS TO
IT SOONER, BUT IT'S AN ERRANT
THROW, BUT I CAN TELL YOU THE
COLOR THAT'S OUT IN FRONT OF
HIM BY TAMPA, IT SCARES A
QUARTERBACK.
HE DIDN'T WANT TO LEAD HIM.
Joe:  JOHNSON IN MOTION ON
SECOND AND TEN AND THEY JUST
CAN'T RUN IT.
THE CROWD HAS SEEN ENOUGH AND
IT'S THIRD DOWN AND LONG, UNDER
SIX TO GO.
Troy:  WE'LL SEE WHAT TODD
BOWLES -- HE'S BEEN AWFULLY
AGGRESSIVE.
HE'S BEEN DIALING IT UP AS OF
LATE.
WHAT WILL HE DO ON THIRD DOWN?
Joe:  TEXANS UNDER 3 1/2
YARDS PER RUSH.
IT'S A BIG STORY IN THIS GAME.
IT'S THIRD DOWN AND TEN.
BACK PEDALING STROUD ALMOST
THROWS A PICK TO LAVONTE DAVID,
BUT IT'S FOURTH DOWN.
THAT WAS A GIFT THAT DAVID
RETURNED AND IT'S FOURTH AND
TEN.
Troy:  TRUE TO FORM, TODD
BOWLES BRINGS A ZERO BLITZ.
THERE'S NO MIDDLE SAFETY.
HERE THEY ALL COME LOCKED UP
AND SOMEBODY HAS GOT TO WIN
RIGHT AWAY AND GIVE STROUD A
PLACE TO GO WITH THE FOOTBALL.
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
AND YOU CAN'T TAKE A SACK.
AT LEAST NOW THEY HAVE AN
OPPORTUNITY TO TRY TO COME AWAY
WITH SOME POINTS.
Joe:  HOW ABOUT THREE PLAYS
AND NO YARDS FOR THE TEXANS
AFTER THAT BLOCKED PUNT AND NOW
THE FIELD GOAL TRY FROM
FAIRBAIRN FROM 53 AND HE'S
TABLE TO BEND IT IN AND WE'VE
GOT  I DON'T
HAVE HAIR.
WELL, THE DEFENSE IS FLYING
AROUND, MUCH TO THE CHAGRIN OF
C.J. STROUD. THEY GOT NO
YARDAGE AFTER THAT BLOCKED
THE DEFENSE IS FLYING
AROUND.
THEY GOT NO YARDAGE AFTER THAT
BLOCKED PUNT.
THEY DO GET THE FIELD GOAL.
FAIRBAIRN MADE 13 FROM THAT
RANGE A YEAR AGO AND WE'VE GOT
A ONE-POINT GAME IN TEXAS.
THAT WILL LAND IN THE END ZONE
AND THAT MEANS IT'S OUT TO THE
35.
WE'LL GIVE YOU TONIGHT'S GAME
RECAP BROUGHT TO YOU BY
GILLETTE AS BAKER MAYFIELD GOES
BACK TO WORK.
SCORING CAME EARLY.
EMEKA EGBUKA MADE IT 14-10 ON
THIS CATCH AND RUN IN THE
SECOND QUARTER.
IT STAYED THAT WAY SEEMINGLY
FOREVER.
THEN THE McLAUGHLIN MISS, THE
STOP BY THE BUCCANEERS ON
SECOND, THIRD, AND FOURTH AND
GOAL FROM THE 1. THE BLOCKED
PUNT A MOMENT AGO BY JAKOB
JOHNSON THAT LED TO NO YARDS
BUT THREE POINTS UP THE RIGHT
FOOT AS FAIRBAIRN JUST SNEAKS
IT IN TO MAKE IT 14-13.
FROM THE 35 TOSS TO IRVING
RUNNING LEFT, GOOD PLAY BY
HOUSTON'S DEFENSE, LASSITER OUT
THERE TO MAKE THE STOP, NO
GAIN.
Troy:  THIS HAS BEEN AN
ABSOLUTE DEFENSIVE BATTLE
WATCHING BOTH THESE TEAMS.
WHAT A JOB TAMPA DID ON THAT
LAST SERIES, NOT GIVING UP ANY
YARDS, BRINGING PRESSURE AND
NOT GIVING UP ANY MORE THAN
THREE POINTS AFTER THE BLOCKED
PUNT, PRETTY IMPRESSIVE.
NOW YOU WATCH TAMPA
OFFENSIVELY, THEY'VE GOT MORE
YARDS RUSHING THAN THEY DO
PASSING.
THERE'S NOTHING THEY'D LOVE
MORE THAN JUST TO GIVE THE BALL
TO BUCKY IRVING LIKE THEY TRIED
TO DO ON FIRST DOWN AND WIND
THIS CLOCK
DOWN, BUT HOUSTON WON'T ALLOW
THAT.
Joe:  BOTH IRVING AND WHITE
IN THE GAME, BROKE ONE TACKLE,
CAN'T BREAK THAT TACKLE BY C.J.
GARDNER-JOHNSON AND A GAIN OF
TWO WITH THIRD AND LONG.
Troy:  YOU GO BACK AND SEE
WHO WON THE THIRD DOWN.
THAT'S A BIG STAT IN
DETERMINING WHO ULTIMATELY IS
THE WINNER AND TAMPA HAS BEEN
ABLE TO DOMINATE WHERE THE
TEXANS HAVE HAD A HARD TIME
JUST LIKE LAST WEEK.
TAMPA NOW 50%.
THIS IS A BIG DOWN FOR BOTH
THESE TEAMS, BUT HOUSTON HAS
GOT TO MAKE A STOP.
Joe:  THIRD AND EIGHT,
MAYFIELD.
ANDERSON GOT THERE.
A LOT OF EIGHT AND IT'S FOURTH
DOWN.
Troy:  IT'S WHAT YOU'RE ABLE
TO DO.
THEY SHOW A LOOK LIKE THEY
MIGHT BRING IT.
THEY PULL OUT THE LINEBACKERS.
THEY ONLY RUSH FOUR.
HERE COMES WILL ANDERSON.
THEY TRY TO CHIP WITH OTTON AND
HE JUST KEEPS PLAYING BECAUSE
DANIELLE HUNTER, HIS RUSHING
MATE OPPOSITE HIM FORCES
MAYFIELD INTO THE POCKET.
IT LOOKED LIKE THEY WERE HOPING
TO TRY TO TAKE A SHOT DOWN THE
FIELD ON THE ONE-ON-ONE LOOK,
BUT THEY DIDN'T GET IT.
Joe:  THIS TIME DIXON GETS
RID OF IT MUCH FASTER, FOUR
SACKS TONIGHT FOR THE HOUSTON
DEFENSE IT.
HERE'S A NICE RETURN BY NOEL,
THE ROOKIE, STILL ROLLING, FLAG
ON THE PLAY AND NOEL IS OUT OF
BOUNDS INSIDE THE 30, BUT
THERE'S A FLAG BACK AT THE
HOUSTON 30-YARD LINE.
EVERYBODY IS MOVING BACK THE
OTHER WAY AS FRANK ROSS WANTS
TO KNOW WHO IT'S ON.
SO THEY PICK IT UP AND
EVERYBODY HAS TO MOVE DOWN TO
THE OTHER END.
THE FLAG CAME OUT LATE AND
MAYBE WITH TREMON SMITH WITH
THAT BLOCK IT LOOKED LIKE IT
WAS CLOSE TO BEING IN THE BACK,
BUT AFTER THE FLAG CAME OUT
THEY PICK IT UP AND DeMECO
RYANS KNOWS HIS TEAM IS SET UP
AT THE 26 OF TAMPA BAY AND
THEY'RE INSIDE FIELD GOAL RANGE
ALREADY.
Troy:  YEAH, HERE THEY GO.
YOU GOT AN OFFENSE THAT'S
STRUGGLING.
YOU HEAR COACH SPEAK EACH AND
EVERY WEEK AFTER THESE GAMES
IT'S ALL THREE PHASES.
TONIGHT IT'S AT LEAST BEEN TWO
EVERY THEM FOR THE HOUSTON
TEXANS WITH THE DEFENSE AND NOW
THE SPECIAL TEAMS AFTER THE
BLOCKED PUNT, THE RETURN NOW BY
NOEL.
THEY'RE TRYING TO CARRY THIS
OFFENSE INTO THE END ZONE IF
THEY CAN FOR A WIN.
Joe:  53-YARD RETURN BY THE
ROOKIE NOEL WHO WAS ALL BIG 12
SPECIAL TEAMER LAST YEAR AND
THE ROOKIE HAS SET THEM UP.
VITA VEA MAKES THAT STOP ON
NICK CHUBB AND A GAIN OF JUST
ONE AS WE ARE COMING UP ON 2
1/2 MINUTES LEFT, EACH SIDE
WITH THREE TIME-OUTS.
Troy:  WHEN JAYLIN NOEL GOT
IN THE OPEN SPACE, THIS GUY'S
GOT SOME BURNERS AND HE CAN
SCOOT.
SO I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, DIXON
SLOWED HIM DOWN A LITTLE BIT,
BUT I THOUGHT HE WAS GONE.
Joe:  HOUSTON RUNNING BACKS
IN THIS GAME, 14 CARRIES, 32
YARDS.
THAT'S IT.
CHUBB'S GOT 18.
ADD TO IT NICK CHUBB, TOUCHDOWN
TEXANS.
THEY'RE ON TOP.
THE TEXANS WILL GO FOR TWO
AFTER A
THE TEXANS WILL GO FOR TWO
AFTER A 25-YARD CARRY BY NICK
CHUBB.
Troy:  YOU SEE THE PUSH
INSIDE.
TYTUS HOWARD MAKES A KEY BLOCK
ON THE INSIDE.
McCOLLUM TAKES A BAD ANGLE, AS
DOES WINFIELD.
EVERYBODY'S UP AT THE LINE AND
ONCE HE GETS PAST, TOUCHDOWN
HOUSTON.
Joe:  IF THEY CONVERT, IT'S
A SEVEN-POINT GAME.
JUST 0 FOR 2 LAST YEAR ON TWO-
POINT TRIES.
DID NOT TRY ONE WEEK ONE.
STROUD IN TROUBLE AND DOWN HE
GOES, PLAY'S MADE BY DEION
JONES AND THIS IS A FIVE-POINT
GAME.
Troy:  OGUNBOWALE, HE'S IN
THE BACKFIELD.
YOU GOT TO SECURE FIRST.
YOU SEE JONES HAS A STRAIGHT
SHOT.
TRYING TO SORT THROUGH THAT AND
HERE HE COMES AND HAASON
REDDICK OFF THE OTHER SIDE AND
HERE'S A LOOK AT THE TOUCHDOWN
BY NICK CHUBB.
Joe:  MORE YARDS ON THAT
CARRY, 25 YARDS, THAN HE HAD
ALL NIGHT, HAD 18 BEFORE THAT
AND STROUD KNEW IT RIGHT AWAY
ONCE HE GOT PAST THE LINE OF
SCRIMMAGE AND THAT FOR THE
TEXANS, THEIR FIFTH PLAY OF 25
PLUS YARDS IN THIS GAME.
I'LL SAY THIS FOR NICK CALEY,
FIRST YEAR OFFENSIVE
COORDINATOR, IT HAS BEEN UGLY
TRYING TO RUN THE BALL TONIGHT,
BUT HE STAYED WITH IT AND HE
GETS A 25-YARD TOUCHDOWN CARRY
BY NICK CHUBB, HIS FIRST SINCE
WEEK 12 LAST YEAR WITH
CLEVELAND.
Troy:  TAMPA'S HAD THEIR
OPPORTUNITIES AND IN SOME WAYS
THEY'VE KIND OF BEEN TRYING TO
HAND IT TO THE TEXANS AND THE
TEXANS HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT.
YOU JUST KEEP KNOCKING AT THE
DOOR.
EVENTUALLY SOMETHING WILL GIVE
AND IT FINALLY DID WITH NICK
CHUBB.
WE SAW WHAT BAKER MAYFIELD DID
LAST WEEK.
HE'S GOING TO GET ANOTHER
OPPORTUNITY TONIGHT.
Joe:  HERE'S JOHNSON TO THE
30 AND A FLAG ON THAT PLAY WITH
2:04 REMAINING IN THE GAME,
THREE TIME-OUTS.
NIGHT COUNTDOWN AT
6:00 EASTERN.
JARED GOFF 334, FIVE TOUCHDOWN
PASSES, FIVE INCOMPLETIONS
YESTERDAY IN THAT BIG WIN OVER
THE BEARS, AND LAMAR JACKSON,
FOUR TOUCHDOWN PASSES, NO
PICKS.
Troy:  AFTER THE OFFENSES'
SHOWINGS LAST WEEK, THESE
DEFENSIVE COORDINATORS AREN'T
GOING TO GET MUCH SLEEP THIS
WEEK.
Joe:  A LOT OF ROOM FOR
IRVING, TEN PLUS, AND WE'RE  ON ABC.
WE WELCOME YOU BACK.
WE WELCOME YOU BACK.
REMEMBER THAT OFFICIATING CREW
ON THAT 53-YARD RETURN BY NOEL
PICKED UP THE FLAG.
WE'RE THINKING IT COULD EITHER
BE THIS OR OGUNBOWALE WITH A
GRAB ON RYAN MILLER.
DID YOU SEE ANYTHING, RUSSELL?
NO, I DIDN'T.
THE FIRST ONE YOU SEE A HAND ON
THE BACK AND SHOULDER.
I DIDN'T SEE EXTENSION PUSHING
FROM THE BLACK.
I GLAD THEY DIDN'T CALL THAT
FOR A BLOCK IN THE BACK, AND
THEN YOU SAW THE BEGINNINGS OF
A POTENTIAL HOLD.
I'M GLAD HE PICKED UP THE PLAY.
Joe:  SO ARE THE TEXANS.
Troy:  I DON'T KNOW WHERE MY
EMOTION IS ON THAT, BUT I HAVE
SEEN A LOT LESS CALLED.
Joe:  FIRST DOWN FOR TAMPA
BAY, DOWN BY FIVE.
HAS TO COME UNDERNEATH, PASS IS
CAUGHT AND SHORT GAIN.
REMEMBER, IT'S WORTH SAYING
AGAIN, AS YOU LOOK AT MAYFIELD
SINCE HE BECAME A BUCCANEER,
HE'S GOT 22 TOUCHDOWN PASSES IN
THE FOURTH QUARTER OR OVERTIME,
MOST IN THE LEAGUE.
BUCCANEERS ARE WITHOUT THEIR
TWO STARTING TACKLES.
MAYFIELD AIRS IT OUT FOR EVANS,
INCOMPLETE WITH STINGLEY OUT
THERE IN COVERAGE AND THOSE TWO
HAVE BATTLED ALL NIGHT LONG.
STINGLEY HAS HAD THE UPPER
HAND.
Troy:  GOOD COVERAGE ALL
NIGHT BY HIM.
THAT'S BEEN ONE GREAT BATTLE.
SOME OF THAT MAN COVERAGE AND
THINGS THAT THEY'RE DOING, YOU
CAN FIND AN IN-BREAKING ROUTE
WHERE YOU'VE GOT A LITTLE MORE
ROOM TO THROW THE FOOTBALL,
BEEN PRETTY TIGHT TRYING TO GET
THE BALL TO EVANS ALONG THE
BOUNDARY.
Joe:  HE'S BEEN TARGETED TEN
TIMES, HAS FOUR CATCHES, THIRD
AND TEN.
MAY NEED OUT TO HIS RIGHT
LOOKING FOR HELP, GOING TO AIR
IT OUT TO HIS RIGHT AND EGBUKA
WHO CAN'T MAKE THE CATCH.
FOURTH DOWN.
Troy:  THAT WAS SUCH A GREAT
JOB BY MAYFIELD AS HE GETS
OUTSIDE THE POCKET AND THEN
FINDING EGBUKA DOWN THE FIELD,
I MEAN THIS BALL WHILE HE'S ON
THE RUN IS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT.
Joe:  IT'S WORTH TALKING
ABOUT, TROY, AS YOU LOOK AT
THIS THROW, A MISSED CHANCE FOR
EGBUKA.
TAMPA BAY HAS THREE TIME-OUTS
LEFT, BUT THEY'RE CHOOSING TO
GO FOR IT ON FOURTH AND TEN,
PRESSURE OFF THE EDGE.
MAYFIELD STEPS THROUGH AND HE'S
TRIPPED UP WITH A FIRST DOWN BY
GARDNER-JOHNSON.
TO'OTO'O COULDN'T BRING HIM
DOWN AND BAKER MAYFIELD GETS
THE BIG FIRST DOWN.
Troy:  YEAH.
I THINK HE'S HOBBLED AS IT IS,
SO HE'S NOT MOVING AS WELL AS
HE TYPICALLY CAN.
IT OPENS UP.
HE TAKES IT AND JUST DOES WHAT
HE DOES.
Joe:  15 YARDS ON FOURTH AND
TEN, THE BUCCANEERS ALIVE,
CATCH MADE BY THE TIGHT END
OTTON AND HE'S OUT OF BOUNDS
WITH 52 SECONDS LEFT AND THREE
TIME-OUTS ON THE BOARD FOR THE
BUCCANEERS DOWN FIVE.
Troy:  PRETTY GOOD.
YOU'LL SEE HERE AS BAKER IS
LOOKING AND THE PRESSURE, HERE
THEY COME AND HE JUST ESCAPES
AND EVERYONE RUNNING IN MAN
COVERAGE WITH THEIR BACKS TO
MAYFIELD.
THEY DON'T KNOW THAT HE'S GOT
THE FOOTBALL.
Joe:  SECOND DOWN, THE BALL
AT THE 45 OF HOUSTON.
Troy:  WILL ANDERSON AND
DANIELLE HUNTER ARE NOT ON THE
FIELD.
Joe:  A TIME-OUT I THINK
WISELY TAKEN BY HOUSTON BECAUSE
OF THAT.
I THINK THOSE GUYS ARE OUT OF
BREATH.
THEY'VE BEEN CHASING BAKER
MAYFIELD THIS ENTIRE SECOND
HALF COMING AFTER THESE TWO
TACKLES AND HOUSTON HAS TO WEST AGAINST THE
CHARGERS, BOTH TEAMS 1-0.
Troy:  TODD BOWLES SAYING
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE A
STOP.
WE CAN GIVE UP THREE POINTS AND
IT'S STILL A ONE-POSSESSION
GAME.
WHY NOT GO FOR IT HERE?
IT PAID OFF.
Joe:  SECOND DOWN AND TWO,
IRVING.
AL-SHAAIR CANNOT MAKE THE STOP.
IRVING STILL ROLLING DOWN
INSIDE THE 25.
TIME-OUT TAMPA BAY.
THAT'S JUST THEIR FIRST WITH 42
SECONDS LEFT, BUT THEY HAVE TO
GET IT INTO THE END ZONE.
Troy:  HOW GOOD IS BUCKY
IRVING?
HEKNOWINGAZEEZ AL-SHAAIR IS IN
COVERAGE AND HE PUTS HIS FOOT
IN THE GROUND GOING NORTH AND
SOUTH AND WHAT AN IMPACT HE HAS
MADE ON THIS FOOTBALL TEAM
SINCE HE WAS DRAFTED IN THE
FOURTH ROUND.
Joe:  DEREK BARNETT GOT A
HAND INSIDE NOT JUST THE
SHOULDER PADS, BUT THE NECKLACE
OF BAKER MAYFIELD, BROKE IT.
THAT'S NOT A FOUL BECAUSE HE
WAS STILL IN THE POCKET, SO YOU
CAN'T HAVE A HORSE COLLAR.
Joe:  FIRST DOWN FROM THE
23.
Troy:  THEY GOT HUNTER AND
ANDERSON BOTH ON THE FIELD.
Joe:  MAYFIELD PROTECTED,
IRVING OUT OF THE BACKFIELD ONE
ON ONE AND HE LOWERS HIS
SHOULDER AND TRIES TO GO RIGHT
THROUGH TO'OTO'O AND GOT FIVE
AND STOPS THE CLOCK WITH 34
SECONDS LEFT.
Troy:  ALL THE TIME IN THE
WORLD FOR TAMPA BAY WITH TWO
TIME-OUTS REMAINING.
Joe:  BUCCANEERS TRYING TO
GET TO 2-0 THE FIFTH STRAIGHT
YEAR OF THEY'VE GOT 18 YARDS TO
GO.
PASS CAUGHT, EVANS DOWN TO THE
SEVEN AND IT WILL BE FIRST DOWN
AND GOAL FROM THE SEVEN-YARD
LINE AND THE CLOCK CONTINUES TO
RUN WITH TWO TIME-OUTS.
Troy:  THEY'RE TRYING TO
DISGUISE A BLITZ, NOT ABLE TO
GET HOME, BUT IT OPENED UP A
LOT OF ROOM.
Joe:  CLOCK RUNNING, OTTON
OUT OF BOUNDS HIT BY GARDNER-
JOHNSON AT THE 2 AND IT'S
SECOND AND GOAL WITH NINE
SECONDS LEFT.
Troy:  NINE SECONDS LEFT AND
BECAUSE OF THE TWO TIME-OUTS,
THEY DON'T HAVE TO THROW THE
FOOTBALL.
IN ESSENCE, TOUCHDOWN WINS IT.
Joe:  SECOND AND GOAL, BALL
JUST OUTSIDE THE 2. RACHAAD
WHITE IN THE GAME.
Troy:  WELL, LOOK FOR HIM.
HE'S THE RED ZONE THREAT FOR
TAMPA BAY.
Joe:  AND NOW TIME-OUT IS
TAKEN BY HOUSTON.
NINE SECONDS TO GO, TWO TIME-
OUTS AND THE PLAYBOOK IS WIDE
OPEN FOR FIRST TIME OFFENSIVE
COORDINATOR JOSH GRIZZARD WHO
WAS IN CHARGE OF THEIR THIRD
DOWN PLAYS A YEAR AGO, CUT HIS
TEETH WITH THE MIAMI DOLPHINS.
LAST YEAR HE WAS WORKING FOR
LIAM COHEN AND NOW IT'S ALL ON
HIM.
Troy:  I'M NOT SO SURE I
WOULDN'T RUN IT HERE TWICE.
HOUSTON DID NOT DO IT WHEN THEY
WERE DOWN HERE AND COULDN'T GET
IT IN.
WE'LL SEE WHAT TAMPA BAY HAS IN
MIND.
Joe:  OTTON IN MOTION.
THEY ARE GOING TO RUN IT AND NO
SIGNAL YET.
TOUCHDOWN TAMPA BAY, RACHAAD
WHITE ON TOP WITH SIX SECONDS
TO GO.
HE'S BEEN DOING IT ALL NIGHT,
CONTACT BEFORE THE LINE, AND HE
JUST KEEPS MOVING THE PILE.
WE'VE SEEN IT.
WE SAW IT ALL LAST YEAR.
I TOLD YOU HE GETS STRONGER AS
THE GAME GOES ALONG AND WITH
THE GAME ON THE LINE AND THEM
NEEDING THE PLAY, HE JUST
CARRIES THEM RIGHT INTO THE END
ZONE.
AL-SHAAIR COULDN'T STOP HIM AND
NOW GOING FOR TWO ARE THE
BUCCANEERS.
THERE'S ONLY SIX SECONDS LEFT
IN THE BALLGAME AND TAMPA BAY
WILL USE A TIME-OUT AS THE
TEXANS ARE STARING AT AN 0-2
START AND I'VE BEEN SAYING IT
ALL NIGHT.
TAMPA BAY BUCCANEERS ARE SIX
SECONDS AWAY FROM STARTING THIS
SEASON 2-0, AS THEY'VE DONE THE
PREVIOUS FOUR YEARS.
Troy:  WELL, I THINK RIGHT
HERE, JOE, TAMPA'S GOT TO BE
SMART OR MAYFIELD HAS TO BE
SMART, EVERYBODY NEEDS TO BE,
WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO TRY TO DO
HERE.
YOU GET A LITTLE RECKLESS ON
THIS TWO-POINT PLAY AND GIVE
THE DEFENSE AN OPPORTUNITY TO
RETURN IT.
THEY DON'T NECESSARILY NEED THE
POINTS.
Joe:  THEIR FIRST TWO-POINT
TRY OF THE YEAR.
MAYFIELD IS JUST GOING TO GET
RID OF IT OUT OF THE BACK OF
THE END ZONE AND MAYFIELD TOOK
A LOT OF HITS HERE TONIGHT AND
A LOT OF LOWE HITS FROM THIS
HOUSTON DEFENSE, NOT SAYING IT
WAS DIRTY, BUT HE'S BEEN
THROUGH A LOT IN WEEK TWO.
Troy:  NO DOUBT AND EVEN ON
THAT LAST PLAY, JOE, HE GOT HIT
HARD.
IT'S GOING TO BE INTERESTING TO
SEE HOW HE COMES OUT OF THIS
GAME FOR NEXT WEEK BECAUSE HE
HAS BEEN A BATTLER AND IT'S
WHAT YOU COME TO EXPECT FROM
HIM.
THEY DID IT LAST WEEK.
THEY NEEDED TO MAKE PLAYS.
MAYFIELD MAKES IT ON FOURTH
DOWN.
HERE'S THE LAST HIT THAT WE --
HE'S PRETTY BEAT UP TONIGHT.
A LOT OF GUYS ARE.
THIS WAS A PHYSICAL GAME BOTH
SIDES OF THE BALL.
Joe:  SO SIX SECONDS REMAIN.
THE TEXANS DO HAVE A TIME-OUT.
COMPARE THE TWO QUARTERBACKS
AND THE NUMBERS DON'T BLOW YOU
AWAY.
THE DIFFERENCE TONIGHT, THE RUN
GAME FOR THE TAMPA BAY
BUCCANEERS ALBEIT WITH THAT 25-
YARD CARRY BY NICK CHUBB FOR
HOUSTON.
THAT WAS THE ONLY BRIGHT SPOT
ALL NIGHT IN THE GROUND GAME
FOR THE TEXANS.
Troy:  YEAH.
THAT WAS THEIR DEMISE.
EVERYTHING WAS ON C.J.
STROUD, JUST REALLY COULDN'T
GET ANYTHING GOING.
THEY'RE STILL TRYING TO FIND
THEIR FOOTING UNDER THE FIRST
TIME OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR NICK
CALEY.
Joe:  HERE IS A RETURN BY
TREMON SMITH AND THAT'S IT.
THE CLOCK EXPIRES AS SMITH
TWO YEARS THEY'VE STARTED ZERO
TWO. DON'T FORGET. COMING UP
NEXT ON ABC, CATCH A SPECIAL
REPLAY OF THE VERY FIRST
EPISODE OF HIGH POTENTIAL AND
