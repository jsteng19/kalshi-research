the
[ct=1.764] FOOTBALL.
[ct=3.011] GLAD TO HAVE YOU WITH US ON ABC
[ct=3.011] AND ESPN.
[ct=12.307] JOHN HARBAUGH ON THE RIGHT.
[ct=14.455] SEASON NUMBER 18.
[ct=16.909] WITH THE BALTIMORE RAVENS AND
[ct=19.281] DAN CAMPBELL, SEASON NUMBER
[ct=19.655] FIVE.
[ct=21.721] TWO GUYS THAT GUIDED THEIR TEAMS
[ct=23.218] INTO THE POSTSEASON.
[ct=25.300] TWO DIVISION WINNERS A YEAR AGO,
[ct=25.927] LAMAR JACKSON GETTING SET TO
[ct=26.540] ROLL.
[ct=27.377] HE’LL WATCH HIS DEFENSE START
[ct=27.731] THE NIGHT.
[ct=31.578] LITTLE POP-UP KICK AND JACOB
[ct=36.223] SAYLORS, FORMER UFL PLAYER WITH
[ct=36.496] THE ST. LOUIS BATTLEHAWKS SPINS
[ct=37.542] HIS WAY OUT ACROSS THE 30, AND
[ct=37.920] THAT’S IT.
[ct=41.151] FORWARD PROGRESS IS STOPPED.
[ct=44.631] IT’S A RETURN OF 22 YARD, AND
[ct=46.127] HERE COMES JARED GOFF.
[ct=49.669] LAST WEEK AGAINST THE BEARS
[ct=49.669] COMPLETED PASSES AT 82%.
[ct=51.798] YOU SEE THE YARDAGE.
[ct=66.024] JOHNSON CALLING PLAYS AND AS WE
[ct=67.093] TALKED ABOUT COMING INTO 9 GAME,
[ct=68.915] WEEK ONE DIDN’T GO AS HE WOULD
[ct=68.915] LIKE NOUR THE LIONS.
[ct=70.410] LAST WEEK THEY GOT BACK ON
[ct=70.878] TRACK.
[ct=71.766] ANOTHER BIG TEST ON THE ROAD
[ct=73.724] TONIGHT.
[ct=74.235] >> Joe: HERE’S GIBBS.
[ct=74.759] NOT MUCH.
[ct=78.818] THE ROOKIE MALAKI STARKS CAME
[ct=80.062] DOWN TO MAKE THE STOP, AND HE
[ct=80.900] WAS NOT ALONE.
[ct=83.899] WE’LL LOOK AT THE SKILL POSITION
[ct=86.614] PLAYERS FOR THE DETROIT LIONS,
[ct=88.469] AND THEY’RE AS GOOD AS ANY GROUP
[ct=89.688] HAS AROUND THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL
[ct=90.812] LEAGUE AND, TROY, THEIR
[ct=91.978] OFFENSIVE LINE LOOKS DIFFERENCE
[ct=93.176] THAN IT DID A YEAR AGO.
[ct=94.119] >> Troy: IT REALLY DOES.
[ct=95.642] THAT’S ALWAYS BEEN THE STRENGTH
[ct=96.597] WITH DAN CAMPBELL AS THE HEAD
[ct=102.404] COACH, BUT WHEN FRANK RETIRED
[ct=105.213] AND THEN KEVIN ZEITLER, HE WENT
[ct=106.369] TO TENNESSEE AND AFFECTED
[ct=108.629] POSITIONS.
[ct=109.994] >> Joe: GOFF HAS A WIDE-OPEN
[ct=110.304] JAMESON WILLIAMS AND A
[ct=112.124] CATCH, OUT OF BOUNDS NEAR THE
[ct=112.124] 40.
[ct=116.064] HE IS THEIR DOWNFIELD BIG CHUNK
[ct=116.930] YARDAGE RECEIVER, AND THAT ONE
[ct=117.246] GOOD FOR 24.
[ct=120.636] >> Troy: SUCH A GOOD JOB OF HIM
[ct=122.004] AS HE COMES OFF THE BALL,
[ct=123.393] BECAUSE OF THE SPEED THAT YOU
[ct=126.012] TALK ABOUT, JOE, HE GETS THE
[ct=127.333] SECONDARY TURNING AND RUNNING.
[ct=129.688] YOU SEE THE SAFETY, HOW HE JUST
[ct=130.919] CLEARS OUT BECAUSE OF THE DEEP
[ct=132.989] BALL THAT THEY’RE CONCERNED
[ct=132.989] ABOUT.
[ct=134.667] THEY SHOWED THAT LAST WEEK.
[ct=137.507] BIG TOUCHDOWN RECEPTION BY
[ct=138.741] JAMESON WILLIAMS IN THAT WIN
[ct=139.373] LAST WEEK AGAINST CHICAGO.
[ct=148.159] >> Joe: HANDOFF TO GIBBSS AND
[ct=151.791] RIGHT THERE IS OWEH, ODAFE OWEH
[ct=154.704] MAKES THE STOP WITH A LOSS OF
[ct=154.704] THREE.
[ct=157.857] >> Troy: THEY COME IN HERE AND
[ct=161.079] HAVE TWO TIGHT ENDS BUT THAT’S
[ct=163.257] BROCK WRIGHT, AND OWEH BEATS HIM
[ct=164.972] OFF THE BALL INSIDE AND JUST NO
[ct=167.708] TO GET ANYTHING GOING.
[ct=173.875] >> Joe: STRUGGLED TO RUN THE
[ct=176.068] BALL WEEK ONE AT GREEN BAY.
[ct=178.083] AGAINST CHICAGO.
[ct=180.273] HERE’S GIBBS AGAIN.
[ct=182.379] ABLE TO PICK HIS WAY AND MAKE
[ct=184.500] THIRD DOWN A LITTLE MORE
[ct=184.500] MANAGEABLE.
[ct=186.586] A GAIN OF SEVEN.
[ct=188.773] WE CAN LOOK AT THIS DEFE
[ct=190.833] BALTIMORE A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT
[ct=192.975] WAY, MAYBE THE EASIEST WAY IS TO
[ct=195.186] TELL YOU WHO IS NOT THERE.
[ct=197.262] AND THAT’S JAIRE ALEXANDE
[ct=199.352] SECOND STRAIGHT WEEK HE’S ON THE
[ct=201.517] SHELF STILL REHABBING THE KNEE,
[ct=203.659] NNAMDI MADUBUIKE WHO IS RIGHT
[ct=205.738] THERE ON YOUR SCREEN, A BIG
[ct=207.928] PRESENCE UP FRONT, AND THEIR
[ct=207.928] SACK LEADER FROM A
[ct=209.960] KYLE VAN NOY.
[ct=209.960] THIRD DOWN AND SIX.
[ct=222.610] GOFF PROTECTED.
[ct=224.861] FIRES, AND ANOTHER CATCH FOR
[ct=224.861] WILLIAMS.
[ct=229.091] HE’S GOT ONE FOR 24.
[ct=229.091] THIS ONE FOR 19.
[ct=233.426] AND JAMESON WILLIAMS, WHO
[ct=235.469] THEY’VE REWARDED WITH A NEW
[ct=235.469] CONTRACT, TWO BIG PLAY
[ct=237.618] >> Troy: YEAH, AND THE REASON
[ct=239.153] IS, HE HAS SO MUCH SPEED COMING
[ct=240.965] OFF THE BALL, THE RAVENS ARE
[ct=242.207] TRYING TO PLAY COVERAGE AND
[ct=245.096] THEY’RE TRYING TO RUN
[ct=247.079] UMAROV
[ct=247.079] UMBRELLA UP OVER THE TOP.
[ct=248.462] SEE HOW THE SAFETIES GET OUT OF
[ct=249.725] THERE.
[ct=250.311] THEY’RE WORRIED HE WILL GO DEEP
[ct=253.943] AND ALL OF THAT UNDERNEATH
[ct=254.700] COVERAGE THEN PENS UP FOR HIM
[ct=258.599] TO MAKE THE EASY COMPLETION.
[ct=259.434] MONTGOMERY WAS OUT
[ct=260.633] BLOCKING.
[ct=261.003] HE WENT TO THE RIGHT.
[ct=262.186] GIBBS WENT TO THE LEFT, AND
[ct=262.590] PICKS UP TWO.
[ct=267.917] WE HAVEN’T EVEN SEEN A CHECK ON
[ct=270.087] AMON-RA ST. BROWN, WHO IS THEIR
[ct=271.844] TOP THREAT ON THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=272.841] HE THEIR LEADING RECEIVER WITH
[ct=274.758] 13 CATCHES ALREADY THIS SEASON.
[ct=276.990] YOU CAN PENCIL HIM
[ct=279.306] PLUS CATCHES A YEAR.
[ct=279.522] HE DOES EVERYTHING.
[ct=281.517] HE’S KIND OF THE ANTI-DIVA.
[ct=282.191] HE BLOCKS.
[ct=284.727] HE’S A GREAT TEAMMATE.
[ct=286.480] JARED GOFF WOULD TAKE HIM OVER
[ct=287.827] EVERYBODY IF YOU PUT THEM ALL IN
[ct=288.508] A BIG DRAFT, HE’D TAKE 14.
[ct=292.550] >> Troy: PRETTY IMPRESSIVE WHEN
[ct=293.095] HE SAID HE’S THE BEST RECEIVER
[ct=294.093] HE’S EVER THROWN TO.
[ct=296.862] >> Joe: SECOND DOWN AND EIGHT.
[ct=298.894] GIBBS.
[ct=302.632] TRIED TO STAY IN BOUNDS, HIS
[ct=303.379] MOMENTUM CARRIED HIM OUT.
[ct=306.636] A GAIN OF FIVE, SO THIRD AND
[ct=308.044] SHORT COMING UP AND YOU KNOW THE
[ct=310.936] DEAL WITH DAN CAMPBELL.
[ct=311.257] ANY TIME HE GOT THIRD DOWN, YOU
[ct=316.955] THINK ABOUT FOURTH DOWN AND DAN
[ct=317.275] CAMPBELL, BODY GOES FOR FOURTH
[ct=321.416] DOWNS MORE THAN THAT HEAD COACH.
[ct=323.487] >> Troy: THIRD AND FIVE, IF IT’S
[ct=323.854] BEYOND THE 50 YARD LINE, HE’S
[ct=325.900] GOING FOR IT ON FOURTH DOWN OVER
[ct=327.263] 50% OF THE TIME, SO YOU LOOK AT
[ct=330.153] IT RIGHT NOW, AND
[ct=332.265] MORTON, THE OFFENSIVE
[ct=332.566] COORDINATOR SAID DAN CAMPBELL
[ct=333.933] WOULD HAVE TOLD HIM ALREADY IF
[ct=335.483] THEY’RE GOING FOR IT ON FOURTH
[ct=336.803] DOESN’T TO AFFECT WHAT HE MIGHT
[ct=337.371] NOW CALL ON THIRD.
[ct=343.359] >> Joe: CAME UNDERNEATH TO
[ct=343.996] INCOMPLETE.
[ct=346.715] AND WHAT DOES CAMPBELL DO?
[ct=347.628] HE COACHES THE OFFENSE OUT
[ct=349.104] THEY ALREADY KNEW IT.
[ct=350.395] GOFF WAS AWARE OF IT.
[ct=351.732] FOURTH AND THREE AND THEY’LL GO
[ct=352.068] FOR IT.
[ct=354.675] >> Troy: THE RIGHT IDEA.
[ct=355.964] I LIKE WHAT JARED GOFF WAS
[ct=357.622] TRYING TO DO, JUST REALLY A
[ct=360.292] MISCOMMUNICATION WITH HIM AND
[ct=362.800] JAHMYR GIBBS ON WHAT GIBBS WAS
[ct=364.183] DOING EXACTLY, BUT THERE’S THE
[ct=364.806] FIRST BIG DECISION FOR DAN
[ct=373.038] I ALWAYS LIKE COMING AWAY WITH
[ct=373.326] POINTS ON THE OPENING DRIVE ON
[ct=373.995] THE ROAD AGAINST A GOOD
[ct=374.305] OPPONENT.
[ct=377.892] WE’LL SEE IF THIS PAYS OFF
[ct=379.650] THEM.
[ct=380.913] >> Joe: A LOT OF MOVEMENT.
[ct=383.910] PLAY CLOCK AT 3.
[ct=384.513] GOFF, THERE’S ST. BROWN, FIRST
[ct=388.159] CATCH, A BIG ONE, FIRST IN GOAL
[ct=388.428] WORKING AGAINST KYLE HAMILTON
[ct=391.513] WHO MADE THE STOP.
[ct=392.375] JAHMYR GIBBS DELIVERED
[ct=394.516] BLOCK AND A GAIN OF SEVEN AND A
[ct=394.794] FRESH SET.
[ct=398.721] >> Troy: IT’S GOOD ON GOOD.
[ct=399.001] DOESN’T GET BETTER THAN THIS.
[ct=401.207] AMON-RA ST. BROWN AND KYLE
[ct=402.960] HAMILTON AND EXCELLENT ROUTE,
[ct=404.544] YOU TALKED ABOUT IT A MOMENT
[ct=405.900] AGO, ALL THE THINGS HE CAN DO.
[ct=407.634] HE DOESN’T TELEGRAPH IT.
[ct=408.897] HE COMES OFF THE LINE OF
[ct=409.251] SCRIMMAGE.
[ct=410.227] HAMILTON KNOWS THE DOWN AND
[ct=411.584] DISTANCE, HE KNOWS WHAT HE’S
[ct=412.934] GOING TO TRY TO DO, THE DEPTH,
[ct=414.671] BUT HE STILL COULDN’T JUMP IT
[ct=416.304] BECAUSE HE WAS SO DISCIPLINED IN
[ct=419.162] HOW HE RAN THE ROUTE.
[ct=425.561] FIGHTING.
[ct=427.646] AND HE’S GOING TO BE BROUGHT
[ct=427.646] DOWN AT THE 1.
[ct=429.307] SECOND DOWN AND GOAL AFTER GIBBS
[ct=430.343] GOT THREE.
[ct=437.047] AND THE LIONS WANT TO GO RIGHT
[ct=438.512] BACK TO THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE.
[ct=440.737] >> Troy: THEY WANT TO GET RIGHT
[ct=443.298] BACK ON THE LINE AND SEE IF THEY
[ct=445.027] CAN’T CATCH BALTIMORE JUST OFF A
[ct=446.651] LITTLE BIT, UNABLE TO GET A CALL
[ct=446.932] INTO THE DEFENSE.
[ct=451.827] >> Joe: GIBBS, TOUCHDOWN!
[ct=458.148] WHAT A GOOD START FOR THE LIONS.
[ct=462.374] THE CONVERSION ON FOURTH DOWN,
[ct=464.186] LAMAR JACKSON WILL TRY TO ANSWER
[ct=468.570] AND THE LIONS, WHO PUT UP 52 ON
[ct=469.180] THE BEARS, HAVE ONE POSSESSION
[ct=470.181] AND INTO THE END ZONE THEY GO.
[ct=475.283] >> Troy: A LOT OF AMON-RA ST.
[ct=476.340] BROWN HERE AS THE LEAD BLOCKER.
[ct=480.127] AN EXCELLENT JOB OF SEALING IT
[ct=481.871] AND KALIF RAYMOND GETTING UP
[ct=481.871] THERE AS WELL.
[ct=482.995] IF YOU PLAY WIDE RECEIVER, NOT
[ct=484.279] ONLY DO YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO
[ct=485.250] CATCH THE FOOTBALL THIS THIS
[ct=486.800] OFFENSE, YOU BETTER BE ABLE TO
[ct=488.574] BLOCK AND A WILLING BLOCKER AND
[ct=490.751] ALL OF THESE LIONS RECEIVERS ARE
[ct=490.751] CAPABLE OF THAT.
[ct=494.969] >> Joe: EXTRA POINT FROM JAKE
[ct=497.385] LOW SNAP.
[ct=498.068] KICK IS GOOD.
[ct=502.885] JARED GOFF TELLING US ABOUT ST.
[ct=504.801] BROWN.
[ct=506.562] THERE IS NO 100-CATCH RECEIVER
[ct=507.788] WHO BLOCKS LIKE ST. BROWN.
[ct=508.968] HE SEALED IT OFF.
[ct=510.414] GIBBS TAKES IT IN.
[ct=512.240] ON THE JOE
[ct=514.704] TESS AND STEVE LEVY.
[ct=515.297] GLAD YOU’RE WITH US TONIGHT.
[ct=517.075] WE’LL GIVE YOU THE NUMBERS AND
[ct=521.031] GET INTO THOSE NUMBERS JUST A
[ct=521.031] LITTLE BIT.
[ct=522.249] MORE WHEN LAMAR TAKES THE FIELD
[ct=523.814] HERE IN A SECOND AS THE LIONS
[ct=525.723] WENT DOWN AND SCORED, AND NOW
[ct=526.467] BATES KICKS IT AWAY.
[ct=530.073] IT LANDED IN THE LANDING ZONE
[ct=536.391] AND GOES INTO THE END ZONE.
[ct=551.236] IT COMES OUT TO THE 20 IS WHAT
[ct=555.529] PYHHAGORAST SAYS.
[ct=556.791] >> Troy: WE’VE CALLED SOME OF
[ct=558.274] THOSE GAMES AND PRETTY
[ct=559.368] IMPRESSIVE, WHAT HE DOES UNDER
[ct=559.698] THE LIGHTS.
[ct=564.309] HE JUST CONTINUES TO GET BETTER
[ct=566.357] AND BETTER AND PLAYING WITH AS
[ct=566.648] MUCH CONFIDENCE NOW AS I’VE
[ct=567.342] SEEN.
[ct=568.048] ESPECIALLY WITH HIS ABILITY IN
[ct=570.914] >> Joe: THEY FAKE IT TO DERRICK
[ct=573.464] HENRY AND WIDE OPEN IS ANDREWS.
[ct=575.506] THEY WANT TO GET HIM MORE
[ct=577.278] INVOLVED TONIGHT AND, MARK, WHO
[ct=579.205] HAD TWO CATCHES TOTAL OVER THE
[ct=580.388] FIRST TWO GAMES IS GOOD FOR
[ct=582.855] >> Troy: NOT A LOT OF
[ct=583.880] OPPORTUNITIES THE FIRST COUPLE
[ct=584.827] OF WEEKS BUT IT’S JUST A MATTER
[ct=586.886] OF TIME AND HERE THEY OPEN UP
[ct=589.222] THE THIRD WEEK WITH A PASS TO
[ct=590.742] OLD RELIABLE, NUMBER 89.
[ct=594.065] YOU KNOW IT WAS A TOUGH
[ct=594.647] OFF-SEASON FOR HIM THE WAY IT
[ct=596.397] ENDED WITH THAT PLAYOFF LOSS TO
[ct=597.699] BUFFALO, BUT HE’S ONE OF THE
[ct=599.278] ALL-TIME GREAT TIGHT ENDS, NO
[ct=600.762] DOUBT.
[ct=603.815] >> Joe: HE FUMBLED IN THAT
[ct=604.182] BUFFALO GAME.
[ct=606.308] HE DROPPED A POTENTIAL TWO-POINT
[ct=609.099] CONVERSION IN THE END ZONE.
[ct=609.736] HUTCHINSON WILL COST THE LIONS
[ct=614.650] >> Referee: NEUTRAL ZONE
[ct=614.940] INFRACTION.
[ct=618.867] FIVE-YARD PENALTY, FIRST DOWN.
[ct=620.996] >> Joe: JUST TO FINISH ON MARK
[ct=621.991] ANDREWS, AFTER THAT GAME HE
[ct=623.214] DIDN’T SPEAK WITH THE MEDIA BUT
[ct=624.538] HE WENT TO INSTAGRAM AND HE SAID
[ct=625.831] AMONG OTHER THINGS HE’S
[ct=627.150] ABSOLUTELY GUTTED BY WHAT
[ct=628.494] HAPPENED, AND THEN COMING INTO
[ct=629.463] THIS YEAR, I’M A PRO.
[ct=630.353] THAT’S WHAT I DO.
[ct=634.331] HE’S BACK, AND TALKING TO JOHN
[ct=634.331] HARBAUGH, HE SAID, IF YOU WANT
[ct=636.499] TO KNOW HIS
[ct=638.227] BLOCK.
[ct=638.894] >> Troy: I THOUGHT THAT WAS
[ct=641.264] INTERESTING SAYING IF HIS MIND
[ct=642.166] WASN’T IN IT, YOU WOULDN’T SEE
[ct=643.848] HIM BLOCKING AS WELL AS HE IS,
[ct=645.848] SAYS HE’S BLOCKING AS GOOD OVER
[ct=647.994] THE FIRST COUPLE OF WEEKS AS HE
[ct=648.629] HAS AT ANY TIME OF HIS CAREER.
[ct=654.376] >> Joe: I-FORMATION, HENRY WILL
[ct=654.650] TAKE THE BALL WITH A LEAD BACK
[ct=656.693] IN FRONT OF HIM AND JUST PLOW
[ct=656.943] FOR A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=662.845] TAKE A LOOK AT THIS OFFENSE FOR
[ct=664.044] BALTIMORE AS THEY’RE TRYING TO
[ct=665.013] ANSWER THE OPENING SALVO FROM
[ct=667.768] THE LIONS.
[ct=668.416] ZAY FLOWERS IS THEIR NUMBER ONE
[ct=669.081] RECEIVER.
[ct=670.037] WE JUST SAW DERRICK HENRY AND
[ct=672.144] SAW MARK ANDREWS ALREADY.
[ct=674.240] D. HOP IS STILL DOING IT AT 33
[ct=676.121] YEARS OLD, DeANDRE HOPKINS, AND
[ct=677.187] THE OFFENSIVE LINE, THAT CENTER
[ct=679.930] IS OUTSTANDING, TYLER
[ct=680.264] LINDERBAUM, TWO-TIME PRO BOWLER.
[ct=684.952] >> Troy: ONE OF THE BEST CENTERS
[ct=686.446] IN FOOTBALL AND ERIC DeCOSTA HAS
[ct=688.584] DONE A GREAT JOB PUTTING A LOT
[ct=689.827] OF GREAT PLAYERS AROUND LAMAR
[ct=691.747] JACKSON IN RECENT YEARS.
[ct=694.158] >> Joe: LAMAR KEEPS AND CUTS,
[ct=695.955] AND SLIPS.
[ct=697.981] BUT HAS ANOTHER FIRST DOWN FOR
[ct=699.214] THE RAVENS AS HE’S ABLE TO GET
[ct=699.214] 12.
[ct=704.053] >> Troy: YOU THINK YOU GOT HIM,
[ct=705.301] BUT YOU DON’T GOT HIM BECAUSE
[ct=706.932] IT’S LAMAR JACKSON AND DERRICK
[ct=709.233] BARNES WHO PUTS HIMSELF IN A
[ct=710.213] PERFECT POSITION TO BE ABLE TO
[ct=713.740] COME UP AND MAKE A PLAY, HE’S
[ct=713.740] RIGHT THERE, BUT THEN LAMAR IS
[ct=715.409] ABLE TO JUST CUT ON A DIME AND
[ct=720.281] GET IT GOING UP THE FIELD AND
[ct=722.015] HE’S NOT THE FIRST GUY THAT
[ct=723.311] WE’VE SEEN LAMAR DO THAT TO.
[ct=724.321] HE WON’T BE THE LAST.
[ct=724.660] NOT EVEN TONIGHT.
[ct=729.111] >> Joe: NO QUARTERBACK IN NFL
[ct=730.319] HISTORY HAS RUSHED FOR MORE
[ct=731.691] YARDS IN THE CAREER THAN LAMAR
[ct=733.435] JACKSON, FIRST DOWN, RAVENS,
[ct=734.046] QUICK THROW, ANDREWS AGAIN.
[ct=740.977] KERBY JOSEPH, THE ALL PRO MADE
[ct=742.553] THE STOP, BUT ANOTHER CHUNK OF
[ct=744.596] YARDAGE AND A GAIN OF EIGHT.
[ct=745.262] >> Troy: WHAT’S INTERESTING
[ct=747.808] ABOUT THAT, JOE, THE YARDAGE
[ct=748.792] HE’S HAD RUNNING THE FOOTBALL
[ct=750.059] THE NUMBERS HAVE GONE DOWN OVER
[ct=752.312] THE COURSE OF HIS CAREER, WHICH
[ct=753.597] IS, YOU’D EXPECT THAT WHEN
[ct=754.653] YOU’RE YOUNG, YOU DON’T SEE THE
[ct=755.437] DEFENSE AS WELL.
[ct=757.700] AND THEN AS YOU MATURE, YOU
[ct=760.375] START TO RECOGNIZE, READ
[ct=760.375] COVERAGES, ALL OF THAT.
[ct=762.846] BUT FOR LAMAR, IT’S THOSE THINGS
[ct=765.402] AND THEN IN ADDITION JUST HE’S
[ct=768.904] BEEN SURGICAL IN THE POCKET WHEN
[ct=769.553] HE’S HAD TIME AND FINDING OPEN
[ct=773.159] RECEIVERS.
[ct=773.426] >> Joe: HENRY GETS IT THIS TIME,
[ct=776.524] AND THE LIONS STEP UP, A GAIN OF
[ct=779.985] DERRICK BARNES, WHO WAS INVOLVED
[ct=781.401] IN THAT RUN BY LAMAR JACKSON A
[ct=781.800] MOMENT AGO MADE THAT STOP.
[ct=784.270] IT’S THIRD DOWN AND ONE.
[ct=786.356] AIDAN HUTCHINSON UP FRONT IS
[ct=787.675] KIND OF THE LAST MAN STANDING.
[ct=791.330] THEY PUT MARCUS DAVENPORT ON
[ct=794.753] I.R. TODAY, THEIR LINEBACKER IS
[ct=796.609] REAL GOOD WITH ANZALONE AND
[ct=798.993] CAMPBELL AND BRIAN BRANCH IS
[ct=800.268] JUST ALL OVER THE PLACE FOR THE
[ct=800.881] LIONS.
[ct=801.596] >> Troy: THERE ARE SO MANY GOOD
[ct=804.285] PLAYERS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE
[ct=804.540] BALL FOR BOTH THESE TEAMS AS WE
[ct=805.604] TAKE A LOOK AT KELVIN SHEPPARD.
[ct=810.682] >> Joe: EASY PICKUP, FORGET
[ct=810.682] FIRST DOWN.
[ct=812.317] HOW ABOUT TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=813.548] THERE IS A FLAG ON THE FAR SIDE
[ct=816.210] OF THE FIELD.
[ct=821.774] AND THIS WILL --
[ct=823.838] >> Referee: 95, LINED UP FROM
[ct=823.838] THE NEUTRAL ZONE.
[ct=824.488] PENALTY DECLINED.
[ct=828.169] RESULT OF THE PLAY, TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=830.941] >> Joe: I MEAN, DERRICK HENRY
[ct=832.313] JUST GLIDING TO THE END ZONE.
[ct=833.618] THEY NEEDED ONE FOR A FIRST
[ct=835.244] THEY GOT 28 FOR A TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=843.672] >> Troy: ROGER ROSENGARTEN HE
[ct=844.647] COMES OFF THE BALL.
[ct=847.655] HE DOES AN OUTSTANDING JOB
[ct=849.726] SEALING IT AND THEN THERE’S MARK
[ct=849.726] ANDREWS.
[ct=850.779] WE TALKED ABOUT HIS BLOCKING AS
[ct=854.081] HE GETS UP TO THE SECOND LEVEL.
[ct=856.501] ROSENGARTEN CLEARS THINGS OUT
[ct=857.408] AND MARK ANDREWS IS THERE TO
[ct=858.101] SEAL TO ALLOW HENRY ON THE EDGE.
[ct=860.756] IT’S AN OUTSTANDING JOB OF
[ct=860.756] EXECUTION.
[ct=867.102] >> Joe: THE ROOKIE, TYLER LOOP,
[ct=869.556] TIES THE GAME.
[ct=871.667] LAST WEEK AGAINST CLEVELAND HERE
[ct=873.711] AT HOME DERRICK HENRY, 11
[ct=874.398] CARRIES, 23 YARDS.
[ct=877.489] HE’S ALREADY GOT 36 TONIGHT.
[ct=883.651] INCLUDING THAT 28-YARD GLIDE TO
[ct=884.964] TIE IT AT 7.THAT YOU’LL
[ct=888.619] SEE FROM M&T BANK STADIUM HERE
[ct=888.619] IN BALTIMORE.
[ct=892.914] AS LOOP KICKS IT AWAY.
[ct=895.270] SAYLORS AGAIN.
[ct=899.218] FULL HEAD OF STEAM, AND KNOCKED
[ct=900.912] DOWN AS HE CROSSED THE 30.
[ct=903.474] WE’LL GO DOWN TO LISA.
[ct=905.602] >> Lisa: YEAH, JOE, DERRICK
[ct=906.592] HENRY SAID WHAT HAD BEEN ON HIS
[ct=907.923] MIND ALL WEEK LONG THE FACT THAT
[ct=909.170] HE FUMBLED IN EACH OF THE FIRST
[ct=912.272] TWO GAMES OF THE SEASON AND HAD
[ct=912.938] THE 23 RUSHING YARDS AGAINST THE
[ct=913.273] BROWNS.
[ct=914.582] FOR HIM HE SAID IF HE HADN’T
[ct=916.283] BEEN PLAYING UP TO STANDARDS AND
[ct=918.739] DIDN’T CARE IF THE BROWNS WERE
[ct=919.403] BASICALLY STACKING THE BOX AND
[ct=920.610] SELLING OUT TO STOP THE RUN, HE
[ct=922.229] SAID IT’S HIGGS JOB TO MAKE
[ct=925.096] SOMETHING HAPPEN NO MATTER WHAT.
[ct=926.626] LAST WEEK WAS HIS FAULT, HE’D
[ct=927.901] BEEN REPLAYING IT ALL WEEK IN
[ct=929.643] HIS MIND AND COULD NOT WAIT TO
[ct=931.883] GET OUT HERE TONIGHT AND BREAK
[ct=931.883] LOOSE.
[ct=933.602] >> Joe: YEAH, LISA, AS IF A MAN
[ct=940.479] THAT SIZE, 6’3", 232 NEEDS ANY
[ct=942.658] MORE INSPIRATION TO GO AFTER A
[ct=946.846] TEAM, HE IS INSPIRED TONIGHT,
[ct=946.846] THAT WAS AN INCOMPLETE PASS.
[ct=950.292] THE PRESSURE BY MARLON HUMPHREY
[ct=951.449] WHO CAME ON A
[ct=953.224] WAS A LIVE BALL.
[ct=953.882] THAT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS FORWARD
[ct=955.362] PASS TO ME.
[ct=956.031] >> Troy: IT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS
[ct=957.846] FORWARD PASS TO ME AS WELL.
[ct=958.156] YOU’RE RIGHT.
[ct=960.256] THEY BROUGHT MARLON HUMPHREY IN,
[ct=961.627] AS YOU SEE, AMON-RA ST. BROWN,
[ct=962.187] HE COMES ACROSS.
[ct=963.794] HE’S GOING TO TRY TO PICK THAT
[ct=965.588] HERE’S A LOOK AT WHETHER OR NOT
[ct=966.803] IT WAS LIVE.
[ct=968.910] YEAH, I THINK IT’S PRETTY CLEAR
[ct=969.753] THAT THAT WAS --
[ct=971.433] >> Joe: WELL, THEY CALLED THAT
[ct=973.430] BACKWARD, AND THEY MOVED THE
[ct=976.147] BALL BACK, SO NOW IT’S SECOND
[ct=976.867] AND 19 INSTEAD OF SECOND AND
[ct=977.166] TEN.
[ct=984.393] I DON’T AGREE WITH THAT CALL.
[ct=984.645] HERE’S GIBBS OVER THE RIGHT
[ct=986.207] SIDE, AND HE WAS STOOD UP AT THE
[ct=987.123] LINE OF SCRIMMAGE AND GOT TO THE
[ct=988.904] EDGE.
[ct=993.836] AS MIKE GREEN MADE THAT PLAY, NO
[ct=993.836] GAIN.
[ct=994.714] LET’S GO BACK TO THAT FIRST DOWN
[ct=1000.094] >> IT LOOKS LIKE THE BALL IS
[ct=1003.110] RELEASED RIGHT AT ABOUT THE 23
[ct=1003.764] YARD LINE AND THEN THE QUESTION
[ct=1008.246] IS WHEN IT’S FIRST TOUCHED BY A
[ct=1010.366] DETROIT TEAMMATE AND LOOKS LIKE
[ct=1011.434] IT’S AT THE 23 YARD LINE, I
[ct=1012.798] THINK IT’S FORWARD BUT TOO CLOSE
[ct=1015.186] THEY WOULDN’T HAVE CHANGED IT IF
[ct=1015.792] CHALLENGED.
[ct=1019.362] >> Troy: THEY’RE NOT USUALLY
[ct=1019.362] CALLING THEM THAT TIGHT ON A
[ct=1022.013] BACKWARDS,
[ct=1024.636] BACKWARD S PASS, ARE THEY.
[ct=1025.347] >> NO.
[ct=1026.343] >> Joe: NOW IT’S THIRD DOWN AND
[ct=1027.523] 19.
[ct=1030.024] THE SILENT COUNT.
[ct=1032.135] THEY SET UP A SCREEN FOR GIBBS
[ct=1032.788] AND HE’S BROUGHT DOWN AT THE 30.
[ct=1036.349] WELL SHORT OF A FIRST DOWN BY
[ct=1037.016] TEDDYE BUCHANAN, A ROOKIE
[ct=1038.522] LOVE.
[ct=1039.097] >> Troy: YEAH, REALLY HARD WHEN
[ct=1040.544] YOU’RE GOING UP AGAINST ANY
[ct=1042.853] DEFENSE BUT ESPECIALLY ONE AS
[ct=1043.499] TALENTED AS THIS RAVENS GROUP.
[ct=1045.251] WHEN YOU GET BEHIND THE STICKS,
[ct=1049.206] YOU KNOW, AFTER THAT RULING ON
[ct=1049.565] FIRST DOWN, THEN IT BECOMES A
[ct=1050.906] FIELD POSITION GAME ON THIRD
[ct=1052.587] DOWN TRYING TO GIVE AS MUCH
[ct=1054.613] YARDS AS YOU CAN IF YOU CAN’T
[ct=1055.942] BACK THEM UP A LITTLE BIT, BUT
[ct=1057.525] WHAT WE’VE SEEN FROM THE RAVENS
[ct=1060.367] ON BOTH POSSESSIONS, NOW,
[ct=1060.618] GRANTED THE FIRST ONE THE LIONS
[ct=1061.647] TOOK IT DOWN FOR A TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=1062.890] THEY’RE PLAYING A LOT OF
[ct=1065.029] COVERAGE AND THEY’RE INVITING
[ct=1068.452] THE LIONS TO TRY TO RUN THE
[ct=1069.481] FOOTBALL AGAINST SOME
[ct=1071.865] LOOKS.
[ct=1071.865] THE LYONS HAVEN’T HAD SUCCESS
[ct=1072.474] WHEN THEY TRIED IT.
[ct=1078.246] >> Joe: JACK FOX TO PUNT.
[ct=1080.380] HITS A BEAUTY.
[ct=1085.023] LaJOHNTAY WESTER IS BACK, FEELS
[ct=1088.968] -- FIELDS AND GETS HIT HARD.NS.
[ct=1091.145] GET $100 IN BONUS BETS WHEN YOU
[ct=1091.832] MAKE YOUR FIRST $10 BET.
[ct=1095.326] >> Joe: SECOND POSSESSION FOR
[ct=1096.304] THE RAVENS, AND THEY WILL START
[ct=1101.733] THIS POSSESSION AT THEIR 27.
[ct=1104.560] WE TALK A LOT ABOUT DERRICK
[ct=1105.180] HENRY AND THE SIZE.
[ct=1108.105] HIS SPEED IS INCREDIBLE, AND THE
[ct=1110.236] POWER THAT HE GETS GOING IN SUCH
[ct=1114.489] A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME, HE AND
[ct=1118.699] JAHMYR GIBBS, THE LIONS’ TOP
[ct=1121.096] BACK, GET IT GOING FAST, AND
[ct=1122.090] WE’LL SHOW YOU SOME OF THE
[ct=1123.731] NUMBERS THAT WE CAN PUT TO HOW
[ct=1126.458] THEY GET ROLLING WHEN THE BALL
[ct=1127.893] IS SNAPPED.
[ct=1134.248] I-FORMATION BEHIND JACKSON, WHO
[ct=1138.501] KEEPS, AND OF DERRICK HENRY.
[ct=1140.641] >> Troy: AND ONE IS 200 POUNDS
[ct=1141.936] IN GIBBS AND ONE IS 250 POUNDS.
[ct=1147.010] >> Joe: HE DIDN’T GET ROLLING
[ct=1147.302] THIS TIME.
[ct=1148.769] HE GOT STOPPED.
[ct=1150.416] CAMPBELL IN ON THE STOP AND
[ct=1152.001] HERE’S DERRICK HENRY ON THAT
[ct=1152.983] CARRY FOR THE TOUCHDOWN ON A
[ct=1153.652] THIRD AND ONE.
[ct=1155.780] >> Troy: YOU GET A GUY THAT BIG
[ct=1156.939] WITH THAT KIND OF SPEED, YOU
[ct=1159.305] KNOW, YOU DON’T SEE HIM CAUGHT
[ct=1161.151] VERY MANY TIMES FROM BEHIND, AND
[ct=1162.747] IT’S A LETHAL COMBINATION AS
[ct=1165.525] WE’VE SEEN THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER
[ct=1166.863] AND THE DURABILITY THAT HE HAS
[ct=1169.923] SHOWN AND, YOU KNOW, WHAT’S
[ct=1171.200] REMARKABLE, JOE, AS MUCH AS HE’S
[ct=1172.816] BEEN THE BELL COW FOR SO MANY
[ct=1174.166] YEARS IN THE LEAGUE HE HAS A
[ct=1175.780] LITTLE OVER 50% OF THE CARRIES
[ct=1178.298] THAT EMMITT SMITH HAD IN HIS
[ct=1180.748] CAREER SO GIVES YOU AN IDEA HOW
[ct=1182.881] DURABLE EMMITT SMITH WAS.
[ct=1184.749] HE MISSED FOUR GAMES IN THE 13
[ct=1185.677] YEARS WITH THE COWBOYS.
[ct=1187.155] PRETTY IMPRESSIVE.
[ct=1187.798] >> Joe: THIRD AND THREE AND THIS
[ct=1188.451] ONE FOR JUSTICE HILL IS
[ct=1195.651] IF YOU CAUGHT IT BUT LAMAR’S
[ct=1196.575] FRUSTRATED THAT HE MISSED HILL
[ct=1196.918] ON THAT THROW.
[ct=1199.860] IT’S FOURTH DOWN AND A PUNT
[ct=1202.057] UPCOMING BUT DERRICK HENRY WAS
[ct=1204.751] AT 11 1/2 MILES PER HOUR WHEN HE
[ct=1205.806] HIT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE ON
[ct=1208.531] THAT 28-YARD TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=1209.787] >> Troy: LIKE I SAID, AT 250
[ct=1212.761] POUNDS, THERE’S NOT A LINEBACKER
[ct=1213.763] FOR THE LIONS THAT WEIGHS 250
[ct=1214.106] POUNDS.
[ct=1217.594] AND SO HE’S BIGGER THAN THOSE
[ct=1219.812] GUYS THAT ARE MOSTLY TRYING TO
[ct=1220.450] TACKLE HIM.
[ct=1221.813] YOU GOT TO GET HIM AT THE LINE
[ct=1222.106] OF SCRIMMAGE.
[ct=1223.089] IT’S HAPPENED A FEW TIMES
[ct=1224.102] TONIGHT, BUT THAT’S THE KEY.
[ct=1228.591] >> Joe: HERE’S KALIF RAYMOND WHO
[ct=1230.728] FIELDED THE PUNT INSIDE HIS 5.
[ct=1231.732] THERE’S A FLAG DOWN ON THE PLAY.
[ct=1234.328] AND RAYMOND JUST SHOULD HAVE LET
[ct=1235.056] IT GO INTO THE END ZONE.
[ct=1239.250] T.J. TAMPA MADE THE TACKLE.
[ct=1242.515] IT WAS A 63-YARD PUNT, AND A
[ct=1244.460] FLAG WAS THROWN EARLY.
[ct=1248.006] >> Referee: DURING THE KICK,
[ct=1248.589] HOLDING, RECEIVING TEAM, NUMBER
[ct=1249.439] 4.
[ct=1251.435] HALF THE DISTANCE TO THE GOAL.
[ct=1255.616] >> Joe: BACK HIM UP.
[ct=1256.235] >> Troy: THAT WILL TAKE THE BALL
[ct=1258.685] INSIDE THE 5.
[ct=1260.791] SO JARED GOFF AND COMPANY BACK
[ct=1261.075] TO WORK.
[ct=1263.846] TEAMS WHO HAD TWO REAL TOUGH
[ct=1265.359] LOSSES TO SWALLOW IN
[ct=1267.492] AND THREE.
[ct=1268.498] BOTH GAMES WILL BE AVAILABLE ON
[ct=1271.777] THE ALL NEW ESPN APP.
[ct=1276.039] >> Troy: SO EARLY IN THE SEASON,
[ct=1276.312] THERE’S A LOT OF LEFT TO BE
[ct=1278.105] PLAYED BUT A LOT OF ANGST.
[ct=1282.328] FOR SOME OF THESE TEAMS THAT
[ct=1284.763] HAVE A LITTLE URGENCY INTO WEEK
[ct=1286.712] FOUR.
[ct=1286.953] >> Joe: LIONS STARTING AT THEIR
[ct=1288.781] 1 1/2 AND THEY START WITH THEIR
[ct=1292.516] BIGGER BACK OF THE TWO, THAT’S
[ct=1292.516] DAVID MONTGOMERY WHO IS ABLE TO
[ct=1295.131] PUSH THE PILE FORWARD AND HE
[ct=1297.239] GETS FOUR, TAVIUS ROBINSON WAS
[ct=1298.189] IN THERE WITH HELP ON THE STOP.
[ct=1299.207] >> Troy: THAT’S A GOOD JOB.
[ct=1300.554] THAT’S A GOOD SIGN.
[ct=1301.422] I KNOW COMING INTO THE GAME WE
[ct=1303.485] TALKED ABOUT THE YOUNG GUARDS
[ct=1306.508] THAT THE LIONS HAVE AND
[ct=1308.605] CHRISTIAN MAHOGANY, LEFT GUARD
[ct=1309.263] THEN TATE RATLEDGE, THE ROOKIE
[ct=1310.782] AT RIGHT GUARD AND HOW THEY
[ct=1312.905] HANDLED WEEK ONE, IT WAS A
[ct=1315.549] STRUGGLE, AND LAST WEEK WAS GOOD
[ct=1317.387] AT HOME, BUT HERE’S ANOTHER TEST
[ct=1320.474] ON THE ROAD, RAVENS KNEW WHAT
[ct=1321.560] THEY WERE GOING TO DO ON FIRST
[ct=1323.995] THEY GOT PRETTY GOOD MOVEMENT.
[ct=1326.133] >> Joe: FLAG ON THE PLAY, AS
[ct=1326.780] MONTGOMERY IS WRAPPED UP IN THE
[ct=1327.520] BACKFIELD.
[ct=1332.517] THAT PLAY IS MADE BY JOHN
[ct=1332.793] JENKINS.
[ct=1334.657] HE’S BEEN DOING IT A LONG TIME,
[ct=1335.643] 13 YEARS.
[ct=1337.418] HERE’S THE CALL FROM BILL
[ct=1339.233] VINOVICH.
[ct=1348.006] >> Referee: ILLEGAL
[ct=1351.927] COVERED UP BY THE WIDE RECEIVER,
[ct=1354.018] THE PENALTY IS DECLINED.
[ct=1355.721] RESULT OF THE PLAY A THIRD DOWN.
[ct=1356.292] >> Joe: TAKE THE RESULT OF THE
[ct=1358.037] PLAY, A LOSS OF ONE AND THAT
[ct=1359.581] BRINGS UP THIRD AND LONG.
[ct=1360.618] >> Troy: YEAH, THEY WERE ABLE TO
[ct=1361.936] DECLINE THE PLAY BECAUSE OF THE
[ct=1362.563] JOB BY JOHN JENKINS RIGHT IN THE
[ct=1363.218] MIDDLE.
[ct=1365.337] GLASGOW, WHO IS THE STARTER AND
[ct=1367.498] LEFT GUARD LAST YEAR MOVES TO
[ct=1369.667] CENTER THIS YEAR, AND JENKINS
[ct=1371.409] JUST TOSSES HIM ASIDE AND IS
[ct=1374.220] ABLE TO MAKE THE PLAY FOR THE
[ct=1378.548] ONE-YARD LOSS.
[ct=1380.608] >> Joe: FRANK RAGNOW RETIRED IN
[ct=1381.317] JUNE.
[ct=1381.671] THIRD DOWN AND SEVEN.
[ct=1395.013] GOFF PROTECTED AND HE FINDS HIS
[ct=1395.620] TIGHT END LaPORTA.
[ct=1400.091] A DRIVE THAT STARTED AT THE
[ct=1402.256] 1 1/2 AND SAM LaPORTA HAS HIS
[ct=1402.922] TENTH CATCH OF THE SEASON, FIRST
[ct=1403.573] OF THE NIGHT, GOOD FOR TEN.
[ct=1406.854] >> Troy: YEAH, MALAKI STARKS,
[ct=1408.612] ANOTHER ROOKIE, HE’S NUMBER 24
[ct=1411.483] FOR THE RAVENS WHO’S ASSIGNED
[ct=1412.289] LaPORTA IN MAN COVERAGE TO TRY
[ct=1413.281] TO GUARD HIM.
[ct=1414.641] LaPORTA COMES IN, MAYBE GETS A
[ct=1415.760] LITTLE BIT OF A PUSH AT THE TOP
[ct=1417.405] OF THAT ROUTE, CREATING SOME
[ct=1420.491] SEPARATION BUT THERE WAS NO
[ct=1422.678] QUESTION, ONCE GOFF SEES THE
[ct=1423.400] COVERAGE, KNOWING THAT HE HAD
[ct=1424.555] LaPORTA UP AGAINST THE ROOKIE
[ct=1429.004] SAFETY.
[ct=1434.375] >> Joe: THAT’S IT FOR QUARTER
[ct=1436.192] NUMBER ONE HERE AT M&T BANK
[ct=1439.905] STADIUM.
[ct=1440.200] 7-7 GAME, FIRST DOWN FOR THE
[ct=1442.917] LIONS WITH THE BALL OUTSIDE
[ct=1443.541] THEIR 15 WHEN WE COME BACK.
[ct=1447.534] HERE AT THE END OF WEEK THREE.
[ct=1450.536] DAY COVERAGE.
[ct=1452.653] >> CHECK YOUR PRICE TODAY AT
[ct=1452.653] ETHOS COMM.
[ct=1454.665] >> Joe: 7-7 BALL GAME AS WE
[ct=1459.202] START THE SECOND QUARTER.
[ct=1461.249] NICE FIRST DOWN PICKED UP BY
[ct=1461.249] LaPORTA AND GOFF.
[ct=1463.131] JARED GOFF, WHO WAS THE FIRST
[ct=1464.111] OVERALL PICK IN 2016 WITH THE
[ct=1464.549] RAMS.
[ct=1469.914] TOOK THE RAMS TO SUPER BOWL LIII
[ct=1472.080] IN 2018, LOST TO THE PATRIOTS,
[ct=1472.417] 13-3.
[ct=1476.289] A COUPLE YEARS LATER TRADED TO
[ct=1476.601] THE LIONS, IT WAS A SHOCK, IT
[ct=1478.347] WAS A SURPRISE, CALLED IT THE
[ct=1479.810] BEST THING THAT’S HAPPENED TO
[ct=1482.016] HIM IN HIS CAREER, AND HE HAS
[ct=1485.076] TAKEN OFF SINCE GETTING TO
[ct=1485.820] DETROIT.
[ct=1486.209] 6 FOR 7 TONIGHT.
[ct=1491.168] 37 TOUCHDOWN PASSES A YEAR AGO.
[ct=1493.894] PLAY ACTION.
[ct=1495.429] HE’S GOT MONTGOMERY OUT OF THE
[ct=1498.127] BACKFIELD, AND DAVID MONTGOMERY
[ct=1499.471] GETS A BLOCK FROM LaPORTA AND
[ct=1500.472] LOWERS HIS SHOULDER AND GETS 11.
[ct=1504.591] MARLON HUMPHREY MISSED A TACKLE
[ct=1505.247] ALONG THE WAY.
[ct=1508.940] LaPORTA GOT IN THE WAY AND THEN
[ct=1509.255] DAVID MONTGOMERY PUT AN
[ct=1510.774] EXCLAMATION POINT AT THE END OF
[ct=1511.110] IT.
[ct=1512.149] >> Troy: GOOD JOB BY JARED GOFF
[ct=1513.465] BECAUSE AS I MENTIONED, THE
[ct=1515.052] RAVENS ARE TRYING TO DISGUISE
[ct=1516.397] COVERAGE AND GO TO A TWO DEEP
[ct=1518.265] HERE, AND HE KNOWS HE DOESN’T
[ct=1520.364] HAVE WHAT HE WANTS DOWN THE
[ct=1520.364] FIELD AND COMES DOWN
[ct=1521.014] IMMEDIATELY.
[ct=1522.075] CHECKS IT DOWN TO MONTGOMERY AND
[ct=1526.399] THEN HE MAKES ROQUAN SMITH MISS,
[ct=1527.514] AND THEN SAM LaPORTA, HE’S OUT
[ct=1529.451] THERE MAKING A KEY BLOCK, SO
[ct=1531.249] THIS HAS BEEN A SUCCESSFUL DRIVE
[ct=1532.275] ALREADY, JUST GETTING THE BALL
[ct=1535.485] OFF THEIR OWN GOAL LINE.
[ct=1535.485] >> Joe: PLAY ACTION FROM GOFF.
[ct=1537.614] AND HE’S GOING TO GO AND A NICE
[ct=1537.897] PICKUP ON FIRST DOWN.
[ct=1539.323] HE DOESN’T DO IT A LOT.
[ct=1542.161] ONLY FIVE RUSHED YARDS THROUGH
[ct=1543.270] THE FIRST TWO GAMES.
[ct=1544.774] HE GETS FIVE HERE.
[ct=1545.436] >> Troy: HE’S GOT ENOUGH.
[ct=1547.281] HE CAN GET OUT OF DANGER EVERY
[ct=1548.783] NOW AND THEN BUT, YOU KNOW,
[ct=1550.864] THERE’S ALWAYS THIS CONVERSATION
[ct=1552.703] ABOUT JARED GOFF THAT WHEN HE
[ct=1553.977] HAD PRESSURE, THAT HE DIDN’T
[ct=1555.386] HANDLE IT VERY WELL AND HE
[ct=1556.791] PROBABLY DIDN’T REAL EARLY IN
[ct=1558.088] HIS CAREER WHEN HE WAS WITH THE
[ct=1560.163] HE HANDLES THE PRESSURE JUST
[ct=1561.167] FINE, AS LONG AS HE DOESN’T HAVE
[ct=1564.498] TO MOVE OFF HIS SPOT, BUT WHEN
[ct=1565.851] YOU GET HIM OFF THE SPOT WITH
[ct=1567.943] PRESSURE, THAT IS WHEN HE HASN’T
[ct=1570.878] BEEN QUITE AS EFFECTIVE.
[ct=1571.449] >> Joe: BOTH BACKS IN THE GAME.
[ct=1572.145] GIBBS, NOWHERE TO GO.
[ct=1577.510] MARLON HUMPHREY GOT THROUGH.
[ct=1581.139] MALAKI STARKS FORCED HIM OUT AND
[ct=1581.719] A LOSS OF THREE ON THE PLAY AS
[ct=1583.076] THAT THING WAS BLOWN UP BY THIS
[ct=1586.060] RAVENS DEFENSE.
[ct=1587.599] >> Troy: WELL, MARLON HUMPHREY,
[ct=1587.899] THIS GUY HAS BEEN DOING IT A
[ct=1590.510] LONG TIME, AND FOR HIM TO BE ONE
[ct=1592.655] OF THE BETTER COVER GUYS AND
[ct=1595.090] THEN COME UP AND DO WHAT HE DOES
[ct=1597.895] IN THE RUN GAME, YOU SEE THAT
[ct=1600.152] FROM BOTH SIDES, WHETHER IT’S
[ct=1603.670] THE LIONS’ DBs OR THE RAVENS’
[ct=1604.638] DBs, THESE GUYS ARE PURE
[ct=1605.383] FOOTBALL PLAYERS.
[ct=1610.268] TIP MY HAT TO THESE PERSONNEL
[ct=1610.268] WHO BRING THEM IN.
[ct=1611.771] HE’S BEEN PLAYING AT THAT LEVEL
[ct=1612.698] FOR A LONG TIME.
[ct=1613.346] >> Joe: THIRD DOWN AND EIGHT.
[ct=1615.108] GOFF SLINGS IT.
[ct=1618.713] LaPORTA, FIRST DOWN.
[ct=1620.912] THAT IS BACK-TO-BACK THIRD
[ct=1624.329] HE’S FOUND SAM LaPORTA, WHO IS A
[ct=1625.980] PRO BOWLER IN HIS ROOKIE YEAR
[ct=1627.520] LAST YEAR, TAPERED OFF A LITTLE.
[ct=1629.890] GETS 14 HERE.
[ct=1632.015] >> Troy: WHEN YOU SHOW THE LOOKS
[ct=1633.994] AS THE RAVENS ARE DOING THEY
[ct=1633.994] DISGUISE THINGS, THEY TURN AND
[ct=1636.359] TRY TO RUN UNDERNEATH THINGS AND
[ct=1637.012] DON’T KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THE
[ct=1638.807] LANDMARKS, SO WHEN YOU COME OFF
[ct=1641.771] THE BALL, SAM LaPORTA, JUST GO
[ct=1643.750] WIT OR NOT AND YOU SEE THE OPEN
[ct=1645.106] SPACE AND CHEMISTRY HE HAS WITH
[ct=1647.344] PRETTY EASY CONNECTION.
[ct=1650.049] >> Joe: LIONS MOVING THE
[ct=1651.915] KEEPING LAMAR JACKSON OFF THE
[ct=1654.373] FIELD.
[ct=1657.103] ON FIRST DOWN, MONTGOMERY.
[ct=1659.303] BOY, THIS DEFENSIVE FRONT THAT
[ct=1660.713] IS PLAYING WITHOUT ONE OF THE
[ct=1662.344] BEST DEFENDERS, NOT JUST ON THE
[ct=1665.507] RAVENS, BUT IN THE LEAGUE IN
[ct=1666.843] NNAMDI MADUBUIKE HAS DONE A NICE
[ct=1668.174] JOB UP FRONT IN THE RUN GAME.
[ct=1669.551] >> Troy: THEY REALLY HAVE AND
[ct=1671.367] WITHOUT KYLE VAN NOY, ANOTHER
[ct=1672.300] PRO BOWL PLAYER, LED THE TEAM IN
[ct=1676.292] SACKS LAST WEEK SO ZACH ORR, THE
[ct=1676.993] DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR, HAS HIS
[ct=1678.114] HANDS FULL TONIGHT TRYING TO
[ct=1679.427] COME UP WITH WAYS TO SLOW DOWN
[ct=1680.785] THE OFFENSE BUT HE’S CHANGED
[ct=1681.845] WHAT THEY DO A LITTLE BIT.
[ct=1685.277] REMEMBER WINK MARTINDALE, THEY H
[ct=1686.319] THEY BROUGHT EVERYTHING IN THE
[ct=1689.070] KITCHEN SINK AND EVEN WITH
[ct=1691.474] MACDONALD, THEY WERE MORE --
[ct=1693.632] IT’S NOT AS MUCH A BLITZING
[ct=1693.917] DEFENSE AS THEY WERE IN THE
[ct=1695.412] >> Joe: GOOD CARRY BY
[ct=1695.412] MONTGOMERY.
[ct=1698.219] STRONG RUN.
[ct=1698.553] HE’S ABOUT A HALF YARD SHORT OF
[ct=1699.174] A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=1701.218] THE FORMER THIRD ROUND PICK BY
[ct=1705.135] THE BEARS CAME AS AN
[ct=1705.135] UNRESTRICTED FREE AGENT TO THE
[ct=1707.880] LIONS, AND HE AND GIBBS MAKE THE
[ct=1709.588] BEST TANDEM IN THE LEAGUE.
[ct=1710.577] >> Troy: YOU KNOW, SAM LaPORTA,
[ct=1713.950] AS I WATCHED HIM THIS WEEK, I
[ct=1714.502] THINK HE A VERY UNDERRATED
[ct=1716.308] BLOCKER.
[ct=1717.226] HE’S ONE OF THE BEST TIGHT ENDS
[ct=1718.447] CATCHING THE FOOTBALL, BUT HE
[ct=1719.901] GETS IN THERE AND HE MIXES IT UP
[ct=1721.615] AND I TALKED TO DAN CAMPBELL
[ct=1722.999] ABOUT IT THIS WEEK AND HE SAID
[ct=1724.185] THAT’S THE AREA WHERE HE’S
[ct=1726.025] IMPROVED THE MOST, AND HE HAS NO
[ct=1728.650] RESERVATIONS OF HAVING HIM BLOCK
[ct=1729.441] A DEFENSIVE END ONE-ON-ONE.
[ct=1734.981] HE’S GOT THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=1739.230] SO, THE DRIVE WILL CONTINUE.
[ct=1741.371] AND SAM LaPORTA IS ON THAT LONG
[ct=1742.823] LIST OF IOWA TIGHT ENDS THAT
[ct=1745.593] HAVE COME INTO THE NATIONAL
[ct=1745.593] FOOTBALL LEAGUE AND JUST BEEN
[ct=1748.096] OUTSTANDING.
[ct=1748.805] >> Troy: YEAH, WHATEVER IS IN
[ct=1750.729] THE WATER THERE, BOY, THEY’RE
[ct=1751.825] RAISING THEM SOME GOOD TIGHT
[ct=1752.927] ENDS.
[ct=1754.058] THERE’S NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT.
[ct=1755.730] >> Joe: LOOK AT YOU GOING
[ct=1756.445] COUNTRY ON THAT.
[ct=1757.671] >> Troy: THERE’S SOME GOOD TIGHT
[ct=1758.416] ENDS, BABY.
[ct=1761.006] THIS DRIVE IS DEMORALIZING FOR A
[ct=1761.925] DEFENSE.
[ct=1763.347] YOU GOT THEM BACKED UP ON THEIR
[ct=1764.556] OWN 2 YARD LINE TO START THIS
[ct=1766.515] DRIVE, AND LIKE I SAID, THE
[ct=1770.074] FIRST FIRST DOWN MADE IT A WIN
[ct=1770.645] FOR THE DETROIT OFFENSE BUT
[ct=1772.702] HERE, THEY’RE STILL ROLLING.
[ct=1773.618] >> Joe: GOOD PROTECTION FOR
[ct=1777.120] FLAG ON THE PLAY, AND THE
[ct=1778.613] SECONDARY AND GIBBS IS FORCED
[ct=1778.613] OUT WITH A GAIN OF NINE.
[ct=1783.489] >> Troy: I THINK HENRIETTA IN ME
[ct=1783.489] WAS COMING OUT THERE, JOE.
[ct=1793.038] >> Joe: KITTLE IS ON THAT LIST.
[ct=1794.080] DALLAS CLARK.
[ct=1794.973] >> Referee: DEFENSE NUMBER 14.
[ct=1798.865] TROH NOAH FANT.
[ct=1802.984] >> Joe: GOES ON AND ON AND
[ct=1804.416] CALLED IT AGAINST KYLE HAMILTON,
[ct=1809.264] MR. ALL WORLD FOR THE RAVENS AS
[ct=1810.868] HE WAS WORKING ON --
[ct=1811.859] >> Troy: YOU CAN’T WATCH THE
[ct=1814.044] RAVENS PLAY AND HAVE A
[ct=1815.350] BROADCASTER NOT HIGHLIGHT KYLE
[ct=1816.460] HAMILTON AND ALL THAT HE DOES.
[ct=1818.899] WITH THAT SAID, I STILL DON’T
[ct=1820.940] KNOW IF HE GETS THE CREDIT HE
[ct=1821.990] DESERVES.
[ct=1822.664] HE IS SOME KIND OF FOOTBALL
[ct=1822.944] PLAYER.
[ct=1826.562] >> Joe: FIRST DOWN CARRIED BY
[ct=1827.416] MONTGOMERY AND HE ALMOST BROKE
[ct=1831.365] A GAIN OF EIGHT.
[ct=1832.986] BOY, THEY JUST KEEP COMING AT
[ct=1837.705] YOU BECAUSE THEY CAN ROTATE THE
[ct=1838.077] BACKS AND MONTGOMERY, HE’S NOT
[ct=1839.014] THE SAME BACK AS GIBBS.
[ct=1840.074] THEY’RE DIFFERENT TYPES.
[ct=1841.344] >> Troy: THEY ARE BUT ON THIRD
[ct=1843.311] AND ONE, WHO DID THEY GIVE THE
[ct=1844.406] BALL TO?
[ct=1844.730] JAHMYR GIBBS.
[ct=1845.322] YOU GET LABELED THIS THIS
[ct=1847.498] LEAGUE, AND I GET IT THAT
[ct=1847.738] MONTGOMERY IS MORE OF THE
[ct=1849.526] BETWEEN THE TACKLES PHYSICAL
[ct=1851.489] RUNNER, WHICH HE IS.
[ct=1854.222] BUT JAHMYR GIBBS, HE’S A TOUGH
[ct=1854.222] RUNNER AS WELL.
[ct=1856.388] SO THAT’S A HECK OF A ONE-TWO
[ct=1857.722] PUNCH THAT THEY HAVE, AND IT’S
[ct=1858.931] BEEN NICE TO SEE MONTGOMERY DO
[ct=1860.717] WHAT HE’S DONE SINCE COMING FROM
[ct=1861.074] CHICAGO TO DETROIT.
[ct=1865.028] >> Joe: HAVEN’T CALLED HIS NAME
[ct=1867.133] TONIGHT, ROQUAN SMITH.
[ct=1870.117] HEARD IT A LOT LAST WEEK.
[ct=1872.786] HE HAD AN ALL WORLD GAME AGAINST
[ct=1873.114] THE BROWNS.
[ct=1874.542] HERE IS MONTGOMERY GETTING TEN
[ct=1874.889] AGAIN.
[ct=1879.879] GIBBS AND MONTGOMERY HAVE DONE
[ct=1884.393] SPECIAL THINGS SINCE 2023, AND
[ct=1886.047] THEIR COMBINED RUSH TDs, THE
[ct=1889.024] MOST BY ANY TEAMMATES ACROSS THE
[ct=1892.595] NFL, GIBBS HAS A TOUCHDOWN
[ct=1894.035] AND THEY ARE EASILY THE BEST DUO
[ct=1895.579] AROUND THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL
[ct=1897.398] LEAGUE, EACH HAS HAD OVER A
[ct=1899.432] THOUSAND SCRIMMAGE YARDS AND TEN
[ct=1901.699] PLUS TOUCHDOWNS EACH OF THE LAST
[ct=1903.201] TWO YEARS AND THEY’RE THE FIRST
[ct=1903.830] DUO THAT CAN SAY THAT IN NFL
[ct=1904.399] HISTORY.
[ct=1908.911] FIRST DOWN, LIONS.
[ct=1912.904] INSIDE THE 20.
[ct=1912.904] HERE’S GIBBS.
[ct=1916.074] TRYING TO GET TO THE EDGE AND
[ct=1917.824] THEY’VE DONE A NICE JOB ON GIBBS
[ct=1918.571] SO FAR.
[ct=1921.992] MIKE GREEN, WHO IS GOING TO GET
[ct=1924.137] MORE WORK WITH THE INJURY TO VAN
[ct=1925.427] NOY JUST A GAIN OF ONE.
[ct=1926.714] >> Troy: WE TALKED ABOUT THESE
[ct=1928.085] TWO YOUNG GUARDS, AND THE
[ct=1930.399] STRUGGLES THEY HAD WEEK ONE, AND
[ct=1932.798] THIS PLAY HERE, YOU SEE
[ct=1934.778] MAHOGANY, HE LEADS UP ON THE
[ct=1935.714] DOUBLE TEAM, GETS THE SECOND
[ct=1939.256] LEVEL, SEALS OFF ROQUAN SMITH,
[ct=1939.256] TATE RATLEDGE, HE DID JUST AS
[ct=1941.167] WELL ON THE OTHER SIDE, AND
[ct=1942.693] THOSE GUYS ARE SETTLED IN AND I
[ct=1945.641] KNOW THAT WAS A REAL KEY FOR
[ct=1946.575] JOHNNIE MORTON COMING IN, TRYING
[ct=1948.170] TO LET THEM SETTLE IN AND I
[ct=1952.032] BELIEVE THEY HAVE.
[ct=1954.745] >> Joe: GIBBS, PICKING HIS WAY
[ct=1956.241] AND A YARD, YARD AND A HALF
[ct=1958.539] SHORT OF A FIRST DOWN AS MALAKI
[ct=1959.421] STARKS, THE ROOKIE, MADE THE
[ct=1961.781] STOP.
[ct=1963.345] >> Troy: WELL, AGAIN, ANOTHER
[ct=1965.536] LOOK WITH YUTO TOTSUKA AND
[ct=1966.967] GRAHAM GLASGOW UP FRONT THIS
[ct=1967.987] DOUBLE TEAM BETWEEN THE CENTER
[ct=1969.871] AND GUARD, THEY WORK TO THE
[ct=1971.746] THREE TECHNIQUE AND THEN AS THEY
[ct=1974.503] MOVE UP, THEY GET TO THE
[ct=1975.181] LINEBACKER LEVEL, AND IT’S JUST
[ct=1976.360] AN OUTSTANDING JOB.
[ct=1978.068] THESE GUYS ARE -- I MEAN, THIS
[ct=1978.902] IS A TOUGH FRONT.
[ct=1981.210] NOW, YOU MENTIONED IT, JOE,
[ct=1982.661] WITHOUT MADUBUIKE AND YOU CAN’T
[ct=1983.572] OVERSTATE HOW BIG OF A LOSS THAT
[ct=1987.890] IS FOR THIS RAVENS GROUP.
[ct=1990.716] >> Joe: THIRD DOWN AND ONE.
[ct=1996.632] ST. BROWN IN THE BACKFIELD AND
[ct=1998.507] GOFF JUST TAKES IT AND GETS IT.
[ct=2004.926] I MEAN THIS, IS GOING TO BE A
[ct=2005.963] NINE-PLUS-MINUTE DRIVE, AND A
[ct=2009.105] DRIVE THAT STARTED INSIDE THEIR
[ct=2011.514] OWN 2 AND NOW THEY’VE GOT A
[ct=2012.960] FIRST AND GOAL WITH THE BALL
[ct=2013.773] SITTING AT THE 9.
[ct=2015.820] >> Troy: YEAH, THIS IS THE
[ct=2019.238] SIGNATURE DRIVE OF THE THREE
[ct=2019.238] GAMES.
[ct=2020.991] WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT, THERE’S
[ct=2022.804] NOTHING THAT FEELS BETTER.
[ct=2025.258] THERE’S NNAMDI MADUBUIKE, WHO IS
[ct=2027.337] NOT IN UNIFORM TONIGHT, NOT SURE
[ct=2028.941] EXACTLY WHEN HE MIGHT BE BACK,
[ct=2030.792] BUT WHAT A BIG LOSS THAT IS FOR
[ct=2033.233] THIS RAVENS DEFENSE.
[ct=2033.883] >> Joe: YEAH, THEY’RE KIND OF
[ct=2034.557] CONCERNED ABOUT THAT NECK
[ct=2035.383] INJURY.
[ct=2039.778] HERE’S GIBBS, PERFECT THROW, AND
[ct=2041.891] JUST SHORT OF THE END ZONE.
[ct=2043.276] HIS KNEE MAY HAVE BEEN DOWN WHEN
[ct=2044.290] HE GOT TO THE GOAL LINE.
[ct=2046.341] THAT’S THE CALL ON THE FIELD.
[ct=2048.380] AND THEY GOT IT RIGHT.
[ct=2049.712] >> Troy: YEAH, GOOD CALL BY THE
[ct=2050.490] OFFICIALS.
[ct=2051.410] NICE JOB BY JAHMYR GIBBS AS HE
[ct=2052.845] COMES OUT OF THE BACKFIELD.
[ct=2054.284] IT’S A LITTLE QUICK ON THE
[ct=2054.657] ANGLE.
[ct=2056.036] HE DOESN’T QUITE GET STRAIGHT UP
[ct=2057.707] THE FIELD BUT JUST SAW HE HAD
[ct=2059.528] OPEN GRASS AND DOWN THERE TIGHT,
[ct=2061.510] HE WAS GOING TO GIVE GOFF AN
[ct=2062.829] AREA -- A PLACE TO GO WITH THE
[ct=2066.049] FOOTBALL IMMEDIATELY AND THAT’S
[ct=2067.947] THE OTHER PART OF IN THAT JAHMYR
[ct=2067.947] GIBBS GIVES YOU.
[ct=2070.370] I TALKED ABOUT HIS TOUGHNESS
[ct=2070.370] INSIDE.
[ct=2072.248] BUT HIM AS A RECEIVER, JUST
[ct=2074.712] ANOTHER ELEMENT.
[ct=2077.035] >> Joe: MONTGOMERY BACK WITH
[ct=2077.791] GOFF ON SECOND AND GOAL.
[ct=2078.512] MONTGOMERY GETS IT.
[ct=2083.146] AND NO CALL.
[ct=2083.146] THEY’RE SAYING HE’S SHORT.
[ct=2085.314] NOW THE OTHER OFFICIAL SAYS
[ct=2087.656] TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=2090.704] THE NEAR OFFICIAL SAID HE DIDN’T
[ct=2091.020] GET IT.
[ct=2095.947] THE FAR OFFICIAL CAME IN AND
[ct=2096.654] CALLS TOUCHDOWN AND LET’S JUST
[ct=2097.236] MAKE SURE.
[ct=2099.014] WHAT A DRIVE THAT WAS.
[ct=2100.922] AND HE’S IN.
[ct=2107.862] >> Troy: THAT’S AS GOOD AS IT
[ct=2108.661] GETS.
[ct=2109.988] IT’S GOOD NO MATTER WHO YOU’RE
[ct=2111.424] PLAYING BUT WHEN YOU’RE PLAYING
[ct=2113.868] ON THE ROAD AGAINST THIS RAVENS
[ct=2115.986] DEFENSE, 98 YARDS, THAT’S PRETTY
[ct=2116.561] IMPRESSIVE.
[ct=2117.526] THAT’S A GOOD CALL.
[ct=2122.649] YOU SEE THE BALL IN THE LEFT
[ct=2122.935] ARM, AND SAM LaPORTA, HE LEADS
[ct=2125.020] THE WAY THEN YOU GOT ST. BROWN,
[ct=2126.060] HE’S HELPING TRY TO MAKE A BLOCK
[ct=2126.391] AS WELL.
[ct=2131.425] THAT IS ONE GREAT DRIVE.
[ct=2140.500] >> Joe: THEY GO 98 1/2 YARDS AND
[ct=2143.065] A DRIVE THAT TOOK OVER NINE
[ct=2144.149] MINUTES.
[ct=2144.721] >> Referee: PLEASE RESET THE
[ct=2150.558] GAME CLOCK TO 5:55.
[ct=2152.927] >> Joe: IF YOU DON’T WANT LAMAR
[ct=2153.964] TO BEAT YOU HAVE HIM SIT ON THE
[ct=2157.513] >> Troy: WE CAN STOP TALKING
[ct=2159.312] ABOUT THESE TWO YOUNG OFFENSIVE
[ct=2159.944] GUARDS.
[ct=2161.378] GO 98 YARDS AGAINST THE RAVENS
[ct=2163.295] AND RUN THE FOOTBALL THE WAY
[ct=2164.689] THEY DID, THEY’RE SETTLED IN AND
[ct=2166.706] GOOD TO GO.
[ct=2167.505] >> Joe: BATES FOR THE EXTRA
[ct=2167.757] POINT.
[ct=2174.554] SEVEN-POINT LEAD.
[ct=2176.627] I KEEP UNDERSELLING THAT DRIVE.
[ct=2176.964] TEN MINUTES AND 48 SECONDS.
[ct=2177.598] WOW!
[ct=2180.432] A COUPLE OF BIG
[ct=2182.993] TEAMMATES, ALL FOUR GUYS IN THE
[ct=2184.809] HALL OF FAME ARE JAHMYR GIBBS
[ct=2185.119] AND DAVID MONTGOMERY.
[ct=2190.433] ROSTER, JOE, IT’S JUST WHETHER
[ct=2192.291] IT’S THOSE TWO OR OTHER
[ct=2194.389] POSITIONS, I THINK WHAT HOLMES
[ct=2196.482] HAS DONE WITH THE DEPTH ON THIS
[ct=2198.247] FOOTBALL TEAM IS IMPRESSIVE AS
[ct=2198.247] ANYTHING.
[ct=2203.658] >> Joe: HERE IS RASHEEN ALI ABLE
[ct=2205.552] TO BREAK OUT, AND THE KICKER,
[ct=2206.550] BATES, GOT HIM AND BROUGHT HIM
[ct=2209.436] DOWN AND SAVED THE TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=2216.113] THAT WAS A TOUCHDOWN SAVING
[ct=2216.743] TACKLE.
[ct=2217.212] LET’S SEND IT DOWN TO
[ct=2217.572] >> Laura:.
[ct=2219.994] >> Laura: TROY TALKED A LOT
[ct=2223.557] ABOUT THIS OFFENSIVE LINE FOR
[ct=2223.945] THE DETROIT LIONS AND
[ct=2226.353] SPECIFICALLY THE YOUNG GUARDS IN
[ct=2226.977] TATE RATLEDGE AND GRAHAM GLASGOW
[ct=2228.363] OVER ON THE SIDELINE GETTING
[ct=2228.923] OXYGEN.
[ct=2229.912] THEY’RE A LITTLE WINDED AFTER
[ct=2231.574] THAT LONG DRIVE, NINE MINUTES,
[ct=2233.806] OVER NINE MINUTES AND TATE
[ct=2235.163] RATLEDGE WHEN HE CAME TO THE
[ct=2236.645] SIDE, HE’S LIKE, THAT’S ONE OF
[ct=2239.601] THE LONGEST DRIVES I’VE HAD IN
[ct=2239.601] MY LIFE.
[ct=2241.194] HE WAS SHAKING THE SWEAT OUT OF
[ct=2244.275] HIS MULLET.
[ct=2246.014] >> Troy: GET THE GUY SOME
[ct=2246.994] >> Joe: IT’S GOT TO BE.
[ct=2248.666] YOU CAN’T GO MUCH MORE.
[ct=2250.512] IT WAS 98 1/2 YARDS.
[ct=2252.282] I DON’T THINK THE FIELD IS MUCH
[ct=2252.954] LONGER THAN THAT.
[ct=2253.950] >> Troy: YOU CALLED IT.
[ct=2255.498] BIG THIRD DOWN THROW TO START
[ct=2256.963] THE DRIVE GOING WHEN THEY WERE
[ct=2257.552] BACKED UP.
[ct=2259.906] 13 RUNS ON THAT 18-PLAY DRIVE,
[ct=2262.050] AND, YOU KNOW, IT’S NOT THAT
[ct=2263.840] THEY’RE JUST RATTLING OFF A LOT
[ct=2264.518] OF BIG RUNS, BUT THAT’S WHAT
[ct=2265.334] YOU’VE GOT TO DO.
[ct=2268.233] YOU’VE GOT TO STICK WITH IT SO
[ct=2268.818] JOHN MORTON, THE OFFENSIVE
[ct=2270.240] COORDINATOR, REALLY GOOD JOB OF
[ct=2271.621] CONTINUING TO POUND THE
[ct=2273.503] FOOTBALL, MIX IN THE PASSING
[ct=2273.860] GAME, THAT WAS A THING OF
[ct=2274.821] BEAUTY.
[ct=2275.988] >> Joe: SECOND DOWN AND SIX.
[ct=2278.526] WE’LL GIVE YOU THAT TACKLE BY
[ct=2280.963] THE KICKER, JAKE BATES, THAT
[ct=2281.247] SAVED A TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=2285.125] HERE’S JACKSON TAKING OFF, AND
[ct=2285.421] HE IS WRESTLED TO THE GROUND BY
[ct=2287.277] BARNES.
[ct=2289.367] DERRICK BARNES WITH A STRONG
[ct=2291.498] NO GAIN AND HERE’S THE TACKLE BY
[ct=2295.387] THE KICKER, JAKE BATES AND IF IT
[ct=2296.112] WASN’T HIM, IT WAS A KICK RETURN
[ct=2296.438] FOR A TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=2300.385] >> Troy: YEAH, YOU KNOW, HIS
[ct=2301.857] EYES HAD TO BE LIKE SAUCERS,
[ct=2302.907] ONE-ON-ONE AND HE’S THE LAST
[ct=2304.975] LINE OF DEFENSE.
[ct=2305.321] HE DID GOOD.
[ct=2307.058] THAT’S -- HEY, WHATEVER
[ct=2309.574] TAKES.
[ct=2309.574] GET HIM ON THE GROUND.
[ct=2315.983] >> Joe: FORMER BRICK SALESMAN IN
[ct=2315.983] HOUSTON.
[ct=2319.062] >> Troy: I HATE TO SAY WHAT HE
[ct=2320.830] MIGHT HAVE BEEN DOING WITH THEM
[ct=2322.731] BRICKS ON THAT LAST PLAY.
[ct=2323.391] >> Joe: THEM BRICKS.
[ct=2325.010] WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?
[ct=2326.597] JACKSON GETS OUT OF THERE AND
[ct=2327.323] FIRES.
[ct=2327.928] HE’S GOT BATEMAN FOR A FIRST
[ct=2336.133] WHAT A PLAY BY LAMAR JACKSON,
[ct=2337.209] EXTENDING IT, FORCING THESE
[ct=2338.489] COVER GUYS TO STICK ON THEIR
[ct=2340.190] RECEIVERS AND THAT’S GOOD FOR
[ct=2341.915] >> Troy: WELL, THAT’S JUST IT.
[ct=2343.415] HERE THEY COME SO IT’S
[ct=2343.744] MAN-TO-MAN.
[ct=2345.188] THERE’S NOBODY IN THE MIDDLE OF
[ct=2347.659] THE FIELD, AND AS A DEFENDER, I
[ct=2348.230] MEAN, YOU’RE SITTING THERE
[ct=2350.433] GOING, MAN, THE BALL HAS GOT TO
[ct=2352.783] COME OUT AND LAMAR, HE’S ABLE TO
[ct=2353.539] THROW THAT THING PERFECTLY.
[ct=2356.400] >> Joe: WOW.
[ct=2360.635] LAMAR JACKSON HAS THE NUMBER ONE
[ct=2364.889] PASSER RATING OF ALL-TIME.
[ct=2371.238] PLAY ACTION AND NOW THIS IS A
[ct=2375.466] SHOT FOR WALKER SETTING UP FIRST
[ct=2377.601] AND GOAL.
[ct=2384.965] DEVONTEZ WALKER IN HIS SECOND
[ct=2386.186] YEAR GOOD FOR --
[ct=2387.661] >> Troy: YOU’RE PUTTING
[ct=2388.726] CORNELIUSS ON AN ISLAND AND
[ct=2390.739] WALKER WITH HIS SPEED IS COMING
[ct=2393.083] OFF THE BALL AND TERRION ARNOLD,
[ct=2394.074] I MEAN, HE KNOWS WHAT HE’S UP
[ct=2395.235] AGAINST.
[ct=2396.707] HE KNOWS THIS GUY CAN FLAT RUN
[ct=2398.427] BY HIM, AND SO HE WITH THE SPEED
[ct=2399.324] COMING OFF THE LINE OF
[ct=2402.006] SCRIMMAGE, HE GETS ARNOLD TURNED
[ct=2403.414] AROUND.
[ct=2403.414] >> Joe: HERE IS HENRY.
[ct=2404.462] HE IS TO THE 1.
[ct=2412.944] DEVONTEZ WALKER CAME IN TONIGHT
[ct=2414.703] WITH TWO CATCHES FOR TWO
[ct=2416.101] TOUCHDOWNS, THREE CATCHES IN HIS
[ct=2419.545] CAREER FOR THREE TOUCHDOWNS.
[ct=2421.255] FOURTH ROUND PICK FROM NORTH
[ct=2422.217] CAROLINA AND ALMOST GOT NUMBER
[ct=2423.987] FOUR OF HIS CAREER ON THAT ONE.
[ct=2425.565] >> Troy: YEAH, HE’S ALREADY MADE
[ct=2427.096] SOME PLAYS WITH THE COUPLE
[ct=2428.237] TOUCHDOWNS YOU TALK ABOUT AND
[ct=2428.799] HE’S GOING TO BE A SPECIAL
[ct=2432.081] WHEN YOU HAVE A GUY LIKE HIM
[ct=2434.351] WITH THAT KIND OF SPEED THERE’S
[ct=2434.890] SO MUCH YOU GET TO DO WITH HIM.
[ct=2437.940] >> Joe: HENRY, THEY STOPPED HIM.
[ct=2443.351] NO GAIN ON THE PLAY AND YOU SEE
[ct=2445.771] THE FRUSTRATION ON LAMAR
[ct=2446.480] JACKSON’S FACE AND IT’S THIRD
[ct=2450.656] >> Troy: WELL, THEY’RE TRYING TO
[ct=2451.675] GO UP TEMPO.
[ct=2454.845] WHEN THEY’VE HAD THE BIG PLAY,
[ct=2455.556] THEY DID IT ON THEIR OPENING
[ct=2456.352] DRIVE POSSESSION FOR A TOUCHDOWN
[ct=2457.324] AND GOTTEN TO THE LINE QUICKLY.
[ct=2459.139] SOMETIMES THAT’S GOOD AND
[ct=2461.617] SOMETIMES WHEN YOU RUSH, YOU GET
[ct=2463.825] THE OFFENSIVE LINEMEN NOT QUITE
[ct=2465.871] DUG IN READY FOR THE BALL TO BE
[ct=2470.440] SNAPPED, ND THEY DON’T COME OFF
[ct=2471.526] IN SEQUENCE.
[ct=2472.225] >> Joe: THAT WILL TAKE US TO
[ct=2474.674] TWO-MINUTE WARNING.
[ct=2475.340] A LITTLE FRUSTRATION FOR THE
[ct=2476.771] RAVENS AS THEY GET DOWN THERE,
[ct=2477.832] BUT NOW WILL FACE A THIRD AND
[ct=2481.551] GOAL FROM THE 1. FRESH ALL
[ct=2482.541] DAY LONG. I WANTED SOMETHING
[ct=2485.203] THAT WORKS AND MANDO WORKS.
[ct=2488.371] >> DID YOU SAY IT’S A COPYCAT
[ct=2489.591] LEAGUE? IT’S BEEN A COPYCAT
[ct=2491.605] GAME. THE LIONS GOT A TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=2492.656] THE RAVENS ANSWERED. THE LIONS
[ct=2495.485] WENT THREE AND OUT. THE RAVENS
[ct=2496.394] WENT THREE AND OUT. THE LIONS
[ct=2498.200] JUST GOT A TOUCHDOWN. AND
[ct=2498.571] HERE’S A THIRD AND GOAL FROM
[ct=2501.937] THE ONE FOR THE RAVENS TRYING
[ct=2502.377] TO TIE THE GAME.
[ct=2506.613] >> THEY GOT TWO DOWNS TO DO IT.
[ct=2509.306] >> A LOT CAN HAPPEN THE REST OF
[ct=2511.472] THE WAY. TWO MINUTES LEFT EACH
[ct=2513.232] SIDE WITH ALL THREE TIMEOUTS
[ct=2517.236] REMAINING. AS THE RAVENS HURRY
[ct=2521.760] TO THE LINE. JUSTIN HENRY. HE
[ct=2526.027] DOESN’T GET IT. CUNNINGHAM WAS
[ct=2528.132] IN THERE ON THE STOP. AND IT’S
[ct=2529.847] FOURTH DOWN AND GOAL. THE
[ct=2534.193] OFFENSE WILL STAY OUT THERE FOR
[ct=2534.193] JOHN HARBAUGH.
[ct=2538.972] >> WOW. THAT’S SUCH A GREAT JOB
[ct=2541.165] BY ZACH CUNNINGHAM. JUST
[ct=2542.134] FILLING IT AND NOT GIVING
[ct=2545.366] DERRICK HENRY AN OPPORTUNITY.
[ct=2547.512] >> A HURRY AGAIN TO THE LINE.
[ct=2549.602] LOSS OF ONE ON THAT PLAY.
[ct=2554.050] FOURTH AND GOAL LAMAR KEEPS AND
[ct=2556.147] IS IN TROUBLE. BALL’S OUT. AND
[ct=2558.215] IT’S DETROIT’S BALL. JACK
[ct=2562.532] CAMPBELL MADE THAT PLAY. AND
[ct=2564.897] WHAT A JOB BY KELVIN SHEPHERD’S
[ct=2568.944] LIONS DEFENSE BATES SAVED THE
[ct=2571.267] TOUCHDOWN ON THE KICK RETURN
[ct=2573.131] KELVIN SHEPHERD’S FIRED UP.
[ct=2579.494] WHAT A JOB. JACKSON LOOKING TO
[ct=2583.140] THROW CAMPBELL KNOCKED IT OUT. H
[ct=2585.898] FEAR. JUST FOX. SAY, SHOW ME A
[ct=2587.963] CARMAX.COM.
[ct=2589.709] >> I MENTIONED HOW FAST THE
[ct=2591.102] RAVENS WERE BREAKING THE HUDDLE
[ct=2594.405] TO GET TO THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE.
[ct=2594.405] THEY THOUGHT THEY WOULD GIVE
[ct=2596.216] HIM AN ADVANTAGE, BUT YOU SEE
[ct=2597.426] HOW QUICKLY THE LIONS GET LINED
[ct=2599.769] UP. THEY DID THAT ON THIRD DOWN.
[ct=2600.732] THEY DID IT ON FOURTH DOWN.
[ct=2602.868] THEY’VE DONE IT A FEW TIMES
[ct=2604.997] EARLIER IN THIS BALL GAME. BUT
[ct=2604.997] THE LIONS JUST SHOWED
[ct=2606.114] TREMENDOUS DISCIPLINE OF BEING
[ct=2606.463] PREPARED AND THEN EXECUTING.
[ct=2609.235] AND ON THAT ONE LAMAR JACKSON
[ct=2611.387] HE HAD NO OPPORTUNITY. THERE
[ct=2612.778] WAS NOBODY OPEN NO SEPARATION.
[ct=2614.056] AND THEN THERE’S THE GAME
[ct=2617.783] SAVING OR EXCUSE ME, THE
[ct=2617.783] TOUCHDOWN SAVING TACKLE BY
[ct=2620.510] BATES. AWFULLY GOOD JOB BY
[ct=2622.012] EVERYBODY. SPECIAL TEAMS
[ct=2624.128] DEFENSE REALLY GOOD STUFF. NOT
[ct=2624.423] ONLY.
[ct=2626.539] >> DID THE RAVENS NOT SCORE,
[ct=2628.347] BUT THEY LOST 18 YARDS ON THAT
[ct=2632.133] FUMBLE BY LAMAR JACKSON. AND
[ct=2633.471] THE BALL IS AT THE 20. WHAT A
[ct=2635.500] PLAY BY JACK CAMPBELL. GOFF
[ct=2639.815] SPINS OUT. CANNOT CONNECT WITH
[ct=2642.510] >> YEAH JACK CAMPBELL I AGREE
[ct=2644.646] JOE. SUCH A GOOD PLAY BY HIM IN
[ct=2645.465] HIS THIRD YEAR
[ct=2648.320] PLAYER IOWA.
[ct=2650.371] >> DEFENSE NUMBER 44 FIVE-YARD
[ct=2651.446] PENALTY AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN.
[ct=2652.491] >> THAT’S A PENALTY ON
[ct=2654.697] HUMPHREY. SO THAT’S GOING TO
[ct=2656.746] GIVE THE LIONS ANOTHER SET OF
[ct=2658.647] DOWNS. BUT YEAH THIS DEFENSE
[ct=2660.584] YOU KNOW WE TALK A LOT ABOUT
[ct=2662.432] THE LOSS OF BEN JOHNSON ON THE
[ct=2663.209] OFFENSE. BUT THEN AARON GLENN
[ct=2666.072] GOES TO THE NEW YORK JETS AS A
[ct=2666.378] HEAD COACH KELVIN SHEPPARD WHAT
[ct=2668.293] AN IMPRESSIVE GUY HE IS. AS WE
[ct=2670.382] TAKE A LOOK AT THAT PENALTY ON
[ct=2672.839] HUMPHREY. BUT HE’S GOT THIS
[ct=2673.669] GROUP PLAYING PRETTY GOOD
[ct=2683.913] >> ON FIRST DOWN. GOFF. OUT TO
[ct=2686.204] HIS LEFT JUST THROWS IT AWAY.
[ct=2688.412] MINUTE 12 LEFT. THREE TIMEOUTS
[ct=2691.210] FOR DETROIT. TONIGHT’S TOTAL
[ct=2692.447] REPLAY IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY
[ct=2696.273] CHICK-FIL-A. DAVID MONTGOMERY.
[ct=2699.068] THIS COMBINATION AND THE JOB UP
[ct=2700.457] FRONT BY THOSE YOUNG GUARDS
[ct=2702.666] YEAH.
[ct=2704.485] >> AS I MENTIONED YOU TRY TO
[ct=2706.868] GET THEM SETTLED IN AS BEST YOU
[ct=2708.058] CAN. PART OF THAT IS NOT MAKING
[ct=2709.003] THEM HOLD THEIR STANCE TOO LONG,
[ct=2711.173] LETTING THEM COME OFF THE BALL.
[ct=2713.192] SOME OF THE CALLS AND THE RUNS
[ct=2714.304] AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE. BUT
[ct=2715.485] YOU WANT TO GET A PRETTY GOOD
[ct=2717.874] TANDEM BETWEEN THOSE TWO GUYS.
[ct=2720.027] AND THE STRENGTH HAS ALWAYS
[ct=2721.467] BEEN THIS OFFENSIVE LINE. THE
[ct=2724.277] OFFENSE IN GENERAL RUNS THROUGH
[ct=2724.551] HIM WHEN THEY’RE DOING THEIR
[ct=2726.453] JOB, EVERYTHING ELSE FLOWS.
[ct=2727.654] QUICK THROW.
[ct=2730.673] >> BLITZ WAS ON AND ODAFE OWEH
[ct=2732.782] GOT THROUGH. IT’S A FORWARD
[ct=2734.471] PASS. THEY’RE LETTING IT PLAY
[ct=2739.127] ON. AND THE OFFICIALS ARE
[ct=2740.089] LOOKING AT EACH OTHER. THEY’RE
[ct=2741.385] TOLD TO LET IT PLAY. BUT THAT
[ct=2743.771] SURE LOOKED LIKE A FORWARD PASS.
[ct=2745.226] >> IF THAT’S NOT THEN I DON’T
[ct=2748.023] KNOW WHAT A FORWARD PASS IS.
[ct=2750.105] >> THIS ONE WILL DEFINITELY BE
[ct=2750.383] A FORWARD PASS. WE’LL BRING
[ct=2752.300] THIS ONE BACK.
[ct=2752.610] >> AFTER REPLAY. SAYS IT’S AN
[ct=2754.801] INCOMPLETE PASS. THIRD DOWN.
[ct=2762.191] >> AND AWAY WITH A HIT ON GOFF.
[ct=2764.999] THEY BROUGHT ROQUAN SMITH ON A
[ct=2767.129] BLITZ. AND THAT OFFENSIVE LINE
[ct=2768.774] WE WERE JUST RAVING ABOUT. HAD
[ct=2770.667] A TOUGH TIME PICKING IT UP.
[ct=2771.138] THEY DID.
[ct=2772.529] >> THEY SHOWED BLITZ. AND SO
[ct=2775.260] TAYLOR DECKER HE BLOCKED DOWN
[ct=2778.388] AND IT GAVE A FREE RUN. THEN ON
[ct=2780.312] GOFF. AND YOU CAN MAKE THE
[ct=2782.347] ARGUMENT RUSSELL THAT THAT WAS
[ct=2783.323] HELMET TO HELMET. IT WAS CLOSE
[ct=2784.494] TO.
[ct=2786.694] >> HELMET TO HELMET. BUT HE
[ct=2786.694] STAYED A LITTLE LOW. I’M NOT
[ct=2788.753] SURPRISED THEY DIDN’T CALL IT
[ct=2790.084] THIRD DOWN AND TEN WITH THE
[ct=2793.007] BALL SITTING AT THE 25. AMANRA
[ct=2795.449] SAINT BROWN WELL PLAYED BY THE
[ct=2797.559] RAVENS AND THE LIONS DO NOTHING
[ct=2799.656] WITH THE BALL. NATE WIGGINS
[ct=2804.123] MADE THAT STOP. AND THE CLOCK
[ct=2805.969] WILL STOP TOUCHDOWNS THIS WEEK,
[ct=2810.563] MOST IN FIVE YEARS. ALMOST HAD
[ct=2812.631] ONE TONIGHT, IF NOT FOR JAKE
[ct=2814.774] BATES AS JACK FOX WILL PUNT IT.
[ct=2819.080] WEBSTER WAITING FOR IT. FLAG IS
[ct=2822.954] DOWN. WEBSTER ON THE RETURN AND
[ct=2825.416] HE GETS DROPPED AFTER HE
[ct=2827.519] CROSSED THE 40.
[ct=2833.940] >> HOLDING TEAM NUMBER 15. THE
[ct=2835.989] TEN YARD PENALTY WILL BE ADDED
[ct=2837.297] AT THE END OF THE RUN. FIRST
[ct=2838.380] DOWN. TIME OUT.
[ct=2842.451] >> AGAIN. GRANT STEWART WITH A
[ct=2844.952] HOLD AND IT’LL BE GREAT. FIELD
[ct=2847.030] POSITION FOR THE RAVENS.OCKET
[ct=2848.732] MORTGAGE, OFFICIAL MORTGAGE
[ct=2851.449] PROVIDER OF THE NFL.
[ct=2853.619] >> GIVE YOU A LOOK AT THE HOLD
[ct=2858.177] BY STEWARD AS HE GRABBED JAKE
[ct=2860.145] HUMMEL, WHO WAS COMING THROUGH.
[ct=2861.438] HUMMEL BLOCKED A PUNT AGAINST
[ct=2862.055] THE BROWNS LAST WEEK.
[ct=2865.001] >> YEAH, I THINK HE WOULD HAVE
[ct=2865.282] HAD A SECOND ONE TONIGHT. IF
[ct=2866.961] STEWART DOESN’T COME OVER AND
[ct=2869.383] AND TACKLE HIM. ALTHOUGH
[ct=2871.513] RUSSELL YORK DOESN’T SEEM TO
[ct=2874.010] THINK HE DID ANYTHING WRONG. HE
[ct=2875.859] DOES NOT.
[ct=2877.594] >> AFTER THE RETURN OF THE
[ct=2880.143] PENALTY, THE PUNT NETS JUST 24
[ct=2884.365] YARDS. SO STARTING IN LIONS
[ct=2885.538] TERRITORY JACKSON THERE HE GOES.
[ct=2888.611] FIRST DOWN AND OUT OF BOUNDS.
[ct=2890.842] TWO TIMEOUTS LEFT 48 SECONDS ON
[ct=2894.388] THE CLOCK AND A FIRST DOWN. THE
[ct=2895.430] RAVENS WHO CAME UP EMPTY THE
[ct=2897.537] LAST TIME THEY WERE DOWN CLOSE.
[ct=2899.636] >> WELL JUST TAKE A LOOK.
[ct=2900.942] EVERYBODY’S IN MAN COVERAGE. SO
[ct=2901.301] THEY HAVE THEIR BACK TO THE
[ct=2902.387] QUARTERBACK. AND THAT’S YOU
[ct=2904.217] KNOW THAT’S THE WEAKNESS OF A
[ct=2906.267] MAN COVERAGE DEFENSE. AND WHEN
[ct=2907.953] YOU’RE FACING LAMAR JACKSON IT
[ct=2908.412] DOESN’T EVEN MATTER IF YOU HAVE
[ct=2911.149] A SPY ON HIM WHICH THEY DON’T.
[ct=2912.917] YEAH HE’S NOT GOING TO BE AS
[ct=2915.460] FAST AS LAMAR IS. SO YOU KNOW
[ct=2916.594] KELVIN SHEPPARD HE’S STICKING
[ct=2917.195] TO KIND OF WITH THEIR DNA
[ct=2919.672] THAT IS PLAY PHYSICAL MAN
[ct=2921.562] COVERAGE. BUT LAMAR JACKSON
[ct=2923.323] ABLE TO GET A NICE PLAY
[ct=2928.156] >> JACKSON DUCKING AROUND IN
[ct=2930.986] THE POCKET. AND NOW OUT TO HIS
[ct=2932.405] RIGHT. HE FINDS HIS RUNNING
[ct=2936.804] BACK JUSTICE HILL. AND HILL
[ct=2938.015] WITH A NICE GAIN AS LAMAR
[ct=2940.116] JACKSON. HE CAN EXTEND A PLAY
[ct=2941.886] BETTER THAN ANYBODY IN THE NFL.
[ct=2943.933] THAT WAS A GAIN OF FOUR.
[ct=2946.201] >> YEAH. AND IT’S JUST IT’S
[ct=2948.365] JUST HOLD ON. IF YOU’RE BACK
[ct=2950.552] THERE IN THE SECONDARY AND YOU
[ct=2950.552] KNOW THAT’S THE CHALLENGE FOR
[ct=2952.941] KELVIN SHEPPARD. AGAIN FIRST
[ct=2954.730] TIME DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR.
[ct=2956.563] VERY IMPRESSIVE GUY. AND
[ct=2958.966] VISITING WITH HIM. HE’S BEEN
[ct=2959.313] WITH THE ORGANIZATION FOR THE
[ct=2961.117] LAST SEVERAL YEARS WITH DAN
[ct=2961.399] CAMPBELL. HE LEARNED UNDER
[ct=2963.018] AARON GLENN. SAYS STEVE
[ct=2965.370] SPAGNUOLO IS THE GUY WHO’S
[ct=2967.493] INFLUENCED HIM THE MOST. BUT
[ct=2969.669] WHETHER IT’S HIM OR AARON GLENN,
[ct=2971.767] HE LEARNED FROM TWO AGGRESSIVE
[ct=2972.450] DEFENSIVE COACHES.
[ct=2975.312] >> SECOND DOWN AND SIX.
[ct=2980.274] SIDELINE. HOPKINS. CATCH IS
[ct=2985.703] MADE. AND A 13 YARD COMPLETION
[ct=2988.945] >> HE DOES SUCH A GREAT JOB.
[ct=2990.984] ONCE HE GETS TO THE SIDELINES
[ct=2993.112] HE JUST STOOD THERE. YOU KNOW A
[ct=2993.769] LOT OF LOT OF YOUNGER RECEIVERS
[ct=2995.699] WILL TAKE OFF RUNNING AND NOT
[ct=2997.358] KNOWING EXACTLY WHAT THEIR
[ct=2999.127] QUARTERBACK MIGHT BE THINKING,
[ct=3000.429] HOPKINS GOT OVER TO THE
[ct=3001.891] SIDELINES. HE JUST STOPPED AND
[ct=3004.076] THEN WAITED FOR LAMAR TO FIND
[ct=3006.402] HIM AND MADE WHAT IS PRETTY
[ct=3010.269] ROUTINE FOR HIM. DC YEAH.
[ct=3014.759] >> THEY’RE SHORT. HE’S SHORT.
[ct=3021.118] >> JACKSON. END ZONE. A LOT OF
[ct=3023.533] CONTACT AND A FLAG. HOPKINS AND
[ct=3029.776] TERRION ARNOLD. AND
[ct=3031.844] AGAINST ARNOLD. YEAH.
[ct=3034.046] >> I’D LIKE TO TAKE A LOOK AND
[ct=3034.046] SEE.
[ct=3035.333] >> PASS INTERFERENCE. DEFENSE
[ct=3036.424] NUMBER SIX. FIVE. FOUL.
[ct=3040.119] AUTOMATIC. FIRST DOWN.
[ct=3041.424] >> THERE WAS NO QUESTION. WHERE?
[ct=3044.581] LAMAR. THERE’S THE GRAB. I
[ct=3046.121] THINK IT’S A GOOD CALL. THERE
[ct=3046.121] WAS NO QUESTION WHERE LAMAR WAS
[ct=3047.609] GOING WITH THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=3049.215] HOPKINS WAS OUT THERE ONE ON
[ct=3053.128] ONE. NOW IT WAS A LINE DRIVE.
[ct=3054.833] HE COULD HAVE LAID IT UP AND
[ct=3056.019] MAYBE GIVEN HIM MORE OF AN
[ct=3057.306] OPPORTUNITY. BUT, YOU KNOW,
[ct=3061.915] THERE’S A LOOK AT THE DEFENSIVE
[ct=3062.909] PASS INTERFERENCE THAT HE HAD
[ct=3064.476] LAST YEAR. IT’S BEEN A TOUGH
[ct=3066.115] START THIS YEAR AS WELL. BUT
[ct=3067.455] THE RAVENS HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY
[ct=3070.360] HERE WITH 27 SECONDS TO SCORE.
[ct=3071.033] THEY GET THE BALL AGAIN TO
[ct=3072.390] START THE SECOND HALF. SO THEY
[ct=3073.645] GET A THEY GET A CHANCE TO
[ct=3074.774] DOUBLE UP.
[ct=3079.268] >> IT’S FIRST DOWN AND GOAL.
[ct=3083.234] >> FIRST AND GOAL. THEY GOT A
[ct=3083.876] COUPLE TIME-OUTS BALTIMORE DOES.
[ct=3087.498] SO THEY THEY GOT THE WHOLE
[ct=3087.498] PLAYBOOK.
[ct=3091.574] >> PLAY ACTION AND TOUCHDOWN
[ct=3093.641] RAVENS BATEMAN.
[ct=3104.742] >> GETS UP.
[ct=3107.344] >> LOOKED LIKE THAT PLAY WAS
[ct=3109.156] GOING TO THE RIGHT. AND LAMAR
[ct=3111.193] JACKSON THREW BACK TO HIS LEFT.
[ct=3112.324] >> YEAH IT WAS TOTALLY DESIGNED.
[ct=3114.282] JOE YOU’RE EXACTLY RIGHT THAT
[ct=3116.418] LAMAR JACKSON IS GOING TO SHOW.
[ct=3117.274] LIKE HE’S GOING TO SPRINT OUT
[ct=3118.968] TO HIS RIGHT. AND THEN RASHOD
[ct=3120.391] BATEMAN IS GOING TO COME HERE
[ct=3122.591] AND THEN BACK OUT. SO THE WHOLE
[ct=3124.412] THING WAS DESIGNED WITH ZAY
[ct=3126.338] FLOWERS THEN IN BEHIND THAT.
[ct=3127.538] BUT A GOOD CALL. GET THE
[ct=3129.295] DEFENSE FLOWING. COME BACK TO
[ct=3131.188] BATEMAN FOR THE TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=3132.242] >> DERRICK HENRY WITH A NICE
[ct=3135.355] BLOCK ON AIDAN HUTCHINSON TO
[ct=3136.653] FREE UP LAMAR JACKSON FOR THE
[ct=3139.813] THREE YARD TOUCHDOWN PASS. AND
[ct=3142.963] WE’RE TIED. RAVENS TAKE
[ct=3146.152] ADVANTAGE OF THE SHORT FIELD.
[ct=3148.270] THEY STARTED AT THE LIONS 49.
[ct=3150.186] AND THEY GO 49 YARDS IN 32
[ct=3154.639] >> THIS IS A HECK OF A BALL
[ct=3159.415] >> HALFTIME COMING UP JASON
[ct=3161.593] KELCE. HOPEFULLY HE GOT HIS
[ct=3163.627] WIND BACK.
[ct=3166.521] >> THAT’S A THAT’S A CHIN STRAP.
[ct=3167.906] IT’S NOT A NO STRAP.
[ct=3180.724] >> HOW IS HE BREATHING. JASON
[ct=3182.717] YOU CAN SAY NO.
[ct=3184.944] >> YEAH. SOMETIMES YOU GOT TO
[ct=3186.651] REMIND GUYS YOU KNOW.
[ct=3189.114] >> GOOD FOR HIM. THEY’RE
[ct=3189.400] LOOKING FOR HIM. THEY’RE
[ct=3191.852] MISSING. I DON’T KNOW WHAT KIND
[ct=3193.013] OF SACKS THAT WAS. SOMEBODY LET
[ct=3195.356] THE INTERNET TELL. ME A CROWD
[ct=3198.341] SOURCE FOR WHAT THAT WAS
[ct=3202.240] STANFORD. STEVE. THOSE TWO JUST
[ct=3204.750] CHOPPING IT UP DOWN THERE.
[ct=3205.072] >> CHOPPING IT UP? YEAH, JUST
[ct=3205.489] TALKING BALL.
[ct=3208.548] >> TALKING BALL.
[ct=3208.906] >> LIKE HE DID ON THE PORCH.
[ct=3209.442] AND.
[ct=3209.833] >> HENRIETTA.
[ct=3215.160] >> LIONS DO HAVE THREE TIMEOUTS.
[ct=3217.600] IF DANGEROUS. DAN CAMPBELL
[ct=3220.402] WANTS TO GET FRISKY HERE AT THE
[ct=3222.171] END OF THE HALF.
[ct=3225.522] >> YEAH, THAT’LL. LET’S SEE
[ct=3228.511] WHAT THIS RETURN MIGHT LOOK
[ct=3228.511] LIKE. RAYMOND.
[ct=3233.445] >> KELLY TRIPPED UP AFTER
[ct=3237.035] CROSSING THE 30. AND NOW
[ct=3239.142] THERE’S 18 SECONDS LEFT. MONDAY
[ct=3240.078] NIGHT LIGHTS. THESE TWO GUYS
[ct=3242.838] LOVE PLAYING ON MONDAY NIGHTS.
[ct=3243.978] THEY’RE THEIR CAREER NUMBERS.
[ct=3248.261] EACH GUY, SEVEN AND TWO. HERE
[ct=3250.142] ARE THE NUMBERS TONIGHT. I MEAN,
[ct=3254.357] IDENTICAL RECORDS COMING IN AND
[ct=3256.501] IDENTICAL TOTAL YARDS FOR THE
[ct=3258.655] TWO STARTING QUARTERBACKS HERE
[ct=3258.655] IN WEEK THREE.
[ct=3260.421] >> YEAH. BOTH THESE
[ct=3261.494] QUARTERBACKS TONIGHT HAVE HAD
[ct=3263.354] EXCELLENT FIRST HALVES.
[ct=3266.345] >> THEY ONLY HAD FOUR TOTAL
[ct=3268.316] INCOMPLETE PASSES BETWEEN THE
[ct=3281.004] TWO QUARTERBACKS. GOFF. HE JUST
[ct=3283.459] RETURNED THAT KICK FOR RAYMOND
[ct=3289.594] A GAIN OF FOUR. AND A TIMEOUT
[ct=3293.731] IS TAKEN BY DETROIT. SO DAN
[ct=3295.904] CAMPBELL IS PUTTING THE PEDAL
[ct=3296.478] DOWN AS WE WELCOME YOU INSIDE
[ct=3298.024] THE BROADCAST BOOTH
[ct=3300.124] AND THE NEW HENRIETTA AIKMAN
[ct=3303.120] OVER HERE TO MY RIGHT. THIS. WE
[ct=3306.514] THOUGH THIS WOULD BE A GOOD
[ct=3306.514] GAME COMING IN AND IT HAS NOT
[ct=3308.722] DISAPPOINTED AT ALL. BOTH TEAMS
[ct=3309.333] REALLY IMPRESSIVE TONIGHT.
[ct=3311.486] >> YEAH THEY THEY’VE BEEN GOOD.
[ct=3313.018] BUT IT DID REMIND ME ONE YEAR I
[ct=3315.170] THOUGHT THE SUPER BOWL WAS
[ct=3316.869] GOING TO BE PLAYED IN HENRY.
[ct=3317.455] BUT THAT’S A WHOLE NOTHER STORY.
[ct=3319.860] SO THIS FIRST HALF HAS LIVED UP
[ct=3320.885] TO WHAT WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE
[ct=3322.183] COMING INTO THIS GAME. IT’S A
[ct=3324.537] BIG GAME FOR BOTH THESE TEAMS.
[ct=3326.650] WE TALKED ABOUT IT BEING A
[ct=3326.915] MEASURING STICK AND AND IN A
[ct=3328.569] LOT OF WAYS IT IS, ALTHOUGH
[ct=3330.987] THEY’VE SHOWN ME ENOUGH THAT AS
[ct=3331.614] LONG AS THESE GUYS CAN STAY
[ct=3333.211] HEALTHY, LIKE THE LAST SEVERAL
[ct=3335.266] OTHER YEARS, THEY’RE GOING TO
[ct=3335.266] BE RIGHT THERE WHEN IT’S
[ct=3337.370] SAID AND DONE.
[ct=3341.632] BACKPEDALING AMANRA SAINT BROWN
[ct=3343.792] MAKES THE CATCH AND BOY IS HE
[ct=3346.159] SWARMED BY THE SECONDARY OF THE
[ct=3350.375] RAVENS. T.J. TAMPA, WHO’S A
[ct=3350.662] YOUNG CORNER. THEY LIKE THEY’RE
[ct=3352.513] PLAYING AGAIN WITHOUT JAIRE
[ct=3354.961] ALEXANDER, WHO THEY SIGNED
[ct=3356.997] AFTER MANY YEARS IN GREEN BAY.
[ct=3359.143] AND THEY FIGURED THAT AFTER
[ct=3361.307] KNEE SURGERY AND THEN MISSING A
[ct=3363.397] FEW WEEKS, HE MISSED THREE IN
[ct=3364.805] AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER. HE JUST
[ct=3365.310] WASN’T READY. THEY HOPE NEXT
[ct=3367.656] WEEK WHEN THEY HAVE A DATE WITH
[ct=3369.539] THE KANSAS CITY CHIEFS, THEY’LL
[ct=3369.539] BE READY TO
[ct=3371.417] SUNDAY.
[ct=3373.553] >> WELL, MARLON HUMPHREY
[ct=3375.097] TALKING ABOUT GUYS BEING A
[ct=3375.097] LITTLE BANGED UP ON THAT LAST
[ct=3377.789] PLAY. HE GOT UP AND HE CAME
[ct=3379.888] INTO THE GAME WITH A WITH A
[ct=3380.564] GROIN. HE WAS QUESTIONABLE
[ct=3382.144] THROUGHOUT THE WEEK WITH A
[ct=3384.566] GROIN INJURY. I’M NOT SURE IF
[ct=3385.395] THAT WAS MAYBE RE-AGGRAVATED OR
[ct=3388.514] A KNEE OR AN ANKLE OR SOMETHING.
[ct=3391.273] BUT THEY TOOK HIM OUT SEVEN.
[ct=3393.096] >> SECONDS LEFT. IT’S THIRD.
[ct=3393.762] >> DOWN AND THREE.
[ct=3397.023] >> WITH ONE TIMEOUT. AND NOW
[ct=3399.504] DEFENSIVELY THE RAVENS TAKE A
[ct=3405.553] TIMEOUT. ESPN APP
[ct=3407.331] TO WATCH ALL THE ACTION.
[ct=3409.783] >> YOU KNOW JOE LOOKING AT THIS
[ct=3410.413] RIGHT HERE I KNOW THERE’S SEVEN
[ct=3411.319] SECONDS. THEY’RE BATTLING THAT
[ct=3413.439] THEY NEED ABOUT 20 YARDS. AND
[ct=3416.153] THEN THEY’RE AT JAKE BATES’S
[ct=3417.770] CAREER LONG WHICH WOULD BE A 58
[ct=3420.537] YARDER. SO IT’S NOT
[ct=3420.807] INCONCEIVABLE. YOU KNOW THEY
[ct=3422.730] GOT TO GET THE BALL OUT. GUY’S
[ct=3424.150] GOT TO KNOW THAT IF THEY CATCH
[ct=3426.883] THE BALL AND THEY’RE IN THAT
[ct=3429.048] RANGE, GET DOWN. FULL TIMEOUT.
[ct=3433.089] >> HERE’S AMON-RA SAINT BROWN.
[ct=3434.278] DOWN HE GOES. AND THE LAST
[ct=3436.033] TIMEOUT WILL BE TAKEN. THIS
[ct=3438.158] LEAGUE HAS CHANGED. THAT WAS SO
[ct=3440.345] SMART BY SAINT BROWN TO GET
[ct=3442.365] DOWN. HE LEAVES TWO SECONDS ON
[ct=3444.753] THE CLOCK. THEY USE THEIR LAST
[ct=3445.455] TIME OUT. THIS LEAGUE HAS
[ct=3447.209] CHANGED SO MUCH. WE’RE RIGHT
[ct=3448.970] AROUND THE CORNER FROM THE
[ct=3450.168] FIRST 70 YARD FIELD GOAL THAT
[ct=3451.647] THIS LEAGUE HAS EVER SEEN
[ct=3453.755] THESE TEAMS NOW GET AROUND
[ct=3454.427] MIDFIELD AND THEY’RE THINKING
[ct=3455.239] ABOUT FIELD GOALS.
[ct=3457.308] >> YEAH I MEAN AND WELL
[ct=3460.305] THINKING FIELD GOALS HERE AND
[ct=3460.305] EVEN THE FACT THAT THEY WENT
[ct=3461.893] FOR IT THERE, THERE WAS A TIME
[ct=3464.677] NOT LONG AGO THAT WITH 20S WERE
[ct=3465.879] ON THE CLOCK WHEN THEY GOT
[ct=3466.882] POSSESSION OF THE BALL, THEY
[ct=3468.468] WOULD HAVE JUST RUN IT OUT.
[ct=3471.390] >> AND NOW THE RAVENS WILL
[ct=3473.281] SPEND A TIMEOUT. THEY’RE GOING
[ct=3475.662] TO PUT THE BALL DOWN AT THE 43
[ct=3479.045] YARD LINE, WHICH WOULD MAKE IT
[ct=3482.053] A 67 YARD FIELD GOAL. THAT
[ct=3485.242] WOULD BE THE RECORD. IF HE HITS
[ct=3490.083] THIS THE NFL RECORD. RIGHT NOW
[ct=3493.055] THAT’S HELD BY JUSTIN TUCKER,
[ct=3495.171] THE 13 YEAR KICKER LONGTIME
[ct=3499.666] WITH THE RAVENS. THIS IS A 60
[ct=3500.293] YARD TRY DURING THE PREGAME
[ct=3508.167] THAT HE HIT. AND THIS IS BEYOND
[ct=3512.456] THAT. 67 YARDS.
[ct=3514.577] >> WELL IT’S WORTH AT LEAST A
[ct=3516.617] SHOT. YOU KNOW ALTHOUGH WHEN
[ct=3518.152] YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT THIS
[ct=3519.089] DISTANCE OBVIOUSLY YOU’RE NOT
[ct=3520.940] GETTING THE BALL UP AS QUICKLY.
[ct=3523.011] AND YOU KNOW IT GIVES AN
[ct=3523.286] OPPORTUNITY FOR THIS DEFENSE AS
[ct=3525.218] WELL.
[ct=3527.298] >> WESTERNERS WAITING IN THE
[ct=3529.615] END ZONE, HE CAN RETURN IT. IT
[ct=3533.814] FALLS SHORT AND BATES HIT IT.
[ct=3535.270] THIS WOULD BE AN NFL RECORD.
[ct=3542.534] GOOD. SNAP. GOOD. HOLD THE KICK.
[ct=3551.250] IS NO GOOD. WIDE TO THE LEFT.
[ct=3555.334] RAVENS WILL RECEIVE THE SECOND
[ct=3556.949] HALF KICKOFF AS WE GIVE YOU
[ct=3563.070] ANOTHER LOOK. AND WE’LL SEND IT
[ct=3564.275] DOWN TO LAURA RUTLEDGE WITH DAN
[ct=3566.089] >> ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU JOE.
[ct=3567.546] NOW, THE KICK WASN’T GOOD
[ct=3569.271] BUT HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THE
[ct=3570.366] OFFENSE AND THE WAY IT’S
[ct=3572.442] FUNCTIONED SO FAR IN THIS GAME?
[ct=3573.867] >> WELL, WE’VE DONE A GOOD JOB.
[ct=3576.313] YOU KNOW, WE WE’D HAVE BEEN A
[ct=3578.396] LITTLE BIT BETTER THERE TOWARDS
[ct=3580.231] THE END WHEN WE GOT THE BALL
[ct=3580.231] BACK. MADE A HELL OF A STOP
[ct=3582.689] DEFENSIVELY. WE TALKED ABOUT
[ct=3582.689] PLAYING COMPLEMENTARY FOOTBALL
[ct=3584.767] AND HELPING EACH OTHER OUT. AND
[ct=3585.111] WE’VE REALLY DONE THAT. SO
[ct=3586.775] LISTEN I LIKE WHERE WE’RE AT.
[ct=3588.276] WE GOT TO REGROUP. IT’S A GOOD
[ct=3589.417] TEAM OVER THERE. BUT WE’LL
[ct=3591.575] BOUNCE BACK. BE GOOD.
[ct=3593.115] >> YOU CALLED OUT TIME OF
[ct=3593.467] POSSESSION AS IMPORTANT IN THIS
[ct=3594.374] ONE. YOU POSSESS THE BALL
[ct=3596.214] ALMOST 20 MINUTES IN THAT FIRST
[ct=3597.307] HALF. WHAT CAN YOU SAY ABOUT
[ct=3598.067] THAT?
[ct=3600.147] >> WELL, THAT’S ONE OF THE
[ct=3601.282] THINGS WE WANTED TO DO. YOU
[ct=3602.109] KNOW, WE WERE ABLE TO SUSTAIN
[ct=3604.408] DRIVES. WE GOT TO BESAID, HEY, Z
[ct=3605.278] IS GOING TO GET THE BALL.
[ct=3606.976] HE HAS GOTTEN THE BALL THE FIRST
[ct=3608.449] COUPLE OF WEEKS AND HE’S THE
[ct=3610.282] KEY, SO HE IS A FOCAL POINT FOR
[ct=3610.711] THIS OFFENSE.
[ct=3615.827] >> Joe: AIDAN HUTCHINSON
[ct=3616.450] TONIGHT, HE’S BEEN ON THE LEFT
[ct=3617.312] SIDE.
[ct=3617.962] HE’S BEEN ON THE RIGHT SIDE.
[ct=3621.751] MORE ON THE RIGHT TONIGHT, AND
[ct=3624.307] ONE SNAP ON THE INTERIOR OF THE
[ct=3624.307] DEFENSIVE LINE.
[ct=3628.850] THIS IS ALI AND RASHEEN ALI OUT
[ct=3629.398] ACROSS THE 25.
[ct=3631.256] MOMENTS AGO LISA SALTERS CAUGHT
[ct=3631.523] UP WITH JOHN HARBAUGH.
[ct=3634.346] LD BROWN JOHN, YOU GET THE BALL
[ct=3635.554] TO START THIS SECOND HALF.
[ct=3637.640] THERE WAS SOME SUCCESS BUT ALSO
[ct=3638.690] SOME FRUSTRATION ON OFFENSE IN
[ct=3639.467] THE FIRST HALF.
[ct=3640.821] WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO CLEAN UP?
[ct=3643.170] >> WELL, WE’D LIKE -- LOVE TO
[ct=3644.928] FINISH THAT DRIVE GOING IN BUT I
[ct=3646.147] THOUGHT OUR DEFENSE DID A GREAT
[ct=3647.322] JOB STEPPING UP AND GETTING THAT
[ct=3648.175] SACK.
[ct=3649.904] YOU GO FOR IT, PIN THEM BACK IN,
[ct=3651.198] THAT’S THE WORST CASE SCENARIO
[ct=3652.610] BUT THEN OUT TO THE 20 AND OUR
[ct=3653.856] DEFENSE STEPPED UP SO I’M PROUD.
[ct=3656.264] IT’LL BE THAT KIND OF GAME BACK
[ct=3656.955] AND FORTH.
[ct=3658.236] FIND THE WAY TO WIN THE NEXT
[ct=3658.609] DRIVE.
[ct=3660.199] >> Lisa: YOU TALKED ABOUT YOUR
[ct=3662.997] THAT 18-PLAY SEEMED TO TAKE A
[ct=3663.422] LOT OUT OF THEM.
[ct=3665.351] WHAT DID YOU LIKE ABOUT THE WAY
[ct=3666.274] THEY BOUNCE BACK?
[ct=3667.808] >> I DO APPRECIATE THAT.
[ct=3669.064] I THOUGHT WE FOUGHT THROUGH THE
[ct=3670.493] WE JUST DIDN’T GET OFF THE FIELD
[ct=3671.029] ON THIRD DOWN.
[ct=3673.075] A LOT OF THIRD AND LONGS.
[ct=3675.157] WE NEED TO GET OFF THE FIELD IF
[ct=3677.701] WE CAN WHICH WE DID THE LAST TWO
[ct=3679.259] >> Lisa: THANK YOU, COACH.
[ct=3680.197] >> Joe: LISA, THANK YOU.
[ct=3680.894] JOHN, THANK YOU.
[ct=3683.266] A LITTLE DROP-OFF PASS TO
[ct=3684.083] DERRICK HENRY AND HE GOES
[ct=3685.032] FORWARD FOR SEVEN AND WE’RE
[ct=3685.781] UNDER WAY IN THE SECOND HALF.
[ct=3688.908] SECOND DOWN AND THREE IN A TIE
[ct=3689.312] BALL GAME.
[ct=3693.100] >> Troy: HERE’S A LOOK AT AIDAN
[ct=3694.771] HUTCHINSON, AND HE’S KIND OF
[ct=3696.241] BEEN A LITTLE QUIET IN THE FIRST
[ct=3697.346] HALF BUT DRAWS A LOT OF
[ct=3699.117] ATTENTION SO GETS THE CHIP AND
[ct=3701.305] DOUBLE TEAM AS HE’S BEEN WORKING
[ct=3702.778] BOTH SIDES OF THE OFFENSIVE
[ct=3702.778] LINE.
[ct=3704.555] HE’S BEEN WORKING AGAINST RONNIE
[ct=3707.289] STANLEY THEN TO THE OTHER SIDE
[ct=3708.092] AGAINST ROGER ROSENGARTEN, BUT
[ct=3710.110] THEY COME IN, CERTAINLY AS EVERY
[ct=3710.385] OFFENSE DOES WITH A PLAN.
[ct=3715.563] >> Joe: HENRY IS A YARD SHORT,
[ct=3717.793] MAYBE A HALF YARD SHORT OF A
[ct=3718.589] FIRST DOWN AS JACK CAMPBELL MADE
[ct=3719.228] THAT STOP.
[ct=3723.232] SO THIRD DOWN COMING UP.
[ct=3727.546] SAID JUST THREW IT OUT THERE AS
[ct=3729.621] YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS TONIGHT,
[ct=3731.620] ONLY UNINCOMPLETION.
[ct=3732.643] LAMAR JACKSON HAS THE BEST
[ct=3733.857] PASSER RATING, THAT’S NOT --
[ct=3736.954] DOESN’T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE
[ct=3737.308] RUNNING AT ALL, THE BEST PASSER
[ct=3738.108] RATING IN THE HISTORY OF THE
[ct=3738.532] LEAGUE.
[ct=3741.171] >> Troy: I SAW THAT TODAY AS
[ct=3741.171] WELL, JOE.
[ct=3743.943] I DON’T WANT TO SAY I WAS AMAZED
[ct=3745.523] BUT I WAS SURPRISED BUT IT DOES
[ct=3747.992] SPEAK TO WHAT WE’VE TALKED ABOUT
[ct=3750.359] AND HOW MUCH HE HAS GROWN AND
[ct=3751.126] HOW GOOD HE’S BEEN IN THE
[ct=3752.817] POCKET.
[ct=3754.522] AS THEY WERE ABLE TO GET THE
[ct=3756.126] LIONS, WHAT LOOKED TO BE
[ct=3757.600] OFFSIDES
[ct=3759.093] >> Referee: DEFENSE, NUMBER 51.
[ct=3760.734] BURROW, LINE UP
[ct=3764.039] WHOEVER YOU WANT BEHIND THOSE
[ct=3764.393] NAMES.
[ct=3765.621] IT’S LAMAR JACKSON ON TOP.
[ct=3766.243] >> Troy: WE TALKED ABOUT IT
[ct=3767.927] BEFORE AND HEARD STEVE YOUNG
[ct=3769.243] TALK ABOUT IT WHEN HE BECAME
[ct=3770.874] FEARED IS WHEN HE BECAME A
[ct=3771.674] PASSER AND LESS OF A RUNNER.
[ct=3774.603] >> Joe: HERE’S A NEAR
[ct=3776.754] >> Troy: OH.
[ct=3778.882] >> Joe: AND IT’LL NEVER BE ANY
[ct=3779.909] EASIER FOR BRIAN BRANCH AND HE
[ct=3781.469] JUST DROPPED IT.
[ct=3783.073] >> Troy: HE READS IT PERFECTLY
[ct=3786.003] HAS HIS EYES BACK ON LAMAR AS
[ct=3787.856] HE’S CARRYING IT UP THE FEEL AND
[ct=3791.361] JUST DOES AN OUTSTANDING JOB.
[ct=3792.659] IT’S MARK ANDREWS WHO IS IN THE
[ct=3795.373] SEAM, EXCUSE ME, HE’S GOT MARK
[ct=3798.769] ANDREWS BUT WORKING BACK TO THE
[ct=3800.815] INSIDE AGAINST CHARLIE KOLAR AND
[ct=3801.831] JUST BOUNCES OFF HIS HANDS.
[ct=3803.950] THERE ARE GUYS THAT CAN’T CATCH
[ct=3805.007] THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=3808.570] BRIAN BRANCH IS NOT ONE OF THEM.
[ct=3810.846] >> Joe: HE’LL BE THINKING ABOUT
[ct=3811.736] THAT GOING TO BED TONIGHT.
[ct=3812.379] SECOND DOWN AND TEN.
[ct=3816.659] BLITZ COMING.
[ct=3823.005] PASS IS CAUGHT BY ANDREWS, AND
[ct=3823.005] CAMPBELL IN ON THE STOP, A GAIN
[ct=3823.261] OF FOUR, THIRD DOWN.
[ct=3825.796] >> Troy: I WAS TALKING ABOUT IT
[ct=3827.470] WITH STEVE YOUNG AND HE HAS
[ct=3828.670] TALKED TO OTHER QUARTERBACKS
[ct=3829.743] THAT HAVE COME INTO THIS LEAGUE
[ct=3830.812] ABOUT, YEAH, IT’S GREAT TO BE
[ct=3832.705] ABLE TO RUN BUT ULTIMATELY YOU
[ct=3833.512] GOT TO BEAT DEFENSES WITH YOUR
[ct=3833.874] ARM.
[ct=3835.320] IF YOU’RE GOING TO BE A
[ct=3836.598] CHAMPIONSHIP QUARTERBACK AND
[ct=3838.764] WE’VE SEEN THAT FROM LAMAR, I
[ct=3840.798] MEAN, THEY’VE GOT A GREAT SCHEME
[ct=3842.397] AND THEY’VE GOT REALLY GOOD
[ct=3843.787] PLAYERS AROUND HIM BUT WATCHING
[ct=3845.084] HIM THROW THE FOOTBALL THE WAY
[ct=3846.392] HE HAS OVER THE LAST SEVERAL
[ct=3847.922] YEARS NOW WITH TODD MONKEN AS
[ct=3850.082] THE OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR, IT’S
[ct=3852.529] BEEN IMPRESSIVE AND WHAT WE
[ct=3853.869] SHOWED WITH THAT GRAPHIC, HIM
[ct=3857.217] BEING RATED NUMBER ONE PASSER
[ct=3857.217] RATING, PRETTY GOOD.
[ct=3858.755] >> Joe: THIRD DOWN.
[ct=3859.763] THERE’S HIS FIRST TARGET.
[ct=3861.622] THERE’S HIS FIRST CATCH.
[ct=3861.882] FLOWERS AND THEY’RE GOING TO
[ct=3862.674] GIVE HIM A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=3868.024] ZAY FLOWERS GETS HIS FIRST.
[ct=3870.606] THEY GOT A GOOD SPOT, AND FIRST
[ct=3872.689] DOWN FOR BALTIMORE.
[ct=3873.849] >> Troy: A LITTLE PICK WITH MARK
[ct=3875.012] ANDREWS AS HE COMES OFF THE
[ct=3877.728] BALL, AND ZAY FLOWERS COMES
[ct=3878.105] UNDERNEATH.
[ct=3879.594] THEY’RE ANTICIPATING MAN
[ct=3880.777] COVERAGE BECAUSE THEY’RE SO
[ct=3883.000] HEAVY WITH DETROIT’S COVER ONE,
[ct=3885.963] AND GOOD CALL, GOOD EXECUTION
[ct=3887.007] AND THEY’RE ABLE TO FINALLY FREE
[ct=3888.242] HIM UP FOR THE COMPLETION.
[ct=3889.553] >> Joe: CATCH NUMBER 15 ON THE
[ct=3890.689] SEASON, FIRST OF THE NIGHT.
[ct=3890.972] THERE’S TODD MONKEN.
[ct=3895.649] A JOB HE HAS DONE, NUMBER 3, HIS
[ct=3896.855] OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR FOR JOHN
[ct=3897.616] HARBAUGH AND LAMAR JACKSON.
[ct=3897.883] HERE’S HENRY.
[ct=3902.736] AND DERRICK ABLE TO TAKE IT
[ct=3903.084] INSIDE THE 45.
[ct=3904.447] GOT FOUR.
[ct=3905.601] >> Troy: YOU KNOW, EVEN WITH
[ct=3907.135] THAT SAID WHEN WE TALK ABOUT
[ct=3909.149] WHAT LAMAR’S DONE THROWING THE
[ct=3910.926] FOOTBALL, MAKE NO MISTAKE, THIS
[ct=3912.351] IS STILL AN OFFENSE THAT JUST
[ct=3914.307] WANTS TO BE PHYSICAL AND RUN THE
[ct=3916.748] FOOTBALL AND SO EVEN WHEN YOU
[ct=3918.439] LOOK AT THE YARDS, THE PASSING
[ct=3920.100] YARDS, IT DOESN’T REALLY TELL
[ct=3920.820] THE ENTIRE STORY.
[ct=3922.943] LAST YEAR THEY WERE SEVENTH IN
[ct=3925.368] THE LEAGUE IN PASSING YARDS, BUT
[ct=3927.539] THEY WERE NUMBER ONE IN YARDS
[ct=3931.332] PER PASS, SO THAT’S A BETTER
[ct=3933.262] INDICATOR AS JUST HOW EFFECTIVE
[ct=3934.312] THEY ARE THROWING THE FOOTBALL
[ct=3934.827] BECAUSE THEY’LL RUN IT MORE THAN
[ct=3935.705] OTHER TEAMS.
[ct=3942.256] JACKSON KEEPS, WIDE OPEN IS
[ct=3943.765] KOLAR AND HE’S GOT A FIRST DOWN
[ct=3945.790] AFTER BREAKING A TACKLE AND THE
[ct=3946.515] BALL JUST OUTSIDE THE 25.
[ct=3952.173] 18 YARDS FOR CHARLIE KOLAR.
[ct=3955.016] >> Troy: WELL, CHARLIE KOLAR, I
[ct=3956.265] KNOW HE DOESN’T GET MANY
[ct=3957.970] OPPORTUNITIES, THAT’S HIS FIRST
[ct=3959.707] TARGET, BUT THEY JUST TOTALLY
[ct=3960.136] TURN HIM LOOSE.
[ct=3961.997] I MEAN, THEY DON’T EVEN WORRY
[ct=3963.504] ABOUT HIM COMING OFF THE
[ct=3965.233] FOOTBALL AND THAT’S -- YOU
[ct=3967.607] COULDN’T GO OUT THERE AND
[ct=3968.591] PRACTICE AND HAVE IT ANY EASIER
[ct=3968.997] THAN THAT.
[ct=3978.557] >> Referee: THE BALL WILL BE
[ct=3980.437] SPOTTED AT THE 29 YARD LINE.
[ct=3983.305] >> Joe: THEY’LL SAY THE KNEE WAS
[ct=3984.588] DOWN OR SOME BODY PART WAS DOWN
[ct=3987.095] ON THAT LAST LUNGE BY KOLAR, AND
[ct=3988.663] THEY MOVE THE BALL BACK TO THE
[ct=3988.663] 29.
[ct=3991.357] THEY MOVED IT BACK THREE YARDS.
[ct=3995.171] FIRST AND TENSION.
[ct=3998.827] THEY’RE WITHOUT ISAIAH LIKELY.
[ct=4000.454] HE BROKE HIS FOOT AT THE END OF
[ct=4001.269] JULY.
[ct=4002.529] HAD FOOT SURGERY ON HIS RIGHT
[ct=4005.080] FOOT AUGUST 1st, AND HE IS CLOSE
[ct=4008.501] TO COMING BACK AND ANOTHER
[ct=4009.255] WEAPON FOR LAMAR JACKSON.
[ct=4011.991] >> Troy: YOU COMBINE THAT WITH
[ct=4013.052] PATRICK RICARD, THEIR FULLBACK,
[ct=4014.338] WHO IS A BIG PART OF THIS
[ct=4016.501] SO THEY’RE MISSING SOME KEY
[ct=4016.501] GUYS.
[ct=4020.707] >> Joe: FLOWERS IN MOTION.
[ct=4023.211] JACKSON KEEPS, ANDREWS GOT IT.
[ct=4024.992] STRONG CATCH BY MARK ANDREWS.
[ct=4027.973] AGAINST BRIAN BRANCH FOR 20.
[ct=4032.875] >> Troy: AND HE WAS OPEN A LOT
[ct=4033.937] SOONER AS HE CAME OFF THE BALL.
[ct=4035.863] PLAY ACTION BUT BRIAN BRANCH IS
[ct=4036.616] LOCKED UP ONE-ON-ONE.
[ct=4038.222] HE’S NOT EVEN LOOKING IN THE
[ct=4040.972] HE HAS HIS EYES ON ANDREWS BUT
[ct=4042.102] ANDREWS JUST COMES OFFER THE
[ct=4044.158] BALL, RUNS RIGHT PAST HIM SO HE
[ct=4045.702] HAD A LOT OF SEPARATION BUT
[ct=4046.856] LAMAR WASN’T READY TO THROW THE
[ct=4047.582] FOOTBALL AT THAT TIME.
[ct=4049.813] THEN IT BECAME CONTESTED.
[ct=4051.359] THAT’S A GREAT JOB BY ANDREWS
[ct=4052.221] GOING UP AND MAKING A PLAY.
[ct=4054.646] >> Joe: BRANCH COULDN’T MAKE
[ct=4055.207] THAT PLAY.
[ct=4057.125] COULDN’T MAKE THE INTERCEPTION
[ct=4057.498] EARLIER ON THIS POSSESSION.
[ct=4060.686] >> Troy: YEAH.
[ct=4061.410] >> Joe: FIRST AND GOAL RIGHT AT
[ct=4061.970] THE 10.
[ct=4065.994] HENRY IS GOING TO THROW, LOBBING
[ct=4066.287] IT AND THAT COULD HAVE BEEN
[ct=4068.157] PICKED OFF BY D.J. REED.
[ct=4075.403] TYLAN WALLACE WAS THE TARGET,
[ct=4076.652] AND AN ILL-ADVISED PASS.
[ct=4079.894] THE RAVENS ARE LUCKY THAT WASN’T
[ct=4080.339] INTERCEPTED.
[ct=4081.761] >> Troy: YEAH, AS SOON AS HE
[ct=4084.880] SLOWS UP, AS SOON AS DERRICK
[ct=4085.823] HENRY SLOWS UP, IT DIDN’T LOOK
[ct=4086.967] GOOD BUT HE HAD LAMAR JACKSON
[ct=4089.158] OUT THE OTHER SIDE IF HE HAD
[ct=4090.373] STOPPED AND LOOKED AND YOU KNOW
[ct=4091.510] IN PRACTICE THEY HAD TALKED TO
[ct=4094.126] HIM SAYING, HEY, LAMAR JACKSON
[ct=4095.555] IS AN OUTLET IF YOU WANT TO GET
[ct=4096.124] BACK TO IT.
[ct=4098.343] THEY TOTALLY TURNED HIM LOOSE
[ct=4100.985] BUT AS SOON AS HENRY STOPPED AND
[ct=4103.094] KIND OF DOUBLE CLUTCHED IT WAS
[ct=4103.547] NOT GOOD.
[ct=4104.943] HE PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE JUST
[ct=4106.379] THROWN IT AWAY.
[ct=4108.605] >> Joe: NOW SECOND AND GOAL.
[ct=4110.116] JACKSON TRYING TO FIND SOMEWHERE
[ct=4110.116] TO GO.
[ct=4111.928] BROUGHT DOWN FROM BEHIND.
[ct=4117.289] AND THAT IS A AL-QUADIN MUHAMMAD
[ct=4118.598] WHO THEY’LL COUNT ON A LOT AFTER
[ct=4120.287] THE INJURY TO MARCUS DAVENPORT,
[ct=4122.092] HE GETS HIS SECOND SACK.
[ct=4123.637] >> Troy: WILL, WHEN WE TALKED TO
[ct=4125.049] TODD MONKEN, HE SAID LAMAR
[ct=4129.231] JACKSON, IT’S KIND OF THE PRICE
[ct=4131.692] OF PLAYING BUSINESS OR COST OF
[ct=4133.449] DOING BUSINESS, EXCUSE ME, THAT
[ct=4135.702] HE DOESN’T THROW IT AWAY.
[ct=4136.337] YOU KNOW, THAT HE’S GOING TO TRY
[ct=4139.704] TO MAKE A PLAY AND HE TRIED TO
[ct=4140.364] THERE THEN LOST SOME YARDS.
[ct=4146.400] >> Joe: SINCE LAST YEAR, JUST,
[ct=4149.503] WELL, UNDER ONE ON AVERAGE THROW
[ct=4150.377] AWAY A GAME.
[ct=4153.160] NUMBER TWO IN THE LEAGUE TO
[ct=4154.191] BAKER MAYFIELD AND NOW ON THIRD
[ct=4155.875] DOWN, ANDREWS, DIVING CATCH,
[ct=4157.594] TOUCHDOWN, RAVENS!
[ct=4178.844] >> Troy: ALEX ANZALONE IS IN
[ct=4181.160] PRETTY GOOD COVERAGE ACTUALLY.
[ct=4182.599] HE’S LOCKED UP MAN-TO-MAN AND
[ct=4184.629] THIS IS JUST -- IT’S A GOOD
[ct=4186.429] ROUTE BY ANDREWS AND THEN IT’S
[ct=4187.521] JUST A PERFECTLY THROWN BALL BY
[ct=4191.087] HE JUST LAYS IT OUT THERE AND
[ct=4192.462] GIVES MARK ANDREWS AN
[ct=4193.908] OPPORTUNITY TO JUST GO MAKE A
[ct=4197.217] PLAY BUT NOT BAD COVERAGE
[ct=4197.912] OVERALL BY ANZALONE TRYING TO
[ct=4199.890] STICK WITH MARK ANDREWS, JUST A
[ct=4200.862] PERFECTLY THROWN BALL.
[ct=4201.878] >> Joe: ON A PERFECT NIGHT FOR
[ct=4205.465] THE EXTRA POINT NOW BY LOOP.
[ct=4208.516] SEVEN-POINT RAVENS LEAD.
[ct=4211.631] MARK ANDREWS, THEY WANTED TO GET
[ct=4212.705] HIM INVOLVED TONIGHT.
[ct=4214.293] WELL, THEY HAVE, FIVE TARGETS,
[ct=4216.675] FIVE CATCHES, 64 YARDS, AND A
[ct=4223.611] 14 YARDS AWAY.ATTITUDE, WHICH TH
[ct=4224.230] WEREN’T WORRIED ABOUT AT ALL.
[ct=4225.523] HE’S RESPONDED AND RESPONDED
[ct=4228.004] >> Troy: A GUY WHO’S DONE SO
[ct=4229.081] MUCH FOR THIS ORGANIZATION TO
[ct=4230.045] HAVE TO LIVE WITH THAT
[ct=4231.828] THROUGHOUT THE OFF-SEASON, HE’S
[ct=4232.416] HAD HIMSELF A NIGHT.
[ct=4233.783] YOU KNEW IT WAS COMING.
[ct=4235.406] YOU DIDN’T KNOW EXACTLY WHEN BUT
[ct=4236.600] HE’S JUST BEEN TOO VALUABLE TO
[ct=4243.575] >> Joe: THAT WAS SHORT.
[ct=4245.802] >> Referee: 15 OR 33, BALL WILL
[ct=4246.130] BE PLACED AT THE 40 YARD LINE.
[ct=4248.203] >> Joe: THAT’S THE SECOND TIME
[ct=4250.700] THAT TYLER LOOP, THE ROOKIE HAS
[ct=4251.508] BEEN SHORT OF THE LANDING ZONE
[ct=4252.950] AND THAT MEANS THE BALL COMES
[ct=4256.915] OUT TO THE 40 SO HE’S HAD A
[ct=4261.140] COUPLE OF BAD KICKOFFS AND NOW
[ct=4261.415] ADDS ANOTHER.
[ct=4262.708] CHECK IN WITH LISA IN A MOMENT.
[ct=4269.650] AND SEEING A LOT OF THESE
[ct=4271.722] KICKERS THAT ARE TRYING TO
[ct=4272.969] FIGURE OUT WAYS TO JUST GET IT
[ct=4274.715] INTO THE LANDING ZONE AND HE WAS
[ct=4275.701] JUST SHORT OF DOING THAT.
[ct=4277.139] >> Troy: GETS COSTLY WHEN YOU’RE
[ct=4278.372] IN A GAME LIKE THIS AGAINST AN
[ct=4279.230] OFFENSE LIKE THE LIONS.
[ct=4283.865] >> Joe: GOFF, LOW FOR JAMESON
[ct=4287.285] LET’S CHECK IN WITH LISA.
[ct=4288.558] >> Lisa: YEAH, JOE, LAMAR
[ct=4289.729] JACKSON TOLD US THIS WEEKEND HE
[ct=4292.474] WAS NOT WORRIED A BIT ABOUT MARK
[ct=4295.102] ANDREWS OR HIS STATE OF MIND
[ct=4295.992] COMING INTO THIS GAME WITH JUST
[ct=4297.028] TWO CATCHES FOR SEVEN YARDS.
[ct=4300.392] HE SAID MARK IS GOOD AND HE
[ct=4302.918] REMINDED US ANDREWS GOT OFF TO A
[ct=4304.368] SLOW START LAST YEAR, SIX
[ct=4306.183] CATCHES FOR 65 YARD, ZERO
[ct=4306.919] TOUCHDOWNS THROUGH THE FIRST
[ct=4308.506] FOUR WEEKS OF 2024 AND FINISHED
[ct=4309.835] WITH 11 TOUCHDOWNS SO LAMAR
[ct=4311.407] SAID, WE START THE SAME EVERY
[ct=4313.222] YEAR, EVERYBODY ELSE GETS THE
[ct=4314.654] BALL THEN DEFENSES TAKE THEIR
[ct=4315.393] EYES OFF MARK AND HE GOES CRAZY.
[ct=4319.609] >> Joe: HE’S GONE CRAZY TONIGHT.
[ct=4320.809] GIBBS, NICE RUN, AND HE GOT HIT
[ct=4322.453] AND HIT HARD BY CHIDOBE AWUZIE.
[ct=4327.390] LONGTIME CORNER IN THE LEAGUE
[ct=4329.051] BUT A GAIN OF SEVEN, THIRD AND
[ct=4329.679] THREE COMING UP.
[ct=4331.239] HERE’S THE HIT BY AWUZIE.
[ct=4334.239] >> Troy: AWUZIE, I MENTIONED IT.
[ct=4336.415] YOU SEE THE HIT, THAT’S A
[ct=4339.068] BIG-TIME HIT AND WHEN YOU WATCH
[ct=4340.231] BOTH THESE DEFENSES PLAY,
[ct=4342.332] AWUZIE, HE’S A COVER CORNER.
[ct=4344.480] HE’S A GOOD PLAYER, BUT WHETHER
[ct=4346.909] IT’S FOR THE RAVENS OR FOR THE
[ct=4347.598] LIONS, IT DOESN’T MATTER THAT
[ct=4349.007] YOU’RE A COVER CORNER, YOU
[ct=4351.895] BETTER BE A TACKLER AS WELL.
[ct=4353.230] AND FOR THE MOST PART ALL THESE
[ct=4355.389] DEFENSIVE BACKS ARE.
[ct=4360.524] >> Joe: THIRD DOWN AND THREE.
[ct=4361.998] GOOD PROTECTION.
[ct=4365.672] GOOD THROW AND LaPORTA HAS FOR
[ct=4366.321] CONVERSION ON THIRD DOWN.
[ct=4368.525] HE COULDN’T HAVE HANDED IT TO
[ct=4369.787] HIM ANY BETTER THAN THAT.
[ct=4370.809] WHAT A THROW.
[ct=4371.815] >> Troy: ROQUAN SMITH IS THE ONE
[ct=4375.993] WHO IS IN COVERAGE, AND HERE HE
[ct=4377.468] IS AND HE DOES AN EXCELLENT JOB
[ct=4379.561] AS LaPORTA COMES OUT, HE ACTS
[ct=4380.702] LIKE HE’S GOING TO GO BREAK
[ct=4382.494] OUTSIDE, COMES BACK IN, BUT THE
[ct=4384.186] BALL HAD TO BE THROWN JUST
[ct=4384.186] PERFECTLY AS IT WAS.
[ct=4388.526] >> Joe: LaPORTA’S GOT THREE
[ct=4390.577] CATCHES ALL ON THIRD DOWNS AND
[ct=4391.271] ALL HAVE CONVERTED.
[ct=4401.205] THEY HAND TO GIBBS.
[ct=4401.205] AND THEY’VE STAYED WITH A RUN.
[ct=4403.243] GIBBS GETS TEN.
[ct=4405.616] >> Troy: WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE
[ct=4407.122] LIONS LAST YEAR, JOE, TALKING
[ct=4408.208] ABOUT THIRD DOWNS, THEY WERE
[ct=4409.936] FOURTH IN THE NFL CONVERTING
[ct=4414.356] THIRD DOWNS AND HASN’T BEEN
[ct=4415.358] GREAT, THE FIRST COUPLE WEEKS OF
[ct=4416.944] THE SEASON, AND IT’S BEEN EVEN
[ct=4419.405] WORSE WHEN IT’S BEEN THIRD AND
[ct=4419.753] SIX PLUS.
[ct=4423.238] I MEAN, THEY CONVERTED 1 OF 14
[ct=4423.834] COMING INTO THE GAME TONIGHT AND
[ct=4425.221] YET THEY’VE DONE A HECK OF A
[ct=4425.537] JOB.
[ct=4427.394] THERE’S A LOOK AT JOHN MORTON
[ct=4429.814] AND THEY’RE CONVERTING 70%.
[ct=4432.853] THAT 98-PLAY OR 98-YARD DRIVE
[ct=4435.000] THEY HAD, A LOT OF THIRD DOWN
[ct=4436.304] CONVERSION, GOFF’S BEEN GOOD ON
[ct=4436.667] THAT DOWN.
[ct=4442.301] >> Joe: AND GIBBS SHORT SO PICKS
[ct=4443.963] IT UP ON SECOND AND LESS THAN
[ct=4445.935] ONE, JOHN JENKINS, 13-YEAR PRO
[ct=4448.366] FROM GEORGIA.
[ct=4451.914] MADE THAT TACKLE BUT NOT BEFORE
[ct=4456.671] A FIRST DOWN PICKUP BY JAHMYR
[ct=4459.037] WE SAW JOHN MORTON WITH THE
[ct=4459.606] LIONS TAKES OVER FOR BEN
[ct=4461.888] JOHNSON, WHO THREE YEARS IS THE
[ct=4462.619] OC IN DETROIT.
[ct=4464.416] THEY LED THE LEAGUE IN POINTS
[ct=4465.139] PER GAME.
[ct=4466.866] 18th YEAR IN THE LEAGUE AS A
[ct=4467.180] COACH FOR MORTON.
[ct=4470.490] SPENT THE LAST TWO SEASONS WITH
[ct=4472.828] SEAN PAYTON IN DENVER.
[ct=4473.987] BUT HE WAS WITH DETROIT BEFORE
[ct=4476.723] HE WENT TO DENVER, VERY
[ct=4477.695] COMFORTABLE COMING BACK IN
[ct=4478.364] CALLING PLAYS.
[ct=4480.703] ON FIRST DOWN, A TOSS TO
[ct=4483.555] THROWS BACK TO GOFF.
[ct=4486.480] WHO AIRS IT OUT FOR ST. BROWN.
[ct=4488.179] WHAT A PLAY.
[ct=4490.041] AND WHAT A TIME TO SHOW JOHN
[ct=4494.291] MORTON AS THEY GO INTO THEIR BAG
[ct=4495.975] OF TRICKS AND COME UP WITH THAT
[ct=4496.399] FOR 17.
[ct=4497.129] >> Troy: BUY A LITTLE TIME.
[ct=4498.959] A LITTLE TRICKERY.
[ct=4499.799] TAKE THE HOME RUN SHOT IF YOU
[ct=4500.677] HAVE IT.
[ct=4504.528] IF YOU DON’T, THEN YOU GET AN
[ct=4505.941] OPPORTUNITY TO TRY TO TAKE
[ct=4508.119] INTERMEDIATE THROW WHICH IS
[ct=4509.718] EXACTLY WHAT HE DOES, INITIALLY,
[ct=4510.737] YOU LOOK AT THIS AND SAY, OKAY,
[ct=4512.869] WAS IT BACKWARDS.
[ct=4514.282] IT WAS BACKWARDS SO DO A HECK OF
[ct=4515.831] A JOB THERE AS FAR AS THE
[ct=4518.959] EXECUTION GOES AND THEN GOFF
[ct=4520.069] BEING PATIENT AND NOT BEING TOO
[ct=4520.736] GREEDY ON THE PLAY.
[ct=4526.444] >> Joe: ST. BROWN IN MOTION.
[ct=4528.166] GOFF FOR ST. BROWN.
[ct=4532.817] HE IS THERE AND HE’S GOT IT.
[ct=4533.120] TOUCHDOWN, DETROIT.
[ct=4535.418] WHAT A THROW AND CATCH.
[ct=4543.404] WORKING AGAINST MARLON HUMPHREY
[ct=4546.129] AND EXTRA POINT AWAY FROM A TIE
[ct=4547.273] >> Troy: JARED GOFF AT THE TOP
[ct=4547.659] OF HIS GAME.
[ct=4550.943] ONE, AN EXCELLENT ROUTE BY
[ct=4551.611] AMON-RA ST. BROWN, DOUBLE MOVE
[ct=4554.238] ON MARLON HUMPHREY, SO GOFF
[ct=4556.377] ISN’T SO MUCH WORRIED ABOUT ST.
[ct=4558.106] BROWN WINNING ON THE ROUTE, HE’S
[ct=4559.697] GOT TO HOLD HAMILTON.
[ct=4561.866] HAMILTON, THE SAFETY, IS
[ct=4566.180] WATCHING AS WELL, AND HE HAS TO
[ct=4566.929] HOLD HIM TO KEEP HIM FROM GOING
[ct=4568.030] OVER THE TOP.
[ct=4570.515] HE DOES THAT PERFECTLY, AND THEN
[ct=4570.515] THROWS A GREAT BALL.
[ct=4576.212] >> Joe: WHAT AN ANSWER BY
[ct=4581.309] SEVEN PLAYS, 60 YARDS IN 3:30.
[ct=4583.706] WE’RE TIED AT 21.
[ct=4587.009] IT’S LIKE A HEAVYWEIGHT FIGHT.
[ct=4588.059] THESE TWO TEAMS JUST STANDING IN
[ct=4592.374] HIS HERITAGE BY HOSTING YOUTH
[ct=4593.979] SUMMER CAMPS IN GERMANY.
[ct=4595.777] HIS MOTHER IS GERMAN, AND IT WAS
[ct=4599.107] FOOTAGE FROM A JUNE VISIT.
[ct=4601.186] HE VISITED A PRESCHOOL HE
[ct=4606.281] ATTENDED IN VERKUSEN WHICH
[ct=4608.310] BORDERS THE CITY OF COLOGNE.
[ct=4609.488] HE SPEAKS TO HIS MOTHER IN
[ct=4611.284] GERMAN DETAILED IN "MONDAY NIGHT
[ct=4613.323] COUNTDOWN."
[ct=4615.966] HE JUST TOOK IT INTO THE END
[ct=4617.408] ZONE ON THAT BEAUTIFUL THROW
[ct=4620.277] FROM GOFF, AND NOW JAKE BATES
[ct=4620.655] KICKS IT OUT.
[ct=4623.848] >> Referee: BALL WILL BE PLACED
[ct=4624.524] AT THE 40 YARD LINE.
[ct=4627.672] >> Joe: DOWN TO LAURA RUTLEDGE.
[ct=4628.909] >> Laura: JOE, AMON-RA ST. BROWN
[ct=4630.110] SAID BEING GERMAN IS REALLY
[ct=4630.786] IMPORTANT TO ME.
[ct=4631.970] REALLY A CRUCIAL PART OF MY
[ct=4632.699] LIFE.
[ct=4634.627] AS YOU MENTIONED, HE ONLY SPEAKS
[ct=4636.088] GERMAN TO HIS MOM SO HE GETS A
[ct=4637.194] LOT OF PRACTICE WITH IT BUT
[ct=4638.742] REALLY GERMAN WAS HIS FIRST
[ct=4639.541] LANGUAGE GROWING UP.
[ct=4642.723] HIS MOM ONLY SPOKE GERMAN IN THE
[ct=4644.850] HOUSE TO HIM AND HIS BROTHERS
[ct=4645.463] AND GOES BACK TO GERMANY ONCE A
[ct=4646.033] YEAR.
[ct=4647.181] HE LOVES THE CULTURE AND LOVES
[ct=4649.194] CELEBRATING IT.
[ct=4650.330] >> Joe: WELL, HIS FAMILY IS VERY
[ct=4650.875] PROUD OF THEM.
[ct=4653.793] THEY HAVE AN EXTREMELY ATHLETIC
[ct=4654.390] FAMILY AS ZAY FLOWERS MAKES HIS
[ct=4654.995] SECOND CATCH.
[ct=4656.583] A LITTLE CATCH AND RUN.
[ct=4661.958] GOT A GOOD BLOCK FROM MARK
[ct=4664.339] ANDREWS WHO HAD A TOUCHDOWN THE
[ct=4665.413] LAST TIME THE RAVENS HAD THE
[ct=4666.997] BALL IN A GAIN OF SEVEN.
[ct=4668.815] >> Troy: YOU MENTIONED AMON-RA
[ct=4670.558] ST. BROWN AND I TALKED ABOUT THE
[ct=4671.927] JOB THAT BRAD HOLMES ALSO DONE
[ct=4677.602] AS GENERAL MANAGER
[ct=4679.354] TALENT.
[ct=4680.194] WHEN HE IS A FOURTH ROUND PICK
[ct=4681.356] AND THE QUARTERBACK SAYS HE’S
[ct=4682.422] THE BEST RECEIVER THE
[ct=4683.651] QUARTERBACK HAS EVER THROWN TO
[ct=4686.176] AND YOU NAME A FEW OF THEM OVER
[ct=4688.512] THE YEARS, THAT KIND OF TELLS
[ct=4689.667] YOU WHAT BRAD HOLMES HAS DONE
[ct=4690.227] WITH THIS ROSTER.
[ct=4692.115] >> Joe: SECOND DOWN AND THREE.
[ct=4693.943] LAMAR JACKSON IS GOING TO BE
[ct=4696.939] WRAPPED UP BY MUHAMMAD.
[ct=4697.327] HIS SECOND OF THE NIGHT.
[ct=4703.281] AL-QUADIN MUHAMMAD, HE IS WITH
[ct=4704.151] HIS FIFTH TEAM.
[ct=4705.769] IN HIS SEVENTH YEAR.
[ct=4707.865] 30 YEARS OLD, AND THEY ARE
[ct=4709.997] REALLY GOING TO BE LEANING ON
[ct=4709.997] HIM.
[ct=4711.191] >> Troy: YES, THEY ARE AND
[ct=4714.276] WHATEVER HE MAY LACK IN ABILITY
[ct=4716.395] HE MAKES UP FOR IN HIS
[ct=4716.989] TENACIOUSNESS IN THE WAY IN
[ct=4718.764] WHICH HE CONTINUES TO COMPETE
[ct=4719.672] AND BATTLE AND THE EFFORT THAT
[ct=4721.210] HE GIVES AND THAT’S WHAT ALLOWS
[ct=4721.700] HIM TO MAKE THE PLAY HERE.
[ct=4724.491] I MEAN, HE DEFINITELY IS BEING
[ct=4724.857] RELIED ON.
[ct=4727.412] YOU LOSE MARCUS DAVENPORT AND
[ct=4729.816] OTHERS HAVE TO BE ABLE TO COME
[ct=4732.032] IN AND KIND OF FILL THAT VOID
[ct=4732.617] AND THEY TRUST THAT HE’LL DO IT.
[ct=4736.335] >> Joe: THIRD LIONS SACK OF THE
[ct=4736.335] NIGHT.
[ct=4738.470] JACKSON, INCOMPLETE FOR BATEMAN
[ct=4739.106] WHO GETS HIT BY BRANCH.
[ct=4744.836] SO, AFTER THE KICKOFF OUT OF
[ct=4746.989] BOUNDS AND FIELD POSITION AT
[ct=4748.169] THEIR OWN 40, THE RAVENS DON’T
[ct=4749.331] DO ANYTHING WITH IT AND A PUNT
[ct=4751.134] IS NEXT.
[ct=4753.800] >> Troy: IT’S NOT EASY TO DO FOR
[ct=4754.385] THIS DEFENSE.
[ct=4756.100] GIVEN THAT KIND OF FIELD
[ct=4757.767] POSITION, AND FORCE A THREE AND
[ct=4759.325] OUT AND GET THE BALL BACK TO
[ct=4760.487] YOUR OFFENSE, THAT’S WELL DONE.
[ct=4765.579] >> Joe: JORDAN STOUT WILL PUNT
[ct=4766.400] IT WITH KALIF RAYMOND WAITING
[ct=4772.777] RAYMOND AVERAGING ABOUT 7 1/2
[ct=4776.016] YARDS PER RETURN.
[ct=4780.545] STOUT HITS IT, BOOMING PUNT,
[ct=4782.157] RAYMOND THIS TIME LETS IT GO
[ct=4784.449] OVER HIS HEAD AND THIS TIME IT
[ct=4787.156] CHECKS UP CAN YOU NOT WATCHING T
[ct=4788.133] GAME WITH A COLD BEER?
[ct=4793.820] >> Joe: THIS IS NOT THE WORST
[ct=4793.820] STARTING FIELD POSITION FOR THE
[ct=4794.514] LIONS TONIGHT.
[ct=4796.006] REMEMBER THEY STARTED INSIDE
[ct=4800.255] THEIR OWN 2 AND WENT 98 YARDS,
[ct=4801.377] 98 1/2 TO BE EXACT.
[ct=4804.686] >> Troy: WELL, THE WHOLE KEY IS
[ct=4804.686] GETTING THAT FIRST FIRST DOWN AS
[ct=4805.409] I TALKED ABOUT.
[ct=4807.580] GIVE ROOM FOR YOUR PUNTER, JACK
[ct=4809.142] FOX, IF YOU, YOU KNOW, YOU’RE
[ct=4811.293] NOT ABLE TO KEEP THE BALL, BUT
[ct=4813.147] THAT’S THE FIRST THING ON JARED
[ct=4814.235] GOFF’S MIND IS JUST TRYING TO
[ct=4815.160] GET A NEW SET OF DOWNS ON THIS
[ct=4817.486] POSSESSION.
[ct=4820.506] >> Joe: MONTGOMERY IS ABLE TO
[ct=4822.308] GET THROUGH, AND GET 11.
[ct=4826.211] STRONG RUN BY DAVID MONTGOMERY,
[ct=4829.375] AND A GOOD JOB YET AGAIN BY THIS
[ct=4831.746] RESHUFFLED OFFENSIVE LINE OF THE
[ct=4833.215] >> Troy: JUST WATCHED THEM COME
[ct=4834.184] OFF THE BALL AND THE JOB THEY
[ct=4834.763] DO.
[ct=4835.965] I MEAN, IT’S JUST EXCELLENT
[ct=4836.859] WORK.
[ct=4838.780] YOU GOT GUYS AND, AGAIN, SAM
[ct=4839.421] LaPORTA.
[ct=4841.072] WE HIGHLIGHTED HIM AND WHAT HE’S
[ct=4845.986] ABLE TO DO AND A BIG PART OF IT.
[ct=4849.159] >> Joe: SO THEY GET THAT
[ct=4850.243] BREATHING ROOM AND THE BALL
[ct=4853.015] SITTING AT THEIR OWN 15.
[ct=4858.737] MONTGOMERY STAYS IN.
[ct=4858.737] THEY FAKE IT TO HIM.
[ct=4861.424] THROW TO AMON-RA ST. BROWN.
[ct=4862.335] AND IT’S OUT OF HIS REACH.
[ct=4864.163] ONE OF THE RARE ERRANT THROWS BY
[ct=4865.056] GOFF ALL NIGHT.
[ct=4867.567] >> Troy: YEAH, THAT’S ONE HE’D
[ct=4868.610] PROBABLY LIKE TO HAVE BACK.
[ct=4871.589] GOING BACK TO THE OFFENSIVE
[ct=4871.868] LINE, HANK FRALEY PLAYED IN THE
[ct=4873.971] LEAGUE A LONG TIME AND BEEN A
[ct=4874.580] LONGTIME COACH AS WELL.
[ct=4875.953] HE WAS HERE BEFORE DAN CAMPBELL
[ct=4876.588] IN DETROIT.
[ct=4879.016] THIS IS HIS EIGHTH YEAR AS THE
[ct=4881.239] OFFENSIVE LINE COACH WITH THE
[ct=4883.589] HE CAME IN WITH MATT PATRICIA
[ct=4884.265] BUT A QUALITY COACH.
[ct=4885.653] HE’S BEEN AROUND SOME GOOD
[ct=4887.618] OFFENSIVE MINDS, AND HE’S HAD
[ct=4890.446] HIS WORK CUT OUT FOR HIM THIS
[ct=4892.881] YEAR, AND HE’S GOT THEM PLAYING
[ct=4893.482] >> Joe: HERE’S ANOTHER GOOD RUN
[ct=4893.888] BY MONTGOMERY.
[ct=4899.234] HE IS OUT BEING CHASED BY
[ct=4901.327] HUMPHREY, AND BROUGHT DOWN NEAR
[ct=4901.327] THE 15.
[ct=4915.304] WHAT A RUN BY DAVID MONTGOMERY
[ct=4918.497] BEHIND THAT OFFENSIVE LINE, AND
[ct=4918.497] A BIG PLAY HERE TONIGHT.
[ct=4920.984] >> Troy: YEAH, JUST AN EXCELLENT
[ct=4921.845] JOB UP FRONT.
[ct=4924.944] YOU GOT THE RIGHT GUARD ROOKIE
[ct=4926.933] TATE RATLEDGE AND PENEI SEWELL
[ct=4929.596] ALONG WITH SAM LaPORTA, AND IT’S
[ct=4932.011] JUST EXCELLENT BLOCKING ON THAT
[ct=4933.486] SIDE AND THEN
[ct=4936.385] THE CREASE, IS ABLE TO MAKE A
[ct=4938.121] GUY MISS AND OFF AND RUNNING.
[ct=4940.924] >> Joe: 72 YARDS, THIRD LONGEST
[ct=4942.498] RUN OF THE CAREER OF DAVID
[ct=4944.559] MONTGOMERY, NOW, GIBBS.
[ct=4949.534] THAT BALTIMORE DEFENSE HAS TO BE
[ct=4951.647] A BIT WINDED ESPECIALLY MARLON
[ct=4952.816] HUMPHREY WHO HAD TO COME OUT
[ct=4954.584] AFTER CHASING MONTGOMERY DOWN
[ct=4954.958] THE FIELD AND DAVID IS COMING
[ct=4955.352] BACK IN.
[ct=4959.251] AFTER GIBBS GETS FIVE.
[ct=4960.343] >> Troy: YOU LOOK AT THIS GAME
[ct=4962.192] AND THE WORST THE FIELD POSITION
[ct=4963.630] GETS FOR THE LIONS, THE BETTER
[ct=4965.307] THEY PLAY.
[ct=4967.537] YOU KNOW, THEY’RE BACKED UP
[ct=4970.341] INSIDE THE 5 AND I’VE SAID IT,
[ct=4974.366] YOU JUST TRY TO GET A NEW SET OF
[ct=4974.673] DOWNS AND NEXT THING THEY’RE
[ct=4975.282] INSIDE THE 10 YARD LINE LOOKING
[ct=4982.533] >> Joe: BOTH BACKS IN THERE.
[ct=4985.314] GOFF, LaPORTA, GOOD TACKLE.
[ct=4990.140] THAT PLAY MADE BY KEYON MARTIN,
[ct=4994.352] WHO IS A ROOKIE, AND A TRYOUT
[ct=4994.623] PLAYER THAT JUST OPENED THEIR
[ct=4996.869] EYES, FORCED HIS WAY ONTO THE
[ct=4998.334] TEAM AND MADE A NICE TACKLE
[ct=4999.198] IT’S THIRD DOWN AND FOUR.
[ct=5001.924] >> Troy: WELL, THIS HAS BEEN ONE
[ct=5003.104] HECK OF A BALL GAME.
[ct=5005.496] IT’S A HEAVYWEIGHT FIGHT
[ct=5008.145] WEEK THREE, AND WE TALKED ABOUT
[ct=5009.863] IT BEING A MEASURING STICK TO
[ct=5012.353] SEE WHERE THESE TEAMS WERE AFTER
[ct=5014.449] SOME DISAPPOINTING WEEK ONE
[ct=5016.446] LOSSES AND THEY JUST CONTINUE TO
[ct=5018.979] EXCHANGE BLOWS.
[ct=5019.651] >> Joe: THIRD DOWN AND FOUR.
[ct=5020.157] PLAY CLOCK IS AT 5.
[ct=5029.949] TIME-OUT TAKEN BY DAN CAMPBELL,
[ct=5033.930] WHO WAS SAUNTERING DOWN BELIEVE
[ct=5036.147] INSURANCE AND FINANCIAL NEEDS.
[ct=5036.147] NATIONWIDE IS ON
[ct=5040.735] >> Joe: PLAY CLOCK WAS EXPIRING
[ct=5042.935] SO DAN CAMPBELL HAD TO USE HIS
[ct=5044.972] FIRST TIME-OUT OF THE HALF.
[ct=5047.438] 90 YARDS OVER FIVE PLAY, THE
[ct=5048.853] 72-YARD RUN BY MONTGOMERY AND
[ct=5049.890] NOW IT’S THIRD AND FOUR.
[ct=5052.763] >> Troy: YOU’VE GOT TO BELIEVE
[ct=5054.337] DAN CAMPBELL HAS TOLD JOHNNIE
[ct=5056.028] MORTON HE HAS TWO DOWNS TO PICK
[ct=5057.050] IT UP IF THEY DON’T GET IT ON
[ct=5058.853] THIRD.
[ct=5059.917] AS AGGRESSIVE AS DAN CAMPBELL TO
[ct=5060.893] START THE GAME CAN’T IMAGINE HE
[ct=5062.372] WOULDN’T BE HERE.
[ct=5065.299] HIS KNEE WENT DOWN AND HE DIDN’T
[ct=5070.694] IT’S GOING TO BE FOURTH DOWN AND
[ct=5072.841] IF THE LIONS WANT TO LET THE
[ct=5075.366] QUARTER EXPIRE AND PICK THIS UP
[ct=5078.700] IN THE FOURTH, THEY CAN BUT
[ct=5080.688] RIGHT NOW THEY’RE HURRYING BACK
[ct=5083.072] THEY DID NOT SUBSTITUTE.
[ct=5083.703] THEY CAN GO RIGHT
[ct=5085.506] CENTER.
[ct=5085.794] >> Troy: I WOULD THINK THEY’D
[ct=5087.089] WANT TO TAKE IT TO THE 4.
[ct=5098.259] >> Joe: AND THAT’S WHERE WE GO.
[ct=5104.921] R, FOURTH
[ct=5106.933] DOWN AND THE SEVENTH PLAY OF
[ct=5108.169] THIS DRIVE, IT STARTED BACK AT
[ct=5111.088] THE 4.
[ct=5117.039] >> Troy: THIS IS WHEN IF YOU’RE
[ct=5117.717] THE BALTIMORE RAVENS YOU SURE
[ct=5120.494] WISH YOU HAD NNAMDI MADUBUIKE IN
[ct=5121.942] THE LINEUP.
[ct=5122.620] >> Joe: HE’S OUT WITH A BAD
[ct=5124.070] NECK.
[ct=5126.255] THEY HAVE NO IDEA HOW LONG HE
[ct=5126.255] WILL BE OUT.
[ct=5130.114] TWO PRO BOWLERS NOT OUT THERE
[ct=5130.394] FOR THE RAVENS, FOURTH AND ONE.
[ct=5137.954] THEY PITCH TO GIBBS, TOUCHDOWN!
[ct=5148.519] THEY WENT FROM GOFF TO AMON-RA
[ct=5152.314] ST. BROWN AND HE PITCHED IT TO
[ct=5154.240] GIBBS, AND LIKE BEN JOHNSON
[ct=5154.892] WOULD CALL.
[ct=5157.345] >> Joe: IT WAS A GADGET PLAY AND
[ct=5159.654] BOY, WAS THAT A THING OF BEAUTY.
[ct=5161.411] >> Troy: WE’VE SEEN JOHNNIE
[ct=5163.214] MORTON DIAL UP A COUPLE OF THESE
[ct=5163.766] GOOD EXECUTION.
[ct=5165.121] THEY GET IT TO ST. BROWN THEN HE
[ct=5166.963] PITCHES IT OUT TO JAHMYR GIBBS
[ct=5167.512] TO GET HIM ON THE EDGE WITH THE
[ct=5167.929] SPEED.
[ct=5172.492] THERE’S A GOOD LOOK AT JOHNNIE
[ct=5174.613] MORTON.
[ct=5176.267] HE HAD A HECK OF A GAME PLAN
[ct=5177.792] LAST WEEK IN THAT BIG WIN
[ct=5179.488] AGAINST CHICAGO AND TONIGHT HERE
[ct=5181.369] ON THE ROAD A LOT OF QUESTIONS
[ct=5183.513] WERE GOING TO BE ANSWERED, AND
[ct=5185.004] IF THERE WERE ANY OUT THERE ON
[ct=5185.715] HIM, HE’S ANSWERED THOSE AS
[ct=5191.541] >> Joe: UP BY SEVEN.
[ct=5192.764] BEFORE TONIGHT THE LAST TIME THE
[ct=5195.546] RAVENS ALLOWED A 95-YARD
[ct=5198.120] TOUCHDOWN IN BALTIMORE WAS IN
[ct=5199.838] 2001.
[ct=5201.968] THE LIONS HAVE DONE IT TWICE
[ct=5206.291] AMAZING.
[ct=5207.003] 72-YARD RUN BY DAVID MONTGOMERY
[ct=5207.373] GOT THEM DOWN THERE.
[ct=5208.367] LONGEST RUN IN THE NFL THIS
[ct=5209.935] SEASON.
[ct=5210.419] WHAT A GAME.
[ct=5212.474] GIBBS HAS GOT ANOTHER AND THE
[ct=5215.097] LIONS BACK UP GET TWO MONTHS FR
[ct=5216.012] CODE TV.
[ct=5219.613] >> OH YEAH.
[ct=5221.471] >> Troy: TAKE A LOOK AT THIS
[ct=5223.824] HANDOFF HERE BY JARED GOFF.
[ct=5225.309] AS HE GIVES IT TO AMON-RA ST.
[ct=5226.600] BROWN, IT’S VERTICAL AND THE
[ct=5228.231] REASON FOR THAT IS THEN HE’S
[ct=5229.383] ABLE TO JUST PITCH IT.
[ct=5230.896] IT’S ALREADY IN A POSITION THAT
[ct=5233.810] HE NEEDS IT TO BE IN TO PITCH IT
[ct=5235.229] QUICKLY, THEY’RE WORKING OFF
[ct=5237.098] MIKE GREEN BUT THAT’S JUST
[ct=5239.017] DETAIL IN THE EXECUTION AND IT’S
[ct=5242.745] AN EXCELLENT JOB BY JOHN MORTON
[ct=5244.830] WHEN HE PUT THAT PLAY IN AND
[ct=5246.938] HAVING ALL THE FINER POINTS OF
[ct=5246.938] IT DETAILED OUT.
[ct=5251.265] >> Joe: RASHEEN ALI RETURNED IT,
[ct=5253.625] AND THEN GOT TACKLED UP HIGH ON
[ct=5255.830] THE SIDELINE.
[ct=5259.701] NO FLAG AND IT’S RAVENS BALL
[ct=5264.514] DOWN SEVEN AS ROCK YA-SIN MADE
[ct=5265.600] THAT STOP AND HERE’S THE RAVENS
[ct=5267.536] OFFENSE BACK OUT THERE BACK DOWN
[ct=5268.244] BY SEVEN POINTS.
[ct=5271.342] >> Troy: NOW IT’S THE RAVENS’
[ct=5272.519] OPPORTUNITY TO SEE IF THEY CAN
[ct=5273.545] MATCH THE BLOW THEY JUST TOOK.
[ct=5277.070] JUST ANOTHER GREAT DRIVE.
[ct=5279.551] JOHN MORTON HAS REALLY DONE AN
[ct=5280.237] EXCELLENT JOB.
[ct=5283.215] A GUY WHO WAS PICKED,
[ct=5284.216] ANTICIPATING HE MIGHT LOSE BEN
[ct=5285.003] JOHNSON.
[ct=5286.629] HE WAS ALWAYS THE GUY THAT DAN
[ct=5287.097] CAMPBELL HAD IN MIND.
[ct=5293.303] >> Joe: JACKSON BREAKING
[ct=5293.649] TACKLES, ANZALONE WON’T LET HIM
[ct=5295.783] GO, ANZALONE IS CELEBRATING HIS
[ct=5297.638] 31st BIRTHDAY TODAY, TRYING TO
[ct=5299.684] HELP GET A WIN HERE TO GET THEIR
[ct=5299.684] RECORD TO 2-1.
[ct=5303.099] BEEN A GOOD PLAYER FOR A LONG
[ct=5303.513] TIME IN HIS NINTH YEAR.
[ct=5305.375] SECOND DOWN AND SEVEN.
[ct=5308.103] >> Troy: I THINK THESE
[ct=5309.391] LINEBACKERS FOR DETROIT ARE
[ct=5312.476] REALLY GOOD, AND WE’VE SEEN A
[ct=5315.538] LOT OF BARNES TONIGHT, BECAUSE
[ct=5317.929] THE LIONS HAVE PLAYED A LOT OF
[ct=5319.529] BASE DEFENSE MATCHING THE
[ct=5321.595] PERSONNEL THAT THEY’VE GOTTEN
[ct=5321.918] FROM THE BALTIMORE RAVENS.
[ct=5326.238] >> Joe: SECOND AND SEVEN,
[ct=5328.126] JACKSON OUT TO HIS RIGHT, THROWS
[ct=5328.412] IT AWAY.
[ct=5331.458] WAS TOO HIGH FOR FLOWERS.
[ct=5333.607] THAT ONE GOT AWAY.
[ct=5333.991] FLOWERS WAS OPEN.
[ct=5334.946] AS HE WORKED AGAINST D.J. REED.
[ct=5340.338] >> Troy: THIRD DOWN AND SEVEN
[ct=5343.409] AND, YOU KNOW, BALTIMORE HASN’T
[ct=5343.680] HAD NEAR AS MANY OF THEM.
[ct=5345.799] SEVEN THIRD DOWNS TONIGHT AND
[ct=5347.525] CONVERTED FOUR OF THEM BUT NOW
[ct=5348.674] WOULD BE A GOOD TIME TO CONVERT
[ct=5349.015] THEIR FIFTH.
[ct=5352.983] >> Joe: KELVIN SHEPPARD, FIRST
[ct=5353.793] YEAR DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR.
[ct=5356.489] PLAYED FOR THE LIONS, WAS AN
[ct=5357.051] EIGHT-YEAR LINEBACKER IN THE
[ct=5361.880] THIRD DOWN, SEVEN YARDS.
[ct=5369.756] JACKSON OVER THE MIDDLE.
[ct=5371.858] HE’S GOT BATEMAN, FIRST DOWN.
[ct=5378.560] PERFECT FLOW,
[ct=5380.160] PERFECT THROW, 19 YARDS AND INTO
[ct=5381.888] LIONS TERRITORY GO THE RAVENS.
[ct=5382.995] >> Troy: TYLAN WALLACE, NUMBER
[ct=5384.396] 16 GOES THROUGH THE DEFENSE AND
[ct=5385.605] CLEARS OUT A DEFENDER AND JUST
[ct=5387.557] OPENS IT UP.
[ct=5389.638] WATCH TYLAN WALLACE AND THE
[ct=5391.727] IMPACT THAT HE THEN LAST ON
[ct=5392.988] BRANCH AT THE SAFETY AND THEN
[ct=5395.226] THAT OPENS IT UP IN BEHIND FOR
[ct=5396.125] BATEMAN TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THE
[ct=5400.994] IT’S A GOOD DESIGN AND EXCELLENT
[ct=5401.589] JOB BY LAMAR JACKSON JUST
[ct=5405.813] READING IT OUT.
[ct=5414.466] >> Joe: TOSS TO HENRY.
[ct=5418.759] AND A PRETTY GOOD TACKLE BY JACK
[ct=5420.477] THERE’S A FLAG DOWN OUT ON THE
[ct=5427.312] CAMPBELL’S BEEN DEALING WITH A
[ct=5429.512] BLOODY MOUTH MOST OF THE NIGHT.
[ct=5431.521] >> Referee: DEFENSE, NUMBER 32.
[ct=5433.939] 15-YARD PENALTY, FIRST DOWN.
[ct=5436.081] >> Joe: IT’S AGAINST BRIAN
[ct=5436.081] BRANCH.
[ct=5445.140] >> Troy: HERE HE IS RIGHT HERE
[ct=5446.338] IN THE -- YOUR SCREEN.
[ct=5448.487] YOU CAN’T -- YEAH, I DON’T
[ct=5448.883] KNOW -- I DON’T KNOW.
[ct=5451.236] I’LL LEAVE THAT TO YOU, RUSSELL.
[ct=5451.841] >> Russell: I DON’T SEE A
[ct=5453.312] PENALTY THERE.
[ct=5454.895] I THINK HE INITIATED CONTACT.
[ct=5455.313] I DON’T LIKE THAT AS A FOUL.
[ct=5457.784] >> Joe: THAT’S A BIG CALL THAT
[ct=5460.041] TAKES THE BALL INSIDE THE
[ct=5461.560] DETROIT 32.
[ct=5479.228] IT’S HOT.
[ct=5481.138] >> THAT’LL MAK
[ct=5481.784] >> Joe: THAT’LL MAKE IT FIRST
[ct=5483.994] AND 15 AS KOLAR JUMPED.
[ct=5485.982] >> Referee: OFFENSE, NUMBER 88.
[ct=5486.258] FIVE-YARD PENALTY, STILL FIRST
[ct=5489.820] >> Joe: LET’S GO DOWN TO LAURA.
[ct=5492.505] LAURA
[ct=5494.613] >> Laura: YOU POINTED OUT THE
[ct=5495.862] BANDAGE ON JACK CAMPBELL’S LIP.
[ct=5497.025] HE HAD A SPLIT CUT ON HIS LIP.
[ct=5499.561] THEY WORKED ON IT FOR AWHILE.
[ct=5500.150] CREDIT TO GET THE BLEEDING TO
[ct=5502.827] THEY ADDED A FACE SHIELD TO HIS
[ct=5504.284] HELMET AND THIS IS THE HIT WHERE
[ct=5504.792] IT HAPPENED.
[ct=5506.282] HE’S BEEN DEALING WITH A LOT OF
[ct=5508.987] PAIN AND BLOOD ON THE SIDELINE.
[ct=5511.388] >> Joe: IT WAS A HIT
[ct=5513.437] JUSTICE HILL PLAYING THROUGH IT,
[ct=5513.775] FIRST DOWN AND 15.
[ct=5520.271] >> Troy: THEY GOT MAN COVERAGE
[ct=5522.000] ACROSS THE BOARD.
[ct=5526.163] >> Joe: PASS IS UNDERTHROWN.
[ct=5527.285] JACKSON WAS UNDER PRESSURE AND
[ct=5530.506] HOPKINS WAS THE TARGET.
[ct=5533.017] AS TYLER LACY HAD PRESSURE ON
[ct=5535.051] LAMAR JACKSON.
[ct=5536.578] HE WAS PICKED UP OFF WAIVERS
[ct=5537.552] FROM THE JAGUARS.
[ct=5538.958] >> Troy: YEAH, THE LIONS ARE
[ct=5540.110] GOING TO COME AFTER YOU AND YOU
[ct=5541.153] CAN TELL BY THE WAY THEY WERE
[ct=5542.208] POSITIONED WITH THE DEFENSIVE
[ct=5543.572] BACKS THAT THEY WERE LOCKED UP
[ct=5544.956] IN MAN COVERAGE AND HERE THEY
[ct=5547.789] WERE COMING AND SO A GOOD JOB BY
[ct=5549.906] THEM, FORCE THE BALL OUT OF
[ct=5552.201] LAMAR JACKSON’S HANDS AND SEE IF
[ct=5552.544] THEY CAN’T COVER FOR THE TIME
[ct=5555.011] THAT IT TAKES FOR HIM TO GET IT
[ct=5557.754] OUT AND MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.
[ct=5571.513] >> Joe: JACKSON, WIDE OPEN.
[ct=5572.661] FIRST DOWN, RAVENS.
[ct=5574.464] BATEMAN AGAIN.
[ct=5581.523] AND 16 YARDS FROM LAMAR JACKSON.
[ct=5583.618] >> Troy: WELL, AGAIN, THEY’RE
[ct=5585.787] TRYING TO DISGUISE, THEY’LL SHOW
[ct=5587.368] THEY’RE ALL COMING UP HERE AND
[ct=5588.419] YOU GOT BRIAN BRANCH WHO IS
[ct=5592.332] GOING TO RUN TO A TWO DEEP LOOK,
[ct=5593.919] AND AS HE’S RUNNING OUT OF THERE
[ct=5594.851] IT OPENS UP.
[ct=5596.663] YOU SEE JUST HOW MUCH SPACE
[ct=5599.049] THERE IS THEN FOR THESE
[ct=5599.673] RECEIVERS, AND BATEMAN JUST SITS
[ct=5603.606] RIGHT DOWN IN THE HOLE AND NICE
[ct=5605.748] COMPLETION.
[ct=5608.954] >> Joe: JACKSON WANTED TO TAKE
[ct=5608.954] OFF.
[ct=5611.942] AND HE IS BROUGHT TO THE GROUND
[ct=5617.120] AND A GOOD PLAY BY DJ READER.
[ct=5618.110] DEALT WITH A QUAD INJURY.
[ct=5621.351] THEY WOULD LOVE TO SEE DJ READER
[ct=5625.148] GET BACK TO THE BENGALS DJ
[ct=5626.669] READER THEY SIGNED AS AN
[ct=5629.803] UNRESTRICTED FREE AGENT AND
[ct=5631.698] HEALTH WILL MAYBE GET HIM THERE.
[ct=5632.266] >> Troy: THEY’RE RELYING ON A
[ct=5634.178] LOT OF GUYS ESPECIALLY THIS YEAR
[ct=5635.864] WITH MARCUS DAVENPORT GOING DOWN
[ct=5637.174] AGAIN AND THEY HAD LOOKED AT
[ct=5639.461] MAYBE BRINGING IN ANOTHER EDGE
[ct=5642.169] RUSHER, BUT FELT THE DEPTH WAS
[ct=5643.561] MORE IMPORTANT WITH ALL THE
[ct=5645.972] INJURIES THEY WENT THROUGH LAST
[ct=5647.065] >> Joe: SECOND DOWN AND NINE
[ct=5647.483] NOW.
[ct=5650.654] JACKSON, ONE-ON-ONE AND THAT
[ct=5656.808] LITTLE BATTLE WAS WON BY
[ct=5659.026] NOWASKE.
[ct=5659.310] THEY BLEW IT DEAD.
[ct=5661.381] NOT A FUMBLE AND TREVOR NOWASKE
[ct=5662.011] DIDN’T FLINCH AND BROUGHT HIM
[ct=5663.944] >> Troy: HE DID NOT.
[ct=5666.181] HE HUNG IN THERE AND WAS ABLE TO
[ct=5667.149] MAKE A GOOD TACKLE.
[ct=5668.404] NOT MANY GUYS ARE ABLE TO DO
[ct=5669.941] THAT ON LAMAR JACKSON.
[ct=5676.693] >> Joe: YOU SEE, HE’S KIND OF IN
[ct=5678.209] A SPYTEK SNEAK AND AS LAMAR
[ct=5680.169] STARTS TO TRY TO SCRAMBLE UP IN
[ct=5681.197] THE LINE, BOY, HE WAS RIGHT
[ct=5681.626] THERE TO MAKE A PLAY.
[ct=5687.211] >> Joe: AND A LOSS OF FOUR.
[ct=5689.981] THAT’S THE FOURTH LIONS SACK AND
[ct=5691.561] FOR NOWASKE HIS FIRST OF THE
[ct=5693.624] YEAR AND IT’S THIRD AND 13.
[ct=5707.488] >> Joe: JACKSON TRYING TO FIND
[ct=5708.003] SOMEWHERE TO GO.
[ct=5711.214] TIME RUNS OUT.
[ct=5712.047] AND TRIPPED UP BY BARNES.
[ct=5719.899] AND LAMAR JACKSON WAS ONE GUY
[ct=5722.346] AWAY FROM GETTING OUT OF THERE
[ct=5722.721] AND DERRICK BARNES SAVED
[ct=5725.584] KELVIN SHEPPARD LOVING EVERY
[ct=5727.011] SECOND OF IT.
[ct=5727.728] >> Troy: AND DERRICK BARNES
[ct=5728.792] INITIALLY GOES TO COVERAGE.
[ct=5731.045] HE GOES OUT AND HE’S JUST KIND
[ct=5732.386] OF WATCHING WITH HIS EYES.
[ct=5734.370] HE’S WAITING FOR SOMEBODY TO
[ct=5734.958] COME IN HIGGS AREA.
[ct=5736.750] A FOUR-MAN RUSH.
[ct=5737.508] WHEN HE SEES LAMAR START TO
[ct=5739.202] MOVE, HE COMES IN AND MAKES A
[ct=5741.742] PLAY AND IF HE DOESN’T DO THAT
[ct=5745.644] INSTINCTIVE ON HIS PART THERE
[ct=5745.919] WAS NOBODY OUT IN FRONT OF
[ct=5748.157] >> Joe: SACK NUMBER FIVE TONIGHT
[ct=5748.873] FOR THE LIONS DEFENSE.
[ct=5754.377] A 41-YARD TRY BY TYLER LOOP.
[ct=5761.087] HE GOT IT.
[ct=5763.959] LOOKED LIKE IT WENT OVER THE TOP
[ct=5764.427] OF THE UPRIGHT.
[ct=5771.567] AND THE FIELD GOAL IS GOOD.
[ct=5771.887] THAT WAS CLOSE.
[ct=5773.903] 28-24.
[ct=5777.585] LOOP PUTS HIS FOOT INTO IT.
[ct=5783.307] AND IT’S A FOUR-POINT GAME IN
[ct=5783.617] BALTIMORE.
[ct=5786.002] INSIDE THE OUTSIDE EDGE.
[ct=5789.980] IT’S HARD TO TELL FOR SURE.
[ct=5789.980] THAT’S WHY IT’S
[ct=5792.465] >> Joe: SO THE FIELD GOAL WAS
[ct=5794.575] AND THIS IS A FOUR-
[ct=5796.617] WITH THE LIONS ABOUT TO GET IT
[ct=5797.375] BACK WITH UNDER TEN TO GO.
[ct=5813.607] RETURNED BY SAYLORS.
[ct=5815.650] BENDS IT BACK AND GETS OUT TO
[ct=5818.040] THE 35.
[ct=5819.921] IF YOU’RE DESIGNING SUCCESS,
[ct=5820.722] IT’S BROUGHT TO YOU BY KFC AND A
[ct=5822.126] LOOK AT THE GROUND GAME AND THE
[ct=5823.210] LIONS IN THIS ONE.
[ct=5824.453] >> Troy: THE MOST IMPRESSIVE
[ct=5825.970] THING IS THAT JOHN MORTON HAS
[ct=5827.291] STUCK WITH IT AND SOME OF THESE
[ct=5828.560] RUNS AND THEY START TO BREAK BUT
[ct=5830.036] WHEN YOU’RE PLAYING AGAINST THE
[ct=5832.141] RAVENS, WHAT YOU GOT TO DO, THIS
[ct=5833.409] OFFENSIVE LINE I THINK HAS DONE
[ct=5834.405] A GOOD JOB.
[ct=5837.078] HERE’S THE BIG 72-YARDER BY
[ct=5837.864] DAVID MONTGOMERY AND THEN THE
[ct=5841.002] TOUCHDOWN WITH THE TRICKERY,
[ct=5841.288] SECOND ONE THAT WE SAW IN THIS
[ct=5844.505] GAME, BOTH OF THEM SUCCESSFUL.
[ct=5845.581] JUST THINK THE JOB THAT JOHN
[ct=5847.140] MORTON IS THE PLAY CALLER
[ct=5850.601] STICKING WITH IT, 29 RUNS, 23
[ct=5852.932] PASSES, AGAINST THIS DEFENSE, HE
[ct=5856.281] PLAYED THE GAME YOU GOT TO PLAY.
[ct=5857.590] >> Joe: LIONS ARE OVERSEVEN
[ct=5859.548] YARDS PER RUSH AND, TROY, AS YOU
[ct=5861.441] SAID, THAT 72-YARDER BY
[ct=5862.761] MONTGOMERY INFLATES THOSE
[ct=5864.330] NUMBERS BUT STILL THE IMPRESSIVE
[ct=5867.418] THING IS THAT JOHN MORTON IS
[ct=5868.110] STUCK WITH IT EVEN WHEN AT TIMES
[ct=5870.269] IT LOOKED LIKE THIS WASN’T MUCH
[ct=5872.898] ROOM IN THERE AS GIBBS GETS BY.
[ct=5874.594] >> Troy: WHAT ALLOWS YOU TO DO
[ct=5879.239] CONVERTING THEN ON THIRD DOWN,
[ct=5881.420] AND DETROIT HAS BEEN REALLY GOOD
[ct=5882.586] ON THIRD DOWN TONIGHT, SO THEN
[ct=5884.485] THEY GET A NEW SET OF DOWNS THEN
[ct=5885.654] THEY’RE ABLE TO RUN THE FOOTBALL
[ct=5887.761] A COUPLE OF TIMES MORE, SO
[ct=5888.232] THEY’VE BEEN ABLE TO LEAN ON
[ct=5891.319] THAT A LITTLE BIT AND KIND OF
[ct=5893.461] TAKE THE FIGHT TO THIS RAVENS
[ct=5897.021] >> Joe: PLAY ACTION HERE AS GOFF
[ct=5899.133] LETS IT GO AND WHAT A GOOD PLAY.
[ct=5902.600] TeSLAA WAS THE TARGET AND NATE
[ct=5903.390] WIGGINS GOT HIS HAND IN THERE
[ct=5904.810] AND KNOCKED IT AWAY.
[ct=5905.232] GOOD EFFORT.
[ct=5909.980] THIRD DOWN.
[ct=5910.275] >> Troy: ROQUAN SMITH, HE’S THE
[ct=5913.683] ONE WHO BLITZES AND GETS IN THE
[ct=5916.295] FACE OF JARED GOFF, HE COMES A
[ct=5916.577] LITTLE LATE.
[ct=5918.020] BUT THERE’S THE ONE-ON-ONE
[ct=5919.544] MATCHUP AND WIGGINS DOES AN
[ct=5921.594] EXCELLENT JOB IN COVERAGE,
[ct=5922.467] LOCKED UP MAN-TO-MAN HERE’S
[ct=5924.386] ANOTHER LOOK AT ROQUAN SMITH,
[ct=5925.496] BUT THEY KNOW WHAT’S AT STAKE.
[ct=5927.049] BIG THIRD DOWN HERE.
[ct=5931.980] >> Joe: THIRD DOWN AND FIVE.
[ct=5942.670] PLAY CLOCK IS AT ZERO AND THAT’S
[ct=5943.022] A FLAG.
[ct=5947.168] NOW THE OFFICIAL IS RUNNING IN.
[ct=5950.192] HOLD ON A SECOND.
[ct=5951.616] MAYBE THE SIDELINE GOT THE
[ct=5951.616] TIME-OUT CALLED.
[ct=5954.086] >> Referee: PRIOR TO THE PLAY
[ct=5956.015] CLOCK EXPIRING DETROIT CALLED
[ct=5960.590] THE SECOND CHARGED TIME-OUT.
[ct=5960.930] >> Joe: SO THEY’LL PICK UP THE
[ct=5961.773] FLAGS AND IT WAS DAN CAMPBELL ON
[ct=5963.091] THE SIDELINE THAT CALLED IT.
[ct=5965.566] BUT THE PLAY CLOCK JUST ABOUT TO
[ct=5966.494] HIT ZERO.
[ct=5968.364] >> Troy: IT’S A GREAT JOB BY DAN
[ct=5970.205] CAMPBELL JUST, YOU KNOW, PAYING
[ct=5971.636] ATTENTION AND THEN BEING QUICK
[ct=5973.093] TO CALL THE TIME-OUT.
[ct=5974.586] I WOULD HAVE -- I’VE NEVER BEEN
[ct=5976.292] A HEAD COACH THAT HAD TO DO IT
[ct=5977.805] BUT HERE YOU ARE TRYING TO
[ct=5978.786] FIGURE OUT IS HE GOING TO GET
[ct=5979.665] THE BALL OFF?
[ct=5981.359] IS HE NOT GOING TO GET THE BALL
[ct=5983.127] OFF AND YOU’RE TRYING TO DECIDE
[ct=5984.689] THAT AS THE HEAD COACH AND HE
[ct=5987.344] DOES IT JUST IN TIME.
[ct=5990.539] TRYING TO GET IT SNAPPED BUT
[ct=5991.400] EVERYONE ELSE HAS THEIR HEAD
[ct=5992.833] DOWN AND SEES THE PLAY CLOCK
[ct=5995.083] GOING DOWN BUT A BIG THIRD DOWN
[ct=5998.713] EVEN WITH 8:48 TO GO, IF THE
[ct=6000.885] LIONS CONVERT HERE, THERE’S A
[ct=6001.176] GOOD CHANCE THEY’RE COMING AWAY
[ct=6001.746] WITH POINTS.
[ct=6003.488] IF THEY CAN COME AWAY WITH A
[ct=6005.161] TOUCHDOWN ON THIS DRIVE THEY GOT
[ct=6006.067] A CHANCE TO PUT A BOW ON THIS
[ct=6013.655] >> Joe: QUICK SNAP, GOFF STEPS
[ct=6016.988] THROUGH, THROWS, INCOMPLETE,
[ct=6019.248] FOURTH DOWN.
[ct=6020.840] IT WAS SOME ROOM IN FRONT OF
[ct=6022.715] JARED GOFF BUT HE CUT IT LOOSE
[ct=6024.165] INSTEAD OF TRYING TO PICK IT UP
[ct=6025.333] WITH HIS LEGS.
[ct=6027.510] >> Troy: YEAH, HE HAD HIM TOO.
[ct=6029.430] IF HE -- THE DECISION WASN’T SO
[ct=6031.239] BAD, HE JUST WASN’T ABLE TO
[ct=6035.297] DELIVER THE CATCHABLE BALL.
[ct=6036.038] NOW, WHETHER OR NOT HE COULD
[ct=6037.521] HAVE PICKED IT UP WITH HIS LEGS,
[ct=6039.630] HE DIDN’T FEEL THAT HE COULD
[ct=6041.193] HAVE, WOULD HAVE BEEN CLOSE, BUT
[ct=6044.283] HE DID HAVE HIS GUY, IF HE MAKES
[ct=6044.866] A BETTER THROW FOR THE FIRST
[ct=6047.355] >> Joe: RAYMOND WAS THE TARGET.
[ct=6053.151] PASS TOO LOW AND NOW FOX HITS
[ct=6057.463] IT, NICE CATCH BY WESTER, MAKES
[ct=6059.120] A MOVE, AND ABLE TO GET ACROSS
[ct=6062.173] THE 20.RECAP IS
[ct=6065.919] BROUGHT TO YOU BY FIREBALL.
[ct=6067.157] AND IT WAS THAT SECOND QUARTER
[ct=6070.129] GOAL LINE STAND BY THIS LIONS
[ct=6072.512] THAT’S THE FOURTH DOWN PLAY
[ct=6074.642] WHERE THE BALL GOT KNOCKED OUT
[ct=6076.481] OF THE HAND OF LAMAR JACKSON BY
[ct=6077.258] JACK CAMPBELL.
[ct=6081.459] AND THIS DEFENSE LAST TIME THE
[ct=6083.144] RAVENS HAD IT CAME UP WITH TWO
[ct=6084.489] SACKS AND THEY HAVE FIVE SACKS
[ct=6089.865] THIS DRIVE STARTS AT THE 21 DOWN
[ct=6090.687] BY FOUR.
[ct=6092.898] HANDOFF TO HENRY AND HE GETS IT
[ct=6093.333] PUNCHED OUT.
[ct=6096.687] IT’S RECOVERED BY D.J. REED.
[ct=6098.113] KNOCKED OUT ON THE PLAY BY AIDAN
[ct=6098.400] HUTCHINSON.
[ct=6102.423] AND IT’S YET ANOTHER FUMBLE FOR
[ct=6103.495] DERRICK HENRY.
[ct=6117.564] HUTCHINSON KNOCKED IT OUT.
[ct=6119.954] AND THAT’S ONE FUMBLE PER GAME
[ct=6123.855] BY DERRICK HENRY AND IT WAS
[ct=6125.771] AIDAN HUTCHINSON RIGHT THERE
[ct=6127.451] THAT KNOCKED IT OUT OF THE LEFT
[ct=6128.641] ARM OF DERRICK HENRY.
[ct=6129.934] >> Troy: HE WAS UP THE FIELD.
[ct=6131.204] HE WAS TAKING CARE OF LAMAR
[ct=6134.855] JACKSON AND SO AS HE GETS UP THE
[ct=6136.997] FEEL BUT HE CONTINUES TO PLAY SO
[ct=6138.569] HE WORKS BACK, PURE EFFORT, ONCE
[ct=6139.364] HE PEELS BACK, HENRY DOESN’T
[ct=6141.036] KNOW HE’S PURSUING THE FOOTBALL
[ct=6141.957] AND THEN IS ABLE TO PUNCH IT
[ct=6146.004] OUT.
[ct=6148.009] >> Joe: IT WAS A CRUSHING FUMBLE
[ct=6148.691] THAT HE HAD IN WEEK ONE AT
[ct=6149.869] BUFFALO.
[ct=6151.379] THEY GOT THROUGH IT LAST WEEK.
[ct=6154.842] AND THIS ONE, HOW MUCH IS THIS
[ct=6157.382] GOING TO HURT AS THEY HAND TO
[ct=6159.142] MONTGOMERY?
[ct=6161.914] WITH UNDER 8:30 TO GO.
[ct=6168.311] HERE’S THE WEEK ONE FUMBLE IN
[ct=6170.421] THAT GAME AT THE BILLS.
[ct=6173.254] IT WAS PUNCHED OUT.
[ct=6175.800] THEY BLEW A FOURTH QUARTER LEAD
[ct=6177.165] WITH FOUR MINUTES TO PLAY AND
[ct=6179.590] LOST THAT BALL GAME, 41-40 AND
[ct=6181.108] NOW HERE TONIGHT, HUTCHINSON
[ct=6182.557] KNOCKS IT OUT OF HIS LEFT ARM
[ct=6186.015] AND D.J. REED RECOVERS.
[ct=6186.015] >> Troy: GREAT JOB BY HUTCHINSON
[ct=6187.102] JUST CONTINUING TO PLAY EVEN
[ct=6188.577] THOUGH IT LOOKED LIKE HE WAS OUT
[ct=6193.386] OF THE PLAY, JUST PURE EFFORT.
[ct=6196.970] >> Joe: MONTGOMERY RIGHT UP THE
[ct=6199.256] GUT, DOWN TO THE 5 AND A FLAG
[ct=6199.999] COMES IN AT THE END OF THE PLAY.
[ct=6205.905] >> Troy: RAVENS ARE SENATING IT
[ct=6207.800] WILL GO ON DETROIT WITH A HOLD.
[ct=6208.752] >> Joe: IT IS, GOING AGAINST
[ct=6209.662] THAT WAS THE INDICATION.
[ct=6212.402] >> Referee: PERSONAL FOUL.
[ct=6216.478] FACE MASK, OFFENSE, NUMBER 73,
[ct=6218.848] 15-YARD PENALTY, REPEAT SECOND
[ct=6221.243] >> Joe: THEY GET CHRISTIAN
[ct=6222.917] MAHOGANY, THE SECOND YEAR PRO
[ct=6228.564] FROM BOSTON COLLEGE AND BRENT
[ct=6230.354] URBAN IS THE ONE WHO HAD HIS
[ct=6231.812] FACE MASK GRABBED BY MAHOGANY.
[ct=6233.249] FRIDAY RIGHT HERE.
[ct=6239.133] AND INSTEAD OF FIRST AND GOAL
[ct=6239.415] THE BALL AT THE 5, THAT 15-
[ct=6241.435] PENALTY TAKES THE BALL BACK OUT
[ct=6241.435] TO THE 28.
[ct=6244.100] >> Troy: THAT CERTAINLY HELPS.
[ct=6247.963] TAKE A LOOK HERE AT DERRICK
[ct=6250.191] HENRY WITH THE FUMBLES THAT HAVE
[ct=6252.817] PLAGUED HIM THIS YEAR, BUT THIS
[ct=6254.211] DEFENSE, THEY’VE GOT TO BE ABLE
[ct=6255.275] TO MAKE A STOP.
[ct=6256.312] THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO MAKE
[ct=6258.311] A STOP IN THE RED ZONE TONIGHT,
[ct=6259.217] BUT THAT PENALTY SURE HELPS.
[ct=6262.684] >> Joe: SECOND AND 22 AS A
[ct=6263.170] RESULT.
[ct=6280.588] LET’S GO ACK TO THAT FUMBLE
[ct=6281.491] FORCED BY AIDAN HUTCHINSON ON
[ct=6282.741] THE CARRY BY HENRY.
[ct=6284.387] >> Troy: YOU SEE, HE’S WORRIED
[ct=6285.565] ABOUT LAMAR JACKSON AND HE COMES
[ct=6287.920] UP THE FIELD AND HE JUST
[ct=6290.689] CONTINUES TO PLAY AND IN BIG
[ct=6291.519] GAMES LIKE THIS YOU NEED YOUR
[ct=6293.979] GREAT PLAYERS TO SHOW UP BIG AND
[ct=6296.009] HE CERTAINLY DID.
[ct=6296.958] NOW, CAN THE RAVENS DEFENSIVELY
[ct=6300.424] DO THEIR PART TO KEEP THIS A
[ct=6302.875] ONE-POSSESSION GAME?
[ct=6304.277] >> Joe: THIRD DOWN AND 21.
[ct=6315.737] THIS ONE FLOATED FOR TeSLAA,
[ct=6317.591] INCOMPLETE, FOURTH DOWN AND ONE
[ct=6318.309] OTHER NOTE ON THE FUMBLES BY
[ct=6319.789] HENRY, IT’S THE FIRST TIME IN
[ct=6321.580] HIS TEN-YEAR CAREER HE’S HAD
[ct=6324.838] MULTIPLE FOURTH QUARTER FUMBLES
[ct=6326.474] LOST IN THE SAME SEASON AND
[ct=6329.423] WE’RE JUST IN WEEK THREE.
[ct=6331.603] >> Troy: WELL, I THINK IF YOU
[ct=6334.856] LOOK AT IT OR DERRICK HENRY,
[ct=6337.483] HE’S GOT TO GET THAT OUT OF HIS
[ct=6337.483] MIND AS QUICKLY AS HE CAN
[ct=6338.893] BECAUSE THEY’LL NEED HIM ON THIS
[ct=6340.171] NEXT POSSESSION.
[ct=6341.604] AFTER THE OPENING DRIVE HE
[ct=6343.160] REALLY HASN’T DONE ANYTHING.
[ct=6344.028] THE REST OF THE NIGHT AS FAR AS
[ct=6345.343] ON THE GROUND.
[ct=6348.811] >> Joe: 45-YARD TRY TO MAKE IT A
[ct=6349.616] SEVEN-POINT GAME AGAIN BY BATES.
[ct=6354.713] AND HE DRILLS IT.
[ct=6361.366] 31-24.
[ct=6364.271] AND HENRY AS TROY SAID IS GOING
[ct=6365.757] TO HAVE TO GO BACK TO WORK AND
[ct=6367.001] FORGET ABOUT THE FUMBLES.
[ct=6367.914] HE FRUSTRATED.
[ct=6370.481] WE SAW THIS IN BUFFALO AND WE
[ct=6372.122] SEE IT TONIGHT HERE AT HOME.
[ct=6373.906] SEVEN-POINT GAME.. DOLPHINS ON E
[ct=6377.400] BENGALS. BRONCOS ON ABC.
[ct=6382.511] >> Joe: EARLIER D.J. REED
[ct=6383.561] RECOVERS THE FUMBLE THAT WAS
[ct=6385.981] FORCED BY AIDAN HUTCHINSON AND
[ct=6386.583] THEY WERE READY.
[ct=6388.666] >> Troy: HE LOOKED LIKE OUR
[ct=6389.295] PRODUCER STEVE ROLLING
[ct=6390.787] BALL.
[ct=6390.787] >> Joe: ABSOLUTELY.
[ct=6395.008] >> Troy: BOWLING THAT NIGHT.
[ct=6395.290] >> Joe: HE IS TALENTED.
[ct=6396.148] >> Troy: HE IS A TALENT.
[ct=6399.231] >> Joe: HE’S OUR PRODUCER AND
[ct=6401.403] ARTIE OUR DIRECTOR WITH LISA
[ct=6403.462] SALTERS AND LAURA RUTLEDGE DOWN
[ct=6405.219] ON THE FIELD.
[ct=6408.373] TROY AND JOE UP IN THE BOOTH AND
[ct=6408.644] 6:30 TO GO.
[ct=6413.582] RASHEEN ALI TO RETURN ANOTHER
[ct=6415.811] KICK, AND HE’S BACK THERE WITH
[ct=6415.811] JUSTICE HILL.
[ct=6419.325] >> Troy: THE DEFENSE DID THEIR
[ct=6419.588] PART.
[ct=6422.160] THEY’VE GIVEN UP BIG DRIVES,
[ct=6423.964] LONG DRIVES FOR TOUCHDOWNS, BUT,
[ct=6425.609] MAN, THEY NEEDED HIM ON THAT
[ct=6426.047] LAST ONE AND THEY SHOWED UP.
[ct=6430.514] >> Joe: IT’S ALI FROM ABOUT THE
[ct=6430.903] 10.
[ct=6437.293] TO THE 31.
[ct=6440.349] AIDAN HUTCHINSON ANY TIME HE’S
[ct=6442.159] INVOLVED IN THE GAME, CAMERAS
[ct=6443.768] ARE ON HIM AS WE LOOK AT HIS
[ct=6445.846] EFFORT AND HIS EVENING TONIGHT.
[ct=6450.126] >> Troy: WELL, WE HEARD LAURA
[ct=6451.265] EARLIER TALK ABOUT HOW HE’S GOT
[ct=6451.682] THE GREEN LIGHT.
[ct=6453.225] HE CAN LINE UP WHERE HE WANTS
[ct=6457.600] AND KIND OF DO WHAT HE WANTS AND
[ct=6459.341] WITH THAT FLEXIBILITY WE’VE SEEN
[ct=6459.637] HIM TONIGHT LINE UP ON BOTH
[ct=6460.264] SIDES.
[ct=6462.236] HE TYPICALLY WOULD LINE UP ON
[ct=6463.693] THE DEFENSIVE LEFT AGAINST THE
[ct=6465.238] OFFENSIVE RIGHT TACKLE.
[ct=6467.099] THIS YEAR HE’S MIXING IT UP A
[ct=6469.220] LITTLE BIT MORE, BUT AS ALL
[ct=6470.381] GREAT PLAYERS DO, THEY SHOW UP
[ct=6470.811] AND MAKE
[ct=6473.720] NEED IT.
[ct=6474.420] AND HE DID ON THAT LAST DRIVE.
[ct=6477.714] >> Joe: LAMAR JACKSON, THERE HE
[ct=6478.086] IS.
[ct=6480.362] HUTCHINSON, SACK NUMBER SIX.
[ct=6482.255] FOR THE LIONS.
[ct=6486.798] THE FAMILY LOVES IT.
[ct=6488.681] MOM AND DAD LOVE IT AND A LOSS
[ct=6488.973] OF SIX ON THE PLAY.
[ct=6492.173] >> Troy: THIS TIME HE TAKES AN
[ct=6493.381] INSIDE MOVE AND YOU’LL SEE
[ct=6494.699] RONNIE STANLEY, THE LEFT TACKLE
[ct=6496.176] AS HE SLIDES OUT, THEY’RE MOVING
[ct=6497.305] PROTECTION THAT WAY TO TRY TO
[ct=6498.640] TAKE CARE OF HIM.
[ct=6501.317] AND YET HE TAKES AN INSIDE
[ct=6503.830] COUNTER MOVE AND THEN HAS A
[ct=6505.568] STRAIGHT SHOT ON LAMAR.
[ct=6511.893] >> Joe: NOW SECOND DOWN AND 16.
[ct=6516.108] HERE’S HILL.
[ct=6520.464] TERRION ARNOLD, FIRST TO GET TO
[ct=6524.856] THIRD DOWN COMING UP.
[ct=6529.700] YESTERDAY THE NFC NORTH WATCHED
[ct=6531.556] GREEN BAY SUFFER THEIR FIRST
[ct=6533.625] LOSS OF THE YEAR AS THEY BLEW
[ct=6534.426] THAT LATE LEAD AND LOST TO THE
[ct=6535.268] CLEVELAND BROWNS.
[ct=6538.729] SO, THEY GO TO 2-1.
[ct=6544.409] LIONS TRYING TO GET TO 2-1.
[ct=6545.067] SAME STORY FOR THE RAVENS,
[ct=6546.495] SEVEN-POINT GAME, THIRD DOWN AND
[ct=6562.217] JACKSON CAN’T FIND ANYWHERE TO
[ct=6564.062] GO AND HE’S BROUGHT DOWN AGAIN
[ct=6566.135] FROM BEHIND AND AGAIN IT’S
[ct=6566.871] AL-QUADIN MUHAMMAD.
[ct=6570.170] IT’LL GO DOWN AS A RUN.
[ct=6571.942] IT’S NOT A SACK BUT IT IS AN
[ct=6573.188] EFFECTIVE PLAY BY 96 AGAIN.
[ct=6575.686] >> Troy: YEAH, NO DOUBT, JOE.
[ct=6579.384] THE EFFORT THAT HE HAS SHOWN, I
[ct=6579.978] POINTED IT OUT A LITTLE EARLIER.
[ct=6582.220] THIS IS WHAT THE COACHES LIKE SO
[ct=6584.623] MUCH ABOUT HIM COMING OFFER THE
[ct=6586.290] BALL AS HE COMES UP THE FIELD
[ct=6588.723] HERE AND THEN HE JUST CONTINUES
[ct=6590.030] TO PLAY, ANZALONE MISSES HIM BUT
[ct=6592.953] YET HE’S THERE TO CLEAN IT UP.
[ct=6596.990] >> Joe: STOUT HITS IT.
[ct=6598.451] RAYMOND WAITING FOR IT AS IT
[ct=6598.875] HEADS OUT OF BOUNDS.
[ct=6607.797] KELVIN SHEPPARD HAS DONE SOME
[ct=6612.230] LOOK HOW FAR THIS BALL WENT OUT
[ct=6614.564] OF BOUNDS UP AT THE 30.
[ct=6615.534] THAT’S WHERE THEY’LL MARK IT.
[ct=6620.030] JUST A 38-YARD PUNT AND HERE IS
[ct=6621.488] AL-QUADIN MUHAMMAD NOT QUITTING
[ct=6626.009] ON THE PLAY AND KELVIN SHEPPARD
[ct=6626.994] TOLD US, AL-QUADIN MUHAMMAD IS
[ct=6628.870] GOING TO BE OKAY IS KIND OF THE
[ct=6632.458] LAST MAN STANDING ACROSS FROM
[ct=6632.751] AIDAN HUTCHINSON TO RUSH IN.
[ct=6634.546] >> Troy: YEAH, THEY LIKE HIM AND
[ct=6636.493] I LIKE KELVIN SHEPPARD AND WHAT
[ct=6639.479] HE HAS BROUGHT, YOU KNOW, HE’S
[ct=6641.181] CONTINUED TO PLAY THE STYLE AND
[ct=6642.305] I’M NOT SURPRISED.
[ct=6644.004] DAN CAMPBELL KNOWS WHAT HE WANTS
[ct=6644.641] THIS TEAM TO BE.
[ct=6648.519] HE FELT KELVIN SHEPPARD WAS THE
[ct=6650.973] GUY TO NAME HIM AS DEFENSIVE
[ct=6651.728] COORDINATOR AND THEY CONTINUE TO
[ct=6654.873] TAKE IT TO THESE OFFENSES AND
[ct=6655.503] THE DEFENSES RESPONDED TO HIM.
[ct=6658.716] >> Joe: HERE’S GREEN CRASHING
[ct=6659.614] DOWN ON IT, GIBBS RUNS AWAY FROM
[ct=6663.852] AND HE IS OUT OF BOUNDS BUT A
[ct=6664.899] NICE GAIN ON FIRST DOWN.
[ct=6672.111] MAYBE JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE ON
[ct=6672.111] KELVIN SHEPPARD WHO AS I
[ct=6674.258] MENTIONED EARLIER HAD AN
[ct=6675.568] EIGHT-YEAR PLAYING CAREER AS A
[ct=6677.236] LINEBACKER.
[ct=6685.610] HE’S BEEN THE LINEBACKERS COACH
[ct=6689.611] WITH THIS TEAM SINCE 2022,
[ct=6689.891] PLAYED FOR BUFFALO,
[ct=6691.613] INDIANAPOLIS, DETROIT, NEVER
[ct=6691.966] THOUGHT HE WOULD BE A COACH.
[ct=6694.428] BUT NOW THAT HE’S IN IT, HE
[ct=6694.686] LOVES IT.
[ct=6696.773] >> Troy: YEAH, DAN CAMPBELL SAID
[ct=6698.691] WHEN HE WAS WITH HIM IN MIAMI HE
[ct=6700.314] ALWAYS KNEW HE’D MAKE A GREAT
[ct=6701.450] COACH WHEN HE WAS STILL A
[ct=6702.859] >> Joe: HERE’S A STRONG RUN FOR
[ct=6703.502] A FIRST DOWN BY GIBBS.
[ct=6706.846] AND THE GOOD TEAMS AND YOU
[ct=6708.073] CERTAINLY WERE ON ONE OF THEM
[ct=6709.634] THAT COULD DO WHAT THE LIONS ARE
[ct=6714.630] TRYING TO DO, SALT AWAY A LEAD,
[ct=6716.668] RUN THE BALL, RUN THE CLOCK DOWN
[ct=6717.893] AND WHEN YOU KNOW THE RUNS ARE
[ct=6719.684] COMING AND CAN’T STOP IT, THAT
[ct=6720.586] MEANS THAT THIS YOUNG OFFENSIVE
[ct=6722.816] LINE IS DOING A GOOD JOB FOR THE
[ct=6724.719] >> Troy: YES, THAT’S TRUE, AND I
[ct=6725.703] WAS GOING TO SAY, JOE, IT’S
[ct=6727.061] HARDER AND HARDER FOR TEAMS TO
[ct=6727.492] DO THAT.
[ct=6729.567] IT’S NEVER BEEN EASY, BUT IT’S
[ct=6731.980] BECOME INCREASINGLY HARDER AS
[ct=6733.148] WE’VE GONE MORE TO THESE SPREAD
[ct=6733.745] OFFENSE, TEAMS HAVE RELIED MORE
[ct=6735.099] ON THE PASS.
[ct=6736.682] THAT IT’S HARD TO RUN THE
[ct=6738.277] FOOTBALL WHEN THE DEFENSE KNOWS
[ct=6739.788] YOU’RE GOING TO, BUT THE LIONS,
[ct=6740.814] AS DAN CAMPBELL OFTEN SAYS,
[ct=6741.768] THEY’RE BUILT FOR THIS.
[ct=6747.865] >> Joe: GIBBS, WELL PLAYED BY
[ct=6748.377] THE RAVENS’ DEFENSE, A GAIN OF
[ct=6748.377] TWO.
[ct=6752.496] YOU KNOW, WE TALKED ABOUT THE
[ct=6754.706] YOUNG GUARDS THAT THE LIONS
[ct=6755.993] HAVE, THEY HAVE THE TEN-YEAR VET
[ct=6758.680] GLASGOW AT CENTER AND THEN TWO
[ct=6760.223] OUTSTANDING TACKLES, PENEI
[ct=6762.454] SEWELL WHO IS ONE OF THE BEST
[ct=6763.702] PLAYERS IN THE LEAGUE, THAT’S
[ct=6765.830] HIM IN THE MIDDLE, 58 AND TAYLOR
[ct=6766.674] DECKER WHO IS PLAYING THROUGH A
[ct=6767.969] BAD SHOULDER, 68 OUT AT LEFT
[ct=6772.634] >> Troy: AND LAST YEAR AND
[ct=6774.186] REALLY FOR THE LAST SEVERAL
[ct=6776.432] YEARS THEY’VE BEEN SO STRONG AND
[ct=6778.279] THIS TEAM, I DON’T THINK IT’S A
[ct=6779.760] STRETCH TO SAY THEY’RE GOING TO
[ct=6782.052] GO AS FAR AS THOSE YOUNG GUARDS
[ct=6783.683] ALLOW THEM TO GO BECAUSE THEY’RE
[ct=6785.175] PRETTY SOLID EVERYWHERE ELSE.
[ct=6786.204] BUT THEY’VE HAD A GOOD SHOWING
[ct=6791.133] >> Joe: SECOND AND 8 AND HAND TO
[ct=6797.556] THE LIONS HAVE A DATE WITH THE
[ct=6799.219] BROWNS NEXT.
[ct=6801.573] I MENTIONED BROWNS JUST BEAT
[ct=6802.701] GREEN BAY THEN THEY’RE AT
[ct=6805.886] CINCINNATI, THE JOE BURROWLESS
[ct=6810.334] BENGALS AT KANSAS CITY AND THEN
[ct=6811.452] BACK ON MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL
[ct=6814.005] BEFORE THEIR BYE WEEK AGAINST
[ct=6814.978] THE TAMPA BAY BUCS.
[ct=6818.995] >> Troy: DAN CAMPBELL IS LOOKING
[ct=6819.550] AT THIS.
[ct=6820.378] THEY WON’T BE ABLE TO TAKE IT TO
[ct=6822.012] THE TWO-MINUTE WARNING.
[ct=6822.989] IT’S JUST A SPLIT SECOND OFF.
[ct=6828.991] >> Joe: THIRD DOWN AND FIVE AND
[ct=6831.391] BECAUSE OF THAT, THEY CAN THROW
[ct=6834.136] A PASS.
[ct=6837.160] SAFE. THE
[ct=6838.348] NATIONWIDE POSTGAME, WE WILL
[ct=6839.908] VISIT WITH ONE OF THE STARS OF
[ct=6841.405] THE GAME HERE FROM BOTH
[ct=6841.405] QUARTERBACKS.
[ct=6843.656] COACHES GO INSIDE THE WINNING
[ct=6844.652] LOCKER ROOM AS WELL AND LOOK
[ct=6846.226] FORWARD TO TALKING ABOUT THIS
[ct=6847.512] FANTASTIC GAME WITH YOU AND
[ct=6847.838] TROY.
[ct=6848.174] JOE, BACK
[ct=6849.928] FOURTH AND TWO.
[ct=6849.928] >> YEP.
[ct=6851.627] AND FOURTH AND TWO.
[ct=6854.740] AND THE LIONS TROY LOOK LIKE
[ct=6855.026] THEY'RE GOING TO GO FOR IT.
[ct=6856.405] THEY'RE TWO FOR TWO ON FOURTH
[ct=6857.481] DOWN TRIES IN THIS GAME.
[ct=6859.670] MAYBE THEY TRY TO HARD COUNT
[ct=6861.567] DRAW THEM OFFSIDES BUT DIDN'T
[ct=6863.194] APPEAR TO BE ANY HESITATION FROM
[ct=6863.672] DAN CAMPBELL.
[ct=6864.593] NOT SURPRISED.
[ct=6867.500] HE'S GOT BIG ONIONS I MEAN THIS
[ct=6868.596] IS THIS IS A BOLD MOVE.
[ct=6870.668] EVEN WITH A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=6872.394] THEY CANNOT RUN OUT THE CLOCK
[ct=6873.913] BECAUSE THE RAVENS STILL HAVE
[ct=6876.931] ALL THREE TIME OUTS.
[ct=6882.354] >> Joe: MONTGOMERY IN THE
[ct=6882.354] BACKFIELD ON FOURTH AND TWO.
[ct=6889.425] GOFF KEEPS, FLOATS, AMON-RA ST.
[ct=6889.869] BROWN, THROW AND CATCH.
[ct=6891.190] UNREAL.
[ct=6894.416] BUT A FLAG IS DOWN BACK AT THE
[ct=6895.430] 50.
[ct=6899.628] HERE’S THE CALL.
[ct=6902.391] >> Referee: HOLDING, DEFENSE,
[ct=6902.862] NUMBER 44.
[ct=6905.588] PENALTY IS DECLINED.
[ct=6907.483] THE RESULT OF THE PLAY IS FIRST
[ct=6910.764] >> Joe: TROY, HOW GOOD WAS THAT
[ct=6911.090] THROW?
[ct=6912.744] >> Troy: IT WAS THE BEST THROW
[ct=6913.025] OF THE NIGHT.
[ct=6914.966] THIS BALL HAD TO BE PERFECT.
[ct=6916.777] MARLON HUMPHREY, NUMBER 44, IS
[ct=6917.919] GOING TO BE THE ONE WHO GRABS
[ct=6919.753] AND HE’S GOT HIS EYES IN THE
[ct=6921.824] HE’S JUST NOT ANTICIPATING THAT
[ct=6923.243] ST. BROWN IS GOING TO GO OUT ON
[ct=6924.565] THE ROUTE BUT THIS BALL,
[ct=6927.144] A STEP.
[ct=6927.477] I’M WATCHING IT THE WHOLE WAY
[ct=6928.998] BUT YOU GOT TO MAKE THIS THROW
[ct=6930.698] AND THE GREAT ONES MAKE IT AND
[ct=6934.234] JARED GOFF LAYS IT OUT THERE
[ct=6936.584] PERFECTLY ON FOURTH DOWN.
[ct=6936.864] THAT’S AS GOOD AS IT GETS.
[ct=6940.173] >> Joe: 20 YARDS ON FOURTH DOWN
[ct=6940.625] AND TWO.
[ct=6942.732] 3 FOR 3 GOING FOR IT ON FOURTH
[ct=6945.376] THINK THESE GUYS HAVE ANY FUN
[ct=6947.133] PLAYING FOR DAN CAMPBELL.
[ct=6949.173] >> Troy: MY GOSH, YEAH.
[ct=6950.539] THEY KNOW WHAT THEY’RE GOING TO
[ct=6952.583] I MEAN, IT’S NO SURPRISE.
[ct=6956.863] JARED WILL BE ASKED ABOUT IT
[ct=6957.150] AFTER THIS GAME.
[ct=6958.604] HE’LL ANSWER IT.
[ct=6959.392] THERE WAS NEVER A DOUBT THAT
[ct=6961.860] THEY WERE GOING TO GO FOR IT ON
[ct=6962.779] FOURTH -- IT’S WHAT THEY’RE USED
[ct=6963.774] THE WAY THEY’RE BUILT.
[ct=6966.495] >> Joe: NOW MONTGOMERY, HE IS
[ct=6966.800] GOING TO BREAK.
[ct=6972.893] DAVID MONTGOMERY IS IN FOR THE
[ct=6972.893] TOUCHDOWN!
[ct=6984.023] JUST A STUNNING, STUNNING COUPLE
[ct=6990.137] OF PLAYS BACK-TO-BACK AND THE
[ct=6991.701] DETROIT LIONS, IT APPEARS, ARE
[ct=6992.693] GOING TO WALK OUT OF HERE WITH
[ct=6995.255] THEIR SECOND WIN OF THE YEAR.
[ct=6998.029] >> Troy: WE COME IN TALKING
[ct=6999.046] ABOUT THESE YOUNG GUARDS.
[ct=7001.607] MAHOGANY AND TATE RATLEDGE AND
[ct=7003.504] THE JOB THAT THEY HAVE DONE
[ct=7004.744] TONIGHT AND REALLY ALL FIVE OF
[ct=7007.371] THOSE GUYS ALONG WITH THE
[ct=7008.721] RECEIVERS, JAMESON WILLIAMS,
[ct=7013.023] HE’S DOWN THE FIELD BLOCKING,
[ct=7015.136] 225 YARDS RUSHING TONIGHT FOR
[ct=7015.136] THE DETROIT LIONS.
[ct=7017.762] >> Joe: GOFF IS TELLING HIM TO
[ct=7018.625] GO DOWN.
[ct=7019.553] >> Troy: UNLESS HE CAN SCORE AND
[ct=7022.285] THEN IT’S OKAY.
[ct=7024.667] >> Joe: 31 YARDS AND THE LIONS’
[ct=7026.236] RUSHING ATTACK IN THIS GAME,
[ct=7029.913] FOUR RUSHING TOUCHDOWNS, 225
[ct=7030.557] RUSH YARDS.
[ct=7035.623] AND THIS IS A 14-POINT GAME.
[ct=7040.259] AND THERE’S TAYLOR DECKER WITH A
[ct=7042.201] HUG FOR DAVID MONTGOMERY.
[ct=7044.462] GRAHAM GLASGOW, THE TEN-YEAR
[ct=7046.542] AT CENTER.
[ct=7048.381] BOY, THIS IS SOME IMPRESSIVE
[ct=7053.004] NIGHT, HANK FRALEY, HIS NICKNAME
[ct=7055.040] WAS HONEY BUNS WHEN HE PLAYED
[ct=7056.651] FOR THE PHILADELPHIA EAGLES.
[ct=7058.242] WHAT A JOB HE HAS DONE WITH THIS
[ct=7060.468] GROUP AND THE RUSH YARDS AND
[ct=7062.851] WHEN THE LIONS NEEDED A PERFECT
[ct=7064.624] THROW FROM OFFSIDES THEY GOT IT.
[ct=7065.587] >> Troy: AS SOMEONE WHO WAS A
[ct=7066.750] PART OF A GREAT OFFENSIVE LINE
[ct=7068.219] AND GREAT RUNNING BACK AND BEING
[ct=7070.929] ABLE TO DO WHAT THE LIONS HAVE
[ct=7071.826] DONE TONIGHT AND ICE A GAME
[ct=7073.021] THAT -- I KNOW HOW GOOD THAT
[ct=7073.363] FEELS.
[ct=7079.155] JAYDEN DANIELS DELIVERED
[ct=7081.121] JARED GOFF DELIVERED THE PERFECT
[ct=7083.642] THROW AND HANK FRALEY AND WHAT
[ct=7084.261] HE’S DONE SINCE HE CAME TO
[ct=7085.789] DETROIT AND THESE YOUNG GUYS AND
[ct=7087.573] THEY’VE BEEN QUESTIONED ALL WEEK
[ct=7089.097] LONG, EVEN AFTER THEIR
[ct=7090.045] PERFORMANCE LAST WEEK AND TO
[ct=7091.736] HAVE THE NIGHT THEY’VE HAD ON
[ct=7093.115] THE ROAD IN A BIG GAME.
[ct=7096.803] MEASURING STICK TONIGHT, I MEAN,
[ct=7097.287] THAT’S GOING TO BE ONE HECK OF A
[ct=7098.132] PLANE RIDE BACK TO DETROIT.
[ct=7103.521] >> Joe: NO HEAD COACH GOES FOR
[ct=7104.741] IT MORE ON FOURTH DOWN.
[ct=7107.437] HE’S DONE IT THREE MORE TIMES
[ct=7108.907] TONIGHT SINCE HE’S BEEN HEAD
[ct=7111.464] COACH SINCE 2021.
[ct=7111.464] ALI WILL TAKE A KNEE.
[ct=7114.350] IT’LL COME OUT TO THE 35.
[ct=7117.175] THINK ABOUT DAN CAMPBELL TAKING
[ct=7117.175] OVER IN 2021.
[ct=7123.365] THREE WINS HIS FIRST YEAR, NINE
[ct=7126.194] HIS SECOND, 12 WINS, FRANCHISE
[ct=7126.632] RECORD 15 LAST YEAR.
[ct=7130.208] HE’S GOT THIS TEAM HUMMING AGAIN
[ct=7131.415] HERE IN 2025.
[ct=7133.779] THIS IS A BIG WIN HERE TONIGHT
[ct=7136.356] IN BALTIMORE AFTER THAT LOSS AT
[ct=7137.701] GREEN BAY, YES, THEY BEAT THE
[ct=7139.830] BEARS, BUT THIS LAST A DIFFERENT
[ct=7139.830] FEEL.
[ct=7140.701] >> Troy: I AGREE AND THEY ALL
[ct=7141.066] COUNT THE SAME.
[ct=7145.383] YOU KNOW, THERE’S 17 OF THEM,
[ct=7146.268] BUT THERE ARE SOME THAT FEEL A
[ct=7147.128] LITTLE DIFFERENT.
[ct=7147.926] AND THIS IS ONE OF THOSE.
[ct=7152.800] STILL 1:40.
[ct=7155.814] THREE TIME-OUTS BUT A 14-POINT
[ct=7156.842] GAME AS BATEMAN DOWNFIELD.
[ct=7159.569] IT’S OUT OF HIS REACH.
[ct=7162.124] TERRION ARNOLD WITH GOOD
[ct=7162.421] COVERAGE THAT TIME FOR THE
[ct=7168.958] LAMAR JACKSON’S NUMBERS, 18 OF
[ct=7170.811] 24.
[ct=7170.811] 210.
[ct=7172.253] THOSE LONG DRIVES JUST KEPT HIM
[ct=7175.008] OFF THE FIELD.
[ct=7177.555] THEY HAD TWO DRIVES OF OVER 95
[ct=7178.750] YARDS FOR TOUCHDOWNS TONIGHT.
[ct=7179.206] THE LIONS DID.
[ct=7182.252] >> Troy: YEAH, JUST 49 PLAYS
[ct=7184.566] RIGHT NOW OFFENSIVELY FOR
[ct=7188.475] BALTIMORE AND THEY HAD THEIR
[ct=7188.771] OPPORTUNITIES, AND OFFENSIVELY
[ct=7189.897] THEY’RE NOT GOING TO FEEL GOOD
[ct=7191.319] ABOUT WHAT THEY DID.
[ct=7192.464] >> Joe: SECOND DOWN AND TEN.
[ct=7197.226] JACKSON IN TROUBLE AGAIN AND
[ct=7197.559] ANOTHER SACK.
[ct=7210.558] IT’S ANZALONE AND AL-QUADIN
[ct=7210.558] MUHAMMAD WHO’S BEEN EVERYWHERE
[ct=7212.881] TONIGHT AND THAT’S A SEVEN-SACK
[ct=7213.643] NIGHT FOR THE LIONS.
[ct=7214.299] ON LAMAR JACKSON.
[ct=7221.507] KELVIN SHEPPARD BETTER GET A
[ct=7221.875] GAME -- BETTER GET A GAME BALL
[ct=7223.545] IN THIS ONE TONIGHT TOO.
[ct=7224.851] >> Troy: YEAH, I MENTIONED IT.
[ct=7227.300] I WAS AS ANXIOUS RAS ANYONE TO
[ct=7228.447] SEE HOW THE LIONS WOULD DO WITH
[ct=7229.966] NEW COORDINATORS AND JOHN
[ct=7231.138] MORTON, KELVIN SHEPPARD.
[ct=7236.483] >> Joe: BIG HIT BY BRANCH AND
[ct=7236.794] NICE JOB BY HILL.
[ct=7238.849] SURVIVES THAT HILL.
[ct=7243.134] OUT OF BOUNDS HE GOES.
[ct=7244.384] >> T ALL THE CREDIT.
[ct=7246.500] YOU KNOW WE SHOW THE POINT OR
[ct=7248.148] EXCUSE ME THE WIN TOTALS AND HOW
[ct=7249.010] HE'S INCREASED THEM.
[ct=7250.349] HE'LL HAVE A HARD TIME
[ct=7251.481] INCREASING FROM LAST YEAR.
[ct=7252.739] YEAH 15 AND TWO.
[ct=7255.053] BUT YOU KNOW IT'S HARD WHEN YOU
[ct=7256.590] LOSE YOUR COORDINATORS.
[ct=7259.335] IT'S HARD WHEN YOU LOSE AS MANY
[ct=7260.470] COACHES OFF THE STAFF AS HE DID
[ct=7261.704] THIS PAST YEAR.
[ct=7264.266] AND THEN YOU'RE REPLACING THEM
[ct=7264.560] AND THEN STARTING OVER.
[ct=7267.125] AND I MEAN, IT IS REALLY HARD ON
[ct=7269.421] A LOT OF LEVELS FOOTBALL WISE,
[ct=7271.635] BUT ALSO TO TO HIM PERSONALLY.
[ct=7273.722] AND YET HE FILLED THOSE
[ct=7275.065] VACANCIES AND BY ALL ACCOUNTS,
[ct=7276.760] IT LOOKS LIKE HE DID A GREAT JOB
[ct=7276.760] WITH IT.
[ct=7279.777] NICE THROW AND CATCH.
[ct=7280.931] BATEMAN MADE THE GRAB.
[ct=7282.516] IT'S A TOTAL OF EIGHT.
[ct=7283.637] IF YOU WANT TO PUT A NUMBER
[ct=7286.228] YEAH, THE TWO COORDINATORS AND
[ct=7287.870] SIX ASSISTANT COACHES.
[ct=7289.546] AND YET THEY'VE FILLED IN.
[ct=7291.788] THESE TEAMS KIND OF MIRROR EACH
[ct=7291.788] OTHER.
[ct=7293.707] THEY'VE GOT GREAT COORDINATORS.
[ct=7295.324] THEY'VE GOT GMS THAT FIND
[ct=7296.489] EVERYWHERE.
[ct=7298.994] THEY'VE GOT GOOD OWNERSHIP, GOT
[ct=7300.964] A HEAD COACH THAT IS IN CON
[ct=7301.458] IN CHARGE.
[ct=7302.768] THEY'VE GOT GREAT ROSTERS.
[ct=7307.348] AND FOR DAN CAMPBELL TO FILL IN
[ct=7309.713] WITH EIGHT NEW COACHES.
[ct=7311.689] UNDER HIM FOR THE LIONS IT'S
[ct=7318.417] JACKSON STEPS THROUGH.
[ct=7320.751] CHASED DOWN FROM BEHIND AND NOW
[ct=7323.224] OUT OF BOUNDS AS BRANCH GETS
[ct=7324.422] THERE FOR DETROIT.
[ct=7325.986] KNOW WHEN WE TALKED TO DAN
[ct=7327.383] CAMPBELL ABOUT THE RESPECT THAT
[ct=7328.645] HE HAS FOR THE BALTIMORE RAVENS.
[ct=7330.785] AND HE SAID AS A FIRST TIME HEAD
[ct=7331.737] COACH, YOU ASK YOURSELF WHAT YOU
[ct=7334.511] WANT YOUR PROGRAM TO LOOK LIKE.
[ct=7336.471] AND BALTIMORE IS THAT TEAM.
[ct=7338.275] AND THEY'VE BEEN DOING IT AT A
[ct=7339.528] HIGH LEVEL FOR 30 YEARS.
[ct=7341.849] AND DAN CAMPBELL SAID, YOU KNOW,
[ct=7343.377] THAT'S WHAT I WANTED MY PROGRAM
[ct=7344.642] TO LOOK LIKE, THE WAY IN WHICH
[ct=7346.991] THEY COMPETE, THEIR PHYSICAL
[ct=7349.384] STYLE, THEIR AGGRESSIVE AND
[ct=7351.222] EVERYTHING IS KIND OF IN UNISON
[ct=7352.690] THROUGHOUT THE ORGANIZATION.
[ct=7353.808] THE PEOPLE THEY BRING IN.
[ct=7356.040] ERIC DECOSTA, OF COURSE, WHO
[ct=7357.443] REPLACED OZZIE NEWSOME AS THE
[ct=7358.498] GENERAL MANAGER.
[ct=7360.634] AND THEY'VE JUST THERE’S SO MUCH
[ct=7364.606] CONTINUITY IN HOW THEY RUN THE
[ct=7367.112] ORGANIZATION IN BALTIMORE AND IN
[ct=7367.858] DETROIT HAS BEEN THE SAME WAY.
[ct=7370.045] AND AND THE PROOF IS IN THE
[ct=7370.740] RESULTS.
[ct=7374.164] THERE'S OZZIE HALL OF FAMER TWO
[ct=7377.509] TIMES OVER SECOND DOWN AND
[ct=7378.228] SEVEN.
[ct=7382.546] JACKSON BACKPEDALING.
[ct=7384.975] ANDREWS WIDE OPEN ONE ON ONE.
[ct=7387.174] AND HE'LL TAKE IT IN HIS SECOND
[ct=7389.376] OF THE NIGHT WITH 29 SECONDS TO
[ct=7389.376] GO.
[ct=7395.411] THEY'LL GO FOR TWO.
[ct=7395.696] AND THEN.
[ct=7400.284] WE'LL HAVE AN ONSIDE KICK.
[ct=7401.716] SO NOTHING HAPPENS.
[ct=7403.713] EASY IN THIS LEAGUE.
[ct=7405.261] YESTERDAY WAS A CRAZY DAY AROUND
[ct=7407.126] THE NFL.
[ct=7409.460] THIS WOULD EASILY GO DOWN AS THE
[ct=7411.281] CRAZIEST IF THE RAVENS WERE TO
[ct=7411.782] GET UP OFF THE DECK.
[ct=7414.460] 14 POINTS DOWN WITH UNDER TWO
[ct=7415.951] MINUTES TO GO.
[ct=7418.051] YOU KNOW WE WE'VE WE’VE BEEN
[ct=7420.178] AROUND THIS GAME A LITTLE TOO
[ct=7420.178] LONG AS HAS
[ct=7422.606] WHEN WE SHOWED HIM YOU SAW THE
[ct=7425.052] LOOK ON HIS FACE AFTER THAT
[ct=7429.262] TOUCHDOWN MONDAY.
[ct=7434.583] RONNIE PITCH TWO POINT TRY WILL
[ct=7436.026] BE THEIR FIRST OF THE YEAR.
[ct=7442.645] HEY IT'S HOT.
[ct=7445.048] JACKSON FLIPS IT.
[ct=7447.205] FLAG IS DOWN IN THE END ZONE.
[ct=7453.359] IT'S A HOLD AGAINST THE LIONS.
[ct=7457.575] WE'VE REFERENCED THE CRAZY DAY
[ct=7459.932] THAT YESTERDAY WAS AROUND THE
[ct=7460.303] NFL.
[ct=7461.140] YESTERDAY.
[ct=7462.908] >> HOLDING DEFENSE NUMBER 32.
[ct=7465.617] INELIGIBLE RECEIVER DOWNFIELD
[ct=7467.019] OFFENSE NUMBER 77.
[ct=7468.398] PENALTIES.
[ct=7468.398] OFFSET.
[ct=7468.737] RETRY.
[ct=7470.567] >> SO WE'LL RETRY THE TWO
[ct=7472.431] CONVERSION.
[ct=7474.835] TWO POINT CONVERSION ON MIKE
[ct=7474.835] CLAY.
[ct=7477.082] THEY WERE NINE DEFENSIVE AND
[ct=7479.249] SPECIAL TEAMS TOUCHDOWNS THIS
[ct=7480.117] WEEK, MOST IN FIVE YEARS.
[ct=7483.774] AND THE FIRST DAY IN NFL HISTORY
[ct=7484.129] WITH MULTIPLE BLOCKED FIELD
[ct=7486.500] GOALS RETURNED FOR TOUCHDOWNS IN
[ct=7488.962] THE FOURTH QUARTER, BOTH WITH
[ct=7490.869] UNDER TWO MINUTES TO PLAY.
[ct=7495.341] BACKPEDALING AND INCOMPLETE FOR
[ct=7495.341] ZAY,
[ct=7498.367] ADD TO THAT WOULD BE IF THE
[ct=7502.617] RAVENS COME UP WITH THE SECOND
[ct=7504.762] SUCCESSFUL ONSIDE KICK OF THE
[ct=7506.563] TEAMS ARE ONE FOR 11.
[ct=7509.196] THE ONLY TEAM TO GET ONE WAS
[ct=7513.375] CAROLINA IN WEEK TWO AT ARIZONA.
[ct=7518.259] ONE OTHER LITTLE NOTE BEFORE WE
[ct=7518.970] RUN OUT OF TIME AT THE END.
[ct=7520.550] THIS IS ONLY THE SECOND TIME THE
[ct=7522.382] RAVENS DEFENSE HAS ALLOWED FOUR
[ct=7526.842] RUSHING TOUCHDOWNS AT HOME IN
[ct=7527.641] THEIR 30 YEAR.
[ct=7531.355] HISTORY SINCE 96.
[ct=7535.707] THAT'S WHAT THE LIONS HAVE DONE
[ct=7542.358] LUKE, THE ROOKIE WILL TRY AND
[ct=7544.723] COME UP WITH A PERFECT KICK.
[ct=7547.150] UP IT GOES.
[ct=7549.554] LAPORTA HAS HAD A NICE NIGHT AND
[ct=7553.281] THE LIONS WILL TAKE OVER WITH 27
[ct=7553.281] SECONDS TO GO.
[ct=7555.003] AND THAT'LL DO IT.
[ct=7555.458] THAT'LL DO IT.
[ct=7557.240] THIS IS AS YOU MENTIONED JOE.
[ct=7558.682] THIS IS GOING TO BE A GOOD WIN
[ct=7559.529] FOR WHOEVER WON IT.
[ct=7562.785] BUT FOR DETROIT TO BE ABLE TO
[ct=7565.126] WIN ON THE ROAD, YOU CAN SEE
[ct=7567.207] WHAT IT MEANS TO DAN CAMPBELL.
[ct=7570.237] AND THAT SIDELINES AND EVERYBODY
[ct=7571.330] IN A LIONS UNIFORM.
[ct=7573.882] BUT.
[ct=7575.024] THIS IS A RAVENS TEAM THAT I
[ct=7577.939] STILL THINK IS ONE OF THE BEST.
[ct=7579.806] AND YOU KNOW YOU DIG YOURSELF A
[ct=7580.718] LITTLE BIT OF A HOLE.
[ct=7581.716] THE GOOD NEWS IS THERE'S STILL A
[ct=7583.391] LOT OF FOOTBALL LEFT TO BE
[ct=7585.513] PLAYED.
[ct=7585.768] BUT THEY'VE GOT A LOT TO CLEAN
[ct=7587.156] THERE IS SOME BAD NEWS, THOUGH.
[ct=7589.519] THEY DO HAVE THREE UPCOMING
[ct=7590.870] OPPONENTS THE NEXT THREE WEEKS.
[ct=7592.319] IT ALL PLAYED IN THE DIVISIONAL
[ct=7593.297] ROUND OF THE PLAYOFFS, AND THEY
[ct=7595.515] WILL HEAD INTO KANSAS CITY NEXT
[ct=7599.131] WEEK WITH A RECORD OF ONE AND
[ct=7603.371] THAT GAME ON SUNDAY.
[ct=7605.512] THIS IS AN EIGHT POINT WIN FOR
[ct=7608.656] THE LIONS TO GET TO TWO AND ONE,
[ct=7610.293] AND THIS WAS AN IMPRESSIVE NIGHT
[ct=7611.485] ALL THE WAY AROUND FOR DETROIT.
[ct=7616.731] 38 CARRIES ON THE NIGHT FOR THE
[ct=7619.568] LIONS 224 YARDS FOUR TOUCHDOWNS.
[ct=7623.322] GOFF 20 OF 28 2021 TOUCHDO
[ct=7623.839] PICKS.
[ct=7626.025] AND HE MADE SOME BIG THROWS WHEN
[ct=7626.943] THEY MATTERED MOST.
[ct=7627.484] WELL, HE SURE DID.
[ct=7630.160] AND WHAT THEY WERE ABLE TO DO ON
[ct=7631.373] ON THIRD DOWN TONIGHT.
[ct=7632.695] YOU KNOW, IT
[ct=7634.602] WAYS A DIFFERENCE.
[ct=7635.791] BUT WHEN THEY NEEDED HIM TO MAKE
[ct=7639.382] THE THROW AND DELIVER, HE HE DID
[ct=7639.853] IT DOWN TO
