destination coming up it s the longestrunning rivalry in the south it s the meeting between 16th ranked auburn and the seventh ranked georgia bulldogs let s go at national car rental we believe that

bulldogs let s go back one fold year 365 days ago it took four overtime periods to decide this one cranky stop to the fourth down play and the georgia bulldogs have won it by a final score of 56 to 49 sending off a gigantic celebration and would you talk to the seniors particularly here at georgia they say that is the football game that vaulted them into what they have done this season with an 8 in one record hi everybody ron franklin welcome once again to espn saturday night primetime college football for the first time in a very long time the meeting between our byrne and georgia has got a lot on the line first of all for georgia they want to win out they want to have 10 and 1 as the record at a shot as an alliance team and as far as our bird is concerned while they control their own destiny they want to continue to win wound up in atlanta and face off against the eastern division champion at a shot at the sec championship mike godfrey joins me on the telecast as usual and mike highstakes is what you would have to say about this year s meeting between auburn and georgia ron <person player="chris terry" race="UNK" position="OL">terry</person> bob has gambled this year on his passing game feeling it then it would carry his offense he football team lap two weeks ago they lost to mississippi state gets shutout theyve had two weeks to prepare for this ballgame and i really look forward to get the ball to<person player="fred beasley" race="UNK" position="RB">fred beasley</person>tonight the former tailback fullback in a one back set and try to run the football with<person player="fred beasley" race="UNK" position="RB">fred beasley</person>mike what i look at the university of georgia the greatest difference that i can see this year is quarterback<person player="mike bobo" race="UNK" position="QB">mike bobo</person>last year he and his coach did not seem to be on the same page that s not the case this season no im talking to<person player="mike bobo" race="UNK" position="QB">mike bobo</person>the other day of practice he said you know i just didnt understand the offense last year and he said this year i understand it it s it s coming more easily to me and he s playing within the system and his numbers reflect that he s got five interceptions this year as opposed to 16 last year throwing for about 64% completions and he s used his other weapons<person player="hines ward" race="UNK" position="RB">hines ward</person>robin <person player="robert edwards" race="UNK" position="RB">edwards</person> go down to the sidelines to check for the third member of our telecast team here s adrian <person player="karsten bailey" race="UNK" position="WR">karsten</person> run thanks very much you know it really is jim donnan offensive creativity that has<person player="hines ward" race="UNK" position="RB">hines ward</person>lining up tonight is perhaps the most versatile player in college football ward the quarterback slash running back slash wide receiver slash kickoff returner she s gonna be slashing all over this field tonight and the ironic thing is ron that he may be most dangerous when he doesnt have the ball in his hands when he s used as a decoy because it s then when the offensive eyes of auburn are on him that the thrower passed off to someone else he s a lot of fun to watch night on ok well i can see his breath tonight it is very cool but give me those weather conditions in just a moment supposed to be down into the 20s by the time this ballgame is over tonight and extremely windy conditions as jared holmes has the ball teed up and here is the opening kickoff and this is going to be about nine yards deep in fact out of the back of the end zone and georgia will scrimmage at the 20 yard line so let s take a look at the starters<person player="mike bobo" race="UNK" position="QB">mike bobo</person>of course will go at quarterback but he will have behind him<person player="robert edwards" race="UNK" position="RB">robert edwards</person>the rocket man a<person player="patrick pass" race="nonwhite" position="RB">patrick pass</person>also number six the receivers<person player="hines ward" race="UNK" position="RB">hines ward</person>he does everything as adrian said cory <person player="corey allen" race="UNK" position="WR">allen</person> an outstanding senior<person player="larry brown" race="UNK" position="TE">larry brown</person>the tide in and up front on the offensive line well the bell cow here <person player="matt stinchcomb" race="UNK" position="OL">matt</person> stench coma he was on the right side they moved him to the left side and <person player="chris terry" race="UNK" position="OL">chris</person> terrio a great job and right tackle georgia at the line and theyre going to snap the football in auburn headed to get set quickly as the pitch goes to <person player="robert edwards" race="UNK" position="RB">edwards</person> gets a block <person player="takeo spikes" race="nonwhite" position="LB">spikes</person> is there the type cale <person player="takeo spikes" race="nonwhite" position="LB">spikes</person> will take him down for the very first play and georgia with a player down at the 24 yard line and at<person player="hines ward" race="UNK" position="RB">hines ward</person>who was injured on the very first play of this football game ron georgia came out they ran out to the field tried to snap the ball quick to try to catch albarn who s a very complex defensive doesnt a lot of things on defense trying to catch him sleeping a little bit on the first play jim donnan looks on very concerned obviously because of the multipurpose guy high board going down on the very first play and mike theyre helping him off the field and then just looking at him he just had his bell rung i think he got a knee in the helmet youre gonna see him crack back right here this is him right here and it looks like his knee the knee of the defensive player hit him in the helmet it s exactly right and you can see he goes down at the 24 yard line now the question is for the trainer s and also with the doctor to look him over and make sure that he is okay to come back into this football game and meanwhile auburn with an injured player as well just over on the sideline and it looks like<person player="jimmy brumbaugh" race="UNK" position="DL">jimmy brumbaugh</person>so two key players for both football teams injured on the opening play from scrimmage it s interesting because <person player="jimmy brumbaugh" race="UNK" position="DL">jimmy</person> brim from ball talking the other day said that<person player="hines ward" race="UNK" position="RB">hines ward</person>was the best player in the sec both of them go out with an injury on the first play boy this is indeed tough sledding for both football teams particularly if boasts cannot come back into the contest rhumba an inside man they moved him to defensive in this year and he s been outstanding and his knee was the knee that hit<person player="hines ward" race="UNK" position="RB">hines ward</person>s helmet second down and 15 for the bulldogs they scrimmage from just across the rome 14 yard line bubble the throw and second down stream right here in the flat anyway 25 up to the 31st intend roger bulldogs when they get him to put ball in the open

player="ryan taylor" race="UNK" position="LB">taylor</person> very active linebacker group for auburn and in the secondary those corners have been picked on a little bit <person player="antwoine nolan" race="UNK" position="DB">nolan</person> it also larry kasher theyve got a step up big tonight<person player="jeff dunlap" race="UNK" position="DL">jeff dunlap</person>is the man number 76 who

plays electrifies this crowd and there was a flag down and it was thrown at the end of the play doyle jackson the referee tonight theyre gonna pick it up right we have an no flag on the play run the key for georgia tonight is to control the safeties brad were rob eight or<person player="martavius houston" race="UNK" position="DB">martavius houston</person>who s ever in there those two safeties for auburn will be trying to stop<person player="robert edwards" race="UNK" position="RB">robert edwards</person>sneaking up to try to help against the ronny you can see <person player="selma calloway" race="UNK" position="RB">calloway</person> coming up to check on the signal count he s out front blocking those efforts puts a head down to the 50yard line is<person player="ricky neal" race="UNK" position="LB">ricky neal</person>the senior out of daytona florida comes over to make the tackle and the numbers on <person player="robert edwards" race="UNK" position="RB">edwards</person> averaging almost seven yards a carry he s been he s been an outstanding scale back there just hasnt been able to stay healthy talking to jim donnan and the other day he said it s imperative for georgia to get off to a quick start tonight they went to score first score a couple times in fourths auburn not to run the football and try to throw the football to beat him three carries now for<person player="robert edwards" race="UNK" position="RB">robert edwards</person>13 yards remember he lost yardage on the first ball but now when the positive side is <person player="mike bobo" race="UNK" position="QB">bobo</person> with an audible at the line of scrimmage play clock is down between he sets in the pocket and you see my go go go right in front of the bench make the motion of exuberance because as we talked about it early in this broadcast he is at home this year jim donnan palka plays he perfects them <person player="michael greer" race="UNK" position="WR">michael</person> grill in the reception on a deep route which is over the middle larry cancer on the tackle the ball squarely at the 10yard line so with his a first down and from where

position="DB">martavius houston</person>number 25 comes up out of the secondary to make the hit on him that s again that s the main market auburn theyll stick their nose right up there to try to get the seventh eighth guy in the box and georgia with that <person player="patrick pass" race="nonwhite" position="RB">pass</person> over the middle <person player="michael greer" race="UNK" position="WR">michael</person> grimm ill try to hold them back so that they dont get involved in the running game a lot of success inside 220 almost 78% on the season stamp it out over the football in the seven and a half yard line the average again right up the middle inside the five that he s down to the 40 is there to make the tackle and it huge down as far as auburn is concerned because they make a big statement if they force them to go for a field goal here this is just the first drive at georgia s offensive line nothing the auburn defensive front off the ball they are having their way in the running game here on this first drive and as you can see averaging over 10 yards per play well then got caught and get caught substituting tell the time out on the field no score we will be

position="OL">victor</person> ronny probably if you said that someone was the bell cow of this group he certainly would be a big senior out of south carolina 6 5 313 pounds good look at damian <person player="dameyune craig" race="UNK" position="QB">craig</person> we saw him earlier in a upset win at lsu a very big ball game at the southeastern conference this is jesus pisces 240 down to the 43 our up to the 43 racers say as gwen is there to make the tackle then let s look at the starters for the bulldogs from georgia snelling <person player="travis stroud" race="UNK" position="DL">stroud</person> in <person player="derrick byrd" race="UNK" position="DL">derrick</person> buried the down three the linebackers active group here particularly <person player="brandon tolbert" race="UNK" position="LB">tolbert</person> in great <person player="greg bright" race="UNK" position="LB">bright</person> it in the secondary well the guy who gets him lined up to stray seif another one of the seniors and the baby brother s camp and <person player="ronald bailey" race="UNK" position="DB">ronald</person> at the two corners both from folks in joyful jim donnan third down line tonight is the 48 thangka top shot the box get to <person player="patrick pass" race="nonwhite" position="RB">pass</person> away and closer to complete for the first down across midfield at it s four on the receiving a nice job by auburn blocking scheme to get diamond <person player="dameyune craig" race="UNK" position="QB">craig</person> outside everybody tries to keep him inside but youll see this blocking scheme right here by<person player="fred beasley" race="UNK" position="RB">fred beasley</person>to try to get him on the corner where he could throw the football to<person player="hicks poor" race="UNK" position="WR">hicks poor</person>nice move by <person player="chris terry" race="UNK" position="OL">terry</person> bowden and rodney allison the offensive coordinator it was<person player="brandon tolbert" race="UNK" position="LB">brandon tolbert</person>that got hooked inside <person player="dameyune craig" race="UNK" position="QB">craig</person> is 2 of 2 for 10 yards you look at his numbers 15 touchdowns with 11 pitch mississippi state off the left side is gonna go for very short yardage but mike i think for the tiger fans watching at home it may look as though it s kind of boring but i think theyre gonna have to do a bunch of that just to keep georgia honest tonight dont you they really do<person player="fred beasley" race="UNK" position="RB">fred beasley</person>had a oneonone meeting with rodney allison the offensive coordinator in mississippi state game hit yards on four carries and he said we havent run the ball enough to know if we can run the ball he s not being selfish she just wants to be a leader you could see the ranked 109th in division one out of honor 12 running the football brad a senior out of montgomery 62 25 the lone setback again they fake it for the now <person player="dameyune craig" race="UNK" position="QB">craig</person> on the world gets his hand has it complete and that s eric whoa with the first down lost the ball but he lost it out of al ron just like you mentioned oh that running play a play ago wasnt that marvelous of played but it sets up this for demian <person player="dameyune craig" race="UNK" position="QB">craig</person> to fake the ball to<person player="fred beasley" race="UNK" position="RB">fred beasley</person>now you think it s run good fake by damian <person player="dameyune craig" race="UNK" position="QB">craig</person> now he gets outside where he s able to throw the ball and get a good lane to find eric globe her be <person player="kirby smart" race="UNK" position="DB">smart</person> on the tackle you could see the ball came loose but he was well out of bounds so so far what has happened is auburn has been able to get him outside the box and that of course is where damian <person player="dameyune craig" race="UNK" position="QB">craig</person> all kinds of models it will be a first and goal auburn tigers football team when they run the football damian <person player="dameyune craig" race="UNK" position="QB">craig</person> becomes so much more devious he montre <person player="demontray carter" race="UNK" position="RB">carter</person> s had some problems holding on to the football this year jones you the quick burst that he has speed getting into the georgia secondary but this is a good sign for auburn to running the football running it successfully mike they spotted him out at the 11 actually so it s not 1st and goal and you can see <person player="chris terry" race="UNK" position="OL">terry</person> saying get a move on it or were going to get a penalty play clock is down to 7 and now down to 6 <person player="dameyune craig" race="UNK" position="QB">craig</person> looks up at that clock and knows he s got a hustle i formation straight ahead but <person player="fred beasley" race="UNK" position="RB">beasley</person> had hit a kid for five and six yards as he goes to the 5 yard line herbie <person player="kirby smart" race="UNK" position="DB">smart</person> again and right now joe kinds it has to be same my safeties have bacon far too many tackles they really are and<person player="fred beasley" race="UNK" position="RB">fred beasley</person>becomes the most important player beside diamond break on this auburn football team tonight because if he can get started and get this running game where he could keep them honest then damian <person player="dameyune craig" race="UNK" position="QB">craig</person> has a little more success 18 touchdowns seven field goals seven turnovers is inside the 22 here second down the tigers need about four and shop forward almost i think could have the first down <person player="greg bright" race="UNK" position="LB">greg</person> <person player="greg bright" race="UNK" position="LB">greg</person> making the tackle for georgia ron g go back to in her conversation with jim don and the other day he was talking about demian <person player="dameyune craig" race="UNK" position="QB">craig</person> and because theyre developing the running game in this game he said about named ian craigie said he helps his team win more than any other player in the league and how much he admires him because he s carried the weight of this office still in the football he has not had a running game this year so let s see what they come up with it is a first down auburn tigers first down in gold and the ball is 36 inches away georgia leads at 7 and nothing but the tigers trying to answer right back straight ahead with kirk quarterback state cuts down although 62yard drive and of course it was set up with that outstanding picnic return markieff lucas marquis <person player="markeith cooper" race="UNK" position="RB">cooper</person> is the man who gave them great field position <person player="dameyune craig" race="UNK" position="QB">craig</person> led them down there and the extra point attempt coming up and jarrett holmes tries to make this a77 football game

offensive game plan remember nineteen doesnt come back in goes out the window the see 3540 percent of the game plan because he s involved in that much as a quarterback wide receiver bosun s blair

up and saw the pressure from the defensive he just threw it into the ground probably a wise thing but right now on this series after such a great opening drive boy georgia seemed to be total out of

used is a freshman lebron mitchell who s a quarterback freshman out of marietta and he is very very quick and jim said that s a reason weve got him there so our defense could experience that kind of quickness from a quarterback the stream unit gets it on the left side this is <person player="fred beasley" race="UNK" position="RB">beasley</person> behind a blocker at the 40 and then a nice job by georgia to make the stop glen ford a junior on a columbus georgia comes over to make the tackle get me a gain of about eight or nine you always worry about a team when they lost and they havent opened a pan you look at auburn offensively they had one tv in the last 11:40 11 turnovers for the last three games 13 sacks in the last three games and it looks like they finetune their offense after the mississippi state game the tipton s piece a little bit more running in the game but the sack here puts it in bad situation for the ten third down the line to make they need to take it to the georgia

race="UNK" position="DB">ronald bailey</person>number five he was all over <person player="hicks poor" race="UNK" position="WR">hicks</person> floor there with no place to put that ball in jared holmes to attempt this field goal and it s going to be from in the vicinity about 28 29 yards for the right hash mark a 29yard attend this oven tries to break the 775 gets his kick away and he got it sozin time out on the field with 38 seconds left to this opening quarter and our new score the auburn tigers 10 and the georgia bulldogs 7 them now let s take a look at what is at stake in this football game tonight if georgia wins alive for the sec title but they also need the tennessee loss and of course theyre alive for the lions good they want to finish at 10 and 1 a top 7 finish at a barban wins they are alive for the sec west title they need at mississippi state to lose a football game then still is the athletic director at georgia looking on couple of weeks ago it was as big a celebration as this campus has seen in a long time as the largest outdoor cocktail party which is always held in jacksonville a huge win an upset win by georgia and they want it going away over florida and it has this really propelled a lot of excitement in the athens area and also in the entire state of georgia for that matter for right now the auburn tigers have brought them back to earth as they are trailing 10 7 the 38 tip show him in the park in his welcome aboard if you go to the back of the yunso cant tell you well mike certainly can be in a former head coach how valuable guys like jared holmes are no returns have kickoff so far tonight by georgia espn college football jumped up against this thursday night it s the weekend kickoff show at 7:30 eastern then it s off to fort worth texas his smu looks to close out the best season of a decade i guess the horned frogs at tcu thursday night right here on espn thatll be a former auburn quarterbacks last game coach and tcu pat sullivan decided to leave that job joke <person player="hines ward" race="UNK" position="RB">hines</person> pacing the sideline in auburn has to call their second timeout and some of the defensive players looking at each other got it love and error they had 10 and it tough to stop that gorge a bunch of tim so are burned hands only one timeout left as they have had to call q in this opening quarter it s rob pate the freshman out of birmingham who went over to the vent theyre talking about jared holmes anytime your kicker can kick that ball on the end zone and and make you start on the 20yard line and go 80 easy the old coaching axiom of make them go 80 yards and theyll make some mistakes along the way if you dont give them a big play and that s exactly what all burns trying to do defensively not allow the big play so jared holmes has been important here in the first quarter what he really has look at that percentage of touch backs for him almost 65% and let s check in with adrian <person player="karsten bailey" race="UNK" position="WR">karsten</person> while we got a couple of seconds run with the auburn defense back on the field<person player="jimmy brumbaugh" race="UNK" position="DL">jimmy brumbaugh</person>just a thought im certainly one player does not a team make but without him in there theyve had to eliminate now four or five of their blitzes from that package because theyre all predicated on his speed and how quickly he can get around those tackles and tight ends for georgia plus he was averaging ten tackles per game so someone s gotta make fun well now with shannon subtle a senior at lafayette georgia he was 99 well flip back and forth to that defensive install first down for the 20 they roll the pocket <person player="patrick pass" race="nonwhite" position="RB">pass</person> is pop that down immediately is<person player="tony small" race="UNK" position="WR">tony small</person>it looks as though the doctors may be getting ready

like a doctor there but<person player="hines ward" race="UNK" position="RB">hines ward</person>can give you such a big threat as a <person player="patrick pass" race="nonwhite" position="RB">pass</person> receiver but georgia would like to use him at quarterback a little bit tonight they have the option threat the draw threat there s the doctor the first one well two seconds down to one and that is the end of the opening quarter so let s take a timeout and an entertaining first 15 minutes it was the auburn tigers 10 the georgia bulldogs 7 and state farm presents rules of

success well ill go look at that soon hey fellas let s get it cranked up here down by 10 with 13 27 left until halftime and listen to these numbers 46 yards rushing for auburn 83 yards passing for 129 as you look at their starts the number of plays that they have had sustained drives every time theyve got the football look like a team on a mission tonight and this one is going to be returnable he admittedly is part of the food the classic half tries to get it outside hell be tackled at the 24 yard line let s see if<person player="hines ward" race="UNK" position="RB">hines ward</person>here he s talking to his head coach and<person player="hines ward" race="UNK" position="RB">hines ward</person>is going to come into the ball game for the first time tonight so what we have to keep an eye on now first let s check in with adrian about the problem one that he has been pretty simple guys when he starts running the blood starts pumping goes to his head it begins to throb that s what he loses his balance oh yeah he s back in the game but how long he can go and a number of plays gonna be the question here all right well watch him and well have to keep an eye because he lines up at a quarterback and wide receivers come time to run ago ill play the other he s getting left at the latter fitted <person player="takeo spikes" race="nonwhite" position="LB">spikes</person> he s right there to millie im gonna good with mike tirico mike ron near disaster for north carolina final two minutes a punt is blocked clemson on fourth down brandon straighter and for now on green grave lie comes up with the interception for north carolina will finish second in the acc they close with duke next week okay mike that s really an impressive win after the huge mental thing they went through last year when had last week whether a good for the state and away is the official the umpire gets depth from behind as i looked out at the number he got away and went back over the 20 yard line this <person player="patrick pass" race="nonwhite" position="RB">pass</person> rush has to be controlled now by georgia in one of the ways theyd like to control the <person player="patrick pass" race="nonwhite" position="RB">pass</person> rush it puts<person player="hines ward" race="UNK" position="RB">hines ward</person>in a quarterback because then youve got a running thread back there quarterback position but im not sure with adrian s report whether he can actually play the quarterback position just yet ted davis is the umpire now here is <person player="mike bobo" race="UNK" position="QB">bobo</person> lined up in the swap and that s ward that could quarterback that he will run the football straight from the snap you see the pressure and that is a great job by larry pleasure and also by the entire auburn diva but that s what you try to do when the <person player="patrick pass" race="nonwhite" position="RB">pass</person> rush becomes too much for you you insert heinz warden at the quarterback position but it just doesnt look like he could make this decision looks like it was a run all the way and a very good job by<person player="ricky neal" race="UNK" position="LB">ricky neal</person>number 58 getting up in the field making<person player="hines ward" race="UNK" position="RB">hines ward</person>make the move early second three and out for the georgia bulldogs off the side of his foot very <person player="hicks poor" race="UNK" position="WR">poor</person> thick bounds at the forty now picks in the auburn bounce and that thing is going to go dead at the 38 yard line boy when they go bad they go bad that is 17 yards on the kick we talked about this earlier when you have an open date both these teams havent opened a tiny it benefits the team that loses it was you didnt chan stuff micromanage a little bit to try to find the things you know wrong here s the punt off the side of the foot if you if youve won youve got everybody slapping you on the back down you how good john it looks like georgia to start a little slider even after that great flag they have to start this ball game it looks see they pull her about on that opening drive this is only a 17 yard tub to the second time of the row autumn gets it across midfield passing the flag got a complete 64 it s going to be close to the first down as <person player="orantes grant" race="UNK" position="LB">grant</person> who s outside to make the tackle on here now i talked about this early georgians offensive line dominated the first search i can tell you this now rick trick at the offensive line broke fair offer and his team has been the offensive lines could have been people been after them a little bit because they havent been able to run the ball you talked about taking over again now this offensive line is not letting anybody to damian <person player="dameyune craig" race="UNK" position="QB">craig</person> they opening up the running game here are doing a super job to pay about 17 japan on the lead if if you see just got to 11 minutes to play in the opening half and georgia trying to close the goal right here all of a sudden the tigers were the first and goal inside the toy if i was fed these add meat with rotten yelling the offensive coordinator every week because these kind of results he just runs past her be <person player="kirby smart" race="UNK" position="DB">smart</person> to say she who had to draw and now look at the strength as he goes up the football field finally tackled by antonio compliment but easley is off and running in this football game that s one two you could see that lean the five carries 30 guides for healed first and goal the ball just inside of him that picks it back to trident and he turns the corner at the five yard line has not got a bombs by boy hold<person player="demarcus curry" race="UNK" position="OL">demarcus curry</person>number 69 again<person player="fred beasley" race="UNK" position="RB">fred

position="OL">demarcus</person> when he gets around that corner he is a sight to be seen mike answer something for all of us they keep running into the church side of the field and obviously it s been good for the water they see one less player by georgia they get the strong safety to the field so you got one less player what georgia s counting on is that sideline to be a player for them <person player="demontray carter" race="UNK" position="RB">carter</person> four carries 36 yards at a touchdown second and goal they give it to their <person player="fred beasley" race="UNK" position="RB">beasley</person> straight ahead for democracy georgia at the line of scrimmage<person player="fred beasley" race="UNK" position="RB">fred beasley</person>has come to play tonight garak

out of the endzone on that last runner this would even well just think of this ron the last two weeks everybody s been telling georgia how good they are have to be for them well everybody s been

all we want to get them in situations and plays where you keep attacking georgia dont go conservative now a lot of smiles from that auburn defense on the sidelines it for good reason need to take it up to the 45 yard in the shotgun but first to run now close to his leg god whoops in there but he closed his shorts to paly has it complete for the first down nicelooking rowdy had two guys that were

believe strongly in the coach up the transition year is the most difficult year jim collins in his second year now his players know him settle down moses the football georgia has recovered and it was smelling who made the recovery about that all burns did not want to do until times the key is there keeping it in the pocket in the tackle area there s the hip tavis crob caused the fumble george in pretty good shape now offensively the players are down taking the football back again boy that was a clear signal was the hit maybe they called him with his knee down i think youre right mike that has to be what it is so no turnover third down turned out he doesnt care he still got the football the running play has 5 6 &amp; 7 going to take it up close to the 30yard line and all i ever wanted right there if a cat has nine lives they have an extra one because that played just a drawl to set up the punt because they feel great about football yep they feel very very grateful this is the first punt

in the style of running of<person player="robert edwards" race="UNK" position="RB">robert edwards</person>here the first couple of carries he was feeling his way through the hole that really made the offensive coaching for georgia angling because that s the way he was running when he came back from that foot injury originally now he s seen hit the hole hard with the way they want to run okay fock running the under two minutes left until the half and <person player="mike bobo" race="UNK" position="QB">bobo</person> steps in the pocket pressure from the outside that s what nice throws you got nobody in the chaos <person player="takeo spikes" race="nonwhite" position="LB">spikes</person> who say in halves brownie the official said nope that s somebody in the area this was the acc that had been a grounding on that night we were there but the only player i saw there was number 79 <person player="matt stinchcomb" race="UNK" position="OL">matt</person> thinks form a tackle so auburn wanted that call didnt get it i feel applaud the officials on the decision that they made one official thought that was a fumble to monaco but another felt strongly that he saw the knee down and it s good when he overruled if you saw something that the other guy didnt see he particularly hit it might have been the uncited or third god 104 and third down conversions tonight the hall thurston s in georgia they they set up shop inside the 25 it s good for 14 yards or my pogo threw that ball right on the money talked about last year you 16 interceptions 13 touchdowns this year five interceptions

seconds left until halftime let s take a break auburn twenty four to seven quickly let s go back to mike tirico mike ron buick century halftime report coming up will show you scc fans what happened to lsu today how ucla it s as hot as anybody in the country in the story of 77 points in lincoln seeing a couple minutes all right <person player="michael greer" race="UNK" position="WR">michael</person> back into our game now you have to have a couple place called here because it s 29 seconds you dont get in on this first play you got a lineup and have this second call already call it probably have three calls right now good point atlas over the top touchdown georgia so that you go back and review the situation burn all has been really special on special team and all of a sudden the line drive kick to jared collins got a line drive kick away and it cost him because they forgot it on the run and gave him tremendous field position in the low cut on and then mike bargo stepped up to the plate he had to that s the point buy her home stadium clock shows 27 seconds left until halftime and we have a 10point ballgame<person player="robert edwards" race="UNK" position="RB">robert edwards</person>just over the top getting the football yard and a half behind the line of scrimmage and let him go air bomb airborne number 47 it s hit by<person player="martavius houston" race="UNK" position="DB">martavius houston</person>but strong enough to get in the end zone well <person player="martavius houston" race="UNK" position="DB">houston</person> really is to spy on him this boy everywhere arkady s houston<person player="takeo spikes" race="nonwhite" position="LB">takeo spikes</person>have had great half for auburn on defense so george had turned the tables after getting good field position which is something that offer in his head throughout the first half of play for the most part and as you look at martin johnson the kickoff specialist to senior out of columbus georgia and as well as far as kicking the ball into the endzone and now he has the slight breeze behind him <person player="markeith cooper" race="UNK" position="RB">cooper</person> s the man back these the northern tiger touch it it should be a cool cool on the ground <person player="markeith cooper" race="UNK" position="RB">cooper</person> gets a good bounce from the three tries to get outside and he goes down at the twenty six oclock shows 20 seconds left whether the tipper has been slowed by at the separated shoulder and it really put him back some and you can see that time he s gotten what he could but he also went down cant run with the same reckless abandon excellent special teams player for auburn this year wouldnt be surprised the barbarin just ran a running play and then headed for the locker room not thinking a chance of a turtle behind it youre just going to kill the clock that win and talk about it so <person player="dameyune craig" race="UNK" position="QB">craig</person> takes the snap goes down on one knee and that s exactly what will happen able to head to the locker room so theyre standing up cheering here in athens georgia the auburn tiger fans know they got a 10point ball were at halftime with a score auburn 24 and georgia 14 now the des buick century halftime report we go <person player="michael greer" race="UNK" position="WR">michael</person> well ron closer than it was last year at the half when it was a 287 auburn lead and we know what happened later on in that game we welcome you to the buick century halftime report curtain of athletic excellence and he s not about helping his team take a bite out of a competition and sports illustrated names him the best in the nation he s doggone good at his job are the five is the proud champion of a great institution the university of georgia 24 to 14 the auburn tigers leading the georgia bulldogs and did the week off help my god <person player="fred beasley" race="UNK" position="RB">fred</person> i think you have to say that it did because georgia scored the first time they had the football but then the first four times that arbonne had it they put it in the end zone the through the uprights ron auburn looks like a rested team and then the open date did wonders for them again georgia is everybody s tell them how the good they are for the twoweek period and everybody s on auburn how bad they are so you can see how it s worked for auburn it s been an advantage they open tape and the key player has been<person player="fred beasley" race="UNK" position="RB">fred beasley</person>the first half to pull back to the great block on<person player="ronald bailey" race="UNK" position="DB">ronald bailey</person>then he busts out on the draw runs through a tackle by<person player="kirby smart" race="UNK" position="DB">kirby smart</person>then shows you the great effort to get the endzone for the touchdown his leadership his blocking his running has been big tonight and when you look at the stats ron of course the turnover for georgia but i think the biggest stat is right here wasnt coming into the ballgame if you would have said georgia would have been a running team they only have 11 yards rushing auburn a not a running team and they have 74 yards that s been the difference and there is the young man i think s been the biggest difference <person player="brett millican" race="UNK" position="RB">brett</person> <person player="fred beasley" race="UNK" position="RB">beasley</person> with an outstanding first half not only running to football but his leadership abilities and of course i had one play you could see him blocking and of paving the way for a teammate he has done everything that s been asked of him tonight right a senior out of montgomery as you look at damian <person player="dameyune craig" race="UNK" position="QB">craig</person> all see the senior he s out of pritchard alabama second half is underway this is <person player="markeith cooper" race="UNK" position="RB">cooper</person> three yards deep and he will not return auburn s had great field position round and weve always talked every week about the short field if you can plan a short field you can win and anytime you get the ball inside the 50yard line there s a touchdown there s a touchdown the fifty and then that s great field position there and the two times they adam backed up they didnt score average field position 41 yards so you make them work the length of the field and make the mistake let s see what adjustments that joe finds and whose defensive staff made at her home plus the throw on first down batted down at the line of scrimmage and that was<person player="travis stroud" race="UNK" position="DL">travis stroud</person>who got a big mitt up and knocked it down and adrian <person player="karsten bailey" race="UNK" position="WR">karsten</person> let s check in with you rhyme right there is a perfect example of the kind of passion i heard coming out of a georgia locker room at halftime the seniors stood up and they talk passionately about henry remember when we all got together this summer and no one missed the practice no one had any excuses remember this game last year and how he came back and wanted played with that passion in the second half dont get pushed around theyll go off to a good start <person player="travis stroud" race="UNK" position="DL">travis</person> crowd knocking down that first <person player="patrick pass" race="nonwhite" position="RB">pass</person> by damian throw to open the second half a floor this is gonna be good for about three guys maybe for ron bailey comes up defensively if joe pines looks on and he knows it s a third down and the build on what adrian said coming out of halftime when you talked to jim donnan yesterday and joke times they said about this senior group theyve given great leadership they havent had any problems theyre all on course to graduate it s been no crisis this year so they can coax football and play football a trophy for the seniors of georgia and the coaching staff we look at highend world looking on from the sidelines the whole team that we one day mr holder got his past from place and that s it for the first down to carsten bailey boy boy boy <person player="glenn ford" race="UNK" position="DB">glenn</person> four sons over to make the tackle but how many times has <person player="dameyune craig" race="UNK" position="QB">craig</person> done it this year and ron you go back again high school you won two state championships he came to auburn because he wanted to be a quarterback everybody else recruiting as an athlete to see the big throw here the carsten bailing you were talking about joke ninth one screen out but the senior quarterback that will not allow that it s the completion of carsten bailey here the defensive numbers from the first half white the linebacker with seven tackles to georgia <person player="antonio cochran" race="UNK" position="DL">cochran</person> with five tackles and one set seventyfive percent that s the completion percentage that ball is saturday at the latest philips this time muscle wow when you have a better stylist top and damian <person player="dameyune craig" race="UNK" position="QB">craig</person> if you keeping right in the pocket sixfoottall you see the deflection here s where he becomes the problem because it s going to hit<person player="rusty williams" race="UNK" position="RB">rusty williams</person>with a big clash and set up a score here you

williams" race="UNK" position="RB">rusty</person> was close enough the one thing joel coins is done in this ball game and the chips show up here is for this defensive line he s alternating 16th century lineman and he made the point to us yesterday the chorus ball game and he feels like he can get a rush on damien s leg in the third and the fourth quarter because either need defensive lineman i got a linebacker after being closed in the last player andy tobin it is third down and they need to take the ball all the way out to the 41 yard and apart from here be an amazing day running play

bailey bailey will bring it out across the 20 i pointed towards his done this year the beat florida and jim down and he s got his ball pump up in great shape a lot of good senior class but he has started this program down i think it s too bad when a team loses and diminishes doesnt to me what theyve accomplished throughout the year because theyve had a good year i dont think there s any question about that disappoint but here tonight for a number of reasons they wanted to keep it going to go to nine and one possibly finished ten and one and have an opportunity you know this could be eight million dollarplus football game for them but that s gone now and of course that means that the southeastern conference for all intents purposes would only have one team in the alliance in a disappointing day for the other west teams who were hoping that offer would lose lsu loses a notre dame but also seeing this game where auburn is keeping the track though and the head to throw that playoff game if they can win one more next week complete the board check the flag that is down at the 24 eligible receiver downfield lineman or a wide receivers covered up another wide receiver here the standings in the west lsu 580 mississippi state for angie they had an impressive win today all this is freedom fries in alabama and arkansas and the purple of mike s talking about the lsu drops the seven and three but that the something by notre dame today <person player="chris terry" race="UNK" position="OL">terry</person> bowden his guys have to be very very pleased and in fact this is
