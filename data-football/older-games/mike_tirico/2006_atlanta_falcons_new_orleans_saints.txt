[ crowd cheering ] <person player="john carney" race="white" position="K">john carney</person> for the extra point 70 new orleans &gt;&gt; unbelievable how the center was blocked remember, you cant line anybody up over the center and what they do is they just create this giant gap for <person player="steve gleason" race="UNK" position="LB">gleason</person> to go through, and he s on the kicker before he ever gets a chance to get it off watch how close he is to taking off his hands &gt;&gt; you could not script this any better than it just happened for the new orleans saints everybody thought that the wave of emotion would come in with the saints if you were the falcons, the first thing you had to be afraid of is being swept away in that particular wave of emotion that is exactly what happened now and for those people who look to the new orleans saints as something that will uplift them, uplift this city, uplift the entire gulf region, they just had it &gt;&gt; this is like a slap in the face to the atlanta falcons to say, "okay, look, we know it s all about the saints here, but you know what? this is a football game, and we better get ourselves ready for it" &gt;&gt; gleason, who was a big specialteams presence the last few years, came up with the block <person player="curtis deloatch" race="UNK" position="DB">deloatch</person> was waived by the giants that s how he ended up on this roster third year in the league, and that is his first national football league touchdown &gt;&gt; joe, you can say it s a football game for the atlanta falcons, but for people in here and people watching who root for the saints, it s more than a football game, and that delivered on everything they couldve hoped for &gt;&gt; <person player="deangelo hall" race="nonwhite" position="DB">deangelo hall</person>, who is a bottle of excitement as well, is back with <person player="allen rossum" race="nonwhite" position="DB">rossum</person> to return this kick and it comes to the hands of rossum, who fakes the backward pass to <person player="deangelo hall" race="nonwhite" position="DB">hall</person> and is brought down at the 28yard line for a franchise who, in their very first game 1967 returned the opening kickoff in franchise history for a touchdown, on this rebirth night, a moment to remember <person player="michael vick" race="nonwhite" position="QB">vick</person> and the falcons take over from their own 28 and michael runs out the backdoor gain of 3, pushed out of bounds by <person player="fred thomas" race="UNK" position="DB">fred thomas</person> &gt;&gt; even though that was a big play on the blocked punt, sean payton has to be careful that his ball club doesnt get too high cause you can go through an adrenaline depletion where everybody s excited, everybody s emotionally jacked to the heights, and then all of a sudden you get completely drained, and your legs feel like lead and you feel like youre running in cement i guarantee you <person player="reggie bush" race="nonwhite" position="RB">reggie bush</person> s heartbeat is going off the charts right now it s so electric in here they have to stay calm as long as they can and settle into the game against <person player="michael vick" race="nonwhite" position="QB">vick</person> and company &gt;&gt; after an official gain of 4, second and 6 and <person player="michael vick" race="nonwhite" position="QB">vick</person> to the air it is complete for a first down at the 40yard line caught by <person player="michael jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="WR">michael jenkins</person> &gt;&gt; <person player="michael vick" race="nonwhite" position="QB">michael vick</person> looked like an entirely different person when ive had a chance to visit with him yesterday he s so relaxed he looks like he s enjoying the game he s much more disciplined, and he s very decisive, whether he s throwing the ball or running with it, and weve seen that on backtoback plays &gt;&gt; he s been running with it fabulously, but it looks like the saints know he s gonna do that theyre gonna force him to pass, which has been his weakness &gt;&gt; after the game s first first down, theyre waiting for vick, who throws incomplete <person player="josh bullocks" race="nonwhite" position="DB">josh bullocks</person> put on the pressure &gt;&gt; this is what you want to do if youre playing against atlanta he could kill you running he might kill you passing, but history has shown he s only a 51%, 52% passer you want to take his legs out of the game and make him use his arm &gt;&gt; you take the "might" side versus the sure thing &gt;&gt; yeah &gt;&gt; those numbers are in their first two games obviously they ran the ball well, but those are, like, one half stats for brett favre these days, you know? it just looks odd, but they are so effective doing the safest thing in football running it second and 10 he reads the end and hands it to <person player="warrick dunn" race="nonwhite" position="RB">warrick dunn</person>, a gain of 4 here s michele tafoya &gt;&gt; well, mike, the falcons know they are underdogs tonight as <person player="warrick dunn" race="nonwhite" position="RB">warrick dunn</person> put it to us, "it s us against the world the whole country is cheering for the saints" a week ago last sunday after their win, jim mora immediately sat down with his team and began to prepare them for this environment he talked to them again monday then again wednesday, and then he said, "were not talking about it anymore" mora has confidence his team is mature enough to handle this situation and thrive in it mike, well see how they recover from that opening blocked punt &gt;&gt; jim knows all about this place and how special the saints are to new orleans his dad the winningest coach in franchise history he coached here as an assistant for five years third down <person player="michael vick" race="nonwhite" position="QB">vick</person> throwing the deep ball for <person player="ashley lelie" race="UNK" position="WR">ashley lelie</person>, who hauls it in, and hell be marked down at the 8yard line so, lelie, who came via trade from denver, hauls in the long strike of 48 yards &gt;&gt; we make such a big deal about <person player="michael vick" race="nonwhite" position="QB">michael vick</person> the runner, and you sort of poopoo "well, he throws the ball okay" he s now got another weapon in <person player="ashley lelie" race="UNK" position="WR">ashley lelie</person> he has a big, tall, 63" receiver against <person player="mike mckenzie" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mike mckenzie</person> mike tries to get a hand on it this is snuggling <person player="ashley lelie" race="UNK" position="WR">ashley</person> does a nice job of just hauling it in, but the ball was perfectly thrown &gt;&gt; that s why they got lelie, to go deep because mike <person player="michael vick" race="nonwhite" position="QB">vick</person> throws the deep ball better than the short ball, doesnt he? &gt;&gt; you are correct &gt;&gt; yeah, maybe &gt;&gt; <person player="warrick dunn" race="nonwhite" position="RB">dunn</person> goes right side <person player="mike mckenzie" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mike mckenzie</person> there for the tackle gain of about a yard those of you just clicking over, quite a night here in new orleans, not just for guys like <person player="warrick dunn" race="nonwhite" position="RB">warrick dunn</person>, born in this city, but for all the saints, all the city, all the nfl, 13 months after hurricane katrina, this dome, which hosted evacuees who were trying to survive now hosting football, the way this building was meant to do when it was built three decades ago the saints blocked a punt on the fourth snap of the game 1:30 in saints havent run a play on offense falcons trying to tie the game and <person player="michael vick" race="nonwhite" position="QB">vick</person> lofts it up it is incomplete for his security blanket, his tight end <person player="alge crumpler" race="nonwhite" position="TE">alge crumpler</person> <person player="roman harper" race="nonwhite" position="DB">roman harper</person>, the rookie out of alabama, on coverage &gt;&gt; that doesnt seem like much, but <person player="michael vick" race="nonwhite" position="QB">michael vick</person> showed you there that he has touch but also an excellent job of coverage you see now, this is harper, <person player="roman harper" race="nonwhite" position="DB">roman harper</person>, a rookie, who s starting for the saints, having a chance to make a play &gt;&gt; that s a poor percentage of touchdowns in the red zone the reason has been penalties and sacks third and goal blakley, the second tight end, in motion in the slot at the top &gt;&gt; he s still looking for <person player="alge crumpler" race="nonwhite" position="TE">alge crumpler</person> &gt;&gt; and he throws that way <person player="alge crumpler" race="nonwhite" position="TE">crumpler</person> had it go in and out of his hands incomplete &gt;&gt; im sorry you got to catch that &gt;&gt; you have to catch it &gt;&gt; particularly for me ive got him in fantasy tonight that just hurt me &gt;&gt; <person player="alge crumpler" race="nonwhite" position="TE">alge crumpler</person> has been the receiver that <person player="michael vick" race="nonwhite" position="QB">michael vick</person> has thrown the most to this is simple for him this is easy, and he cant put it away &gt;&gt; <person player="morten andersen" race="white" position="K">morten andersen</person>, the alltime leading saints kicker, signed this week by the atlanta falcons [ crowd booing ] he is the oldest player to take the field in the national football league, as he is "welcomed" back home, since 1975, and george blanda the 46yearold from 26 yards &gt;&gt; i hope that s in his range at 46 &gt;&gt; and <person player="morten andersen" race="white" position="K">morten andersen</person>, back on the scoreboard again, his 355th nfl game <person player="michael koenen" race="white" position="P">michael koenen</person> on the kickoff <person player="aaron stecker" race="nonwhite" position="RB">aaron stecker</person> returns tripped up at the 15yard line <person player="omare lowe" race="UNK" position="DB">omare lowe</person>, backup safety, makes the tackle brees, first snap first throw <person player="deuce mcallister" race="UNK" position="RB">deuce mcallister</person> out of the backfield to the 20yard line the tackle made by <person player="michael boley" race="nonwhite" position="LB">michael boley</person> <person player="reggie bush" race="nonwhite" position="RB">reggie bush</person>, who lines up in the backfield or on the side, excuse me he takes that toss and gets to the 25yard line that s the 70th offensive snap <person player="reggie bush" race="nonwhite" position="RB">bush</person> has been on the field for, 22 lining up as a receiver, 48 as the running back &gt;&gt; <person player="reggie bush" race="nonwhite" position="RB">reggie bush</person> really is as advertised, and that s not for me that s when you talk to his teammates they understand the impact that he can have on a football team he had 15 receptions in the first two games, led all running backs in the first two games in receptions been effective as a runner he s really qualified as a space player, somebody that gets to the perimeter and can make things happen &gt;&gt; and you saw a little discomfort for <person player="reggie bush" race="nonwhite" position="RB">reggie</person> after that gain of 5, so <person player="deuce mcallister" race="UNK" position="RB">mcallister</person> is in there for third and a long 2 and <person player="drew brees" race="white" position="QB">brees</person> pass is deflected and incomplete fourth down &gt;&gt; we saw <person player="reggie bush" race="nonwhite" position="RB">reggie bush</person> almost trip when he tried to make his cut the field is soft it s real new turf it hasnt been matted down yet youd almost call it a slow field, if they let grass grow a little bit it s more difficult to be able to plant and cut and that s what you saw in <person player="reggie bush" race="nonwhite" position="RB">reggie bush</person> and it just slows down the speed of the players &gt;&gt; <person player="steve weatherford" race="white" position="P">steve weatherford</person>, the rookie out of illinois, is punting his punt of 39 yards is caught by <person player="allen rossum" race="nonwhite" position="DB">rossum</person> and <person player="allen rossum" race="nonwhite" position="DB">allen rossum</person> is brought down hard at the 42yard line by <person player="omar stoutmire" race="nonwhite" position="DB">omar stoutmire</person> im sure many people who didnt have tickets were around the dome just to soak up some of the atmosphere good field position for atlanta s third drive of this opening quarter and after the fake, <person player="michael vick" race="nonwhite" position="QB">vick</person> throws nearly intercepted he loves crumpler, and the safeties know it <person player="roman harper" race="nonwhite" position="DB">roman harper</person> and <person player="josh bullocks" race="nonwhite" position="DB">josh bullocks</person> in coverage &gt;&gt; and the saints know that he love crumpler, mike what theyre gonna do is both of the safeties are gonna bracket him this is <person player="josh bullocks" race="nonwhite" position="DB">josh bullocks</person> and <person player="roman harper" race="nonwhite" position="DB">roman harper</person> again <person player="alge crumpler" race="nonwhite" position="TE">alge</person> s working to the middle you see <person player="roman harper" race="nonwhite" position="DB">harper</person> close they like <person player="roman harper" race="nonwhite" position="DB">harper</person> alabama guy, started three years down there really won the job and when you think about sean payton, he let his players go out and win jobs just cause you were a veteran didnt mean you had one &gt;&gt; <person player="michael jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="WR">michael jenkins</person>, the slot man, in motion, coming closer to you and <person player="warrick dunn" race="nonwhite" position="RB">dunn</person> waits for the block of <person player="justin griffith" race="nonwhite" position="RB">justin griffith</person> not much room third and 8 receiver slipped pass incomplete <person player="mike mckenzie" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mike mckenzie</person> covering <person player="roddy white" race="nonwhite" position="WR">roddy white</person> &gt;&gt; michael, this turf is gonna be an issue all night even though <person player="mike mckenzie" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mike mckenzie</person> jumped the route, youre gonna see <person player="roddy white" race="nonwhite" position="WR">roddy white</person> have problems with his footing he makes the cut now he tries to plant, and you see his feet slide right out it s gonna force these receivers to run with their body on top of their legs &gt;&gt; <person player="michael koenen" race="white" position="P">michael koenen</person> with the punt <person player="lance moore" race="white" position="WR">lance moore</person> lets it bounce it died and i dont think <person player="omare lowe" race="UNK" position="DB">omare lowe</person> could locate it touchback first time in franchise history the new orleans saints sold out for the entire season, a statement stronger than any of how much the saints mean to this city first three snaps in the threeandout all throws for <person player="drew brees" race="white" position="QB">drew brees</person> and the saints this drive starts after the touchback from the 20 <person player="deuce mcallister" race="UNK" position="RB">deuce mcallister</person> running on a surgically repaired knee, gains 3 to the 23 &gt;&gt; joe, you made the point before that the field is soft and the field isnt working right now how long until a new turf field settles down to where, when you plant and make a cut, like <person player="reggie bush" race="nonwhite" position="RB">reggie bush</person> is doing, you can hold the cut? &gt;&gt; i think itll take at least a year, and there s gonna have to be lots of play you have to treat this field like a muddy, rainy field the little guys with the short strides will be more effective than long striders trying to make cuts on this turf &gt;&gt; so, after the <person player="deuce mcallister" race="UNK" position="RB">mcallister</person> gain of 3, <person player="reggie bush" race="nonwhite" position="RB">bush</person> out in space to the left the attention goes there and the pass goes for a first down to <person player="joe horn" race="UNK" position="WR">joe horn</person> at the 34yard line thrown by <person player="drew brees" race="white" position="QB">drew brees</person>, and as you know, <person player="drew brees" race="white" position="QB">drew brees</person> was with the san diego chargers for four years led them to the playoffs he has come to new orleans in large part he was available in free agency because of the injury he suffered, the major shoulder injury, at the end of last year s season, and <person player="drew brees" race="white" position="QB">brees</person> had great numbers against the packers last week &gt;&gt; when you look at the numbers, 353 yards throwing, mike, you got to figure there s nothing wrong with his arm, and he s back today, so he cant be tired &gt;&gt; and playaction from the 34, looking towards reggie, who s covered, and the pass for <person player="joe horn" race="UNK" position="WR">horn</person> is incomplete when you think about <person player="drew brees" race="white" position="QB">drew brees</person>, guys, we talk about the san diego situation, and obviously he proved in that spot that he could be a leader, he could be a quality quarterback in this league but that whole situation with philip rivers sitting there had to be resolved and finally was, as brees, in free agency, came here, and it s a place, tony, that i think he found, as he worded it, a calling to &gt;&gt; he said when he talked about it, he couldve gone to miami he came here he said, "i got the feeling from new orleans, you are our guy weve been waiting for a guy like you for a long time" and he said, "im signing right now" of course, money helped &gt;&gt; $60 million &gt;&gt; it helped &gt;&gt; <person player="drew brees" race="white" position="QB">brees</person> throws complete to <person player="devery henderson" race="UNK" position="WR">devery henderson</person> the former lsu tiger gets the first down to the 48yard line, a pickup of 14 &gt;&gt; i dont want to make it seem like he was the red cross and didnt take any money cause he took a lot of money, but he also settled into the community he and his wife bought a house on the same block, i believe, where archie manning lives people will tell you that you see him around town, ordering beignets you see he and his wife in the park he said, "im gonna live here youre going to see me here i commit to the city as the team commits to me" &gt;&gt; a couple of first downs here on this drive, and the toss to <person player="reggie bush" race="nonwhite" position="RB">bush</person> looking for space finds <person player="michael boley" race="nonwhite" position="LB">michael boley</person>, good secondyear outside linebacker loss of a few <person player="reggie bush" race="nonwhite" position="RB">bush</person> lost 3 on that one and here he goes again this time hitting it hard and just shy of midfield &gt;&gt; youd like to utilize a guy like <person player="reggie bush" race="nonwhite" position="RB">reggie bush</person>, get him out into space, try and get him to the perimeters screens, draws, quick screens, swing passes, parts of the offense that you can get him outside the turf, i think, will play a factor for him i really believe that this turf does not favor a <person player="reggie bush" race="nonwhite" position="RB">reggie bush</person>, just like a wet field wouldnt he s gonna be better off going north and south than trying to put the cute, quick moves on to slide outside &gt;&gt; not just <person player="reggie bush" race="nonwhite" position="RB">bush</person> but <person player="aaron stecker" race="nonwhite" position="RB">aaron stecker</person>, another running back, is lined up as a receiver here on third and 8, and atlanta s gonna take a timeout here falcons sideline saw something that hasnt been on film yet in that five wide, so they stop it here this is an atlanta defense that has been so stingy all year havent allowed a touchdown so, with the timeout, let s check in with suzy kolber suze? &gt;&gt; well, mike, after that incredible saints start, the blocked punt for a touchdown, offensive coordinator doug marrone gathered his offensive line on the sideline you could see him motioning, "calm down, take a deep breath it s just the beginning we have a long way to go" and that was the theme throughout the sideline sean payton brought his team here friday night he tried to simulate the emotion of tonight im here to tell you, from this vantage point, it would be impossible the energy is off the charts &gt;&gt; yeah, suzy, sean payton, the 42yearold, that kind of fits his profile, keeping his team calm remember, he replaced jim haslett, who was here for six years, the defensive coordinator now for st louis payton the last three years with the cowboys, running bill parcells offense before that, helped the giants as the coordinator with jim fassel get to the super bowl this is the first opportunity as an nfl head coach at age 42 after the atlanta timeout, third and 8 and <person player="drew brees" race="white" position="QB">brees</person> throw is complete to <person player="marques colston" race="nonwhite" position="WR">marques colston</person> penalty marker down back at the quarterback <person player="patrick kerney" race="white" position="DE">patrick kerney</person> was rushing it may add to a 27yard gain let s see &gt;&gt; you just cant touch a quarterback anymore in this league <person player="deangelo hall" race="nonwhite" position="DB">deangelo hall</person> shaken up on the play as well &gt;&gt; personal foul roughing the passer, defense, led with the helmet 15yard penalty from the end of the run first down &gt;&gt; the league has placed an emphasis on protecting quarterbacks if somebody hits them low or you hit them with the crown of your helmet youre going to wind up with a penalty &gt;&gt; meantime, all the way through the timeout, <person player="deangelo hall" race="nonwhite" position="DB">deangelo hall</person>, the pro bowl corner for the falcons, was down, now getting up let s go back to the end of the <person player="marques colston" race="nonwhite" position="WR">colston</person> completion <person player="deangelo hall" race="nonwhite" position="DB">hall</person> diving in &gt;&gt; he hits him not sure whether it s a knee or an ankle not quite certain he stands up and seems to be fine, and now comes off &gt;&gt; with some assistance so you take away one of the best cornerbacks in the nfl &gt;&gt; that really hurts, and it hurts <person player="deangelo hall" race="nonwhite" position="DB">deangelo hall</person> because he was a guy who was gonna play some offense as well tonight remember, he was saying how he wanted to score a touchdown and announce himself to the entire world he was gonna play offense and defense &gt;&gt; well, what you do here if youre the new orleans saints is you figure okay, <person player="allen rossum" race="nonwhite" position="DB">allen rossum</person> is taking his place i like my odds <person player="joe horn" race="UNK" position="WR">joe horn</person> against <person player="allen rossum" race="nonwhite" position="DB">allen rossum</person> &gt;&gt; one of the things <person player="deangelo hall" race="nonwhite" position="DB">deangelo hall</person> said, and i quote, "the world needs to see <person player="deangelo hall" race="nonwhite" position="DB">deangelo hall</person>" im sure he didnt feel they needed to see him like that, being helped off the field &gt;&gt; three receivers, and <person player="lawyer milloy" race="nonwhite" position="DB">lawyer milloy</person> goes out there as the coverage goes to one side this is first down it s in the hands of <person player="reggie bush" race="nonwhite" position="RB">bush</person> it s the hands of <person player="devery henderson" race="UNK" position="WR">devery henderson</person>, the former lsu tiger! in the end zone in the louisiana superdome touchdown, new orleans &gt;&gt; what a block by <person player="drew brees" race="white" position="QB">drew brees</person> to get him into the end zone number 9 hands off now he s out front, leading the reverse watch number 9 throws the block terrific job &gt;&gt; you know, i know that there are social issues we should talk about here and cultural issues but what a start by new orleans for a football game they want to win they get a score on a blocked punt, they get a score on a double reverse the crowd is waiting to explode gets a chance twice early &gt;&gt; quarterback with a bad shoulder throwing a good block &gt;&gt; couldnt write it any better, could not &gt;&gt; extra point added by <person player="john carney" race="white" position="K">carney</person> to make it 143 and suzy s on the sideline with a special new orleans guest, suze &gt;&gt; archie manning has lived here in new orleans since he was drafted by the saints 35 years ago archie, tonight is about rebirth and also reality what would you say is the state of the new orleans community now? &gt;&gt; well, just excited, suzy great anticipation of this day coming we kind of look for good news here, and this is a good news day i think we all want to get back, and we want to get everybody wants their home back, their business back but we got something back today we got our building back and we got our football team back, so that s good news &gt;&gt; how do you express what the saints mean to this community? &gt;&gt; well, like in a lot of places, college towns and some pro places, it s really the pulse of the community, especially during the fall i mean, what happens on sunday kind of dictates people s personality for a week or so and i think especially now that everybody s been depressed, everybody s been through some tough times, and were kind of looking for the saints to give us some joy and happiness &gt;&gt; what can people do who are watching to help? &gt;&gt; pardon me? &gt;&gt; what can people still do to help this community? &gt;&gt; well, there s still a lot of projects we got a lot of problems there s still a lot of projects very charitable things the nonprofits who dont were struggling before really have problems now, so it s easy to find a good project to help &gt;&gt; thanks for joining us, archie &gt;&gt; thanks for being here &gt;&gt; suzy, thank you the kick return by atlanta brings it out to about the 40yard line <person player="jerious norwood" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jerious norwood</person> returned it an injured new orleans saint on the play the injured player, ninkovich, limped off didnt put any power on his right leg <person player="michael vick" race="nonwhite" position="QB">vick</person> and the falcons take over from the 44 and no running room in this early going, it s been all <person player="charles grant" race="nonwhite" position="DE">charles grant</person>, the new orleans defense, and the saints with a couple of big plays &gt;&gt; it s striking what has happened so far a team scores on a blocked punt, a team scores on a double reverse they hold atlanta pretty well on defense, and you hear the crowd explode with glee and i know were going to talk about the hard times that are here because you cant ignore it, but you almost get the feeling that the people here want to ignore it a little bit and just celebrate the fact that their football team is doing something that they havent seen in over a year &gt;&gt; after no gain, second and 10 <person player="warrick dunn" race="nonwhite" position="RB">warrick dunn</person> squirts through the hole and gets to the 48yard line here s michele &gt;&gt; guys, <person player="deangelo hall" race="nonwhite" position="DB">deangelo hall</person> has a left calf injury his return is questionable he s in quite a bit of pain on the sidelines saturday night he got a text message from a buddy, deion sanders, who said, "how bad do you want it? i know youre tired, sore, and unsatisfied, but your family, kids, friends, teammates, and fans are depending on you 60 minutes is all you have" he may not have those 60 minutes, guys &gt;&gt; yeah, <person player="deangelo hall" race="nonwhite" position="DB">hall</person> has become friendly with deion, and the former falcon returned to the falcons camp this summer to work with the dbs, part of that relationship that has grown and continues via text message third and 6 <person player="michael vick" race="nonwhite" position="QB">vick</person> for <person player="alge crumpler" race="nonwhite" position="TE">crumpler</person> broken up again <person player="scott fujita" race="white" position="LB">scott fujita</person>, who s been a lot of places in this first quarter fourth down &gt;&gt; you have to be very impressed with the job that gary gibbs, their defensive coordinator, has done <person player="michael vick" race="nonwhite" position="QB">michael vick</person> has had no passes where a defender hasnt been on top of his receivers it s almost like the defense knows where he wants to go with the football &gt;&gt; <person player="michael koenen" race="white" position="P">koenen</person> s first punt was 56 his first attempted punt was blocked for the opening touchdown and with <person player="lance moore" race="white" position="WR">lance moore</person> back deep to receive, well see if <person player="michael koenen" race="white" position="P">koenen</person> can pin the saints inside their own 20 he cannot 52yard punt, the net 32 <person player="drew brees" race="white" position="QB">drew brees</person> and the saints take over in this battle of 20 teams at the 20 fake to bush, throw to <person player="marques colston" race="nonwhite" position="WR">colston</person> and the third to last player taken in the draft gains 5 the saints have scored two touchdowns in the first quarter at home for the first time in eight years <person player="reggie bush" race="nonwhite" position="RB">bush</person> twisted a yard shy of the first down massive <person player="grady jackson" race="nonwhite" position="DT">grady jackson</person> brings him down &gt;&gt; one of the things that we heard from the atlanta players was the notion that everybody would root against them i mean, they didnt say it with any anger they understood the emotion of this moment, the new orleans saints coming back home for the first time in 14 months and i think outside of atlanta, that s probably true right now, the new orleans saints are not just the team to a lot of people, theyre a cause, and i think people are happy to see them do well &gt;&gt; their coach told them at the start of the season, "you have a chance to do something no team has ever done represent a city as they try to come back" second quarter here in the louisiana superdome, reopened and looking brighter and better than it s ever looked 143, saints leading the falcons mike tirico, tony kornheiser, <person player="joe horn" race="UNK" position="WR">joe</person> theismann in the booth michele tafoya, suzy kolber down on the sideline of course, our "monday night countdown" crew on hand so glad that you have joined us for a unique and memorable evening of "monday night football" <person player="reggie bush" race="nonwhite" position="RB">reggie bush</person> and <person player="deuce mcallister" race="UNK" position="RB">deuce mcallister</person> have been splitting the load that time <person player="deuce mcallister" race="UNK" position="RB">mcallister</person> lined up in the backfield a penalty marker down as pushing and shoving goes on, on the back end of that run to the 46 flag not related to the postplay pushing &gt;&gt; holding, offense, number 70 10yard penalty repeat third down &gt;&gt; left tackle <person player="jammal brown" race="nonwhite" position="OT">jammal brown</person> s penalty wipes away an 18yard gain &gt;&gt; youll see a lot of movement from the new orleans saints going one direction, coming back the other one of their big concerns was the speed of the atlanta falcon defense, one of the fastest in the league so what you want to do is get them running in one direction, cause them to chase and go back that s what happened you saw the wide receiver come around behind <person player="deuce mcallister" race="UNK" position="RB">deuce mcallister</person> takes it up the middle and gashes the defense &gt;&gt; so, after the penalty, well have third and 10 back at the 20 <person player="drew brees" race="white" position="QB">brees</person> fakes it one way has it knocked down by <person player="michael boley" race="nonwhite" position="LB">michael boley</person> and incomplete <person player="drew brees" race="white" position="QB">brees</person> knew he could grab it and catch it and run with it couldnt get there, and it s fourth down &gt;&gt; why? why would he want to? &gt;&gt; that s probably why he let it go &gt;&gt; that s exactly what went through his mind "why would i want to do this?" that s the second time the atlanta falcons have come up with a batted ball on third down &gt;&gt; <person player="steve weatherford" race="white" position="P">weatherford</person> earned the job as punter with mitch berger, who was around but had a groin injury all throughout preseason and was placed on injured reserve so, the rookie line drive here falcons return man <person player="allen rossum" race="nonwhite" position="DB">rossum</person> says, "get away from it," and what results is a 43yard punt with no return so the falcons will take over at the 37 and <person player="michael vick" race="nonwhite" position="QB">vick</person> reads what the defensive end is doing, gives it to <person player="warrick dunn" race="nonwhite" position="RB">warrick dunn</person>, who gets a first down and a gain of a dozen yards so much of the new orleans story <person player="warrick dunn" race="nonwhite" position="RB">warrick dunn</person> in sports illustrated a year ago sports illustrated a year ago called out his fellow players in the national football league, an open letter he said well, some players have contributed, not to the level <person player="warrick dunn" race="nonwhite" position="RB">dunn</person> had hoped, the $85 million, but <person player="warrick dunn" race="nonwhite" position="RB">warrick dunn</person>, who has been such a great humanitarian in this league, called his fellow players out publicly to do what he has been doing and there he gains 6 yards michele tafoya has more on <person player="warrick dunn" race="nonwhite" position="RB">warrick dunn</person> &gt;&gt; well, last night, mike, <person player="warrick dunn" race="nonwhite" position="RB">warrick dunn</person> hired three cars to take him and 25 falcon players and staffers on a 90minute tour of the ninth ward they all wanted to see for themselves up close what hurricane katrina actually has left behind, and they watched it, looked at it in awe today <person player="warrick dunn" race="nonwhite" position="RB">warrick dunn</person> said the tour was one word "surreal" &gt;&gt; and stuart scott pointed out on the pregame, michele, <person player="warrick dunn" race="nonwhite" position="RB">warrick</person> didnt want cameras to go that was not a thing to be seen by everybody it s something he personally wanted to do falcons will back up five here &gt;&gt; false start, offense, number 65 5yard penalty third down &gt;&gt; we have all, the three of us at least, have taken a tour in one form or another of some of the most hardest hit areas in new orleans in the lower ninth ward, what you see often, because the houses have been carted away, what you see is a couple of steps of concrete leading to where a porch used to be we passed 9 or 10 of them theyre almost like unmarked gravestones in a graveyard of a community that no longer exists &gt;&gt; flag of 5 back to second and 10 right back in the belly of <person player="warrick dunn" race="nonwhite" position="RB">dunn</person> and he gets back across midfield, to the 48yard line, where a third down will come up &gt;&gt; that s the third time theyve run that readoption, for lack of a better description they spent some time with people from the ohio state university the coaches came in and took a look michael s gonna read the end person on the line of scrimmage if there s a hole, he s gonna give it if not, hell keep it and turn outside puts a lot of pressure on that end man, whether it s a linebacker or a defensive end &gt;&gt; <person player="michael vick" race="nonwhite" position="QB">vick</person> is 2 of 9 passing 2 of 10 <person player="will smith" race="UNK" position="DE">will smith</person>, out of the ohio state university, knocked it down he s missed his last six passes &gt;&gt; michael sits in the pocket <person player="will smith" race="UNK" position="DE">will smith</person> coming outside, around <person player="wayne gandy" race="UNK" position="OT">gandy</person> both were saints <person player="will smith" race="UNK" position="DE">will smith</person> one of those guys he s had 2 sacks so far this year, 8 1/2 last year the speed part of that defense is their defensive line &gt;&gt; this is what the first two opponents of the falcons were unable to do to make <person player="michael vick" race="nonwhite" position="QB">michael vick</person> pass, and he ran all day, he and <person player="warrick dunn" race="nonwhite" position="RB">dunn</person> &gt;&gt; and <person player="michael koenen" race="white" position="P">michael koenen</person> s punt will be faircaught by moore at the 15yard line those images, those still images, have more power and so much of a different light you just are reminded the moments in time and how painful they were, as people try to come back and try to get some energy back in their city and their lives from their football team firstdown run with <person player="reggie bush" race="nonwhite" position="RB">reggie bush</person> the ball comes out <person player="jammal brown" race="nonwhite" position="OT">jammal brown</person> falls on it, and it was, in fact, ruled on the field a fumble and a recovery by the saints out there at the 23yard line well, one of the many pieces of very, very good work done about the hurricane was done by this man, the great spike lee, whose documentary that aired on hbo, "when the levees broke," it s 4 hours, 20 minutes, and you cant stop watching it spike, it s great to have you here on this very historic night &gt;&gt; historic night ive been at a lot of sporting events, and this is one of the greatest ive been i mean, it s exciting my hairs are on end it s a great night &gt;&gt; here s the seconddown run for <person player="deuce mcallister" race="UNK" position="RB">deuce mcallister</person>, who breaks into the secondary, and <person player="deuce mcallister" race="UNK" position="RB">mcallister</person> is out to the 45yard line, a pickup of 22 for <person player="deuce mcallister" race="UNK" position="RB">deuce</person> &gt;&gt; it s a real nice job by the left side of the offensive line <person player="jammal brown" race="nonwhite" position="OT">jammal brown</person>, number 70, <person player="jamar nesbit" race="nonwhite" position="OG">jamar nesbit</person> they just collapse and what you see is <person player="allen rossum" race="nonwhite" position="DB">allen rossum</person>, as he comes along the formation, trying to stay with <person player="reggie bush" race="nonwhite" position="RB">reggie bush</person>, just takes himself out and then big <person player="deuce mcallister" race="UNK" position="RB">deuce</person> lowers the shoulder when he cant go any further let s everybody know that the knee is okay &gt;&gt; remember when people were worried that <person player="deuce mcallister" race="UNK" position="RB">deuce mcallister</person> would get no carries cause <person player="reggie bush" race="nonwhite" position="RB">reggie bush</person> would get them all? and theyve been splitting time, splitting carries the whole season so far &gt;&gt; on first down from the 45, back to mcallister, who gains about a yard and a half spike, the documentary why did you do it? &gt;&gt; im a filmmaker, and i just wanted to give the people of new orleans a chance to speak to a camera and tell their stories i didnt want a narrator i didnt want to put myself in front of the camera i just wanted to put the people, the great citizens of new orleans, and tell their stories, and that s what we did &gt;&gt; of all the things you saw, all the heartbreaking things and all the things that gave you some joy, im sure, what one stands out the most for you in that long process? &gt;&gt; just the courage of the people, how they continue and i dont want to sound like a doomsayer, but a year later, it s not right here it s still not right &gt;&gt; here s <person player="deuce mcallister" race="UNK" position="RB">mcallister</person> shy of midfield third down coming up &gt;&gt; being from new york, there are a lot of teams that you could root for, and we know who you affiliate with but did you come up with a sense as to why the saints are so important to this community, that a game like this could be, in fact, so uplifting it might not be in other cities? &gt;&gt; it s all they have, really so, it s four hours, then back to your fema trailer and that s not that s not nice &gt;&gt; the power of sports impresses you with what it can do? &gt;&gt; yes, to bring everybody together, and you just got to build on what s happening here tonight &gt;&gt; third down here as new orleans tries to make the most of that <person player="deuce mcallister" race="UNK" position="RB">mcallister</person> play falcons back off to zone and <person player="drew brees" race="white" position="QB">brees</person> comes underneath complete to <person player="marques colston" race="nonwhite" position="WR">marques colston</person> spike, here s a guy right up your alley he s a guy from hofstra, the third to last player taken in the draft, became a rookie starter he s done a terrific job first down at the 40yard line &gt;&gt; not from new york &gt;&gt; <person player="reggie bush" race="nonwhite" position="RB">reggie bush</person> here s an individual who s being asked to do a lot what s your impressions of how much <person player="reggie bush" race="nonwhite" position="RB">reggie</person> has done for the community? &gt;&gt; theyre putting a lot of stuff on <person player="reggie bush" race="nonwhite" position="RB">reggie</person> s shoulder but he s been great, and he s really taken a poor position and trying to galvanize the people and use his celebrity to raise some money and help the people here in this great city &gt;&gt; weve seen so many of those charitable acts, and well continue to show you some of those as the night goes on on first down, <person player="drew brees" race="white" position="QB">brees</person> pumps left, comes back right it was high, but <person player="joe horn" race="UNK" position="WR">joe horn</person> went up to get it may have gotten hurt on that he sure did 17 yards as <person player="joe horn" race="UNK" position="WR">joe</person> comes down, peels himself off the turf &gt;&gt; if there is anybody that is symbolic of what the saint fans appreciate, it s what <person player="joe horn" race="UNK" position="WR">joe horn</person> has done in his time here in the 11 years that he has played in different places, here, he just shows himself lands dead on his back, gets hit right in the butt, and hell lay for a second, but he knows this is just too big "i cant be hurt" and he basically is the kind of guy that just wills himself places &gt;&gt; i agree the fans are just fired up tonight &gt;&gt; <person player="deuce mcallister" race="UNK" position="RB">mcallister</person> inside the tackles goes to the 18yard line &gt;&gt; spike, youre in a situation here where you see what the power of sports can do for almost 100,000 people, 70,000 or whatever but youve seen the depressing elements as well &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; 14 months later, houses not just not rebuilt not even gutted yet are you optimistic or pessimistic with everything you see tonight as opposed to what s outside? &gt;&gt; go ahead, spike tell the truth come on &gt;&gt; im not gonna pull a kanye up here [ laughter ] &gt;&gt; put it out there &gt;&gt; no no kanye west tonight for me, folks america! &gt;&gt; politically correct spike lee i didnt know that id ever say that &gt;&gt; <person player="marques colston" race="nonwhite" position="WR">colston</person> drops the pass there it was tough to catch &gt;&gt; im assuming youd like to see more done is that okay? &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; all right i mean, it s a great city, and i just cant understand why we cannot help our own american citizens, why it took five days to come help our own american citizens &gt;&gt; and yet, a year later, there are lots of things to do but when you look at the downtown area, the business people want everybody to come they want businesses to come back, conventions to come back this is what this dome can be it can be the center of economics &gt;&gt; needless to say, it s a very split and a very complex story without black and white answers, and a lot of issues still to be raised a flag is down here on third down well, spike, you got knicks season revving up here in a month i know youre ready to get back courtside at the garden &gt;&gt; well, first, the yankees are gonna win the wor well, we got to go to the world series with the yankees first &gt;&gt; okay and then you get to basketball &gt;&gt; then we go to basketball &gt;&gt; again, your documentary that hbo aired it was on hboon a selective basis, "when the levees broke" really, it s 4 hours and 20 minutes of the most gripping television pleasure to have you up here thank you &gt;&gt; thank you you guys are doing a great job &gt;&gt; were not gonna let him go without asking about isiah is isiah the savior? come on now &gt;&gt; you have to answer that one &gt;&gt; potential coach of the year you heard it right here &gt;&gt; isiah thomas &gt;&gt; i havent been smoking &gt;&gt; big shoes &gt;&gt; goodbye, spike [ laughter ] isiah thomas, of course, the new york knicks, who took over from tony s friend larry <person player="jammal brown" race="nonwhite" position="OT">brown</person> &gt;&gt; exactly &gt;&gt; thatll be a story to watch in new york meantime here, after the play was stopped, it stays as third and 6 from the 19yard line <person player="drew brees" race="white" position="QB">brees</person> is pressured throws incomplete fans want a flag and get it but the falcons are saying, joe, that it was deflected &gt;&gt; yeah, after the ball was tipped at the line of scrimmage, you can hit a receiver now the officials are doing an excellent job of conferring ed hochuli and his crew do a real nice job of communicating you have the police, the official police, that keep the players away, and then you have a group of two or three that meet and discuss it you see the line of officials keeping the falcon players away &gt;&gt; that s almost as many assistant coaches that some teams have &gt;&gt; pass interference, defense, number 56 the ball will be placed at the spot of the foul first down &gt;&gt; brooking, <person player="keith brooking" race="white" position="LB">keith brooking</person>, was defending <person player="reggie bush" race="nonwhite" position="RB">reggie bush</person>, and jim mora wants to know why the deflection didnt negate the pass interference &gt;&gt; there he is holding on to him but the falcons all believed that that ball was tipped at the line of scrimmage, as does jim mora &gt;&gt; and he s going to throw his red challenge flag here ed hochuli will come over for the conversation with mora it was 75, <person player="roderick coleman" race="nonwhite" position="DT">roderick coleman</person> &gt;&gt; atlanta is challenging the ruling on the field that the ball was not touched before the pass interference &gt;&gt; okay, ed hochuli has gone under the hood for 60 seconds, watched the replay, and here s the call on the challenge by atlanta that the pass interference should be negated because of the deflection &gt;&gt; there s no question that the ball was tipped the question in his mind has to be when &gt;&gt; the ball was tipped by defensive player number 75 before the pass interference, therefore there is no foul on the play by rule it will therefore be an incomplete pass it s fourth and 6 on the 19 no timeouts are charged to atlanta &gt;&gt; and atlanta loses one of its challenges the rare successful challenge joe, explain &gt;&gt; rod coleman, number 75 once this ball is tipped, any contact that <person player="keith brooking" race="white" position="LB">brooking</person> has with <person player="reggie bush" race="nonwhite" position="RB">reggie</person> <person player="jammal brown" race="nonwhite" position="OT">brown</person> doesnt count that was a heck of a play by rod coleman, staying at the line of scrimmage and just reading <person player="drew brees" race="white" position="QB">drew brees</person> eyes &gt;&gt; there s the home run point, <person player="joe horn" race="UNK" position="WR">joe</person> the timing of all that tip, free, pass interference thus flag negated and as i said, jim mora, who uses replay with as little success as almost anyone in terms of head coaches, finally gets one to go his way that is now the 18th challenge and the 4th onfield call overturned that is one of the lower rates of coaches, one of the five lowest among the 45 head coaches who have had 10 challenges, and not just that, dan reeves, who he followed, reeves had a bad record, and his dad, jim mora, had a bad replay record &gt;&gt; well, he got one right &gt;&gt; <person player="john carney" race="white" position="K">john carney</person>, 37yard field goal saints lead by 14 all of the external forces have obviously been explained in our significant story line just from a pure football perspective, i dont think anybody really knew how good new orleans was they are 20 they won two road games you never take that away in the nfl but they won against cleveland and green bay, certainly not teams that come in with a high profile or high expectations for this season the falcons have just run over everyone theyve only rushed for 41 yards thus far in the game and find themselves trailing by 14 points here in the second kickoff return by <person player="jerious norwood" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jerious norwood</person>, the rookie out of mississippi state shown the sideline at the 42, and a 15yard flag tacked on as <person player="curtis deloatch" race="UNK" position="DB">curtis deloatch</person> got too intense, and his head coach, sean payton, is right there to tell him you cant do that or something to that effect &gt;&gt; well, sean payton explained to him, in a game like this, when you have all the momentum in the world, he s out of bounds, now you take and throw him that s just stupid i mean, youre a thirdyear player &gt;&gt; personal foul, unnecessary roughness by the kicking team, number 39 threw him to the ground out of bounds 15yard penalty atlanta s ball first down &gt;&gt; and, joe, you can see why his frustration was there because as <person player="jerious norwood" race="nonwhite" position="RB">norwood</person> is going to stiffarm him, he s up by the headgear of <person player="curtis deloatch" race="UNK" position="DB">deloatch</person> &gt;&gt; i dont care i dont care about frustration you have to use your head at this level you cant in a game like this, with all the emotion, you cant let your emotions get the best of you it doesnt matter who you know, runners can straightarm and grab face masks it doesnt matter &gt;&gt; <person player="michael vick" race="nonwhite" position="QB">michael vick</person> is 2 of 10 passing he s missed his last six but a great opportunity here as <person player="michael vick" race="nonwhite" position="QB">vick</person> loads up and throws incomplete <person player="roman harper" race="nonwhite" position="DB">roman harper</person>, the safety, read that readoption very well second and 10 <person player="michael vick" race="nonwhite" position="QB">vick</person> has space fakes out fujita, but good pursuit by <person player="hollis thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DT">hollis thomas</person>, the former philadelphia eagle third down coming up they run on third and 5 and theyre gonna come up a yard shy with the <person player="justin griffith" race="nonwhite" position="RB">justin griffith</person> carry the fullback getting just his second effort as a ballcarrier &gt;&gt; i wouldnt be surprised if jim mora goes for it here he has such supreme confidence in his running game and youve got <person player="fred mccrary" race="UNK" position="RB">fred mccrary</person> coming in youve got <person player="warrick dunn" race="nonwhite" position="RB">warrick dunn</person> coming in youve got a guy who s quick, who can make moves, and a big battering ram in front of him &gt;&gt; and just from a football strategy point, from here it would be a 51yard field goal and likely out of the range of <person player="morten andersen" race="white" position="K">morten andersen</person>, just added youd have to go back to <person player="michael koenen" race="white" position="P">koenen</person> for a long fieldgoal attempt here and new orleans is gonna take a timeout to discuss fourth and 1 &gt;&gt; considering <person player="morten andersen" race="white" position="K">morten andersen</person> says that his leg is so lively, having sat out for a year or so, that he can bomb them from 50, he also said, though he made a big joke about his age, 46 he said, "they took blood from me the other day, and dust came out" that s a pretty funny line &gt;&gt; you know, this game and this night was full to the top of the cup with story lines when <person player="morten andersen" race="white" position="K">andersen</person> announced this week that he was coming back and the falcons signed him, it was just one more because so many different roads and paths converging here tonight, and so much of the story, in a football game, we talk about the fans, the atmosphere when the game starts, the fans arent part of the story or the stadium really isnt it can get loud, make communication tough but the people are so much a part of the story tonight because the joy on their faces i was walking through the concourse when we got here and people were just so thrilled to be back, looking around at this building, saying, "we have our building back" &gt;&gt; theyve waited an awfully long time for their team to come back to this city how much it means to the city the chance to finally have something good to cheer about, which they havent had, and when they go outside, they dont necessarily have it either &gt;&gt; fourth and 1 and they will choose to throw it and complete it to <person player="alge crumpler" race="nonwhite" position="TE">alge crumpler</person>, tackled by <person player="josh bullocks" race="nonwhite" position="DB">josh bullocks</person> first down at the 16 exactly what you didnt think would happen flag down deep in the secondary let s check the flag &gt;&gt; that s a clutch catch good coverage again, but mr clutch manages to pull it in, <person player="alge crumpler" race="nonwhite" position="TE">alge crumpler</person> he dropped an early touchdown pass he s certainly not gonna drop another one &gt;&gt; 12 men on the field, defense the penalty is declined the play results in a first down &gt;&gt; and that was after a timeout &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; remember, that was after a timeout that the new orleans saints wound up with too many guys on the field &gt;&gt; <person player="scott fujita" race="white" position="LB">scott fujita</person> was trying to call timeout down there did not get it meantime, for vick, it s the first time, back since 2002, that he had gone seven attempts in a row without a completion that stopped at a very opportune time, taking atlanta back into the red zone <person player="jerious norwood" race="nonwhite" position="RB">norwood</person> slips as he tries to cut back <person player="charles grant" race="nonwhite" position="DE">charles grant</person>, fifthyear man out of georgia, former firstround pick &gt;&gt; there s a tremendous amount of pressure on the perimeter players on the defensive line <person player="will smith" race="UNK" position="DE">will smith</person> and <person player="charles grant" race="nonwhite" position="DE">charles grant</person>, as well as scott fajita [ chuckles ] <person player="scott fujita" race="white" position="LB">fujita</person> fajita food on my mind &gt;&gt; hungry? &gt;&gt; yes, i am &gt;&gt; what they have to do is continue to channel <person player="michael vick" race="nonwhite" position="QB">michael vick</person>, <person player="warrick dunn" race="nonwhite" position="RB">warrick dunn</person>, <person player="jerious norwood" race="nonwhite" position="RB">norwood</person> back into the run support, and the back side cant get too antsy &gt;&gt; three receivers come close to you the tight end, crumpler, is at the top of the screen and the throw out to the big guy <person player="alge crumpler" race="nonwhite" position="TE">crumpler</person> tries to make a man miss, and a good, downlow tackle by <person player="fred thomas" race="UNK" position="DB">fred thomas</person> off the corner &gt;&gt; <person player="josh bullocks" race="nonwhite" position="DB">josh bullocks</person>, another one of those draft choices, secondround pick out of nebraska last year with the trials and tribulations that these saints went through, a lot of young guys had to play a lot of people were hurt and it s incredible what they did, the places they practiced in, the buses they had to get on to go eat, to go shower, to go lift jim haslett really did a great job last year just getting these guys to dress &gt;&gt; thank you for correcting me, <person player="joe horn" race="UNK" position="WR">joe</person> <person player="josh bullocks" race="nonwhite" position="DB">bullocks</person> on the tackle, not thomas third and 7 <person player="michael vick" race="nonwhite" position="QB">vick</person> now dancing out lofting it complete to <person player="justin griffith" race="nonwhite" position="RB">griffith</person> and he is shy of the end zone, down at the 2yard line &gt;&gt; there isnt another quarterback in the national football league that can make that play <person player="michael vick" race="nonwhite" position="QB">michael vick</person> is so unique that he can step up and everybody thinks he s gonna run, and then he throws it in reverse very quickly and puts a little touch on it you see him jump up inside <person player="will smith" race="UNK" position="DE">will smith</person> thought he had him all of a sudden he was gone <person player="jerious norwood" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jerious norwood</person> winds up with a big reception &gt;&gt; that s got to be the nightmare scenario, <person player="joe horn" race="UNK" position="WR">joe</person> you can xo and gameplan, and then he does something that they havent put on film before &gt;&gt; especially down here around the goal line, where you have to make quicker decisions &gt;&gt; timeout taken here by atlanta and the coaches are gonna really have to work on their 40 times and their flagthrowing and the challenges they had to come all the way down to get the timeout there &gt;&gt; it s a 30second timeout &gt;&gt; remember, going back to what we saw the opening night of the season, when <person player="nick turnbull" race="UNK" position="DB">nick</person> saban and that flag, and everybody s now said, "hey, you got to make sure you throw your flag" well, the falcons, and i believe it was jim mora, had to sprint all the way down to the referee at the 5yard line, the official at the 5yard line, to get the timeout &gt;&gt; that s why it would be good to hire an assistant coach someone like theismann who can still throw the flag at great distance to make sure the referees are aware of it &gt;&gt; that s right you got, like, 20something coaches now youre gonna have your designated replayflag thrower and the guy who sprints to go get the line judge or side judge &gt;&gt; because you can there s no cap on assistants &gt;&gt; that s right &gt;&gt; you can keep paying &gt;&gt; <person player="michael vick" race="nonwhite" position="QB">michael vick</person> has to be very careful with the exchange because it s very loud, and the center is gonna have to make some big steps, so he s got to be careful to get the ball &gt;&gt; excenter <person player="eric beverly" race="UNK" position="C">eric beverly</person> now at tight end, came in motion <person player="michael vick" race="nonwhite" position="QB">vick</person> brought down <person player="brian young" race="white" position="DE">brian young</person>, the seventhyear veteran, with the sack &gt;&gt; that s <person player="brian young" race="white" position="DE">brian young</person> s fourth sack in the first three games a little playaction fake that s what happens when you slide, get rid of the center, and make the play &gt;&gt; cant run away from everything, can you? &gt;&gt; as long as the ends box you in, those big guys will eat you alive &gt;&gt; you mentioned, joe, that s his fourth sack in 2 1/2 games he had 13 in his first six years in the nfl second and goal in the belly of <person player="warrick dunn" race="nonwhite" position="RB">dunn</person> to the 7, and to the 2minute warning as young made that tackle flag down here before the 2minute warning it was thrown back in the secondary &gt;&gt; that s the 2minute warning 2 minutes &gt;&gt; all right maybe the flag just slipped out third and goal for <person player="michael vick" race="nonwhite" position="QB">michael vick</person> and the falcons, trailing by 14 four in the pattern, and <person player="michael vick" race="nonwhite" position="QB">vick</person> throws and it s deflected and incomplete intended for <person player="fred thomas" race="UNK" position="DB">fred thomas</person> on the coverage fieldgoal attempt coming up &gt;&gt; <person player="michael vick" race="nonwhite" position="QB">michael vick</person> has had absolutely no place to put the football to his receivers nice job by <person player="fred thomas" race="UNK" position="DB">fred thomas</person> on <person player="ashley lelie" race="UNK" position="WR">ashley lelie</person> he tries to throw to the back shoulder, but <person player="fred thomas" race="UNK" position="DB">fred thomas</person> just didnt give him enough room to be able to make the throw &gt;&gt; you know what some of this proves, joe? is that both teams have coaches, that the other team is watching what youve done well, and theyre coming up with something to stop it &gt;&gt; they call that film, tony, film that s what they work on &gt;&gt; <person player="morten andersen" race="white" position="K">morten andersen</person>, good from 26, is blocked on this 25yard attempt! what a night it s been for the special teams <person player="josh bullocks" race="nonwhite" position="DB">josh bullocks</person>, the safety, came in to get that, and <person player="joe horn" race="UNK" position="WR">joe</person> decamillis, the specialteams coach, and his crew has had a tough first half &gt;&gt; we knew that his range was 26 at least, so you had to figure 25 was good &gt;&gt; but you have to get it airborne number 29, the second on the right, <person player="josh bullocks" race="nonwhite" position="DB">josh bullocks</person> youll see him come inside terrific angle looked an awful lot like the punt block, where the guy making the block is right in front of the kicker nice job leaping through, making the block &gt;&gt; so, a couple of protection breakdowns, and look at the saints sideline &gt;&gt; how good do you feel if youre a member of the new orleans saints, if youre a fan of the new orleans saints, if you have plugged into this story, obviously, about katrina and said to yourself, "they could use a little bit of good luck"? how good do you feel right now? &gt;&gt; and with two timeouts, i dont believe sean payton is gonna go into a shell i think you come out and run the ball, see what you can get, and you try and get into a fieldgoal position &gt;&gt; atlanta has one timeout left <person player="deuce mcallister" race="UNK" position="RB">deuce mcallister</person> takes it to the 18yard line <person player="jason webster" race="UNK" position="DB">jason webster</person> and <person player="lawyer milloy" race="nonwhite" position="DB">lawyer milloy</person> there on the tackle tough half for vick, who has missed on 10 of his 15 passes he s been so effective running only two attempts for 9 yards &gt;&gt; i will say this where <person player="michael vick" race="nonwhite" position="QB">michael vick</person> has tried to throw the football to his receivers, i dont know if any quarterback in the league wouldve been able to complete them the saints have been right on top of them, and the field has negated the speed of the atlanta falcons &gt;&gt; second and 5 from the 18 <person player="drew brees" race="white" position="QB">brees</person> throws complete to <person player="marques colston" race="nonwhite" position="WR">colston</person> and the first down for <person player="marques colston" race="nonwhite" position="WR">marques</person> here s michele tafoya &gt;&gt; mike, after the blocked fieldgoal attempt, the looks in the players eyes on this falcons sideline instantly changed there was a look of shock, of being stunned jim mora told us he believes his players were mature enough to handle this environment they all thought they were prepared for it but im not sure they knew exactly what they were getting into, guys &gt;&gt; michele, it s an interesting point &gt;&gt; theyve also forgotten, michele, that the saints arent what they were a year ago this is a 20 football team also &gt;&gt; they may equal their 3win total all year <person player="reggie bush" race="nonwhite" position="RB">reggie bush</person> right at the firstdown line, and well see here, with 59 seconds payton continuing to let the clock run &gt;&gt; you can talk about that, how theyre a 20 football team, and that s all well and good but theyre scoring on trick plays, theyre batting down kick attempts and stuff like that everything works for them right now, everything &gt;&gt; right back to <person player="reggie bush" race="nonwhite" position="RB">reggie</person> to the 39, and now with that first down in tow, and comfortable range here, payton s gonna take a timeout out of the shadow of the goalpost at the 39 suzy? &gt;&gt; mike, when sean payton took this job, he knew he would have to change the culture, and that meant a total overhaul 24 players on the roster tonight that werent here last year tight end <person player="ernie conwell" race="white" position="TE">ernie conwell</person> told us how he appreciates that, that this is a team of good men, and he shared with us the way payton conveyed the message during training camp he held up a banner from 2004, the us olympic basketball team, a group of superstars who werent very successful sean said it s not always the most talented group of men it s the right group of men that s what it takes to be successful &gt;&gt; suzy, that 2004 us olympic basketball team that had just an awful time in athens, you remember the losses that they took, to puerto rico, argentina, and lithuania, two years after the us fell on its face in the world championships in indianapolis bush, screen <person player="reggie bush" race="nonwhite" position="RB">reggie</person> to the sideline at the 41 here, new orleans, one timeout, 33 seconds, and operating from their own 42 flag down as <person player="drew brees" race="white" position="QB">brees</person> pass, intended for <person player="devery henderson" race="UNK" position="WR">devery henderson</person>, is incomplete &gt;&gt; that s gonna be against <person player="jammal brown" race="nonwhite" position="OT">jammal brown</person>, the left tackle, moving a little too quick &gt;&gt; illegal formation, offense, number 70 lined up in the backfield &gt;&gt; ooh! &gt;&gt; 5yard penalty repeat second down &gt;&gt; he wants to be a running back &gt;&gt; he broke that line of helmets there that you have to maintain did not get that well, the falcons against the panthers and buccaneers, combined those teams only ran it for 105 yards and no touchdowns atlanta came into this third week of the year one of three teams not to allow a touchdown well, tonight new orleans has already run for 75 yards and two touchdowns scored really, one allowed by the defense, one coming on the specialteams play, but it was the first touchdown allowed by atlanta all year, keeping safe the 1937 bears, who are the last team in nfl history to go three games without a touchdown being scored upon them baltimore, denver, and atlanta had a chance to take them out of the books this week and have not &gt;&gt; i think i rooted for them when i was small, the 37 bears &gt;&gt; the clock should read 28 seconds &gt;&gt; 5second runoff on the penalty on new orleans while we have a second, you can look at the numbers from this first half &gt;&gt; they need to pick up 40 more yards, the saints do, to give <person player="john carney" race="white" position="K">carney</person> an opportunity at a 50yard field goal &gt;&gt; and one timeout and 28 seconds to try to accomplish that and a handoff inside to <person player="reggie bush" race="nonwhite" position="RB">bush</person> he gets to the edge cant get out of bounds as <person player="reggie bush" race="nonwhite" position="RB">reggie</person> is taken down at the 49yard line and new orleans takes its final timeout &gt;&gt; <person player="reggie bush" race="nonwhite" position="RB">reggie</person> is so electric the short steps when he cuts, he doesnt get his legs out away from his body he cuts with his legs underneath his body &gt;&gt; i would hope so &gt;&gt; the difference is he s a highstepper his knees go up and down they dont slide out tall receivers have a little the big guys have it more difficult &gt;&gt; how do you like those gold shoes he s wearing tonight? &gt;&gt; new ones &gt;&gt; guys, <person player="reggie bush" race="nonwhite" position="RB">reggie bush</person>, of course, was in the news because of what happened when he was at usc as an eligible studentathlete while playing at usc did <person player="reggie bush" race="nonwhite" position="RB">reggie</person> and his family accept financial benefits from potential agents to try to sign him once he turned pro? if that happened, then it s an ncaa violation national championship and the heisman come into question they question who paid for several things, including a hotel stay and a used car for <person player="reggie bush" race="nonwhite" position="RB">reggie</person> ten days ago, there was an investigative story <person player="reggie bush" race="nonwhite" position="RB">reggie</person> s attorney we met with him yesterday knocked down some of the claims <person player="drew brees" race="white" position="QB">brees</person> here with 19 seconds, pitches it to bush, who runs to the sideline and gets there at the 49yard line to stop the clock <person player="kevin mathis" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mathis</person> took a shot at <person player="joe horn" race="UNK" position="WR">joe horn</person>, and that was a bad penalty adds 15 yards, and the saints are gonna be very close to fieldgoal range and <person player="joe horn" race="UNK" position="WR">joe horn</person> has to be careful not to get it back as he goes mouth to mouth with <person player="deangelo hall" race="nonwhite" position="DB">deangelo hall</person> &gt;&gt; both of these teams are wrapped up in the emotion of the night &gt;&gt; after the play was over, personal foul unnecessary roughness, defense, number 23 15yard penalty first down &gt;&gt; good block by <person player="joe horn" race="UNK" position="WR">joe horn</person> now he comes back and pushes him <person player="joe horn" race="UNK" position="WR">joe horn</person> is protecting his partner he s protecting his running back now, <person player="joe horn" race="UNK" position="WR">joe</person> is never one not to finish a conversation, so he s gonna say something &gt;&gt; yeah, speaking of finishing, let me finish the <person player="reggie bush" race="nonwhite" position="RB">reggie bush</person> story we talked to <person player="reggie bush" race="nonwhite" position="RB">reggie</person> s agent yesterday he again poked some holes in some of the claims that were in that printed story from yahoo sports online we asked if theyre gonna cooperate with the pac10 or the ncaa investigation he said there s litigation still out there potentially, so theyll consider cooperating with that investigation, only if it s in <person player="reggie bush" race="nonwhite" position="RB">reggie</person> s best interest so that cleans up some of the <person player="reggie bush" race="nonwhite" position="RB">reggie bush</person> story that has been out there really, not a lot to advance the story at this point <person player="drew brees" race="white" position="QB">brees</person> no timeouts left throws incomplete &gt;&gt; what does stay out there, though, is the notion, the possibility that <person player="reggie bush" race="nonwhite" position="RB">reggie bush</person> s family accepted either you know, free rent for some long period of time last year, the house that they were moved out of when the story first broke, and you have to identify were they ever charged rent? if they were, how did they pay rent? that sort of hangs out there, and that would be an improper benefit in most people s eyes if that were the case &gt;&gt; yeah, and it s a college football story because that s the impact it s not a story down here in new orleans because of all the things <person player="reggie bush" race="nonwhite" position="RB">reggie</person> has reached out to the community at their time of need before playing a game in here final seconds brees, without timeouts, has to get to the sidelines, and they almost lost yardage on the pass to <person player="devery henderson" race="UNK" position="WR">henderson</person> so, from here, youre looking at a 51yard fieldgoal attempt with 5 seconds left, and all <person player="devery henderson" race="UNK" position="WR">henderson</person> can do is say, "hey, i had to get out of bounds, gaining or losing" &gt;&gt; no point not trying it &gt;&gt; 51 is a makable distance for <person player="john carney" race="white" position="K">john carney</person> in preseason excuse me in pregame he kicked a 53yarder &gt;&gt; so, <person player="john carney" race="white" position="K">john carney</person>, this fountain of kicking youth tonight at age 42, with <person player="morten andersen" race="white" position="K">morten andersen</person> on the other side, comes out to attempt this field goal at the back end of the half &gt;&gt; it s the oldest two kickers since the rockettes had a reunion from the 1945 rockettes &gt;&gt; from 51 on line is it long enough? you betcha &gt;&gt; [ laughs ] how does everything go right, right now, for the new orleans saints in their first game here in 14 months? &gt;&gt; as we begin the third quarter here in the reopened louisiana superdome suzy kolber, michele tafoya on the field mike tirico, tony kornheiser, <person player="joe horn" race="UNK" position="WR">joe</person> theismann in the booth <person player="michael koenen" race="white" position="P">michael koenen</person> kicking off for the falcons and <person player="aaron stecker" race="nonwhite" position="RB">aaron stecker</person> will take it 2 yards deep in the end zone hurdling a tackler, he makes a man miss, and brings it out to the 25yard line, where <person player="fred mccrary" race="UNK" position="RB">fred mccrary</person>, the fullback, makes the stop the delay after the kickoff and before the first play <person player="john leake" race="UNK" position="LB">john leake</person> was shaken up for the falcons he walked off under his own power on first down, <person player="drew brees" race="white" position="QB">brees</person> throws complete to <person player="marques colston" race="nonwhite" position="WR">marques colston</person> again turns down tackles and takes it into falcons territory first down, gain of 29 &gt;&gt; <person player="marques colston" race="nonwhite" position="WR">marques colston</person> is such a wonderful story, a seventhround draft choice everybody liked him they liked him in the third they liked him in the fourth they liked him in the fifth nobody could pull the trigger on him &gt;&gt; they mustve loved him in the seventh &gt;&gt; oh, they absolutely did out of hofstra, they felt like all he could do was run the bubble screen in college and run fast but with each day in practice, he got better and better &gt;&gt; sean payton, quoting his old coach bill parcells, "bill taught us unbias yourself as to how we acquired the player" you look at a guy who was a very low draft choice, you say, "how could he become a starter?" &gt;&gt; <person player="drew brees" race="white" position="QB">drew brees</person> and his wife, brittany, after they found out new orleans was their new football home, they have infused themselves into this city, purchasing a home in the uptown area, the truly new orleans area, where archie and olivia manning, the first football couple of this city, still call home <person player="drew brees" race="white" position="QB">brees</person> pumps deep gets it to <person player="deuce mcallister" race="UNK" position="RB">mcallister</person> to the 39yard line, 3 shy of a first down look at the numbers here for the first 31 minutes <person player="drew brees" race="white" position="QB">brees</person> 14 of 20, very efficient night <person player="deuce mcallister" race="UNK" position="RB">mcallister</person> averaging right around 65 a carry <person player="reggie bush" race="nonwhite" position="RB">reggie bush</person> has touched it from scrimmage 10 times, averaging just under 5 per touch &gt;&gt; and also, you have to be impressed with the offensive line of the new orleans saints all five are new starters, and <person player="drew brees" race="white" position="QB">drew brees</person> went through this in san diego a few years back when they started a whole new group, and theyre starting to gel theyve done a terrific job giving him a chance to stand back there and throw the ball &gt;&gt; <person player="deuce mcallister" race="UNK" position="RB">mcallister</person> runs for a first down <person player="michael boley" race="nonwhite" position="LB">michael boley</person> and <person player="demorrio williams" race="UNK" position="LB">demorrio williams</person> made the tackle and we should reiterate that atlanta is without two starters on defense here again tonight ed hartwell, their middle linebacker, out with both knees that were scoped in late august they hope to get him back next week same true for the passrushing defensive end <person player="john abraham" race="nonwhite" position="LB">john abraham</person>, who is back in atlanta, missing his second game with a groin injury &gt;&gt; when we came into this game, we wondered aloud everybody did how good was new orleans the new orleans players wondered that as well <person player="ernie conwell" race="white" position="TE">ernie conwell</person> said, "on a scale of 10, were a 6 this will be a real good gauge for where were at" theyre above a 6 right now &gt;&gt; good job just to make sure that the handoff was successful there <person player="keith brooking" race="white" position="LB">keith brooking</person> making the tackle &gt;&gt; the best way to defend <person player="michael vick" race="nonwhite" position="QB">michael vick</person> is what the saints are doing now, is having him standing on the sidelines in the first two games, the atlanta falcons had an advantage in time of possession by 10 minutes, roughly 35 to 25 when you look at this game, im sure that the balance goes in favor of the saints, and that s another factor, tony, when we talk about all the things that are going their way, to be able to control the line of scrimmage and run the ball &gt;&gt; <person player="michael vick" race="nonwhite" position="QB">vick</person> certainly does not look happy sitting there &gt;&gt; <person player="joe horn" race="UNK" position="WR">joe horn</person> in motion <person player="drew brees" race="white" position="QB">brees</person> to <person player="joe horn" race="UNK" position="WR">horn</person> first down, 13yard line &gt;&gt; who says you have to be 65" to play quarterback in the national football league? <person player="joe horn" race="UNK" position="WR">joe horn</person> finds the soft belly of the defense, right behind the linebackers, right in front of <person player="lawyer milloy" race="nonwhite" position="DB">lawyer milloy</person> wonderful lane to throw the football for <person player="drew brees" race="white" position="QB">drew brees</person> &gt;&gt; horn, who had a disappointing year last year, in part the injury that he suffered, a hamstring certainly in large part the difficult circumstances he took the field with every week <person player="reggie bush" race="nonwhite" position="RB">bush</person> [ whistle blows ] to the 12 the ball came out, but the whistle, as you heard, had already sounded &gt;&gt; those are the type of plays, michael, that the coaches want to see <person player="reggie bush" race="nonwhite" position="RB">reggie bush</person> run they dont want to have him try and turn every play into a highlight sometime you have to put your head down, take the 2 or 3 yards, and then go back and do it again the discipline to run inside as well is only going to benefit him as he matures and grows into this game &gt;&gt; merril hoge was talking about that on our "monday night" "sportscenter" early this afternoon keep your team on schedule second and 8 much better than second and 13 when you try to make the homerun play <person player="drew brees" race="white" position="QB">brees</person> has to take a second timeout in this drive and for those of us who have been to final fours and super bowls and other events in this city, bourbon street looks just like bourbon street used to look &gt;&gt; and the natives want you to come here they need the money they need the help they want the tourist dollar theyve always been able to depend on &gt;&gt; second and 8 out of the second called timeout by the saints on this drive brees, quick toss <person player="marques colston" race="nonwhite" position="WR">colston</person> caught it at the 5 <person player="jason webster" race="UNK" position="DB">jason webster</person> makes the tackle to set up third and 2 &gt;&gt; take advantage of somebody that s 64" and 230 pounds those are the kind of things that he caught in college, the real quick im very impressed with the way he catches the ball in his hands &gt;&gt; as opposed to his feet? &gt;&gt; no not his feet, you dummy &gt;&gt; the body &gt;&gt; with the body youve been around this game long enough &gt;&gt; he s a hofstra kid come on, im a long island boy myself of course im rooting for him &gt;&gt; you have to keep your feet underneath you remember that &gt;&gt; [ laughs ] &gt;&gt; <person player="deuce mcallister" race="UNK" position="RB">deuce mcallister</person> in the backfield <person player="mike karney" race="UNK" position="RB">mike karney</person>, the fullback, leads the way mcallister, first down and goal &gt;&gt;

mine wouldve worked &gt;&gt; and the saints have an extrapointsized field goal here if they so choose it would make it a 20point lead and would force atlanta &gt;&gt; you kick it &gt;&gt; to score three touchdowns as opposed to two field goals and a touchdown &gt;&gt; no question you have to kick it here you cant run the risk of losing all of the emotion and momentum that has been built up for you as the new orleans saints &gt;&gt; no, the fans quickly, when they came out to kick, stopped chanting for them to go for it they realize that &gt;&gt; this is right on that 2yard mark, so it becomes an extra point that s worth 3 <person player="john carney" race="white" position="K">carney</person> bangs it through, and it s a terrific drive you come out of the locker room you know <person player="michael vick" race="nonwhite" position="QB">michael vick</person> s salivating to get his hands on the ball you take half the quarter, get points, and take a 20point lead music the soul of this city, so present every alley and street you walk down theyre trying to keep it going <person player="allen rossum" race="nonwhite" position="DB">allen rossum</person>, kickoff return pulled down at the 25yard line and one of the landmarks of new orleans, emerils a lot of the waitstaff is now gathered to watch the football game as well, and hi to all you folks so many of the people of new orleans, and this is a people of new orleans night, as the saints lead by 20 first possession for the falcons <person player="warrick dunn" race="nonwhite" position="RB">warrick dunn</person> almost busted through got to the 30yard line three <person player="john carney" race="white" position="K">john carney</person> field goals have made it 233 and the baton rouge, louisianaraised <person player="warrick dunn" race="nonwhite" position="RB">dunn</person> and the falcons have been stymied by new orleans here tonight third down coming up &gt;&gt; the interior line of the new orleans saints has really done a terrific job handling the zone blocking concept of the falcons <person player="hollis thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DT">hollis thomas</person> in the middle, number 99 <person player="brian young" race="white" position="DE">brian young</person> either seems to be around the ballcarrier or in <person player="michael vick" race="nonwhite" position="QB">michael vick</person> s face an awful lot &gt;&gt; look at all those saints crowding the line many back in coverage <person player="michael vick" race="nonwhite" position="QB">vick</person> from behind still able to stand in the pocket, but throws incomplete for a blanketed <person player="alge crumpler" race="nonwhite" position="TE">alge crumpler</person> the falcons have converted just 2 of 10 third downs tonight &gt;&gt; for all <person player="michael vick" race="nonwhite" position="QB">michael vick</person> s great talent, the picture that we see of him tonight is one of frustration as he sits on the bench it s difficult for him to get back onto the field because the saints possess the ball, and when he does get there, he is neither running nor passing with anywhere near the amount of yards we have seen in the first two games from him &gt;&gt; meantime, one of the saints defensive backs was injured deep downfield on the back end of the play the falcon faces have been frustrated faces as they sit on the sideline during the timeout injury to <person player="fred thomas" race="UNK" position="DB">fred thomas</person>, the starting corner for the saints but he jogged off after sitting down for about 40 seconds on the field under his own power falcons have had seven possessions, fourth threeandout and <person player="michael koenen" race="white" position="P">michael koenen</person> to kick again 50yard kick, and here s <person player="lance moore" race="white" position="WR">lance moore</person> from the 19 hell take it out to the 28yard line here s suzy kolber &gt;&gt; well, mike, one of the major topics of discussion around new orleans that a majority of the funding that went to rebuild the superdome came from fema, which raised the question, why rebuild a stadium before you rebuild homes? well, i spoke with the fema director today, who spent five days in the dome after katrina he explained the city doesnt rebound without an economic base new orleans survives on tourism 10 to 12 million will be poured into the community just because this game is being played tonight now, of course, there s a delicate balance of what you do first, but what s first impacts what s second and third homes, schools, the police force before the residents can come back, people who work in the hotels and the restaurants, you have to bring business back tonight puts the focus back on the city in a positive way so it can turn the corner and the tourists will come back &gt;&gt; and, suzy, after we started talking about that today, as i went out to get a poboy sandwich and just do the new orleans lunchtype things, the line at mother s to get in was long that s the question i took to people, suzy, because i wanted to hear from the people of new orleans, and i asked 20 at completely random, nonscientific sample, and 20 out of 20 people said, "of course we needed to rebuild the dome if not, if the saints go, if the final four doesnt come back," if a super bowl they hope somewhere down the line, if all those things dont come back, that s not gonna show new orleans as the city it s been for a long time "what are we gonna do?" because tourism is such an important part of this city there was a 5yard penalty on the falcons, so new orleans had the option tack it on or rekick they choose the rekick to see if they can get better field position <person player="michael koenen" race="white" position="P">koenen</person> hits his best punt of the night, and it goes down at the 23yard line part of new orleans coming back is some of the music we talked about michele is with one of the people instrumental in that &gt;&gt; yeah, harry connick jr i mean, when you think new orleans and you think music, you think of harry tell us a little bit about musicians village in the upper ninth ward what is it? &gt;&gt; well, it s the first and only reconstruction effort on a major level in new orleans, and we have over 30 houses that are constructed now, three families that are there this city was very slow to get back on its feet, and myself and branford marsalis and my manager, ann marie wilkins, decided were gonna get some musicians, who are the heart of the culture of this city, back into town so we started musicians village it started with one house, and were moving on, and it s just terrific it s right there in the heart of the lower ninth ward, which is the heart of our city &gt;&gt; now, as a guy who was born and raised here, what is it gonna take to get this place back to what you remember it being? &gt;&gt; well, this is probably the greatest thing that could happen, is to have this great team playing in this great dome in this great city right now, and this game is a great bonus but we need people to come see us we need people to spend their money here, to come stay in the hotels, eat at the restaurants it s my favorite city in the world, and to have people come back and visit and help us and boost our economy, that s really what we need right now &gt;&gt; now, be honest youve been watching this game punt gets blocked for a touchdown what are you thinking? &gt;&gt; ii dont even know what to say im im so blown away right now i mean, this is sick i mean, a blocked field goal, a blocked punt this is crazy, man and everybody s getting a chance to play it s crazy, insane &gt;&gt; i think the falcons think so, too harry connick jr, thank you so much good luck &gt;&gt; thanks &gt;&gt; thank you, michele <person player="reggie bush" race="nonwhite" position="RB">reggie bush</person> a run for a loss of yard <person player="deuce mcallister" race="UNK" position="RB">deuce mcallister</person>, on that little screen, gets the yard back well have third and 10 coming up with 4 1/2 left in the third &gt;&gt; we were talking before about fema putting in money to the superdome uh, there s nobody in this city who is running away from all the ills of the city, all the gutted houses in the city, all the miles and miles of destruction but what they are saying harry connick said, what they all say is, "we got to start with something that builds the city back up," and the saints mean that much to this city, as they dont in other cities where there s a multiplicity of sports teams &gt;&gt; third and 10 <person player="drew brees" race="white" position="QB">brees</person> settles, throws just about a yard shy of the first down, to the 32yard line and on fourth down, theyll have to kick it away and a little instruction on the field there for the rookie <person player="reggie bush" race="nonwhite" position="RB">reggie</person> <person player="steve weatherford" race="white" position="P">weatherford</person> back on to punt good punt <person player="allen rossum" race="nonwhite" position="DB">allen rossum</person> from the 16 flag down he s down at the 22 what a boot by <person player="steve weatherford" race="white" position="P">weatherford</person> it was 66 yards, and let s check the flag &gt;&gt; during the return, holding by the receiving team, number 81 half the distance to the goal atlanta keeps the ball first down &gt;&gt; if it happened in the league on sunday, our guys, the best in the business, break it down for you leading up to kickoff on monday night <person player="michael vick" race="nonwhite" position="QB">vick</person> from inside his own 10 to <person player="alge crumpler" race="nonwhite" position="TE">crumpler</person> at the 24 first down &gt;&gt; you have to figure that the atlanta falcons have to score on every drive the most theyll have will be four possessions in this game theyre down by 20 points theyre gonna have to get touchdowns, and their defense is gonna have to stand up and stop the saints offensively, and they cant take their time theyre gonna have to do it in chunks like that &gt;&gt; 42 minutes played <person player="michael vick" race="nonwhite" position="QB">michael vick</person> has six completions the falcons that was just their sixth first down only one by the run <person player="warrick dunn" race="nonwhite" position="RB">dunn</person> trying to make <person player="mark simoneau" race="white" position="LB">mark simoneau</person> miss, but the man who was acquired from the eagles in that trade we mentioned with donté stallworth brings him down after a short gain &gt;&gt; we talked about <person player="marques colston" race="nonwhite" position="WR">marques colston</person>, the wide receiver of the saints it was because of his play all through camp that donté stallworth became expendable, and the deal could be made to help probably the one area of this football team that needed the most defensively, the linebacker position &gt;&gt; yeah, remember the preseason? they told us that s the weakest position on this team, the position that concerned sean payton the most <person player="michael vick" race="nonwhite" position="QB">vick</person> across the 30 to the 31 joe, you mentioned a few times that the field was such an issue for the fans just joining us tonight, why is the field an issue for footing and speed of the falcons? &gt;&gt; it s brandnew grass, and the blades of the grass, be it artificial or not, are long and the rubber that is mixed in, you can see it flying up the field has not been matted down yet it s a slow track i liken it to a muddy football field under normal conditions, where you just cant get that really good footing &gt;&gt; third and 4 time for <person player="michael vick" race="nonwhite" position="QB">vick</person> the deep ball for <person player="ashley lelie" race="UNK" position="WR">ashley lelie</person> a lot of contact flag comes down <person player="ashley lelie" race="UNK" position="WR">lelie</person> and <person player="mike mckenzie" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mike mckenzie</person> got all locked up as they were sprinting down about 35 yards from where the play happened let s see who the call is going to be on when ed hochuli tells the coach "stay there" &gt;&gt; [ chuckles ] exactly you look at his arms &gt;&gt; there was no foul for pass interference on the play the pass is incomplete &gt;&gt; you decide &gt;&gt; if there was no foul, why was the flag thrown? did the official not see something? &gt;&gt; that s a very zenlike question, <person player="joe horn" race="UNK" position="WR">joe</person> i dont think were capable of answering it &gt;&gt; dont you think, after watching that replay, that that was the right outcome at the end of the day? &gt;&gt; you know, with pass interference, mike, you just dont know i mean, his body you dont know i mean, it could be, it couldnt be when the flag is thrown, he mustve seen something that caused him to take it out of his pants &gt;&gt; <person player="michael koenen" race="white" position="P">koenen</person> s punt will go out of bounds &gt;&gt; [ laughs ] &gt;&gt; the flag out of his pants [ laughter ] &gt;&gt; tony, sometimes it s like having a little kid you pretend that you didnt hear &gt;&gt; i want to qualify that, okay? &gt;&gt; an official has taken a flag out of somewhere on this play as well &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; [ laughs ] it s a nocommenter for me &gt;&gt; you started laughing, though, didnt you? &gt;&gt; yes, i did &gt;&gt; and youre still laughing &gt;&gt; yeah it s funny &gt;&gt; so, he s just asking the falcons if they want to tack it on to where the ball is and push new orleans back 10 "and while youre asking me that question, i want to know why you picked up the flag over there" jim mora taking that opportunity &gt;&gt; he should ask him what kind of discussion could they have had? &gt;&gt; holding by the receiving team, number 27, during the kick that 10yard penalty is enforced from the end of the kick first down &gt;&gt; something to keep in mind in the first two games for atlanta, against carolina and tampa, they scored 20 points in the first game, only 14 against the bucs so were not talking about an offense that s hit its stride yet, that can go out and just post numbers it s not like theyre scoring 35 and 35 theyre counting on their defense a lot and <person player="michael vick" race="nonwhite" position="QB">michael vick</person> and <person player="warrick dunn" race="nonwhite" position="RB">warrick dunn</person> s running ability &gt;&gt; wait didnt you think that the way they were running the ball as if they were operating out of an old single wing and plowing over people, didnt you think they had a certain invincible quality as they came into this game? didnt you think that? &gt;&gt; yes, i did &gt;&gt; okay &gt;&gt; and the saints decided that they werent invincible &gt;&gt; because of the size of the turf &gt;&gt; i think it s a factor [ whistle blows ] &gt;&gt; and a whistle brings proceedings to a halt here &gt;&gt; <person player="drew brees" race="white" position="QB">drew brees</person> would like to know what s going on ah, that s one of those secret meetings that you never find out about a secret meeting between the officials has just taken place let s go play football &gt;&gt; im totally in the "just get it right" camp you can conference all you want &gt;&gt; enough already &gt;&gt; just get it right and most times, although fans who care about the game of their rooting interest, dont believe it, they do get it right <person player="reggie bush" race="nonwhite" position="RB">reggie bush</person> gains almost 9 yards &gt;&gt; <person player="reggie bush" race="nonwhite" position="RB">reggie bush</person> is proving tonight that he is not just a space player when we say the term "space," get outside, get oneonone with the linebackers and the defensive backs he s proving he can run inside running an awful lot like <person player="warrick dunn" race="nonwhite" position="RB">warrick dunn</person> for a guy that s not real big &gt;&gt; and you pointed them out before, <person player="joe horn" race="UNK" position="WR">joe</person> an offensive line that really had a lot a lot of questions almost everybody was moved, somebody in a new position, and theyve done a very solid job tonight <person player="deuce mcallister" race="UNK" position="RB">mcallister</person> will be right at the firstdown mark as we bring the third quarter to a close sean payton trying to open 30 <person player="reggie bush" race="nonwhite" position="RB">reggie bush</person> and the saints have had one of those nights that you dream of in one of these situations pretty close to a nightmare for <person player="michael vick" race="nonwhite" position="QB">michael vick</person> thus far there is gonna be a measurement here, and that s why the clock is stopped with 4 seconds, to see if there s a first down before the quarter comes to an end so, new orleans will start first and 10 at its own 34 when the fourth frame begins <person player="drew brees" race="white" position="QB">drew brees</person> in his first home game as a new orleans saint, the saints in their first true home game in 23 games last year they were on the road all the time the saints return game here in the louisiana superdome it just struck me just look at that image and how the images of 13 months ago are so in your mind, and over time, will that image of the dome and of new orleans come back? and part of it will be if you see the saints a lot and maybe you will theyre knocking on the door of 30 to start the season, leading by 20, with the ball as the fourth quarter begins they wanted movement on the tight end <person player="mark campbell" race="UNK" position="TE">mark campbell</person> they say he stayed in his stance and <person player="deuce mcallister" race="UNK" position="RB">mcallister</person> runs close to a first down &gt;&gt; there s tom benson, the owner of the saints there are a lot of people who felt he wanted to move out of here even before what happened with katrina he certainly publicly last year said that he was unhappy with the entire state of louisiana had an incident at one of the games <person player="paul carrington" race="UNK" position="DE">paul</person> tagliabue made this happen here in one of the last acts as commissioner of the national football league he made sure that the new orleans saints were repatriated to new orleans it was so important to him for that to happen, that when the schedule was announced this year, <person player="paul carrington" race="UNK" position="DE">paul</person> tagliabue announced it outside the superdome "were gonna have home games at the superdome" and that franchise is here now there may be a lot of owners in the league who think it may eventually go to los angeles, but <person player="paul carrington" race="UNK" position="DE">paul</person> tagliabue made it clear it would come back, and i believe the league wants it here for as long as possible &gt;&gt; the saints current lease in the superdome runs through 2010 that s not a long time in terms of stadium leases <person player="drew brees" race="white" position="QB">brees</person> pumping, throwing the deep ball for <person player="joe horn" race="UNK" position="WR">joe horn</person> <person player="deangelo hall" race="nonwhite" position="DB">deangelo hall</person> had coverage <person player="deangelo hall" race="nonwhite" position="DB">hall</person> banged up in the first half has been on the field almost all the second half, and well have second down coming up as i mentioned, that lease runs till 2010 and sports in new orleans is a longterm questions with no longterm answer the short term is tulane s football team comes back in here they played in all different stadiums last year they play here on saturday across the walkway, the new orleans hornets of the nba will play a game a month here next year, and still a question, but intentions from their owner, george shinn, to play here in 07 and 08 &gt;&gt; you look at this crowd tonight, and this year is the first year that all the season tickets have been sold, ever, in the history of the franchise you look at this crowd tonight, and it would seem clear to most people looking from a distance that this franchise is alive and well in new orleans right now now, if it s something like basketball, where there are 41 home games, as opposed to only 8 home games for professional football, that s a different matter but certainly you get the impression that they could support 8 home games ill give you an example sean payton talked about this being at a concert this summer, and a guy comes up to him who does not have a job does not know where he s gonna live and says, "coach, i have bought six season tickets for the saints that s how much i believe in them that s how much i want to be a part of this" sean payton was stunned at that says that s been repeated three or four times since he s here people without places to live, people without jobs making a commitment to the saints because it is the lifeblood of the community &gt;&gt; third and 7, and <person player="drew brees" race="white" position="QB">brees</person> is finally brought down that s the first pressure of the night <person player="kevin mathis" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kevin mathis</person> bringing it off a safety blitz will force a new orleans punt &gt;&gt; that could be the play that the saints need to be able to get them started they have really muddled around in a funk all night no spark <person player="michael vick" race="nonwhite" position="QB">michael vick</person> has not been able to ignite them with his legs or his arm &gt;&gt; and in this half, joe, atlanta s only run seven plays for 29 yards <person player="steve weatherford" race="white" position="P">weatherford</person> to punt again 44yard kick <person player="allen rossum" race="nonwhite" position="DB">rossum</person> from the 12 he hops out of bounds at the 25 suzy standing by with the dallas mavericks head coach, avery johnson suzy &gt;&gt; well, one of the things that sean payton has done to try to develop this culture of winning is bring in guest speakers, and the thing they have in common theyve all won championships, and avery, of course, led the 99 spurs to a championship what was the numberone thing you wanted to express to this team about how to be a winner? &gt;&gt; well, i just talked to them from the theme of seize the second, of this season, and just take advantage of every opportunity and know that youre not just playing for yourselves, but youre playing for a whole city &gt;&gt; avery, hang on one second &gt;&gt; all right, suze, here s first down from the 26 and playaction with vick, who is flushed, dancing, darting and brought down good coverage <person player="scott shanle" race="white" position="LB">scott shanle</person> suzy? &gt;&gt; avery, so appropriate that youre here with the team where exactly did you grow up? &gt;&gt; i grew up about six blocks away from the superdome, and it s so meaningful for me to be here, representing my family, my wife s family, and it s just great to be here with all of the people from new orleans &gt;&gt; what were the days like for you after katrina? &gt;&gt; it was tough because i had some relatives that we couldnt contact, and it was rough staying up all night wondering where your family is, but everybody s doing well now &gt;&gt; that s great to hear great to see you &gt;&gt; thanks &gt;&gt; second down deep ball is incomplete <person player="michael jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="WR">michael jenkins</person>, at 64", tried to go up and get it, like avery s mavericks do, but welldefended by <person player="fred thomas" race="UNK" position="DB">fred thomas</person>, who was hurt earlier in the half &gt;&gt; every one of the defenders, whether theyre linebackers or defensive backs, have not given the receivers of the atlanta falcons room to breathe you have to find some margin of error <person player="michael jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="WR">michael jenkins</person> it wouldve been a difficult catch, but it s the kind of a catch you need to ignite an offense, and theyre running out of time &gt;&gt; look at those numbers two to one advantage, new orleans essentially in yards they roll <person player="michael vick" race="nonwhite" position="QB">vick</person> left he couldnt get his footing but finds a way to take off, and is sliding down shy of the 30 <person player="scott fujita" race="white" position="LB">scott fujita</person> and <person player="mike mckenzie" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mike mckenzie</person> force the punt &gt;&gt; it s difficult to get completions it s as much on the wide receivers not getting open as <person player="michael vick" race="nonwhite" position="QB">michael vick</person> &gt;&gt; another <person player="michael koenen" race="white" position="P">koenen</person> punt a returnable line drive 39 yards <person player="lance moore" race="white" position="WR">lance moore</person> from the 32 out of bounds this the 234th regularseason new orleans saints game here in the superdome that is more nfl regularseason games in this dome than any other in the national football league obviously domes have come online as time has come on, but this is the one that has set the standard over time <person player="deuce mcallister" race="UNK" position="RB">mcallister</person> <person player="deuce mcallister" race="UNK" position="RB">deuce</person> runs to the 46yard line he has 66 rushing yards tonight, <person player="joe horn" race="UNK" position="WR">joe</person> second and 7 <person player="drew brees" race="white" position="QB">brees</person> nobody open downfield scrambles back to make a positive play out of it you know, <person player="drew brees" race="white" position="QB">drew brees</person> is one of those guys who was always told, "you know, maybe there s a better thing elsewhere in the parking lot" too small, not fast enough your whole career sean payton said to us back in august, "ive seen plenty of big, fast, tall guys that cant play a lick of football but this guy, he s a winner" he won at westlake high school in austin, texas matter of fact, his junior year, his high school team was unbeaten he got hurt they didnt win the state championship came back undefeated state champs then he goes to purdue you know, that funky offense, a lot of basketball and short passes, he s not big enough only kentucky and purdue recruited him alltime leading passer in the big ten, rose bowl team, third in the heisman voting here, trying to keep a third down alive, and it s incomplete for colston, and theyll have to kick it away so, that s one of the reasons sean payton said to us, "you know, this nfl franchise, this is a billiondollar industry, and it s a billiondollar jet i feel really comfortable having that guy, 27 years old, <person player="drew brees" race="white" position="QB">drew brees</person>, having the key to the billiondollar jet," and he s guided to two and perhaps a third win here tonight &gt;&gt; paid him $60 million to fly the jet &gt;&gt; good pilot pay right now <person player="allen rossum" race="nonwhite" position="DB">rossum</person> fielding the punt at the 14 just a gain of a yard, and the special teams for new orleans, all night long <person player="michael vick" race="nonwhite" position="QB">vick</person> is flushed, throwing on the run too high and hot for <person player="roddy white" race="nonwhite" position="WR">roddy white</person> incomplete we talked about shreveport, and this is a new orleans story tonight, but katrina, as you know, was a story that affected the entire gulf the neighbors to mississippi, obviously all the way across the gulf region, the number of deaths, the estimated damage at $81 billion, and the evacuees and i know there are a lot of people watching tonight in houston and birmingham and atlanta and especially in baton rouge who used to live in new orleans, and this used to be a place where you came i know a lot of you are watching tonight with heavy hearts and a lot of happiness, too, as <person player="michael vick" race="nonwhite" position="QB">vick</person> gets out of a sack, keeps timeout alive, dumps it to <person player="alge crumpler" race="nonwhite" position="TE">alge crumpler</person>, who gets a first down to the 28yard line <person player="mike mckenzie" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mike mckenzie</person> with the tackle and, guys, as you toured new orleans here, these things speak so much they just look like signs, but there s a lot to them &gt;&gt; there are x s on many of the houses that have to be gutted still at the bottom of the x, sometimes the saddest number of all reveals the dead that were found in that home &gt;&gt; <person player="michael vick" race="nonwhite" position="QB">vick</person> throws it is dropped by <person player="michael jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="WR">michael jenkins</person> the atlanta receivers havent come up tonight &gt;&gt; each of the houses was marked with an x, and that signified that someone went there from an official agency and saw what had happened to that house mightve referred to a pet that would be found, and again, at the bottom of the x, though, that sad number, and i saw one with five at the bottom, and those things are still clearly marked, and until the houses are removed, you will see them as you saw in that pictures of katrina photo essay &gt;&gt; after the incompletion, second and 10 <person player="michael vick" race="nonwhite" position="QB">vick</person> airing it out for white uncatchable third down &gt;&gt; we look at the atlanta falcons struggles on the offensive side of the ball, and what about <person player="michael vick" race="nonwhite" position="QB">michael vick</person>? <person player="warrick dunn" race="nonwhite" position="RB">warrick dunn</person> we havent even called his name tonight i mean, numberwise, he s been nonexistent it s the new orleans saints defense never seen a defense stay this close to receivers and give them no place to throw the football cant imagine ever seeing one that everybody has put in their hip pocket &gt;&gt; <person player="michael vick" race="nonwhite" position="QB">vick</person> takes off, finally able to get a first down and more! the magic of <person player="michael vick" race="nonwhite" position="QB">michael vick</person> to the 42yard line first down &gt;&gt; he needs to do that a lot more dont know if time is going to allow him to do it the falcons need yards in chunks 20 yards, 15 yards get a score &gt;&gt; gain of 30 there, and theyre going nohuddle here now, down 20 there s the big toss it s too tall and incomplete with <person player="alge crumpler" race="nonwhite" position="TE">crumpler</person> the intended receiver &gt;&gt; <person player="alge crumpler" race="nonwhite" position="TE">alge crumpler</person> missed a lot of the otas, the offseason workout, and it gave <person player="michael vick" race="nonwhite" position="QB">michael vick</person> an opportunity to be able to get more comfortable with <person player="roddy white" race="nonwhite" position="WR">roddy white</person> and <person player="michael jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="WR">michael jenkins</person> what has made him uncomfortable this evening is the fact that those two wide receivers cannot get away from <person player="fred thomas" race="UNK" position="DB">fred thomas</person> and <person player="mike mckenzie" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mike mckenzie</person>, the two corners of the saints &gt;&gt; that s 8 for 25 total i mean, that s not ever gonna win, 8 for 25, unless you run for 300, and he hasnt done that &gt;&gt; which they have been doing run for 279 a game &gt;&gt; jim mora cant believe that a penalty wasnt called on hitting a defenseless receiver because there was no way <person player="alge crumpler" race="nonwhite" position="TE">crumpler</person> was gonna get that they get <person player="warrick dunn" race="nonwhite" position="RB">dunn</person> again for a loss <person player="brian young" race="white" position="DE">brian young</person> s had a very good game he and <person player="scott shanle" race="white" position="LB">scott shanle</person> combined for the tackle and, joe, you talked about <person player="warrick dunn" race="nonwhite" position="RB">warrick dunn</person> he was just so impressive with <person player="michael vick" race="nonwhite" position="QB">vick</person> as a rushing offense they set a franchise record against tampa their twogame total was the third best in the nfl all time and tonight, 97 rushing yards they ran for so many yards, even with all the games played yesterday, the falcons started the night with 100plus rushing yards from every other team in the league, and they hadnt played this game yet third and a dozen here s a blitz it s picked up incomplete intended for white that s <person player="fred thomas" race="UNK" position="DB">fred thomas</person> there again on coverage &gt;&gt; it doesnt even look like the wide receivers of the falcons are making the defensive backs work theyre right there <person player="fred thomas" race="UNK" position="DB">fred thomas</person> just looking at him <person player="roddy white" race="nonwhite" position="WR">roddy white</person> tries to come back boom right there the other thing about this game, mike, is the new orleans saints, over the last six years, have not been a very good home team theyre 1929 at home they play better on the road tonight, you get the feeling it s unbelievable &gt;&gt; going for it on fourth down hauled in by <person player="michael jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jenkins</person> for the first down at the 30yard line part of the ohio state championship team in 2002 here he is in his third year, which can be the breakthrough year for a wide receiver you have a thirdyear receiver, a secondyear receiver, and lelie, who is seen as a somewhat onedimensional receiver, a deep threat, although the falcons say he s been pretty good in the complete receiver game thus far <person player="alge crumpler" race="nonwhite" position="TE">crumpler</person> tackled gain of about a half yard &gt;&gt; you wonder why <person player="roman harper" race="nonwhite" position="DB">roman harper</person> is starting at safety for the new orleans saints because he s a numbertwo draft pick who can do things like that excellent in the open field, taking on a very big tight end has great quickness spent a lot of time on the field at alabama &gt;&gt; nohuddle, 5 dbs underneath, <person player="justin griffith" race="nonwhite" position="RB">justin griffith</person> meets <person player="scott fujita" race="white" position="LB">scott fujita</person> &gt;&gt; this is one of those drives, like the one last night that tom brady spent about 9 minutes being on, and atlanta is gonna run out of time even if they score, it s gonna take them 6 or 7 minutes to actually finally score a touchdown &gt;&gt; a day when they said close the businesses at 3:00 so the fans can enjoy the first saints game, regular season here, since the end of 04 third down <person player="michael vick" race="nonwhite" position="QB">vick</person> eludes one not the second <person player="charles grant" race="nonwhite" position="DE">charles grant</person> will get credit &gt;&gt; but again, it s <person player="brian young" race="white" position="DE">brian young</person>, number 66, has been able to come up the middle and be in <person player="michael vick" race="nonwhite" position="QB">michael vick</person> s face all day &gt;&gt; done a great job up front and a hold here on atlanta &gt;&gt; holding, offense, number 74 the penalty is declined brings up fourth down the foul wouldve been enforced from the previous spot, not the spot of the foul &gt;&gt; the offensive line trying to hold people out really, this offensive line isnt built to block 35, 40 times theyre built to be able to zoneblock, move people, get them moving they pride themselves on a small, athletic line when you drop anybody back, <person player="michael vick" race="nonwhite" position="QB">michael vick</person> behind them, the big guys start to push them &gt;&gt; fourth down again needs to get to the 20 to keep the drive alive hit as he throws adjustment by <person player="michael jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jenkins</person> didnt hold it down, but the flag came down &gt;&gt; that s got a chance of being offensive pass interference &gt;&gt; it is &gt;&gt; <person player="michael jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="WR">michael jenkins</person> just pushed himself to be open &gt;&gt; on <person player="jason craft" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jason craft</person> and remember, the pass was incomplete &gt;&gt; the pass was incomplete pass interference, offense, number 12 the penalty is declined first down &gt;&gt; this must be so frustrating to atlanta they come into a circumstance where it s the saints first home game in over a year, and they think and they feel that everyone is rooting against them, and it s probably true everyone probably is rooting against them and they can get nothing done, even though for the first two weeks they look like one of the best teams in the national football league, running over carolina, right? running over tampa bay they came in here they probably had to think, "okay, we take the crowd out of it, we run over new orleans" do you see it on the faces of all the players on the team, and theyre wondering, "what has happened to us in this building tonight?" &gt;&gt; a 13play drive gives them nothing the saints fans chant "who dat?" the cry that has been heard "who dat think gonna beat dem saints?" as the locals like to say &gt;&gt; i imagine what happens now if youre new orleans you try to run out the clock where would sean payton have learned that? he wouldve learned it from bill parcells, who was one of his mentors along the way and when he uses phrases like, "unbias yourself as to how we acquired the player" bill parcells always referred to people as players he never mentioned terrell <person player="john owens" race="nonwhite" position="TE">owens</person> name he just said "the player" each time and when you look at sean payton and you hear him talk in that clipped way parcells does, he even sounds like parcells the only thing he doesnt have yet at his age is the dripping sarcasm that parcells has with every comment he makes but he s the pup out of parcells for sure &gt;&gt; mcallister, as this goes inside the 5minute mark, to the 34 joe, youve been around sean payton a while you go back to his days when he was with the giants and the play calling there was such heat there after he was the playcalling genius jim fassel had to take over the play calling what kind of feel do you have for how sean is gonna do here longterm as the head coach? &gt;&gt; he s laid a foundation of excellence, just the way he evaluates his players it doesnt matter where you come from it doesnt matter where youre drafted, whether you have any tenure or not "if you play well, youre gonna play for me" i thought some of the quotes about "maybe not the most talented players, but im gonna have the best players that work together," that is the way he will approach it, and that will serve him well &gt;&gt; third down <person player="marques colston" race="nonwhite" position="WR">marques colston</person> will fit that mold to a t he gets the first down at the 45yard line &gt;&gt; you talked about bill parcells, tony &gt;&gt; yeah &gt;&gt; when mickey loomis, the gm of the saints, went out looking for coaches, one of the things that he considered was where sean payton had coached, and bill parcells was a big part of it as a matter of fact, john fox, the head coach of the carolina panthers, called mickey loomis unsolicited and suggested sean payton &gt;&gt; hadnt he also worked for parcells john fox? everybody seems to have worked for parcells at one time or another sean payton at the moment 30 you got to like that &gt;&gt; seven catches for colston, 97 yards for the rookie and <person player="deuce mcallister" race="UNK" position="RB">mcallister</person> takes us inside 3 1/2 minutes to the 47yard line suzy, what about the players sean payton s brought around? &gt;&gt; well, im gonna go back to tony s point about the influence of bill parcells, and a lot of the players were concerned he would be more like a parcells type of coach "my way or the highway" but, really, they say, he s been just the opposite he s given them the tools for success but then put the responsibility on them to make their own mark, put their own signature on the team they describe payton as very businesslike his speeches are quite matteroffact, but they build confidence, and they know, mike, that if they listen to him, they can win &gt;&gt; and they can trust him that s something else but they can trust him when he says it s gonna be a certain way, that s the way it s going to be &gt;&gt; <person player="deuce mcallister" race="UNK" position="RB">mcallister</person> runs here inside of 2:50 left you know, the new orleans saints have been a franchise of futility in so many ways for so many years they have lost on "monday night football" seven consecutive games, the longest streak that was going, but that will come to an end here tonight, and still the saints will have the lowest "monday night football" percentage at 615, which will be 715 think about this franchise as we know, it took them so long to just get a winning season, and this is their 40th year it took them until 1987, which happened to be, by the way, the year the pope said mass in the dome &gt;&gt; ah &gt;&gt; just for them to have a winning record and then going forward in this getting to 40 years now, theyve had one playoff win there was so much negativity around this franchise for so long, and look at when you have to go back to the last time they had a monday night win 13 years ago, really 13 1/2, with jim mora s dad, the alltime winningest saints coach, jim mora, on the saints sideline &gt;&gt; and they talked about this game being a game where they can find out where they are <person player="ernie conwell" race="white" position="TE">ernie conwell</person> said, "this game will give us a gauge of where we are" and over the next three weeks, they get the panthers, the bucs, and the eagles so they will be challenged as they go but you sense a degree of confidence coming into that &gt;&gt; <person player="deuce mcallister" race="UNK" position="RB">mcallister</person> twisted around there on that surgically repaired right knee, as theyre at the 45yard line, shy of the first down &gt;&gt; havent you been impressed with the unselfishness of <person player="deuce mcallister" race="UNK" position="RB">deuce mcallister</person>? the franchise goes out and drafts <person player="reggie bush" race="nonwhite" position="RB">reggie bush</person>, and <person player="deuce mcallister" race="UNK" position="RB">deuce mcallister</person> basically says, "im coming in lighter my knee is coming back" and he said if <person player="reggie bush" race="nonwhite" position="RB">reggie bush</person> was out there, he wouldve drafted him, and i think sean payton has found a very nice balance between the two &gt;&gt; there you see how those numbers balance out tonight &gt;&gt; i like when you suggested before that it was providential, that with the pope s visit they were able, at that point, to have their first winning season of all time &gt;&gt; well, it just kind of speaks to the history here, as fourth down comes and the falcons will receive the punt, the history of this building as well, that it s not just the football stadium so much has happened here in a variety of ways, and the nfl chiefly among them you think about it and people at home watching, you probably have a superdome memory that comes to mind right away for you fair catch, rossum, 19yard line falcons will take over somebody who i know who went to school at syracuse remembers being in this dome when keith smart hit the shot for indiana and then coming back 16 years later and carmelo anthony and gerry mcnamara led syracuse to a national championship in here there s so many sporting events think of the super bowls here, six of them <person player="michael vick" race="nonwhite" position="QB">vick</person> back on the field to dunn, to the 20yard line &gt;&gt; and that brings it full circle to some degree, that one of the reasons they have so many super bowls here is because the food is so good that everybody wants to come here, reminding people once again that new orleans is open for business right now &gt;&gt; you mean the media people dont complain, as they did in detroit, or some media people complained in jacksonville? &gt;&gt; i dont know who youre talking about &gt;&gt; i dont know who were talking about, yes &gt;&gt; waffle houses i dont know who youre talking about &gt;&gt; there s <person player="michael vick" race="nonwhite" position="QB">vick</person> scrambling for the first down as we arrive at the 2minute warning <person player="michael vick" race="nonwhite" position="QB">vick</person> sacked again, by <person player="will smith" race="UNK" position="DE">will smith</person> again five new orleans sacks on the night &gt;&gt; and theyre coming from the defensive linemen it s not like linebackers are blitzing and defensive backs are blitzing &gt;&gt; there s a line in the movie "on the waterfront" that applies to <person player="michael vick" race="nonwhite" position="QB">michael vick</person> tonight, and it s "it s not your night, kid it s not your night" &gt;&gt; very apropos wrapped up like a christmas package &gt;&gt; they have the cardinals and then a bye week, do the falcons <person player="joe horn" race="UNK" position="WR">joe</person> mentioned the saints go to carolina, then tampa bay comes in here the following theyre just gonna run it with <person player="justin griffith" race="nonwhite" position="RB">justin griffith</person>, who gets to the 34 &gt;&gt; i would venture to say, of the 11 guys that started on the defensive side of the ball, seven of them had a piece of <person player="michael vick" race="nonwhite" position="QB">michael vick</person> at some point tonight &gt;&gt; very strong martha and the vandellas reference by you, joe, very strong &gt;&gt; third and 6, and theyre just running to cut your losses here and get on out griffith, with the tackle fourth down coming up you know, guys, as this game wraps up here tonight, you think people are gonna enjoy, theyre gonna celebrate, theyll have a good time tomorrow morning is gonna come and all the problems that people have in new orleans are still gonna be here, but for tonight they were given a chance to step away and enjoy a moment in the dome that some never thought they would see again [ crowd cheering ] new orleans saints, 30 tom benson with the parasol, the owner out on the field as the joyous saints wrap up this night
