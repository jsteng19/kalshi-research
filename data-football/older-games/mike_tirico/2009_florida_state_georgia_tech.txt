============================================================

welcome back everyone to college football primetime on espn2 it s the 22nd meeting alltime between florida state and georgia tech mark jones along with bob davie bob because it s been a tumultuous week how important is the start of this game <person player="marcus wright" race="UNK" position="RB">marcus</person> you know it s always important to start fast in college football but for florida state tonight it is critical i mean you mentioned it s been a week of controversy of distractions if they dont get off to a good start i mean it could unravel on them and keep in mind theyve lost four of their last five home games here in this stadium there s a lot of unrest in this crowd so for the crowd sake they need to get off to a good start tonight im chief osceola throwing that spear down to symbol the beginning of the festivities remember you talk about good starts bob davie last week in their loss up at boston college bobby bounds team fell behind bigtime at halftime and it was a battle to get themselves back into the game after that it finally made it close but in the end losing to boston college thus their first two game losing streak to start the season ever in acc play theyve never lost three in a row in the acc to start the season mark also keep in mind over on that other sidelines paul johnson in georgia tech they run the triple option if you fall behind this offense early you may not get the football back if paul johnson can just run the football so a lot of reasons for florida state to take this opening possession right now and gain some confidence for everybody in this building im prior to the game coach bobby bowden assembled his team and he told them troops it s not about me it s about what you guys do out on the field tonight mark georgia tech has really struggled on kickoff coverage this year this is greed greed still on his feet and they say it s a loose ball down in the field georgia tech says the ball came loose <person player="greg reid" race="UNK" position="DB">greg</person> <person player="bert reed" race="UNK" position="WR">reed</person> brought the ball out near the 32 still no call from the official still no call theyre still wrestling for the football how big is this right here mark you can almost hear the gasp and the subsequent sigh of relief from the over 83,000 fans here under the lights at doak campbell stadium it s going to stay seminole football one more look at reid fumbling the ball or not fumbling yeah that came out clearly stripped out of there by cory earl s the defensive back you know break read last week fumbled a punt against boston college monk and got it back he did the same thing right there on that opening kickoff and that was critical and he got ripped to the ball it appeared as if georgia tech should have been given possession instead first and ten for quarterback<person player="christian ponder" race="white" position="QB">christian ponder</person>from his own 32 hands it off to thomas with a caping hole into yellow john in territory at the 42yard line<person player="jermaine thomas" race="UNK" position="RB">jermaine thomas</person>with a nice run in a first down while<person

eight yards mamas take a look at the impact players mark i think florida state s founder quarterback<person player="christian ponder" race="white" position="QB">christian ponder</person>really has played well this season i think he s a future nfl player we went with the wide receivers maybe we should go with the running backs after sidney s first two plays here but<person player="richard goodman" race="UNK" position="WR">richard goodman</person>missed last year he s their number one receiver burt <person player="bert reed" race="UNK" position="WR">reed</person> a former high school quarterback their fastest receiver threw a touchdown pass last week against boston college on the reverse pretty sweet and letting his teammates know about it to second down and three this is thomas again this time thomas stopped up might have gotten a yard on the play itll be third down about three to go as we take out the defensive starting line up to the top of your screen for georgia tech you know the good thing for florida state as you look at honor is that there was no pondering who the storing quarterback was going to be coming into the season that was a very assuring situation for head coach bobby bowden mark and that s why i said they have found their quarterback because it seems like forever there s been a quarterback controversy here the florida state and third down into <person

passes by <person player="christian ponder" race="white" position="QB">ponder</person> scrambling by <person player="christian ponder" race="white" position="QB">ponder</person> but it all goes back to consistently running the football which theyve done early in this game first down in ten from the 15yard line looked like a busted play <person player="christian ponder" race="white" position="QB">ponder</person> with nobody handed off to not a bad play though as <person player="christian ponder" race="white" position="QB">ponder</person> makes it inside the 10 to the 8 youre fertile honey got seven yards he might want to put that in the playbook but mark i dont think jimbo fisher scripted that one exactly right moll johnson s shaking his head too early brakes here have gone against the yellowjackets that bumble on the opening kickoff and right there<person player="christian ponder" race="white" position="QB">christian ponder</person>turns that thing into a six yard

on espn2 primetime mark jones along with bob davie florida state marching it down the field to score on the opening possession of the game thomas running it in from 6 yards out to make it six nothing and there s parofsky who was taken off the field a few moments ago during our commercial break as we await the extra point there s <person player="dustin hopkins" race="white" position="K">hopkins</person> with the extra point attempt mr feuless here but not that one through its stamina nothing mark bobby bob has had a lot of big plays and is what 34 years as a head coach this opening kickoff there maybe none bigger right now the way the momentum is going <person player="greg reid" race="UNK" position="DB">greg</person> <person player="bert reed" race="UNK" position="WR">reed</person> gets that football stripped out completely right there and it looks right there is where he has possession of that football cory ellis now by the time the officials get in there the only thing i can say is they theme that is simultaneous possession which the offense is awarded possession but then watch on this touchdown run oh for the top of dominant ries that was a great opening possession right there by<person player="jermaine thomas" race="UNK" position="RB">jermaine thomas</person>the running back from florida s they watch this effort right here talk about red zone struggles that cleans up your red zone percentages but we talked about starting fast this crowd has energized between starting fast and what could have been a catastrophe if youre bobby bowden florida state this is smith on the return for georgia tech found to seamen ran over the top of his own man and brought down at the 27 yard line and that s where<person player="josh nesbitt" race="UNK" position="QB">josh nesbitt</person>will take the reins of this offense he s a junior from greensboro georgia completing 51% of his passes has thrown just three touchdowns on the season against two interceptions generally speaking folks they dont throw it a lot but last week he had a career week passing the ball 266 yards he was 11 of 14 in their victory at mississippi state first down in 10 for the yellow jackets<person player="jonathan dwyer" race="UNK" position="RB">jonathan dwyer</person>in the backfield alone back has been going to pass on first down and nobody close to that one incomplete intended for<person player="anthony allen" race="UNK" position="RB">anthony allen</person>second down and ten coming up for georgia tech we talked about the start last week bobby bowden s crew fell behind boston college since 21 to 6 at halftime it was uphill from that point on although here tonight off to a very auspicious beginning florida states only scored three points in the first quarter in the to games theyve already had seven tonight so people s emotion is that this phone and tripleoption they get to the edge and that s people s with a first down for georgia tech as we take a look at the impact players for the yellow jacket well the triple option market all starts with the pullback and<person player="jonathan dwyer" race="UNK" position="RB">jonathan dwyer</person>is a big play threat every time he touches it you have to take the pullback away when you talk about the georgia tech passing game it s all about the merriest thomas he s big strong and fast number one in the ac and yards receiving per game and on defense derek morgan is a threat rushing that passer etiquette punt at the various thomas he is the passing okay there s <person player="josh nesbitt" race="UNK" position="QB">nesbitt</person> on the option <person player="jonathan dwyer" race="UNK" position="RB">dwyer</person> if they would go for the state great pursuit and dryer brought down by de polan watson that s going to be a loss on the play of for this secondary position in run support his offense the passing game they have to get up there and stick their nose and stop that run but<person player="jamie robinson" race="UNK" position="DB">jamie robinson</person>an excellent play turning that football second and 14 jonesing motion why hit pardon me that s <person player="josh nesbitt" race="UNK" position="QB">nesbitt</person> keeps it himself in a nice gain of almost seven yards on the play itll be third and three to go mark you will see that play a lot tonight the quarterback duck i call it it s really a quarterback i so we go and let this thing roll youre going to see reads it pulls it out of the fullback you have the lead blocker in there and that s about 225 pounds <person player="josh nesbitt" race="UNK" position="QB">nesbitt</person> carrying that football up in there it s really an isolation play with the quarterback carry 33 <person player="josh nesbitt" race="UNK" position="QB">nesbitt</person> tosses it and that s going to be stuffed at the line of scrimmage rowdy with a nice job that time by the seminoles <person player="markus white" race="UNK" position="DL">white</person> <person player="jacobbi mcdaniel" race="UNK" position="DL">mcdaniel</person> mcrae and mcneal upfront and<person player="patrick robinson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">patrick robinson</person>will run support from the corner look at these florida state statistics and it s shocking when you think of a mickey andrews coach d fancy the mark dont be shocked right now on fourth down with georgia tech up there in a position to go for and that is a trademark signature of these triple option teams the four of six on fourth down situations this year long ago esma keeps himself got the first down he picked up six on the boy and take these big splits i mean look right here if these splits mark and then they go ahead again with the quarterback duck again the iso up in there and that s just a big old quarterback we played airforce one time at notre dame and bowl morgan you remember that no air force ran that played 25 times on us it is a very difficult play to scheme against and of course of the night well be talking about the intricacies of this offense this time they pass open downfield complete peoples with a catch and it will be first in gold for georgia tech a 36 yard pickup on the pass play<person player="jamie robinson" race="UNK" position="DB">jamie robinson</person>number 20 the strong safety mark keep in mind we said twice tonight<person player="jamie robinson" race="UNK" position="DB">jamie robinson</person>up in run support all of a sudden now it s option pass and watch<person player="jamie robinson" race="UNK" position="DB">jamie robinson</person>in a trail position on embree people s that s what makes it so difficult run run love its past first and goal from the six <person player="josh nesbitt" race="UNK" position="QB">nesbitt</person> keeps himself flying forward close to the oneyard line itll be second down and goal to go<person player="josh nesbitt" race="UNK" position="QB">josh nesbitt</person>101 aries coming into this game the pullback <person player="jonathan dwyer" race="UNK" position="RB">dwyer</person> with only 65 so<person player="josh nesbitt" race="UNK" position="QB">josh nesbitt</person>will carry the football all night long if you dont take him away skåne up about five it will be second and goal from the one here both teams seemingly off to a pretty good start offensively <person player="josh nesbitt" race="UNK" position="QB">nesbitt</person> keeps it touchdown georgia tech so they encounter on their opening drive <person player="josh nesbitt" race="UNK" position="QB">nesbitt</person> with his fourth rushing touchdown to the season and the 11th of his career one point shy of tying his game up in the confidence of paul johnson this isnt just tonight this is forever of going for it on fourth down mark at midfield he has so much confidence schematically that he can make the third short yardage situations he doesnt consider that a gamble it along three to go on that fourth them extra point on its way bobbin gone theyre going to review this play we can ask if or review if perhaps <person player="josh nesbitt" race="UNK" position="QB">nesbitt</person> crossed the plane this is negate the fast start of florida state let s look at this first up remember there must be indisputable video evidence that s the standard to overturn the decision on the field i think he s an mark i dont think there s any question he s scored on that play he went low the falls in the end zone across the plain were here in the game because of like well there were fireworks for the entire week leading up to this game and lightning now in the area you know what mark we talked about how critical it would be for a fast start were gonna get to do it twice we might as well go back and talk about that fast start for florida state again because it s 77 and both teams are gonna go to the locker room there was severe weather bob in the area a <person player="jabaris little" race="UNK" position="TE">little</person> bit earlier this afternoon with a torrential downpour this game will be temporarily suspended more on the other side well be right back back under the lights in tallahassee florida ready to resume this football game between number 22 georgia tech an unranked florida state play was suspended seemingly ages ago back at 8:23 pm eastern time we are starting again once now at 9:40 pm eastern over an hour delay florida state on the kickoff return das s <person player="bert reed" race="UNK" position="WR">reed</person> who almost fumble the opening kickoff was fortunate enough to get it back this time brought down and the 21 yard line remember george state took its opening drive eight plays 67 yards using up just under four minutes on the clock to score that touchdown by<person player="jermaine thomas" race="UNK" position="RB">jermaine thomas</person>this was what it looked like to start the game mark cut ball clearly came out on the opening kickoff it looked like georgia tech had possession corey earl s but then before the officials could hunt angle them it looked like they routes ruled simultaneous ization force that keeps the ball and goes and scores first down in ten this is thomas in the backfield weaving his way between the tackles picked up three itll be second down and seven remember<person player="jermaine thomas" race="UNK" position="RB">jermaine thomas</person>last year had a career night up in atlanta against georgia tech nine rushes for a total of 130 yards and bobby was impressive on that opening drive very impressive mark you mentioned what he did last year i thought really ran hard that first series keep mine this is a florida state rush offense it ranks 89th in the country coming into this game seminoles have lost two games in a row off to their worst start a <person player="jabaris little" race="UNK" position="TE">little</person> over 23 years trying to get off the schneid tonight second and seven <person player="christian ponder" race="white" position="QB">ponder</person> fires complete that s hurt read one of the team s most productive wide receivers with a first down out to the 39 yard line he picked up in deep yeah bergeron he s got 16 passes in the last two weeks i think he s probably florida state s fastest wide receiver and<person player="christian ponder" race="white" position="QB">christian ponder</person>continues mark he s been on fire the last three weeks of the season in another career week last week in the loss against boston college going for 341 yards first down in ten for florida state play fake by <person player="christian ponder" race="white" position="QB">ponder</person> plenty of time and wide open at the 40yard line it s park taehwan <person player="taiwan easterling" race="UNK" position="WR">easterling</person> with another first down to the seminoles and their biggest pickup of the night so far consisting of 33 ours or you have to have great protection to throw this route watch the pass protection i mean that s a tremendous window for him to throw the football<person player="taiwan easterling" race="UNK" position="WR">taiwan easterling</person>on the crossing route but that playaction pass takes a lot of time to develop right theyve got him behind a linebacker<person player="brad jefferson" race="UNK" position="LB">brad jefferson</person>1st and 10 from the 28 under hands it off to thomas and thomas straight ahead got about four yards of six one 190 pound sophomore averaging seven yards of carry coming into this game amazing thing florida state s not having had a thousandyard russia in 13 years the last guy that did it warwick done but you know they did rush for 313 yards against byu to come back and run 419 again in south florida it s a very inconsistent offensive team team to figure out sometimes <person player="christian ponder" race="white" position="QB">ponder</person> his number is pretty impeccable that passed a <person player="jabaris little" race="UNK" position="TE">little</person> bit high intended for <person player="beau reliford" race="UNK" position="TE">reliford</person> well mark sanchez at the new york jets head to miami where theyll face ronnie brown in the league s top ranked rushing offense jets dolphins on espn monday night football 8:30 pm eastern time coverage begins with monday night countdown served by applebee s 7 oclock eastern time remember the big argument with mark sanchez hadnt played enough football should shell out they do not come out mark sanchez youre not ready oops third down and six <person player="jabaris little" race="UNK" position="TE">little</person> movement up front some flags down pass complete to fortune and <person player="jarmon fortson" race="UNK" position="WR">fortson</person> fighting ahead for the first down but will displaced and nine that offensive land from florida state s still hanging in there i think it s going to be offsides and florida state really had a free play right there that was itll be against number 54 cedric <person player="sedric griffin" race="UNK" position="LB">griffin</person> okay well if youre just joining us this has been a week like no other for bobby bowden the 34 year head coach here at florida state university one of the members of the board of trustees calling for the end to the power bow an era at the end of this season and that was what said a lot of things in motion this week in tallahassee well talk about that throughout the course of the evening but so far the seminole team seems insulated from all that went on on the carry this was prior <person player="lonnie pryor" race="UNK" position="RB">lonnie</person> prior trying to get to the edge mountains wife the responding saying that they felt like coach mountain was betrayed by those comments some people perhaps disloyal to him and then coach bowden himself speaking a <person player="jabaris little" race="UNK" position="TE">little</person> bit later saying that he will evaluate himself at the end of the season meanwhile head coaching waiting jimbo fisher has the team s offensive coordinator second down and seven coming up under hands it off to thomas who falls forward for about a yard in the play and bob earlier during the day charlie chris none other than the governor of the state of florida says as a loyal knoll i want to wish florida state and the best of luck in tallahassee i wish all the best to coach bowden one of the greatest coaches of all time god bless you coach end quote so the coaching situation running all the way from the football field to the top of the state government and perhaps beyond ninth play of the drive coming up under at im wide open touchdown wellford though <person player="beau reliford" race="UNK" position="TE">reliford</person> with his first career touchdown our georgia tech on an allout blitz straight mantoman coverage they turn to titan bo releford completely loose that was a broken coverage way way too easy right there for florida state well you talk about a great way to come out of the locker room bob davie after an hour and 20 minute rain delay or suspension because of lightning whatever you want to call it florida state jimbo fisher s offense hitting on all cylinders right now well be right back after this espn s college football primetime grouchy boy michelin a better way forward and cheese it you the wheel when you see it you might be a <person player="jabaris little" race="UNK" position="TE">little</person> bit premature but bob davie this has already been a very memorable night both on and off the field for football and for non football reasons what s happened down in the grid and then what s happened weatherwise lord of state leading 14 to 7 still in the first quarter well the second start to this game looks just like the first start to this game florida state takes it right down the field im plays almost 80 yards using up four minutes on the clock this is smith on the return and smith with a nice return out near the 40 yard line for georgia tech well the yellow jalen jackets and tyrone <person player="josh nesbitt" race="UNK" position="QB">nesbitt</person> were pardon me<person player="josh nesbitt" race="UNK" position="QB">josh nesbitt</person>were able to respond the first time by taking it right back at florida state s defense and scoring one more look though but what was the key on this touchdown well georgia tech comes with an allout blitz there in straight mantoman coverage and theyre going to turn the tight end completely loose in coverage<person player="beau reliford" race="UNK" position="TE">beau reliford</person>and he is just wide open it as a total coverage bust first down in 10 has been on the toss that s allan<person player="anthony allen" race="UNK" position="RB">anthony allen</person>has an alley and could go<person player="anthony allen" race="UNK" position="RB">anthony allen</person>with a burst down the sidelines pushed out of bounds first and goal for georgia tech he s out of bounds just shy of that pylon man the turbo kicked in wow the transfer from louisville they come out on the simple triple option and i mean there is nobody nobody in run support excellent effort downfield by<person player="jamie robinson" race="UNK" position="DB">jamie robinson</person>saving that touchdown <person player="ben anderson" race="UNK" position="DL">ben</person> mark there was nobody in one support for the seminoles you think they had a lot of time to go over their assignments during that break <person player="josh nesbitt" race="UNK" position="QB">nesbitt</person> keeps it exports in two plays a resounding response a definitive response by the yellowjackets to come back to within one point a florida state how is that for a counterpoint what if youre mickey andrews on that sideline you are reeling right now as the defensive port head that has got to be disheartening for the seminoles and their fans as the look on their faces collectively says extra point good and were tied at 14 apiece boy at this pace were looking at 56 all and last team with the ball wins right pocket no mark and let me say this you know having coached against that triple option so much probably the worst week of the ear just schedulewise for florida state to have the distractions and the controversy they had particularly on that florida state defense because you have to be focused from the first meeting the first day you meet to get ready for this wishbone you cannot have a distraction it is all about preparation it s interesting bob you talk about how special the option is and how it s evolved over the years and still an important part of college football well yeah i mean you look back at the texas wishbone the only difference the three backs lined up completely in the backfield but it is for all intents exactly the same all you see here are the slots lined up for georgia tech up on the line of scrimmage but it s actually the true wishbone putting those running backs up on the line of scrimmage make them more of an immediate threat particularly in the passing games are why does paul johnson call it the spread option if it s wish morna who who do i believe im a <person player="jabaris little" race="UNK" position="TE">little</person> confused on this well he s trying to make it a <person player="jabaris little" race="UNK" position="TE">little</person> bit sexier okay but it is the wishbone it is the triple option okay from the three yard line this is <person player="greg reid" race="UNK" position="DB">greg</person> <person player="bert reed" race="UNK" position="WR">reed</person> and <person player="bert reed" race="UNK" position="WR">reed</person> stopped up short of the 15 yard line itll be first down in ten as we get into breather on the sidelines that was his second rushing touchdown tonight that ties his careerhigh and we got a lot of football to go folks 201 to go here in the first quarter and people ask all the time why is florida state s so inconsistent as a team how can they go beat byu and then come back and lose the usf it s because their defense is not nearly what it used to be and they give up big plans that may be the single biggest reason they are such an inconsistent football team mark theyve had some guys <person player="nick moody" race="UNK" position="DB">nick</person> duncan lead back into that defense to had some changes in the secondary first down in ten<person player="christian ponder" race="white" position="QB">christian ponder</person>has led them on two scoring drives already tonight and thomas out over the 15 to the 17 yard line picked up five on the play and thomas admittedly saying that although he had a pretty productive freshman season for over 500 yards he says that it s gotta slow down a <person player="jabaris little" race="UNK" position="TE">little</person> bit still let the game come to him see things a <person player="jabaris little" race="UNK" position="TE">little</person> bit better but it s been pretty productive so far this year he has a lot of talent our plate last year is a true freshman had a <person player="jabaris little" race="UNK" position="TE">little</person> bit of a sophomore slump going this year you take a look at mickey over there it s gonna be a long night a long night of adjustments for mickey andrews <person player="christian ponder" race="white" position="QB">ponder</person> passing incomplete on the quick slant for number eight<person player="taiwan easterling" race="UNK" position="WR">taiwan easterling</person>will be second down and ten marquis sense a <person player="jabaris little" race="UNK" position="TE">little</person> bit of the air coming out of the balloon right now in this stadium and that s what happens when you give up those make home run plays it just deflates everybody not just the players but all these people in these stands right now they fought back last week against boston college and then allowed montel <person player="maurice harris" race="UNK" position="LB">harris</person> the bc running back to rip them for over 40 something arts which led to the game when he scored i got another free play <person player="christian ponder" race="white" position="QB">ponder</person> downfield and overthrows <person player="taiwan easterling" race="UNK" position="WR">easterling</person> it had appeared to be offsides by georgia tech look at florida state s offensive line mark watch them theyre coached by a rick trickett after they get georgia tech to jump offsides you see right now the linebacker 54 coming up in there again cedric <person player="sedric griffin" race="UNK" position="LB">griffin</person> but look at florida state s offensive line hold in there there to take any doubt away from those officials okay that they moved they did not flinch i never saw one wait that long that s some good discipline by ready to discipline old marine rick tricky coach trickett says come to my office you you loosen your collar a <person player="jabaris little" race="UNK" position="TE">little</person> bit and start sweating got to who s sweating man this georgia tech defense you know that last week against mississippi state mississippi state had almost 500 yards didnt punt in the football game right now the way this thing s gone it doesnt look like florida state s comp on 151 yards already in his football game were still in the first quarter in game 4 georgia tech they come in here for and won overall 2 &amp; 1 in conference play their one loss against the miami hurricanes down in miami so paul johnson their head coach telling us before the game that hey we cant entertain any thoughts of winning the conference championship if we go down two games in conference play with a loss tonight throwdown in one coming up thomas in the backfield <person player="rod owens" race="UNK" position="WR">owens</person> in motion we talked about the athletic prowess of <person player="christian ponder" race="white" position="QB">ponder</person> and he keeps it himself getting the first down for the seminoles talked about the acc standings shaping up a <person player="jabaris little" race="UNK" position="TE">little</person> bit here indeed second weekend in october georgia tech two and one overall even though they wants to miami they still control their own destiny to a degree tonight here obviously in tallahassee next week in atlanta against virginia tech but if they lose another acc game that race is over heart and how how improved how impressive was virginia tech to <person player="christian ponder" race="white" position="QB">ponder</person> incomplete at the 35 yard line <person player="mister alexander" race="UNK" position="LB">mister</person> <person player="christian ponder" race="white" position="QB">ponder</person> started all 13 games of season ago and entered the season knowing that he was going to be the number one quarterback that really helped ease a lot of the concerns of jimbo fisher the offensive coordinator / head coach in waiting designate the ponders thrown one interception and has the last 166 attempts second intent three execution first down seminoles at the 42<person player="jermaine thomas" race="UNK" position="RB">jermaine thomas</person>picking up 19 excellent play call right there by jimbo fisher on second and 10 set up the <person player="jabaris little" race="UNK" position="TE">little</person> screen this thing is wellexecuted mark look there s

is a simple dive to the fullback he just breaks outside and takes it to the house that s two huge plays touchdowns in the last two plays for georgia tech unbelievable till there with his fourth rushing touchdown of the season the twentyfifth of his career paul johnson feeling pretty good about last year s acc player of the year please put the tm defense they leave the back to go to oregon tonight this has to go back out there again though it s a coordinator this is the type of night that breaks you out in a sweat not because it s real humid in 85 degrees either six possessions in this game six touchdowns both eames three and three for the state gives up a sixty and a 69 yard run on two of the last three plays in his incredible offensive fireworks by both teams this is<person player="taiwan easterling" race="UNK" position="WR">taiwan easterling</person>on the kickoff return flag down in the field and <person player="taiwan easterling" race="UNK" position="WR">easterling</person> brought down at the 18 yard line just few moments there he is again mickey andrews the longtime defensive coordinator who has said that he will be done at the end of the season at florida state he said it that you know were not as physical as we need to be we have all the speed that we need but certainly wouldnt be happy with the way that theyre performing right now well one thing once speed goes in the wrong direction that can be a bad thing in this florida state defense mark were going to kick that over but florida state s defense last week against boston college gave up seven plays over 28 20 yards in that game now tonight it s just unraveled on them so when you have fast guys that run the wrong way fast that s even worse than slow guys if theyre running the wrong way slow and here s these last two plays here s a 60 yard pitch to<person player="anthony allen" race="UNK" position="RB">anthony allen</person>there is nobody in run support that is a schematically bad defense this right here there s nothing wrong with the scheme this is<person player="jonathan dwyer" race="UNK" position="RB">jonathan dwyer</person>just breaking the football outside but that s 129 yards rushing into plays and not to take anything away from<person player="jonathan dwyer" race="UNK" position="RB">jonathan dwyer</person>bob he moved pretty quickly down the field a big fella at over 230 pounds six feet he outran a few people down it hell be an nfl play he s in every down kind of back who happens to be playing in the triple option and fullback nothing completing the hook to complain about with the wishbone when youre racking up points like this exactly right youre exactly right it s so much for ball control wishbone this is a big play homerun wishbone here s the recap from the four <person player="taiwan easterling" race="UNK" position="WR">easterling</person> again and a sterling brought down at the 23 yard line let s go back to wendy in the studio mark thank you a reminder of what s going on around our family of networks on espn texas is now taking control 3114 over colorado and on abc iowa over michigan 22 14 about 11 minutes to go in the third quarter all right wendy back here can be first down in ten for the seminoles from their own 23 yard line since coming out of their own locker after the lightning delay theyve scored twice and in the pistil offense right here different kind of look and this is thomas nice game close to that first down marker races fast paces tony <person player="kendrick stewart" race="UNK" position="DL">stewart</person> reemerged as a contender following his win last week in kansas can mark <person player="martin frierson" race="UNK" position="DB">martin</person> or jimmie johnson answer back as the chase heads west the chase for the nascar sprint cup continuing with pepsi 500 at california sunday at 12 pardon me 2:30 eastern on abc leftknee our pickup and another first down for florida state under working out of that shotgun and hands it off again thomas again with a decent gain over the left side tell us about you use the term pistol explain well the quarterbacks in the shotgun but the tailback right behind a quarterback deeper you know the quarterbacks a <person player="jabaris little" race="UNK" position="TE">little</person> bit tighter than a normally is in the shotgun so it s kind of a combination shotgun and i in formation but ill say is the good news for florida state right now they can run the football a <person player="jabaris little" race="UNK" position="TE">little</person> bit and just try to calm their football town team down and forgiving up those big plays mark and im really impressed right now with your main thomas he looks fast certainly does doing a nice job so far tonight second and seven pick three step drop padded up this is up for grabs and caught by the seminoles<person player="jarmon fortson" race="UNK" position="WR">jarmon fortson</person>came down with it used all of his six point three inch frame to pick up six yards i think were going to see it all tonight mark jones i mean right there look at <person player="jarmon fortson" race="UNK" position="WR">jarmon</person> forced them a guy two coaches just rave about talentwise they keep waiting for him and good pressure right there cedric <person player="sedric griffin" race="UNK" position="LB">griffin</person> coming on the blitz but this is going to be one of those nights it s going to be one of those nights that bounced off a two players <person player="jarmon fortson" race="UNK" position="WR">fortson</person> got his hands on and talked about his potential he actually waited patiently behind great car and <person player="preston lyons" race="UNK" position="RB">preston</person> parker for a couple years to finally get his shot six through sophomore and <person player="christian ponder" race="white" position="QB">ponder</person> keeps it himself and gets the first down for florida state if youre just joining us and youre thinking why is this game only the second quarter well let us explain it started with a lightning delay weve seen a lot of that throughout the course of the night not much lately both teams were sent to their respective lockers to sit down and cool their heels for 78 minutes and then brought back out on the field at 9:30 had a 10minute warmup and then we resumed the play at 9:40 eastern time then the fun really started <person player="christian ponder" race="white" position="QB">ponder</person> complete at midfield nice catch and run once again it s<person player="jarmon fortson" race="UNK" position="WR">jarmon fortson</person>and you see these defenses struggling mark now obviously for florida state it s hard to get ready for the triple option but also for georgia tech because they practice against the triple option every day for des state s offense has a <person player="jabaris little" race="UNK" position="TE">little</person> bit of an advantage so both these defenses i think struggling right now a lot has to do with their style of offenses if that makes sense to you you know georgia tech goes against that triple option every week and practice right now florida state s just dominating them the numbers continue to pile up 461 total yards of offense in this game and this is portrayed and burt reid is on the loose another first down pushed out of bounds by<person player="dominique reese" race="UNK" position="DB">dominique reese</person>number 26 but <person player="bert reed" race="UNK" position="WR">reed</person> picked up 27 on that scamper and in first any time you throw those wide receiver screens the other wide receiver has to block and big charming ports their mark you mentioned 235 pounds he s going to get a pretty good block out here in the perimeter look right there he gives bert read enough sidelines bert read is factored he is fast ten point five 100 meters speed a couple of years ago back in high school first down in ten <person player="jabaris little" race="UNK" position="TE">little</person> receiver screen again this is read on the other side of the field made a nice move and a flag down back at the 20yard line well see if this play stands or not he picked up six if it does this one s going to be against the seminoles dave wommack the defensive coordinator for georgia tech and mickey andrews trying to gather their respective troops well ill tell you this nobody is rooting more for the offense than mickey andrews right now because he does not want to go back out on that field on defense just yet so he s pulling for that florida state offense just keep that ball get ahead stay ahead in this game there s dakota watson he gave his teammates an impassioned speech on the sidelines during the break a few moments ago that was a huge penalty mark that was the first seminal penalty of the night <person player="christian ponder" race="white" position="QB">ponder</person> complete this is <person player="jarmon fortson" race="UNK" position="WR">fortson</person> again and <person player="jarmon fortson" race="UNK" position="WR">fortson</person> inside the 20yard line to the 19 let s check in with wendy back in the studio mark thank you very much again an update florida and lsu the number one team in the country still leading ten to three tim see boats still playing in this one 319 to go in the third quarter and baseball news the dodgers make it three and oh they sweep the cardinals to advance the nlcs do not forget following this game baseball tonight with a complete look at the highlights and what to expect in the next series all right wendy we got a lot of homerun hitters tonight on the field seeing some huge plays by both teams second down and six thomas brought down after a gain of loved one by morgan derek morgan the guy that jimbo fisher was concerned about upfront defensively he s a good player in mark georgia tech has scored so quickly on offense their defense has been on this field the entire game i mean that s 34 plays for florida state georgia tech s only run 12 i think paul johnson getting up in the grill a <person player="jabaris little" race="UNK" position="TE">little</person> bit right there but this georgia tech defense on a hot hot humid night ponders hit his last eight passes on third down right here paul johnson was pretty hot too third and five into the end zone catch by court soon make that nine for<person player="christian ponder" race="white" position="QB">christian ponder</person>fortson look at gregg well they tell us about<person player="jarmon fortson" race="UNK" position="WR">jarmon fortson</person>saying his talent level is unlimited it s just a simple oneonone on<person player="michael peterson" race="UNK" position="DB">michael peterson</person>the corner that s poor technique market how about this play right here he goes up gets the left foot down that s going to be reviewed look like he did get that foot down left one i thought he did <person player="jarmon fortson" race="UNK" position="WR">fortson</person> telling me a <person player="jabaris little" race="UNK" position="TE">little</person> bit earlier he felt like he let down jimbo fisher the rest of the team last year but with efforts like this hell turn the tide in his favorites take a look at foot is down and that is a touchdown he looked like he had possession of the ball clearly that is a beautiful and athletic play huh certainly is his second touchdown of the season look at the field judge it s not by <person player="greg reid" race="UNK" position="DB">greg</person> mechanika he didnt miss that call he was right there it stands coach bowden right there to get the good news too ill tell you this game was weight worth waiting for it sure was this is an offensive explosion here in tallahassee 317 yards for florida state mark used to be a defensive coordinator right 317 yards he came up for a game youd go home and lay awake all night bonder ties his careerhigh already with three passing touchdowns in the game with most of the games still to play <person player="jarmon fortson" race="UNK" position="WR">fortson</person> with a dynamic play and the defenses are running for cover right here in tallahassee hey that was a scene last night on south item street they called it the downtown get down facepainting bob davie indulging in some of his favorite foods right coach i did have all that barbecue and some kettle corn it is percolating and popping right now down to the field short kick at the 45 who recovered it a short kick it looks like georgia tech recovered it theyre going to have good field position let s go back to wendy in the studio jim was colorado who got on the board first facing texas where the longhorns have since responded like the number two team in the country that they are jordan shipley on the return here 75 yards hell take it all the way you know jordan shipley along with dj monroe to the most dangerous men in the country great for this texas team 3814 we have about two minutes to play all right wendy back here a <person player="jabaris little" race="UNK" position="TE">little</person> toss and<person player="anthony allen" race="UNK" position="RB">anthony allen</person>stopped after a gain of about two and what about that ansan capable park it was an onside kick watch florida state right now this shows how much respect you have for georgia tech s offense they come with the <person player="jabaris little" race="UNK" position="TE">little</person> middle squib onside kick georgia tech kevin kony wide receiver excellent job recovering but that s about how much they are impressed and really dont think they can stop this georgia tech offense i mean if you have to onside kick in this situation this early let s make it a pretty big statement wow second and three <person player="josh nesbitt" race="UNK" position="QB">nesbitt</person> antonov to<person player="jonathan dwyer" race="UNK" position="RB">jonathan dwyer</person>who had a 69 yard touchdown run on their last series well it wasnt originally really a series it was one play this has been a night of big plays and bob at what point does the time of possession become a factor when you look at how long each team is at the ball markets the opposite because georgia tech you see these big plays on the season but anytime you have those big explosive place like they detonate your defense goes right back out there third down in one coming up first down <person player="josh nesbitt" race="UNK" position="QB">nesbitt</person> picked up three keep wondering at what point will one of these defenses come up and get a stop course stops a fourletter word tonight well mark this is going to be kind of game were truly a turnover besides the game because both these offenses are on such good rhythm the defense s cant stop them itll be about who can create a turnover people s emotion has been on the toss into the wide side of the field <person player="jonathan dwyer" race="UNK" position="RB">dwyer</person> could not get away good pursuit by dakota watson and now a late flag it s going to be a late hit yeah mark were going to get a late hit out of bounds right there by <person player="greg reid" race="UNK" position="DB">greg</person> <person player="bert reed" race="UNK" position="WR">reed</person> number five the freshman i thought it was number five i may have missed that he came in a <person player="jabaris little" race="UNK" position="TE">little</person> bit late let s go back and take a look over here on the sidelines close to being a horse collar right there yeah that s gregory i mean he was a good three yards out of bounds that old saying the great thing about freshmen like gregory eventually become sophomores right true that fumble dad opening kick up and i think gregory is a talent out of valdosta georgia reminds me a <person player="jabaris little" race="UNK" position="TE">little</person> bit about terrell reminds me of terrell buckley on former florida state corner of that kind of ability one of the coaches now on their staff first down in ten as but keeps it himself about that they held him up for just a three art game that s a huge win on a night like tonight six minutes to go in the first half florida state leading by seven trying to snap out of their two game losing streak during the text verse three driving ill tell you what take that and divide it divide 12 into those total numbers of yardies and figure out what the ns look like it s a bunch of yards per play right there in those first turns out second down and seven as good keeps it down at the 7yard line boy when you play quarterback in that wishbone after the gain of five how important is footwork in ball handling if that s what it all is mark i mean it s difficult to sit here in cu has the football at times it s really difficult down there on the football field and you take a guy like <person player="josh nesbitt" race="UNK" position="QB">nesbitt</person> he carried the ball 32 times against north carolina 23 times last week against mississippi state this is four down territory right here for georgia tech and this is where hell carry the football again 32 on the toss big hit on number 24 emery people s but he picked up five and it looks like another first down first and goal for georgia tech im mark jones along with bob davie under the lights in tallahassee here s what s happening now huge offensive night for both teams over 500 almost 550 total yards of offense coming up in just a bit davy jones locker will get you an update on one of the road scholars here formerly at florida state and bobby bowden and some ceo stats and how they measure up respectable first and goal for georgia tech dwyre touchdown it all started with the onside kick but the way it s going right now it didnt matter a florida state would have kicked it off georgia tech would have taken that football down the field been a long time since weve seen a florida state defense this porous this malleable and bendable and both these teams tonight defensively struggling tied at 28 i asked you bob is it is a great offensive execution poor defensive execution a <person player="jabaris little" race="UNK" position="TE">little</person> bit of both okay i know this it s fuzzy defenses are struggling your kind that is about as kind as you can categorize these defenses and look last year<person player="jonathan dwyer" race="UNK" position="RB">jonathan dwyer</person>against florida stay to me keep in mind this guy had 1390 the player of the year in the acc here he takes a <person player="jabaris little" race="UNK" position="TE">little</person> she s supposed to go up inside breaks it outside this is an explosive tale man playing fullback in this offense and mark he will be an nfl player he was a parade allamerican out of high school 5a player of the year in georgia<person player="jonathan dwyer" race="UNK" position="RB">jonathan dwyer</person>following up on a great season says that he improved his leadership skills during the offseason in his pass blocking getting ready bob as you mentioned for the next level interestingly enough he was recruited by paul johnson one his head coach was at navy of course coach johnson telling us that didnt quite work out for him but in the big picture ultimately it did he said he would he wasnt real high on wearing that uniform in parching south paul johnson said to recruiting went for half navy with<person player="jonathan dwyer" race="UNK" position="RB">jonathan dwyer</person>but mark you have to ask this question and i know the answer why dont more people run this triple option in major college football and ill tell you exactly the reason and it s not very smart get to that after this easterland two yards deep back there with gregory this is <person player="bert reed" race="UNK" position="WR">reed</person> <person player="bert reed" race="UNK" position="WR">reed</person> with a great burst out to the 29 yard line let s go back to wendy in the studio park thank you very much coming up on the outback steakhouse halftime report since tebow was a gametime decision but he does get the start well have an update sam bradford returned as well and it s saturday night so time for our saturday spotlight delivered by todd mcshea and <person player="robert hall" race="UNK" position="DL">robert</person> smith all right wendy and<person player="christian ponder" race="white" position="QB">christian ponder</person>back on the field for the seminoles first down in 10 rolls out in wide open the first down to<person player="jarmon fortson" race="UNK" position="WR">jarmon fortson</person>who had a touchdown the last time he touched the ball from florida state meanwhile the last four drives for florida state very prolific very productive eight plays nine plays eight plays ten plays all touchdowns so jimbo fisher s offense clicking on all cylinders tonight theyve only had one game in which they were held to below 400 yards of offense so far on the season and <person player="christian ponder" race="white" position="QB">ponder</person> s at his last 10 passes in a row pass complete make that 11 in a row <person player="jarmon fortson" race="UNK" position="WR">fortson</person> this time on the other side of the field for this florida state offense they have found a quarterback to take a look at jimbo fisher i promise you people right here in this dating tonight feel pretty good about their head coaching lady because this offense has put on a show and you know it all starts with the quarterback mark you mentioned i mean theyve been in kind of a quarterback controversy quandary here at florida state it seems like for the last ten years well this guy has emerged<person player="christian ponder" race="white" position="QB">christian ponder</person>he still has another year he s just a junior first and ten he s completed his last 12 good block on the edge <person player="taiwan easterling" race="UNK" position="WR">easterling</person> and another seminal first down burstyn <person player="christian ponder" race="white" position="QB">ponder</person> pressing all the right buttons right now and pulling all the right strings good block by <person player="jarmon fortson" race="UNK" position="WR">fortson</person> mark that was really for defense that time by georgia tech i mean you have to keep that football and force it back to your health watch the corner right there run inside he stepped out of bounds and look i think that s going to be reviewed i thought he stepped out of bounds early there but that was poor defense again by georgia tech because no one out there right there that left foots on the line at the weight yard line would that be right to telford that vantage yard line wonder if theyre going to review this of course all plays up for review but there s a look at dave wommack the defensive coordinator for georgia tech excedrin headache number 43 perhaps neither way it s a first and tenant back to<person player="taiwan easterling" race="UNK" position="WR">taiwan easterling</person>who s having one of his more productive nights tonight number eight there he is a great allaround athlete he was selected by the florida marlins and the sixth round of the major league draft a couple of years ago coming out of high school he s caught three passes tonight for a total of 77 yards first down in ted eventually they have to review that dont they oh they both all start paul starr a bae offense that s the five yard mark they have made a change at corner georgia tech after that last play they took gerard <person player="jerrard tarrant" race="UNK" position="DB">tarrant</person> number 37 out of the game and number 10<person player="martin frierson" race="UNK" position="DB">martin frierson</person>is now in it corner lined up on burt <person player="bert reed" race="UNK" position="WR">reed</person> he s saying that he got fired well he got fired after that last plane you better watch burt <person player="bert reed" race="UNK" position="WR">reed</person> now testing out this new corner in the game <person player="martin frierson" race="UNK" position="DB">martin</person> fruit at <person player="martin frierson" race="UNK" position="DB">frierson</person> iverson thomas on the handoff hits the edge and hits it hard stepping on the gas thomas no doubting thomas touchdown and there s a flag on the play if it stands it s a 38 yard run for number 38<person player="jermaine thomas" race="UNK" position="RB">jermaine thomas</person>but will it stand it s going to go against the seminole so theyll take it off the board holder s against <person player="taiwan easterling" race="UNK" position="WR">taiwan</person> easterly mark theyve brought in<person player="martin frierson" race="UNK" position="DB">martin frierson</person>number ten in the corner watch right here now wow he got blocked we mentioned that <person player="martin frierson" race="UNK" position="DB">frierson</person> was in there for jared taran for our terran i mean the penalty is the only thing it s going to slow this offense down right now the georgia tech really really struggling in this football game are defensively there we go this is prior prior so on his feet good hand walked down to the 10yard line picked up six yards on to play ronnie <person player="lonnie pryor" race="UNK" position="RB">pryor</person> the six foot 1 inch 195 pound freshman this georgia tech defense theyre gassed right now i mean you have to play defense with emotion theyve given up so many plays and been on the field so long 40 plays for 393 yards they are just hanging on right now dig down deep just try to hold floor to stay to a field goal i would call timeout right now from georgia tech seriously just to regroup a <person player="jabaris little" race="UNK" position="TE">little</person> bit second down and four thomas mann he is running authoritative lee tonight about a yard short of the first down he picked up three it will be third down and about one and a half to go for florida state but you talk about on the timeout maybe trying to ghuli offense off a <person player="jabaris little" race="UNK" position="TE">little</person> bit nice the shooter i just would regroup on defense energize my defense try to hold them to a for a field goal theyre almost ready to cave in right now a lot of hands on hips there for the yellow jacket defense on this a very emotional night for florida state trying to snap a twogame losing streak their hit coach beleaguered by his critics throughout the course of the week thomas whipped the first down itll be first and goal from about the 4 yard line for the seminoles with under a minute to go here in the first half a threeyard pickup mark and i the reason i would call timeout it s hot it s humid telling your defense talk to your defense if you hold them to a field goal right here not a touchdown that will probably be the difference in this football game at some point seriously a field goal right now is a major win if youre georgia tech i bump both teams with three timeouts remaining thomas broke a tackle down to the oneyard line plenty of times ago <person player="jerrard tarrant" race="UNK" position="DB">tarrant</person> who s back in the ball game bob after who seemingly fired for a couple plates made the stop down to the 1 florida state showing a lot of versatility offensively tonight led by <person player="christian ponder" race="white" position="QB">ponder</person> exactly mark they started out running the football but<person player="christian ponder" race="white" position="QB">christian ponder</person>now this roll right here to <person player="jarmon fortson" race="UNK" position="WR">fortson</person> that is a bigtime probing think about the balance theyve had the first drive of the first game before we went to the lightning break they came out and just ran the football down the field he s hit his last 12 passes<person player="christian ponder" race="white" position="QB">christian ponder</person>and he is really carving up that defense doing surgery on georgia tech 2nd and goal coming up as florida state called the timeout and dont forget coming up on monday night football mark sanchez speaking of productive quarterbacks in the new york jets head to miami where theyll face ronnie brown and leakes top ranked rushing offense jets dolphins espn monday night football 8:30 pm eastern time coverage begins with monday night countdown served by applebee s at 7 oclock eastern you know in fairness to this georgia tech defense they lost some really good players awful last year s team i mean<person player="derrick morgan" race="UNK" position="DL">derrick morgan</person>is the only defensive lineman back for this football team he could use some help right now in 2nd and goal got a nice surge up front and <person player="jerrard tarrant" race="UNK" position="DB">tarrant</person> who has victimized several plays ago number 37 for the yellowjackets the first one to get there and florida state calls its second timeout stopping the clock with 22 seconds to go in the half and you know florida state has moved it so easily tonight mark that we really havent seen their achilles heel which witches theyve struggled in the red zone you know the last two weeks nine times inside 220 missed two field goals ran out of downs twice fumbled this has been a major reason florida state has not won more football teams red zone offense bob they talk about bobby bowden and his crew saying that there s such a fine line between them at 2 and 3 and perhaps being you know 4 &amp; 1 &amp; 5 to know perhaps like you said they went to byu and provo utah won that game very impressively but then you know confounding and confusing their followers coming home and losing to south florida and one thing you notice right there you havent seen much of bobby bowden with that hits head on the things are going pretty good 44 plays for yards right now for florida state it s been a while since ive seen bobby talking on that head said about flake off and now georgia tech calls a timeout bobby bowden has been here 34 years has only had one losing season that was his first season at five and six and he had this to say about him being a ceo and delegating to his assistant coaches well let me ask you this have you ever heard of a ceo that went down shovel coal if you ever heard of a ceo that goes down and and does the work for the guys no they dont do that that s what it s all i had football coach is this im saying this for a minute he s just a stinking problem solver and theyre been quite few problems to solve and bobby brings up a good point though he is 79 years old going to be 80 in november but when you take the top 500 fortune 500 companies average out the age of the respective ceos the average age comes out to 56 bobby bowden says hey if were not two and three my ages in the fact that i was my man <person player="cord howard" race="UNK" position="OL">howard</person> solomon going they still out there somewhere how those dividends are watching this guy he just saw his age and his name pop up on that screen his wife just woke them up right there here s <person player="christian ponder" race="white" position="QB">ponder</person> on third and goal complete a flag down touch down below it stan thomas lit the catch but there was a <person player="jabaris little" race="UNK" position="TE">little</person> bit of contact i think that was derek morgan out there in coverage actually it was wasnt a flag bomb it was something off his shoe how about the matchup okay we have derek morgan running man demand to the flat yeah that s big derek out there im telling you this is close close now look like he s stretched that ball across there well take a look at that look like a<person player="derrick morgan" race="UNK" position="DL">derrick morgan</person>of blue attire from a shoe or something came flying out the back let s take a look now this is a critical call in this football game because offensively the way it s going youre gonna see<person player="derrick morgan" race="UNK" position="DL">derrick morgan</person>now i mean heart how does he get caught out there right over its gob is gonna come down through there s no indisputable evidence to overturn it looks like he got the ball across right there that s a or ta me mark i mean it depends where that left foot was obviously when he extended that football theyre not going to see much on those two replays right there to change their opinion<person player="jermaine thomas" race="UNK" position="RB">jermaine thomas</person>out of jacksonville florida this play under review the ruin over mail well what a night for this young man huh<person player="jermaine thomas" race="UNK" position="RB">jermaine thomas</person>but what a night for derek morgan and his georgia tech defense that s four hundred and three yards in the first half for florida state and the meter still running 35 to 28 on derp with his fourth touchdown pass of the night of career high and he s connected on his last 13 straight passes now keep in mind<person player="derrick morgan" race="UNK" position="DL">derrick morgan</person>i believe is right here were going to let this thing whine i want to take a good look where he is yeah he comes out of that fourpoint stance i mean that s a great read by<person player="christian ponder" race="white" position="QB">christian ponder</person>now he went right where he should have gone i mean a good effort a good effort out there by<person player="derrick morgan" race="UNK" position="DL">derrick morgan</person>you have to question why he s in straight mantoman coverage to be honest but again the read by<person player="christian ponder" race="white" position="QB">christian ponder</person>who graduated in what mark two and a half years or did from florida state got his undergrad in very quick time and graduated magna laude actually no bob when i graduate said thank you long but<person player="christian ponder" race="white" position="QB">christian ponder</person>has all the reasons smile he s having a lot more fun than that georgia tech defenses happen right now i promise you but he has put on a show in this first half 267 yards passing and the good news for florida state georgia tech only has 17 7 but they could invent some sort the second half sure this will continue in the second half mother 17 seconds to go here in a very electric very offensively inclined first half of play we havent even come close to apart i mean it hasnt even been a big master thought i mean the punter hasnt even warmed up tonight both teams touchdowns on every possession in this game right nine possessions and 9 touchdowns ronn drive kick down at the 19 yard line first down intent with 15 seconds to go you know florida state with 21 first downs in this game and 403 yards i mean you could sack the bats right now in offense and youve helped yourself statistically in college football right now if you never played the second half this has been a good night offensively for florida state as but back to pass in complete stopping the clock with 10 seconds to go<person player="demaryius thomas" race="nonwhite" position="WR">demaryius thomas</person>spokes he hasnt come close to the ball tonight bob but he is a very very talented receiver mark we as uniform look how sweet it is i mean he s baby calvin johnson they have 35 completions on the entire season georgia tech mark he has 24 of them leads the acc with 107 yards a catch look at big<person player="stephen hill" race="UNK" position="WR">stephen hill</person>number 5 right there at 65 he s the other receiver theyve been having a chance those uniforms are still really clean hell you mentioned his name he scored a touchdown last week on a reverse against mississippi state a very talented true freshener keep in mind that georgia tech is winless here at doak campbell stadium this place is a veritable graveyard for them and this was the last meeting here at doak campbell army last three it s the first of the last three peter warrick running in for touchdown in a highscoring game it s wayne t handing up for touchdown here florida state winning again that time by 11 points the good news for the yellow jackets is that the margins appear to be getting a <person player="jabaris little" race="UNK" position="TE">little</person> bit closer although another win that time by florida state that time the only one by one point so theyre old for six all time here at doak campbell and their first win it gets bound and came just last season esma to pass setting up the screen flyer theyre lucky ran out of bounds three seconds to go there s no taking in me right here in this game but paul johnson he has done an incredible job everywhere he s been with this office i go back to 1990 when i was at texas a&amp;m he was the offensive coordinator at hawaii that time he was doing it on another island mark running this offense and it looked the same yeah then he went the navy is the offensive coordinator georgia southern then back the navy is the master of this offense he said florida state is still loaded with great players with a lot of guys who can run and make plays very physical first in ten <person player="josh nesbitt" race="UNK" position="QB">nesbitt</person> airs it out downfield and it s incomplete harmlessly at the 20 yard line and that will put the first 30 minutes of football in the books and what a memorable indelible 30 minutes it has been it started with pyrotechnics and fireworks and we got a lot of points right now were going to go to the outback steakhouse halftime report wendy nixa youll be working late into the night tonight so happy like that pointed that out we will be but it s well worth it here and next with todd mcclay and <person player="robert hall" race="UNK" position="DL">robert</person> smith im wendy dixon we welcome you to the outback steakhouse halftime report so far so good for<person player="christian ponder" race="white" position="QB">christian ponder</person>his numbers in their first half 18 of 21 267 yards and counting four touchdowns todd why is he been so effective well i think he has confidence really i mean he he knows where his receivers are he s throwing the ball with good mechanics and he s also doing a nice job of using his feet he s avoiding the rush he s getting outside and he s creating when things arent open right away ive been very impressed with<person player="christian ponder" race="white" position="QB">christian ponder</person>and right now this georgia tech defense looks defeated both the georgia tech defense has certainly had some problems too and that s been helping<person player="christian ponder" race="white" position="QB">christian ponder</person>to a degree you know i had a chance to speak with paul johnson a couple of weeks ago and you know he said that they simplified things a <person player="jabaris little" race="UNK" position="TE">little</person> bit defensively they had been in the three three five scheme and they moved to a 43 scheme which was supposed to simplify things a <person player="jabaris little" race="UNK" position="TE">little</person> but it still seems like the secondary is getting out of place you can see this happen in the clemson game you can see it happen in the miami game clearly with the secondary that georgia tech has the lack of rush that they have except for<person player="derrick morgan" race="UNK" position="DL">derrick morgan</person>theyre going to struggle with their pass defense all year if you were joining us during our 78th minute give or take a few lighting delay who s counting you happen to see then marks a boss interview with embattled florida state head coach bobby bowden and you know that was impressive i think bobby was very candid and will let you take a listen now to this interview coach you guys didnt lose any momentum offensively after that long too late 35 points over 400 yards in the first half what was the difference i dont think anybody planted the first half neither one of us well if we cant solve their problem they score of tempe get the ball course we have to that s nice their time we got a kickoff to them and somehow weve got to go in there and figure out what theyre doing and stop defensively too many big plays out of the triple option what have you got what kind of adjustments can you make in the second half dont even take them to plays they do it in one play this huh they just were just gonna do it s kind of like we dont know who the tackle you know im saying and the thing stopping the triple option somebody s got to take the quarterback in a pitch and a fullback and somebody would turn in loose thanks coach rockin and rollin under the lights here in tallahassee welcome back to college football and espn primetime as the georgia tech yellow jackets take on the florida state seminoles in a high scoring game and now let s see who s winging it brought to you by pizza hut wingstreet look at<person player="christian ponder" race="white" position="QB">christian ponder</person>s numbers tonight rocket <person player="christian ponder" race="white" position="QB">ponder</person> will anyone ever stop him 18:21 four touchdowns a career high now mark he played about as well as you can possibly play in the first half let me georgia tech didnt make it real hard on to be honest but he has been on fire the last four weeks now of this season georgia tech is gonna get the football to start this second half that s gerard terran back deep he s second nationally in punt return pretty while standing in kickoff return yardage to mark we had no punts in the first half no fumbles no interceptions no kickoff return one s gonna come out to the 20yard line that s where<person player="josh nesbitt" race="UNK" position="QB">josh nesbitt</person>will take the reins of georgia tech offense arm jones bond adavi on the night that certainly has seen a lot of different elam the overriding headlines this is a mustwin game for both teams for different reasons no question i mean for bobby bowden sitting here at ou and two in the acc has lost four of their last five games in this stadium they have to win this football game tonight georgia tech still in the acc race this game virginia tech next week in atlanta so a lot riding on the outcome of this football game has been on the toss that s number 20<person player="roddy jones" race="UNK" position="RB">roddy jones</person>and jones brought down at about the 25 yard line here s a look at the program statistics florida state rolling up four hundred and three yards of total offense you know marking total plays you know florida straight with 45 plays georgia tech only with 23 plays obviously the time of possession this georgia tech defense at the end of the first half physically mentally worn down the florida state defense only mentally worn down they didnt play a lot but they gave up some fuze big second six people s in motion fumble and the seminole is habit so the game adds its first turnover ever neal recovering the loose ball anytime in a readoption kind of offense you put the football in that full bats belly he s not sure if he s going to get it or not and mark that look to me like it really was a case of that<person player="josh nesbitt" race="UNK" position="QB">josh nesbitt</person>looked like he wanted to pull that football out<person player="jonathan dwyer" race="UNK" position="RB">jonathan dwyer</person>wanted to hang on to it and<person player="kevin mcneil" race="UNK" position="DL">kevin mcneil</person>recovered and these fans realized man that guy is amped up they realize what a huge play that was because if you can get two possessions ahead of the wishbone it changes things dramatically especially as easily as both teams have been scoring this is thomas and now georgia tech s defense comes up with a play albeit to just one here made by centric griffon number 54th to starting linebacker leading the team in tackles not making many tonight though well and you know that conversation at halftime was all about pride on defense guys stepping up and making some big plays it was all about pride because both defenses mark got embarrassed in the first half and they are both better and better coached than they played in the first game it was a loss of three on the first program under in completed the 24 yard line it will be third down and 13 <person player="jarmon fortson" race="UNK" position="WR">fortson</person> the intended receiver was working against mariel buckman he had hid under his last 13 passes in a row until that incompletion curtain lawn coming up havent seen many of these such situations tonight as reid comes into the ballgame for florida state thomas comes out paul johnson head coach looking for his defense to come with a dare i say a stop fake clock winding down in florida state he s going to use a timeout here to start the third quarter well they dont want to break that streak and saw that graphic up on the top eight for eight on third downs mark that s pretty good while tony <person player="kendrick stewart" race="UNK" position="DL">stewart</person> reemerged as a contender following michelin last week in kansas can mark partner jimmy johnson answer back as the chase heads west the chase for the nascar sprint cup continues with the pepsi 500 at california sunday at 2:30 eastern time on abc and here s a look at your leaders a nascar sprint <person player="martin frierson" race="UNK" position="DB">martin</person> jimmie johnson 18 points back jp montoya and third weve done a lot of football games together dont think weve seen i know we havent seen a first half oh the way that first half way especially after more than an hour lightning yeah exactly like that boy coming into it the head coach himself you just joining us one of the be head of the board of trustees called for this to be the last year for bobby bowden is head coach about<person player="christian ponder" race="white" position="QB">christian ponder</person>marques always a threat to take off and run with that football i did the shotgun here fires incomplete it could have gone to either one of two receivers either read or <person player="rod owens" race="UNK" position="WR">owens</person> mark you said if they had both receivers obviously in the same area that was a broken coming broken around right there but they were both wide open watch this thing develops i mean mark they were both open they just simply distracted each other and now the freshmen the freshman kicker<person player="dustin hopkins" race="white" position="K">dustin hopkins</person>he s only won four for between 40 and 49 this 144 one of the kickers four field goal anyway getting involved in the game what about that from 45 yards out fix tiny pulls it to the left so that breaks the streak of five consecutive scores for florida state offensively in georgia tech capitalize when we come back well find out back in tallahassee georgia tech with the ball first down in 10 from their own 20 six <person player="josh nesbitt" race="UNK" position="QB">nesbitt</person> back to pass downfield caught by thomas and he s going to score to marius thomas touchdown but there s a flag on the play you got it behind a juco jenny j mark the only question was it offensive pass interference or defensive pass interference it was defensive pass interference and weve been talking about<person player="demaryius thomas" race="nonwhite" position="WR">demaryius thomas</person>we talked about him at the end of the first half how he had not touched not touch to football he just touched the football average is a hundred and seven yards a game receiving number one in the acc well bobby just got 73 on that jump and mark this is a big strong powerful man who can run <person player="greg reid" race="UNK" position="DB">greg</person> <person player="bert reed" race="UNK" position="WR">reed</person> excuse me jenna jay the corner he just went up and muscled him that was like a postup that was shaq against a 5foot twoinch point guard i mean that was a no contest the paul johnson has to grin over there on the sidelines ive never seen as many big plays in a football game as this football game market for tameria s thomas man this was a mismatch he s yelling hey i got a mouse in the house here throw it up i got a <person player="jabaris little" race="UNK" position="TE">little</person> one and the timing he was very patient timed it 63 225 pounds you look at this georgia tech offense they have a big physical quarterback in<person player="josh nesbitt" race="UNK" position="QB">josh nesbitt</person>215 225 if a nfl fullback in<person player="jonathan dwyer" race="UNK" position="RB">jonathan dwyer</person>and they have an nfl wide receiver in<person player="demaryius thomas" race="nonwhite" position="WR">demaryius thomas</person>keep in mind chan gailey recruited all three of these players all three of these players are dynamic and when you put them in a triple option offense like this it is very hard to defend that kind of talent kind of in the mold of a guy that played there a few years ago calvin johnson yeah 63 229 pounds and dakota watson meanwhile being worked on on the sidelines for florida state bob how tough is it to recruit good receivers to an option program like georgia tech is a fallacy or not well well find out you know we will find out because obviously the academies run it they recruit under a whole different scenario i mean the guys that are gonna go to the academies go you know thomas was recruited by shan gailey with the idea he was going to run in a pro offense but with that in mind he went out and recruited<person player="stephen hill" race="UNK" position="WR">stephen hill</person>im talking about paul johnson a bigtime receiver from georgia you know so in some ways it s pretty good to play in that offense when you can be the featured live receiver like that here we go this is <person player="bert reed" race="UNK" position="WR">reed</person> on the kickoff return still in his feet and <person player="bert reed" race="UNK" position="WR">reed</person> brought down to the 25yard line so the last time florida state s offense was on the field they were stopped and then subsequently missed a 45yard field goal attempt by<person player="dustin hopkins" race="white" position="K">dustin hopkins</person>this time<person player="christian ponder" race="white" position="QB">christian ponder</person>will start things from his own 24 yard line mark not 22 weber this point but again georgia tech in a one place scoring drive that defense is right back on the field now you think about the first half with as many places georgia tech s defensive play i hate to complain because the offense is scoring but that old scoring 2fast thing could eventually be a factor for this georgia tech defense i mean theyve been out there a long time and just football games in it we could get done on this series <person player="christian ponder" race="white" position="QB">ponder</person> hands it off another huge play first <person player="chris thompson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">thompson</person> with a nice run deep into georgia tech territory stealing back a <person player="jabaris little" race="UNK" position="TE">little</person> bit of head momentum 48 yards and all youre gonna see a good block by<person player="jermaine thomas" race="UNK" position="RB">jermaine thomas</person>out of the backfield how about the speed i mean florida state offensively looks so much faster<person player="chris thompson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris thompson</person>a freshman number 23 watch the block out here on the perimeter right there by <person player="demaryius thomas" race="nonwhite" position="WR">demaryius</person> excuse me by<person player="jermaine thomas" race="UNK" position="RB">jermaine thomas</person>marco s an excellent block out of that was first and ten <person player="christian ponder" race="white" position="QB">ponder</person> a <person player="jabaris little" race="UNK" position="TE">little</person> bubble screen incomplete intended from bert read to be second down in ten b the explosive plays in this football game have been shot it has been shocking want to be a defensive coordinator even know how much fun it would be to be a head coach tonight bob leave us scratching her head second and ten coming up<person player="christian ponder" race="white" position="QB">christian ponder</person>quarterback he s had a hot hand for most of the night dont man that s earned his undergrad degree in just two and a half years graduated magna laude completes this one to <person player="taiwan easterling" race="UNK" position="WR">easterling</person> and he s filling that with a hard hit by<person player="brad jefferson" race="UNK" position="LB">brad jefferson</person>on the play tell you<person player="brad jefferson" race="UNK" position="LB">brad jefferson</person>has made a couple plays tonight i mean he can run that was a great effort right there a cc coat defense of the player last week against mississippi state had some injuries last year he s the leader of this thing his teammates call him gladiator such a fierce competitor ill tell you can change the football right there from the 22 incomplete so the seminole offense last two times out now have been stymied and stop that was intended for<person player="taiwan easterling" race="UNK" position="WR">taiwan easterling</person>and in comes the placekicker again and <person player="dustin hopkins" race="white" position="K">hopkins</person> marquis missed two in a row now he missed up at boston college 37 yards in the fourth quarter he missed that last attempt there s some pressure obviously on this young freshman kicker out of houston texas but this one s five yards closer from 40 yards out for the lead and he knocked that one through it s true florida state with a threepoint lead with 1202 to go mr jones along with bob davie the first nine possessions of the game combined for both teams resulting in nine touchdowns coming up davy jones locker werewolf talk about one of the great stories and florida state football over the last couple of years and take our florida poll take a <person player="jabaris little" race="UNK" position="TE">little</person> inventory football in the state you have to feel like georgia tech right now holding florida state to a field goal particularly after that big run by<person player="chris thompson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris thompson</person>that s a win in this game if you can hold the other team to a field goal it s a win for your defense the second half rhythm has been a <person player="jabaris little" race="UNK" position="TE">little</person> bit different for both offenses florida state s defense recovered a fumble on georgia tech s first offensive possession of the second half with any look at georgia tech s defense coming up with a couple of stops here in the third you know we just saw a shot of paul johnson mark you talked about the impact he s had came in last year to georgia tech he beat miami florida state in georgia last year it s been seven years it was seven years since theyd beaten georgia was 12 years since theyd beat florida state his impact on his georgia tech program has been really remarkable or estate back on track snap their two game losing streak that one goes out the back of the endzone nice kickoff and theyve only had one losing season here under bobby bowden he s only had two losing seasons it measures up against other iconic sports franchises in ucla were just two losing seasons last 44 steelers and celtics with 13 and 14 respectively bob that really puts things into perspective how successful and the success combined with the longevity that bobby buy and the perception that things are crumbling he s not at a losing season at florida state what 33 years and you know what eternal weathered something much worse than this several years ago it s the louisville transfer<person player="anthony allen" race="UNK" position="RB">anthony allen</person>stopped up let s tackle me by <person player="greg reid" race="UNK" position="DB">greg</person> green allen had a 60 yard run in the first half second down and six coming up 14 straight top five appearances at the end of the season they won or had a share of the acc title in 12 of the first 14 seasons in the league some people thought when they first came into the acc boy that this thing s over they may never lose seems like a long time ago now <person player="josh nesbitt" race="UNK" position="QB">nesbitt</person> on the toss and good assignment football as dryers brought down by robinson behind the line of scrimmage every peoples run down courtney at the 21 loss of three<person player="jamie robinson" race="UNK" position="DB">jamie robinson</person>s had a good night mark and run support he s come up and supported that option if you notice georgia tech theyve given florida state the same formation really over and over and that s the nature of paul johnson he finds something he likes he knows how youre defending it hell stay in that formation it give them a lot of trips formation the one side still running the option this is where you wanted here s that trips formation again you look at three receivers lined up to the field a lot of sprint out pass in this situation right here <person player="martin frierson" race="UNK" position="DB">martin</person> <person player="josh nesbitt" race="UNK" position="QB">nesbitt</person> is going to talk things over calling the timeout well take one right along with them florida state leading by field goal when we come back to tallahassee coaches in college football history bobby bowden 34 years at all on campus weathering the storm here too like his team leading by ten and a half to go here s a third down and long for georgia tech on the pitch and it looks like alan got the first down they ran the pitch into the boundary and a 12 yard pickem wow you talk about having faith in your system bob mark you watch right here now it s third down and ten watch mr alexander number 16 hell show up into the boundary right here he s ago there was a linebacker they moved to the secondary right there excellent crack back block right there by<person player="roddy jones" race="UNK" position="RB">roddy jones</person>it is third and ten and he runs the triple option into the boundary for a first down now theyre back in the trip set to the field that theyve been in all night jones in motion has been back to pass down field and incomplete free peoples was looking over the other shoulder and <person player="josh nesbitt" race="UNK" position="QB">nesbitt</person> taps his chest said my back a <person player="jabaris little" race="UNK" position="TE">little</person> bit off target <person player="martin frierson" race="UNK" position="DB">martin</person> what happens on that last third down you get in your conventional third down defense anticipating pass and you have no chance on the triple option paul johnson has the courage that go ahead and run it so it s so difficult to defend it but that first down incompletion really helps florida state now because second and long paul johnson will probably run the football right here toss into the boundary good support off the corner number 20<person player="patrick robinson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">patrick robinson</person>and <person player="nick moody" race="UNK" position="DB">moody</person> coming up to make the stop on the play but still a six yard pickup nigel marven push dakota watson at linebacker on with a groin injury were told be third down and for a lot of skeptics botwin paul johnson came to georgia tech and randy wishbone in the acc some people thought it wouldnt work now theyve lost the element surprise now the final frankston i played it against a bunch of years i was never surprised by them tonight a heck of a time defending on 3rd and 4th <person player="josh nesbitt" race="UNK" position="QB">nesbitt</person> keeps it himself and gets the first down another third down conversion picked up six that time mark i want you to watch this play were gonna dive the fullback right here he s going to read it and then he s going to duck up inside here this may be the best play in football he reads that three technique the three technique closes he follows right off the butt of the three technique with a lead blocker the old quarterback gun is unstoppable if it s executed the right way this time he gives it to try our tyre got about three on the plane you know <person player="josh nesbitt" race="UNK" position="QB">josh</person> nesbit s 319 total yards last week against mississippi state is the most since reggie ball had 367 more years ago talk about a couple of productive quarterbacks for georgia tech past and present <person player="marcus wright" race="UNK" position="RB">marcus</person> s go back to last year oh eight they had 408 yards rushing against georgia for 72 against miami rushing those are two defensive teams with all panas so any of those skeptics about this offense that was put to rest last year doubt this is flier again stopped up after a gain of about two to five to go on third down coming up<person player="jonathan dwyer" race="UNK" position="RB">jonathan dwyer</person>last year s acc player of the year a 69 yard touchdown run in the second quarter this game now with a <person player="jabaris little" race="UNK" position="TE">little</person> bit more of a traditional rhythm to it in the second half it s settled down a <person player="jabaris little" race="UNK" position="TE">little</person> bit just a <person player="jabaris little" race="UNK" position="TE">little</person> right now georgia tech third and four marker dont go for it on fourth down so it s two down territory for them theyd only need to make four yards into downtown why on the toss couple missed tackles tillis p andrade jones jones with the first down for georgia tech at the 41 he picked up 11 that was a great effort by riding jones watch<person player="jamie robinson" race="UNK" position="DB">jamie robinson</person>the strong safety come up right there he gets caught inside that is a good hard run though by<person player="roddy jones" race="UNK" position="RB">roddy jones</person>no dislocated his wrist in the offseason lifting this brother darius is a running back at air force so he knows about that up his family now gun i love this stuff 10 player the georgia tech drive is jones gets arrest heck of a name too and off to the fullback boy when they can get you six yards at a time like that bob that really adds to your game plan<person player="jonathan dwyer" race="UNK" position="RB">jonathan dwyer</person>that time the first man through tell you you look at these florida state defensive players mark they hate and i cant emphasize it enough hate playing against this offense the defensive line i want to run up the field sack the quarterback the dbs want to play mantoman coverage and break on the ball and make intercept it forces everybody out of their comfort zone for one night i see as pit keeps himself and gets close to another georgia tech first down this one is going to be marked about a yard short got three on the play well if youre just joining us six minutes to go in the third order as we come up on 20 minutes before midnight eastern time we endured a 78 minute lightning delay because employment weather in the area we didnt resume play until about 9:40 pm eastern time after wed already played about six and a half minutes in the first quarter both teams have gone to the locker rooms and come back out were given a 10minute warmup period and that s when things really got interesting third and one one might have gotten it on the second effort he got the proverbial left foot spot and it looks like he s about a half a yard short of the first down <person player="jonathan dwyer" race="UNK" position="RB">dwyer</person> comes up a <person player="jabaris little" race="UNK" position="TE">little</person> bit lame he s limping he was shaken up in the miami game couple of games the game go to mark they dont go for it you probably dont get that quarterback duck play again go right now what youre seeing is the ball control element you say how the tempo of this game s changed now youre seeing the ball control because they havent broken off a big play but you got to think the quarterback<person player="josh nesbitt" race="UNK" position="QB">josh nesbitt</person>right here might sneak it but probably the quarterback down ive got the size and got the first down keeping that florida state defense on the field now 2 for 2 on fourth down tonight has been a night of big plays<person player="anthony allen" race="UNK" position="RB">anthony allen</person>this time going 60 yards and wire the pullback bouncing outside 69 yards the pig long pass to the big wide receiver<person player="demaryius thomas" race="nonwhite" position="WR">demaryius thomas</person>thomas monday bye after the great pass what youre seeing right now is keeping that ball away all control nice run by <person player="markus white" race="UNK" position="DL">markus</person> right <person player="markus white" race="UNK" position="DL">markus</person> right got his first touch of the night right there he picked up seven yards as we approach four minutes to go in the third it s been a night a big place i mean you look at georgia tech 20plus yard place four times and then you look at florida state seven of those planes but keep in mind last week boston college with seven plays of over 20 against florida state right on rhythm and up was to flyer and wire getting the first down just inside the 20yard line got about three on them<person player="jonathan dwyer" race="UNK" position="RB">jonathan dwyer</person>when you talk about his recruitment boy what a great catch that was for the yellowjackets mob that came down to florida georgia and right here at florida state and auburn those were the finalists for him after making an adjustment to the offense last year wasnt really much of an adjustment if you want to call it that fourteen hundred yards on the ground but you know what he came in is probably an ai tailback thinking about chan gailey in that prostyle offense and i asked him that question we were on that conference call said look if you had to do it again knowing you were going to be in the triple option would you make that decision again and he handled it very well diplomatically very diplomatically but i mean it s worked out great for him now he will have to transition obviously at the next level the paul johnson says he has excellent hands can really catch the football this guy s going to be a bigtime nfl player i really believe in having a pretty productive night got the first down we tend to go in the third quarter they have just held the football mark for eight minutes and 40 seconds right here the toss got good numbers on the edge right touchdown georgia tech shredding the seminole defense for 19 in the score arent they carved them again mr alexander who moved back to safety it s almost unfair to make the kids from linebacker but because of injuries they had to do it plays in the secondary this week against this offense i think you look at the looks on the faces some of the fans just unable to stop that juggernaut offensively of georgia tech that is the first two rushing touchdown of wright s career if you look on their faces this on offense looks foreign to him you know theyre not used to seeing this kind of triple option kind of a game theyre having a hard time figuring it out nobody s having fun here except these guys in a <person player="markus white" race="UNK" position="DL">white</person> shirt and only the guys on offense in a <person player="markus white" race="UNK" position="DL">white</person> shirt yeah defensive players theyre like we got to go out there again mark ive been there ive been there playing and defending this kind of offense it is no fun and these wide receivers from georgia tech are flocking these florida state defensive backs out there on the perimeter too but that was a 16 play 80yard drive they used up a <person player="jabaris little" race="UNK" position="TE">little</person> over 9 minutes on the clock just the type of drive that will sap the strength of the defense especially in these kind of weather conditions let s go back and take a look at this option they come with the jest true vere option youre going to watch a block right there by number 24 every peoples and in downfield the freshman wide receiver<person player="stephen hill" race="UNK" position="WR">stephen hill</person>excellent blocking on the perimeter mark and <person player="marcus wright" race="UNK" position="RB">marcus</person> right the <person player="jabaris little" race="UNK" position="TE">little</person> sophomore slot back i saw you quoted in one of those articles this week that if you ever got back into coaching not that youre going to because im not gonna let you that you would run this offense there s no question mark you have to have an athletic director it has enough courage to hire you like ratico bik s dude from georgia tech welcome back everyone to tallahassee in the 22nd meeting between georgia tech and florida state becoming a very memorable one because of its offensive output ill tell you is watching this game bud foster he s sitting at home right now they meet impressively today boston college right but foster the defensive coordinator virginia tech sitting there right now this he screwed up his evening he started already on saturday night st mark you got guarantee he s watching this drawn in he s played against a bunch of tripleoption and they played georgia tech very well but this has his attention and will be there and landed next week six oclock a game yep 6:00 pm eastern kickoff on espn2

the twopoint win kirk ferentz his crew really getting it done this year ranked number 12<person player="christian ponder" race="white" position="QB">christian ponder</person>ilyn getting it done on the field and in the classroom this time hands it off to thomas who goes nowhere speaking of <person player="christian ponder" race="white" position="QB">ponder</person> we talked about it a <person player="jabaris little" race="UNK" position="TE">little</person> bit earlier has his degree already earned it in two and a half years graduating magna laude and is now working on his mba in finance his doctorate before he leaves for a state which brings to mind davy jones locker another real quick story myron roll road scholar well he s going to have his mba and he s going to have all those degrees he s going to play an nfl for a while im making that prediction right now but ive enrolled me his story after this play on third and four coming up completes it at the 40yard line we get a penalty right here on this play i think were going to get a whole i think they held in derek morgan number 91 mark and that is a huge penalty right there it s going to negate this play what holy offense that s a tenyard relatively speaking this has been a penalty three night and a punt free nightmare well getting back to one of the great feelgood stories for florida state over the last year myron roll the road scholar played safety last year recently spent five days in <person player="tevin washington" race="UNK" position="QB">washington</person> dc last wednesday flew to london landed there on thursday has been making a lot of great things happen he will with his master s of medical anthropology so guys like <person player="christian ponder" race="white" position="QB">ponder</person> and role really putting the student in studentathlete and a student of the game condor completing that pass to <person player="louis givens" race="UNK" position="WR">givens</person> and myron role recently announced that he s an open up a couple of clinics in the bahamas he s a native of bahamas actually his parents are from there he was born stakes but really doing some great things bob there s some cynics when it comes to how much kids actually get into the classroom but these guys a great example of the good side no question and certainly kristin <person player="christian ponder" race="white" position="QB">ponder</person> the same kind of story jimbo fisher was telling us yesterday you know he could potentially be a rhodes scholar as well right now though he is on a path taking him directly to the nfl but youre right i mean so many of those stories we dont hear about in college football under a minute to go now in the third quarter and a timeout called by georgia tech marquette holding penalty right there on third down obviously critical right here and you know right now bobby bowden contemplating going for it on fourth down not so much that he wants to go for it on fourth and three but he doesnt want to give that football back to georgia tech right here bobby bowden georgia state trying to turn the beat around tonight trying to snap their twogame losing streak off to their worst start in 23 years need one badly tonight trailing by four tarun back deep calls for the fair catch at the 16 yard line a dangerous punt returner he s run two back four touchdowns already this year but no return after that 46yard punt hell be first down in ten that s the first punt tonight in the game and florida state s defense now coming off that last drive where georgia tech kept the ball for eight minutes right here s been a lot of critical possessions theyll probably a lot more points but this possession right here particularly because georgia tech kept the ball so long on that last drive is key but they have to find a way mark to get some run support out there on the perimeter their d bees are getting blocked again that trips for mason has been there all night for georgia tech on first down in ten from their own 17 <person player="josh nesbitt" race="UNK" position="QB">nesbitt</person> tosses it good blocking on the edge again and an eightyard gain for rowdy jones second down and shorten coming up for georgia tech watch this blonde by<person player="demaryius thomas" race="nonwhite" position="WR">demaryius thomas</person>i said they were getting blocked florida state s dbs watch this collision right here out on the open field weve got an injured player down too but yeah bob<person player="demaryius thomas" race="nonwhite" position="WR">demaryius thomas</person>really did a great job how important to have receivers that are willing to do that in this smark in this offense and theyre doing so much of this crack back right here and that s a legal block he had his head in front right there the way florida state is playing their run support with that safety coming for the pitch on the weak side when they crack them that corner has to replace them and right now i mean theyre just scheming them a <person player="jabaris little" race="UNK" position="TE">little</person> bit on perimeter run support but youre right i mean that s 63 225 pounds coming down theyre cracking on a guy that didnt see him coming number 10<person player="nick moody" race="UNK" position="DB">nick moody</person>a freshman you know florida state with so many young db s mark and injuries in the secondary<person player="patrick robinson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">patrick robinson</person>was nicked up and had <person player="nick moody" race="UNK" position="DB">moody</person> get the start tonight for jalan <person player="jajuan harley" race="UNK" position="DB">harley</person> who s injured in practice all week did a <person player="jabaris little" race="UNK" position="TE">little</person> bit of work on thursday but he was ill and there was a look at 79<person player="sean bedford" race="UNK" position="DL">sean bedford</person>who s now going to go into the locker room he s the center bob the snapper so you always wonder about what that next snap will be the exchange between the new snapper whoever comes in the center and<person player="josh nesbitt" race="UNK" position="QB">josh nesbitt</person>the new and now is dan voss talk about coming in cold second and to in motion clean exchange in a first down for georgia tech bob this game has suddenly taken on a georgia tech feel and rhythm to it hasnt it no question about it i mean that was the typical ball control drive we saw in the last possession theyre starting to do it again and that center you mentioned it just came in the game arc he had an excellent block right there on that carry by <person player="jonathan dwyer" race="UNK" position="RB">dwyer</person> in the first down that s going to be the end of the third quarter of play georgia tech leading by four points in tallahassee under the lights the city of glow the state capital over to chris s breath back for the fourth right after this welcome back to everyone to college football primetime on espn started the fourth quarter georgia tech with a four point lead in tallahassee flyers stopped up after a gain of about two on the play time now for our allstate good hands and that was the miss in the third quarter by<person player="dustin hopkins" race="white" position="K">dustin hopkins</person>which could prove to be a game difference maker allstate has donated one point eight million dollars academic general scholarship funds since 2005 allstate good hands field goal net program <person player="dustin hopkins" race="white" position="K">hopkins</person> was on the bike a few moments ago hope he wasnt trying to ride out of town because it i miss second and eight <person player="jonathan dwyer" race="UNK" position="RB">dwyer</person> with nowhere to go itll be third and long but it s not a situation the mob that georgia tech has had to sweat for most of the night well it s the situation you want to put this georgia tech offense in obviously you know the problem<person player="josh nesbitt" race="UNK" position="QB">josh nesbitt</person>quarterback draw is always a play out of this formation theyre probably gonna be in trips three wide receivers of the field sprint out pass quarterback draw got a lot of things to defend plus theyll run the option on you as we saw earlier on 13 low areas thomas split wide to the top of your screen as but rolls his way the pass complete to the big wide receiver thomas who makes the catch for the first down he was working against <person player="greg reid" race="UNK" position="DB">greg</person> <person player="bert reed" race="UNK" position="WR">reed</person> and he picked up 11 on the play mark there s the sprint out pass and it s really a mismatch right now i mean<person player="demaryius thomas" race="nonwhite" position="WR">demaryius thomas</person>at 63 230 a man on a young freshman corner <person player="greg reid" race="UNK" position="DB">greg</person> <person player="bert reed" race="UNK" position="WR">reed</person> regardless of how talented he is and that was another big first down keeping that clock ticking they have kept the ball away from florida state in the second half hey how does thomas make so many big plays and keep that uniform<person player="preston lyons" race="UNK" position="RB">preston lyons</person>in the ballgame now number 46 <person player="josh nesbitt" race="UNK" position="QB">nesbitt</person> keeps it himself and picks up another good chunk of real estate got about six that time it would be second down to the floor keep that clock running ball control in one thing playing against this triple option when paul johnson finds a formation that he likes he likes the trips formation right now mickey andrews has one way he s playing that trips formation hell play the whole game in that formation because he is totally in his comfort zone right now mickey didnt realize how much trips he was going to get in this game but he s getting it every day second down in for <person player="preston lyons" race="UNK" position="RB">lyons</person> dillon ball game give it to the first man through its lions and he gets enough for the first down <person player="jacobbi mcdaniel" race="UNK" position="DL">mcdaniel</person> for florida state came with his hat off to vick took mark jones along with bob davie here at tallahassee florida bobby bowden field at doak campbell stadium florida state off to its worst start in 23 years at 2 and 3 coming into the night georgia tech coming into this game with a record of 4 &amp; 1 overall 2 &amp; 1 in conference play and a win tonight keeps them in the race and this has been a night a big place this was<person player="anthony allen" race="UNK" position="RB">anthony allen</person>60 yards down the sideline setting up a georgia tech score but that wasnt all jonathan wire to this one 69 yards made a house call<person player="christian ponder" race="white" position="QB">christian ponder</person>had a

position="WR">demaryius thomas</person>that s just an unfair situation jumpball he wins all the time and right now what happens as we still have the injured player down on the field if youre<person player="christian ponder" race="white" position="QB">christian ponder</person>and youre jimbo fisher you start panicking right now because all of a sudden that ball has been kept away from you and georgia tech now is kind of in that methodical mode he doesnt look real panicked over there but you start to feel like were gonna run out of possessions in this game so if georgia that can take this ball down and score you start running out of opportunities if youre jimbo fisher id say how about jimbo fisher yeah we sat with bobby bowden yesterday and when he got up and left that meeting we were in i know you felt the same thing i felt how would you like to follow this guy at florida state not easy now i mean what steps of a legend guy that has accomplished so much in his time at florida state he is the coach in waiting the head coach designate whenever it is that bobby bowden decides to step down and the interesting aspect of that arrangement is that if fisher is not the head coach by 2011 there is a reported 5 million payment that has to be made in discussions of perhaps team of people being motivated to get the framework of a contractor that s for another day as we go back to wendy in the studio mark thank you football of a different kind usa soccer has clinched a 2010 world cup berth with a 32 win over on duras that was landon donovan to make it 31 the stars the stripes

college he was a walkon is now healthy now on scholarship lewis gibbons is an exciting guy as well number 89 not very big he can run as well if youre trying to get things in motion here with kind of seconds to go into play clock ella furtive motion <person player="taiwan easterling" race="UNK" position="WR">easterling</person> with the cats in the first down at the 30 yard line for the seminoles

protection you know rich tricking the offensive line coach has done an excellent job with some young players up front their pass protection has been outstanding finishing this from an offensive line that s struggled a lot last year bob theyre three true freshmen that played upfront last season first and ten <person player="christian ponder" race="white" position="QB">ponder</person> this time sack just as we blotted them in the ball comes loose and georgia tech gets it back oh so hon tom go on the hit and the bumble ensued georgia tech gets it back off their ninth sack of the season tom go part came unblocked<person player="jason peters" race="UNK" position="DL">jason peters</person>recovered the fumble but two big mistakes by florida state the drop pass and an unblocked tonga forces the fumble bobby s always been an asset to us but but i do think it s probably time for us to make a change i believe that it s more than just football that he s about i believe that he helps the kids off the film as much as i think a jimbo fisher is i think hell be a great coach someday bobby bowden i think nobody can top them nobody can replace i think it s sad that it s a very end of his career theyre gonna tarnish his reputation by asking him to leave i think it s a ridiculous request he wants to retire this year well have a party for him if he doesnt his decision that s the voice off the street and it s incomplete intended for the freshmen steven <person player="stephen hill" race="UNK" position="WR">hill</person> well you heard what some of the fans think you see some of the sentiment here s a look at our espncom sportsnation poll what is bobby bowden for florida state right now 58% say liability 42% say asset over 72,000 votes have been cast if you want to vote log on to espncom search sports nation a flag on that last play and player injured back at the 28 yard line mark this is going to be a major penalty<person player="kendall smith" race="UNK" position="LB">kendall smith</person>number 29 let s take a look at it youre gonna see them right there the middle linebacker coming around right here hard to see right there this will be a better shot at it youre going to see smith coming late here yeah i mean it was definitely helmet the helmet contact no question about that i mean he didnt launch himself at it mark the helmet to helmet contact has been a point of emphasis for the officials this year in college football and again the tough thing with those calls is always be inconsistent with your interpretation of the call what was that thing that the other thing that came out of <person player="josh nesbitt" race="UNK" position="QB">nesbitt</person> s helmet jacobi <person player="jacobbi mcdaniel" race="UNK" position="DL">mcdaniel</person> the freshman defensive lineman who started tonight injured walking off the field but that was a key penalty because it would have been second and 10 instead it s a 15yard penalty ball at midfield under 10 minutes to go georgia tech with a fourpoint lead we retain because of their offensive style very capable of milking the clock and getting chunks of yards like that six and seven at a time <person player="josh nesbitt" race="UNK" position="QB">nesbitt</person> and he victim 9 and close to another first down just a <person player="jabaris little" race="UNK" position="TE">little</person> schematic play of the quarterback again picks up eight yards mark on that <person player="jabaris little" race="UNK" position="TE">little</person> play right there second end to florida state trying to stem the tide and bobby bowden trying to fight his critics of course a lot of speculation about the relationship amongst the coaches and the coaching staff a lot riding on this defensive series not only for florida state this season mark but for florida state football bobby i promise and esbit keeps it himself and gets the first down keeping the clock moving i know six the key possession we asked bobby bowden about his relationship with jimbo fisher who is the head coach in waiting fisher says you know he s he s from modest beginnings in west virginia he played for terry bowden at salem and it s sanford and actually when terry went to sanford a fisher transferred and played for him there and a bobby bowden says that you know jimbo is like part of the family known him since he was literally a kid almost of course he calls everyone a kid right nesbit with another first down for georgia tech and you sense that this defense just wearing down a <person player="jabaris little" race="UNK" position="TE">little</person> bit for the seminoles bobby bowden just watching helplessly a pickup of 13 on the plant mark you look at bobby bowden he s clearly the ceo he s been the ceo for 15 years but what s so frustrating when youre just the ceo you cant solve the problem i mean what are you going to do now you cant put that headset all of a sudden tell mickey to play the three technique a <person player="jabaris little" race="UNK" position="TE">little</person> bit different and that s what s so frustrating if youre not coaching you cant get the problem solved and theyre getting carved right now and has been with another pickup of boy a <person player="jabaris little" race="UNK" position="TE">little</person> bit of contact there by <person player="moses mccray" race="UNK" position="DL">mccray</person> well bobby bowden was asked about his coaching style and his affinity sometimes for delegating here s what he had to say about ive always used this philosophy all my life and i like this more than anybody else i dont think so hire the best people you can get didnt have sense enough to leave them alone i dont like to be micromanaged and im not gonna micromanage you you know you you get the job done for a long long time they have been getting it done here at florida state this is <person player="josh nesbitt" race="UNK" position="QB">nesbitt</person> in a purple forest states got it lisbon took it back he stole that ball back that was amazing mark i mean florida state cannot stop georgia tech but georgia tech pops it up nigel car and then <person player="josh nesbitt" race="UNK" position="QB">nesbitt</person> gets it back he watch this i mean they just dropped the pitch right there nigel car picks it up incredible turn and in another turn we said it would be that kind of night and if youre bobby bowden with all that s swirling around in this stadium and these fans how much was riding on that plate right there mark and bob because of the double change of possession it s a first down because of georgia tech for georgia tech and that clock just keeps ticking mark the angst continuing to build for florida state supporters <person player="josh nesbitt" race="UNK" position="QB">nesbitt</person> keeps it himself run by car but a gain of three yards on the play as this game progresses right here late in the fourth quarter for the state cant stop georgia tech georgia stick only way they get stopped is on some errant pitches in this football game paul johnson may just take the pitch out of it and just give you the full back in the quarterback from here on out because they cant stop them if they just execute the offense florida state with two timeouts remaining second and seven coming up timeout called on the field by georgia tech back after this espn s college football primetime put you by bud light with the just right taste that s not too heavy not too light the difference is drinkability welcome back everyone to bill campbell stadium here in tallahassee the state capital of florida the second half has been a totally different story offensively especially for florida state after 35 points in the first half just a field goal in the second half 637 ago in the game second and seven as the pivots a missed tackle and that can be lethal <person player="josh nesbitt" race="UNK" position="QB">nesbitt</person> touchdown yellowjackets our<person player="kendall smith" race="UNK" position="LB">kendall smith</person>missed a tackle in the open field and<person player="josh

race="UNK" position="QB">josh nesbitt</person>abrir high three rushing touchdowns tell you he really does have a handle on his office mark what he has done the last two weeks go back to last week he had 23 carries against mississippi state he had 32 carries against north carolina and you know georgia tech has just kept the ball away from florida state in the second half i mean in time of possession is around 19 minutes for georgia tech to about five minutes for florida state well you wonder what the future holds for florida state if they cant make a comeback here down 11 points with about six and a half minutes to go this in minute very tumultuous week in the head of the board of trustees with university calling for an end to the bowden era at the end of this season lois <person

jimbo fisher looking with concern from the sidelines under six minutes to go <person player="christian ponder" race="white" position="QB">ponder</person> completes it that s burt reid race forward progress going to be marked around the 15 yard line it looks like or i think florida state needs to get up on that ball and go right now i mean dont be husband wasting a lot of time because you know they do whether they have three timeouts the two timeouts left spreading to feel a <person player="jabaris little" race="UNK" position="TE">little</person> bit here for receiver formation wander into

a couple tough plays but he s made a couple real good plays tonight he said were looking at four down territory here for florida state well a field goal makes it what a 4941 game which would be a onepossession game i think a lot depends right here mark on how much yardage they convert right here thirteen seven <person player="christian ponder" race="white" position="QB">ponder</person> forced to escape boy turns a corner<person player="christian ponder" race="white" position="QB">christian ponder</person>with a burst of speed and education and acceleration by the quarterback 14 yard curse

player="lonnie pryor" race="UNK" position="RB">lonnie pryor</person>in the backfield in the head of ourselves a <person player="jabaris little" race="UNK" position="TE">little</person> bit they got a score here first on second and goal and <person player="christian ponder" race="white" position="QB">ponder</person> gonna be sacked back at the 14 yard line by<person player="ben anderson" race="UNK" position="DL">ben anderson</person>and<person player="derrick morgan" race="UNK" position="DL">derrick morgan</person>third and goal coming up now youre going to see immediate pressure up the middle five<person player="ben anderson" race="UNK" position="DL">ben anderson</person>just goes unblocked mark and then derek morgan comes in and cleans it up 30 goal when we come back back in tallahassee the time of possession totally different from the first half throws it all right there mark says it all or stay with just one timeout remaining under touchdown in a flag on the play great catch by <person player="rod owens" race="UNK" position="WR">owens</person> well extend marking a great job i <person player="christian ponder" race="white" position="QB">ponder</person> of standing in there under some great pressure now theyre going to go for the twopoint conversion that was a great job on<person player="christian ponder" race="white" position="QB">christian ponder</person>hanging in there and delivering that football under pressure boys make some great throws tonight marc im impressed with this young man right here this is this makes it obviously a twopoint play to make it a 4946 football game right here last week in lost against boston college burton <person player="bert reed" race="UNK" position="WR">reed</person> on the reverse threw for a twopoint conversion with a run here honor is going to pass and incomplete perhaps a <person player="jabaris little" race="UNK" position="TE">little</person> bit of hot intended once again parolees so the difference is at five instead of three and a field goal does the seminoles no good oh and what a decision coming up here for bobby bowden let s take a look at this touch now first i want to want you to watch <person player="christian ponder" race="white" position="QB">ponder</person> stand in there he gets great pressure put on him right there by derek morgan and there you see the pass interference on<person player="michael peterson" race="UNK" position="DB">michael peterson</person>in the corner the watch <person player="christian ponder" race="white" position="QB">ponder</person> mark this is a courageous guy watch his eyes never does he sense that pressure that should have been held with the helmet right there let s take another look at bread <person player="brad jefferson" race="UNK" position="LB">jefferson</person> right there that was very close to a helmet the helmet but<person player="christian ponder" race="white" position="QB">christian ponder</person>standing in there but now if youre bobby bowden it s a fivepoint game you have one timeout you cannot stop georgia tech youve already tried one onside kick you almost get the feeling that georgia tech bob can earn four minutes and 14 seconds and to plucky s well you think they can theyre set up for onside return georgia tech theyre anticipating onside kick this is a very tough decision right here for bobby bowden there s no question about it florida state has already tried a an onside kick earlier tonight marburg if i felt i could stop them which youve had no reason to think you can stop them to this point i would kick the ball up but based on the way this game has gone hell probably go ahead and onside kick this football right here yellowjackets have their hands team right up around the 40yard line in this direction theyve got a good bounce it s recovered by the yellowjackets number eleven <person player="jaybo shaw" race="UNK" position="QB">jaybo</person> saw with the recover backup quarterback ah yes it is both tony <person player="kendrick stewart" race="UNK" position="DL">stewart</person> reemerged as a contender following his win last week enhances from our partner jimmy johnson answer back as the chase heads west the chase for the nascar sprint cup continues with pepsi 500 california s sunday at 2:30 pm eastern time on abc first down in ten now for georgia tech from florida state s 44 and ill be surprised if georgia tech pitches this football mark it s going to be eight while <person player="josh nesbitt" race="UNK" position="QB">nesbitt</person> fullback quarterback game as the teacher himself follows that big offensive tackle and guard <person player="joseph gilbert" race="UNK" position="OL">gilbert</person> and cellars through the hole or estate with one timeout remaining theyre gonna have to use that real judiciously and careful the shotgun so many teams are running the quarterback runs predetermined quarterback runs where the quarterbacks like a tailback they do the same thing out of the wishbone mark that time the fullback basically the lead blocker and these offenses are geared for these kind of situations everybody in a stadium knew theyre gonna run it they just gained five yards on a quarterback keeper you probably see the same play again right here that s what we get this time though a gain of only about two yards sets up third down in three three and a half minutes to go her state hoping to get it back one more time that was a good lick right there by<person player="kendall smith" race="UNK" position="LB">kendall smith</person>and the center was gone sorry bob seminoles called their last timeout well time now for our buffalo wild wings moment number 22 college football s top 30 plays of the last 13 years number 22 in his first collegiate game georgia freshman herschel walker ran through tennessee s bill bates for his first career touchdown walker eventually finished third in the heisman voting and led the undefeated bulldogs to a national championship rhyming and running with those big fights my god afraid follow the top three count down all season long on espn and abc but with all these spread option kind of offenses i kind of missed those big old fail backs like her girl on her eric dickerson george rogers right that day that big guy tailback is gone but look at these rushing statistics here tonight you have to think for down territory right here georgette s at mark seminoles got to stop him not once but twice shut the motto conferring with bobby bowden as but keeps it gets the first down and then some that takes the wind out of the seminoles collective sails a 17yard game boy<person player="josh nesbitt" race="UNK" position="QB">josh nesbitt</person>has masterfully crafted a great offense tonight for georgia tech and executed it will mark florida state anticipating the ball is going to be run inside dye the quarterback watch the defensive end just go inside right here and get pinned he just keeps the ball outside so florida state anticipating that <person player="jabaris little" race="UNK" position="TE">little</person> inside quarterback tuck the defensive running and runs inside and he goes outside bobbing look look frightening lee easier that time here s <person player="jonathan dwyer" race="UNK" position="RB">dwyer</person> nice hit and stop on the play by smith who came up mark ill tell you what im looking forward to virginia tech in georgia you think you think bud foster s still up the tines over here still watching us i know right down to the last minute huh frank beamer still watching to the georgia tech can hold on their hopes and their dreams for an acc title are still alive and that will be a great football game for us to do in atlanta next saturday looking forward to making the trip

everybody in this stadium knows that<person player="josh nesbitt" race="UNK" position="QB">josh nesbitt</person>is going to carry that football and you cannot stop i mean that is the beauty of the wishbone and paul johnson this is a big big win to come down here tonight with florida state as hot as they were offensively in the first half and on that florida state side line it s only going to get worse this was a frustrating frustrating game remember it was a week ago after the loss against boston college the head of the board of trustees of florida state university said we need to close out the bouton era after this season bobby bowden countering saying ill evaluate myself at the end of the season tk whether oh the school president of florida state in supporter bobby bowden saying they will make no changes until the end of the season but an important caveat he did say that any coach can step away when he wants to well florida state with 539 yards georgia tech with 532 and what is going through bobby bowden right now theyre going to drop to two and four overall and theyll lose three consecutive games for the first time ever in acc play theyve lost five of their last six in doak campbell stadium mark dont minimize what that means they gave it a good run tonight but coming up five points short georgia tech improves to five and one over all three in one in conference play
