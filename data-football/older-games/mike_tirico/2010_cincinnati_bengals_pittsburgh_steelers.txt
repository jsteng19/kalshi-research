florida and boy had the steelers out legacy of sinners ray mansfield my trusty domani boss and sid victims supera decade you know it s tough to be a senator in this league let alone a look this nut man is 21 years old and to come in here in his crowd noise and play in a no huddle offense with a team like the pittsburgh steelers is rare an offensive coordinator bruce arians call us if we had a revote four captains marquis county would be off that s a highly thought of then his defense in noodley moving around try to confuse the blocking schemes first down randall well cause they went back and got randall l from the washington redskins because he can come in off the bench throw the cape off and make a play to convert a third down the pittsburgh steelers brought back randall l l <person

roethlisberger</person> you have to play your rush with contained youll see the nice job by the pass rush of the defensive line staying in their lane not allowing ben the freedom and space to move around steelers this drive giving the bengals taste in their little nohuddle medicine let s again and <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> season honey jones so cincinnati s up there in that spot on either side of the center with a doublea pressure a lot but it doesnt necessarily mean theyre coming all the time from that way now they have a litany of things that they can do from that alignment and a lot of it is blitz and <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> s been conservative early he runs on both occasions here to the right of <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> and teams have had success against the steelers offense with their blitz packages the saints have success last week and last year in the two games against the steelers the bengals had success they didnt like the lift there he takes a timeout and i saw 72 <person player="jonathan scott" race="nonwhite" position="OT">jonathan scott</person> over there left tackle he s in for <person player="max starks" race="nonwhite" position="OT">max starks</person> for the moment it starts has a foot injury that they are looking at <person player="max starks" race="nonwhite" position="OT">max</person> has already missed a game this year for years starter on that revamped offensive line you were talking about john you know one of the things mike with this cincinnati defense is they just have not been able to get any kind of pass rush at all from their defensive line so defensive coordinator mike zimmer has got a blitz whether it be the doublea blitz package or right here he s going to put five cincinnati bengals on one side of the formation and <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> says whoa nellie ive never seen that defense these two teams know each other extremely well and the preparation is intense it s year round and every time these two teams play they show each other things that theyve never seen before there s a good one by mike zimmer again more than six everybody comes <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> keeps the plane he s just shy of the first down richards <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white"

number 70 <person player="jonathan scott" race="nonwhite" position="OT">jonathan scott</person> for watch their ears his way we got <person player="michael johnson" race="nonwhite" position="DE">michael johnson</person> down he cant bring him down big fan is big he s strong and look at the vision spinning around puck is a 4yard theyre caught by <person player="quan cosby" race="nonwhite" position="WR">quan cosby</person> at the 11th defense stops the bleeding it s been one of the biggest ongoing topics in this season concussions in the nfl fair or not the poster boy for the fines and the big hits has become steeler outstanding defensive player <person player="james harrison" race="nonwhite" position="LB">james harrison</person> the defensive player two years ago in the league five five thousand dollars that vince young hits seventy five thousand for that hit on cleveland mohammed massaquoi and last week twenty thousand dollars this hit on drew brees the concern of the continued fines brought <person player="james harrison" race="nonwhite" position="LB">harrison</person> to new york on tuesday of this past week to meet with nfl commissioner roger goodell who is here at the game tonight on separate business coincidence that he s here watching the steelers and bengals here tonight and in the conversation <person player="james harrison" race="nonwhite" position="LB">harrison</person> as we visited with him last night was very frustrated he didnt get closer a complete answer as to why do i feel like im being targeted as the poster boy for these hits and it s something that continues to be on the minds of all the steeler players even cocacola moly spoke out defending <person player="james harrison" race="nonwhite" position="LB">harrison</person> this week students teachers at the 12 cincinnati gets a first down guys when we sent with james harris your thoughts on what you heard from wes i heard a frustrated angry still guy you know but he s a very good football player and a hard football player like he s not a dirty football player and i think that needs to be said but <person player="james harrison" race="nonwhite" position="LB">james harrison</person> is intense he s very focused and he s a very regimented guy and he wants to do right he s been trained to play a hundred <person player="jeromy miles" race="UNK" position="DB">miles</person> an hour and that s what he s doing in all those hits that you saw okay those are subject to disagreement now we dont all disagree that those are illegal hits i think <person player="james harrison" race="nonwhite" position="LB">harrison</person> wants to do right and he s not a bad guy he s a fun guy to be around and he s very emotionally i think disturbed by the reputation of the guys right in this approach down one key point on this and we sat with mike tomlin this confusions for the players the defensive players are trying to find a target zone what s the safe place to go with their body and sometimes when theyre running player bobby <person player="james harrison" race="nonwhite" position="LB">james harrison</person> im coming after john my target is right there he got the ball i go to there he goes down weak weak hit heads i mean how can that be a defenders fought the defenders drop what the smasher i knock you out that s the frustration of all the defensive players especially with this steeler team mike tomlin please hey im a big supporter this initiative for safety what s the common sense way to you my intention gave me a couple of yards and to that last point when we talked to the commissioner before the game and he was on monday night countdown with michele tafoya he said he s just trying to make everybody aware good sound technique will prevent some of the injuries that happen when guys lead with their head so <person player="james harrison" race="nonwhite" position="LB">harrison</person> who told us that sometimes it s hard to find the way to play the right way now goes out there with the steeler defense trying to do it his way and the right way all at once court was about to expire the clock stopped

race="nonwhite" position="WR">chad</person> ochocinco post play with palmer over there seven years on the field together this time it was teo in conversation rare that palmer has been intercepted by the steelers for all the turnovers to steal his cause and he hasnt had been much against palmer firsttime 297 throws to shy of the record against pittsburgh that s frank ryan lost the football a second time to yard shy of the first down to hani jones the tackle and no changes guys still the two starters out on the pittsburgh offensive line mike back to <person player="carson palmer" race="white" position="QB">carson palmer</person> coming off the field and your face here that s one area i would like to see <person player="carson palmer" race="white" position="QB">carson</person> be more demonstrative and hitting on his widely seen it seems like he takes that and doesnt give it i think you need to start getting on hit in their face in nets later i mean go dan marino and tell them to shut up thirtytwo we lost the ball but took a couple of steps it s ridic and first down and goal the bengals have not been good in short yardage defense it s a predictable mantoman situation and there s the bullet <person player="mike wallace" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike wallace</person> oneonone with and nobody in pro football can run with this guy maybe desean jackson or chris johnson but <person player="mike wallace" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike wallace</person> can fly question is does he have it i say give it to him <person player="marvin white" race="UNK" position="DB">marvin</person> <person player="keenan lewis" race="nonwhite" position="DB">lewis</person> will throw the challenge fat flagon challenge that that looked good to me was like yeah it steps well see spiller s are looking at first and goal at the 8th if this is upheld the ruling on the field was a complete pass that will take a few looks at it my first thought live was built challenges it s a catch ill catch it three steps has always been a catch and it s fumble then it s fumbled out of bounds which is just your ball there he doesnt go to the ground he s got pretty clear control of the ball there to a heck of a play by hall to try to force the fumble in i coached a guy named joey galloway who could slide now this guy here <person player="mike wallace" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike wallace</person> he s got that kind of speed jaws for three three they say he runs and everybody that i talked to for the pittsburgh steelers said this guy has speed that makes you jealous i mean this guy can roar and 23 yards per catch look at that that s unheard of he averaged 194 last year those are the kind of electrifying numbers hit bob hayes put together when he was shredding you back in a day yeah and we got in this discussion was it who was faster <person player="mike wallace" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike wallace</person> desean jackson who can flatout fly but it was interesting the steeler guys who have to play <person player="mike wallace" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike wallace</person> thought that it was <person player="mike wallace" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike wallace</person> we asked the corners there jonathan <person player="johnathan joseph" race="nonwhite" position="DB">joseph</person> and <person player="leon hall" race="nonwhite" position="DB">leon hall</person> of cincinnati now you talked about <person player="mike wallace" race="nonwhite" position="WR">wallace</person> and leading the league in yards per catch the last guy to do that his first two years was wesley walker the old jet 30some odd years ago all right ron winter has the verdict on this camera yes sir i do on the field is confirmed with the ball in this position the runner took three steps then their ball was dislodged by the defender the fun will it forward out of bounds at the 9 yard line face it the 9 yard line first down cincinnati is charged for the team timeout i agree with iran that s a good it s a good job by the officials the policy what dont you like but the more time you spend with us job youre getting a good understanding along here you starting to see how to correct officials are some very cathartic to move it to the 9 not be a bengals can not earn a third challenge is if their next one is correct cathartic up thank you john s working on that first and goal for the steelers back up center lager skis snapping a flat theyll start offense number 79 fiveyard penalty remains first down stray <person

position="DE">rucker</person> it s tough when you lose a starter on the offensive line when you lose your starting center and a starting guard that s double trouble as you can see this is an area the field the steers the season the redzone <person player="rashard mendenhall" race="nonwhite" position="RB">mendenhall</person> to be eight that third and goal coming up right here these long yardage

hides what his 83rd career touchdown as the steelers extend the lead again to ted 177 steelers went to the super super slowmo as we were going to break there and you saw it was razor razor thin as <person player="hines ward" race="nonwhite" position="WR">hines ward</person> knee came down as the goal line that was the same angle that we showed and the replay before the extra point that was shown on the big board here so cincinnati saw this replay and had the opportunity to teach challenge if they chose to let s go that maqsuum those are the 36 cameras around the stadium all stitched together to magnify the image you guys want to challenge everything jaws you know what why is everything kenny my bedtime now the javelin rather than the completed early if it s the only point their question was was he being contacted as his team was down that millisecond before he crossed the plane weve been a took them back last year against the steelers good position for a twominute drill only

s a sicko incomplete william game came on the secondary blitz backtoback blitz is by the steelers this time <person player="william gay" race="nonwhite" position="DB">william gay</person> got through here clean that s unfortunate because <person player="jeff reed" race="white" position="K">jeff</person> johnson s wide opening into the short side of the field for an easy first ballot at box top is now you have a critical third down because the bengals are not in field goal position looking for jordan shipman there s a marker over there as shifty was trying to get free <person player="william gay" race="nonwhite" position="DB">gay</person> has the sack on the last play illegal contact defense number 22 first down at the pressure there s one defensive injury note for mike tomlin steam <person player="brett keisel" race="white" position="DE">brett keisel</person> the defensive end is out with a hamstring injury his return is questioned already banged up with the defensive end spot eric smith out but keys will now up or the steelers have been devastated by injuries this evening the biggest bass protections particularly right im very smith at the top of this done a nice job against lamar <person player="lamarr woodley" race="nonwhite" position="DE">woodley</person> the steelers sacks to this point next time the pass is caught by <person player="brian leonard" race="white" position="RB">leonard</person> and tackled by farrier minimal game it looked like <person player="jermaine gresham" race="nonwhite" position="TE">jermaine</person> grisham was wide open in the middle of field and <person player="carson palmer" race="white" position="QB">carson</person> just didnt have side simply cant keep the feet inbounds incomplete third down coming up that s disappointing it s too deep with mantoman underneath and that s where your slot receiver needs to come alive and win that time the rookie <person player="jordan shipley" race="UNK" position="WR">jordan shipley</person> oneonone with <person player="william gay" race="nonwhite" position="DB">william gay</person> and <person player="william gay" race="nonwhite" position="DB">gay</person> did a nice job in coverage but you have to be able to win as a slot receiver with mantoman with too deep over there that that too deep is the key john you could see could undercut the route when he got help over the top of course a real tight throw to <person player="carson palmer" race="white" position="QB">carson</person> to keep show of the video sir grissom incomplete near 33yard line a <person player="mike nugent" race="white" position="K">mike nugent</person> field goal attempt would be a 50yarder and here he comes well again it s too deep and it s mantoman underneath you go to rookie <person player="jordan shipley" race="UNK" position="WR">shipley</person> on one play then you come back to grisham on another third down play against mantoman coverage underneath these young guys got to step up and win and make big plays ohio born ohio state alum <person player="mike nugent" race="white" position="K">mike nugent</person> 51 yards to temperatures about 40 it s getting colder ball doesnt travel as far catch like this so the kicking game in general it s a 51yard kick on a 40 degree night it s not easy but it s been a game of bangle mistakes they have been known as the bumbles before <person player="bernard scott" race="nonwhite" position="RB">bernard scott</person> the opening kickoff fumbled but to a touchdown hubert cut walked by <person player="william gay" race="nonwhite" position="DB">william gay</person> he was to gain 10 nothing <person player="carson palmer" race="white" position="QB">carson palmer</person> pressure in his face from carrier intercepted by <person player="lawrence timmons" race="nonwhite" position="LB">timmons</person> and then just a moment ago from 61 and on a cold night you got to drive that and hit it hard you can try to drive it misses to the left and the steelers have a tenpoint lead in the ball at their own 41 yard line the problem is with that field position now you flipped the field in favor of the steelers they have two timeouts left 45 seconds ample time for <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> to move down the field at least in field goal range maybe we garner a touchdown out of this and pouncy comes back in its center with that lower right leg injury so the work he should smarta back in there so get one of their two entry offensive players back the 36 yard line to play with the tackler that s a great throw and here in the hole of cover two <person player="mike wallace" race="nonwhite" position="WR">wallace</person> got a release got back up in the void and <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> s stopped them with the throw nice concentration in a crowd <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> spike s it to kill the clock they didnt use one of their two timeouts 21 seconds remaining boy the one thing you just seen with ben he can get the ball into those tight windows and he just barns strong in that pocket and it comes out communication problem right now for the last bengal play when it s too deep and theyre doubling <person player="terrell owens" race="nonwhite" position="WR">owens</person> and their double and johnson <person player="jordan shipley" race="UNK" position="WR">shipley</person> or <person player="jermaine gresham" race="nonwhite" position="TE">gresham</person> they have to be able to win inside and if the steelers can double johnson in double <person player="terrell owens" race="nonwhite" position="WR">owens</person> all night long those two young guys have got to win inside went to this field goal lumpfish burger for <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">heath miller</person> incomplete as the pressure was coming on ben yeah <person player="chris crocker" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chris crocker</person> coming to the left of <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> forced him to get rid of the football he had a receiver open with ben jizz ran out of time in the pocket at quarterbacks clock was moving he knew he had to get rid of the ball before <person player="chris crocker" race="nonwhite" position="DB">crocker</person> got there the welding <person player="mewelde moore" race="nonwhite" position="RB">moore</person> was trying to block for he comes off as he s shaken up would be huge right here for the steelers this is it down once again where the bengals love the rush three any check down any kind of completion puts you in position for the field goal stan s stepping up while sitting hold on hit by a new query well youll see been right here and he s just trying to think first of all maybe i get a first down maybe i move this closely for the field go looking down the field now he steps up that s what thankful to expend the play and just got the ball little bit how well they got to make that catch that s how that s on the hands got to make that catch <person player="mike wallace" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike wallace</person> has made the plays down the field remember they have to replace santonio holmes a guy that s made a lot of plays for the steelers over the years bengals missed a 51yard and this is a 53 yarder from jeffery would equal his career law and read online and maxi one team makes their 50plus yarder the other one misses at a six point swing at the back end in the second quarter jeffery who has been criticized around pittsburgh for missing several field goals he had only made one of six field goals from 40 yards or more but mike talman told us last night ive got confidence if i god believed he could make self you are here s a lot of people this field all fed over there at heinz field with a ketchup bottle of this picture is the 40yarder who s a 45 yarder against the ravens last week in the dome a 51yard 6nothing really a couple of field goals but tonight on this cool night drove it low and nailed it from 53 little mike tomlin he knows this guy was five for five a couple of years ago in

the 37yard line a very smart play by <person player="carson palmer" race="white" position="QB">carson palmer</person> he seemed the corner with about an eight yard cushion on <person player="terrell owens" race="nonwhite" position="WR">terrell owens</person> is popped up and threw him the football get the first down with all this to deep coverage im surprised we havent seen <person

of these blitz pressures is trying to get palmer a second to throw the ball single dump down below i think were going to take that chance im always the safety back there now they change the coverage i

farrior</person> you have three downs left this second down and long any kind of completion to get you back in a convertible situation is big right now for the bengals dick lebeau is mixing it up and you have to be alert for <person player="jordan shipley" race="UNK" position="WR">shipley</person> in the slot theyre going to get to a maximum protection here grissom s in the backfield that should allow them to get palmer protection to work in the slide that s gilliam 20s got time here it s a suitcase the last two minutes triggered by the replay booth first catch of the nights of 15yard gain does setup third and five parts with faster detection it did a nice job pass protected and ochocinco makes an excellent catch on the sidelines he got it got it down as the ball is in need down goes to the ground maintains possession all the way through puts third and five at the 12 you have two plays to get five yards to keep the game alive 12 yards to take this game to a table and with a touchdown in his same formation please thinking the same thing as <person player="troy polamalu" race="nonwhite" position="DB">polamalu</person> is going back there with teo <person player="terrell owens" race="nonwhite" position="WR">owens</person> and ochocinco and <person player="chad johnson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">chad</person> palmer and all this talent on offense with hopes built by the

the afc north they swept all the division games but if they do not convert here on fourth down if they dont win theyll fall four games back with eight to go and essentially be out of it it always say the season comes down to this snap but it s pretty darn close incomplete for the markers again he and i tailor me that <person player="jordan shipley" race="UNK" position="WR">shipley</person> and dick lebeau a 73 year old halloffamer who used to be the head coach here in cincinnati sees his defense come up with the last stand to get the victory there s a lot of coverage on the outside you throw the ball into the slot receiver <person player="jordan shipley" race="UNK" position="WR">jordan shipley</person> the balls on his body and watch <person player="james harrison" race="nonwhite"

harrison" race="nonwhite" position="LB">james harrison</person> playing the way he s always played dislodges the balls from the rookie at the end of the game timeout taken here by cincinnati was 28 seconds left you know guys you see a wild finish happening here something the steelers had never seen happen almost blowing the 20 point lead and you watch dick lebeau walk out there with his arms raised do you know where it was 40 years ago today he was on the detroit lions team that had <person player="tom nelson" race="white" position="DB">tom</person> dempsey kick the longest field goal in nfl history 63 yards at the gun to beat him i think laveau s been a part of the nfl that long he was a player for those lions teams now he s done a great job over the years as the pittsburgh defensive
