look at the starting lineups for the kentucky wildcats to john calipari ulis murray briscoe in the backcourt poythress and willis upfront one change in the tennessee line of <person player="kyle phillips" race="UNK" position="DL">kyle</person> alexander in robert hubbs not starling tonight butter blackmun more and schofield round things off for rick barnes when alexander starting gives them their tallest player out of the floor at six foot nine the freshman coming up to his <person player="blake best" race="UNK" position="LS">best</person> game to see rebounds and six block shots they feel like theyve got to be able to protect the paint cutter and hux has been struggling officials car passes got it in hand ron weiser and keith in though john that s kentucky into the frontcourt were a the leading scorer with kentucky over 17 a game boys miss the kickout way overhead of units rick barnes his first year here in knoxville but his 29th season overall and many of those years 20 plus wins on the other side john calipari 7 years in lexington 12 and 5 against tennessee hundred and 16 years here s a <person player="colton jumper" race="UNK" position="LB">jumper</person> on the elbow will go for bachman ulis the biggest key for tennessee s theyre gonna have to get back and force kentucky to play in the half court set they got to take them out of their transition and then collapse on the paint briscoe gave up an open look ulis trying to penetrate get to that learners going to take it three for openers that ones off the ball tennessee at a hand on the rebound but schofield lost it out of bounds the communication has to be better for tennessee going after board but the one thing youd like if youre rick barnes is the fact there were no blue jerseys around that as far as getting an offensive rebound and putback fresh shot clock for kentucky the screen and cut against it pointless loose ball off scofield he s got the birch basket good job being active underneath armani moore is got to snatch that down he s got it in the old man s you cant allow it to get poked away kentucky one of the better offensive rebounding teams in the country it s amazing the amount of coaches weve talked about or talked with i should say in the last two or three weeks about some of the foul calls like last week we had what 79 freethrows or something like that on super tuesday 55 79 free throws in that georgia lsu game right now the officials think that there may be coaches think that the officials are calling the games a little bit differently season third curl cut for armani moore who has struggled a little bit here in recent games talked about over 23 games go field mister three that s probably not his shot to be on point was last time kentucky came off a loss thing with arkansas and they they took it to the razorbacks and they controlled that game really from start to finish and it was kind of like the turning point for a lot of is trending in the right direction where is kentucky going as a team now they take a loss and an emotional loss at <person player="josh allen" race="UNK" position="LB">allen</person> fieldhouse and the question persists is is they are they going to continue to take steps forward here s potter his <person player="colton jumper" race="UNK" position="LB">jumper</person> rims out and murray with a rebound nice job defensively by tennessee forcing the ball back on top to ulis he s going to take the three and fouled on the tree and when is gonna be on bachmann and itll send ulis to the freethrow line for three shots <person player="tyler byrd" race="UNK" position="WR">tyler</person> ulis has done an outstanding job of drawing fouls and getting to the freethrow line at that time the elevate the defender up he jumped into him you make the contact that s an easy one there s anybody in the conference you wanted the line he s it number one in the scc and freethrow shooting a shade under 88% when you think about <person player="tyler byrd" race="UNK" position="WR">tyler</person> ulis and you know weve talked about this we talk about it with coaches we talked about it with the players yeah the importance of what he means to kentucky basketball and his numbers in particular this year the growth that youve seen and obviously that comes with opportunity and minutes increase but there s so much asking them not just to be offensive im not just trying to make them facilitate the offense and be a leader but also the defensive end always initiating the attack and you take <person player="tyler byrd" race="UNK" position="WR">tyler</person> ulis off of kentucky s basketball team they get troubles theyre in a nightie basketball team i mean he is as valuable as an individual player that you find in college basketball and he continues to assert himself more and more knock down all three free throws and a three point lead he swore you allowed to bring out the pressure a little bit in front it turn tennessee over i just think <person player="tyler byrd" race="UNK" position="WR">tyler</person> ulis and his continued growth and yet sure there s <person player="chris westry" race="UNK" position="CB">chris</person> dunn and you know one finds an nba team my drafting <person player="chris westry" race="UNK" position="CB">chris</person> dunn before i take a look at <person player="tyler byrd" race="UNK" position="WR">tyler</person> ulis yeah size along six fourteen hundred and twenty plus pounds but theyre different categories the shoe around today we were living at <person player="tyler byrd" race="UNK" position="WR">tyler</person> and listed at five nine and he may be that but he might only be about a hundred fifty pounds to and that s soaking wet but tough is this nice move by marlon war didnt finish it though in the rebound kentucky s briscoe the outlet the ulis got a man to his right the line is too deep kentucky and a transition opportunity there and when it slip away is the first opportunity for kentucky to get out on the open floor and were on unable to finish and they got to try to speed up this game right now i think the tempos a little slower ulis four three now we just mentioned he does everything and he s already got six points that s the lead for kentucky six over the vols as he s got to settle inning it on their home court here get some good looks who did not start the game tonight because richland wasnt crazy about the way he played in the second half especially against tcu over the weekend there s a good look down low alexander missed madly trying to get it over marcus lee that started because of his footwork he was to narrow out his base got pushed off his line and that s a shot that he s going to be able to complete probably a year certainly two years from middles he starts to fill out a flock julis the lab underneath this time is going to be a file called as he tried to get it into marcus lee we started the game talking about the two guards kevin punter for tennessee and <person player="tyler byrd" race="UNK" position="WR">tyler</person> ulis has gotten off to a hot start he s number three he s wearing blue it s <person player="tyler byrd" race="UNK" position="WR">tyler</person> ulis is presented by hotelscom the obvious choice for hotels and in part by infiniti luxury cars that deliver

shannon spake he plays a whole lot of minutes five games a season he s played every single minute in course 45 minutes in the overtime loss to kansas saturday night he told me he felt pretty bad when he woke up sunday morning he was hurting hey coach john calipari really wants to start he said he would like to try to get him to about 34 minutes per game he said before the game you know he pat point guards in the past that he s played every minute of the game but because yulin plays so hard every possession he really wants to save him for what he need them yeah he encountered potter or two of the most used guards in the league as far as minutes playing the game because eula s get it inside to briscoe we had an open look on a three going to take the baseline <person player="colton jumper" race="UNK" position="LB">jumper</person> instead dara greece tennessee judgment that was eight shooting from the floor or to get things going and theyve got a free up kevin punter once the ball gets out of his hands theyve got to try to find a way to get him to be a more productive throw and he just gotten out of his hands right there on the drive his first basket marie does have to got the rebound coming from behind it s a whole bunch of traffic under the hoop on this one apartment well you sport one end and then youve got to be really cognizant to get back with your defensive transition in that time i ronnie moore they a little bit of a touch not a lot there but a good job scoring over the top and that s where kevin punter has got to be aggressive he cannot settle dispar threepoint shot as much as we talked about in the ocean shooting 56% at home in sec play he s got to assert himself and score going to the rim briscoe got two offensive rebounds in the second time he scored himself more on the drive a little floater tennessee his poydras with a left hand for her portraits can have a really good night tonight there s nobody on tennessee s roster that can match him with his size his physical stature if he wants to assert himself armani moore ill try three way off the mark and briscoe got another board first in his briscoe with his third rebound in the last 30 seconds and then in transition a perfect law just going from one end to the other briscoe does a nice job defensively nobody steps back it s the opportunity go for that one twist could act as a threepoint play tennessee s one of those things their roster it s theyre not going to get any talk and it s the smallest team bret <person player="greg hart" race="UNK" position="TE">hart</person> says he s ever had this year with the black shot just 36 this season stepping on the baseline kentucky turns it over it s really difficult though for rick barnes when youre looking at this roster and youre trying to figure out okay you know how do we match up what what what do i have to do to put my players in the <person player="blake best" race="UNK" position="LS">best</person> position to be successful it s part of the reason why they moved kevin punter to the point guard position ideally youd like to have them as a shooting guard but nobody else is better with the basketball in their hands armani moore gives you so much fighting so much stuff when he s only six four very difficult points again what you see from the tennessee is they space you out they look to attack they curl change up top and they just trying to turn the corner and create a seal or gap where they can get that midrange shot float over the top kentucky almost turned it over okay just a loose ball and nobody got out and then the big fella hammered at home the uptick in the kentucky season started when <person player="derek barnett" race="white" position="DE">derek</person> willis asserted himself at mississippi state game all the sudden who started being a little bit more aggressive now they took the loss he had a doubledouble and offer jump started him as a strut for and really opening up some spacing for a lot of the verbal drive action that kentucky does he s an excellent outside shooter as well effort plays can make a big difference and skal labissiere gets on the floor is it to <person player="derek barnett" race="white" position="DE">derek</person> willis he knows what to do with it the most of his opportunities lead from kentucky and now getting the word is uniform and playing such a significant role it s just one of those things that you in the fan base rallies behind but more importantly it means so much to bear yeah to represent the the name on the front of the jersey and to know that he s impacting the team s level of success last five games he s averaged 11 points and eight rebounds over eight rebounds in fact hey sean said kentucky day without a mount washington that s by eight years we approached the 12 better far let s go nice pass to poythress hats tryptone but theyre gonna call a foul i think on schofield let s see you got a hand in there nope that back is gonna be on reese the run by barry grease picks up the pop foul starting to stack up a little bit right now for tennessee and not a deep roster for rick barnes that he can go deep into and try to find guys it can be productive in a game like this seven points for exporters who is a tennessee native not a clarksville which is 11 three and a half hours from here the other nashville got a boat shanty and it was a big week for alex poythress because his twin sister actually gave birth to a baby girl so it s uncle alex moving forward which he s gonna name the baby there s alex and alexis it s got to be something close he dyslexic like that if she s listening that s just my suggestion i always take your advice i always listen to you and sometimes with a player you need to take the advice of your head coach and for kevin potter that s exactly what he did to transition his game to the successful season that he s having so far for the balls we are in a war your mission does not exist from director steven spielberg slowly tom hanks nobody is safe bridge of spies get it on bluray and digital hd today to introduce the new infiniti qx50 we could have shown in on a winding mountain pass or somewhere even more cliche like a downtown street but what distinguishes the infiniti qx50 isnt where you can take it it s how you feel taking it there with generous cargo space extended second row legroom and coop like handling the new qx50 from infiniti least a new infiniti qx50 for 329 a month busier local infiniti retailer to bring you wendy s north pacific cod sandwich we send guys like this one boats like these and weather like this all the way up here for wild caught fish like this that we panko bread like this for a sandwich that s light crispy and crunchy which should make you and guys like this really happy here with one of the most improved players in all the sec and maybe college basketball kevin punter and you changed your shot it s been a focal point of our broadcast every time we cover you take us through where you were on the floor and how you went about this like i said never left this paint area i pretty much stayed here and work my way back and um you know i start off with a medicine ball using one hand you know right up and over you know pie a thousand a day thousand a day and you did it four hours a day working on this shot and you think youd have this much success when you change the shot you know i worked hard every single day but my current really seated you know that far down the road i just wanted to continue to improve everyday he s improved his play his percentages his points per game he s happy about it you know he s not the opponents cuz now they got to deal with him every night or any age it s like being a golfer and changing your swing and they say it takes like a hundred thousand reps to get there when i spoke with kevin he said it was like literally breaking down everything he did as a child and you see the numbers the shooting percentages and where it s changed as well as points per game in 20 plus point games but it particularly told me there was a great deal of frustration there was nights where hed go to bed and say you know i dont know if i really want to do this this is hard because youre retraining muscle memory that youve done since the first time you picked up a basketball and it s really hard not to revert back to what your bad habits or your previous form was as willis on arena optimist briscoe gets run over two guys go down in transition it s just going to be a turnover yes shawn i knew you were going to talk about the shot i knew you would <person player="courtney love" race="UNK" position="LB">love</person> to hear more so i talked to kevin about it he told me starting in october is when this shot really started to feel like second nature he has no desire to revert back to the old way anymore in fact he told me he would watch kevin durant videos and try to duplicate that or try to mimic what he was doing and everything you said the release quicker no windup he said that feels like second nature now four to seven threes on the year fortyeight actually with the last one i didnt shoot the ball like you used to because no i dont remember how to do it even the shots inside drop down to the box coaching the midway point and a half poitras that s just beautiful you get the ball down low you relocate out on the threepoint line you pass the ball back out as he drives the defense steps to you step guy go in one direction the pass going the other is tennessee that s their first turnover but it couldnt come at a worse time as theyre down 11 at the midway point of a half poythress is going to get a breather and a welldeserved one as he leaves with ten points already he s only averaging 10 so in the first quarter of the game he s got as many points as he normally has over the course of an entire ballgame ulis gets it back to willis the three guy little track dribble across the top stretching the defense they have to be accountable for <person player="tyler byrd" race="UNK" position="WR">tyler</person> ulis but in doing so that s the difference that <person player="derek barnett" race="white" position="DE">derek</person> willis makes for this kentucky wildcat offense well as shoots 41% from out there and back to that turnovers by the volunteers it s a 14point game after that last three quarter the on ball screen comes the defense builds over the top and if you stay too long with <person player="tyler byrd" race="UNK" position="WR">tyler</person> ulis it s opening up your teammate on the outside speak it open it up right now is kentucky open it up on the balls during last year s super bowl an estimated 1 billion chicken wings were consumed 100 million pounds of avocados and a gazillion deli platters this year the game is changing good morning super bowl 50 all day breakfast is here weve gotten all hoops wednesday to vaughn at espn espn2 with a twist for you work off the crossover our collagen on just jump to the nba the nba guys go back to college jeff van gundy is gonna be with dick bite south on notre dame miami jay bilas and doug collins the lawyers in the wizards you see the other guys john barry fran fraschilla jay williams mark jackson that s tomorrow night espn espn2 another crossover night for you crossover pat still willis to mister three reminds me my former college team april watson tonight interim head coach his first game as head coach of the suns they go against the raptors ball hill kentucky wildcats on that son s roster down in phoenix you already talked to him today dont ending on scofield so wave off the basket couple turnovers an offensive goaltending and not a recipe for success for tennessee and jamal murray hasnt even scored for kentucky yet and theyve got a 14point lead he s their leading scorer and almost seventeen and a half of games still hasnt scored that one rimmed out kentucky he stepped on the baseline rick barnes head coach of tennessee wired tonight s traffic you gotta finish those shots man that trouble finishing their shots so far as we kentucky and half court says we lengthen their strength it s gonna hurt tennessee great ball movement by kentucky and there s murray s first basket got it to their <person player="blake best" race="UNK" position="LS">best</person> threepoint shooter and he knocks down a three we were talking earlier today shannon and i as well as you were saying you know what it s gonna be see how kentucky responds emotional game in lord s coming on the road against tennessee how would this team play early in the first half spotting when we came into the shoot around the first thing i was going to ask john calipari is you played so well against a highly ranked team in one of the toughest environments in college basketball do you feel like you got something money we didnt even have to ask the question he said no no moral victories if that s what youre gonna ask me it s like he knew what we were gonna say and after he looked at the film he still wasnt happy but he said i watched it by myself i didnt want to chew them out because theyre emotionally kind of immature right now at this point after coming off the loss sill he said i just watched it and then passed a few tips along to him and he was very actually conservative at the shooter run today as far those players and it s whatever whatever he s got going it s working right now 28:13 to my stella here s an open look for potter finally impressed with the ball movement and man movement against his own i think so often when you see a team attack a zone defense theyre stagnant they stand still once the ball passes out of their hands but what s impressed me is as the ball leaves the hands of one kentucky player theyre moving relocating to another spot nice pick and roll the poythress as ulis <person player="drew barker" race="UNK" position="QB">drew</person> a doubleteam and found number 22 for his 12 point keep bringing that doubleteam <person player="tyler byrd" race="UNK" position="WR">tyler</person> ulis is gonna hurt you he found <person player="derek

wondered where ben simmons went late in that hand against oklahoma watch what he does here this is ben simmons at his very <person player="blake best" race="UNK" position="LS">best</person> when he rebounds them on the defensive end and pushes the ball must be in his hands probably should be this guy s hands too he s got 17 points in eight in the first half buddy hield he hasnt started this game yet he has 17 points already that s not news guys look at this dna s coming into tonight lsu at 6 and 2 just a game off the pace same with kentucky i am at seven and one tennessee just try to work their way back in this kentucky s hit their last seven shots to stretch this lead after 17 really surprised down the stretch against oklahoma in the final of 448 ben simmons does not get one shot not one and to me that just it blows my mind and it was discussed by brent and dick during the end of that game there s a bolt an opportunity to may have a statement win on your home floor they were control of that game and they let slip away without playing through their <person player="blake best" race="UNK" position="LS">best</person> players on tennessee is going to be unblocked minh will be his second a little bit better efficiency from alex poythress than the tennessee volunteers i mean alex poythress has served himself in this game and as i mentioned the opportunity is there for him to have a huge game tonight he s habited so far so is this guy he s been the rest of the offense for the most part with seven <person player="tyler byrd" race="UNK" position="WR">tyler</person> ulis and that goes with three assists already in this game and the assist to made field goal ratio really strong for kentucky their ball movement as weve talked about already in this broadcast extremely crisp eight assists on 11 may trouble time i got a both 5 for 5 from the line lead goes out to 19 where s the offense gonna come from for tennessee to be a file on dominique hawkins with 629 or bathing in the half saturday we got a couple of good acc matches for yet espn two oclock eastern our first game north carolina state and duke then at 7:00 number two north carolina tar heels taking on notre dame also streaming live on watch espn and the espn app duke in desperate need of a wind having fallen out of the top 25 for the first time in 100 years and tennessee turns it over it s been that time of year though the higher ranked team last night in all three games loss smu lost to houston north carolina lost baylor lost at home to texas like a smart team rule is starting to to find their own place ebay have been punched in the last couple of games after us this one s not my putter so 3d shoot for kentucky you talk about scoring points and limited as far as point production goes you need guys like armani moore to step up brisco up and under just before the horn scented nice move by brisco he s had an excellent first half also if youre tennessee kind of want to get some stops yeah you would the way things are going when you shoot 24% and butters filed by portress that s point through a second little things execution sideline out of bounds <person player="tyler byrd" race="UNK" position="WR">tyler</person> ulis actually falling to the ground helped his teammate out a nice curl cut the defense had to kind of hop over in isaiah briscoe able to complete the play but where s the rotation from the helps i have some nice basketball savvy by a freshman though you dont got three seconds on the shot bock he kind of thinking im gonna touch it im gonna just hoist it and he went through traffic and took his time and made a reverse layup pretty good move i think it s you know it s what was seen you got three seconds you figure there s three dribbles that you can have yeah if youve been experienced in those situations and with this much basketball that is played not only at the high school level but obviously on the these guys have been in that situation time and time again ulis looking for his dreams finally got it the second time fucking s on a running car with a we go straight up with it that s a first type of transition theyve gotten a decent look at a tree stella verity the threepoint shot has gotta start becoming a major part of tennessee s arsenal tonight and they have to hit at a much better clip from the house so it s off most of coasts for more and kicks it out threw it away wasted opportunity theyre better served at that point as deep as he was to go up even though there were three kentucky wildcats around him youve got to use your shoulders and strengthener marni moore has to finish over the top he anticipated his teammate relocating and instead he was watching marie let her try to pick him up leaves with us out there again this guy s been at offensive rebounding machine under there didnt score on the last time we pulled it down but nonetheless for his size he s doing yeoman s work down on the boards in three offensive rebounds already for briscoe six total that kind of effort though youre looking for youre wanting to see if youre a kentucky wildcat fans willis as ultron you could tell by the way he set his feet but that one had no chance going and his body balance was completely off chance for a threepoint play when we return a little bit of a move here by the volunteers they cut the lay that of fourteen just under four

to get to 13 on the free throw up coming from kevin punter who by the way in the last six games now is 34 of his last 37 from the line to make pretty good amazing to think of the year that he s had and he has not been named sissies got 10 points right now least the student section is trying to get enjoy here thompson bullet worried drive the baseline knocked away as the stop tennessee was looking for and a putter a pullup over frisco we got five on the shot wow hess is right there and let s see if it s gonna be three free throws about im not quite sure if he was outside or inside alive on the drive inside the arc a little veteran savvy here briscoe puts his hand right between the shooting pocket and as he released the ball he pulled his arm back kevin punter did forcing briscoes hand into the content so you dont think i should have been a father i think it should be a foul it s it s just it s just a savvy move it s like playing out in the front yard with your with your dad you know and youre trying to score against your dad your dad hooked you a little bit and let go that s a 101 you know yeah there s contact you kind of initiated it but it works 10 oh tennessee run that was a cop i just said okay dont get a big head we got to keep working at this thing yes we do he s gotten a lot better though in the last couple minutes the scofield picks up ill do auburn stretch for frank <person player="justin martin" race="UNK" position="DB">martin</person> steam you know you look at their record and then everybody wants to say okay well look at who they played and propose at their resume an opportunity here at georgia then at texas a&amp;m lsu and then getting to host kentucky that is a brutal fourgame stretch we understand truck tellers now that georgia is up ten right to the first half of that game just under three to play here 13point kentucky lead that was 21 at one point six foot four inch brain to just about anybody in this conference you know he understands angles im not sure if he took geometry but he certainly knows it he puts himself on the block he gets you leaning one way and spins right off and marie s box partner let s take you back and teach you a little geometry here you try to create an angle so you make the contact watch as he shifts <person player="derek barnett" race="white" position="DE">derek</person> willis his weight off of him spins off creates enough space and when youre small in stature and youve got good strong shoulders up a body strength that s the one way that you can neutralise size and athleticism he leads the team in block shots he s seventh in the conference in rebounding and just for instance has marine axe down the free throw just the line in a loss to tcu the other day gives you an idea bottom on anymore ten points seven rebounds six assists and three steals i mean he works hard at it and as you mentioned plane out of position and any fair to say it last two years he has been forced and asked to do things that at six foot four you shouldnt have to be two minutes ago scofield on orion and he s going to go to the freethrow line well what tennessee s done is is what they showed snippets off early in this game is space the floor nobody needs to post up youre not going to score really with your back to the basket he not only a marnie more shot he caught the ball off the short corner and then bounced his way in if youre just playing with your back to the basket youre clogging up driving lengths and what youve seen tennessee start to do is space the floor and look to drive an attack once theyre a seen theyre being patient right now offensively scofield s done a nice job from the line 18 out of 20 on the year naked 19 and 21 all four of his points from the stripe and were back down to 11 again just under two minutes ulis nice crossover dribble he puts up a runner those blocks and <person player="tyler byrd" race="UNK" position="WR">tyler</person> ulis is grabbing his left foot he is still down on the floor and just now starting to make his way back trying to limp back it s a fine for <person player="tyler byrd" race="UNK" position="WR">tyler</person> ulis is immediately retile his left shoe but he was hobbling down court because she wasnt tired he s limping a good job by tennessee taking advantage to cross over by ulis as he elevates up that left foot as he tried to push off the ground buckled underneath him watch his left foot as he plants it right there his ankle turns out and that s what kept him down on the floor and that s what gave the fiveonfour advantage for tennessee timeout taken by kentucky leads down to me kevin punter has been a guy he needs to continue to be the galle averaging 23 points per game second <person player="blake best" race="UNK" position="LS">best</person> in the sec especially at home shooting threepoint shots he s willing to drive he can mix it up underneath kentucky has gone over four minutes without a field goal in tennessee meanwhile on a 17 to four run so it went from 34 13 21 point difference ulis is out there but he s got a little hitch in his giddyup twentyone point lead as we approach a minute to play in a half defensive intensity for the balls is really improved here in the next few trips that s gonna be on the willerson thatll be too small job that time by armani moore in transition you know who talked about the patience and spacing the floor that time they didnt need to have patience because there was a direct straight line drive available good job absorbing the contact on his hip and earning the trip to the freethrow line one thing that our body is not strong at and i mentioned everything that he is strong it free throw lines not the greatest 58% on the year that s down actually from sixty to a year ago but i like what he makes me look bad now to seven how important was he last year to this team he started all 32 games led the team in total rebounding offensive rebound blocked shots at six foot four the leaves cut the 6/7 option you know straight drive for the little guy on the baseline okay theyre on that truck yeah it did that up and under wont go schofield brought down the rebound and he s fouled and rick barnes again wired tonight here on the home floor they are competing right now schofield back to the free throw line where he s hit five straight and he s not 20 out of 22 on the year which is about 89% built like a football player you might say his brother <person player="danny obrien" race="UNK" position="DL">obrien</person> skokie no those remember the atlanta falcons and a former seattle seahawk excuse you at the freethrow line does he think get this giving some packets next year signing day tomorrow second hed extend out to defense that that high against kentucky and especially a guard like <person player="tyler byrd" race="UNK" position="WR">tyler</person> ulis he s gonna make you pay he s gonna get pickup a jeep bow in really a nonoperational area seven for seven from the strike tonight for <person player="tyler byrd" race="UNK" position="WR">tyler</person> name this week as a finalist for the bob cousy award which goes to the top point guard in the country and certainly he belongs on that finalists list of 10 and talked about kevin punter not winning the sec player of the week honors <person player="tyler byrd" race="UNK" position="WR">tyler</person> ulis is one of two players in the conference to win it multiple times the other one jalen jones from texas a&amp;m good company 25 monni more one extra dribble underneath looks like he was going to go up with a shot and instead file on the baseline weve turned it into a freethrow shooting contest in the last couple seconds of final minute of this first half so right now for kentucky theyve got one two three four five guys that have two files and a c with three players with two and our money more back for he was a moment ago tennessee hasnt missed from the freethrow line still after 14 out of 14 with a lot of games that way top shooting freethrow team in the sec at 74% a game boy this will keep you in a lot of games and it will win you a lot of games from 15 feet away theyre perfect so far and a half we got 3/4 the same drop it 12 seconds now ulis kickout bush had it blocked on the baseline comeback by tennessee 42:36 kentucky s lead sliced down to a halfdozen shannon s with john calipari coach they pulled within six making score baskets but that means you got to be down you gotta fight for position you got to play in before they catch balls theyre doing a great job tennessee s playing what did <person player="tyler byrd" race="UNK" position="WR">tyler</person> tell you about his foot anything we saw him back out there but did he say anything about the foot when you first came down everything s fine except a 21point lead is down to six at the break here in knoxville 42:36 our time score time for the jeep halftime report <person player="carlin filsaime" race="UNK" position="RB">carlin</person> said standing behind the studio guys im brad thank you very much welcome to the halftime two calipari point mike goodness enough with fouls uncle on that lsu and auburn ben simmons but he had eight baskets in the first half youre gonna see all of himself ben simmons he posted up he shot jumpers he attacked the basket off the defensive rebounds he was aggressive they played through ben simmons if they do that theyre gonna be the conversation for the nc doublea tournament big well to see that jump shot there he looks ambidextrous and for the magic johnson comparisons there you go right here this is the play offensive rebound he attacks youve got to stop the basketball if you had a fighting bruce pearls albarn didnt he gets to the rim he goes lefthanded he goes righthanded here we go with the right hand and then the last one youll see is this sort of foul line extended jump shot which a lot of people it s like a football team that doesnt run you got to do it once in a while and he committed to that shot he didnt aim and he jumped up and he committed to it much so youve seen that in his game before tonight were seeing a little bit more of it you got to trust himself believe in himself and he has room and rhythm step into it jump up and shoot it hey the worst thing it could happen so you mrs johnson you think this is a result of the oklahoma game just a reminder working on it what led to that to me this is jim johnny jones bringing him into the office say you know what were gonna make a run for the ncaa tournament you need to be aggressive and you know the rest of your teammates they need to play through you the ball has to be in your hands right and dont worry about it be aggressive attack make plays look youre not a selfish guy look to attack and make plenty a little that s what he day be a little bit meantime our game and cal made the point were fouling on every possession you got to play a little bit better defense is it is it more on the team or is this about the game right now easy early alex poythress goes out and you know john we talked yesterday he said he s really struggling finding rotation because the inconsistency things came so easy early that guys stopped competing they stopped sharing the ball to stop running offense with good pace and then the defensive end all right you cant guard unless you move your feet sit down in the stance and guard someone all right let s hope to that the ankle which did get rolled doesnt necessarily swell up during the halftime break south carolina and georgia talking about <person player="tyler byrd" race="UNK" position="WR">tyler</person> ulis his ankle georgia with an early lead off the picks up an eye right back on you know what give it a meh record they want four of us is that what youre suggesting well take this georgia team has potential to me the key is the back the back let s gotta remain progressive charles mann jj frazier and theyre aggressive theyre good any game by the way great lefthanded the layup from seth we just saw that was terrific well be back super tuesday look ahead to michigan

to espn games one on espn2 at 9:00 the other one indiana and michigan at espn two teams that have overcome big injuries this year and both have been able to do it with scoring yogi ferrell has been tremendous and meantime michigan without karras levert you figure were in trouble they have been bombs away all year both of these teams make over ten threes a game and michigan does a great job of pushing in transition and also in halfcourt they spread you out they drive it they kick it and they can make shots right here off of this loose ball look how hard they run abdulrahman right here he s gonna run the court and he s gonna run it wide that s the key if youre gonna push it in transition you got to run it wide there s a curve and he s gonna run it with the basketball derrek walters gonna look to push that basketball and attack theyre gonna come at you in waves and once they kick it ahead youre gonna see four players outside the threepoint line let that fourth player duncan robinson is one of the <person player="blake best" race="UNK" position="LS">best</person> shooters in the country he s going to come behind the play step in and knock down his three 41% of their offense comes from the threepoint line but in the half court theyre gonna look to space you out once again on this down screen right here this is a curve and set the down screen but mark tinnell he s gonna back up this screen which is gonna create a big gap once again it s about spacing in michigan they space out the floor youre gonna have four players once again outside the threepoint line so what does dirk walton do he s gonna drive this gap and make a play as he drives it watch what happens here duncan robinson is gonna spot up come behind the play and once again knock down the three he was a division three transfer from williams one of the <person player="blake best" race="UNK" position="LS">best</person> shooters in college basketball they shoot over 41% from the threepoint line they push it they execute in halfcourt and they can really shoot the three but both of those highlights were against rutgers in minnesota indiana s defense has been better and maybe this is a thomas bryan game maybe indiana goes inside a little bit well they need to attack inside because marc donnell he they do not have a rim protector in michigan brian it s one of the <person player="blake best" race="UNK" position="LS">best</person> field goal presented she was in college basket i all right meantime are a game on espn2 a couple of teams coming off of losses with west virginia and iowa state off losses seth is this going to be an advantage because it s just a home game for iowa state by outofstate help magic is for real and you know iowa state has the type of team that can handle the basketball and

bat vistaprintcom youre watching super tuesday for examined by hotelscom back at knoxville at c sec on espn tennessee and kentucky just about set to go to the second half 42 36 the wildcats in front tennessee perfect from the freethrow line kentucky s only missed one and both teams had a couple of few little drops but good first half really shawn and alex poythress they worked well together they were aggressive they got into the paint theyre unselfish and he broke out of the shooting early on here and what really stands out to me is the level of competitiveness i think tennessee elevated their play they were down by 20 but the light flipped on it started the defensive end being able to string together some stops there s 34 to 13 at one point to cut it down to six at halftime youve got to click the momentum is definitely with tennessee now keep in mind they had a 14point lead against tcu last weekend and they let that one slip away i think the first four minutes to the second half is going to tell us a tale about takes it back this time and bachmann puts it in overdrive well coach cal kerry talked about the free throws not needing to foul and send him to the freethrow line i think that s what really disrupted the flow of this game was the number of free throws that we saw down the stretch check in with shannon as poythress scores underneath well that s a toughness that rick barnes really liked out of his guys at that first half close he said you know what i saw some competitiveness out of them and of course we heard him challenge his guys when he was over there on the bench he did tell me we gave up too many offensive rebounds and he said offensively i dont want them to overthink it at times i felt like they were trying to run the offense rather than just play him i think well see more threepoint shots from tennessee in the second half than we did in the first is poythress cant connect on the threepoint play he does have 14 on the night though i think you continue to try to get the ball for us as i mentioned the first half there s nobody on the floor the connection is / with us stoked we will try to keep it alive and he draws the foul and it s gonna be on purpose and that s three on him you mentioned it five kentucky wildcats with two fouls in the first half rick barnes starts the second half with my stella before the only change from the starting lineup and quickly john calipari is with a sick point first up after that third pilot marcus lee back in there that leaves plant with two as well before points kentucky s lee they just tossed kevin punter his shoe but <person player="tyler byrd" race="UNK" position="WR">tyler</person> ulis got out of position came up too high and created that lane and that opportunity hunter knows he lost his shoe so what do you do with it hey i lost my shoe just toss it out about to go play some defense but that was poor recognition that time for tally was he got on the high side away from the basket gave up that leg if you lose a shoe in lexington they sent you it to the blacksmith he s a little different here in tennessee here s marie got it to drop the tough first down for marie just 1 of 6 from the field and i stopped seeing him attack off the perimeter settled oh taro is 17 the leads down to three murray with the answer all the other not a lot of space and a year ago we we showed you the first half how he s adjusted his shot a year ago there s no way that shot gets off because it took so long for his release last season a quicker release gets it right over the top of the fingertips of <person player="derek barnett" race="white" position="DE">derek</person> willis two minutes into that opening four minutes i talked about and the leads been cut in half so tennessee s got the better of it in the opening couple of minutes seven on the shot clock lorry and traffic let s go up there at least two times now lately shop constant risk has been able to finish how quickly does the game change right there youre knocking on the door you put good defense and you give up a layup late in the shot clock a quick turnover leads to another run out the other end let s go for you three 17 3/4 of the year for admiral scofield marie fade away from the elbow nice shot now it starts to spiral and really gets going he s got six to the half 11 for the day stella first one but he s fouled briscoe jamal murray just one of six in the first half he comes out of the locker room and starts impressively attacking this was off the steal that was after isaiah briscoe wrapped it around the underneath when the game was down to three and then the savvy footwork right there the balance that he has underneath to push ever so slightly back and fade away on that shot creating the space to finish up over the top here s detrick mostella the sophomore or the caterer alabama at the freethrow line and tennessee still hasnt missed from the stripe first to go from on stella marcus lee goes out the busy air comes back in for kentucky mostella has a standing birth of over 33 inches to the freethrow line there s three from the strike that s it back to three willis his triple to strive through that testing

his brother brent went to oregon state and andrew who followed or due to georgia tech they briscoe on the bench for personal fouls we still have a perfect night going 2424 tennessee from the freethrow line check in with shannon you know john calipari said before the game one of the things is if he wanted his team to lose in that kansas loss was that we gave one away and theyve been talking a lot about winning basketball within this organization and he just told his guys in the huddle listen we put these out a threepoint shooter and weve missed some rebounds that is not it is winning basketball though is she s trying to spoil him to paint 10 their 12 second half points have come in the paint for the kentucky wildcats that s where they need to continue to look to attack tennessee the second in the conference and points of thirtysix humor in the back more with a rebound he was sitting on he should have spun back baseline without a clean look off the glass burrow screen 54:53

on the catch he s going to drive into this area and what you need to watch is <person player="tyler byrd" race="UNK" position="WR">tyler</person> ulis because he is going to float out into this direction and drift and when he does that he s going to leave a wideopen threepoint shot from the outside by mustela a seat ulis just turns his back to his man loses vision a nice job driving and then kicking out to the shooter mostella at least one threepointer in the last 13 straight games and the big one a moment given tennessee their first lead poythress lost the handle going up back though to

pushing in transition to defense defense insideout bam you can see his act on espnews soon on espn yogi ferrell indiana playing a lot better right now against the michigan team set on shooting freeze bradshaw here it s a twopoint game kentucky led by six at halftime tennessee actually took a lead of 56 54 both teams have really warmed up in the second half kentucky shoots 69 percent from the floor tennessee 57 right now every pass is kicked crowd here has been outstanding in its split i mean when kentucky ran on the floor tonight you heard a lot of applause and then also they brought the booze out from the tennessee faithful state blue nation chant was just going on coming out of that timeout ulis really kind of offbalance and out of control but he did draw a foul as we check in last timeout with rick barnes wired play harder on the defensive end all right play harder compete does al kathina every possession on that end we take care of the defensive end i told you they know we know we will explode on offense right somebody this is a free throw at our ulis just did third time kentucky s mr freethrow the first after <person player="tyler byrd" race="UNK" position="WR">tyler</person> who is now 10 of 11 from the strike so it s cool calm and collected we step to the freethrow line this is one chuckles coughs making minions places go down to tower judas knows how to make winning plays at 16:30 only on the second tire tonight the first one is at twopiece i mentioned the lack of confidence in particular in this building armani moore doesnt want to shoot the shot and marcus lee backs off and finally goes you know what i havent made one in six games amma s well knock one down and that s his first made three now in seven games he turns it over summa kentucky snoring the efficiency of the 1414 marks at 10 of 21 it s dropped a little bit there theyve led by 21 but it s been tennessee that has picked up the floor spacing and execution spaced out before is there s nobody in the paint try to regain here with eight of the shot clock fire has a look part of the screen mr sheree though boy was made a run at him was not a clean look and will go back to kentucky good defense that time by kentucky they were there they didnt allow any separation they didnt reach in briscoe picked up a cheap foul oil in the hackle he brought it on down they keepin it straight up ulis from the freethrow line so pointless know it before it is and it is or on poydras 10:07 mark he s got to come out that probably wouldve happened if marcus lee had just done his job on that possession had the opportunity to bring the rebound in strong and instead got it deflected out of his hands and when tennessee got it alex poythress was in poor position picked up the foul there s some fullcourt pressure for the first time from kentucky ulis has made jet motors night miserable with that be fixed right his chest for the shot clock based on super goes for hugs which tennessee back and foot murray the rebound tennessee in transition willis knocks it out of bounds or it might have been a breakaway well you dont have troop back to the basket players you post up off the block you create space and you try to force the defensive player to shift their weight and allow you to step back or create space to finish over the top and that s what hugs was able to do let us see second lead of this half war a little skip pass inside i got booted out of their poor angle that time though for our monte morris got a tribble and create a better angle after bush you get an indiana stick around for sports center at night and to john s will be along big night the nhl back in action sports center a night tonight after college hoops right here on espn extremely live on watch espn espn app it s the mvp schofield the trip easiest rebound of the night look what i found coach calipari talks about this every time on bennett practice you got a pass with two hands and you got a rebound with two hands that time where we try to go with one that s why he was unable to corral the ball in for the elbow we battle he briscoe so he had a lot of them early in the first half ulis gave up the three murray as tennessee s said body <person player="kyle phillips" race="UNK" position="DL">phillips</person> approaching the 8minute mark great possession that time for kentucky they got a very clean look theyre just not knocking down the shot philips didnt see somebody blew an assignment there and kevin connor was standing alone in the lane just saying hey how about me well send copies to the freethrow line you mentioned kevin punter was wide open watch as he comes off the screen the communication right here they dont talk themselves through it and they missed an opportunity to get an easy one underneath you saw what ill use make contact he was pointing and jamal murray looked back and said where to go there s the first missed freethrow that happens sometimes we got a 21 right now now you look at the score where it s at two point lead for tennessee there s eight minutes left to go in this game and there s already seven personal fouls where has tennessee found its easiest scoring opportunities right where theyre at right now so you got to keep driving you got to keep attacking if youre tennessee trying to get into the body of kentucky players the second to biggest lead of the night for the volunteers ulis is on the bench because weve got a tv time john calipari were to give a little extra breeder before that next whistle though to see how much time he does get miss <person player="colton jumper" race="UNK" position="LB">jumper</person> more with a rebound tennessee bringing it down with a threepoint cushion one of these tests he s done a better job of is trying to limit the second chance point opportunities for kentucky a lot of one shots and then done for the wildcats here in the second half kentucky leads the conference in secondchance points just under 15 a game briscoe the kickout to hawkins he missed a three ball hits the deck got money more with a loose ball risto was in position but remember he s got four personal fouls he bailed out it s to tennessee as you saw kentucky s over five minutes without a few go boy do they need one right now five marie trying to give him a triple you shot by jamal murray why s everybody down to stuff back here back tennessee s in a nice job aggressively attacking and especially here in the second half against kentucky they got me defensive rebound in the open floor briscoe position bails out <person player="kyle phillips" race="UNK" position="DL">phillips</person> able to finish espn s exclusive presentation of college basketball is presented by cocacola and in part by

lebowski farkle and true grit allstar movie of the year but seriously hail caesar rated pg13 ever since fans boling arena they leave by two in a series that goes all the way back 116 years kentucky has won two the last nine first meeting between john calipari and rick barnes at scc coaches but they had faced each other for time both teams and both coaches are gonna remember this one when it s over regardless of who wins or loses it has turned into a great game and it certainly wasnt in the first half if youre tennessee and tennessee in the bonus chosen one continue to want to be aggressive attack good a freethrow shooter is there is no shot five to shoot more is gonna have to take it on ulis it is what that was with the shot clock that know about three you was underneath than not a lot there there s not a lot there yeah there s contact but that s posted up the first part of the wild for kevin quarter an 82% freethrow shooter who s 6 for 6 from the line tonight makes 20 points from the 16th time this season for kevin punter averaging 24 in league games 23 over to father on the other end that s gonna be on philips that s his fourth the book teams are finding themselves with a little bit of file issues right now through the players out on the floor for kentucky poythress in brisco both with four personal fouls both are starters well be marie to inbound with a fresh shot clock for the wildcats he gets it right back and goes straight up with a three boy <person player="chris westry" race="UNK" position="CB">chris</person> keeps it alive for you listen it s briscoe going to the rack he <person player="drew barker" race="UNK" position="QB">drew</person> a file and theyre in the pollack because it he went off the glass first briscoe nice job driving in and as he drives in the ball hits the glass first so once the ball is hit the glass youve got allowed to let go that didnt happen that s why they count the basket and it s opportunity for a threepoint play to go at the freethrow line his previous two games he s shooting 61% from the freethrow line overall though not so much the previous six games before that just 21% so no but he is much improved in the last two games from the freethrow line missed that one strangled for the loose ball we start the game but he s been a big contributor here five minutes or so and i ulis with a steal with the fire <person player="tyler byrd" race="UNK" position="WR">tyler</person> ulis once again being posted up down low on the block youre gonna see him in this portion of your screen watch the way he comes out and cheats so he s fighting for position underneath very similar to that previous possession and on the pass he released his contact and is able to play the passing lane and then draw the foul to get to the free throw line where he s almost automatic 19 points for <person player="tyler byrd" race="UNK" position="WR">tyler</person> schofield comes back again both good straight game for <person player="tyler byrd" race="UNK" position="WR">tyler</person> ulis to go over 20 points it s his 10th overall on the season and to see almost straight away again marcus leeeeee as he swats the ball and the shooters arms halfway into the stands they extend all the way out defensively as it was that near turnover at midcourt and actually benefited tennessee because of how much it opened up the floor the officials over there at the scorer s table on the drive it s a hard foul honestly that s that s a good foul you just raked him across the arms that s what youre supposed to do on a truck no contact mate to the head youre not dealing you rotate over defensively and you play that a little bit better considering where that drive started but outside of that i mean that s just that s just a good basketball foul to make sure that the player doesnt get an opportunity for a threepoint play and ill have to earn it at the freethrow line two shots given up officials carl hester on gruber keith kimball had a little conference over there and said basically what sean said just a hard foul free throw line dont up hobbes is the only volunteer to miss a free throw tonight one for two for the stripe right now locked in our third tie the game waitress comes back in playing with four fouls marcus lee goes out he mentioned his struggles against tcu just one of seven from the field two points four thousand twenty one minutes at the second of two tennessee by walk his point was going to face line against scofield locked it out of our it s exactly where they wanted to get the ball down low down spoilers to rip through and he just lost control of the ball and dribbled it right off of his name stunting frustration from coach calipari again theyre going to try a little back court pressure didnt seem to affect him to see the last time but now theyve got the guys hands that they want in fire youre going to take it to the restaurant laughs into the pink back to that kentucky turnovers at

has fouled out of my lawyer will go to the preacher line where he is six for six and with that foul tennessee goes in the double bonus which means they will shoot to the rest of the way anytime there s contact for the senior out of campus or over 18 points 10 rebounds that s his third doubledouble of the season second one off the bhaktas murray pulled down to this 77 17 looseball tennessee hustle sport and they were on the baseline but great individual effort by schofield on their to try to save it selling out for the ball selling out to try to gain possession of the basketball when you have a sevenpoint lead that s the scratching the clawing that tennessee has done for majority the second half early to start the second half they didnt great job kentucky didnt getting points in the paint 10 now their first 12 points in the second half came in the paint then they hit those backtoback threes to answer the first original lead for tennessee they have not gotten many looks though in transition everything s had to be in their halfcourt set road and tennessee has done a superb job of packing in the pink refreshment calmly knocks down the first free throw 17 for jamal which is on his average 174 coming in which is 5th to the conference im just afraid over hos average ebay hits this one does 18 we down to five with three to go didnt get the baseline <person player="colton jumper" race="UNK" position="LB">jumper</person> or the willis got burrito see defensively goat awareness and good transition at time for tennessee there goes peel off the glass games hunters aliens with a <person player="colton jumper" race="UNK" position="LB">jumper</person> good positioning on the way back for willis ulis leaves it for brisco with a left hand in and out the tip back in by lee at first basket per marcus lee a beautiful dropoff past by tomorrow marcus leeeeee that time did what he didnt do about three minutes ago let s get the offensive rebound security and be able to finish him tennessee takes a timeout <person player="tyler byrd" race="UNK" position="WR">tyler</person> ulis attacking in the open floor turns the corner the defense pinches in a good look for briscoe unable to finish with a nice job by marcus lee to be active on the glass now were in the scc here in game one at super tuesday were gonna go to the acc on saturday 2 oclock eastern north carolina state and duke will square off then at 7 oclock brice johnson number 2 north carolina s taking on notre dame also streaming live on watchespn and the espn app brad nessler sean farnham shannon speaking our espn crew here on super tuesday in knoxville tennessee at thompsonboling arena kentucky coming off a loss in overtime to kansas tennessee coming off a disappointing one against tcu in the big 12 sec challenge when they led by 14 at halftime tonight they were down 21 in the first half cut it to 6 by the break and it led by as many as 7 here in the second half see there that was gets a rick barnes texas team trying to be on the other end of it what it was 21 i mean everything was moving we talked about what we wanted to see out of kentucky as far as the mental strength and focus coming out the gates here on the road they showed an early but youve got a credit tennessee and their competitiveness and it s what reforms have been challenging his team on all night long every time we do a wired senate is he talking about specific place is he talking about putting somebody in the right position on the floor or saying guys you just have to compete turn it up turn it up keep going keep going because that s where theyve they dropped off on their game on saturday against tcu they put it in cruise control in the second half they failed to score and they allowed tcu to find a rhythm that time out i hope kentucky doesnt fly this is let s go rejected back marcus leeeeee with 11 on the shot clock in 134 to go great job rotating over from the help side position willis did an excellent job not reaching his arms in and that s what a lot of the time for marcus lee the rotate over and finish to get it to blow away hugs by the priests 79 74 ulis crowd away this is the gun you gotta watch he s right there and jamal murray gets caught looking at the ball when you look at the ball you lose sight of your man and when you lose sight of your man that s what happened you give up too kentucky has broken down at the defensive end before we showed you on the three by mostella were <person player="tyler byrd" race="UNK" position="WR">tyler</person> ulis lost him because he was watching the ball at that time tomorrow murray he turned and watched the ball and <person player="tyler byrd" race="UNK" position="WR">tyler</person> ulis misses his second creature they desperately needed it lead remains five for tennessee comes a doubleteam on <person player="tj carter" race="UNK" position="DE">carter</person> gets it down in this corner spoke to ago string up with it just epic like wanting the baltimore tracking it down and he s got 12 rebounds none maybe bigger than that one calipari again says get some double teams out here clock is winding down beyond us the tension bowler can smell it the old tiny breakdowns didnt we seem down the stretch of this game marcus leeeeee a couple times that defensive rebound on that possession missing the offensive rebound wanted alex poythress tributed it off of his knee watching at the defensive end at least twice in the second half when you travel on the road in particular this year in college basketball this is not abnormal this has become the norm of what we see across the country butter missed a free grill but he gets another one there the double bonus he had been 7 for 7 from the line he is averaging 24 points per game and sec action which is where he is right now number 2 in the conference system finally as the overall scoring lead he got the second 125 that s a 6 point lead the cats unis to kick out during the corner by murray and it cuts the lead at halftime at kentucky great execution a called play from coach calipari that was set up the drive baseline the defense completely collapses and they leave jamal murray wide open from the outside as he hits the deck the ball hits the bottom of the net the <person player="tyler byrd" race="UNK" position="WR">tyler</person> ulis almost outofbounds look like he got rid of that pass as his foot was stepping on the baseline remember jamal murray just one of six in the first half second but that last threepoint shot that he had right there so huge and pivotal in his bunk the missed free throw by kevin punter opens up the door of opportunity it s down to three and now youre gonna look to steal immediately on the inbounds pass but if you dont you got to foul quickly elongate out this game if you heard all that noise it s because the replay the tennessee fans did not agree that <person player="tyler byrd" race="UNK" position="WR">tyler</person> ulis didnt step on the baseline before he delivered that pass as we get another look at it his right foot as the ball is leaving his hand it is out his foot is down it s a bangbang play his foot may not be down to that point we cant tell but it was that close it s as close as it comes but now youve got to be really aggressive here if youre kentucky youre gonna try to trap immediately get a deflection or steal if you can get the ball get to the ball first basically they dont have any bad freethrow shooters on the floor right now at least not tonight the way theyve been hitting shots so they immediately foul hubs he is the guy that s missed two of the four that they have this tonight so they play the percentages and that worked out born pretty well the defense for offense substitution remember briscoes got four fouls so he went to the bench matthews came in for hopkins came in for ulis robert hubbs didnt start the game tonight because of his performance against tcu he has come out and played with some serious intensity especially in the second half three out of five to the stripe still two possession game with less than 30 to go ulis bleeds it for all it s worth before he picks up the ball marie looking for a threewheeler set his hands on the rebound lee comes up with it now marie another one brisco and he missed three times kentucky with a chance fivepoint lead just under 10 to go as we check in with carl rabbits in the studio my great stuff there brad well watch the last nine seconds unfold in a moment want to remind everybody now on espn3 and soon to be seen right here on espn indiana and john beilein and michigan 2 2 they are underway so you can see it on espn 3 the conclusion of our game though kentucky and tennessee brad john back today everybody standing at thompsonboling arena may not have been a sellout tonight that if this lead holds about 22,000 people are going to say they were here this would be the biggest win in year one for rick barnes and it would snap a twogame winning streak in the series that goes back a long long ways this is a 219th time these two teams have gotten together that s the oldest rivalry or the oldest matchup in the southeastern conference itll be one little people will remember for a long time if indeed tennessee pulls off the upset here tennessee had lost eight out of its last nine meetings welldocumented kentucky struggles and true road games this year just two and four bodyboarding bath he hit his last two shots theyre going to have to foul somebody and they finally found a nor ulis has to do it with six seconds to go thatll be it for <person player="tyler byrd" race="UNK" position="WR">tyler</person> ulis itll be the second starter fallout for kentucky he leaves with 20 points and five assists it s about what his average is right now over the last six seven games <person player="gavin bryant" race="UNK" position="LB">gavin</person> potter now 25 points to the line to try to ice things got that one two possession game right now it wont be in a second iv it s this next free throw final seconds first game in the series is a hundred and sixteen years ago this friday
