stuffing the new england patriots <person player="kyle love" race="nonwhite" position="DT">love</person> the iformation in goal line situations they run the stretch play away from where they perceived the overload to be look at this bowl back as ben jarvis green alice s escort three dollars whose union long field goal attempt gave <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> and the patriots a shorter field and they walked down saint brad for the extra points two scores for new england bitch jarvis green ellis last ten games ten rushing touchdowns it s lead by 10 six plays the biggest was the 36 yard pass interference penalty on <person player="eric smith" race="white" position="DB">eric smith</person> of the jets and after the touchdown <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> and <person player="robert turner" race="white" position="OT">robert turner</person> jets offensive lineman who s in there on goal line with some words

for the year he bills the ravens then with the jets the eyes of the back of the defense for rex ryan and his replacement <person player="eric smith" race="white" position="DB">eric smith</person> who s getting everybody in the right position was doing a lot of that couldnt catch up with <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> therefore the passengers here

position="LB">shawn</person> green pull the dollhouse that you can hear the whistle blower see as the officials this market second down theyve blown the whistle some forward progress this breadsmith he comes into game their guns unbalanced line and they run an option play and a lot of these defenses do a great job of holding these backs up and going for the strip and you see the ball come out before he s down but forward progress not relating to a first down of the goal line is not reviewable 7:6 delay again guys talk to me about boys here because the jets were aggressive with their decisions first drive 10 nothing and now theyre back in you still have to maintain your composure in this situation though this crowd is valley it s noisy <person player="brian hoyer" race="nonwhite" position="QB">brian</person> shot numbers lettuce fish stay with the game plan no needle just yet second and 11 they rush for and completes us antonia hole decisiveness theyre just the simple crossing route by <person player="santonio holmes" race="nonwhite" position="WR">santonio holmes</person> looked like <person player="mark sanchez" race="white" position="QB">sanchez</person> thought <person player="santonio holmes" race="nonwhite" position="WR">holmes</person> was going to stay on the move the <person player="santonio holmes" race="nonwhite" position="WR">santonio</person> sat it down but this is an easy completion what happens when the missed four games joss are there <person player="john conner" race="UNK" position="RB">john</person> ever said you know somebody s got to sit there patriots pressure was five <person player="mark sanchez" race="white" position="QB">sanchez</person> hitches off the hands a home nearly taken away by di but jets go free it out it s the same route to crossing routes man to man too deep over the top and mark missed him again he got a wonderous <person player="mark sanchez" race="white" position="QB">sanchez</person> s feeling okay but they can look at it just the simple shallow cross balls got to be thrown a foot in front of the numbers so you can make something after the catch but those are two bad throws by <person player="mark sanchez" race="white" position="QB">mark sanchez</person> early in his game <person player="steve weatherford" race="white" position="P">steve weatherford</person> jenks with the wing and missed it off the side of his foot is going to pay to train right now elmo s on the other side that kid was a grand total of 13 yards of patriots and take over at the jets 33 ah god almost missed back in foxborough pat s take over at the 32 depression on play action and brought down by james it hit a bow back to the 45 but jets defense with a big play the loss of 13 my life that call by rex ryan right after a sudden change you get a bad punt home adams going against you you bring a fast defensive back off the edge he beats <person player="matt light" race="white" position="OT">matt light</person> clean big sacked by the jet defense that s just an athletic mismatch matt late knew he had to get out there but the head of boats is too quick got on <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> better both played his college ball about 95 miles from here umass officially a loss of 12 it s lining up for pressure with time nez broken up by smith and incomplete bigtime now these jets defense this is their calling card and so is pressure on third and long they need to keep the patriots off the board on this truck and pressure is the name of the game for the jets defense they blitz 55% of the time that s the most in the nfl in passing situations on this dirty long you normally think this gonna be a zone and let him check it down in me the jets <person player="kyle love" race="nonwhite" position="DT">love</person> to bring heat lady hit his first two passes one of his last six jess verse 3 puffing with it the opening to grant s be short of a first down but theyll have a 43yard field goal opportunity a strain the threeman rush no one near <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> he has plenty of time to let some of these secondlevel routes develop that s three hitches in a wideopen receiver thinking about going for here down blink luck s gonna run down signal england s gonna have to take a timeout either way <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> is just in the zone right now i mean he is spinning that ball and you know him and <person player="deion branch" race="nonwhite" position="WR">deion branch</person> have been reunited and they have just that great chemistry unity france has gone for years he was telling us in our meeting you know thomas talking about him they just have a great feel for each other what the route is how it s gonna develop ill make a decision theyre going into the wind gonna force the jets to go into the wind of the second quarter with maybe even 13 or 17 point whole fourth down time patriot s look like theyre gonna go for it on 4th down here jobs yeah <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> really has any nice clean pocket so far tonight and you play <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> you must make him uncomfortable if not he s just gonna move in the pocket and find people when he finds his rhythm he will just look at that pocket mobility this is fourth in three from here a field goal would have been 43 yards they made one in this direction from 41 earlier in the quarter civic cheese go for it and <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> picks it up 50 on francisco gun maitreya touchdown all the new england decisions have gone their way everything the jets have tried to do to be aggressive who s worked against rex ryan s team nothing the shortest punch <person player="steve weatherford" race="white" position="P">steve weatherford</person> s career 12 yards gives him a short field and <person player="deion branch" race="nonwhite" position="WR">branch</person> catches it it was a good time out live bill belichick he s going to take would head out lotion him and then set him down and <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> is going to see the full blitz coming all the way watch it he sees <person player="eric smith" race="white" position="DB">eric smith</person> come up and rotate he changes the protection and he calls for a little under route that <person player="deion branch" race="nonwhite" position="WR">deion branch</person> and <person player="danny woodhead" race="white" position="RB">woodhead</person> is going to try to run interference but just take a look at <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> seeing the blitz changing the protection changing the patterns and then throwing a bullet

when you look at the jets historically you know they like to run the football and they have to stay with them <person player="john conner" race="UNK" position="RB">john</person> connor the fullback the rookies from kentucky noticed the terminator he s offset to the way trying to get to the edge to the secondary and sean greaves got 11 first down yards i like this play new york jets using a lot of personnel changes they put heart stock in a game it tied in to block the point and theyre gonna run a hold t play the tackle is gonna block down in the guard brandon more pulls and they get again sean green to the corner and the patriots miss a tackle but this is a powerful back he s from new jersey this sean green he loves whether and he gets stronger as the game goes on give it to him some more in the 28 right back chin bounces off the first chat boat takes minus one to plus one i was talking about the yards that the patriots have given up bill belichick s noticed one of the great defensive minds of the modern nfl and it just clogs your mind to see them last in total yards and passing yards completion percentage and third down percent he s still a great defensive so what s the

patriot seat with a great start to this one leading twenty four two three be careful with <person player="brad smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brad smith</person> you know the new york jets mike have really been a slow starting offensive football team for whatever reason when you start slow and fall behind <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> here for a long night the problem is their defense who started slow as well the defense s for the most part of the season kept them in them games hold it with the wind machine grant <person player="marcus dixon" race="UNK" position="DE">dixon</person> <person player="brad smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brad smith</person> takes it from inside to check that barely gets into 20 pat s of rubber kicks well want to go back to the touchdown let s go through the specifics your hand down doesnt count your wrists in your forearm would be a second body part that is down so there would that have been enough to give you a touchdown it comes down microsecond before the elbow comes down it would have been very close and probably probably would have stayed a touchdown because of the risk to the floor but when you go for a challenge on a spot the first drive of the game you dont have the option of going for a challenge on a scoring play and that s why we should use them and the jets earn a 21point hole no matter what challenge or not <person player="mark sanchez" race="white" position="QB">sanchez</person> called in by home 16th <person player="santonio holmes" race="nonwhite" position="WR">santonio</person> to the 36th in front of kyle erikson the jets are going know how to mount trying to get a rhythm going for this offense oh they are gonna huddle up believe the patriots are moving around on defense stedman in and out of the three and four the <person player="mark sanchez" race="white" position="QB">mark sanchez</person> has got to really take his time to decipher the

from the 43 <person player="ladainian tomlinson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">tomlinson</person> yards for our warrant makes the tackle up front this is a delinquent defense missing two of their starters up front mike right miron prior to the guys keying the rotation are out of the lineup here tonight bird down is short once again i would not be surprised if the jets dont run a bootleg this is when they <person player="kyle love" race="nonwhite" position="DT">love</person> to take chances in short yardage situations it s incomplete for <person player="santonio holmes" race="nonwhite" position="WR">santonio holmes</person> <person player="kyle arrington" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kyle arrington</person> the coverage that s an oldfashioned play in short yardage used to call this sprint right option and youre going to see <person player="braylon edwards" race="nonwhite" position="WR">braylon edwards</person> second time theyre going to go to him on a quick out with <person player="santonio holmes" race="nonwhite" position="WR">holmes</person> over the top cause one outside i think brandon s got a chance to play that joss you have to come up with this catch not an easy catch but in these situations you got to find a way to keep your offense on the field last punch by <person player="steve weatherford" race="white" position="P">weatherford</person> it was 12 yards fortytwo turns it stays on his feet and gets out to the 25 makes the tackle everything going well for the patriots and this vaunted muchballyhooed what s talked about jets defense has not been able to

connolly" race="UNK" position="OG">connolly</person> the starting right guard is the fullback leading the way for green ellis for getting stuck in the backfield and the jets defense finally comes up when the plate thousand <person player="calvin pace" race="nonwhite" position="DE">pace</person> with the penetration michelle good job it s a slant play they continue to run it out of the i formation that time the jets had the right defensive defense called you got to give new york credit theyre an outstanding run defense they get off blocks and they stuff you at the line of scrimmage and they needed it bad right there <person player="santonio holmes" race="nonwhite" position="WR">santonio holmes</person> his back because <person player="jim leonhard" race="white" position="DB">jim</person>

to <person player="dustin keller" race="nonwhite" position="TE">dustin keller</person> the jets take a timeout they have the ball at the 30 with 30 seconds remaining just try to drive down the field and get a little bit of something let it get closer to the facts back here in foxborough there are the numbers were talking about <person player="mark sanchez" race="white" position="QB">sanchez</person> his struggles on the road against the patriots those bottom see numbers updated now 7 of 60 but only one completion over seven yards tonight so it s been all short stuff once im out 30 seconds left it says his throat is cut by <person player="santonio holmes" race="nonwhite" position="WR">holmes</person> i sketched by <person player="santonio holmes" race="nonwhite" position="WR">santonio</person> in front of <person player="kyle arrington" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kyle arrington</person> it s a pickup of 21 and the jets stop it with 22 seconds now out of timeouts this is too deep and mantoman underneath and <person player="mark sanchez" race="white" position="QB">sanchez</person> throws a deep square into <person player="santonio holmes" race="nonwhite" position="WR">santonio holmes</person> who makes a great play on the ball big completion well you can see the hands of <person player="santonio holmes" race="nonwhite" position="WR">santonio holmes</person> much like his touchdown reception from ben roethlisberger to win the super bowl for the steelers boy he just snatches that ball out of the air the new england has been playing a lot of too deep with mantoman underneath and when you see those safeties get that deep over the top there s some room for guys like <person player="santonio holmes" race="nonwhite" position="WR">holmes</person> to work you got to take a shot though <person player="john conner" race="UNK" position="RB">john</person> no get that two minutes where those check downs not gonna get you down the field youre gonna have to throw some of those digs and deeper outs that time <person player="mark sanchez" race="white" position="QB">sanchez</person> took the shot and home delivered for him with a great catch gates rates <person player="john conner" race="UNK" position="RB">john</person> s now go to seven dbs here in 22 seconds left in the jets out of timeouts why to step up to get out of bounds cuz he s out of timeout does a nice job it played by <person player="mark sanchez" race="white" position="QB">sanchez</person> here to get to the 37 yard line as <person player="jermaine cunningham" race="UNK" position="DE">jermaine cunningham</person> was chasing well that time he s got plenty of time because there s three deep safeties back there five men beverage markets out of trouble there s just nowhere to go at the football but again he has the presence to get what he can get out of bounds and stop the clock and theyre in position here for one more completion a quick buck stoppage in a field goal potentially theyre right on the cusp right now the completion inbound hustling up and killing the clock that s right jaws with 14 seconds left <person player="mark sanchez" race="white" position="QB">sanchez</person> throws it spot it s funded by <person player="brad smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brad smith</person> and that world incomplete and for a variety of reasons that was great for the jets <person player="mark sanchez" race="white" position="QB">sanchez</person> im happy with smith and what happened there but first off the fumble wouldve been disastrous in second they wouldnt have gotten another playoff i think mark was was telling <person player="brad smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brad smith</person> you got to work to the sideline so if you do complete he can get out of bounds he s settled right there but i think it was the only shot you got now you throw the hail mary or you work something quick to the sideline to set up a field goal the defense will take away the sideline routes you can see those three safety men that are deep learn to do everything they can and wingman to keep the ball in play seven seconds left <person player="mark sanchez" race="white" position="QB">sanchez</person> looking to stay is moon in the grass and control of taliban chicane that ends the first half the old rules in the grass puts grasping control to protect injury to the quarterback thus its rule the sack and that s what happened to <person player="mark sanchez" race="white" position="QB">sanchez</person> there from <person player="tully bantacain" race="UNK" position="LB">tully</person> banshee came his fourth sack and that brings the first half to an end all patriots to the first half jetson some trouble they get the ball to start the third quarter down by 21 his first bourbon at the toyota halftime show confrontation continue for at least the first 30 minutes hatreds looked like the team that has won all the divisions for the most part of this decade the jets look like the guys who are still trying what will happen to your second half mike tirico <person player="john conner" race="UNK" position="RB">john</person> bruton ron jaworski suzy kolber on the sidelines all right how do the jets get back in this one guys when you look at the first half the jets had eight completions ten incompletions they have to get the ball their hands of their playmakers they better do something quick because the last time bill belichick and <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> lost the lead in the fourth quarter i think you and i were ingrates but just doesnt happen the jets got to pick it up on offense they need one score and one defensive stop they must get back into this game in the next 12 minutes jetts have not even taken it down to the red zone on the patriots thus far tonight new england has controlled all phases of this a patriot defense that has given up a lot of yards not in the first half <person player="danny woodhead" race="white" position="RB">danny woodhead</person> catches balls runs out of the backfield he s on all the returned teams for the most part that s it all for these pets the third quarter kickoff to <person player="brad smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brad smith</person> big kickoff return last week against cincinnati pulled down before he could get in gear at the <person player="matt slater" race="UNK" position="WR">slater</person> brings him down around the 32 well those numbers in the first half the jets coming up with 146 yards on 35 plays not a big average there and patriots out numbers are not i popping but when they have the advantage of field position they cashed it and made the big plays that field position number shows you there the 41 the average star for the pats 22 for new york <person player="mark sanchez" race="white" position="QB">sanchez</person> gives the <person player="ladainian tomlinson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ladainian tomlinson</person> who wants the football and is lucky to get it back <person player="dane fletcher" race="UNK" position="LB">dane fletcher</person> had his hands on it the rookies pre agent from montana state cooked squeezing the homeless have never had the ball justin well take a look right here you see the handoff mark kind of pushed it right through <person player="ladainian tomlinson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ladainian</person> pocket im very fortunate that the jets were able to recover this atreus continue to stem in and out at different defensive alignments middle linebacker gerrard male areas again stepping into a new front <person player="mark sanchez" race="white" position="QB">sanchez</person> with bata home <person player="santonio holmes" race="nonwhite" position="WR">santonio</person> first down 43 for new york with <person player="brian hoyer" race="nonwhite" position="QB">brian</person> schottenheimer it s about completions he wants to get the ball into the hands of his wide receivers its rushes and completes again today theyd like to be around 50 when the game is over these short passes sustain offense and keep the chains moving right now there are 26 runs plus completions it s patrons territory to the 49yard lux of what youve seen guys what weird said <person player="brian hoyer" race="nonwhite" position="QB">brian</person> schottenheimer concentrate power run game have you seen enough theyre too big keep doing it or theyve got every element that you need in a good running game they just have to get some first bounce theyve been unable to sustain drives but if they can stand he s second in twos and fours the playaction pass becomes a a lie of the jets play to get to this one it s a completion down the sideline raylan <person player="braylon edwards" race="nonwhite" position="WR">edwards</person> as patrick side <person player="brandon meriweather" race="nonwhite" position="DB">brandon meriweather</person> think about that s what you need you got to get these receivers in the game <person player="santonio holmes" race="nonwhite" position="WR">holmes</person> makes a big play earlier you see <person player="mark sanchez" race="white" position="QB">sanchez</person> audible to a quick out the <person player="braylon edwards" race="nonwhite" position="WR">braylon edwards</person> he catches the ball and runs right through a tackle and makes a lot of yardage after the gets in the new york jets are in scoring zone jaws nice run after the catch by raylan <person player="braylon edwards" race="nonwhite" position="WR">edwards</person> but he still didnt catch that ball clean first catch of the night for adverts it was 24yard so <person player="dbrickashaw ferguson" race="nonwhite" position="OT">ferguson</person> out there blocking and gets a gain of nearly five i like that play that s a perimeter staple play of the jet running game i called that 99 bunts crunch youre going to see the down blocks and the tack will pull and theyre going to toss the ball to elfi around the edge you got to keep running this play against these a gap blitzes that the patriots are running thatll hit no callahan clothes on your staff <person player="john conner" race="UNK" position="RB">john</person> the

player="brad smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brad smith</person> for the direct snap they were an option out of the pistol formation rob nim kovitch makes the tackle they gain two yards its fourth and water well you know my feeling of these types of plays i think you dystrophy outsmart yourself sometimes well it looks like youre gonna lead right behind he s gonna take off to his left that he s gonna dart right off tackle he tried to get the defense to fall one way and cut it back against the grain in reps go 14:1 one to the left looking left the slant is caught by <person player="santonio holmes" race="nonwhite" position="WR">holmes</person> at the 11 yard line for our first down you know one thing <person player="mark sanchez" race="white" position="QB">mark

started when the jets have struggled in the red zone this year offensively <person player="mark sanchez" race="white" position="QB">mark sanchez</person> hasnt thrown an interception here but he s been very conservative and against his own defense the patriots are playing were almost there in the jets to run it in the first and the one quick strike intercepted there s brandy of <person player="mark sanchez" race="white" position="QB">sanchez</person> he has not done the red zone but a critical mistake there <person player="mark sanchez" race="white" position="QB">mark sanchez</person> has thrown 49 red zone passes coming into tonight without being intercepted and hadnt been sacked in the red zone only quarterback who s thrown 30 balls are more down there and had

this stadium this time of year one reason he s closing in on his 26th great regularseason victory is he can handle the ball in this weather the bad feel up 28 from their own six 50 yards and is you have to treat him almost as a wide receiver he has that kind of skill the combination of <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> and <person player="aaron

patriots to have standing job and you can see the mobility in the pocket of <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> or stuff while you kind of get the feeling right now that bill belichick <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> theyre sending a message this jets defense here we out the score thirty one two three and theyre dropping back and swinging it what time effort there s <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> is faking the ball to a tight end and is just like derek jeter flipping the ball to the outside i saw brett favre in lambeau when i was a young coach and when this it s not that cold tonight but tom grainy this weather this wind it s not a problem for me who does that

the middle the end zone four ticks down passes to four different receivers the latest <person player="aaron hernandez" race="UNK" position="TE">aaron hernandez</person> backtoback drives of 93 and 94 against the wanted jets defense one of the big matchups coming into foxborough tonight this matchup of nine and two teams atop the afc the patriots defense first in the nfl scoring points the jets defense fourth in giving up voice jetts havent come close 38 for new england tonight and still a quarter to go <person player="brad smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brad smith</person> from the five shackled by matthew <person player="matt slater" race="UNK" position="WR">slater</person> s of a couple of special teams tackle well we said <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> s a fierce competitor and watch this reaction after the last touchdown pass there s one to his bench and now he turns to the jet bench and that one three you guys and then after the touchdown of the extra point bill belichick gathered the entire patriots team with his message <person player="john conner" race="UNK" position="RB">john</person> i would guess about finishing here and the young team needing to understand that these are still opportunities to send messages and he s gonna let them all know im watching every one of you good teaching moment <person

<person player="kyle arrington" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kyle arrington</person> the tackle again the perspective in the standings the winner tonight the jets are listed as the division leader for the moment because they won the first headtohead the patriots and jets would be tought wed be switching spots the pats atop it the jets would go over to the ravens and the differences the division leaders of the top four seeds in the wildcard the five and the six seed but two paths away from home in the playoffs and fair or not that s what happens like baltimore in pittsburgh last night win these head to heads it s the difference of a or a road to the playout to the super bowl topple to first down snow bike one of the keys to the patriots success not just now but in recent years is the turnover ratio and <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> takes care of the football and so do these running backs their plus two tonight i believe theyre plus two maybe even plus three but they win the turnover battle they score 30 points at game and they beat you josh now theyre plus 11 comments although their defense is giving up a lot of points and a lot of yards turnovers certainly save them <person player="ladainian tomlinson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">tomlinson</person> carries the 41 you were right <person player="john conner" race="UNK" position="RB">john</person> it s plus two here for the patriots tonight you talked about every coach yet besides it hill belcheck talking about the lack of turnovers only nine turnovers for this team now threequarters the way through the season tied with kansas city for the best in the nfl that s unbelievably that guys like <person player="danny woodhead" race="white" position="RB">danny woodhead</person> i mean ben jarvis green ellis has never fumbled the ball in his career these running backs just got here theyre not even on the depth chart in training camp and they dont fumble the ball ever to credit the ivy spheres in this patriot that coach <person player="mark sanchez" race="white" position="QB">sanchez</person> tada got out of it now gets hit an incomplete <person player="jermaine cunningham" race="UNK" position="DE">jermaine cunningham</person> almost had another sack im just shocked that the jets have not got anything done tonight in any phase ron they struggled kicking the ball catching the ball throwing the ball and stopping the patriots but all three phases dominant by the new england patriots well it s obvious his patriots defense had something to prove came in here tonight giving up just under 400 yards games they thought they were better than that tonight they keep a much better than that theyre terrible on their down jaws giving up almost 51% tonight the jets have stopped it tend to tense on third down tonight after the change <person player="james sanders" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sanders</person> interception his third and history lamarque <person player="mark sanchez" race="white" position="QB">sanchez</person> on matson ended i know this games out of hand 38 to 3 but he had no right to try to squeeze that ball in there it was just busted <person player="james sanders" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sanders</person> right in the numbers three interceptions in the last six passes thrown by <person player="mark sanchez" race="white" position="QB">sanchez</person> tonight well there are <person player="james sanders" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sanders</person> right there on the left ear screen i dont know where youre throwing that ball now you got to see that throw there s a safety sitting right in the hook zone and throws it right you had no chance to get that ball to <person player="santonio holmes" race="nonwhite" position="WR">holmes</person> sam amara joins green ellis in the backfield and the pitcher to keep throwing were thin jarvis green ellis to the 22 yard line tough night for mark says three intercept tonight then you know this is that maturation process of quarterbacks gonna go through on the road hostile environment you cant make these kinds of mistake these trolls who take your team out of the foot this is one of those learning spirits that <person player="mark sanchez" race="white" position="QB">mark sanchez</person> gonna have to go through defensive backs linebackers safeties theyll read those eyes right now <person player="mark sanchez" race="white" position="QB">sanchez</person> staring down two receivers patriots follow in his eyes to the football to carry just to amplify <person player="john conner" race="UNK" position="RB">john</person> s point earlier on this wing without fence it s on what <person player="danny woodhead" race="white" position="RB">danny woodhead</person> in ben jarvis green ellis when he started to do the numbers game with the patriots of the preseason some wondered if green else would make the team certainly one of the guys who had to prove it in the preseason would head didnt make the jets he was cut so essentially the two running backs were playing the lion s share of the snaps here are guys who we didnt know if they would be in the nfl once the season started look at the jets on defense i mean the patriots are substituting so many different personnel groupings it s hard not only for the jets it s hard for me to match up up here job i dont have tough time getting lined up and for progress it is very close to the first down at the 18th the patriot players so very confident with the extra time about their gameplay that everybody says that we got a great game plan but <person player="deion branch" race="nonwhite" position="WR">deion branch</person> and grady the guys have been around here really very effusive in their confidence about what they had in store tonight and the matchups have been great you know what what i liked about <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> when he talked to us you know he had great respect for the jets defense and <person player="darrelle revis" race="nonwhite" position="DB">darrelle revis</person> and <person player="antonio cromartie" race="nonwhite" position="DB">antonio cromartie</person> and he knew they were talented players but he felt he could get the matchups inside he liked those quicker guys you know when you look at <person player="darrelle revis" race="nonwhite" position="DB">revis</person> you know when youre looking for my they liked inyourface and be physical it s hard to be physical against those quick guarding tight receivers and the patient receivers did an excellent job tonight you dont have selectmen consistent reported an interrupt you know tom talked about after the game that he looks at doesnt lick his own personal stats he looked at the receivers and how he targeted them how many throws went to each receiver he really believes that x equitable distribution in the past and if all the guys happened he s got 27 touchdown passes in four interceptions fans want him to go for it on fourth and inches they will and in green alice gets the first down then jarvis green alice takes it inside the 71st and gold for the patriots we talked about this the winger team and grady and all the receivers belichick is a scheme and everything else the guys in the football witness protection program is this guy bill obrien nobody talks about bill is the offensive coordinator 12 years as a college assistant the acc at maryland georgia tech came here and we know josh mcdaniels was fired today in denver when that happened bill obrien has taken over the lion s share of the play calling here the last few years <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> has been very complimentary of the relationship with obrien and his abilities people that are going to be hiring coaches are going to know exactly who he is i want to go back now mike this patriot offense hasnt been this balanced in the last couple of years and it s the hardest thing to defend the more you do well the further you will go in the playoffs and right now im seeing new england run the ball inside outside throw short passes long passes to tight ends three tight ends no tight ends and <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> s the quarterback theyve been unstoppable against the great defense tonight second a goal and bitch america thought this was going to have power play may watts a left guard watch <person player="logan mankins" race="nonwhite" position="OG">mankins</person> pull and lead this one back power off of to dublin thames missed tackles and just great finish he walks in he goes in stand in jaws as <person player="sebastian vollmer" race="white" position="OT">sebastian</person> fullmer the right tackle just blocked blocking jets into the end zone 6 yards downfield missile of his offensive line tonight the fans may have been fantastic some close to new york or kicking back and saying a lot same old jess got to the big game and didnt work doing the patriots tonight nine possessions six touchdowns in one field wall good five to three that s my creative alice smith runs up on its in the 16th tackled at the 40 by rob vintage 9:15 here in the fourth yes they have the game is perhaps division winning plays well see how it plays out sean greene the carry to the 45yard line will be jets in 1986 where ten and one came into a big game on monday night football against the dolphins got their doors blown off it s the last time they trailed by 42 points november 24th of 86 it s starting to tailspin the jets lost to the rams the 49ers the steelers the bengals backed into the playoffs beat the chiefs and then lost a a double overtime game at cleveland for the browns carry by green for a first down play those who game with mark gaston double overtime was called for a roughing the passer call late hit that extended a drive and the browns kicked the gamewinning field goal to win twenty three to twenty somebody grew up from jets fan yeah mike tirico i remember remember jet fans have been down that road many a tongue it works with the catch to the 33 and is a sports center right now with trey wingo all right michael thank you not the monday the jets were hoping for certainly not the monday josh mcdaniels was hoping for relieved of his head coaching duties in denver his team lost 17 over the last 22 games running back coach erik stewartville is the interim head coach and urban quarterback cam newton leads the floor heisman trophy finalist today let s go back to the game thank you janet <person player="jarrad page" race="UNK" position="DB">page</person> to davis on green inside the 30 to 29 yard he s talked about how quickly things change in the nfl josh mcdaniels was the play caller in the coordinator for the best statistical offense and the patriots put up all those points in 2007 they put up thirty six point eight points a game got off to the great start in denver in the o9 season six you know only five wins after that fires here today <person player="dustin keller" race="nonwhite" position="TE">dustin keller</person> again <person player="jerod mayo" race="nonwhite" position="LB">mayo</person> brings him down inside the 15 late job air by <person player="mark sanchez" race="white" position="QB">sanchez</person> he saw the blitz found his hot receiver jessica knock this fan says with confidence cause im gonna need some khatri let s hit <person player="devin mccourty" race="nonwhite" position="DB">devin mccourty</person> wraps him up he talked about that this is only one game and theyll still be nine and three and youre you know the patriots have tough games in the last quarter of the season as do the jets but you wonder what will be the after effect of this game when you put a lot of chips into the table and the other guys pulled them all to their side well rex ryan been around for a long time he understands this game hell say hey we got embarrassed we didnt play well give all the credit to the patriots and hell get his team ready for next week i think theyre too good of a football team to pay their tents these are all games and the jets have come in here they just barely got by the browns they barely got by the lions there are no easy games in the nfl a lot of football left to be played jets are gonna have to lick their wounds and third and five with a threeman rush there are eight cutlery and confusing santos and by the same token the negatives that the jets will take out of this the positives this patriots defense will take out of their anthem here tonight i think that s a big thing for the patriots you know their defense has been under the gun look at the coverage right there by <person player="kyle arrington" race="nonwhite" position="DB">arrington</person> right on <person player="santonio holmes" race="nonwhite" position="WR">holmes</person> but one thing about this defense you know theyre young micah said it a few minutes ago 25 and a half years old this is the type of game that so much on the line hazy spotting in a positive way this could just bond the defensive group together <person player="ladainian tomlinson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">tomlinson</person> had to call timeout <person player="mark sanchez" race="white" position="QB">sanchez</person> didnt see the play clock running down sadducees but cant run fast enough for the jets there s a new red sock pretty good monday boston sports patriots fans who have hung around on this bitterly cold night <person player="kyle love" race="nonwhite" position="DT">love</person> to see them stop the jets will let you listen to them on fourth down raun span of interesting fourthdown and they would like to score but you decide on that situation and throw the ball to <person player="ladainian tomlinson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ladainian tomlinson</person> who <person player="matt light" race="white" position="OT">light</person> up lined up out wide and yet some other favorable matchups but that s the way the night s been going for the jets here <person player="ladainian tomlinson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ladainian</person> didnt see it there the guy who s got his hands on the defense bill belichick thrilled and rex ryan s been a very similar approach and look all night <person player="mark sanchez" race="white" position="QB">sanchez</person> struggled against his patriots defense we talk about their youth and we mentioned earlier that bill belichick is the defensive coordinator in this group he is coaching the team in those defensive meetings during the week with <person player="fred taylor" race="nonwhite" position="RB">fred taylor</person> now in it for norwood turns off the toa dream is no game there we talk about belichick coaching the defense that time the belichick has had to spend putting together the defensive game plans kept him from doing something he s done with <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> throughout and that is looking at the offensive film together as it prepares for the game two each week he go back over the last decade of <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> as the starter and he and belichick would get together and watched game film and prepare so you can see what belcheck weve seen they havent been able to do it because of the defensive work bells bills had to do but they got to it in this by week there s off week and tom say help to crystallize the plan against the jets he said it was invaluable and i could understand why the quarterback youre so concerned about doing your job and running youre off it s all sudden you start hearing from a defensive perspective what theyre trying to do what their plan is and tom said boy it was just it was good to be back with bill and spend some time with him they looked the last couple games against the jets and obviously did we need some real good things off the tape and show tom belichick taught <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> how to study film how to study defense his personnel he created a posture yes he did his mouth down as <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> was pressured eric ship knocked it down with a penalty marker to him back in the secondary <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> and belichick on their way to another win as a tandem together that will get them to 108 feet be 107 i beg your pardon move up to tie terry bradshaw and chuck noll secondmost head coach quarterback combo wins in nfl history and trying to move in closer with a 9 of dan marino and don shula of the alltime record for wins as a head coach and a quarterback together so they will equal <person player="deion branch" race="nonwhite" position="WR">branch</person> on knoll here tonight amazing <person player="john conner" race="UNK" position="RB">john</person> how a great quarterback makes a great coach great quarterbacks really help with the babies and great coaches i saw this judge that too many men on the field give me the patriots the first down at the 20 it s taylor for a couple of yards for the top 15 rushes in nfl history <person player="fred taylor" race="nonwhite" position="RB">fred taylor</person> who came over a couple of years ago from jacksonville as a free agent he s been out with turf toe since late september and another veteran to have around for the playoff run he and <person player="ladainian tomlinson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ladainian tomlinson</person> the top active running backs in terms of rushing yards in nfl history there s a man right there <person player="fred taylor" race="nonwhite" position="RB">fred taylor</person> over 11,000 yards and they were tough ert earned every one of them that s how <person player="fred taylor" race="nonwhite" position="RB">fred</person> played the game and he was a violent runner shackled bison feet oh mike devivo the stop know the difference between one of the great quarterbacks in the world and the young quarterback watch <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> on his playaction in the red zone he looks where he wants to go with the ball but his primaries covered so he pulls it down he escapes through his left guess what throws a touchdown pass similar play <person player="mark sanchez" race="white" position="QB">sanchez</person> on a playaction pass in the red zone doesnt have his primary receiver but he forces it time to push up slide to his left maybe look to create but this guy has so much poise so much vision so much experience but to dog week a lot of people are wondering why <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> s in the game two minutes and 40 seconds left it s 45 to 3 we said this a couple weeks ago this guy loves the compete and these are the most satisfying times there are youll work for 10 days to get a rematch with the jets nobody s ever swept <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> twice in one season and he aint coming off the field for anybody this poor <person player="brian hoyer" race="nonwhite" position="QB">hoyer</person> he may never get to play but we did see it practice at least <person player="brian hoyer" race="nonwhite" position="QB">brian hoyer</person> did get some reps of practice <person player="joe mcknight" race="UNK" position="RB">joe mcknight</person> the rookie out of southern california about the punch at 31 and is taken out over by midfield <person player="sergio brown" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sergio brown</person>e neighbor stop <person player="john conner" race="UNK" position="RB">john</person> when we were talking during the week of gaza trying to capsulize what s the key to the game what s the most important thing go back to something you said at the very beginning it s a veteran team with the young quarterback and a young quarterback with a veteran team and then we see what happened tonight that veteran quarterback the guy with the experience got it done in a begin i dont think veterans a good word for <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> how about a veteran bull mvp you name it the guy s unbelievable and you got a credit him he has really taken over this football team on game day and bill belichick he cant deny he s done a tremendous job with his young team as well fast some greens carries should take us down to the twominute warning here in foxborough you know this jets defense is built on pass rush pleasure as we talked all night theyre a blitzing defense if you can negate those blitzes if your offensive line your bats can pick them up give grady time you could expose even great quarterbacks like <person player="antonio cromartie" race="nonwhite" position="DB">antonio cromartie</person> and <person player="darrelle revis" race="nonwhite" position="DB">darrelle revis</person> and one of the big games the jets have had in recent memory in the regular season and they came up empty forty five to three of the twominute
