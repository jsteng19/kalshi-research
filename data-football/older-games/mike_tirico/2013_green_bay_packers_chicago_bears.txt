============================================================

our weather tonight 49 degrees could be a colder this time of year here in wisconsin the wind will be left to right as you watch at 50 miles per hour it s in fact going in the other direction but hitting the inside of the stadium and swirling soon as you watch the game itll be impacted going left to right light shower perhaps in the forecast before the night is done bears won the toss and they deferred so the packers will get the ball first <person player="micah hyde" race="nonwhite" position="DB">micah hyde</person> back deep to receive for green bay took a punt back 93 yards last week four tucked down in the packers sunday night victory over minnesota <person player="robbie gould" race="white" position="K">robbie gould</person> set to kick it off all falling off the tee twice so hell bring <person player="craig steltz" race="white" position="DB">craig</person> scouts down to hold it and his momentum that breeze itll factor in a bit here as the night goes on walk around town today you see a bunch of bears fans around but of course cheese heads it s a day <person player="kyle long" race="white" position="OG">long</person> party they love monday night games folks started tailgating at 7:00 am outside lambeau and off we go for number 187 with the bears and the packers no return for hind <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> will take over at the 20 yard line as we talked about the beginning all the pieces missing yet <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">rodgers</person> has the receivers performing of a high level he s a veteran it s experienced man who turns 30 on december 2nd and job what happens around green bay with this offense all emanates and number 12 arm and ox and it had a lot of continuity not only at the quarterback position but mike mccarthy this coaching staff has been working with rogers for a <person player="kyle long" race="white" position="OG">long</person> time it shows opening drive starts in twenty raja s cut bullets cupboard takes off to begin the night and runs for about nine yard a jump in plastic able to trip him up and immediately he comes to a halt with personal foul grabbing the facemask number 92 those tackles <person player="stephen paea" race="nonwhite" position="DT">stephen paea</person> first flag leave oh this packer offense is more balanced than it has been theyve got a great passing attack but a formidable rushing attack and expect a lot of no huddle offense tonight they want <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> in control theyve had a lot of backup players step up and become stars in the last couple weeks mike the toss just a couple of yards <person player="eddie lacy" race="nonwhite" position="RB">eddie lacy</person> launches carries here he said 24 or more touches the last four years so <person player="eddie lacy" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lacy</person> the second round pick out of alabama a whole bunch of championship rings three in his four years theyre playing for <person player="nick perry" race="nonwhite" position="LB">nick</person> saban and only <person player="zach minter" race="UNK" position="DT">zach</person> stacy who we saw last week with st louis there s the rookie with more rushing yards than lacey and right away you see the no huddle offense chicago with two rookie linebackers theyre going to try to stress them immediately rogers machine <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">jordy nelson</person> on the move territory the 28yard pick up the 26 should pass you get the running game going youre going to see some nasty playaction passes from <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> but <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">jordy nelson</person> s in the slot little playaction fake will freeze the linebackers and there s nobody there for <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">jordy nelson</person> nice pickup by <person player="eddie lacy" race="nonwhite" position="RB">eddie lacy</person> the running back and that was easy key for this packers offense <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">nelson</person> who s rolling <person player="james jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">james jones</person> back to his knee in trees blocking on the edge that s lacey puts the shoulder down inside the 15 another first down for green bay that s what we covered in the pregame mike if youre gonna play cover two and have these safeties 20 yards deep <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> is just going to toss the ball on the edge to <person player="eddie lacy" race="nonwhite" position="RB">eddie lacy</person> and make somebody make an open field tackle how think chicago can play that loose in the secondary or <person player="eddie lacy" race="nonwhite" position="RB">eddie lacy</person> will pound them three receivers out there letting <person player="eddie lacy" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lacy</person> run inside trying to get to the 10 yard line and <person player="corey wootton" race="UNK" position="DE">corey</person> wooten and <person player="stephen paea" race="nonwhite" position="DT">stephen paea</person> finally pulled down inside the 10 and it s an area that the packers have been very good at in recent years red zone touchdown production and they dont have the weapons that they have had on the outside <person player="jarrett boykin" race="UNK" position="WR">boykin</person> secondyear man has had some catches in recent weeks but this is where timing with new young receivers is difficult as a light mist begins to fall again second and eight when rogers pressured by <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">peppers</person> steps up throws incomplete julia s <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">peppers</person> who has struggled this year just once sack able to get in there and move rogers off the spot they need <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">peppers</person> because chicago has had no pass rush at all this year nine sex <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">julius peppers</person> has just one they need to heat the pass rushed up like the bears are accustomed to doing it they have an inexperienced linebacking poor led by <person player="jonathan bostic" race="UNK" position="LB">jonathan bostic</person>k and if the bears dont get three turnovers from their defense i think theyre in trouble tonight we do have <person player="charles tillman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">charles tillman</person> playing off that good knee injury that s kept him from playing four games the last few weeks thornton eight chased down by say mcluhan who gets his foot a sack of the year and brings rogers down and it will be fourth down that s the chicago bear defense and im accustomed to see let s see if rogers is okay mike he stayed down there for a second with the backend of the play you see shane mcclelland working against berkeley on the right side rogers has time but it s good after to the football by mcclellan and rogers went down hard on his throwing shoulder as he goes off <person player="mason crosby" race="white" position="K">mason crosby</person> to attempt a 30yard field goal for the packers and it s good so <person player="mason crosby" race="white" position="K">crosby</person> able to get points out of it to make it three nothing and certainly the concern right now with green bay is <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">rodgers</person> who hit the deck hard on the sack by mcclellan on third down espn s monday night football is brought to you by toyota care schedule maintenance no cost verizon never be

field tonight aerial coverage from green bay brought to you by directv the packers get a field goal with the concerns <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> who got up on the sidelines was throwing a couple of passes with the backup quarterback <person player="seneca wallace" race="nonwhite" position="QB">seneca wallace</person> but the training staff bring even over to look at that left shoulder one more time coming down on that nonpassing shoulder as shane mcclelland brought all the way down on the time machine <person player="mason crosby" race="white" position="K">crosby</person> kicks off and <person player="devin hester" race="nonwhite" position="DB">devin hester</person> 19 returns for touchdown this career fake still averse and <person player="devin hester" race="nonwhite" position="DB">hester</person> inside of the 30 at the 27 yard loss so <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">rodgers</person> is hurt <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">cutler</person> s bounce the groin injury against <person player="cornelius washington" race="nonwhite" position="LB">washington</person> two weeks ago the last games with <person player="josh mccown" race="white" position="QB">josh mccown</person> a veteran third round pick of arizona back 11 years ago 13 there s for a few seasons now 13 and 20 as a starter including christmas night 2011 here in green bay now when he came in against <person player="cornelius washington" race="nonwhite" position="LB">washington</person> he looked much better than he did during that first tenure with the bears <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">cutler</person> injured mchale moved the offense with seeing things and as john said before everyone we talked to him a lot of confidence at <person player="josh mccown" race="white" position="QB">mccown</person> didnt run the offense effectively tonight the 29 is first throw is caught by <person player="brandon marshall" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brandon marshall</person> at the 42 yard line meantime <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> going to job towards the locker room here on the packers sideline so <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">rodgers</person> and well get probably xrayed as he is going in with the training staff of green bay so certainly the murmur goes through lambeau field as they see their star going back to get that left shoulder or arm check off the 41 obamacare is not down the edge ramon williams the corner breaks it up down the dom capers a defensive coordinator loves to bring perimeter pressure he brings more defensive backs in the charge than most coordinators that time sherman williams comes right off the slot he bets the ball down but dom capers a lot of different looks in his base defense and in his sub package and this is where they want <person player="josh mccown" race="white" position="QB">mccown</person> in second in <person player="kyle long" race="white" position="OG">long</person> a second attempt for 34 yearold back to pass it s complete again <person player="brandon marshall" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brandon marshall</person> accelerating in to pack the territory and out of bounds after a gain of 19 how about marc trestman coming out with mcgowan and three straight passes just a little fake to <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">forte</person> and youre going to see marshall coming from right to left no pass rush whatsoever and that is the number one area where the bears have improved as an offense and it s in the offensive line if you get <person player="brandon marshall" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brandon marshall</person> time to get open in the middle of your defense he can wear you out pitches already for marshall bleh ive hidden the counter put it up again loading the rock she was getting rid of it over the head of <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">forte</person> john give us a little thumbnail on what to look for when chicago has the ball well as i just said i think this offensive line is upgraded tremendously an errant chrome or the offensive coordinator is the offensive line coach much improved and the ball distribution is better it s not just throw it to <person player="brandon marshall" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brandon marshall</person> jeffries is catching passes youll see <person player="martellus bennett" race="nonwhite" position="TE">martellus bennett</person> it tight in and the marc trestman factor will be huge tonight he s an excellent offensive coach and anything goes with marc trestman youll see anything from readoption to various forms of west coast offense weve got christmas having trouble getting the place and you saw somebody standing by trestman were looking at the wireless communication that talks into the headset of the quarterback a little confusion running late timeout chicago there is <person player="seneca wallace" race="nonwhite" position="QB">seneca wallace</person> who has not taken a snap even in the preseason with the packers he was not with green bay during his preseason he continues to warm as <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> is being checked after he was injured on a third down play in that last series for the packers also barry s timeout to the head out sean jeffrey this talented secondyear receiver out of south carolina for the first down to the 26 yard line up the gut linebacker blitz good play selection by <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron</person> cromer on the bear sideline and he s bare wide receivers blocked for one another look at <person player="brandon marshall" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brandon marshall</person> herb bennett escort out shy jeffries for a first down good anticipation of the blitz marshall and <person player="alshon jeffery" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jeffery</person> do a lot without the ball for this bear offense and we need to point that out to all those young receivers out there you can be a good locker john from the packers darren his left shoulder injury his return questionable first intent six straight passes for the bears <person player="josh mccown" race="white" position="QB">josh mccown</person> with an end zone shot marshall cant bring it in in coverage <person player="sam shields" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sam shields</person> battling a toe injury that s a throw <person player="josh mccown" race="white" position="QB">josh mccown</person> needs to hit it s a double move a little stutter go and <person player="brandon marshall" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brandon marshall</person> ran right by <person player="sam shields" race="nonwhite" position="DB">shields</person> you have to let the big man go up and get that one just slightly under thrown but an aggressive first fit of team by this bear coaching staff theyve come in to green bay tonight with a backup quarterback coming off their bye week very aggressive openers now marshall being looked at by the athletic training staff the bears this season of attrition continues first run that is <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">matt forte</person> since i was 25 down to the 23 trim on williams the corner joins the safety <person player="morgan burnett" race="nonwhite" position="DB">morgan burnett</person> on the stop well you see marshall going up so often and contesting to those passes and leaving himself awkward as he comes down there it wasnt anything about an awkward and landing you see with his one leg extended and this is the dime package at dom capers his famous formica hide checks into the game number 33 he s a rookie from iowa they like to blitz him off the slot marshall back out there 36page a north korean pressure water packers cover the county able to get it away to marshall did he catch it in barrels call the touchdown monster of the midway <person player="brandon marshall" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brandon marshall</person> makes one of the great hexes ive seen him make there is a flag down in the end zone and the hot to take a look cb was in balance as well pressures on you have to credit the 38 defense you have to credit <person player="josh mccown" race="white" position="QB">josh mccown</person> for getting the ball up under intense pressure in <person player="brandon marshall" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brandon marshall</person> goes over the wrong shoulder to find this football and make an acrobatic catch and track the sidelines great work jump on the town to hang in there with all that pressure around him and marshall brings in his sixth touchdown reception of the year robbi goal that s their point all the oneplay was a pass the bears were their backup quarterback <person player="josh mccown" race="white" position="QB">mccown</person> walking down the field the touchdown scored by marshall certainly an interesting start to this one <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> gets hurt on the opening drive for a field goal two minute and 36 seconds scoring drive the bears come back without <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">jay cutler</person> who s working hard there on the sidelines he s very involved and demonstrative with that chicago offensive brain trust and they just watched his backup <person player="josh mccown" race="white" position="QB">josh mccown</person> bring him down the field throw it to <person player="brandon marshall" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brandon marshall</person> for a 23 yard score they drive that also took 236 and now cynical <person player="seneca wallace" race="nonwhite" position="QB">wallace</person> will take over a quarterback for green bay with <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> being looked at in the locker ooh well kick in to <person player="micah hyde" race="nonwhite" position="DB">micah</person> high high with no return packers will take over from the 20yard line a lot of questions of an ask green bay has been searching for a backup quarterback because <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">rodgers</person> has been so dependable he s only missed two games one because of injury since he became the starter so <person player="seneca wallace" race="nonwhite" position="QB">seneca wallace</person> who spent this preseason with new orleans and san francisco about to take his first snap with the green bay packers 33 years old drafted by seattle in 2003 didnt play as first couple of years late for the browns last back in 2010 and 2011 now quarterbacking the green bay packers from the 20 anyway on the run to the left the only games in yard <person player="jonathan bostic" race="UNK" position="LB">jonathan bostic</person>k able to tackle and jong obviously a lot changes here as well as four places rogers for now yeah a lot changes in the green bay huddle and in the chicago huddle you just saw the bears jump into an eightman front they dont respect <person player="seneca wallace" race="nonwhite" position="QB">seneca wallace</person> theyre gonna make <person player="seneca wallace" race="nonwhite" position="QB">seneca wallace</person> do some things that they havent seen him do as a green bay packer and that is going to allow them to challenge these receivers remember he hasnt thrown a regular season passing some time last with a snap in 2011 an nfl game out of the league last year <person player="eddie lacy" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lacy</person> runs it right and he s pulled down by <person player="james anderson" race="nonwhite" position="LB">james anderson</person> it s good enough for a first down when you get a lot of sugaring up in these gaps from these linebackers why not just toss the ball around the edge good down block by number 81 corliss and anyways is a very good northsouth finisher you have to get bodies to lay see he can drag the pile if you give them too many oneonone situations see mike mccarthy and jonathan asking here about how it changes for the head coach the play caller they just sent the heavy guys in to block and now theyve changed it brought out <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">jordy nelson</person> to two receivers as a lacey runs the only games in yards so every every coach has a disaster plan you have these meetings every week so how does the play calling change through sir mike mccarthy when <person player="seneca wallace" race="nonwhite" position="QB">wallace</person> comes in oh this is drastic change for mike mccarthy because he didnt even have <person player="seneca wallace" race="nonwhite" position="QB">seneca</person> in the preseason so that list of plays has shrunk tremendously that s why youve seen three consecutive runs look for some high percentage quick passes and theyll see how <person player="seneca wallace" race="nonwhite" position="QB">seneca wallace</person> can handle his oakley possession second at nine it s another run <person player="eddie lacy" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lacy</person> looking up the middle of the bears are in form but he counts top three would be tackles and takes tina to me movement great hard run for a lazy person im a very creative shotgun running attack here in green bay watch coon come back side and seal the edge it s an inside zone gift to <person player="eddie lacy" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lacy</person> and he just moves the pile he runs right over <person player="stephen paea" race="nonwhite" position="DT">stephen paea</person> missed tackled by <person player="major wright" race="UNK" position="DB">major</person> right and he finishes he gives the green bay packers of physical presence much like marshawn lynch gives the seattle seahawks pappas yards after he s been contacted <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">peppers</person> rushing off the edge the first dollars passed his clock by miles <person player="myles white" race="UNK" position="WR">white</person> s first down to the 43 yard line <person player="myles white" race="UNK" position="WR">white</person> a rookie out of louisiana tech he got to give mike mccarthy credit he uses miles <person player="myles white" race="UNK" position="WR">white</person> against <person player="tim jennings" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tim jennings</person> the pro bowl corner on a little stutter go hitch and miles <person player="myles white" race="UNK" position="WR">white</person> has another catch undrafted free agent theyre going after a pro bowl corner to the wide side of the field with a backup quarterback that study and to the gain of eight running the right in lay cement five busted bounces off of them and finally pulled as hard running only seeing plastic those strangers says they met with one plate for alabama the other florida in their sec days the last <person player="lance briggs" race="nonwhite" position="LB">briggs</person> in her locker saying wow want to be a linebacker to the national football league these are the plays that you have to make in green bay israel ac 20 times or more four consecutive games and theyre well on her way to do it again content for <person player="seneca wallace" race="nonwhite" position="QB">seneca wallace</person> in for the injured <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> is he hands again to <person player="eddie lacy" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lacy</person> and comes up to the 35 yard line to a gain of four <person player="james anderson" race="nonwhite" position="LB">james anderson</person> in on <person player="eddie lacy" race="nonwhite" position="RB">eddie lacy</person> doesnt have a lot of mileage on his body like three years at alabama he had some injuries he shared the ball with a number of different tailbacks but he has come in here and really rejuvinated this offensive line they love the physical aspect of running the football and it s really helped their past potentially he s out <person player="james starks" race="UNK" position="RB">james starks</person> is the running back of the slant is deflected and intercepted by <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">peppers</person> <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">julius</person> dear life was <person player="tj lang" race="white" position="OT">tj</person> lay but the pic on that slab that rogers throws so well and so effectively that time the bears getting away and <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">peppers</person> comes up with the tip and the picture well if you throw a hot in the running game you better be alert where <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">julius peppers</person> is because his wingspan just changed his game interception number nine for <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">julius peppers</person> who has been very quiet this year and then pulled out a bunch of rebounds during his time playing some basketball in addition to his great football days at north carolina it s the block in the pic fair and now the bears take over impactor territory at the 45 run for two yards for four days go back to the interception this is a running play to <person player="james starks" race="UNK" position="RB">starks</person> and he sees the eightman front so <person player="seneca wallace" race="nonwhite" position="QB">seneca wallace</person> just picks it up and throws a slant away from the strong safety and <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">julius peppers</person> bats it down and has the presence to intercept the football this is a big part of the packer offense mike if they load the box they have run game solutions with these builtin slant route set time julia s pepper says not on my he s <person player="josh mccown" race="white" position="QB">josh mccown</person> great field position back to throw again he slings it complete <person player="martellus bennett" race="nonwhite" position="TE">martellus</person> bentham through his hands and incomplete the tight end start his career with dallas had a breakthrough season last year for the giants has been a very big part of chicago s pass offense this year once again dom capers goes to his dine package rookie day tone jones their first rounder from ucla checks in as an inside pass rusher this has been a glitch down for the packers this season they came earlier got burned on the touchdown to <person player="brandon marshall" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brandon marshall</person> let s see if dom capers brings some old pressure play clock running down russian fool accountants that know where to go and he slides sort of the line of scrimmage so well be on loss and the packer defense despite seeing chicago take over a good field position able to force the three and out i really like they tone jones their first rounder he hasnt made a lot of plays mike but he s a walk around hybrid type defender that can mirror the quarterback and has the first to come and get you nice play by the rookie out of ucla and he will get credited with the set at a publish temari lotta more comes through gets it and a great swing of field position as the packers will take over the 32 green bay s getting their money s worth out at <person player="jamari lattimore" race="UNK" position="LB">lattimore</person> he was a third string linebacker when the season started and now youre going to see him playing on special teams coming off the right side nobody accounted phil and <person player="jamari lattimore" race="UNK" position="LB">lattimore</person> s become the starting inside linebacker and a critical part of their special teams great work in there s a hole a flaw and this bears punt protection that is the first time pot wishes had a punt block to his nfl career heaved on the first 428 pumps without one block <person player="jamari lattimore" race="UNK" position="LB">lattimore</person> comes up with the big play to flip the field the timing on that was pretty good in terms of getting a punt off you like to do it in under two seconds that was one point eight and trying to get the punt off just a breakdown in the protection <person player="seneca wallace" race="nonwhite" position="QB">wallace</person> takes over at the 32 is vulnerable different types of roles that a to bag scheme run and they completely fooled this young line backing for the chicago bears coon is going to line back for <person player="james anderson" race="nonwhite" position="LB">james anderson</person> there s a poor run fifth and <person player="james starks" race="UNK" position="RB">james starks</person> guesses that chicago bears number 47 <person player="christopher conte" race="UNK" position="DB">conte</person> s got to step up and make this tackle that s what safety sure paid to do starch who played only three games in that rookie season in 2010 during the regular season that that sensational playoff run for the been injured through his career including a partially torn mcl ligament to me earlier this year he s back with a vengeance packers on top by three quite a start here in lambeau ranking like its fenway middle the fitting sweet caroline plays here weve had the face of the franchise quarterback get hurt blocked punt a couple of touchdowns bill walker da de <person player="dante rosario" race="nonwhite" position="TE">rosario</person> number 88 on the left side of the bears punt protection has the fan out there in block number 57 <person player="jamari lattimore" race="UNK" position="LB">jamari lattimore</person> breakdown in your

battle of backups in lambeau cosmic ganges at <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">matt forte</person> that s a loss of three in john the defense is picking it up here in the

game maybe even lost the halfyard <person player="morgan burnett" race="nonwhite" position="DB">morgan burnett</person> from the safety spot capped it off an area where the packers have struggled this year the red zone defense you see it last in the league and i tried to tell you earlier running the ball against these mammoth green bay packers is a difficult thing to do so chicago is going to spread them out on the oneyard line deny another way to get it in there what s this football every week now youre the one hey give me five wide spread it out and throw it straight to the right oh god jeffrey bottom of the screen we options right there no right inside of <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">forte</person> steps through the end zone touchdown is a nice

football for the chicago bears they put over 40 points on the board last week at <person player="cornelius washington" race="nonwhite" position="LB">washington</person> and a loss and they have moved the ball very well tonight you see matt cavanaugh the quarterback coach there s a lot of good stuff going on right now with <person player="josh mccown" race="white" position="QB">josh mccown</person> and his bears offense remember he didnt take a rep mike the first six or seven weeks of the season because <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">jay cutler</person> took every one of

officially calling it you see them looking up inside that shoulder area out by the collarbone left collarbone injury out for the rest of the game and who knows what that means going forward how significant the injury is how <person player="kyle long" race="white" position="OG">long</person> it is again the backup quarterback has been something at green bay <person player="kyle long" race="white" position="OG">long</person> known for drafting and developing young quarterbacks just has not been able to find since that flint left here candidly over the last couple of years and now

position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> disappears for this <person player="kyle long" race="white" position="OG">long</person> of a period i think this injury is a little bit more serious maybe than we think mike and <person player="seneca wallace" race="nonwhite" position="QB">seneca wallace</person> has his hands full not only in this game but green bay i dont know who the emergency quarterback is that s what i want to know what happens if something were to happen to <person player="seneca wallace" race="nonwhite" position="QB">seneca</person> we got a lot of guys either <person player="chris

little push and crack right here in charleston on the right corner for the bears reads it and makes a tackle he s had over a hundred tackles twice in his career he does it all for chicago a turnover creating machine but also an outstanding tackler for a corner battling zone injury since week three inflammation of the right knee it s just how many snaps can they keep him on the field third and ten for <person player="seneca wallace" race="nonwhite" position="QB">seneca wallace</person> the <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">jordy nelson</person> hemmed in there and not

<person player="devin hester" race="nonwhite" position="DB">hester</person> some route to return but he says get away from this one takes a good bounce in match day and theyll pin chicago inside the 15yard line their start their own 13 in the lead no <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> is done for the night back here in green bay and certainly the

position="LB">matthews</person> out he got the pins out of his thumb the surgery that he had a month ago pins came out today theyre hoping to get him back soon but massa <person player="aaron rodgers"

it s playing some of his better football this year and certainly a leader for this green bay team very unselfish they took him out in their sub defense a couple years ago now he plays every down but when youre asked to take a pay cut some guys get sensitive they want to leave and go someplace else but a jayhawk is continued to be a consistent every day every down leader for this patch of organization they said a lot of different linebackers around of including any balumbo had to come in rookie out of eastern michigan undrafted free agent who s in because the injuries to <person

position="QB">wallace</person> 511 shorter quarterback run around do some things and it s been a while so as a coach when you know the guy hasnt played in a game since 2011 do you try to let him just get back to game tempo by giving him some runs and some quick sauces i think he give him a couple series but there is a <person player="seneca wallace" race="nonwhite" position="QB">seneca wallace</person> is here is he is a great competitor and he just has an era confidence about him you got to trust them that s why he s here the lemon is throw his short for <person player="james

<person player="morgan burnett" race="nonwhite" position="DB">morgan burnett</person> in on the tackle you know quarterback pretty well from rich gannon who reminds some of <person player="josh

defense he s got a lot of rich gain and like qualities and marc trestman and <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron</person> : on the bears staff or whiff ganic your assistants in auckland first when you were there and then bill callahan following you at the 25 <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">forte</person> with a nice room in space as <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">matt forte</person> gained 17 yards and the bears offense is ruined here in this first half getting a shotgun you get your passing game going you start to get the pass rush going up the field why not run a draw play just an inside handoff the <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">forte</person> you see <person player="jamari lattimore" race="UNK" position="LB">jamari lattimore</person> number 57 get caught up in the wash good north/south elusiveness by <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite"

<person player="michael bush" race="nonwhite" position="RB">michael bush</person> a jayhawk with the tackle and its second time fox helmet has come off has pushed lower the shoulder and moved forward

player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron</person> cromer all go special marshall down the seen right across the free safety s face in a ball small and accurately but a lot of this offense looks like what <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron</person> cromer the offensive coordinator and at orleans on the first down the sidelines though <person

cutler</person> getting in it with demarcus webbys other offensive lineman couldnt protect him very difference theyre different cats but a very different story in terms of protection here tonight no question and look for dom capers the blitz here they get some kind of pressure after coming off the edge <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">forte</person> tries to run but vlad amor is there for the stop virtually no gain 37 seconds left they chose to run not using that last timeout it s third and 10 down this buyer beware if you blitz the chicago bears offense youre going to have single coverage for marshall and jeffries two big receivers during 10 20 seconds left mchale stranded lookie now taking over the first anymore but here to the 10 him from behind 12 seconds they should take the timeout let s see trying to get the timeout finally gets it with 7 seconds remaining so theyll have a chance if they choose for one play from the 6 yard line winner scramble by the count of 20 yards seven seconds left no timeouts you have tried to do what 3step drop throw a double slant to the top of the screen completer and complete do not scramble drives starting at the 1 then the bears get 6 mchale look at growing endzone for jeffries overthrown overhead with great public suits the monty williams of the 2 seconds left with <person player="robbie gould" race="white" position="K">robbie gould</person> will come out and try to give chicago 7 point lead and an excellent drive by the bears but mchale put the ball up for your big receiver give him a chance to go play it i was holding my breath there i thought josh held the ball a little bit too <person player="kyle long" race="white" position="OG">long</person> let s see if <person player="robbie gould" race="white" position="K">robbie gould</person> can send the bears to the locker room with a 7 point when a four yard field goal attempt they drive it down the field from their own wall you get three and the bears take the lead to the locker room when theyll get the ball to start the third quarter so mike mccarthy without his starting quarterback <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> takes his team in to try to come up with a game plan now the packers will move forward from this half and beyond 1710 bears here s chris berman of the toyota halftime let s see if <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">rodgers</person> is okay great and set for the second half or our neighborhood just block the two away as you walk around lambeau field here in green bay packers and the bears step to the third quarter 1710 chicago mike tirico john bruton will hear from police assaulters on the sidelines in a little bit the injury to <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> so significant john for the packers obviously for the rest of the night we have no idea where well go going forward with this injury that the packers are terming for now a left shoulder injury happening on the opening drive is shane mcclelland second but theyre trying to hold it together and stay in this game shortterm and who knows when the impact of the non throwing shoulder might be as <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">rodgers</person> walked up the tunnel and he because hell the resignation body language and everything else as he went off there yeah there s a lot of concern and if it wasnt serious hed be back out here playing that s how tough <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> is if there s one irreplaceable quarterback in this league <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> is one of them there is that small group of those elite quarterbacks who do so much as we were talking preparing for the game mike mccarthy s run game <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">rodgers</person> has become so good about picking up the right run at the right time and that changes the dynamic of everything theyve done here you could fill some of the holes of the injuries theyve had but not that one well in the last 340 games all ive seen is <person player="brett goode" race="white" position="LS">brett</person> favre and <person player="aaron rodgers"

run fit off the right side second time tonight chicago has a terrible run entry <person player="major wright" race="UNK" position="DB">major</person> right the strong safety terribly out of position and <person player="eddie lacy" race="nonwhite" position="RB">eddie lacy</person> is off to the races but that s bad defense by the chicago bears winner in an eightman front the strong safety is unblocked and he have two defenders in the same death 56 yard run the longest of his rookie season he s over hundred yards now will he take it in from the 1 laci green big hacker touchdown that s impressive <person player="eddie lacy" race="nonwhite" position="RB">eddie lacy</person> is giving green bay something they havent had in a <person player="kyle long" race="white" position="OG">long</person> time but on both of these <person player="kyle long" race="white" position="OG">long</person> runs one by james starts at one by <person player="eddie lacy" race="nonwhite"

about oneplay seven seconds starts two plays 53 yards on the ground it s amazing the complexion of this packer football team how it s changed without <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> and this presence of <person player="eddie lacy" race="nonwhite" position="RB">eddie lacy</person> has really excited this packer offensive line they love coming off the ball and run blocking look john it s a problem theyve had for a while they have searched trying to find a way to bounce again it might mccarthy western pennsylvania routes loves to line up and run the ball but obviously west coast offense <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">rodgers</person> is your trigger you had the great receivers like jennings driver milt s an emergent philly so you throw it all over but he s always wise they werent green bay december would be everett better be able to line it up and run and they went drafted two backs this year jonathan

side <person player="kyle long" race="white" position="OG">long</person> and <person player="jordan mills" race="nonwhite" position="OT">mills</person> the draft picks on the right side first rather than a fifth rounder and a huge improvement well coach the penguins inside with the stop <person player="bj raji" race="nonwhite" position="DT">bj raji</person> is set a tone here in the second half the most interesting of that group i think his pal along number 75 their firstround draft choice he only played five games in oregon he was playing baseball we know his dad great how he <person player="kyle long" race="white" position="OG">long</person> his brother plays for the rams decided he wanted flat water to play football went to saddleback junior college and here he is a firstround draft choice and he has shown tremendous improvement in a short period of time credit to him stay board games for the bears than he did at are you putting college pressure on from the edge it s picked up and the counter was complete it is all shaun jeffrey for 35 yard line first down bears gain of 15 look at his passport xe i mean this right guard is a rookie he s just learning how to get in his stance and he s pass protected a very good inside rusher gives mchale plenty of time nice finish by <person player="roberto garza" race="white" position="C">garza</person> that s a much improved unit

orleans remember with all the bounty gate suspensions and everything else that happened with sean payton until fit cromer stepped in as the first of the two interim coaches last year and came here to be the offensive line coach and the coordinator for tristan yeah he does a lot of work with the running game obviously hell call a lot of those runs very involved in pass protection he works in concert with marc trestman and it s quite a battery they have in chicago second and ten <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">forte</person> comes to the left marshall grew a lot to get to space and get to the 40yard line so itll be third and five coupler it should have been a dead play right there let s see if marshalls okay he s gonna be a slot blitz right off the left side marshall chased it tried to block and it s the second time ive seen marshall go down tonight it s involved there with sherman williams and as he trips back over williams in pain injury timeout to seeing while we were in break as <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> returned to the field back there since the first drive when he went down to shay mcclellan sax and rogers returns it s the great <person player="david bass" race="nonwhite" position="DE">bass</person> sideline in the interim <person player="brandon marshall" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brandon marshall</person> flipped off mostly under his own power the good news is he s on the sidelines of the bears without any of the athletic trainers looking at him still fighting pain third and four for mechanic chicago nobody flinched when <person player="mike neal" race="UNK" position="DT">neal</person> came across the line so no penalty draw you trying to get a quick start picked out of there by the rookie tackle <person player="jordan mills" race="nonwhite" position="OT">mills</person> and mccallum throws on the run incompletes trying to get it low to <person player="alshon jeffery" race="nonwhite" position="WR">alshon jeffery</person> that s excellent coverage by the packers secondary they played a lot of mantoman underneath with help over the top that time account is looking for al shean <person player="alshon jeffery" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jeffery</person> and devon house jumps inside he knows he has helped over the top he does an excellent job plastering to his man when mchale scrambles that s excellent work by devon house the pod was hips you to <person player="micah hyde" race="nonwhite" position="DB">micah</person> high to the sideline to keep it away itll end up being a much better kick down at the 18yard line 41 well <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> has been the north star in this division look at the record 24 and 7 and we take the completion percentage around 70 the td diancie ratio and the passer rating which incorporates many of the key stats for the quarterback and is throwing the best in nfl history against division opponents the guys have thrown in a whole bunch 500 attempts so within his division a few have dominated like <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">rodgers</person> has now he s there and we certainly out so tonight we dont know how <person player="kyle long" race="white" position="OG">long</person> are the severity thatll be the story of the next few days and beyond here with the packers <person player="seneca wallace" race="nonwhite" position="QB">wallace</person> is the only other quarterback on the 53man roster scott cozine former wisconsin quarterback who played dad in madison he s on the practice squad but it s policies to win early tonight behind <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">jordy nelson</person> that s what throw <person player="seneca wallace" race="nonwhite" position="QB">seneca</person> has to hit ive been asking for a first down play action pass against this eightman front there it was excellent fake wide open receiver and <person player="seneca wallace" race="nonwhite" position="QB">seneca</person> misses the throw and mike mccarthy knows he s got to be very careful in this field position backed up with <person player="seneca wallace" race="nonwhite" position="QB">seneca wallace</person> second and ten we talked about this often backup quarterbacks dont get a lot of reps during the season why does that happen why dont you get more reps for a number two if he has to come in and save a game like tonight they dont let you practice very <person player="kyle long" race="white" position="OG">long</person> mike and green bay is so specialized on offense it s hard to get one quarterback ready to play let alone two so you try to find a veteran quarterback who can survive with very few reps in mcallen and <person player="seneca wallace" race="nonwhite" position="QB">seneca wallace</person> are here for that reason it is third and six pressure pickup up the middle but <person player="seneca wallace" race="nonwhite" position="QB">wallace</person> has to get rid of it as mcclellan came off the edge in the bears defense responds after seeing green base score in its first two drives of the quarter excellent job by milk tucker youre gonna see a double a gap blitz and a blitz by <person player="major wright" race="UNK" position="DB">major</person> right they dont block mcclellan on the right side it creates a horriffic situation for a backup quarterback there s nothing that <person player="seneca wallace" race="nonwhite" position="QB">seneca wallace</person> can do but afford it good call by mel tucker devon <person player="devin hester" race="nonwhite" position="DB">hester</person> s 31st birthday

fulltime returner you be the point fulltime no more offense that experiments done call mine special teams got fresh legs whoops it tips on history of the league in bay 13 chicago none bears last title is one in 85 after winning super bowl after the 2010 season try a little reverse here in the hands outside jeffry unable to pick up the blood as we got to the end strung up i meet palmer s is hung

<person player="cornelius washington" race="nonwhite" position="LB">washington</person> when <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">jay cutler</person> was hurt there you see the numbers in the top line and tonight he s continued his solid slayed mistake 3 again to this point that s impressive i coached his brother as a very good backup quarterback still today with the new orleans saints quite a quarterback family luke s brother just sitting on second and nine here <person player="kyle long" race="white" position="OG">long</person> pick up that pressure to give him account side to throat a marshall complete at the 34yard line john talked about the good offensive line play <person player="kyle long" race="white" position="OG">kyle long</person> gave him that extra second with another inside blitz and <person player="josh mccown" race="white" position="QB">josh mccown</person> shows no fear mike right up the middle across dog blitz watch macau stand here wait for his receiver to get open and in the face of the blitz he throws a strike for a first now that s bigtime order back play and marshall good to see him back running around and read on that last series four yard shy of a hundred were no <person player="roberto garza" race="white" position="C">garza</person> snapped it back macallan supports it with space <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">matt forte</person> force down and out of bounds at the 22 yard <person player="kyle long" race="white" position="OG">long</person> that s a play that <person

it s covered throw the little check down underneath to <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">matt forte</person> i thought marshall got grabbed this will miss the call but you can see <person player="josh mccown" race="white" position="QB">josh mccown</person> going through his progression snap after snap he doesnt look rusty at all this is more than impressive <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">forte</person> running up the middle maybe inside the 22 taken into the redzone at the 17yard line mentioned this is his third year with chicago in

forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">matt forte</person> inside the 10 thurston goals and he jennings tackles him at the six chicago ran his own read last week against the <person player="cornelius washington" race="nonwhite" position="LB">washington</person> redskins and heard him just watch the effect that <person player="josh mccown" race="white" position="QB">mccown</person> has after he hands the ball off on the defense you see number 42 <person player="morgan burnett" race="nonwhite" position="DB">morgan burnett</person> come down an honor <person player="josh mccown" race="white" position="QB">mccown</person> who s carrying out his faith there s a lot of offense in this bear playbook let s see if they can finish the drive they love to throw big receivers and he s to receiver slot combination <person player="dante rosario" race="nonwhite" position="TE">dante</person> were sorry oh the other tight end in as the throw to the ends of the muscle is in completely at a hand on a divided house the corner he was trying to free himself for space well two receivers we called a slot theyre going to try to use jefferies to run interference for marshal davout house quite through the traffic could have been a flag there speaking of which one hit penalty tonight this keep an eye on the isolation to jeffries on the right marshall in the slide if they load the box <person player="josh mccown" race="white" position="QB">mccown</person> to throw it if it s his soft boxer handed at the fort day his tomorrow bennett s over the top and jeffries got the bottom of the screen the count goes that way for al shean jeffrey he s in touchdown chicago they say what s different about the bears red zone offense i said they got some monsters of the midway there s nothing that house can do but kal saw the oneonone coverage throw it up high and lets jeffrey go do what he does best what a throw and catch nothing fancy mike if it s oneonone throw it to one of the monsters if it s a soft box handed off and <person player="josh mccown" race="white" position="QB">josh mccown</person> this through a second touchdown pass jeffrey 63 marshall 64 then stay there <person player="robbie gould" race="white" position="K">robbie gould</person> that s the extra point each monster has to touch down and the barriers are again in the least the valley change here is <person player="josh mccown" race="white" position="QB">mccown</person> to marshal earlier on followed by <person player="josh mccown" race="white" position="QB">mccown</person> this time to <person player="alshon jeffery" race="nonwhite" position="WR">alshon jeffery</person> remember those all set up of a 23hour pumper term by <person player="devin hester" race="nonwhite" position="DB">devin hester</person> the bears back on top it s impressive to talk about catch radius yeah you and i could complete some passes to these guys big their wings he bands i dont know him you and what they all told us including <person player="josh mccown" race="white" position="QB">mccown</person> last night <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">cutler</person> last year when <person player="alshon jeffery" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jeffery</person> was fighting through a rookie season oh some injury was bounced on <person player="alshon jeffery" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jeffery</person> is so polite yes sir no sir doesnt say very much but boy can he make some plays in his emergency this bears offense has made color when he s been healthy and <person player="josh mccown" race="white" position="QB">mccown</person> tonight less reliant on targeting marshall constantly making the better office <person player="micah hyde" race="nonwhite" position="DB">micah hyde</person> stopped cold the 13 <person player="jerry franklin" race="UNK" position="LB">jerry franklin</person> in on the coverage what big terms you dropped it telling you about catch radius that s why we go to the combine we measure their arm size their vertical jump and when you have a wingspan like <person player="brandon marshall" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brandon marshall</person> six foot five you can jump 41 inches you can find the ball there s just not a lot the smaller size defensive back can do and then you have al sean jeffrey that s what im talking about a catch radius you see the radius it s about nine feet high mike booth and <person player="alshon jeffery" race="nonwhite" position="WR">alshon jeffery</person> and <person player="brandon marshall" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brandon marshall</person> theyre impossible to stop and i wouldnt be surprised if bennett doesnt get one before the nights out your tight end <person player="martellus bennett" race="nonwhite" position="TE">martellus bennett</person> pants bed size <person player="eddie lacy" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lacy</person> with a shake on the run <person player="eddie lacy" race="nonwhite" position="RB">eddie lacy</person> is over 100 yards tonight with the run there and john to that point that touchdown talking with these monsters of the midway over to vaughn house that was a 61 quarter it s like a small corner over there when youre that big and you can jump that high you have those type of ball skills you can see why marc trestman has empowered his quarterback whether bk <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">cutler</person> or <person player="josh mccown" race="white" position="QB">josh mccown</person> throw them the ball with the catch <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">jordy nelson</person> to the 35yard line 17yard games missed quiet evening for <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">nelson</person> after the injury to <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">rodgers</person> else is working in a slot more than he ever has mike he s inside he beats fry off the release and it s just a crossing pattern remembered on the driver great slot receiver a truck retired jennings went to minnesota and <person player="randall cobb" race="nonwhite" position="WR">randall cobb</person> is out so not only is <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">jordy nelson</person> had to line up outside he s had to go inside as the slot receiver that says a lot about his versatility <person player="seneca wallace" race="nonwhite" position="QB">wallace</person> out on the edge being perceived by david bastion completes it zou corliss the tight end backtoback passing first downs as we approached the 1minute mark in the third nice job by <person player="seneca wallace" race="nonwhite" position="QB">seneca wallace</person> and mike mccarthy the head coach of the packers has a lot of design moves the pocket patterns in this offense remember that s what <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> does extremely well and i think <person player="seneca wallace" race="nonwhite" position="QB">seneca wallace</person> is going to be very effective with these run actions moving the pocket tenll ac 139 yards rushing tonight led to nevada s <person player="james anderson" race="nonwhite" position="LB">james anderson</person> comes in to make the stop <person player="james anderson" race="nonwhite" position="LB">james anderson</person> <person player="brandon bostick" race="UNK" position="TE">bostick</person> has seen green think about the linebackers weve seen here mike from these chicago bears over the years it s amazing the anonymous core of linebackers were seeing from chicago tonight <person player="lance briggs" race="nonwhite" position="LB">briggs</person> out with the shoulder injury so something that you cant harness because there s a fracture in there he was telling me before the game left to harness it up and go play but cant do it here he s become quite a coach they tell me just walking around with mel tucker he s got his script and a highlighter he s giving these bears everything he can from the sidelines and there s <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> and that s the scariest sight ive seen in a while through three in green bay packers down for driving on monday night football and here at lambeau theyve seen the lead flip five times as we begin the fourth quarter with the packers at midfield and <person player="eddie lacy" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lacy</person> alludes to tackles finally the rest of the bears pursue and limit the game so itll be third about five and a half coming for chicago for green bakes a <person player="major wright" race="UNK" position="DB">major</person> right again coming down as the eighth defender in the box needs to wrap up youll see 21 come down on your right side of the screen that should be a threeyard loss <person player="christopher conte" race="UNK" position="DB">conte</person> and <person player="major wright" race="UNK" position="DB">major</person> right to vetter and safety s got to pick up their play theyre counting on these two men to deliver for chicago this is a mantoman down here mike just one third down conversion for the packers tonight <person player="seneca wallace" race="nonwhite" position="QB">wallace</person> deflected in the air second time a pass has been batted <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">peppers</person> to earlier ended up with an interception off a slant that he was able to bat leer has a good disguise by the bears defense they showed across the board mantoman coverage they bailed out played a three deep tone and although <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">julius peppers</person> hasnt been real effective early in the season he s got a batted pass a sack in and interception and that almost was intercepted maste he aims right with his body and kicks left to try to keep pests away from getting a good run on it and the fair catch signal is <person player="devin hester" race="nonwhite" position="DB">hester</person> lets it go and it s down right around the 10yard line well the story the nfc north if the bears can hang on to this fourth quarter and win at the halfway point everybody will be tied five and three and two and one in the division and where the games will be to decide this division in large part lions go to soldier field on sunday thanksgiving early the annual game at <person player="michael ford" race="UNK" position="RB">ford</person> field is a visit by the packers of a packers and bears close business on week 17 well someone is going to need to make a play for this packer defense <person player="charles tillman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">charles</person> woodson is gone he s in oakland <person player="clay matthews" race="UNK" position="LB">clay matthews</person> isnt playing tonight they need somebody to make a play they have not generated turnovers this year they need one ron stars roots in the county looking to put a screen to <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">forte</person> but rossi sniffed it out when giving <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">forte</person> no space from the cow just threw it in the ground he s a rowdy second time tonight mike you have to read the set of these guards if you senses it s a screen pass you got to get out of your rush mode and go find the screening back that s the second time he s read <person player="matthew slauson" race="UNK" position="OG">slauson</person> and ruins screen passes second in law have to be careful playing man against these big receivers they have hurt green bay with that catch radius theyre forgiving and most of the blunt rotate tries to get to the edge mark super a nice block so these receivers who are blocking in addition to using that catch radius gave <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">forte</person> the edge there in a gain of 14 l <person player="sam shields" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sam shields</person> wants a new contract he s been reluctant to signed got to make the tackle number 37 right there and it s an excellent job by <person player="brandon marshall" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brandon marshall</person> blocking against <person player="casey hayward" race="nonwhite" position="DB">casey</person> heyward on the outside this tackles will kill you but the perimeter blocking of marshall and <person player="alshon jeffery" race="nonwhite" position="WR">alshon jeffery</person> has been a winning edge of this bears football team <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">forte</person> has run for 80 yards tonight like we wont even add a yard to that 180 house on the bottom of the pile ryan tickets out of ohio state been here eight years with the packers all the tackle as chicago s had good balance tonight mike between the run in the passer comes daytona jones the rookie pass rusher out of ucla <person

blitz the linebacker occupies the back and <person player="sam shields" race="nonwhite" position="DB">shields</person> is free it s an excellent disguise it s a famous dom capers blitz of to trap blitz and oldfashioned pittsburgh steeler blitz that he s been running for sets up a huge third down and it looks like a creative blitz again again almost intercepted ramon williams and his hands on one they will punk with 12 and a half remaining good this guy s by green bay they go with the threeman rush maximum zone youre gonna see mchale telegraph this throw he stares down bennett too tight in and truman williams who hasnt had an interception in his last 21 games should had one there ive seen him make that play backers wound up here eight to come after toddlers and <person player="aaron

upstairs in the box and theyre seeing what youre seeing so what do you do with that information well you want to try to get that to mike mccarthy and im sure tom clements mike mccarthy are all on the same page theyre just reluctant to throw the football with the backup quarterback that they really have no history with they havent called any plays ever there was <person player="seneca wallace" race="nonwhite" position="QB">seneca wallace</person> in a game not in the preseason not in a regular season not ever huge third and three <person player="seneca wallace" race="nonwhite" position="QB">wallace</person> chief spy mcclellan and down a sack with <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">julius peppers</person> heard from very little first half of the season for the bears big imprint on this game tonight well it s just going to be a one on one rush on the right side <person player="marshall newhouse" race="nonwhite" position="OT">marshall newhouse</person> against shane mcclelland good spin move good effort that s what they need from their former firstround draft choice but chicago is challenging these packer receivers theyre daring <person player="seneca wallace" race="nonwhite" position="QB">seneca wallace</person> to throw the football green bay s gonna have to throw the ball to win i havent seen him do it go right through the middle nearly a chance to block the punt fair catch signal by <person player="devin hester" race="nonwhite" position="DB">hester</person> back at the 11 yard line <person player="stephen paea" race="nonwhite" position="DT">stephen paea</person> right through the middle and the big defensive tackle didnt lay out at maste here in green bay bit of housekeeping theyve officially credited that sack on third down shane mcclellan he has two including the one that knocked out <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> in the first quarter bears lead by four under ten minutes the backup <person player="josh mccown" race="white" position="QB">josh mccown</person> has let them dwell here tonight <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">forte</person> on the edge for a first down run of a dozen yards and is he quick simple draw play off the right side he bounces it to the outside and it s impressive running by <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">matt forte</person> watch it just a draw play off the right side and <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">forte</person> is going to bounce it outside pick up a block once again from <person player="brandon marshall" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brandon marshall</person> perimeter blocking of the bear receivers has really impressed me the other side lacey s run for 154 take closing in on 193 yards go game there as logan <person player="morgan burnett" race="nonwhite" position="DB">burnett</person> comes up from the safety spot johnson account has done such a good job here tonight and in the <person player="cornelius washington" race="nonwhite" position="LB">washington</person> game he is being report earlier that <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">jay cutler</person> looks like he s amped ants to play next week at home on sunday against the lions they say it s a hundred starts for <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">cutler</person> in his career ten games over 500 his number took the bears including the one playoff win of his career when they beat seattle before losing to the packers in the nfc championship game <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">cutler</person> not under contract for next year although the bears could give him the one year franchise tag you have to make a longterm decision just yet on a rolling throw to the sidelines a marshall out of bounds incomplete step away and i think the bears have a tough call on <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">jay cutler</person> at the end of the year with that contract coming up mike im sure that demands are gonna be huge and marc trestman a new head coach errant cromer a new offensive coordinator theyve got a lot that that think they want to research his see down the stretch it would help him <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">cutler</person> get back out there quickly phil emory lot of people <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">jay cutler</person> in the last two months of this regular season to determine his future third down coming up here third and nine mechanic complete heavy catch and run and <person player="martellus bennett" race="nonwhite" position="TE">martellus bennett</person> gets very close to it it will depend on the spot as bennett is down now popping back up well see where the spot is the marker looked to be right on the 33 yard line what a tremendous effort by <person player="martellus bennett" race="nonwhite" position="TE">martellus bennett</person> and once again it s missed tackles <person player="casey hayward" race="nonwhite" position="DB">casey</person> heyward and that effort to the pylon was impressive by <person player="martellus bennett" race="nonwhite" position="TE">martellus bennett</person> it s third down so here s the look the chains were on that near side the packers side and it is that short wow for just a chain link short 750 left here up for what s <person player="casey hayward" race="nonwhite" position="DB">hayward</person> missed this tackle and bennett knocks three green bay packers backwards i thought the spot was excellent by the official let s see what marc trestman has in mind here mike mccarthy s already done a surprise onside kick im starting to see the special teamer so the bears come out soon they didnt want to give chicago or give green bay the ball that s a 33 yard line bears better be careful they have had some leakage in their punt protection tonight sean slocum the special teams coach of the green bay packers might be apt to come after him the bears have taken this theyve taken a timeout here on this fourth and inches and you keep him in conversation there was the town as tres was looking hey that is play card ive been there before those offensive linemen come up dean say if you dont go for this im really gonna be upset with you coach you got along in your face you got <person player="matthew slauson" race="UNK" position="OG">slauson</person> i mean you havent beat the green bay packers and i dont know when this is an inch you need to keep the football and i like this call go for the win even though theyve got their backup quarterback i like the call im seeing a lot more aggressive calls in the last couple months and i like this call a lot id anticipate a quarterback sneak so green bay and well run it for teh got the first down he had to do some hard running big tent there and they keep the drive going halfway through the fourth hard and running i thought they had <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">forte</person> for a loss what a great effort by the allpurpose <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">matt forte</person> right off the left side i think youre gonna see <person player="matthew slauson" race="UNK" position="OG">slauson</person> or youre going to see the center <person player="roberto garza" race="white" position="C">garza</person> pole nice stiff arm by <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">forte</person> about pulling the center on fourth and inches have a see net it s <person player="roberto garza" race="white" position="C">garza</person> yeah nice bucks and <person player="tony fiammetta" race="white" position="RB">tony</person> fee mehta pulled back out of syracuse drive stays alive as we approach the 7minute mark lag down his <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">forte</person> the 38yard lot it s an illegal motion on the bears will bring us back illegal motion number 17 offense fiveyard penalty still first down go back to marc trestman you know i work with trestman way back in i dont know where but he s been on 12 different teams he s coached in two different countries canada cfls waited his whole life to be a head coach in the national football league here he is with the chicago bears he s had a lot of injuries weve talked about the packer injuries tonight he doesnt have a lot of his best players you got to give him credit for that cuddy call on for ten pitches now first in sistine and <person player="josh mccown" race="white" position="QB">josh mccown</person> throwing sidelines from marshall couldnt hang us it was contacted by <person player="morgan burnett" race="nonwhite" position="DB">morgan burnett</person> at the 12th time marshall has been thrown to tonight for this excuse me mike he s replaced <person player="charles tillman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">charles</person> woodson as the leader of this packers secondary that time he hit wheels and finds marshall and makes a nice play ball hit marshall right in the hands and before he could secure the catch there s <person player="morgan burnett" race="nonwhite" position="DB">morgan burnett</person> got a big contract in the offseason theyre counting on him mike it s the first three games that hamstring injury but his comeback take that leadership role and on capers secondary ii 250 is time from the cow ages dont have the rush right now <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">forte</person> will make it third and manageable itll be snapped under six minutes left here in the fourth that s a good check down by <person player="josh mccown" race="white" position="QB">mccown</person> you can see how marc trestman spaz offense operates were going to use all five eligible receivers and we have one of the best third down backs in football in <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">matt forte</person> and will utilize him underneath as a check down and has been very effective tonight take job <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">forte</person> wants to shoot the bears had some personnel issues with subs they now get their 11th player on the field of play clocks in eight get this off lightly in time but bush is the back met some account on 36 and the count throws complete to marshall at midfield and the bears will take it under five minutes on this drive and macallan is making some money plays yes he is and marshall is just too big and physical on the right side i dont think <person player="casey hayward" race="nonwhite" position="DB">casey</person> heyward can handle <person player="brandon marshall" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brandon marshall</person> in the slot right out of the break the false wont low and inside where marshall can protect himself and the catch and youre right mike mike <person player="josh mccown" race="white" position="QB">josh mccown</person> as taking care of the ball he s managed the clock and he s run a lot of different plays he s been outstanding in relief of <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">jay cutler</person> for plus minutes off the clock so far on this drive and <person player="michael bush" race="nonwhite" position="RB">michael bush</person> as <person player="kyle long" race="white" position="OG">long</person> as from coming into tonight seven yards gaines nine on that carry let s take a look at josh mcconnell forget he had a 20 yard run to set up a field goal at the end of the first half but no interceptions 272 yards passing not a high completion percentage but he s thrown the ball away tonight and he s led the chicago bear offense and his offensive line deserves a huge assist <person player="roberto garza" race="white" position="C">garza</person> <person player="matthew slauson" race="UNK" position="OG">slauson</person> and <person player="kyle long" race="white" position="OG">long</person> played well kept in clean limiting the sats pressure showing off the edge by <person player="casey hayward" race="nonwhite" position="DB">casey</person> heyward but it s a run from <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">forte</person> and was 4:15 left first down for chicago the jump <person player="josh mccown" race="white" position="QB">mccown</person> walked in last night and we talked to him about the opportunity not knowing if <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">cutler</person> would be out a week or two weeks and how well he played against <person player="cornelius washington" race="nonwhite" position="LB">washington</person> and <person player="brandon marshall" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brandon marshall</person> had so many good things to say about him he said you know he he s not a wearing the seed but he has those traits of a captain one of those veteran backups it takes the young receivers to the practice field throws routes with them works on the offense and he s very wellrespected so there s a lot of comfort with the backup quarterback going in and he s showing us why here tonight <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">forte</person> on the toss on the edge <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">forte</person> inside the 30 and <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">matt forte</person> taking it over 100 yards on the night and stays inbounds with three and a half left in regulation <person player="evan smith" race="white" position="OG">evan</person> about the play selection youre gonna fake a jet sweep to hell sean jeffries if youre a linebacker you have to go that way then theyre gonna flip the ball his left hand the <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">forte</person> i guess he flipped it with his right ive never seen that play ever great job by <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">matt forte</person> understanding the situation by staying in bounds this drive john started with 937 left in this fourth quarter and youve seen the bears sort of forced the packers now to start using their timeouts on defense here as <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">forte</person> runs through the 21 and my car if you looking up at the clock im gonna burn one here to 44 on this side the twominute warning and im surprised that chicago has run the ball as well as they have it just looks like picked it <person player="bj raji" race="nonwhite" position="DT">raji</person> running out of gas here the interior of this packer defensive line they played very good run defense until tonight before kay s taking them to taking it to him hear crunch time seven minutes theyve had the ball i packer fans sensing the urgency here trying to get their defense to come up with a stop second and seven well sister back now he gains a couple and mccarthy will let it go all the way down to the twominute warning though they can limit the bears to a field goal and save the timeouts try to tie the game luke <person player="josh mccown" race="white" position="QB">mccown</person> trying to do what few quarterbacks have done here or rather josh mctavish it s a few quarterbacks have done here over the last few years come into lambeau and beat the packers all being an asterisk because of the injury to <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> at the start of this game but <person player="josh mccown" race="white" position="QB">josh mccown</person> is thrown for 272 yards john mentioned a key 20 yard run to marc trestman rush offense has done such a good job on this lengthy drive mike mccarthy s teams the twominute warning faces a huge spot here on third and five trailing by four you have to expect blitz right here from dom capers a run for taemin let s get a couple of blockers pushrod youre a big block and <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">forte</person> gets to the 11 yard line first down with a minute 50 left and marc trestman expected the blitz and he called the perfect play tossed the ball with little crack blocking and pull your left tackle <person player="jermon bushrod" race="nonwhite" position="OT">jermon bushrod</person> the perfect play against an allout blitz and <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">forte</person> once again not only gets the first down but he stays inbounds what s his stiff arm with his right hand i like <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">forte</person> that s a excellent finish and good presence by the veteran back staying in bounds you cant call a better play against an allout blitz then they just did right there mike it s gonna be the most plays on a drive for the bears this year john theyre milking every second of the clock has <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">forte</person> runs to the right inside the 10 to the 5 and he s down to four and now mccarthy uses a timeout with 108 but there is a flag down holy number 83 offense 10yard penalty still first down on the bears and as we saw that is so big because of what it does in terms of the clock penalties inside of five minutes are one of those things that kills what you coaches like to call a fourminute drive when youre trying to run out the clock because it stops the clock it preserves the timeout from mccarthy mccarthy had just gotten ready to signal timeout and when the flag was there it stopped and erases that call timeout take a look at the penalty right here <person player="martellus bennett" race="nonwhite" position="TE">martellus bennett</person> boy ive seen a lot worse than at night so with down repeats at first down but with a stop quadrant 108 run inside the 18 yard line just a few seconds spin off 104 remaining as green bay uses that first time out after the bush carry each team couple timeouts remaining minutes for from the packer offense it s just been waiting hopefully they can get a stop at this nearly nine minute drive continues in his puss running right the 15yard line mccarthy takes his second timeout with 58 seconds remaining and so much of the game will come down to this play then they force a field goal and stay alive this has been a series swept
