quote the team that couldnt be the good team we went out and we did there this is what you pay for this is why you lift the weights on the offseason this is why you do all the running this is why you let the coach chryst you out you dont say anything back because you want the payoff you got the prize that hit us that were trying to get to were not gonna let anybody stand in our way im having a ball i dont worry about it i dont know worried in my life this team is going to the playoffs dallas texas on the final sunday night of the season and the nfc east title is prime for the taking with a win tonight the giants can make good on jim fossils promise and clinch the nfc eight it would also mean homefield advantage throughout the playoffs that has theirs if they can win out good evening everybody im mike patrick it s great to have you with us ever since jim fossils guarantee the giants have been on a roll at won threestraight he took the heat his players responded and now fossil is on the verge of winning his second nfc east title for the cowboys the season has been a disaster topped off by another concussion for <person player="troy aikman" race="white" position="QB">troy aikman</person> which leaves his future very much in down fall and joe you might think the cowboys would be in a huge disadvantage tonight but think about all the upsets today and the giants had better be ready but mike this is a game of matchups and from where im sitting the giants could win them all the giants love to run the football with dana <person player="tiki barber" race="UNK"

collins</person> has given him something they havent had in new york since phil simms a threat at the quarterback position take last week for example against the pittsburgh steelers they didnt feel like they could run the football so what they did is they put it on carries shoulders he went out and responded with 330 yards plus passing ball i think they have to be concerned with more than just the run there s another thing to favor the giants annette s defense are number two in rush defense of national football league as a matter of fact there s only been one this year this gained over 90 guards against the giants and that s eddie george no <person player="troy aikman" race="white" position="QB">troy aikman</person> <person player="anthony wright" race="nonwhite" position="QB">anthony

race="UNK" position="DE">spellman</person> this defensive line banged up so badly hang on let s head headings have been out shuffling a lot of people in there trying to find the right combination hopefully was out there to hold it up you know it s there at <person player="lomas brown" race="nonwhite" position="OT">lomas brown</person> did the labs for the giants rookie at the age of 37 he s the oldest offensive lineman in giant history and that time trying to run to his side it s going to be very difficult to try and get outside of <person player="dexter coakley" race="nonwhite" position="LB">dexter coakley</person> he s their fastest linebacker and if there s one thing you say about these linebackers that <person player="lomas brown" race="nonwhite" position="OT">lomas</person> and the offensive line will have to block is that they all run very well i think the giants will be better off trying to go at them instead of around them certainly the offensive line has been a strength for the giants all either missing his 30 left guard glen carter had arthroscopic surgery on his could be out next week as well but should be back after that <person player="howard cross" race="UNK" position="TE">cross</person> through the cat s across the middle in the devil s territory and it will be a first down at the cowboy 44 ill tell you this is a great throw by <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">kerry collins</person> you talk about getting rid of the ball in their hurry he reads <person player="howard cross" race="UNK" position="TE">cross</person> right watch this watch out fest bang we look to the outside here s crops now back to him it s a first down that s quick and accurate from the ump cam you can see pretty much with <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">kerry</person> saw quick look by <person player="howard cross" race="UNK" position="TE">howard</person> over the middle <person player="howard cross" race="UNK" position="TE">cross</person> the last remaining link to super bowl 25 for the giants out of the id playaction fake the 40 yard line giants with an impressive opening drive one of the things that this offense tries to achieve and jim fossil talked about in this game in particular is to achieve balance they want to play their game you see the way theyve done it in 2000 225 yards game 14 dead last a year ago only a hundred and seventy yards and the key is the quickness with which <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">kerry collins</person> makes a decision to get rid of the football columns with career highs and yards and touchdowns tomber to note the other thing too is when were talking to file somebody say well you know you look at the dallas cowboys worst rushing defense in national football league obviously coach youre gonna run not so he said we are going to do our balanced attack this is exactly we want to do what they think sometimes it s youre better off throwing first to loosen the defense up a little bit so that you cant run the football youre just gonna have to come out and say boom were gonna glad you carry <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">collins</person> would agree with you right now joe is for 441 yards behind camila deep this time <person player="ike hilliard" race="nonwhite" position="WR">hilliard</person> wide open he missed it all man he really face parkes he just left him and he was so open and when college son he just threw the ball too quick he had plenty of time to throw the ball because he often said lyon gave it to him watch this here s <person player="ike hilliard" race="nonwhite" position="WR">hilliard</person> down beside look at philippe <person player="phillippi sparks" race="UNK" position="DB">sparks</person> is number 20 he s not within 10 yards of him and the ball was thrown out of bounds what did he bite on the double move well <person player="dave thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">dave</person> campo it is not gonna what he had hoped the first year 5 and 9 the longtime assistant elevated to the head coax this year barbar on the delight barbers inside the 30yard line where s campos team has been struck by a series of injuries that have really crippled their chances to be that competitive <person player="tiki barber" race="UNK" position="RB">tiki barber</person> has handled the ball so much for this football team the big thing that you have to be concerned with is that you get into a third down situation and <person player="dave thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">dave</person> campos defense and <person player="dave thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">dave</person> made a very big point of this im very concerned about him as a pass receiver that s where we have to be really careful he gets out against the linebacker they have advantage third and seven on the toss no way <person player="ron dixon" race="UNK" position="WR">ron dixon</person> was in the backfield his sub for 5speed couldnt help him get to the corner and hopefully took him out about well they moved t key out to the wing and they bring <person player="ron dixon" race="UNK" position="WR">dixon</person> into the backfield and they try and run a quick toss again i dont think that s the way to attack this defense there you see movement on the inside again <person player="dexter coakley" race="nonwhite" position="LB">dexter coakley</person> manages to run down anything that goes outside the ends brad <person player="joey galloway" race="nonwhite" position="WR">galloway</person> so welcome on the try a field goal has made 12 straight this will be from 45 yards out personally blocked and the giants <person player="brandon noble" race="UNK" position="DT">noble</person> may have been the guy who got a hand the gala s defense holds well be back in a moment when he noted collect brand ennoble were the first real big defensive play of the ball game the blocked field goal joe he gets a real opportunity that s that win number 59 from behind give them a little bit of shove both up in the middle and normal just gets that big arm up inside a petticoat that is called pushing from behind so that you have an opportunity to block a kick just for those people that arent sure what it was theyre sure good effort by that deep <person player="anthony wright" race="nonwhite" position="QB">anthony</person> right the offense his first opportunity one of the great s of all time boy <person player="robert thomas" race="UNK" position="RB">robert thomas</person> number 44 is the pullback that s out in the front just take a look at he gets an outstanding block and then youve got your blockers up in front <person player="larry allen" race="nonwhite" position="OG">larry allen</person> gets out 15 yard pickup here it is look at here boom to the outside and it just follow <person player="larry allen" race="nonwhite" position="OG">larry allen</person> that s what you call a pancake <person player="larry allen" race="nonwhite" position="OG">larry allen</person> named to his sixth consecutive koval

since he became a starter bullets coming right still whoop michael did they pick up this blitz and they brought a safety from nowhere and what the time that <person player="anthony wright" race="nonwhite" position="QB">anthony wright</person> has look at this line of scrimmage just watch everybody is on the line of scrimmage here comes a blitz by showing wins and he never even gets close <person player="james mcknight" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mcknight</person> working on jason c1 gets him to turn his hips and then just breaks that that s a nice job of now getting up the field dont let one man bring you down also you saw <person player="anthony wright" race="nonwhite" position="QB">anthony wright</person> operating from the shotgun now that is not something that troy weights been right but it s something that <person player="anthony wright" race="nonwhite" position="QB">anthony</person> to cut back and held up by mike barrel the middle linebacker i think down here in the red area one of the things you can look for out of <person player="anthony wright" race="nonwhite" position="QB">anthony</person> right because of his mobility he reminds me a lot in his mannerisms of <person player="randall cunningham" race="nonwhite" position="QB">randall cunningham</person> look for him to move around a little maybe the bootleg some play action to get him on the edge of this giant defense does that was his idol and he was a kid after somebody he looked up to i think so it s uncanny how his mannerisms mere awareness good i think his far more developed as a younger player than <person player="randall cunningham" race="nonwhite" position="QB">randall cunningham</person> right so upset in the flat conflicted <person player="wane mcgarity" race="UNK" position="WR">mcgarity</person> and he is inside the new york ten <person player="dave thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">dave thomas</person> took him out of bounds this kid that s it looks brightened at all you know they talked about they wanted to throw it <person player="dave thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">dave thomas</person> if you hear they are right now <person player="dave thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">dave thomas</person> aside wayne mcgirt just hooks up and i mean that s they got about a half a yard to go that s a perfect pass there s nothing i mean there s nothing frankly about this kid i mean he is not frightened at all he is so calm he was so kind to the goal just <person player="brandon short" race="UNK" position="LB">short</person> inches away from his 114 v rushing touchdown if there s one thing that has remained consistent for <person player="dave thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">dave</person> campo this year it has been his offensive line these guys just find a body to get on and then you let emmett run on up inside and <person player="sam garnes" race="UNK" position="DB">sam</person> gorn s even with a shot at him on the right shoulder is not going to stop this great back <person player="emmitt smith" race="nonwhite" position="RB">emmitt smith</person> in his 11th year third alltime and cuts it outside the one thing about emmett s death has have great speed folks and he never did have great speed but what he does have is tremendous balance watch this that was <person player="jessie armstead" race="UNK" position="LB">jessie armstead</person> diving over he just went up in the hole sub there was nothing there and just got himself back down look at his feet just moving get him back to the outside to the open area and the touchdown that s greatness seeder for the point after 7nothing cowboys will be upset foureyes continue the giants open okay being sunday night football is brought to you by

nice return by <person player="ron dixon" race="UNK" position="WR">dixon</person> which will set up the giants with excellent field position and we come back mike zimmer who was elevated to defensive coordinator when <person player="dave thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">dave</person> <person player="dan campbell" race="UNK" position="TE">campbell</person> become the hit became the head coach yards per game this year s defense dead last in the nfl yards rush dead last in the nfl the players insisted is hartley mike zimmer s fault and they were really happy last week when the defense played very well to beat the redskins because he has been jerry <person player="cedric jones" race="UNK" position="DE">jones</person> the cowboys owner has even said that zim will be back next year but his responsibilities may be different he once de campo who was strictly the head coach this year to go back to more of a dual role next season to be more involved in the defense well it was also something that <person player="dave thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">dave</person> campo had to figure out this is his first year as a head coach and he said he has to learn and had to learn what his responsibilities in what is time allocation today nice tackle by felipe s parts the former giant you know the one thing about this youre watching the dallas cowboys defense how they go really fast from right to left yeah same thing you look like youre over pursuing <person player="tiki barber" race="UNK" position="RB">tiki barber</person> when he makes his one cut now go back up the field now hambrick number 54 was there but they based marks number 20 and allowed to a spell to make the play but <person player="tiki barber" race="UNK" position="RB">tiki barber</person> ran about 12 yards again picked up three vaughn <person player="ron dixon" race="UNK" position="WR">dixon</person> considers whyd you them to me let s come and not only does he have nowhere to throw the ball joe but he doesnt have any time to do that dog with you when that pocket collapses around you you really do the best job of just getting it out which he did watch the pressure comes on the left side alonso <person player="alonzo spellman" race="UNK" position="DE">spellman</person> just pushes the center right back into his face <person player="dusty zeigler" race="UNK" position="C">dusty</person> ziggler mean ziggler is right back in <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">collins</person> face if you want to mess up a quarterback that close out of the pocket push it back in his face <person player="brad maynard" race="white" position="P">maynard</person> the kick to <person player="wane mcgarity" race="UNK" position="WR">mcgarity</person> he was seventh in the league in punt returns that takes a bounce for the cowboys down by the giants near the 30yard line only a 20 cowboys since 1978 24 different quarterbacks have made their starting their debut against teams that work more than five games or better above 500 the record only 431 gp but the giants are ten and four coming into this <person player="anthony wright" race="nonwhite" position="QB">anthony wright</person> was three for three on the opening series to three different receivers this young man was enjoying a very good career at south carolina before he tore ephesus knee as a junior they changed offenses and he suffered through a oneinten senior year was not drafted but they thought highly of him the pittsburgh when tom donahoe was the personnel man there they signed him worked his way up to number two on the depth chart a season ago and jack <person player="earl riley" race="UNK" position="DB">riley</person> does he s got a real time to heal up here this season after the cutoff he <person player="jackie harris" race="nonwhite" position="TE">harris</person> <person player="jackie harris" race="nonwhite" position="TE">harris</person> to the 45 he breaks a tackle <person player="jessie armstead" race="UNK" position="LB">jessie armstead</person> and that s something you dont see that often what weve seen by two receivers tonight as weve seen them break tackles what the cowboys are getting is theyre getting a lot more yards out of the design of the pass it s only about an eight yard pass now arnstead tries to wrap up <person player="jackie harris" race="nonwhite" position="TE">harris</person> cant and <person player="jackie harris" race="nonwhite" position="TE">jackie harris</person> winds up picking up about ten more yards <person player="jackie harris" race="nonwhite" position="TE">jackie harris</person> was the guy <person player="troy aikman" race="white" position="QB">troy aikman</person> said they had to have when they signed him as a free agent in the offseason said he s the kind of guy you really are able to go to in clutch situations that s this year right to throw again woof lag there was the collation incidental kind <person player="james mcknight" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mcknight</person> and siwon ran gather and <person player="james mcknight" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mcknight</person> certainly didnt think it was incidental well the cowboys said that theyre written they wanted to go after <person player="dave thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">dave thomas</person> but theyre certainly not afraid of <person player="jason sehorn" race="white" position="DB">jason sehorn</person> there s a little quick move out and up and i got to be honest with you that s a good call by the official because c or c horn had the position eric williams on <person player="michael strahan" race="UNK" position="DE">michael strahan</person> and <person player="michael strahan" race="UNK" position="DE">michael strahan</person> said he is the toughest guy he plays against he s also the meanest guys meet i didnt he just wanted keep the legs driving into giant territories of 48 he ran right through <person player="keith hamilton" race="nonwhite" position="DT">keith hamilton</person> and hey <person player="keith hamilton" race="nonwhite" position="DT">keith hamilton</person> is one of the better tackle attackers on his giant defensive line <person player="keith hamilton" race="nonwhite" position="DT">keith hamilton</person> has had a magnificent here a lot of people who think he should have made it to the pro bowl this season eight sacks he s always been a good run stopper inside damn it s gonna leave because he lost his shoe that s the only way you get him out and the rookie <person player="michael wiley" race="UNK" position="RB">michael wiley</person> out of ohio state will come in in his place that a close to his feet let s apply this down thomas was riding <person player="wane mcgarity" race="UNK" position="WR">mcgarity</person> out there and it may be a whole and this will be a first down for the cowboys this ball is thrown nowhere near the receiver olli number 41 defense fiveyard penalty a passenger for instance is after me holding just take a look at <person player="dave thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">dave thomas</person> now he grabs him right there and in a legal check after five guards when everyone are caught but it is a fiveyard penalty i mean a holding penalty which is automatic for his death that s a good call it has been all cowboys in a rapidly moving first quarter stutter step decimal little room he s down to and the dallas cowboys are leading this game seven to nothing and they have the ball again in giants territory as we hit the end of the first quarter in texas seven up in dallas if you just joined us we may have another upset in the making on an upset sunday in the nfl the cowboys on top of the giants and <person player="anthony wright" race="nonwhite" position="QB">anthony wright</person> has been the leader so far four out of five 59 yards has shown no hesitation no nervousness whatsoever good protection down complete that one nearly picked off there s a marker down john williams had a shot at the interception that will check the penalty tom white the referee and this will go against the giant just maybe <person player="dave thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">dave thomas</person> again illegal contact number 58 he pants that s a fiveyard penalty 10 automatic first down mike <person player="micheal barrow" race="UNK" position="LB">barrow</person> the middle linebacker michael <person player="micheal barrow" race="UNK" position="LB">barrow</person> patrolling the middle of the defense you see him drop that yep you cant do that he s too far past the receiver comes across in that shallow zone actually it was not 58 it was 98 <person player="jessie armstead" race="UNK" position="LB">jessie armstead</person> he winds up pushing <person player="jason tucker" race="UNK" position="WR">jason tucker</person> <person player="jessie armstead" race="UNK" position="LB">armstead</person> just named his fourth consecutive pro bowl i got a hung them up they pull off the right side emmett to the 26 it s a special saturday night edition of the on espn next week as eric folds in the buffalo bills head to the pacific northwest to meet ricky watters and the seattle seahawks coverage begins at 7:30 with the nfl tonight when <person player="anthony wright" race="nonwhite" position="QB">anthony wright</person> came into the game last week he turned admin <person player="emmitt smith" race="nonwhite" position="RB">smith</person> and said look i need i think he just did it again he turned around and looked back at him again well we asked him what he would say this week and he someone tell emmett ill be there for you the toss nothing but blue in front of them he goes down for a twoyard loss only three men in the history of this game have ever rushed 15,000 yards in their career you are looking at number three alltime he s closing in on <person player="barry cantrell" race="UNK" position="P">barry</person> sanders and walter payton is a less than 1,600 yards ahead of and that last play was going to be a reverse but emmet s saw that the defense had penetrated so much he didnt even try and make the handoff to <person player="wane mcgarity" race="UNK" position="WR">mcgarity</person> he just kept second he s 12 after the loss in complete <person player="wane mcgarity" race="UNK" position="WR">mcgarity</person> ghana he you know what i really i like the way the offensive coordinator is calling this football game he s just letting this kid cut it loose and youre absolutely right joe theyre working on <person player="dave thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">dave thomas</person> again here it is take a look at the outside <person player="wane mcgarity" race="UNK" position="WR">mcgarity</person> again in this ball this ball is really thrown out the only place that <person player="wane mcgarity" race="UNK" position="WR">mcgarity</person> could have caught it if it goes to the inside that might have been picked up but look where he throws his ball back to the outside it would have been a tremendous catch but it was the right place to throw it the rookie <person player="michael wiley" race="UNK" position="RB">wiley</person> checks into the backfield <person player="jason tucker" race="UNK" position="WR">jason tucker</person> dashing out there while see horn was right there that s a loss of a yard <person player="emmanuel mcdaniel" race="UNK" position="DB">mcdaniel</person> was also in on this beautifully defense by the giants one of the things you tell a young quarterback is look protect field position if we have an opportunity at a field goal dont take a sack and dont try and throw it down the field and force anything <person player="tim seder" race="UNK" position="K">tim</person> cedar has made 23 this year he s on to try one from 46 yards out finish school in 97 to the high school job as a fit as phys ed instructor and a coach and has found himself pursuing his dream and making 46 the cowboys with nothing to play for but bride taking it to the giants nfl two months ago in new york you can find a lot of people who wanted to run jim fossil out of town but since the guarantee of a threegame winning streak chance to run up the fc nfc east title tonight everybody jim fossils the greatest thing since sliced bread well you know the one thing i really loved about him is when he said he s when i went into a training camp in the presses and i mean i didnt care about my job dont threaten me with my job i know the spirit i have and when he did what he did he did it because he knew the players were gonna fact might pick the timing i think was so good he did it when they lost to detroit he felt like his football team needed to get shaken up there was a lot of controversy around <person player="larry allen" race="nonwhite" position="OG">larry</person> mcduff the special teams coach so what he basically did he said hey look im going to take all the heat off this football team put it on you psychologically brilliant jim fossil somebody referred to him as mr rodgers as coach did not like that at all and it seems as the season goes along jim fossil has made more pointed statements man i think he s more like <person player="ron stone" race="nonwhite" position="OG">stone</person> cold steve austin right now he s just taking everybody on dont matter who they say or what they say this week he wouldnt let his assistant coaches his coordinators talk to the media what did what he did with that guaranteed joe was give people the ammunition that if they wanted to get rid of him and the promise didnt wasnt fulfilled that was the ammo on who knew after two here s jim fossil on his life after that guarantee im having a ball i dont worry about anything i dont have a worry in my life everybody always thought well i came into the season my jobs in the life never fazed me never i never thought about it all i thought about is making this team play to their capabilities and theyre doing it right now gotta like jim fossil he said his he knew his team would respond to that guarantee and boy have they those offense is going to have to do a better job than theyve done so part of it displaying the <person player="tiki barber" race="UNK" position="RB">barber</person> makes a couple of tackles <person player="tiki barber" race="UNK" position="RB">tiki barber</person> to the 36yard line what a something was this is all <person player="tiki barber" race="UNK" position="RB">tiki</person> i mean this was a sensational run by <person player="tiki barber" race="UNK" position="RB">tiki barber</person> he s having a great year the screen was set out to the outside you got to do something to loosen up these linebackers he s number 21 this <person player="tiki barber" race="UNK" position="RB">tiki barber</person> watch this damn great vision back to the inside now he picks up a block by pedigree number 77 downfield and he s the romani tumor down is trying to help out that was a nice pickup by taking caught more than 60 balls this year russ over 800 yards he s going to remember <person player="ike hilliard" race="nonwhite" position="WR">hilliard</person> on the quick out mcneal makes the tackle at the 30 and he is just set a giant record for a purpose yards which includes punt and kickoff returns 1842 and purpose yards you want to pick out an mvp of this football game without question it s <person player="tiki barber" race="UNK" position="RB">tiki barber</person> because he does so much and really when you look at the running aspect of his rest for eight hundred and fifty five yards but so far this year he hasnt carried a ball more than 20 times gabon crashed down from the spot well one thing that everybody knows and the giant told us this when running gets in the backfield he s going to carry the ball and when he carries the ball no one blocks a cuban so heaven these are a coupon comes down the line of scrimmage what s it look at this feat knows ron danes getting the ball the buddy blossom got it were loss remedies are said he loves zimmer as defensive coach loves campo and it hurt that we want they want trying to make a tuna roe and again a little went dead number 77 all star number 77 up and refer to the fiveyard penalty number one draft was a year ago the giants not playing their style of football right theyre making too many mistakes on both sides of the ball that s the way they they havent gotten here doing this there are a rhythm offense in and out of the huddle quickly theyre out of sync right now scrimmage getting place called in a rhythm that theyre comfortable with jerry <person player="cedric jones" race="UNK" position="DE">jones</person> cowboys 10nothing cowboys over the giant second quarter giants now have the ball at the 35 on that cowboy defense has given up only nine worse against the rush enjoy you said the giants are out of sync these are the guys that put them out of sync the dallas cowboy defense in the shotgun the coverage <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">collins</person> has not been sharp so far tonight well he missed the opportunity in the first quarter when he had it and out and up this one he just airmails out way to the right and jim fossil sends on the punt team trying to get field position you have to keep it to a corner here dont you paul i mean there s no way you can kick this in the endzone from the 35 pick it out of bounds to his left a very good inside the 22 we said that you said it was there normally a very good inside the 20 kicker and the jinx strikes again the punt of 18yard for brad boehner in a world its overhead shots provided by the yahoo sports aerial cam high above dallas texas remarked the punt of <person player="brad maynard" race="white" position="P">brad maynard</person> is now officially eight yards and dallas takes over 227 thomas to pull back with a rare killing you know yesterday we talked to <person player="michael strahan" race="UNK" position="DE">michael strahan</person> and he said he loves to play against eric williams he said he s the best offense attacked in the game he says and i like to go up against the best he s not only fun to the song he said he s one of the meanest and this has not been good for <person player="michael strahan" race="UNK" position="DE">michael strahan</person> directly in 279 <person player="michael strahan" race="UNK" position="DE">michael strahan</person> is im teaching and watch how close he gets to the quarterback i dont think so put the blinder growling falls on williams is a fourtime pro bowler a real mauler inside considered retirement the whole decision right the way at the last moment by <person player="jason sehorn" race="white" position="DB">sehorn</person> and there is a marker down back where right was roughing the passer but id say if penalties have gotten these guys in a lot of trouble sal roughing the passer number 49 pushed the quarterback to the ground first ounce is 41 not 49 <person player="dave thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">dave thomas</person> the corner i dont understand when a quarterback breaks the pocket and he has the threat of being a runner when he gets pushed to the ground they call that roughing to me that there s got to be a different interpretation i mean all he does is run into him push him down that in my opinion is not roughing the quarterback well he got like a threestep run that running into a maybe roughing up inside but another person mistake for your time itself a couple kalen football pole action for you next sunday night at 8:30 eastern george welsh in his final game as the head coach at the university of virginia will battle jim donnan his final game to georgia in the jeep a wahoo ball known george welsh for a long time and it was very difficult for him to retire the university of virginia football program was in the dumper when george wells took over and he s done a brilliant job throughout his career on saturday next week playaction throws incomplete behind <person player="jackie harris" race="nonwhite" position="TE">harris</person> you know something joseph in the first quarter you talking about you want to get to a quarterback and disrupting get some penetration well you want to talk about some penetration <person player="keith hamilton" race="nonwhite" position="DT">keith hamilton</person> number 75 just take a look and here comes some penetration he penetrates all the way into the back into the backfield into the quarterback <person player="jackie harris" race="nonwhite" position="TE">jackie harris</person> drops the ball and <person player="jessie armstead" race="UNK" position="LB">jessie armstead</person> almost had a shot at did you see emmett try and block him yeah emmett just sort of like getting to it s like getting away of a freight truck well at least he got in his way 2:09 again 295 while each x in the backfield for dallas on 3rd and 8th dropped at the 35 would have been a first down <person player="jason tucker" race="UNK" position="WR">jason tucker</person> couldnt hold it when <person player="anthony wright" race="nonwhite" position="QB">anthony wright</person> operates out of the shotgun it is such a it looks like such a comfort zone to him i really like the way he throws the football i mean the cowboys might have something special brings it out over the top makes the throw and you even though the ball is down low a little bit youve got to make that catch youve got to make that catch he got into his body and bounced off that would have been a big first down for dallas mike and more good bounce for the cowboy everything going galaxy s way they have outplayed the new york giants so far they lead it and nothing second quarter from irving tis the season in suburban dallas texas beautifully decorated home there im sure the kids have enjoyed that one thank goodness no snow though this guy does not have time a football game long list gets it out to the 15 and i think theyve got the right guy in the game right now i teach <person player="tiki barber" race="UNK" position="RB">barber</person> against the speed of this dallas defense i think has a better opportunity to pick up yards and make quick cuts than <person player="ron dayne" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ron dayne</person> does it has not been a banner night for either before that carry each had had the ball four times in gained a total of seven yards now we have updated <person player="tiki barber" race="UNK" position="RB">barber</person> he s up to five four i think he gives you the best running opportunity boys defense last juggling catch but taken out of bounds by <person player="darren hambrick" race="nonwhite" position="LB">darren hambrick</person> the leading tackler on this plot i just dont see gary <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">collins</person> as comfortable throwing the football tonight as ive seen him in the past he s missed some throws deep this one here this is a <person player="brandon short" race="UNK" position="LB">short</person> pass out in the flat he fires this one high jinke has to make a terrific catch just to knock it down and get control this guy has become an unquestioned leader on this ball it looks like he is boy pobre the grande ronde consoles he likes to be at the line of scrimmage with 20 seconds league after the language term is over eight seconds six of their hands a cuban out of north you talk about a motor running hecuba never stops in pursuit ninety six comes up the field dane cuts him but look at the pursuit he s on the ground <person player="dimitrius underwood" race="UNK" position="DE">underwood</person> doesnt give <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">collins</person> a chance to throw and then he doesnt quit and a terrible decision by carrie palin s not to unload the football a 14 yard loss which will force <person player="brad maynard" race="white" position="P">maynard</person> to kick out of the end zone the <person player="wane mcgarity" race="UNK" position="WR">mcgarity</person> he is already at the giant bowl of time <person player="brandon short" race="UNK" position="LB">short</person> kick <person player="wane mcgarity" race="UNK" position="WR">mcgarity</person> cant get up there that s the sideways for evany zurich you bond and the dallas defense rising up tonight throwing a shutout at the new york giants rayko tina to find out who s in and who s out log on to nflcom for the complete playoff picture and you will find that nobody has clinched a division title im just gonna say we all should just to figure it out if youre a dallas fan you have to be flexible <person player="randall cunningham" race="nonwhite" position="QB">randall</person> make them know were down to write the rocket <person player="joey galloway" race="nonwhite" position="WR">galloway</person> theyre both that but were down to midnight and they still need to tend to nothing and they have the ball of the giant 44 my hand closed down in a hurry jim fossil not happy with this offensive production so far maybe not happy with us off and anybody in there i mean carrie <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">collins</person> is not making good decisions or close they need him to do that and the offensive line is going to have to do a better job of protecting they need to start making plays and i guarantee you that s what he just told them jim fossils said a couple of weeks ago i dont have the problem putting the hammer down on anybody i also think that their defense is going to have to get after white a little bit <person player="james mcknight" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mcknight</person> gets extra yardage inside the has become the goto widereceiver the injury why not nobody s covering him well he pushes him off up top they push him off push him off he makes the turn you see <person player="emmanuel mcdaniel" race="UNK" position="DB">mcdaniel</person> try and come over make a play but the quarter so far off he s nowhere near okay now <person player="michael strahan" race="UNK" position="DE">michael strahan</person> yeah now there s a tight end blocking on <person player="michael strahan" race="UNK" position="DE">michael strahan</person> and he cant get to the quarterback and calvin first half cuts it back nowhere to go hell lose a couple i think i think foxy he s got a command for now a second down you got to put together a blitz oh then you can navy yard s force a third the long situation make right put the ball in the air and go after him and let your defense try and make a play like that <person player="james mcknight" race="nonwhite" position="WR">james mcknight</person> is hurt number 82 and he s going he s down on the field that s all dallas needs to lose another wide out <person player="james mcknight" race="nonwhite" position="WR">james mcknight</person> just got to his feet off the artificial turf here at texas stadium am it on the run <person player="james mcknight" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mcknight</person> trying to come down and block he actually gets run over by shawn williams to safety literally run over they lost <person player="joey galloway" race="nonwhite" position="WR">galloway</person> at the start of the season if smile went down the rocket is the leading receiver last year and now <person player="james mcknight" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mcknight</person> they have already thrown more balls tonight than they did all last week against the redskins <person player="troy aikman" race="white" position="QB">aikman</person> through three <person player="anthony wright" race="nonwhite" position="QB">anthony</person> why lose another yard let s go to salomon wolf got sally yo mike this we got on for several scouts around the league and they say the book on <person player="anthony wright" race="nonwhite" position="QB">anthony</person> right is that yes great the ability and good arm strength then he he s very competitive they say he s smart and he s a heavy player who knows the nuances of playing the quarterback position i think he s already shown some examples of those abilities tonight remember the cowboys took him on the practice go out a few weeks ago when both the dolphins in chief tried to sign him a weight in dallas off his abilities are no longer secret around the league mike <person player="solomon page" race="UNK" position="OG">solomon</person> he has been very impressive little swing down to the 25yard line goes <person player="michael wiley" race="UNK" position="RB">wiley</person> there s been a battle all night long between eric williams and <person player="michael strahan" race="UNK" position="DE">michael strahan</person> look at this now he goes down to his legs cuts him michael stretch and by doing that he allows <person player="anthony wright" race="nonwhite" position="QB">anthony wright</person> to be able to make a nice easy pass out to <person player="michael wiley" race="UNK" position="RB">wiley</person> in the flat so you know eric great just changing up his technique 10 cedar is on to try from 44 he at a 47yard earlier in the ballgame started to hook and stayed inside the upright the dallas cowboys manhandling the giants well there was a little bit of pressure up the middle but they got the ball up quickly and when you do that there s really no chance for the defensive linemen look at they put him in look at the penetration now will you get your hand up <person player="christian peter" race="UNK" position="DT">christian peter</person> number 99 was the guy that got his hand up but have been a little bit more to the right you might have gotten a piece of yeah but if youre a giants fan you got to stop and think about something because since 1990 theyve only won one game when theyve been down by 12 points or more espn sunday night football is brought in by hewlettpackard in bed new ways to live and work by southwestern bell a member of the sbc global network by heineken it s all about the beer heineken dallas cowboys the giants can clinch the nfc east tonight and would be in control im field advantage oya theyve come back riis down on special teams the first man and he got a lot of help for delts just a moment ago about the giants coming from behind they are not built to do that well they werent built to do work they really werent in the past i dont think they were i think jim fossils football team now has to move up another level now the game really falls at the hands of care ecology last week against pittsburgh that he has the ability to throw the football and throw for a lot of yard as a matter of fact in the 19 games that <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">kerry collins</person> has played he s thrown for 300 yards four times and won three of them he may have to do it again tonight barbara shoved out shy of the 35 we have reached the twominute warning in irving officially at 157 back after this but the half chris berman in the toyota halftime show sportscenter in game the fastest three minutes in television and the packers sweep the vikings is one of the stunning upsets that we had today <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">kerry collins</person> has had a career season with the new york giants this year over 3,000 yards for the first time in his career he had a completion percentage goal of 60% he s at 59 nine throw 19 touchdown pass that s a career high tenth in the nfl and quarterback rating and from the depths from where he came from substance abuse and all the problems that he had i think everybody is happy to jerry <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">collins</person> what an a marketer turns from the and slides in at the 37 he didnt slide past the first down theyre going to be a yard <person player="brandon short" race="UNK" position="LB">short</person> now they cant he cant ground and they do have two timeouts but i dont think he wants to use them up here with a minute and 35 seconds coming up we the first down to keep the let s tip the clock by <person player="pete mitchell" race="white" position="TE">mitchell</person> at the 41 that is the first down i better read tightend out of boston college now theyre moving with some good pace now this is what they need theyd be afraid to throw it in middle <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">collins</person> put it right there and <person player="ike hilliard" race="nonwhite" position="WR">hilliard</person> is his favorite receiver if there s one thing good that resulted out of this play when he bounced it up in the air and did not get intercepted but good protection by the offensive line now watch carries just smoke this one right through his hands i just didnt get him up and get him ready he makes the move inside <person player="greg myers" race="UNK" position="DB">greg myers</person> trying to cover once the screen <person player="tiki barber" race="UNK" position="RB">tiki barber</person> and away from his blocking and did it all by himself larimore made the tackle time out giants monday night countdown tomorrow night at 7:30 eastern mike tirico in the gang review sunday s top stories and bring you the fun it s abc s monday night football ed the temp to battle <person player="chris warren" race="nonwhite" position="RB">warren</person> sapp and a bus remember last year in the nfc championship game we talked about if there s one football team that might be able to play the rams and somebody who can rush for and drop seven that is the team that can do it now that s john lynch were gonna win oh no <person player="mark stepnoski" race="UNK" position="C">mark</person> the onearmed bandit every once awhile he s out the bill he can straighten his arm out it was back okay back in and thrill somebody all i think you were right we said <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">kerry</person> s got to work the middle i still think the cowboys are given him a lot of it s a good place to keep on fire over the middle this time intended for <person player="ike hilliard" race="nonwhite" position="WR">hilliard</person> incomplete williams on the coverage but he went to ask rotten stock giant still with plenty of time 57 seconds on the clock one timeout left yeah you dont abandon the middle at you know and around a minute when you get down about 30 seconds or so you can lay on the reason why sean payton can continue to call place to work the middle is because the cowboys have got their safeties backed up and their corners off <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">collins</person> would get he had <person player="pete mitchell" race="white" position="TE">pete mitchell</person> number 83 going down the middle and he had time to throw the ball all he had to do is wait for him to clear he s got a look at the tight end here comes <person player="pete mitchell" race="white" position="TE">pete mitchell</person> number 83 now watch this boy he wasted it look at look at here once he clears the linebacker that win he s wide open the thing is he s not even close whose wooden ball third and ten hi again intended for <person player="ron dixon" race="UNK" position="WR">dixon</person> i still <person player="izell reese" race="UNK" position="DB">reese</person> the closest defender i think i think carries trying to put too much on the ball i mean this is a case in my opinion of overthrowing every ball he has thrown has sailed on him what s his turn he s open i mean he s open all he has to do is hit him somewhere a reasonable in the numbers but everything is coming out so high and now the giants will have to punt away you just gotta settle down close yards out of it gets another pork it walking toward the 20 past the trunk 22 yards this time paul i think you ought to just try and pooch one what do you think it just with this point he s overhead shots provided by the yahoo sports aerial cam high above dallas texas and texas stadium in the irving now we saw joe down on the field earlier paul talking with <person player="brad maynard" race="white" position="P">brad maynard</person> he s gotten off punts of 8 and 22 yards little sideline coaching going on or ruin the hit you absolutely ruined to get are not going to give me credit for what s going on i had nothing to do with this we talked about christmas shopping well he has kicked a couple of blue midnight as a sprained knee for the cowboys he may not so their top three receivers would be sideline and an exam the three who are left on the active rock here the cowboys you go in at halftime feeling good about what youve done everything youve called is work out your lines blocking very well if youre the giants you got to say okay defensively were doing okay offensively weve got to start making some plays and this cowboy defense will leave the field the last six corners they hammered they have shut out the giants jerry <person player="cedric jones" race="UNK" position="DE">jones</person> has got to be thrilled that s the end of the first half to score dallas birds new york nothing now let s join chris berman for sportscenter in game the toyota halftime show all right michael this halftime show is presented by toyota more choices better selection experience toyota today the muchmaligned dallas defense throwing a shutout of the giants back for the second half after this dennis this team is going to the playoffs we just want to back them up and right now were playing as hard as we can for him and were playing as hard as we can for each other the biggest thing is we got two games left in the regular season and our works not done i mean everybody says well now weve found our way and were playing well now weve got two games to tuffly carrying towns with a perfect str<person player="ike hilliard" race="nonwhite" position="WR">ike hilliard</person> going to go right through his hands uncharacteristic firsthalf mistakes by the new york giants drops penalties missed tackles and they are down 13 nothing to the dallas cowboys well youre talking about the misuse of the giants just take a look at it here s that here s the first one which is a block and field goal they actually had two bad punts this is an eight yard punt and then after the quarterback throws <person player="anthony wright" race="nonwhite" position="QB">anthony</person> way who did ten youre right joe these guys were open did the problem is he s his truck first of all he throws his ball too hard trying to lose that then have control of him i guarantee a gym fossil and sean payton the offensive coordinator sat down with <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">kerry collins</person> said hey look relax the game will come to you jared <person player="jaret holmes" race="UNK" position="K">holmes</person> active tonight because theyve been disappointed with the kickoffs of galilee so he gets off to portland loose ball the giants have it at the 27 <person player="jack golden" race="UNK" position="LB">jack golden</person> the rookie out of oklahoma state with the recovery and perhaps that s the break that the new york giants needed as <person player="jason tucker" race="UNK" position="WR">tucker</person> coughed it up on the return special teams has been something that jim fossil has stressed he s made major changes <person player="jason tucker" race="UNK" position="WR">tucker</person> comes along it s <person player="damon washington" race="UNK" position="RB">damon washington</person> a guy they just added to the roster for special team purposes comes in and makes the play makes the tackle and knocks it away so the giant set up shop at the 26 of the cowboy horrible tisket outside what a play by smart the block and then make the tackle <person player="phillippi sparks" race="UNK" position="DB">sparks</person> and hamrick the line back there i dont you know i dont i dont think that <person player="tiki barber" race="UNK" position="RB">tiki barber</person> would have outrun hamburg either take a look at bleep a <person player="phillippi sparks" race="UNK" position="DB">sparks</person> is on the outside he is trying to block him but you look at him it comes it helps <person player="mark stepnoski" race="UNK" position="C">mark</person> philippe he said just because im a former giant this game isnt special i like i that way right i think this is very special when he playing really the draw moments ago our salmon wilcox had a chance to talk with de campo spied them go to defense performed well last weekend the victory over the redskins getting the shutout in the first out here tonight what adjustments have you made to get this defense turned around id say weve got a lot of young players out there theyre just getting better from week to week the coaches are stressing getting after it playing hard were also getting up feel a little bit harder and a little bit more aggressive and were playing well right now all right <person player="dave thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">dave</person> thanks a lot the suit up after you mike all right <person player="solomon page" race="UNK" position="OG">solomon</person> thanks very much and anybody who has met <person player="dave thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">dave</person> camp oh i think is in his corner they would like him to succeed a very nice guy so were looking at a third weve got third and six i still believe that your best opportunity they go with the little bunch package maybe he got the ball to <person player="pete mitchell" race="white" position="TE">pete mitchell</person> he s a big tight name given opportunity to make a play for you oh oakland was hillier i mean wide open they bring <person player="pete mitchell" race="white" position="TE">mitchell</person> across the middle and then they bring hillier in on meet him and again gary <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">collins</person> just as not throwing the ball well he s in a hurry he s just not comfortable and part of it has to do with the pressure watch from your right to your left that s hillier underneath and <person player="pete mitchell" race="white" position="TE">mitchell</person> in the middle now here s the question should i could have kept on running i think that s what kerri expected him to do instead he s sort of just sat down boy he gets slowed down dala we saw the time from courting he had a 45 conclusive grandal the giants have been a wound tighter than a drum one of the results of jim fossils guaranteed three weeks ago was that his team has been much looser ever since they have played better football tonight <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">kerry collins</person> and the rest of these guys look like theyre playing very very tight some of it has to do with the aggressiveness of the dallas cowboys do theyre just letting it all block certain oh they designed a lot of fun what s coming right no chance and now the dallas defense trying to pick up the pace getting more aggressive <person player="jessie armstead" race="UNK" position="LB">armstead</person> in barrel the linebackers this is what i thought fox had to do john fox and coordinator bring blitzes if you can what theyll do is theyll wind up stopping the run as well but now you cannot let <person player="anthony wright" race="nonwhite" position="QB">anthony wright</person> be as comfortable in the pocket in this half as he was in the first half that s the way john fox was gonna have to set the tone in the this defense and 24 dallas right baba s to snip the giants hammock mike barrel <person player="jessie armstead" race="UNK" position="LB">jessie armstead</person> with the recovery and now are instead going after eric williams he knocked the ball out of his <person player="jessie armstead" race="UNK" position="LB">armstead</person> recovered the fumble got up with the ball he went by eric williams and the big guy slapped down at it and arms dead turned and came after man williams went after him the question is who gets the flag is it the second guy in <person player="keith hamilton" race="nonwhite" position="DT">keith hamilton</person> number 75 was also in the middle of all that he would after well you know there s no boy in between the two oh no another huge break for the giants i think it goes this way it either goes against the cowboys or they go offsetting and the ball remains where it is weve seen the giant special teams create an opportunity now the defense has created an opportunity they cant let this wouldnt go by im not talking about three points either im talking seven you got to put a touchdown on the board that s up to the offense now to step up tom white has the call personal foul unnecessary roughness number 79 so vehicle you concern yourself with the young quarterback is the exchange then freaky ball never gets quite to him you see the ball on the ground <person player="jessie armstead" race="UNK" position="LB">jessie armstead</person> quick to pick it up paul goes rax and goes right through his hands well now the giants had to success of opportunities to right <person player="howard cross" race="UNK" position="TE">cross</person> whoa can the giants make you know i thought <person player="ron dayne" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ron dayne</person> learned something at the beginning of this year that he it really cannot be jumping around he s got to make one cut and go to the hole he doesnt have the quickness and he looks like he hurt his shoulder on that plays right shoulder but he really doesnt have the quickness to be jumping around but you know <person player="greg myers" race="UNK" position="DB">greg myers</person> is also down for the cowboys but with <person player="ron dayne" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ron dayne</person> when you sit down and talk to him he s the type of a player that really might have hit the wall because he s a young college guy it s mayor football oh football oh seasonlong the nfl insider pick up your copy at newsstands net one week to go in the season and only two teams in the nfc have even clinched a playoff berth nobody has won a division the giants were the win tonight win the nfc east that have the advantage to pull home playoffs if they can win out and you got <person player="amani toomer" race="UNK" position="WR">amani toomer</person> up on top hopefully with that tremendous speed that s the third time tonight he chased somebody down <person player="dexter coakley" race="nonwhite" position="LB">dexter coakley</person> saw the hole and filled it and that s what his job is the defensive climb and they take care of the offensive lineman and then you let your linebackers who is a weak side linebacker 52 watch it from the right see the hole he s in it there s just no place for <person player="tiki barber" race="UNK" position="RB">tiki barber</person> to go well at speed i dont care who you are gives these linebackers hopefully in particular youre better off running at him to say it is incomplete and now there is a flag down now there s another fight down about the 12 yard line no long lost between these teams and here s where you cant lose your composure and more flags have come out tom white the referee has got to get control of this football game if he has to start throwing multiple guys out of this thing he s got to try and get more control of this football game because it s turning into a slugfest after every play tell you what this is hard to do but if you are a new york giant player and this game means so much to your ballclub if somebody wants to start slugging you you got to stand there and take it let them throw the fly and fortunately for <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">kerry collins</person> on this ill you know decided throw it winds up being an incompletion almost nearly an interception you want to say that again some guy gonna hit you in the mouth youre gonna let him hit you in the mouth i dont absolutely know that s not how these guys got here here s the throw a cube on again with pressure <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">collins</person> lets this go down is it an interception like if im <person player="dave thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">dave</person> campo im gonna take this opportunity right now to challenge i dont believe this ball hits the ground i think that is an interception boy is that close i dont think it s close i think philippe <person player="phillippi sparks" race="UNK" position="DB">sparks</person> intercepts it it doesnt hit the ground i think youre right that ball does not hit the ground now this is where your your guys upstairs ive got to try and do something really causes it and here s the bonus they get all this time to look at replays because their flags down everywhere so nobody s gonna quick snap the ball this may take just because of the amount of flame there isnt an official in this game that has a flag left in his pocket except the referee we have an incomplete forward pass 26 for now is ejected mosel adam i think they got the number on flow cell is an offensive well unless he came out on the field i mean he may have come off the sidelines all right and i think the challenge is being instituted now but weve got a little bit of housekeeping to go through or dont wait ever well hopefully lols flags that was not the only call on that plot another bag of plain looking at the income nation would not cost the flag no but there are flags from sideline to sideline and <person player="dave thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">dave</person> campo really agitated tennis players get on the sidelines now if this is an incomplete pass and joe i think youre absolutely right this should be overturned that look like a great ploy and this is a challenge for <person player="dave thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">dave</person> campo his guys have nothing at stake and he s got to try and gain some control of them a coupon puts the pressure on <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">collins</person> as he lets it go watch <person player="phillippi sparks" race="UNK" position="DB">sparks</person> see he gets both hands underneath that ball is a good two or three inches off the ground this will be i believe an interception and a heck of one at that ball never touches the ground now one of the officials through the bean bag another one comes in the one right behind there throws to beam back but theyre also saying the whistle blew because they said it was an incomplete pass so the ball could not be advanced from beyond where he hands it but they would get the ball on the 20 on that s wanek that s correct and they are saying it is ebony czar a cuban who was called not flows el <person player="flozell adams" race="nonwhite" position="OT">adams</person> although that s the player they identified for kicking unsportsmanlike conduct that he s gone the only problem is when you say it s going to be in the end zone the touchback i dont know because his momentum brought him back onto the playing field when they would get it that s the way you get with the one foot line you dont get a lot of help when you go to tom white because he is reversed fewer calls than any other official this year 3 of 22 i believe if he looks at the same replays that we do which he does there s no way he cannot overturn this because you can see that <person player="phillippi sparks" race="UNK" position="DB">sparks</person> his hands are above the turf and there s no question watch this that ball doesnt get anywhere near the ground that ball is a good 4 or 5 inches off the ground when he cradles it and comes up with right there again it doesnt skip it doesnt bounce and his hands are between the turf and the ball right there that s a perfect shot of it right there that s the shot that he has to be looking at right there because it shows unfortunately for the giants i believe this will become possession of the dallas cowboys and when he was down if theyre going to blow the whistle which they did he was down in the end zone so they should get it at the 20 the only thing im questioning is does he have control of it in the end zone or when it comes back out here comes the big o coming this is a completed pass first we change i think that is a wonderful job by tom white he got the call right on instant replay they got the call right that he was down in the end zone they move it out to the 20 and then assess the penalty from there i thought he did a terrific job all right number 96 or 70s directive on do you see the kicks right there on the lefthand side in your screen at pedigo he s kicking number 77 yeah well pettigrew s trying to pull him out by his feet also you see pedicle reach in and try and pull him out by his feet and you see him kicking him wait kid listen i agree there s no gray pettigrew is trying to pull him out heat kicks up and there comes to more flag and the way evan e s has been playing absolute i mean he s looking at a career game i almost had his third set he s heating up wellness brand thank you bond will be escorted to the dressing room what got lost in all of this is the dallas defense came up huge again backtoback turnovers deep in their own territory and the new york giants are still shut out the giants started at the 27 after the fumble on the kickoff they started to detent on this drive nothing to show forth were making the announcement everybody gets ejected for dicking eric williams punches <person player="jessie armstead" race="UNK" position="LB">jessie armstead</person> in the mouth but he doesnt get ejected and who s trying to pull him out he s in china get lost i agree you cant kick so you get the ejection but the game that <person player="ebenezer ekuban" race="nonwhite" position="DE">ebenezer</person> was having there s no telling what he s wreaked havoc on <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">kerry collins</person> big sack when they were coming out of their own in chino i dont think she s going to get a recount on this one that s pretty close but the giants have rushed for only 32 yards against the most poorest rush defense in the nfl how about that well you go back and look what they did against steven <person player="thabiti davis" race="UNK" position="WR">davis</person> in the redskins last week and everybody sort of credited that to the fact that the redskins offensive line was in a makeshift position so is the dallas defensive line one missed opportunity after another to the new york giant <person player="jason tucker" race="UNK" position="WR">tucker</person> with the thunder the giants get it galileo had one block then miss fumbles the snap from center an intervention they could be a hit instead theyre still behind 13 when i talk about <person player="dave thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">dave</person> campo getting his team together jim powell s got to get history gain some composure emma excellent job by shawn williams he was at the corner would not be moved and turned it in you know last seven times <person player="emmitt smith" race="nonwhite" position="RB">emmitt smith</person> has carried the ball he s lost four yards that s why i think right here you go you just go deep let him cut it loose and put it up the field because with what john fox is doing for the giants defensively this is going up em it s not getting any are just let them fly let <person player="james mcknight" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mcknight</person> go on up the field against sea horn or thomas back in the ball game coming first down at that 21 perfect throw the <person player="jason tucker" race="UNK" position="WR">tucker</person> boy out say <person player="anthony wright" race="nonwhite" position="QB">anthony</person> right he just stayed in he saw the blitz coming this is an opportunity to see what <person player="anthony wright" race="nonwhite" position="QB">anthony wright</person> sees as he drops back this is from our goal post game max protect emmett s hanging in there to help out he steps up and fires a strike <person player="dave thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">dave thomas</person> has to make the make the tackle narrow comes up the middle they pick him up the big guys do a nice job of blocking and he hangs in the pocket i think about you guys could i speak <person player="anthony wright" race="nonwhite" position="QB">anthony</person> writes terrific kids back to thrill again a little handful this time on the runs those incomplete <person player="james mcknight" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mcknight</person> trying to get back to it his composure is the one thing that has struck me tonight he doesnt seem to be shaken by anything well i had a chance to talk to <person player="kevin lewis" race="UNK" position="LB">kevin</person> gilbride the offensive coordinator of the pittsburgh steelers and <person player="kevin lewis" race="UNK" position="LB">kevin</person> had him last year in training camp and played some preseason he was very high on that and then when there were some changes made in the front office in pittsburgh <person player="anthony wright" race="nonwhite" position="QB">anthony wright</person> was let go they got t martin who they think can be a good football play for him as well but you see felipe and randle talking it over and you know you see a lot of <person player="randall cunningham" race="nonwhite" position="QB">randall cunningham</person> and <person player="anthony wright" race="nonwhite" position="QB">anthony wright</person> i think he was dragged off tries to cut it outside darn nice job and he makes the tassel so the amazing thing about this game the first half there were no turnovers and in the first three minutes and 18 seconds of the second half there been three the giants have lost two straight games two quarterbacks making their nfl s darting debut steve matthews for jacksonville in 97 and ty detmer for philadelphia a 42 13 win against the giants of 19 to 10 win against the giants they beat erickson when he was the starter for tampa bay but a performance is any indication <person player="anthony wright" race="nonwhite" position="QB">anthony wright</person> is trying to make it clear just off the outstretched fingertips of <person player="james mcknight" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mcknight</person> kid throws some lasers up me but the thing i like about he s only 6 1 but i think he plays taller than that the reason i say that is because the delivery of the ball comes out so high that you very seldom seldom see him throw a ball below someone s waist theyre all very catchable and up in the air nor to punt the <person player="tiki barber" race="UNK" position="RB">tiki barber</person> the giant special teams have been much improved since jim foster s guarantee and they could really use it <person player="tiki barber" race="UNK" position="RB">barber</person> is thrilled as he went out about 6yard returned a 42yard punt there is a marker down on the play are they going to say it was a late hit or did someone else get involved afterward guys are really getting chippy out there that s when i think may go on darin hamrick number 54 well <person player="brandon short" race="UNK" position="LB">brandon short</person> number 53 came out with a giant set and he was very happy i agree the coach has got to settle these guys down dont get stupid i mean and most of these families were seeing our just stupid bentley were past that yeah personal foul unnecessary roughness number fiftyfour dallas that s a 15yard penalty daran hamburg with the penalty giants ball when we come back while we were in commercial this is <person player="dave thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">dave</person> campo he s going crazy because he wants deron hammering to stand right beside and hamrick has called for the personal foul hambrick is not coming out of the game they sent joe fountain out to take his place finally on the second try they got him out of the ballgame and campo is just past contact as camello was damn filled with extra copeland id say one thing about this this giant team if they dont do something on this offensive series right now they may just fold man brick is back in gym fossil remember has turned the offensive coordinator a shipment playcalling over his sean payton that s mike zimmer the defensive coordinator he s going to intercept hamrick before he gets to the camp is a good thing that s a tempo we have oh look at that careful bacon on this unnecessary roughness manager his last seven finally completes one and <person player="tiki barber" race="UNK" position="RB">barber</person> will pick up a yard gambits hamrick just tried to kill <person player="tiki barber" race="UNK" position="RB">tiki barber</person> the art the new york giants offensively try very hard to be a disciplined mean sing style of all things the dallas defense has not allowed them to do it and some of the passes that ive seen <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">kerry collins</person> throw here just dont make sense he s throwing him off his back foot that time it was supposed to be a good sleeve out to the left he come that late to keep the bar look at the field position that the giants have in the second half wonderful storage in the ball was quite death posner number 66 joe you said the giants offense hasnt been in sync hasnt been the backstreet boys even though youre right mike and <person player="jason whittle" race="UNK" position="OG">jason whittle</person> is in for <person player="glenn parker" race="white" position="OG">glenn parker</person> play on the left guard position who didnt dress out tonight they hope parker will be back next week you say to me is the most ridiculous play did you want to call youve got third down and 15 and youre going to run your quarterback to the side of the field where you just eliminate threequarters of the field and then try to fire it in and there s more defensive back sir that s insane well i i dont miss i dont necessarily agree with you in that regard i dont mind the play call i might i have a problem with the decision throwing the ball up the field execution wasnt real good either <person player="brad maynard" race="white" position="P">maynard</person> to kick to mcgarry s of the giants three times in a row in dallas territory and they come gary thomasson it looks like dallas is trying to give it away the giants wont take it mcgarrity with the month got it back and dallas will start from its own five the still ahead 13 nothing these overhead shots provided by the yahoo sports aerial cam hiya bo dallas texas we are in irving at texas stadium in what has been a bizarre third quarter still 13 nothing dallas on top of the new york giants throws incomplete yeah giants defense is certainly doing its job well i like the calls that john fox is making he is not going to allow <person player="anthony wright" race="nonwhite" position="QB">anthony wright</person> to get comfortable anymore he saw it in the first half that s the end of it here comes the blitz thirty six is shawn williams he comes up inside and just about manages to take the ball out of his hands i think you just keep on doing it and take your chances that the guys have to make tackles on a mitt if he does run the football lefleur and <person player="jackie harris" race="nonwhite" position="TE">harris</person> are in and the double tight end set than he is thrilled the moment he tufted by saying guards the giants are started at the dallas 27 yard line the senate that s her average starting 27 yard lines they ran ten place with new york giants and no yards at not dayton ppr what jim fossils not very pleased with what he sees i know that what youre talking about you talk about the giants defensive this dallas defense they have shut these guys down holding it let me repeat them they have started at the dallas 27 that average start this at the dallas it s one except you dont do anything right to the end zone again and he got it that s a heck of a play by right and by here let me just say it what youre doing is again youre counting on that fourman rush to go up against one of the better offensive lines and <person player="anthony wright" race="nonwhite" position="QB">anthony wright</person> has the time again theyre in zone parrish comes out of this backfield just a little hesitation <person player="dave thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">dave thomas</person> isnt going to bring down <person player="jackie harris" race="nonwhite" position="TE">jackie harris</person> and joe how about the call here is uh a secondyear quarterback making his first starting nfl theyre just throwing everything out get him kid jack ryan is not treating him like one he s letting him run his football game danah <person player="keith hamilton" race="nonwhite" position="DT">hamilton</person> had him around the ankles made to stop it s a special saturday night edition of the nfl p n next week as eric folds in the buffalo bills head to the pacific northwest to meet ricki waters and the seattle seahawks jeffords begins at 7:30 with the nfl tonight you like fog freezing rain well animal demos in winch all saturday night im assuming paulus made reservations for dinner on friday right again and white was took down the quarterback let s see if it was too late you know you talk about two stupid mistakes <person player="christian peter" race="UNK" position="DT">christian peter</person> this is lamb roughing the passer i think i think now as a player youve got to get to know the officials in a football game and no longer amounts to just going out and playing a game you have to know what officials will laugh we are 15 first down and everybody should learn that tom white is really gonna protect the quarterback he comes in with that helmet he comes in with that helmet right in the chest <person player="christian peter" race="UNK" position="DT">peter</person> manages to get by nails them in the with the head down right in the chest good call but you got to understand what the officials is going to call you know chin to canada in the flat that catch made by the fullback thomas now they will incomplete as <person player="michael strahan" race="UNK" position="DE">michael strahan</person> has gotten to the quarterback unity right tonight and he hit him just as he let go of the ball in the fact and this young man <person player="anthony wright" race="nonwhite" position="QB">anthony wright</person> bounces up here he come beats a tight end look at that bam i mean that s a good that s a good hit now he can get he can get around <person player="dave thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">dave</person> <person player="david lafleur" race="UNK" position="TE">lafleur</person> but he s had a heck of the time with eric williams who is still in the game <person player="michael strahan" race="UNK" position="DE">michael strahan</person> said they became the team after jim fossil made the jerry for <person player="jackie harris" race="nonwhite" position="TE">harris</person> the other thing that <person player="michael strahan" race="UNK" position="DE">strahan</person> said that impressed me he says you know it s so much fun because im on the team now not just a defense for years the giant defensive players had come off the field just glaring at the offense well there ill say once they might be hiring there s an iron tonight because there were in his defense out and but the defense are making a lot of stupid mistakes a lot of stupid penalties that are allowing the dallas cowboys to keep the ball five 21 to go third quarter dallas face asplode intent <person player="michael strahan" race="UNK" position="DE">strahan</person> paves him after <person player="keith hamilton" race="nonwhite" position="DT">keith hamilton</person> made him step up well <person player="keith hamilton" race="nonwhite" position="DT">keith</person> handled <person player="keith hamilton" race="nonwhite" position="DT">hamilton</person> is the guy that makes this play for straight hands fans being blocked on the outside by eric waves but <person player="keith hamilton" race="nonwhite" position="DT">keith hamilton</person> makes <person player="anthony wright" race="nonwhite" position="QB">anthony</person> white step up what there s a stunt and strainin gets by and then bam id give him id give <person player="keith hamilton" race="nonwhite" position="DT">hamilton</person> a half well go back and later punch as the flag dance say is part of the in his tracks and now more pushing and shoving black gay an eligible man downfield for dallas that make him kick it again joab azano infield positions with after 27 all night in the second half number 44 the kicking team was down field it s a five yard penalty replay fourth down <person player="robert thomas" race="UNK" position="RB">robert thomas</person> to fullback and theyll do it again after a five yard walkoff coming up next sportscenter with dan patrick and rich eisen theyll catch you up on the day in sports well have our nfl blitz the sunday conversation with <person player="mario edwards" race="UNK" position="DB">mario</person> lemieux and kobe is on fire for the lakers just got 40 he s on the latest most recent album he is so much he s a special athlete barbar back at the 28 got to the outside <person player="howard cross" race="UNK" position="TE">cross</person> midfield into dallas territory again that s where they played the third gator and the giant defensive doing it ma help from the office every single snap that the new york giants have taken at the third quarters been in dallas territory they started at the dallas 27 mist of louisville they started at the dallas end had a pick they started to dallas building oh boy swivels forward billa 43 nigga never mind or meyer to learn the jackal here cowboy i think i think the giants now have to approach this as really a new game get <person player="tiki barber" race="UNK" position="RB">tiki</person> running the football you dont have to hurt get something out of this drive and you go back and put your defense on the field because it looks like cowboys are gonna struggle offensively unless they can manage a big play in the passing game but get your offense back in rhythm four minutes to go four towards only mittal should have the first down and does a 37 yard line that was actually a fumble dan excusing he s <person player="pete mitchell" race="white" position="TE">mitchell</person> actually fumbled that ball and fortunately it falls down underneath him go get carrie throws alright put me on cam there s the throw now he s still up he s still up that falls out fortunately for the giants it hits his knee and he winds up on top of it now theyre challenging it dallas remember they already challenged one a big one well the thing is is i think <person player="pete mitchell" race="white" position="TE">pete mitchell</person> still had possession so are they challenging the catch that s the only thing they could challenge to say was it a complete or incomplete bad no it s a fumble no but as you said he got it back right save it <person player="dave thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">dave</person> s a little upset because he thinks he got some bogus information thinking maybe that the cowboys had recovered he had a run out on the field pick up that little red flag his buzzers working once he makes the challenge you cant change your mind can you you cant say oh wow i wanted to challenge it but now im not going to flipsie <person player="dave thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">dave</person> trying to make his argument tom white wants no part of it now he s johnny saying i didnt buzz it there s a red flag on the field man it s time you throw the tag either day time i dont know what you do now just fell out of my hand now this is a fumble there s no question the catch is made the ball is out and hambrick but the ball comes this challenge play rolling on the field if this is a fumble recovered by the same player well the reason why he has to do that is because the challenge was made now hell walk over this ought to take literally about five seconds and <person player="thabiti davis" race="UNK" position="WR">davis</person> <person player="thabiti davis" race="UNK" position="WR">davis</person> upset with the information that he got from his bench you know they said it was a fumble but they neglected to tell him that <person player="pete mitchell" race="white" position="TE">mitchell</person> actually recovered there it is right in his hands he s laying right on top of them so this is going to cost alison time out and he was right now is no big deal in a huge insult and <person player="dave thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">dave</person> knows that s what he s really mad at he s mad at this information that he got comes out hamburg did a nice job sticking the right hand in there knocking it out hamburg better because he s so far the doghouse right now <person player="dave thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">dave</person> campo see <person player="dave thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">dave</person> knows come on tom you know what i like the hygienist a lot longer than it needs to be i like that he went over to him and looked down at the buzzer and said she did i really get this how about the 16% the wants it overturned what are you looking at did those the dallas voters or they think so what are you looking at now one remember once he sticks his head under the hood he has 90 seconds oh please okay ready youre in okay let me look at the first replay all right <person player="pete mitchell" race="white" position="TE">mitchell</person> caught the ball okay up to did get knocked out okay <person player="pete mitchell" race="white" position="TE">mitchell</person> fell down you dont have to stay there for 90 seconds okay balls out down <person player="pete mitchell" race="white" position="TE">mitchell</person> has it you see it tucked under his right arm possession giants first and ten from the 37 well weve pretty much beaten that one to death everyone were filling hope now it s up to 19% wants it over turn that s pretty good there must be a lot of empty stuff out there somewhere healing tom white has made his decision all good and in revealing the play this is a fumble subsequently recovered by new york dallas is charged a timeout at this point in the game timeouts are much more precious for the new york giants than they are the dallas cowboys but you never want to throw on a lot good he knows he threw one away the giants came into this game with a chance to win the nfc east and have the advantage for homefield throughout the playoffs if they can win tonight and next week they are in great jeopardy of throwing it away theyre down 13 nothing they have a first down at the dallas 37 they have spent the entire third quarter in dallas jericho with no points but it blows quickly demetrios <person player="dimitrius underwood" race="UNK" position="DE">underwood</person> and <person player="kareem larrimore" race="UNK" position="DB">kareem</person> malarum or the third quarter seems like it started yesterday it actually it s only been hearing for almost an hour 54 minutes i know where those 19 percent came from where philadelphia that s where the 50 percent cant run the ropes claiming it goes said good in six baggage enemies hollandsworth diamond from the intended receiver perrin <person player="darren woodson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">woodson</person> was right there with him <person player="barry cantrell" race="UNK" position="P">barry</person> <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">collins</person> has not had a very good night was throwing the ball in the first half he was dying for 16 but was wild high here in the second half just 6 yard he s 2 for 7 i keep in mind he threw for over 330 yards last week against pittsburgh which i think is a pretty good defense as well one of the best games of his career 24 35 330 the giants just have not challenged cowboy second down too much to win second until this point there was something else coming out i was just amazed and took them that long to try and go up top 33 yards to a money tumor from gary <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">collins</person> boy was this a perfect throw <person player="ryan mcneil" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ryan mcneil</person> number 47 got lost and is dominant as dallas has been in this ball game with the extra point this was the six point game galla lisa cuts the lead to 13 7 the giants white see what happens when you play double zone the safety s got to help out there s the safety right there here s the corner what you can do is youre going to get a guy down the middle and then he s here he s supposed to play back and help either side he doesnt really get it done what he does is you see the safety start outside now he works to

coverage here <person player="jackie harris" race="nonwhite" position="TE">jackie harris</person> inside brian felt pull that s nice he was the defensive end in college he said when they made the transition i didnt know where to go and i didnt know how to get there and they just showed him he could play linebacker now fast learner gives it to emmett and hell get about four the giants against running backs you remember that there s only been one running back this entire year that for 90 yards against a giant and this is what they have done take a look at this now you talk about shutting people down any george but he carried the ball 30 i think it s 35 times to get 125 yards against a giant and those are all thousand yard backs third and nine widely as it as the third down back to rookie and that s going to be in jhansi horn this is the second time theyve gone up top on <person player="jason sehorn" race="white" position="DB">jason sehorn</person> with <person player="james mcknight" race="nonwhite" position="WR">james mcknight</person> the thing is they werent even blitzing this time they let <person player="anthony wright" race="nonwhite" position="QB">anthony</person> sit back there and have a chance to get a good look to put it up down the field if seehorn had gotten his head around he could have easily made a play on the ball but he just ran right into <person player="james mcknight" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mcknight</person> number 31 defense that s a first down what young wide receivers any wide receivers have to understand is you feed people at the line of scrimmage is where you make your route <person player="james mcknight" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mcknight</person> just leaves see horn left in the dust and then jason s got to try and catch up to him and never has a chance to it was an excellent job at the line by <person player="james mcknight" race="nonwhite" position="WR">james mcknight</person> to win on that route a 29 yard penalty what a great year he is had nine sacks now for <person player="keith hamilton" race="nonwhite" position="DT">keith hamilton</person> i mean youve got teeth <person player="keith hamilton" race="nonwhite" position="DT">hamilton</person> he just comes right up the middle look at this teeth <person player="keith hamilton" race="nonwhite" position="DT">hamilton</person> rikki is it is the center he doesnt even get a chance now you see it from the upcam look at this <person player="keith hamilton" race="nonwhite" position="DT">keith hamilton</person> day everybody talked about the excellent job he did as a run stopper he showed a lot of pass rush and flick he is in for the injured night stuff nasty rolling on a roll of the sideline incomplete outofbounds <person player="james mcknight" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mcknight</person> made the catch but couldnt stay on the field this time they dont let <person player="anthony wright" race="nonwhite" position="QB">anthony</person> writes it in the pocket they try and roll him out and push the ball up the field to get see horn to turn does a nice job of throwing on the run as well <person player="james mcknight" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mcknight</person> cant get his other foot down third and 24 dallas see i still i still wouldnt feel like just going zone a chance to sit that back still put pressure lambeth she didnt get it the other sad part about this is the official the time the side that marks it wasnt even there when he goes down now he s foods in the air this is really going to be close but he doesnt make but theyre going for it i love you bet they do yeah i think see this is what i dont understand it s third down in 20 you rushed for everybody drops back in zones and youve got a quarterback that has this type of athletic ability he does a heck of a job selling out to try and make fourth down and and <person player="dave thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">dave</person> <person player="dan campbell" race="UNK" position="TE">campbell</person> wants to use the time now to make sure and they finally see him and ill have one left you know they really they really did the giants of favor because the giants were very late in getting their call in and instead of using a timeout the cowboys accommodated tomorrow night at 7:30 eastern mike tirico and the gang reviews sunday s half stories and pre here s a monday night matchup then at nine it s abc s monday night football and the land to battle warrants at and upon boom oh it s hoho time have your shopping done there at the metroplex thank you jill got all of a shoplifting done earlier working the plants what we have powered failure out of one of the big balls i know and i grabbed this of all great stuff the giants arent careful the lights are going to go out for them tonight fourth in the yard emmit close emma s got it i trust you eagle eye jerry <person player="cedric jones" race="UNK" position="DE">jones</person> down on the sidelines peering where he has said he will spend a lot of time they appear to have it marked inches past our gold first in 10 lakh and they there first down at the giant 36 and that will end the third quarter the cowboys continue to leave new york and hl cowboys 13 to 7 over the giants as we start the fourth quarter in irving absent tonight from the dallas lineup longtime veteran quarterback <person player="troy aikman" race="white" position="QB">troy aikman</person> who suffered a second concussion of the season the 12th or maketh the 11th of his career in high school college and pro his health is in question his future is in question and jerry nick <person player="cedric jones" race="UNK" position="DE">jones</person> knows as well as anybody the direction this football team is going to take is in question right to throw got him again ok hanon hamill i dont know why they just dont do it every down you give him a third and 20 you go zone he picks it up now you start blitzing again huh the only success <person player="michael strahan" race="UNK" position="DE">michael strahan</person> has really had tonight is when he s been on top of the tight end and here he is on the top of the floor and look at him he beats him all around the outside that s his quickness <person player="keith hamilton" race="nonwhite" position="DT">hamilton</person> comes up the middle <person player="keith hamilton" race="nonwhite" position="DT">keith hamilton</person> number 75 against <person player="ben fricke" race="UNK" position="C">fricke</person> again he s got a love playing over the nose you know and this isnt something that the the coaches didnt expect they figured that theyd find the weak point and put the strong guy open second in 19 inside the 45 there are markers down tripping against the cowboys eric williams stomped on the play jumped up and down on it it says i think fossil is going to want to take this and give them put them back even further move them further away from the first down defensive players probably feel fortunate he was just stomping on the flag weve got a quarter to play number 79 offense it s a 10yard penalty second down michael you were talking about troy and i had a chance to visit with him down on the sidelines before the game he felt that his head was clear enough to come back into the game last week against the redskins after the one series but they did really didnt see a point in but he has every intention i believe of coming back and quarterback in his football team next year he s feeling real good he is jewish 7 million bahay namin on march 8 they said to keep him on the roster and a flat a little swing to <person player="wane mcgarity" race="UNK" position="WR">mcgarity</person> let s go to saddle monocots my concerning the new jim <person player="troy aikman" race="white" position="QB">troy aikman</person> i recently spoke with former cowboys quarterback roger staubach who retired after he s even his 15th concussion now roger said he decided to retire based on the recommendation of his doctor and the fact that he was 38 years old at the time he said had he been the same age that troy is right now which is 34 he said well he would have continued to play i then asked roger well what advice would you give your own son if he were faced with the same dilemma roger said i would warn him not to play mike well i can understand that salomon and you go back to the case of steve young nobody wanted to see a guy you admire hurt like trying to scramble taken down by <person player="cedric jones" race="UNK" position="DE">jones</person> he reached the 41 stop back by the way and has been tremendously successful running a commercial real estate company with revenues of about 180 million bucks a year ever since he got out of football troy and it s brilliant it s not money has nothing to do with that but you know just a desire to play joe and you know it s hard to walk away well you talk about roger staubach cnn reported that president bush president elect bush has considered making roger secretary of the navy wouldnt that be something i mean the cabinet is full just rogers a fairly bright guests made us at 10:31 so the giants who have gotten back to it in six points and there s another flag down holy cow it s up to go to plays without a penalty <person player="jack golden" race="UNK" position="LB">jack golden</person> is involved in this one again number 90 and he s really upset senna s against dallas another personal foul theyre in hambrick he s checking is was it please let it not be meet i dont want to have to go face coach campo again that s for personal fouls against dallas personal foul unnecessary roughness number 52 on dallas after the play was over at 15yard penalty first down for new york that s <person player="dexter coakley" race="nonwhite" position="LB">dexter</person> s hopefully for personal fouls and this team is going to the playoffs i wanted to get everybody else off our back everybody was telling us well we couldnt do i knew we could do better and we needed something for his team to rally behind and theyve done it right now the nfc is very open whoever wants to take it we just have to have the attitude that were gonna be the team to take it that were not gonna be the knight and that nfc playoff picture is still wide open only two teams are in nobody has won a division as yet the giants are down by six in this game if they win they clinch the afc because jacksonville across the 30 if youre a giant fan you have to be sitting there wondering how many opportunities can we squander with all this on the line well theyre always saying it s out let s take it let s take it well the defense has been trying to take it and the offense is trying to give it back to him the one thing you hear constantly from this football game which i dont think youve heard in the past from the giants is theyre all talking about team and that s the one thing that jim fossil made a priority was to unify this football team that s why he turned over the offensive coordinator ship to <person player="shaun williams" race="UNK" position="DB">shaun</person> cake second and six <person player="tiki barber" race="UNK" position="RB">barber</person> nailed by myers that fights forward and gets it out to the 35 yard line joe you have been in a lot of these nfc east battles when there was a lot on the line did you notice the giants tighter when we talked to them yesterday i thought they were still pretty loose i thought they were still pretty loose but coming out watching a play tonight i think they i think <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">kerry collins</person> in particular was trying just to be too perfect i think he settled down now the halftime break was good for him he s relaxed a little bit and throwing the ball man in the well get the <person player="mike cherry" race="UNK" position="QB">cherry</person> cuts it outside fights for the yard nice cut by ron dane who has remarkably quick feet for a guy his size but you know something he goes down too easy when people get to his tonight you know i compared him the same kind of feat of jerome bettis but theyre not he s not as powerful he even told us it s a good thing that <person player="dexter coakley" race="nonwhite" position="LB">coakley</person> is trying to grab him by his shirt and doesnt get him by his feet he said the one thing that one of the things that he wants to work on in the offseason is to get his legs even stronger got to place down the question comes in he throws it away smart play by <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">kerry collins</person> they were going to take a shot down the field tom <person player="pete monty" race="UNK" position="LB">monty</person> tumor it s a playaction pass max protect and let imani try and run down the field just a crossing route now he sees carrie scramble he s the only one out in the pattern paul you played on championship teams big games did the guys you had around you did they get tiger did they play better what no invitation we tackle way back i played in six of one when i look at the office i because the all the confidence has his football team is when we sat down with terry <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">collins</person> yesterday he said i am more comfortable than ive ever been in my entire life so what about the pressure of this game we have none every single player that we talk to on this football team and all the confidence in the world not only in the defense but also in the offense at the office for some reason did not show up tonight well but it looks like they have now they still have a chance they got the big play going in in the third quarter this is a big third down conversions to them i think you got to look for the tight end he s been a big part of it <person player="pete mitchell" race="white" position="TE">pete mitchell</person> before the hands of <person player="pete mitchell" race="white" position="TE">mitchell</person> <person player="duane hawthorne" race="UNK" position="DB">hawthorne</person> on the and theyll have to punt it away harry <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">collins</person> went to want to turn in the last time this time he swings out balls just thrown a little bit too far outside again <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">kerry collins</person> has just been that half a step off with his receivers he s hit three of his last 14 and now <person player="brad maynard" race="white" position="P">maynard</person> will punt it away to mcgarrity mcgarrity all the way back to the six cut down at the 11 john williams down on specialty were changing people 9 minutes 49 seconds to go on the ball game dallas will start from its own 12 their only offense of this half has put a pass interference ball the giants have shut them down for a couple with all we have said the giants mistakes carry columns not having a good night all the other stuff that theyve done squandered field position there are only down six points one touchdown wins the game they win the nfc i think for jim s fossils football team this is a critical set of downs because theyre probably going to have three possessions to up would require field goals attempts made one would be a touchdown so their limits there s big getting limited in time and possessions it s coming shawn williams hit in two yards behind the line of scrimmage messi this is something you were talking about this is only a second down play in long yardage but theyre blitzing and therefore i pray you bring us safety up shawn williams is the free safety number 36 watch him right there on the line of scrimmage nobody there to block him he s in the backfield and gets in it when you look at the change in philosophy that the giants defensively have brought on the first four possessions for dallas in the first really worked well counter for 120 yards since they started blitzing theyve had six possessions theyve had just 20 yards build unknown another turnover and the first mistake of the game for <person player="anthony wright" race="nonwhite" position="QB">anthony</person> right it really is an n is a shame <person player="anthony wright" race="nonwhite" position="QB">anthony</person> right has made a marvelous football game for his first start moving down the cowboys his first start in professional football bam emanuel <person player="emmanuel mcdaniel" race="UNK" position="DB">mcdaniel</person> with the sixth interception and john fox just continued to throw some disguises out of he s the inside receiver jumps right in front of mcgarrity but you know something guys if you make your quarterback have to line up and throw on third and ten thirty twenty third and 15 i dont care who we are percentages are not going to go in your favor another huge opportunity for the new york barbar it s awesome speed the tzatziki <person player="tiki barber" race="UNK" position="RB">barber</person> showed speed <person player="kareem larrimore" race="UNK" position="DB">kareem</person> larimore had the third fastest time in the combine this year he can fly and <person player="tiki barber" race="UNK" position="RB">tiki barber</person> left him yeah but you can fly straight ahead you can flash sideways i dont think so watch <person player="tiki barber" race="UNK" position="RB">tiki barber</person> here it comes ridgeland wanna look at 41 he takes us the bad angle to him <person player="tiki barber" race="UNK" position="RB">tiki barber</person> stays it he gets hammered by felipe smart forget that maybe there wasnt already a touchdown well youre right paul the angle is what kills larimore he tries to come in and cut out and get it done the new york football giants have taken over the cowboys gym fossil wood the month ago it s working in the first half the dallas cowboys were nearly perfect no sacks no penalties no turnovers it does come apart at the seams in the second half for sacks they committed six penalties for the personal fouls and theyve had three turnovers and now theyre down by a point and faced with trying to come the room up the middle takes it out to the 29 guess what there s a marker damn no flags are going to be worn out theyre gonna have to be replaced for the final week of the season how the cowboys are getting used to walking backwards because theyre going again it s the seventh penalty of the half against alice so what was good field position is gone number 44 during the return to 10 yards penalty be first down <person player="robert thomas" race="UNK" position="RB">robert thomas</person> coming up next sportscenter dan patrick and rich eisen well bring you uptodate on everything that has gone on in the nfl today staggering upsets <person player="mario edwards" race="UNK" position="DB">mario</person> lemieux is our sunday conversation but we brian continues to tear it up for the lakers man if youre the giants defensively you continue to go after <person player="anthony wright" race="nonwhite" position="QB">anthony wright</person> you dont give them a chance to breathe now theyve gotten after <person player="emmitt smith" race="nonwhite" position="RB">emmitt smith</person> pretty well to his last 13 carries a net two yards cuts it back into the middle a much better effort this time up to the 200 yard line in case you missed the earlier games today kansas city stuck it to denver brett favre lent green bay at minnesota where he had had virtually no success his entire career the lions who everybody wants to count out knocked off the jets cincinnati with a huge win in the snowstorm against jacksonville and indianapolis played brilliantly and let no chance hit in the backfield again williams who was the safety and spent much of the second half of the dallas backfield let s say theyre lying back at an allnight net what i want to show you what theyre doing im gonna give you an idea of the guys at the line of scrimmage what theyre doing is theyre just filling the gaps and filling the boy watch these guys just shoot the gaps everybody s coming <person player="emmitt smith" race="nonwhite" position="RB">emmitt</person> has nowhere to run and then you sprinkle it in just out a left part of your screen here comes shawn williams just a little bit late and there isnt anyone there to pick him up yeah i just really liked the way that john fox is calling this game against <person player="anthony wright" race="nonwhite" position="QB">anthony</person> white i dont necessarily think hed do it against troy a36 that s real fight scream well they put again <person player="jackie harris" race="nonwhite" position="TE">jackie</person> they put <person player="jackie harris" race="nonwhite" position="TE">jackie harris</person>on out on <person player="michael strahan" race="UNK" position="DE">strahan</person> and three times that he s put them out on their spangled straight man has beaten him clean and this is just pure speed youre asking a tight end to block one of the better type of defensive ends in the national football league mcgarrett he actually 83 was out there he didnt even get a piece of and then youre asking <person player="jackie harris" race="nonwhite" position="TE">jackie harris</person> to come out and pick him up i dont think so two and a half sacks for <person player="michael strahan" race="UNK" position="DE">strahan</person> he dies nine and a half the year the giants as a team have five and they are really pounding on dallas will have to punt away barbar on a <person player="brandon short" race="UNK" position="LB">short</person> kick it takes a dallas bounce past midfield stillwall the giant advance has taken over this football game particularly the arm stats in the stray hands from one of the luxury boxes getting to watch in their sons have done a great job tonight stray hands first coach when he was age seven said your son s gonna be a member of the dallas cowboys and those two guys straight hands and <person player="jessie armstead" race="UNK" position="LB">armstead</person> had been the heart and soul of his defense and <person player="jessie armstead" race="UNK" position="LB">armstead</person> up in dallas texas you know what i really like to look at fossil talked if <person player="jessie armstead" race="UNK" position="LB">armstead</person> came to in the summertime and he said look at coach he said what do you want these guys to do whatever you want him to do ill make him do it and he was right we look at this deep well they did it the other night they were going to take everybody to a team movie and jim fossil said who was it going to go couple people started to raise their hint <person player="jessie armstead" race="UNK" position="LB">armstead</person> said put your hand down barbar nice plotkin takes it down to the dallas 44 yard line <person player="ike hilliard" race="nonwhite" position="WR">hilliard</person> baby with a nice block downfield i tell you when things are moving and it s taking this offense a long time to get it moving and a defense i got to move it and then you see wide receivers in wet receivers endlessly we found out really half the block and <person player="ike hilliard" race="nonwhite" position="WR">hilliard</person> number 88 he gets a nice block he s on <person player="larry allen" race="nonwhite" position="OG">larry</person> moore <person player="larry allen" race="nonwhite" position="OG">larry</person> moore just goes at him there he is going to make the screen out you dont always have to knock people over sometimes you just have to get in their face so they cant find the runner that s what michael wants you know it s funny when you see a defensive giant player cheering on the offense it hasnt been that way for years until this year earlier in the third quarter when you said to dallas you know they keep leading 13 nothing make you squander a couple of timeouts wrong the coach at that time they said now they have one left that s the problem with blowing them any time you never know when youre gonna need them and i thought really becoming the factor for 17 in counties and you know a castle a field goal in this situation puts him up for again as the first down inside the 34 i dont think the giants are thinking field all right donna theyre i think theyre thinking shove it right down their throat and get out of it we talked about the giants wanting to get in and out of the huddle in a hurry you know all emma can do is stand and watch as fossils offense continues to pound out first down now one of the things <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">kerry collins</person> talked about his job as the quarterback of this team is to manage the game part of managing the game is to snap the ball when youre trying to sit on the clock with about a second or two to go so that you can use up as much of the clock as he can let s get it down farber get in the backfield lonzo <person player="alonzo spellman" race="UNK" position="DE">spellman</person> rap temeka wouldnt let him go with the win in this game the giants clinched the nfc east crown they won in 97 and they have the advantage if they went next week they have homefield advantage throughout the playoffs who would have thought the new york giants would be able to get homefield advantage throughout the playoffs this year well ill tell you something and this dallas defense has not been the same since <person player="ebenezer ekuban" race="nonwhite" position="DE">ebenezer</person> a cuban was ejected after the fight because he just wreak havoc on carry pounds and was in the secondary a lot <person player="tiki barber" race="UNK" position="RB">barber</person> cut it back inside the 32 the 29 now the let it go working on the core now they let it go down to the twominute warning dallas has to be pretty careful when and how they want to use that last timeout 78 yards on the night for barbour most of them a couple light but ill tell you what talk about a makeshift defence s dallas defense these guys played a heck of a game tonight they really did they made a couple of mistakes on offense but defensively they were solid well one of the whole keys to their defensive concept is the big tackles inside hemmings and let our gone they dont have that anymore so theyve really had to scramble jim fossil now only two minutes away when taking another step in the guarantee and patrick and rich eisen should have been working with the calculators in the lab sportscenter for you and were done here the giants trying to keep the drive alive two minutes to go dallas down they will use the timeout right now and <person player="tim seder" race="UNK" position="K">tim</person> fossil has an interesting decision do you try for the field goal get the field goal about a forty seven yarder kick a field goal just one and have one block or do you just punted out deep and put the strength of your football team back out on the field i think that s the decision punted out deep i dont think you kick a field goal but we know that the manor to kick an 8 yard punt well let s not be too hard on <person player="brad maynard" race="white" position="P">brad maynard</person> he s been a terrific guy yes yes hed had a bad night theyre gonna kick a field goal here and it s gonna be 45 45 yards one block one miss for galilee so came into this game with 12 in a row and now there isnt any wind on the field there s no wind as a factor whatsoever in this stadium even though it s very windy in dallas look for <person player="dat nguyen" race="UNK" position="LB">dat</person> wind to try and push <person player="brandon noble" race="UNK" position="DT">noble</person> where the big guys right up the middle again he s got to get this up in a hurry and the kick is good the giants go up five for galileo who failed on his first two got this one through 1713 with a minute 49 to go dallas will have no timeouts of its disposal and one of the things with the giants that fossil was concerned about after the right after the detroit lion gate when they got beaten so badly was the special teams and tonight the special teams really showed up i like the interesting thing about him is when he said hey i cut the most valuable special team player after that detroit game for shanna livingstone i called 12 guys in the worst starters they were on a special team and he said now you understand if you make a mistake and im going to cut you and if you dont think so think about who i just cut ill tell you that left a lasting impression on a lot of people sometimes you have to lay down the law you know i mean this isnt over yet the intrigue continues a minute 49 seconds even though you dont have any timeouts if the giants decide that they dont want to go after <person player="anthony wright" race="nonwhite" position="QB">anthony</person> right he can eat up a lot of yards get out of bounds you make a throw down the field you get an interference call the giant defense is going to have to continue to go after him i i was just gonna say if <person player="anthony wright" race="nonwhite" position="QB">anthony wright</person> thinks he s seen fracture before <person player="jason tucker" race="UNK" position="WR">jason tucker</person> at the decamp a <person player="brandon short" race="UNK" position="LB">short</person> kick <person player="jason tucker" race="UNK" position="WR">tucker</person> from the 11 let s sit outside and out of bound espn sunday night football across the internet generation by bmw the ultimate driving machine by sutter home sutter home tasted commitment and by best buy to the latest at best buy dalla starts firm it s 32 as ji boys needed touchdown his giant defense has just given up 19 yards in the second half white with a swim to the 37 there are no timeouts left for dallas taking too much time way too much you know he only ran to twominute drills and he spit his career here in regular games earlier this week wednesday so you know youre talking about a time in the game where a young quarterback has very little experience now it s nerd in the yard they have to keep this going and were almost down to a minute already supporter back teeth but i dont know whether he made it and i did not mind give me a guard <person player="brandon short" race="UNK" position="LB">short</person> now yet now yet now what you do is you throw the ball down the field just like its first intent you try and pick up eight nine ten yards though yards is always <person player="brandon short" race="UNK" position="LB">short</person> burning time off this clock it s the inexperience of <person player="anthony wright" race="nonwhite" position="QB">anthony</person> right at this point of the game that s not allowed that one i get not earnest would take you ten seconds to one pile you got the first gym fossil in 1990 he managed to win one one when they were down by 12 the more in the year 2000 who started out well this defenseless guys has been just i mean the entire night theyve made a few mistakes on holding penalties and a passenger for his family but other than
