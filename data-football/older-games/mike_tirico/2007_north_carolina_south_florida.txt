miami so many successful seasons down there and now he s trying to get the carolinian program the car opening picture oh <person player="jerome murphy" race="UNK" position="DB">murphy</person> gets it about a yard deep in his own end zone and working believe the biggies can kickoff returns as a 23 yard opening return take a look at the south florida offense with the number one tailgater starting to the highpowered uss often led by matt grossie our quarterback taking it to the big east championship and starting a senior offensive tackle walter walker paving the way for our running back to be running all day go bulls usf and you probably have some pride on tailgating week youve got the face paint and we are ready to go once the campus and the first period of the game goes to <person player="benjamin williams" race="UNK" position="RB">benjamin</person> william butch davis now in charge of the tar heels introduced of his carolina defense my defensive line are led by kim jong ballmer number 90 massive left defensive tackle and outside speed rush are highly taylor number 33 our linebackers are lived by number 48 two real map fast explosive play making linebacker and our secondary is led by tremaine <person player="trimane goddard" race="UNK" position="DB">goddard</person> number 33 the <person player="jermaine strong" race="UNK" position="DB">strong</person> safety so a couple of real stars on that defense in their cast today will be to shot this guy matt grupe who stopped just short of the 30yard line matt grupe loves to run the football family we talked to him and i asked him run or pass what you like to do so maybe today pass a <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> bit but when you watch him play and they run a lot of the reads play out of that shotgun where he has to read it and decide to keep it he keeps it more than any quarterback ive ever seen and rightly so because the kid can run with football and over 600 yards last year when was the biggest cookie of the year just a sophomore and there s a scarran in the backfield usually picked up a first down as he gets 13 yards and he s got a nice glass from the fullback chopping down the linebacker that s ben williams watch him come in here and come down and cut this linebacker right there in the whole fam got his leg there s no way he can get off of that and grow these off through that hole picking up the first down the first down for the bulls opening drive to this game this short at the 43 yard line up top and that was picked off the hand<person player="mark paschal" race="UNK" position="LB">mark paschal</person>the linebacker was able to get a hold of it as he was looking for tor <person player="taurus johnson" race="UNK" position="WR">johnson</person> amari <person player="amarri jackson" race="UNK" position="WR">jackson</person> also in the general vicinity there is some question tab coming into this was this a trap game for jim levitz book ball team having beaten auburn and then playing west virginia next friday night this one kind of looked like a stumbling block but he said he never looked at it that way back didnt even mention it to the team and we asked matt gropey about it he said hey were just excited and enthusiastic to play some football vicki had west virginia coming in next week and that is a big task of going on and the running back takes a couple of cargill weapons all the way down to the 40yard line at the 27 yard gain and just coming out of the backfield and running a choice route on the linebacker that s covered and the key to this is the time that back trophy has <person player="lucas darr" race="UNK" position="LB">lucas</person> no around he can pick it apart nobody even close to him and his he s got the matchup he wants his back on a linebacker and that youre going to win that one more often than not williams will walk on on the football team trucks into the starting role last year after injuries to the guys in cover he tried in now and they give it and he follows his guard around the way zach herman is the guy who s going to lead the play and get the good block he s were going to be the guard right up here is going to come off there and lead the way and watch the block he gets on their backside guard come around he heals the outside guy creating that scene for williams to cut up inside and any just run it through the secondary breaking tackle that was the 16 yard gain so it s now first and ten from the 14 million gift to put down again and is able to power his way down inside the 10 yard line and bill fen williams is the starter here now theyve got a couple other guys that they think can carry the mail and mike bordin<person player="jamar taylor" race="UNK" position="RB">jamar taylor</person>but william who s a junior he s kind of the older guy in this group he is the best blocker that they have and he s also an explosive runner and a good receiver as weve seen already on this drive 436 yards on the ground last year broken the leading returning rusher picks 22 theyre all right on this drive and he stopped spoke to another first down we spoke about jim leavitt now on the other sideline boots davis as you said at the top ham coaching his first college game in the state of lord assistance aid and miami university s head coach he dont reza bility to recruit in his first class that carolina was outstanding he s got a young talented football team the key is can they match the speed of the bullet here this afternoon third in a very short one for the talented freshman<person player="jamar taylor" race="UNK" position="RB">jamar taylor</person>his daughter was no good pain on the outside and used the speed to get around the edge to get off the board terrific opening drive to the south morning and they try for islamic <person player="delbert alvarado" race="UNK" position="K">alvarado</person> in the ascent the extra point and it is the 7nothing southward early for jim leavitt the bowls come out that first drive they just hammer it down the field they finish it off with this touchdown right here by <person player="mike ford" race="UNK"

about starting at the defensive line we have george selvi always getting sex followed by a middle linebacker senior been mopping and always shutting them down my boy and my jenkins let s go bold so the full run defense for the first time as another task was complete this time or incomplete excuse me this time to journalize trying to get the tailback weight out of the out of the backfield i say

dj yeh grows to the back very poised for a lecture tour redshirt freshman and no experience coming in but he s showman he can play thirty can he goes down george go be released the country in fact even though this is only game of the year unbelievable speed rusher going around the edge here is right here and youre going to see him just win the port race around the edge beating<person player="kyle jolly" race="UNK" position="OL">kyle jolly</person>it s just your speed and the thing about him is get off he gets off the ball quicker than any lime and i think ive seen in the country and he s got an advantage to be played center he was an allstate center in high school so he knows a <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> bit about when that guys going to snap the ball and his his dissipation skills are outstanding so back already for solving<person player="marcus edwards" race="UNK" position="WR">marcus edwards</person>get ready to feel the posh social for the part there are ripple selfie in fact doesnt when he s going after quarterback he s thinking please dont throw the ball office for five euro penalty to fulfill if you know in speaking with him you know i asked him about be a guess on that snap count sometimes and suggest i do but he says he knows from being at centers a rhythm that a center has in particular when it s a silent count when that centers snapping in the shotgun he lifts his head up put it down pause and then snap and theyll be times that up with perfection they know where he is only the sophomore in shorts faulty<person player="terrence brown" race="UNK" position="P">terrence brown</person>does get the cut on top of the delay of game that s a good floater fielded at the fifteen by market february but he will be advancing on a couple of guys finally taken down after only a two yard games south florida under jim at leavitt has had some great upsets the last few years how sweet it is their very first win against the ranking the opponent afp number 7 west virginia on west virginia s home turf and that was their last game as that task is caught by samar corner and assessment is over the run for a south florida first down the row map makes this up and a south florida team no longer an unknown commodity and certainly no longer a bigger surprise that theyre able to do anything on the football team on a football field router or the largest enrollment in the entire country well never mind the biggie theyve only been playing football for 11 years yeah i saw something where theyre number 9 in the nation and enrollment and the only 10 years of football this is the 11th season jim leavitt defend their coach the entire way and they started out as a as a 1 double 18 moved up and they have some very good only cooley losing season in their 10 years of existence and they are ranked for the first time coming into this week hammond and rightly so this is a good football team we saw flashes of it last year some of the upsets that they had and then coming out in the hand and auburn that loss and auburn s field last week was an amazing performance for this football team in that man was the first time i ever beat an sec team and as ray mentioned the first time i had ever been in the top 25 and they are looking for more rosy up top completion suggesting mr junior four of clothes down well go down on the field not a rostrum will care for more on the boat all right pam 11 years ago you mentioned when this usf football program started it consisted of a trailer and unlit practice field at a coach named jim 11 well that trailer is long gone theyve got a nice office now theyre playing in this nfl stadium and coach levesque team is now the second fastest in the history of college football to go from start up to rank early boise state has done it faster we how south florida trying to get back into the bowl picture looking for big east championship better off just in time and it is off of the hands of ed nur aldin a retro freshman from here in tampa florida timeline for the south florida program is raw engines is all began in 1996 they had one year of practice in 97 their first year on the field they joined division 1 double a and they were able to be kentucky wesleyan in their first game 82 3sided to the regard transition here in the 1a join conference usa and now in the big east and it s very interesting the big east at once time lapped upon when they were still haters ecs lot and now they are they have four teams ranked from that conference and cincinnati on the verge of becoming ranked in the big e has become a big piece i think theyre as good as any conference out there right now nipping at the heels of the sec where everyone thinks that the best football being played in the country right now south florida knocked off auburn last two weeks ago so the big east is definitely making a statement on the heels of last year into this year and the timeout has been taken about time less our both teams no huddle running up and down the field it s a bad baseball game boots gave us his first year at north carolina very highprofile coach obviously and he s trying to elevate that programmer right now theyre trailing south florida 7 nothing welcome back to raymond <person player="james arnold" race="UNK" position="DB">james</person> stadium south florida leading north carolina 7 to nothing<person player="mike ford" race="UNK" position="RB">mike ford</person>was a fagio touchdown run culminating a 78 yard opening drive for matt dwarfee scheme girl she s so exciting the big east rookie of the year last year now a sophomore and coming off the timeout jason a third entry and we complete front one jessie hester junior and depending on the market will indeed be a first down jessie hester junior has become the number one receiver for matt trophy watch him just run a hitch route get past the sticks set down make that catch secure the football move to change exact what he was supposed to do and hester thought that overtime touchdown for the win against auburn he had caught six passes on the day five of them in the middle of the field and then they picked him to the middle and ranked him outside and that s how they got that touchdown the wingeating auburn in overtime hazard only four career receptions before that game in which he had six catches kofi tackle down inside the 20 that s exciting stick to our game a trophy is so comfortable in that pocket watch him sit back here and read the defense nobody coming here and nobody around he s able to step up and deliver the picture perfect form throw and he hits houston great on the six and took em for six first down from inside the 20 handoff frozen chocolate as williams is stopped at the 15 yard line by darrell mac <person player="jerome murphy" race="UNK" position="DB">murphy</person> told us yesterday that he thought with his self defense of north carolina as you look at his numbers that he could just hit some shots downfield and make some big fight and in particular when he saw a blitz coming he felt that they could if they could pick up the blitz the speed of their receivers they could have some things down the field greg <person player="grant gregory" race="UNK" position="QB">gregory</person> the offensive coordinator for south florida <person player="johnny white" race="UNK" position="RB">johnny</person> logano in charge of the defense for the tar heels second and six and though she hangs on to it and gets it free yard short of the first down <person player="aleric mullins" race="UNK" position="DL">mullins</person> making the stop rant a <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> draft play and there s coach chuck pagano who was a defensive coordinator with butch davis been with him for several years him in fact that s one of the main reasons he said he took the job is just an opportunity to continue to coach and work with which david they have great respect and admiration for each other i just people fantas economic said that he felt that there is a third line in the slant loud is one of their favorite things to do when they get down there right around the 10yard line and pretty much sure theyre going to have manonman coverage and they think the fair guy mary <person player="amarri jackson" race="UNK" position="WR">jackson</person> can beat anybody in at 65 202 pounds he uses that big body to get between that defender in the ball mouth and reel it in for the touchdown <person player="delbert alvarado" race="UNK" position="K">alvarado</person> with the extra point south florida with two drives and two touchdowns that one a 12 yard strike to omari <person

tailgating joke on were going to have more on him he is a professional tailgater goes all over the country to do it what a big yeah youve got a okay and if anyone would know got the most experience in have ever known and im talking about kick returners out there shows his skill by pushing his way up to the 37 yard line if you go back to restated my pant to take a peek around the family of networks on espn2 west virginia got a long run from <person player="darius powell" race="UNK" position="DL">darius</person> renaud and then feed plate and pushed in a touchdown it s 10 nothing there as west virginia is on top of east carolina on espnu taylor bennett s throwing his first touchdown pass of the year <person player="cedric hill" race="UNK" position="TE">cedric</person> pearman answered with a touchdown for virginia georgia tech coming off that loss last week tied with the wahoo s halfway through the first reason virginia is the team that beaten with carolina last week 22 to 20 carolina lokanath losses by a combined five as they are 1 and 2 on the season<person player="johnny white" race="UNK" position="RB">johnny white</person>list to carry gets about four yards in a running game certainly an area of concern for north carolina not most experienced this is south florida the number 23 team in the country ranked for the first time in its history hosting north carolina s camo joined by ray bentley and rob simul care butch davis in charge of carolina s first game since he left the university of miami being coach back here in florida and again in south florida in the new week now at least ranking eyes within a big houston three wins over the season and that is one heck of a player he says my cars and roads and this is just good discipline by williams of staying home it s a bootleg look good fake right there williams is his sole responsibility on that play is the key contained and watched through the booth and he did it to perfection right there dont you think he s not particularly fast but a very smart player they have so much debt they have three concerning shoulders in that secondary and they are really good in that back seven in fact that whole defense was really good three goals closer to the ball and walker and his <person player="quinton person" race="UNK" position="DB">person</person> waiting to happen five figures it s as good as a punt and he s just aired it out and i dont blame him forgiving his receivers a chance to make a play because they are very good and they will make plays down there but this one you got through a <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> closer to your guy let me keep through this one way away from it williams with the speed just tracked it down and made a nice overfill the draft first interception of the year the fourth kick thrown by 8/5 even and that was a 47yard differential and field position so he might take that but on the staff that shows up as an it interception for <person player="tj yates" race="white" position="QB">yates</person> guilty gone away and he looked quickly deafening he really is going to all these receivers north carolina has turned the ball over quite a bit this season sam and that s been a problem a book davis knows he has to fix the first game their only win they were a plus three since then the minus five make it minus six because theyre minus one here today maybe <person player="james arnold" race="UNK" position="DB">james</person> madison and lost at east carolina and home to virginia in fact 11th last seven years north carolina has had a negative turnover margin as actually gets stopped for a loss<person player="mike ford" race="UNK" position="RB">mike ford</person>taken down by <person player="marvin austin" race="UNK" position="DL">marvin</person> auxin number nine and you were probably going to hear<person player="marvin austin" race="UNK" position="DL">marvin austin</person>s name the quite a few years what an outstanding young talent that he was kind of the cream of the crop of which davis is recruiting platt and i saw<person player="marvin austin" race="UNK" position="DL">marvin austin</person>at the us army all american bowl last year and he was the most dominant defensive lineman their heads and shoulders above everybody else and youll be starting for this carolina outfit for four years and now he s got a bright future in front of a me really a talented ballplayer they made that play before he comes right back and complete on the front <person player="carlton mitchell" race="UNK" position="WR">mitchell</person> often a freshman out of washington dc with a new high school number one rated defensive tackle is that he came to north carolina because he believed in butch davis vision and that is quite a testament because all the big school rapid attacks yeah he was highly recruited highly soughtafter and he s also one of those personality guy you know he could light up a room and he can get a all gone and get a defensive thing going with his enthusiasm and personality got four to four before on third down to ten matricide for five knowing complete they had it momentarily did jensen but it s worked out of the gans and for the first time today south florida is going to punt the football just a really nice play there by deonte williams he reached up in there and slap that ball out of <person player="courtney denson" race="UNK" position="WR">denson</person> hands because benson really had that ball he should have caught it should have been a first down deonte williams opposed to your starter richard kristen from jacksonville north carolina very young north carolina team is fielded by brandon trade and a 49yard punt result in an 11 yard return for tape and we are coming to you from raymond <person player="james arnold" race="UNK" position="DB">james</person> stadium courts the home of the tampa bay buccaneers so we have nice around these and were here along with ray bentley and this carolina team certainly a foundation is being set but they are very young football and they are you know you have 84 scholarship players and 51 of them had never set foot on a college football field prior to this year so you can see that they have some talent and theyve got some speed but they dont have the experience and theyre going to take a <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> while to really you know get things going the way puts david hawkins on here it is huge freshman on this ball and<person player="johnny white" race="UNK" position="RB">johnny white</person>is shackled down after a fiveyard gain we get you back to ruth davis right pam clemson in north carolina state historical a this is the kind of game the clemson boots tigers already up 7nothing well blackness weve been returning dicks risky state since the late 1976 one all the way back and tie the game at together the clemens on the doorstep trying to go up again here we have a 15 nothing new for south florida but there is a first down run for<person player="johnny white" race="UNK" position="RB">johnny white</person>6 up 6 yards and there are<person player="johnny white" race="UNK" position="RB">johnny white</person>redshirt freshman from asheville north carolina he s running back<person player="richie rich" race="UNK" position="RB">richie rich</person>was the only returning running back with any carries last year he had one carry for negative one yard fumble and a bonus that s it yeah they really are looking for that guy they can hang a hat on for that deer in the backfield and theyre giving<person player="johnny white" race="UNK" position="RB">johnny white</person>the first opportunity yet you got a look at the defense it s<person player="richie rich" race="UNK" position="RB">richie rich</person>that exited the second first round for carolina today and white with another one tomorrow as you put go down to rob simul care well if there is one thing that butch davis knows how to do it is recruit and his first time out an abbreviated recruiting season for him he had what the entire country considers one of the top recruiting classes in the country<person player="marvin austin" race="UNK" position="DL">marvin austin</person>to stand out from that class but with his recruiting ability demonstrated at miami was not going to be long before these guys get better there s a process in the blueprint and so exactly that well but it will put some time right meanwhile he was able to get outside and pick up another first down ten yards but for white or carson williams makes this top one p three freshmen have played this season for butch davis and he remember when he took over miami there was she was in a pickle there they had lost thirtyone scholarships on probation to really sort of built or we built that program and he thinks he can do the same thing at carolina which is a very good educational institution as well for states he s got so many things to offer potential student athlete and a lot of them see him and they think nfl because of his history his past there and then it s coaching staff six out of the nine guys on his staff have nfl experience and so young man wants to maybe take that next step he could go to a much better place chapel hill in butch davis only have so many firstround draft picks when he was at the university of miami started out as a dline coach there and went to the cowboys and the head coach at the university of miami the year after he left depending on a national championship and then the cleveland browns situation the flag is down a player was off five they look like george fell the jump but the ground situation that that front office is going to just a mess so you cant really pin that on foot yeah he did make the playoffs in second year but that was a tough outside from about a five he said finally well replace it it was a tough situation and north carolina had run the ball five consecutive times since that<person player="tj yates" race="white" position="QB">tj yates</person>interception they went back to the throw on that one and selby ended up offside so you i guess coach david pulled the reins in the <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> bit after his young redshirt freshman quarterback threw into the wrong jersey selvi already has a stack today but arent that anticipation was offsides theyll be reading the nation the six and a half sacks in again place two games coming into this one pitch back right and the oxen work for it but he holds on to it and kicks up actually i was dropped for about a yard loss<person player="carlton williams" race="UNK" position="DB">carlton williams</person>making another stop that is the end of the first quarter south florida s four touchdowns on its first two possession rich davis back in the state of florida coaching them up jim leavitt on the other sideline as we head through second quarter second quarter about to get underway south florida linna facing a third down and they convert the first third down gradually nick he goes across the field and picks up 19 big yards and<person player="hakeem nicks" race="nonwhite" position="WR">hakeem nicks</person>is an amazing run after the catch he guy he had a touchdown last week against virginia that was nothing short of amazing in fact coach called it the most amazing play he had ever seen and that s high praise but he can get it going he catches that football look out because they will block for him downfield and he can go to this at any given time next the acc is leading returning receiver an adhesion with the third down first contend now from the 27 down 40 nothing and<person player="johnny white" race="UNK" position="RB">johnny white</person>at the tailback is able to pick up eight yards may now and make you stuff like that pass was the first one on the current north carolina drive after the interception six straight running plays then the third down pass completion and they go back to the ground on this play and even more importantly theyre moving the football now on the ground and you know theyre getting it going and that s important for this football team not only the key with their drives going but the keith full offense off the field larry driven the ball he are facing the beckenham short and that is a mass on the play dan moppet get<person player="johnny white" race="UNK" position="RB">johnny white</person>in the backfield moffatt the

race="UNK" position="WR">johnson</person> has also proven that he can get it done just going to go both ways on this one <person player="taurus johnson" race="UNK" position="WR">johnson</person> had a 36 yard return before the penalty let s take a look now in our game track presented by john hancock and it started off well for south florida <person player="mike ford" race="UNK" position="RB">ford</person> with a 5 yard touchdown run mike on the opening drive and then amari <person player="amarri jackson" race="UNK" position="WR">jackson</person> mike fourth husband caught a 12 yard touchdown pass from that <person player="matt grothe" race="UNK" position="QB">grothe</person> who has had another solid start to hit to this game both on the ground and through the air

basketball player went to junior college before he came to south florida to play football and there is matt brophy very confident young man youre a sophomore you had that swagger when we spoke like a quarterback when he came to the room yeah although i dont know if he s point six feet tall and they having list to that no he s not 64 all he go through at 16 to 13 but a guy who came in thrust into the starting lineup the first game of last season pat tillman s got hurt for south florida and the in macro they never gave up that job and wally pipp him yep and took them to the ball game they beat east carolina in the papajohnscom bowl their first ever bowl victory their second ever bowl appearance and great things appear to be compounding for south florida after the penalties on the reverse the ball is taken by among my laurie <person player="amarri jackson" race="UNK" position="WR">jackson</person> a 5yard that sort of reach david hearted pàmies carolina and west virginia last couple years nobody s played the west virginia offense better than the pirates holding him to <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> over three yards to russ mountaineers doing a <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> better in morgantown today as halflife goes in 17 nothing mountaineers on top in the second quarter on espn2 at what these plays are still doing it doing their jobs and that s just in the second carolina people on and their second game of the season as askance annual gets the first down on that run let s take a look at the first two scores for the bull poured on the plows out gets it in and then his cousin amari <person player="amarri jackson" race="UNK" position="WR">jackson</person> on the slant route shows you the power uses the body so the cousins are on the board for the bull and they are the best of friends as well<person player="mike ford" race="UNK" position="RB">mike ford</person>and amari <person player="amarri jackson" race="UNK" position="WR">jackson</person> both from sarasota florida hillhill first catch of the season is a memorable bootleg action and hell inform the blocking tight and tight but he chose we wont get a football here to go be out on the perimeter and he throws on the run as well as anybody in the game and this is the time he gets it up to where only his guy can get it in the circus acrobatic 10th by<person player="cedric hill" race="UNK" position="TE">cedric hill</person>fending off the defenders 33 yards first im going to throw one out of pocket completed for a huge game then william bell is buried as soon as he got that carry but more capital got him down but for tv shows all over this box but he was a wide receiver in 2005 and it made the transition to tight end because he was such a good blocker but he shows you some of those wide receiver skills jolin up and takes it away from kendrick williams junior from valdosta georgia is hell but no gain for williams on first down and now out of the gun broken and five receivers pump blonde and he s going for <person player="amarri jackson" race="UNK" position="WR">jackson</person> at the end zone and contact but no penalty no penalty drive is down four more burning on the coverage he and <person player="amarri jackson" race="UNK" position="WR">jackson</person> were kind of locked up a <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> bit but no flag was thrown there great coverage by bernie he actually was playing off they tried to get him on that double move it called its logo where it s a slant mageau he didnt fight on the slant he kept discussion and he was able to be there and make a play on the ball from the 15 dont be this time over the million shows it behind his intended receiver once again rosa mari <person player="amarri jackson" race="UNK" position="WR">jackson</person> for more on south florida cousins let s go down to rob civil care well pam theyve

absolutable tied the game max sooner take the ensuing kickoff as we get to use the word ensuing for a rare time on the day 93 yards queues up 14 to 7 is papa john many searches have needed to get away from the dome and this is what my anger recited exactly what south florida was concerned about because their last game is two weeks ago against auburn and no hangover so far is there a 17 to 3 and gazette just came in and whacked and he hurt himself with the impetus of that hit that s as big a hit as youll be remember some pads cracking right there bam and see he goes in and that s scary to do especially with what happened to keep ever up in buffalo and god still lead with their heads a <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> bit too much and three and four right off the minute man from the lv who fell and <person player="johnny white" race="UNK" position="RB">johnny</person> what is a tailback position right now running back by committing for carolina picks up three allen prey with a stop just a violent hit as bichette made the stop that was being looked at over on the sideline and now he is up and walking around good to see south florida lead in north carolina 17:03 here at the buccaneers home field raymond <person player="james arnold" race="UNK" position="DB">james</person> stadium in tampa south floyd scoring touchdowns on the first two

position="WR">hakeem nicks</person>his favorite receiver and that was the timing on that was knight and <person player="tj yates" race="white" position="QB">yates</person> was kind of a <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> bit slow starting here and he has done that in past games and he s a streaky kind of guy hit gold you know 206 207 in batman except in a row so he s a guy to protect fight i have 19 section so far as lg with that carrier member <person player="tj yates" race="white" position="QB">yates</person> has not played a whole heck of a lot of football he went to high school and marietta georgia when he was a sophomore quarterback it was a beer option based offense and he and the other starting the other quarterback rather alternated every other series which is very bizarre yeah that s that s really almost crazy to do and he didnt like it didnt even play football as a junior then they changed coaching staff and brought in a spread offense but he said that might be more to my liking and by the fifth game of the year the scholarship offered from north carolina accepted on is the first school to offer affiliate offers from other schools radar because he didnt hold the junior that passes off the hands of neck there s a flag down looking to offside jarick blue one of the defensive ends jumps a <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> bit early that tells you that pj8 was doing a nice job with his cadence and that s important because south florida their defensive front is predicated on the get off they try to get off as quickly as possible and sometimes hell yeah sigh come on i need on the visa secondary as i was saying pan sometimes dealt gas and go a <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> early and that s what brewery did in that case wally burnham is the offensive coordinator he s a neat guy to talk to he played for bear bryant and alabama in his eighth year and down there on the sidelines who s his wife theyve got ten said he got a lot sundiata relationship between those two phil gramm as<person player="johnny white" race="UNK" position="RB">johnny white</person>is tackled down by <person player="tyrone mckenzie" race="nonwhite" position="LB">tyrone</person> materials on rome s here in jackal is again <person player="tyrone mckenzie" race="nonwhite" position="LB">mckenzie</person> is an interesting story a transfer from iowa state he came over with his former head coach dan mccarney who was the defensive line coach now for the bulls that he got himself a waiver to give instant al even tackle<person player="jerome murphy" race="UNK" position="DB">jerome murphy</person>comes with a late lid and he speed his closing speed was just amazing i thought <person player="tj yates" race="white" position="QB">yates</person> is going to get this thing off so lots of blazing speed to the time bank and that the suddenness of this defense i mean he aint just thinking oh i got a perfect situation here and that s the third time <person player="tj yates" race="white" position="QB">yates</person> has been hit today but the quickness and the suddenness and the speed of this bold defense allows them to make plays just like that and the ball took to them from incoming opportunities for the carry that did not gather it in from brown and filtered by marcos effort nablus is knock out of bounds at the 21 yard line as we go to rob kimmel cara <person player="james arnold" race="UNK" position="DB">james</person> stadium with the commissioner of tailgating joke on joe how does one exactly get to be the commissioner of tailgating those persistence in eating a lot this is my 12th season ive traveled to over 500,000 miles in about 500 games wow impressive and some good mules along the way well be back with more from the commissioner affiliating a <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> later im so jealous for brabus down there yeah persistence and eating i could do that selfappointed selfappointed commissioner of tailgating tailgating week here on espn and that great <person player="quinton person" race="UNK" position="DB">person</person> do it here in campus brophy and he has tackled out about a yard short of the first down by the talented<person player="marvin austin" race="UNK" position="DL">marvin austin</person>keys to tailgating and this becomes right from the commission cells well the tradition of course you have to understand where youre going and what the traditions are their participation very important and location location location you got to be parked in the right spot keep things simple and then bring more food that you need that s good advice for anybody anywhere any circumstances to the boots would be numbers here thank you sister tailgating a great tradition with the great things about college football as south florida and<person player="matt grothe" race="UNK" position="QB">matt grothe</person>they decide to take a timeout their first time out of the cafe at 17 to three lead and one this is the state of florida there are several division one a or both of division school university of miami you have central florida in orlando gainesville has the gators tallahassee florida state right here in tampa you have south florida as the google map takes you right down into their campus we are coming to you from a few miles away where they play at raymond <person player="james arnold" race="UNK" position="DB">james</person> stadium just a beautiful nfl facility and jim leavitt is alkhaimah that he is not a proponent house and oncampus football stadium he was a said we need a women s softball facility first in a soccer facility so he understands the big picture there is nothing wrong we play in your home games in this play williams with the carry and something pulled it short of the first down in fact now theyre going to say he has originally it looked like they were going to <person player="mark paschal" race="UNK" position="LB">mark</person> some sort that it is a new first down for the bowl there are seven and bowl subdivision schools in the state of florida it s always been the big three came with miami florida and florida state but i came to go back after the first down and hell pick up about five yards on first down right how would you rate the school well ill tell you what i think florida s got to be number one because they are the defending national champions and i got south florida to miami a three florida state down here at for central florida at five and that s so close to florida atlantic and then down there at the bottom florida international but when you talk to south florida they like to be mentioned in the top in the football and market central s elites but cannot gather it in and grow he knows that they missed an opportunity for six points well he showed you the strength of his arm there that one traveled about 55 yards through the air and he jumps over through <person player="marcus edwards" race="UNK" position="WR">edwards</person> who lick it out nicely but that jody has had all kinds of time all day long and you have time you can take the chances to throw the ball down the field and they liked it so it throw some shots from time to time and building he was almost five receivers been again dragging down breaking loads for the first down we might have a cold in the backfield that s usually what to get in fact it is holding on the board gates absolutely first down run and it will bring up a third and long to south florida you are a linebacker ray in the national football league and how difficult would it be to play a guy like grote you think you have everything covered and then out he goes and that s the hardest thing to defend is a quarterback who can run like he can because as good as he is you have to commit a guy to signing him a lot of times and that takes somebody out of your pass rush and out of your coverage so you know it just kind of thins you out on defense and then he still act to make the play even if you do find such a thing exhibit strength if you can make something out enough i mean he almost did it there but the hogan call brings them back to the 1315 northey again using a speed to get out of trouble close to the first down marker looking for jesse hector junior to gather there what a guess we showed you some arm strength on that one because he had to get bending in there quick as the defender were right there on hester take a look at him in the pocket he s going to set up again steps up to avoid the pressure excuse me but then throws the ball on the run goes the ball on the run so well now with the third and 16 to it right at the stick and had to continue think emerging as a primetime receiver those whose number is continuing to be impressive and the timeout is taken again by the bulls yeah it s a <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> confusion there and they had to burn another one they still have one left which davidson team trailing 17 three welcome back we are in tampa the home of the university of south florida school founded in 1956 over 41,000 students go there the largest enrollment in school into the east and they are serious football fans down here to speak gator country jim leavitt grew up around here state petersburg area and loyally transitioning mixed into gold country he thought there was great opportunity here fabulous job team ranked for the first time ever now under 23 after the timeout first content to the bowl and grossing <person player="james arnold" race="UNK" position="DB">james</person> going through it and then goes down if he has taken out after about a oneyard gain by<person player="marvin austin" race="UNK" position="DL">marvin austin</person>you take a look at this right here we see number 90 that s gentle on ballmer who was a senior leader on this football team and he kind of get his guys going knocking people running to get him going and that sometimes you need that kind of leadership you praise has been praised by butch davis from his skill and leadership mel kiper has an 80s on the big board for all three years coming out to be eligible for the graph <person player="amarri jackson" race="UNK" position="WR">jackson</person> gathers that one in we go back to week david and the number one team in the state of florida glosses last three in the state of mississippi and the gators were sleepwalking until percy harvin s down to the alarm maybe good catch of the not perfect people pass and and slipped his way into the end zone and maybe florida shaking off that hangover theyre up 73 on the bed the team that south florida will play in 2010 the polls are going to go to game jill to take on the desire to fit the longing tech top three youve decided on the field season delays both heroes out towards the sideline he had<person player="taurus johnson" race="UNK" position="WR">taurus johnson</person>and marquez said work there aint just put that one out of bounds really and if his guy was able to you know the leap a tall building in a single bound he might have been able to get it and<person player="taurus johnson" race="UNK" position="WR">taurus johnson</person>is the guy who said to the media this week i thought we already won the top two free history in in the state of florida he said i didnt know miami was doing right and you know that goes 11 just plunges when his guys get built board their bulletin board material for opponents even though that three years down the road tim well it was looked under both snyder kansas state a buttondown kind of guy and he was not thrilled to hear that as flags are down before and now north carolina moved the purse and if they broke into that neutral zone it could be a grievous error and give a free first down to the bull see which way they want to call this one s fourth and three or is forcing sir as a young football team type mistake you give them a whole new possession because on 4th in three you cant hold your water on pump defense that s going to be disappointed rolling pains for butch davis and this north carolina team and they gives gift first down 426 left to go here in the first half and an opportunity lost which davis would seem to get on the board the martelleur truth freshman from lakeland florida now in as a running back next to brophy in the guac joking with <person player="amarri jackson" race="UNK" position="WR">jackson</person> laurie <person player="amarri jackson" race="UNK" position="WR">jackson</person> was ever get it but he was bound so it is incomplete one bomber and here he is right here we saw him kind of roughing up one of his teammates previously and on this one he gets a nice pass rush and he wraps up that trophy after the throw palmer we had a chance to talk with him and you know he was very excited when coach davis got the job so you know what you got a chance here the morale is higher around here now and theyre really happy to see what s going on and he takes place toward that corner to turn it hilla with the kerry bomber in fact said of davis couldnt get a better coach or a better <person player="quinton person" race="UNK" position="DB">person</person> so that s high praise indeed later tonight at 7:45 eastern on espn it s georgia in tuscaloosa to take on alabama house football presented by fest by part of tailgating week presented by gaspard georgia 2 and 1 on the season boy bama threeandoh after a thrilling win over arkansas last week that s going to be a good ballgame right there watch out for nick saban and he can do it no matter what you think about it while im do it he s making a lot of money after share that s what some quotes the wrong way nice move after the catch by <person player="amarri jackson" race="UNK" position="WR">jackson</person> he gets the first down ball making a stop but not before an eightyard gain arie <person player="amarri jackson" race="UNK" position="WR">jackson</person> one of those guys who was a high school quarterback you fight you hear that so often when you get to you know skills physicians receivers guys that play safety they come out of high school they play quarterback in high school because theyre the best athlete on the team and that s kind of where you need that guy but they dont necessarily have that ability to do it at the next level it has four catches including a touchdown today taylor gets the carry and picks up a couple on first down one timeout left for south florida here larry <person player="aleric mullins" race="UNK" position="DL">mullins</person> almost forced his head off which davis in his first year as a head coach at north carolina these guys though have yet to lose their first football game indiana bill lynch taking over after terry hefner s death and of course we already mentioned nick saban what he s done at bama and <person player="mark paschal" race="UNK" position="LB">mark</person> dantonio with the michigan state parks got them off the three and oh and they played notre dame later on today and that s going to be an interesting one play the drive coming up this guy kept alive by a penalty on close down grote field who knows where the first down kick is that he has marked a couple yards short when he just likes to run the football because he had two receivers wide open on his routes and he just bumps it down you can see the bamiyan straight he got i think our pocket go get a first sound he does so <person player="matt grothe" race="UNK" position="QB">grothe</person> a freshman record for him last year with 600 points of yards on the ground leading rusher for his team as they were really hard in the back here yeah tonight we will know the sportsman pick up the first down and a nice block for his right tackle walter walter the leader up there the fifth year senior just collapsed that whole side of the line and a return to the run the returning fulltime starters on this offensive line to equipment into centers a firmament guard or blockers fit and dial up front it guys doing a good job particularly on his drivers youre about to hit the 15th play remember it was kept alive by that or found county by the tar heel sampson was 60 m go keep it for once again and he has wrestled down around the 13 yard line by <person player="darius powell" race="UNK" position="DL">darius</person> <person player="darrius massenburg" race="UNK" position="DL">massenburg</person> carolina rotating in quite a few defensive linemen keeping them fresh they need to because they have the added duty of chasing a quarterback in there you know it s bad enough having to rush the passer but when they often he breaks campaign and starts running and those big guys got to keep huffing and puffing after you need to keep that breath decadence 1718 gross he tries to get out of trouble drag it down and russo s down around the 19 yard line could have another hole coming up howell coming in to get <person player="matt grothe" race="UNK" position="QB">grothe</person> who has a couple of words after the play all that <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> spindly by broglie is getting away from highly paler 77 offense attend yall panel late will replays it out that s on jake griffin thurston is the center started when a proposal on who was out with a hurt knee and which dave is still into it got the body english going on down there but i was going to say about matt grove me that s the one drill that strength <person player="grant gregory" race="UNK" position="QB">gregory</person> the offensive coordinator has his guys do every day that s a scramble drill they try to avoid that outside rutgers make a move and skin outside they do it every day there s an 11 teams and it is not down good coverage by beyonce williams and kendrick bernie mac grove if he can just throw that ball a <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> bit farther he s going to have it wide open to jessie has to because hester s behind those defenders the ball just isnt thrown far enough and bernie looked like he was the one who got the hand on although he were both right there off to a baseball player on this carolina team went listen to a college world theory the underlaying the freshman from a richer pressure from jacksonville north carolina nice play and now with a huge holding 18 boys should come to change for grocery to pick up and from an <person player="trimane goddard" race="UNK" position="DB">goddard</person> picks it off for dakar news you dont see that very often but<person player="darius powell" race="UNK" position="DL">darius powell</person>that defense event was able to knock it away from a stroke and you can see he s a <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> frustrated and disappointed with himself as <person player="trimane goddard" race="UNK" position="DB">goddard</person> comes up with the fumble and coming up with takeaways has been a major challenge for north carolina for a few years now he right there the hand got on the ball and knocked it loose and that s just a big defensive play for north carolina nowhere to go with the football either look at the coverage down the field got five receivers running and making turnins at various level but theyre covered up nicely there s a third and very long so kofi he tried to make the play for himself but the play was really made by gary it s your freshman from waldorf now and highly favored he favors mentoring here as<person player="brooks foster" race="UNK" position="WR">brooks foster</person>gets it and picks up about nine let s go back to reach davis my pants coming up on the pontiac perform at halftime report you think this play two games not good hangover saturday no where s the head bobbing more than a louisville derek uses already puts 21 on them florida has slept walk through most of the first half georgia tech apparently not over the bc lost yet <person player="mark paschal" race="UNK" position="LB">mark</person> and lou got their notebooks ready well give you impressive quarterback and the coach s pep talk coming up <person player="brooks foster" race="UNK" position="WR">foster</person> got the bit but he was down and quick annie after he made the catch remember the shetty the one earlier in the game a huge hit on a snapple the kind of not concealer that the comes up and that s the second interception of the day gone by pj a nice read here by just yet just stepping in there in front of the receiver and taking the ball away <person player="tj yates" race="white" position="QB">yates</person> with a pump fake didnt like it came back to the other side when you come back the other side that late youre going to have trouble and he looked for<person player="brooks foster" race="UNK" position="WR">brooks foster</person>but guess yet just stepped right in front of it contact on that play which davis frustrated so to get the ball on the fumble and insult right back the first interception of the season one timeout left flags are down all over the place and broken throws incomplete but should have been caught by mike four hit him right between the fish check out the flag what has two coaches on the season coming into this game to drop that one and that s the third drop path of the day for south florida killing a substitution defense at the 5yard penalty for sin i could have been a lot bigger of a play than that though his board had that one hitting right between the two in the sixth and that s one problem that ive seen on film in south florida they do have a tenant to drop the football but with that penalty at first and five from the 32 is growth the improvisers once again there s a chorus <person player="taurus johnson" race="UNK" position="WR">johnson</person> <person player="taurus johnson" race="UNK" position="WR">johnson</person> widely stepped out abound after a 15 yard gain 30 seconds left and a half and remember only one timeout left for south florida and that <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> spin move that matt grote made is what im talking about that they practice every day see how he s stepping up in boom turns the shoulder and reverses his field it gets outside of the contained and that defies enough time to get people open and it keeps him safe on the perimeter texas 420 not 20 yards out the johnsons will be the primary fighting his man yesterday any complete answer was defended by <person player="taurus johnson" race="UNK" position="WR">johnson</person> williams on that play now for 24 seconds left to go dangerous throw by matt drove through there late over the middle just got it over the hands of the outstretched linebacker and have 24 seconds left in the first half from the 16 way on eviction shots in the end zone if you can throw thief said amy walking towards the corner and throws it well out of down in canada that would have been a touchdown an onyear mr as a highly teyla was able to get some pressure up the middle on croci and now there are 19 seconds left and they sure would like to get a another an opportunity to get a touchdown as opposed to attempting a field goal here before the half end look at matt growth these numbers in and out of the pocket out of the pocket three four four four 53 yards and like i said earlier he is as accurate as anyone ive seen on the run throwing the football last time you had a cleaner shot at your <person player="mark paschal" race="UNK" position="LB">mark</person> taylor and kayla tackle down at the 50 yard line berni with the tackle they finally call a timeout for about six or seven seconds to run off road since the end of the play and they were asking for it i coach levites over there right now saying hey i was calling timeout theyre gonna i think theyre going to put some more time on the field as they could get coach leavitt off the playing field i think it s very close to a first down payment anybody has to measure this to see for sure but the thing is when did they call the time out is it for just the six seconds left that we fear did they get it earlier in<person player="delbert alvarado" race="UNK" position="K">delbert alvarado</person>the placekicker is on the field as the world come out and measure to see if it says first down but only six seconds left to go in the half and now no time outs for south florida and jim let it spill down theyre upset trying to plead his case with the official and i im pretty sure i saw matt go he s sleeping for a time out when there was 12 seconds left and theyre just a <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> bit short in the argument also to be made as to why the official kitten call timeout for measurement right now theyre looking at a 23 yard field goal with that by <person player="delbert alvarado" race="UNK" position="K">alvarado</person> who is true from 32 areas they used his 2 for 6 in the last game against auburn admit that gametying 18 your honor with under a minute left to go to send it to overtime and then they were able to win in the extra period that was a gutsy call i think by jim leavitt to go ahead and let that guy nick won after missing four in a row well he had one block and missed three after making his first one and he stuck with his guys but it never really entered his mind he was fully confident sticker would make it he was more concerned about should they go for it down there and a fourth in food situation if they were in it and decided to kick it and tie it up and hopefully get the overtime and win it that way and they did it is indeed no time out flex six seconds left and a 23yard attempt said wide left weve been missing in the webmaster snap was high negated definitely suberino doing a good job getting that high snap down and oiling <person player="delbert alvarado" race="UNK" position="K">alvarado</person> the score amused or kicked his second field goal today matt growth he has been outstanding so far here in the first half today take a look at some of the work he s done did that one very nicely touchdown fat outside to amari <person player="amarri jackson" race="UNK" position="WR">jackson</person> and broke a tackle in on the role going a dime to hill who brings it in im a trophy has had an outstanding first half here today he s been able to run the football with success he s hitting on 16 and 27 passes but he bent three drops as well over 250 yards of total offense for brophy through the air and on the ground dj struggling with a couple of interception review freshman quarterback in north carolina and there is taylor <person player="jonathan smith" race="UNK" position="DB">jonathan</person> on the sideline the mother piggies quarterback other than glossy that are getting a lot of a lot of <person player="aj love" race="UNK" position="WR">love</person> a lot of you know heisman potential perhaps and <person player="matt grothe" race="UNK" position="QB">grothe</person> what do you take care how would you measure up against these other guys well i think he s right next to pat white as far as being a dual threat to the ability to run and throw the football i think out of those guys prom is this the guy that s going to throw the ball better than the rest of them but he is not a running threat so you look at a double threat kind of guy in brophy and pat white are in the same class as far as i remember too those were numbers coming into this weekend s action and brophy it only played two game problems other guys playing 30 south florida with the bye the kick off bounces out abound and more brood cascading down because it looked like it was touched by a north carolina player before it went out of bounds brian taylor back up tight end look like he touched it and if he did then the ball will be at the point and be spotted at the point where it went out of bounds as opposed to the 35 in leather played at the university alibi all ticket pain to ball bit please on the 35 year old on course the game probably a moot point of only three seconds left in the half but it s still look like the carolina guy touched it so <person player="tj yates" race="white" position="QB">tj</person> y8 family the penalty would kind of overrule which it did the weather was a great baseball player of missouri like the big 8 in the batting average one year when he was down there i was turning and turning over the football when he s been a great success i think he s a goodlooking guy too if im the review were going to review it to see i am at the carolina podcaster which is what we saw up here and you are only saying that about leavitt because you were mistaken for him yesterday and glavine and therefore if he thinks you know you look like him you must be good looking yeah you figured me out on that one but yeah i was over at the mall and a guy and theyre gonna review whether or not it was touched or not here but yeah he had a guy say hey are you coach leavitt know it looked like he missed it so it probably would be unc ball at the 35 after they decide if he does touch it right there and say might have hit his helmet or something but that flying taylor home but no up here it looked like it might have because the ball took a weird turn take a look at this one right big so and again it s the defector right and a play called on the field there has to be evidence to overturn it and i dont think there will be enough and it really is a moot point shouldnt really stop the game this long over something that is irrelevant that there s our guys upstairs that s john spencer youre looking at right there he s the communicator and then john <person player="jonathan smith" race="UNK" position="DB">smith</person> is hidden behind that monitor down over here and he s the guy who is the actual replay official but john spencer the guy that you see on your screen he s actually a caddy at augusta national for his parttime job not a bad day serious he stands up gets a <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> face time just three seconds left to go here in the first half take a lot of time to figure out something that really has no bearing on the game here looks like they have finally come up with a decision after review the play stands is called on the field nor columbia was a ball on the 35 yard line first at the end they didnt really have enough video evidence to confirm or overrule so they give the ruling the playoff stand s called and just get north carolina taking me and well go to halftime here oh that s a lane for an e30 jy8 did a couple of interceptions in the first half takes the knee conner bar to the 40yard field goal the only four for north carolina<person player="mike ford" race="UNK" position="RB">mike ford</person>and amari <person player="amarri jackson" race="UNK" position="WR">jackson</person> two cousins best of friends with the touchdown for south florida as we head down the robson well care who s rich in <person player="aj love" race="UNK" position="WR">love</person> it all right here with coach levesque two early touchdowns in the to field goes what went well offensively for you there in the first half you know we were able to mix up the pass and run pretty good the problem is we had our opportunities here towards in the second quarter and didnt take very good advantage of the field position we had you know the balance is helpless alright coach thank you very much and back to you all right rob 329 total yards from south florida only 77 for north carolina it is a 20 to treat south florida lead as we go to reap davis for the pontiac performance halftime report and welcome back to espn college football presented by carscom as we were getting ready for the second half north carolina trailing south florida 23 at the half and let s take a look at what happened in the first half with our game track presented by john hancock and it started off matt brophy has been terrific flow through the air and wikipedia s thrown a touchdown pass and on the other side he j april 25th and the north carolina offense has really struggle even the yard is 329 for the bulls only 80 for the tower hill healed and they just havent been able to get the offense going pham and a lot of it comes down to opportunity only 12 passes thrown in the first half he really hasnt had a chance to get settled in there and do that booty that he do so well and they need to get things going on offenses dana few drive and open it up a <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> bit and get pj8 throwing the ball down the field more get your freshman from marietta georgia coming in here second in the acc intention until 15yard return to start the exhaust they will start from the 21 yard line as a rain the rain has started to fall here in tampa raymond <person player="james arnold" race="UNK" position="DB">james</person> stadium it s just a matter of time starts coming around here look at these first half stats and the huge disparity all the way down to the time of possession for the bulls they played very well on defense three yards of per play so far for carolina theyve got to improve that number and they come out that second half and they put <person player="ej wilson" race="UNK" position="DL">ej</person> in the shotgun theyre going to throw the football counter gone for the 30 off you go that s the only offensive scoring play so far <person player="amarri jackson" race="UNK" position="WR">jackson</person> also he s a one of the several true fresher on the team had the ball thrown behind it it was closely covered by colton williams and theyre going to a goal huddle offense almost like a twominute drill and this is where<person player="tj yates" race="white" position="QB">tj yates</person>to me watching on tape is that his back when he doesnt have a lot of time about it think about it just throw the ball around play football and he s able to complete one on that super knopfler but at the very short three yard gain then mop it the middle linebacker the veteran has been starting to shoot as a freshman is there for the stop and the only problem with going through a hurry out pampers if you dont get a first down you kind of killed what youre trying to do and get that get bank going if your defense off the field a <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> bit the year rain falling here kind of the tampa bay buccaneers and seven opening drive to the first caption the pressure gets it underwent and completes the path but that s a fine tackle by <person player="bruce carter" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bruce</person> mom sameer on planalto who was thrown him three times on that possession a lot of <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> stuff underneath and mom premier came up he s the leading tackler for this south florida squad and that was a nice open field tackle allowing no run after the catch that s what carolina was counting on maybe a <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> short pass run after the catch but the goals defense is too good and rallied to the football and make it over here fat brown in the pump again<person player="marcus edwards" race="UNK" position="WR">marcus edwards</person>says stay away from it and it takes a south florida bouncing backwards theyre going to start from the 44 yard line that s only a 26 yard punt from brown go down to the field now and robson will care rob all right pam well the rain starting to fall a <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> bit harder here at raymond <person player="james arnold" race="UNK" position="DB">james</person> stadium and the seats starting to empty out one thing i wonder in this stadium not exactly an intimidating home field presence for usf they talked about not needing a stadium on campus that s what coach leavitt said but as big teams like west virginia and other big team start to come in i wonder whether theyre going to at some point want to have a <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> bit more of a hope the homefield advantage than they have here at raymond <person player="james arnold" race="UNK" position="DB">james</person> not a priority for gym level that s a great first down line but then laying the junior from lake wales florida picked up 14 in the first down and we visited with leavitt the only coach in the nutri of this program which is all of 11 years old and he likes playing in an nfl stadium obviously with france when they come here i know that theyre playing in a stateoftheart security but still an oncampus facility there are very few good substitutions for that yeah and i think maybe down the road aways it might be something that he would warm up to a <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> bit but right now he s pretty happy with the way this situation is set up in the cage there s other knees more pressing on that campus to get the whole thing going better so pretty carry on south virginia williams bounces for six more yards there s the coaching experience at the university of iowa and then a canvas date under bill snyder where he eventually became the defensive coordinator and then 1996 came here is the first head coach first year there was no play just practice and then they went into one doublea and eventually beg wade into one a conference usa and now finally the biggie it s amazing the number of korean on his team all day and go right then and the ball is loose northy graphic dj roping eventually got the fumble but that player had blown up by taylor and he got a great get off i mean he almost you can make a case that he is offsides there he is right there watch how quickly he gets off the ball fan he is just out of there and the tackle there jared carnes had no chance how quick hi lee taylor is off the ball and he met brophy let that thing go before he hit the ground he was actually sitting on taylor so that s a fumble rosy good find the football trying to get a <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> bit of a block and that s somebody away from the ball but it doesnt work and he relaxed up for the big colonel taylor making that possible goal femur form of the ball twice today as<person player="johnny white" race="UNK" position="RB">johnny white</person>the tailback picks up only one on that carry highly fellow senior from laundered north carolina three stats lastly again the university of virginia which turned out to be at 22 years 20 long mentored among others<person player="darius powell" race="UNK" position="DL">darius powell</person>one of the youngsters on that line and in his whole game is the speed and quickness off the ball still undersized down in there 245 pounder doesnt want to get locked up and a chesttochest battle with an offensive lineman before if you can race him around the edge that s what highly favored guy sitting next to there <person player="marvin austin" race="UNK" position="DL">marvin</person> often the very pounds of two freshmen so wrongfully spoken everything up with the funds grunting me well we got him at militia a line a very coachable young man<person player="brandon tate" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brandon tate</person>with the 7 yard catch and there is <person player="marvin austin" race="UNK" position="DL">marvin</person> thompson again some of you thought he might so allamerican game the ought the army ball you thought he was has the children s to it yeah he really was he was the best defensive player regardless of position on the field not here for that allstar game and yeah the thing i like about him just be an infectious nature of his personality for a while but that is free interception for carolina and<person player="ben moffitt" race="UNK" position="LB">ben moffitt</person>is the general of the both defense he may call the call he s always in the right position this is the 33rd career consecutive start so he knows what he s doing back there and here he is that middle linebacker he s just going to read the quarterback i and then basically step right in front of the route intended for<person player="brooks foster" race="UNK" position="WR">brooks foster</person>and then joe i should go back to his old fullback days in high school looking for a down the field putting the ball away and dragging people that was a 42 yard return for <person player="ben moffitt" race="UNK" position="LB">moffitt</person> his first kick of the season and position for that goes in so serapis moon bringing bouncing it outside nowhere to go is he tripped down bomber better than with the tackle and again with carolina to struggle much of the season but to last seven years they have been in the negative turnover margin category and theyre very negative today with a <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> askew game yeah it s kind of problem form something they need to take care of but on the other side of the ball south florida had five takeaways against auburn no points off to those potential ladies they had a takeaway earlier today s game they didnt get points off of this so they need to find a way to make something happen once they get a take away the bulls have not been able to capitalize on that three turnovers now for north carolina all three of them coming on bjp s interception the bulls offense it slow down a <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> bit if north carolina some credit is there theyre theyre playing better because that s the first couple of drives ended up in touchdown wishing for flag of course <person player="taurus johnson" race="UNK" position="WR">johnson</person> he says that he was held by <person player="mark paschal" race="UNK" position="LB">mark</person> pascal and pascal did kind of get on him a <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> bit and grab a hold on them but by the and you can do that you can hit a receiver as long as the ball is not in the air in college football and pascal took advantage of that now<person player="delbert alvarado" race="UNK" position="K">delbert alvarado</person>coming out to attempt yet another field goal he has made both of them today from 32 and 23 yards this one a <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> bit farther away at 40 jim learn if not happy control optimal care at the end of the half but they had to settle for some field goal attempts after scoring touchdowns on their first few conventions of the game he is 3 for 3 and hell go this afternoon but 10 moppet he s married got a couple of kid and he s got an interception in a 42 yard return that set up that last field goal the telecast is being broadcast in high definition available on espn hd presented by pioneer juro hd tv youre watching tailgate week presented by kingsford even though it s raining the spirit that has been dampened by the south florida fans on top of north carolina 2383 and what some great tailgating before the game race as part of that lee roy selmon grapes cough urine sample ephemera buccaneer legend as brandon pate gets the kick off and say always dangerous as a returned man gets it up close to the 40 yard line before he has brought down by <person player="sabbath joseph" race="UNK" position="LB">sabbath</person> <person player="taurus johnson" race="UNK" position="WR">johnson</person> willing to back up linebackers their interfaith certainly one of the best in the history of the acc and career kickoff in fact number 12 alltime which david in charge at north carolina this is his first year as he was an nfl network analyst the last couple of years and there you see his coaching staff a lot of guys who have coached in the high problem yeah six of his nine members of his staff have nfl experience and he thinks that s going to help him maybe accelerate the growth of this program that a good recruiting classes today girls won and that is in capri should have been handled team nick if it was thrown well they had that ray williams one of the challenges quarterbacks for south florida was able to cover him nicely and he was so effective at miami this is staggering he coached 28 firstround nfl draft picks during his years at the university of miami yeah and that s what when we when we spoke to chuck pagano and john shoot the coordinators format one thing they knew they said they knew they were going to get some good football players to coax the birthday that s running the show that s 28 first rounders by the way in six seasons at the head coach of south florida called timeout and moffat the leader coming over to talk things over he s got to pick today and which david s the halcyon days for him certainly when he was a head coach from 1995 to 2000 at miami they won three biggie s titles their final season they went 11 and 1 then he left to go to the browns in the year after he left was when larry coker and company won a national championship at miami all right and people remember which davis is the righthand man of jimmie <person player="taurus johnson" race="UNK" position="WR">johnson</person> for all those years winning super bowls with the cowboys and national championships with the hurricane so he had a nice mentor and you see the accolades for bush at miami this by the way is his first job or his first time back here coaching in the state of florida and he left and he brings in the young north carolina team and he s very excited by the support that he is getting there and all the players were thrilled and anger that he s been hired as offensive coordinator now it was almost picked off again as train williams got a hand on it they were looking for<person player="johnny white" race="UNK" position="RB">johnny white</person>but it was another 5th as we go down to rob simul care while pàmies talking about butch davis is recruiting ability and he s recruited a frigid coaching staff as you guys have mentioned john shook his offensive coordinator was recruited by david a big factor for shoot was the fact that carolina plays on saturday as well of course there are college football team they play on saturday as well she had been coaching in the nfl for many years his wife is an ordained presbyterian minister so he never had a chance to hear her preach so now play in saturday s increase in sunday it works out perfectly for him as his magazine can still in your and down goes he is back<person player="aaron harris" race="UNK" position="DL">aaron harris</person>or smelly terrible all of in convergence and that was a coverage sack because there was nowhere for <person player="tj yates" race="white" position="QB">tj</person> gates to go with the football the initial protection wasnt that bad as the bulls going to run a <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> stunt try and get things going to see that defensive lineman coming around the edge there but nowhere to go with the football and you know being a young quarterback that s one of the things<person player="tj yates" race="white" position="QB">tj yates</person>said he had to work on keeping his eyes down the field as opposed to watching a rushers in king he s got a group coming at you like the bulls doing your eyes will get on that patrick sooner than maybe it s guilt nathan s in fact three times as <person player="marcus edwards" race="UNK" position="WR">marcus</person> edward fields to punt and everett has a nice <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> supergirl estate in front of it dragged down in north carolina territory the elite quarterback and the biggies well talk more about the south florida dancing at conference in return he is here college football rosenberg volkswagen when you get into a volkswagen he kisses eu and john hancock the future is your and he is he and jane flasch these are most college football every saturday to order call your papers he provided at the usf health facility here at the university of south florida in tampa do some research schools and football team with mike for the two freshman tailback getting that carry for 23 3 on north carolina remained honored with the stop for the tar heels the jim levin is the only head coach that this 11 year old program has ever had that score was relatively young 51 years old and a huge enrollment almost 45,000 students yeah used to be considered a big commuter school still is to some extent but there is a lot of people living on campus now and very nice campus get a chance to go over there and visit me it s changed a <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> bit back in the day when this football program started they didnt have any buildings they had this trailer they called it the ponderosa and then when they didnt have lights for their practice they actually used to watch use the headlights from the cars pull them up to the sidelines and pull the lights on let s go boys and theyve come from some humble beginning but they cracked the top 25 for the first time ever leading into this week understandably that when they were recruiting people originally if they wouldnt taken to the football offices they didnt want to know about the old ponderosa cookery shows that one incomplete looking for hester and fourth down now biggie s teams in the top 25 this is how theyre doing west virginia comes in here on friday night easily beating east carolina but look at louisa losing the spiritual worst offensive teams are over on the season and south florida playing right now so boy that would be just a huge win our beef with the spiritual a reinforcer chief is big right now but the beetle clean blood leaves are on the road theyre going for 4,000 in the city back to then rains amigos athlete wrote one point on this drive it was second and one and then the north carolina defense came up big that time is darrell map who was able to get in there and disrupt ben williams and give matt fred and he made a nice play there but ill tell you what the software is didnt get it done on this drive but i believe that they can get it done in the big picture i think that they have a great opportunity to win the buttes and i know that and that s going to be the big one as north carolina gets the football now south florida making some big noise remember last year they were able to go into west virginia now with the west virginia team you know they have some some thoughts about maybe getting you a national championship game they have so much speed on this team and and were going to see that next friday when they play they play west virginia right here right and that s the thing they have the speed on defense to match up with a west virginia offense and that s what makes them really a major threat in the big east the speed on defense and their ability to take things away like a patent light like a seed plate and feed the hungry hunger for this day that s for treating a game towards that one backward as he was going backwards towards<person player="johnny white" race="UNK" position="RB">johnny white</person>another good more good pressure up the middle then <person player="ben moffitt" race="UNK" position="LB">moffitt</person> leading the charge for south florida but take a look at the upcoming schedule for the bowls as they take on west virginia that s a huge one you can see it on espn2 on friday night and they go to florida atlantic in memphis team to beat minnesota and how about rutgers october 18 the msf employee as well yeah at home later make a way to how they do against the big three of the bai respect to their mom samir sections now by <person player="tj yates" race="white" position="QB">tj</person> mom cmere and then moffat and mom premier getting his first chance to really start for this football team and he stepped in and has done the job outstandingly you know they lost their two starting outside linebackers from last year and he stepped in and really they didnt miss a beat and with him and moffat 59 and 53 in there in the kennel stand up behind the line linebackers those guys are outstanding they make plays and each of them have an interception so far today he s aged sitting on the sidelines coach davis come over to say staunton filler and south florida van and good field position first and 10 from the 33 the tailor s rock the ball is momentarily brophy has lost a fumble today for south florida the quarterback but this time the bulls are able to hang on to it let s go back to the studio now in reef davis all right pam you guys been talking about louisville and syracuse and just like that bryant robbed by harry <person player="dylan douglas" race="UNK" position="DB">douglas</person> for the touchdown the closed within seven but just as i was speaking cherokee that just scored again well get to that update in just a <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> bit guy wow and 116th and scoring offense and total offense 117 in rushing offense at 119 in the entire country and they are scoring almost as well today louisa and it shows you how bad that louisville defense is they got great offense but if you cant stop anybody you cant get it done for <person player="taurus johnson" race="UNK" position="WR">johnson</person> with a 14 yard caption at the first down and ill tell you the other biggie team that you have to keep your eye on is in savannah brian <person player="richard kelly" race="UNK" position="RB">kelly</person> has come in there he s got left three and oh right now and dont forget about them theyre going to knock some people off before that thing s open already with some nice wins with <person player="richard kelly" race="UNK" position="RB">kelly</person> came over central michigan south florida team fresh off beating auburn looking at the north carolina or georgia cupid and places way down to the 11 yard line five or mix out eight more yards format first time ever south florida is ranked in the top 25 and look at the big east only the ftc has more teams in the ap top 30 right cincinnati sneaks up in there to give them that fifth member that that s ranked and i talked about it being the big beast and that really theyve come a long way you think back to just as a year ago and everybody was kind of saying all the biggies and i thank you and i think about tell you what that s pretty good that s good tackle this north carolina defense really has buckled it up buckled their chin strap since south florida short on a curse to possession dj <person player="ej wilson" race="UNK" position="DL">wilson</person> and beyonce williams that time coming up to make the stop and that s a push david straight <person player="mark paschal" race="UNK" position="LB">mark</person> you know he s a defensive toe side trade and the first thing you would expect him to be able to impact would be the defense of his football team apparently that s been a the high point in the better unit of this football team thus far this year that would be a power formation for a lot of things for noggin is not more than groceries would just hang onto it and run it himself and he can get close to a first down marker yeah they <person player="mark paschal" race="UNK" position="LB">mark</person> him about a half a yard short and it will be interesting to see if coach leavitt wants to go for this or kick a field goal i think you go for it you need to get the offense going you got another field goal aint going to do a whole lot for you look i think youre thinking hey let s pound this thing in and let s get it going for starting to come on to the field theyre going to wait for the measurement before leavitt makes the final decision theyre going to be a foot or so short unc their defense gave up 15 points with two touchdowns in the first two possessions for south florida last seven possessions only nine points on the three field goal right so they have picked up the pace and now the bowl they send in that three running back they like to run that risk bone in the short yardage situation that s what theyre going to then williams of in there world and<person player="jamar taylor" race="UNK" position="RB">jamar taylor</person>for that a short one also a couple of tight end around the line of scrimmage and run for the first in and that s just a version of an old winky power football way you get three bags in the back view you send the ball to the same spot you got to of a blocking and forward carrying the ball and theyre just able to hammer it in there and get the yardage that they needed and scioscia levin knows he can get it done with those three hot sauces in there running the football and blocking <person player="mark paschal" race="UNK" position="LB">mark</person> taylor cue a nice block on the edge now three tight ends in for south florida<person player="benjamin williams" race="UNK" position="RB">benjamin williams</person>who was a walkon not on scholarship last year was thrust into the starting tailback role because of injury and he s got himself his first touchdown of the day jim lemon has to be happy that it s being an finally able to capitalize on a takeaway they had the intersect with the mom premiere there himself 70 add the extra point florida s first touchdown since the first quarter and it s been williams the junior from lake wales florida taking an end<person player="benjamin williams" race="UNK" position="RB">benjamin williams</person>has just scored on a touchdown roddick 32 three in favor of south florida over north carolina let s check out now our dell playbook for a bevel yeah well go back to that play on fourth down watch<person player="jamar taylor" race="UNK" position="RB">jamar taylor</person>right here he s going to have the key block on the outside right there you see that block that opens up that hole and allows forward to get enough of a scene to get forward and get that first down keeping the drive alive and then they punch it in for the touchdown right after that that is your del play bug to how we cheer at cards in the 17th at the guy who bloody inside for south florida and brandon kate gets to kick off the silicone he s very dangerous houdini down there if you have somehow able to slither his way up to 30 as we go back to reach davis the hangover just dont go away from louisville against syracuse 21 14 i told you 10 is for <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> slips and todd s missing scored on the first play from scrimmage today he s gone again vince eric hughes intercepted a pass and take the field old around 31 14 you can watch the upset rolling right now on espn2 speaking of hangovers nebraska and the third quarter against ball state <person player="nate allen" race="nonwhite" position="DB">nate</person> davis going yet never call state came close to michigan in the big house last year to three point lead wow the glass house was handled very easily by usc this year and at ball state david letterman university right now is beaten up but there s no hangover here for south florida now they had a week to get over there hanging over they are they beat auburn three weeks ago on the road and had a bye week which really i think worked out well in their favor gave them a chance to get focused and get ready to play this north carolina and it s golf or a tweener game because friday west virginia coming to town is<person player="ryan houston" race="UNK" position="RB">ryan

for north carolina john chute said theyre trying to find the guy in the backfield cause right now it s sort of a running back by committee yeah and they were hoping that<person player="johnny white" race="UNK" position="RB">johnny white</person>would be that guy the rest her freshman kind of led the team in carries with 38 coming in and they gave him the bulk of gary s against virginia and previous week but he just really hasnt had the breakout game for there theyre searching now<person player="johnny white" race="UNK" position="RB">johnny white</person>again if you can take the break again looking to cry and he goes down again for the fourth time today yay is that jared blue number 90 all six for 250 pounds of them on top good pressure up the middle two by richard kliebert the strongest man on the football field as you see the facemask all is going to go against the bulls and negate that sack <person player="tj yates" race="white" position="QB">yates</person> has suffered a lot of pressure today salvy with his fashion nation leading six and a half sacks and then you think couple more facts and getting chased around by leave it right there he kicked in himself he gets on top of that one again and that he fence in front as you see the numbers on <person player="tj yates" race="white" position="QB">yates</person> and the pressure he s been under and the 450 on the bottom but that for left line that man selby is outstanding for the bears as good as anybody in the country a pass i grew on that fashion on second and short<person player="ryan houston" race="UNK" position="RB">ryan houston</person>again gets the carry and he has tackled inside the five we have not mentioned yet that <person player="scott lenahan" race="UNK" position="OL">scott</person> linehan who s a very good spinner the starting center for north carolina did not make the trip today he is back home and georgia because his grandma passed away earlier this week so the goal is obviously often to linehan family and low iron getting into play center the guy that makes the toys out there that s better very fiddly keeping a very good george shelby can also loose the country and tackles for loss and that time he gets<person player="ryan houston" race="UNK" position="RB">ryan houston</person>in the backfield and so he s going to be right up here and watch him get off the ball and get the great penetration bam he splits the block aright there another tackle for a loss his fourth of the day he s got 13 and a half tackles for loss in just two and threequarter <person player="james arnold" race="UNK" position="DB">james</person> that s amazing for you second goal cool receivers in for weight gets up through the pressure and he has taken down just inside the 5yard line<person player="woody george" race="UNK" position="DL">woody george</person>senior from belle glade florida who made 10 starts last year and now as a reserve made the top so the third quarter comes to a close butch davis looking forward to the fourth obviously the block for a scheme to punch it in has something positive today north carolina start this fourth quarter going right into that they are women screaming that time didnt help and theyve got to have a silent snap on that one oh you know youre down in there you got to use his hands up his hey what do you want me to do oh yeah a few a science the quarterback that s the bathroom again fly through there how do you not block george spelvin he s all over the feelings penetrate in the backfield and yet they still dont get it here he is right there and he just gets an inside move and that s how we got in there because usually he s an outsider he very seldom will come inside but he hit on that one save it for the perfect time and he got himself in third back of the day eight and a half 14 gold today but that farm equipment bringing in the ball goes over on down the bowl boy he threaded his 12th man here for south florida that will because carolina head and i have two five inside the five ready to punch it in and the crowd got to move back to that penalties in the sack fight valving and then the nice play by williamson the defense comes up big and closes the door on north carolina jim as you know he s a defensive guy in defensive coordinator kansas state before he came here and now <person player="matt grothe"

there and nebraskan ball fair ball jay has taken the 1714 leads and propellers fine john hill and hell score and the children of the corn have a fourpoint lead but it s getting deep in the third i read when going on in lincoln between those two ball clubs we saw some fan here in south florida had a tshirt for tim tebow as a quarterback now for florida it said <person player="matt grothe" race="UNK" position="QB">grothe</person> is greater had the greaterthan symbol back then tebow which most people would disapprove is certainly down the gainesville area but broken with a lot of fans that was definitely a south florida green tshirt we saw him here that s a good conversation right there he could go for a long way been debating that has to sort some things out down on the field and again grow these it s all smiles it s a sophomore from lakeland florida very biggie its rookie of the year sporting news allamerican all honorable mention all the way across the board really got thrust in their pam you know he wasnt the starter starting out but theyll well let them figure things out on the field meanwhile the titans are taking on the state this monday night vince young and reggie bush meet again here s mike tirico vince young is dynamic and excited and brought the energy back to the titans branch job drew brees had a dream season 2050 and reggie bush tried to find the state pageant as they return home saints like 8:30 eastern on espn sunday night football so it s fun to do a game in new orleans there s a story line is how about the same tables in giants all winless the text in lyon the lines are general are you kidding me did you believe that eating the vikings in overtime larry <person player="taurus johnson" race="UNK" position="WR">johnson</person> wants 40 carries tomorrow he has no rushing touchdowns and byron leftwich and tank johnston on two new teams biron going to atlanta after he was let go by <person player="amarri jackson" race="UNK" position="WR">jackson</person> them and what the cowboys got saying see how okay mines in business down there the problem here the delay was over the wick will being blown on the sidelines they had to get rid of that thing there s a difficult macular communication by<person player="grant gregory" race="UNK" position="QB">grant gregory</person>as he run 40 yards for the first down physically theyre very similar<person player="grant gregory" race="UNK" position="QB">grant gregory</person>maybe a few pounds lighter and an inch or two taller but very look very similar this is a to fake the look outside sister quarterback draw and he showed you some explosion as well <person player="grant gregory" race="UNK" position="QB">gregory</person> transferred from indiana his dad greg the offensive coordinator said he looked not only south florida but also you accused in the university of maryland and decided to come here away from highly tailored a few more feel good defensive lineman for carolina and you so the <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> <person player="mark paschal" race="UNK" position="LB">mark</person> there by throwing it away and good quickness then again that same move of avoiding the rush where you just turn around turn your back it s a flip turn you call it really if youre covering somebody but that s that s something that they practice each and every day and watching he s going to play here fan turn his back in lung get away from that guy because he s jason that s<person player="marvin austin" race="UNK" position="DL">marvin austin</person>trying to run him down that s the drill that they do every day with their quarterbacks the kids used to escaping did just that now second and ten most of the fourth quarter left to go <person player="grant gregory" race="UNK" position="QB">gregory</person> with illustrate hands on julie <person player="trimane goddard" race="UNK" position="DB">goddard</person> makes her stop after a yard game <person player="grant gregory" race="UNK" position="QB">gregory</person> from athens ohio but he is one of the few non floridians on this how florida football team added staggering yeah that s just amazing but that s one thing that jim leavitt wanted to do is build a floridabased program and why not because there is such an amazing amount of talent down here in the great state of florida and know there s enough for everybody down here and that s why everybody comes down here recruit between the state teams and joe <person player="grant gregory" race="UNK" position="QB">grant</person> have an advantage to get those guys regularly now being pursued and hangs on to it as he was being chased by <person player="ej wilson" race="UNK" position="DL">ej</person> welcome because which davis had a nice stronghold in here when he was a head coach of miami and and he he certainly he would think would who still have some good recruiting ties in this state oh you betcha he does and he s going to take full advantage of them and you know everybody knows where the great high school football is played and florida texas those kind of states everybody every major town can to come in the state competitor three field goal free for three also doing the punting brandon runs an a from it and south florida covers it perfectly the ball is killed inside the one yard line a 51yard punt by <person player="delbert alvarado" race="UNK" position="K">alvarado</person> and straight williams the talons at center back using the scheme to kill the ball to 1 and the speed on the special team takes over for the bowls once again the big 32 three lead over north carolina and the guard mules are pinned back programs with great play down the front inside the 1 and the open their themes and give themselves out of the bowl florida watch mistake they got the first theme defensive there s evil is the fourth quarter he flies himself about three yards and he plunges forward richard freshman quarterback has had a tough day through the air as he has thrown four interceptions north carolina which that play has finally gone over 100 yards of offense total yeah and this is the best defense that they have seen by far and they kind of realize this gives them a good measuring stick for coach davis as far as how far do we really have to go and i think they understand a <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> bit the problems that they have on offense and the need to give something more explosive explosive type players in there and their quarterback is going to come along you know i watched him on film coming in here and i thought he had a chance to maybe make some plays here but for dean class adjust that s too good carolina has been looking for a quarterback for a long time <person player="ej wilson" race="UNK" position="DL">ej</person> s closet i know yeah there was some confusion and it wasnt the formation he wanted and <person player="bobby rome" race="UNK" position="RB">bobby</person> roma s fullback he was trying to get him to move but just had to take his time out so both teams with a couple of timeouts left to go so plenty of time left to go in the fourth quarter but great badly he doesnt need any more time we have raised bentley award winner has player of the game coming up in south florida reaction yay close it looking for this hold back <person player="bobby rome" race="UNK" position="RB">bobby</person> roll now it s going to be third and eight theyll be again with the boy did he have to get rid of it in a hurry because george salvi was just flatout i come and there he is at the bottom of the screen again just running past it now you got a fullback that you want to try a tailback you want to try and block selby with and that s really how to match up that favors you because george selby will just a mileage back you try to put it back on and the good news for <person player="tj yates" race="white" position="QB">tj</person> made this filthy run a sideline oh god 75 oh go further that was leo fall start the play clock was had run out anyway and there is george salvi s hydrating getting ready to go back in there as you smile excuse me raised in for now and when we spoke with we asked him what are you weighing right now fella 345 but the dosage is not about 333 imagine if he was 260 and he looked it up there he s taken in by his team nick but<person player="mike jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mike jenkins</person>were very talented corners they have a couple of amir and jenkins and trey williams was whipping a step for step and jenkins gets nice cover later working on it right here and jenkins has the inside position and he works the hands and he knocks it away from <person player="hakeem nicks" race="nonwhite" position="WR">hakeem</person> nicked at the end now im sorry north carolina going to punch someone deep deep deep in the end i was going to say pan i like the play call though you know you back up like that what the heck just try for you try for home run market <person player="marcus edwards" race="UNK" position="WR">edwards</person> is waiting on the north carolina side of the field on the 45 the cameras brown point short kick fielded at the 39 he flips up basically by his own guy as<person player="mike jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mike jenkins</person>down there with a good block for edward good field position for south florida and weve done it all year it is your player of the week raid bentley award goes to george salvi and what a game he has had three sacks on the day five tackles four tackles for loss look at the season numbers down there on the bottom he s got eight and a half sacks 13 in the half tackles for loss and he s been doing it all night tonight here s his bat early on the first one he got he s making the plays in the backfield against the run as well fati : i like playing the run better than getting after the quarterback well he played pretty good job at balls and to me he s the best player on the field here today and that s why he wins the bentley award some of the reserves getting in now is patrick richard and him in for the first time and he catches a four yard pass as bentley the bentley s of course beautiful cars and hope that was up what in troy michigan it s a bentley dealer up there let you know when theyre those werent actually my automobile which worked for john right but certainly did the trick for that and selby certainly is well deserving of that award this defense has been unbelievable for south florida today asking <person player="aston samuels" race="UNK" position="WR">samuels</person> of which would freshmen from dull blade florida gets the carry and picks up three defense today five sacks for interceptions it s allowed only 150 yards three points and an amazing and that s what to me the backbone of this team is you can talk a lot about matt trophy and what he s able to do for the offense and they do a lot of good things on that side of the ball but if the bowls are going to contend in the big east and i believe they are because they can play defense and matchup with the west the gin is the louisville s in the rushes 33 daniels with another carry to get the first down <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> guy speed <person player="aston samuels" race="UNK" position="WR">samuels</person> listen at 510 176 picks up 15 about florida now over 400 yards of offense for the game let s take another look at our game track presented by john hancock and you can see the numbers who disparity between <person player="matt grothe" race="UNK" position="QB">grothe</person> and <person player="tj yates" race="white" position="QB">yates</person> and of course support takeaways for south florida leading to 13 point that s a good sign for them they had five takeaways to get to auburn and didnt get any points out of it so they were able to capitalize on the takeaways today a couple of interceptions by their linebackers mom premier and moppet getting the job done in the middle there samuel is gifted yet another carry and picks up six more yards for the bull keep it on the ground trying to kill the clock a <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> bit theyre still chewing up some yardage again friday night yes the end to west virginia will be right here at 8:00 eastern time the battle between those two teams west virginia with revenge on his mind from last year because they got beaten by the team in morgantown as <person player="grant gregory" race="UNK" position="QB">gregory</person> slithers close to another first down look another update now from brief there and the black shirts of nebraska are being gutted by the number one offense in the maxval face down 28 2014 abrasca <person player="nate allen" race="nonwhite" position="DB">nate</person> davis look how far this ball goes on the air and it s perfectly <person player="jermaine strong" race="UNK" position="DB">strong</person> that dante <person player="aj love" race="UNK" position="WR">love</person> ball state head into the fourth quarter they have the lead in late unbelievable through that s from his own 32 but what 55 yards or so in the air it s a mule gets it again from terrific football games well you never know do you i think it s great as a football fan to see some traditional bps powers who are a <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> blue ball stayed in what muncie indiana and playing in lincoln like that who define if that would ever happen nobody except maybe ball state least of all the big red fans who are probably not too thrilled right now three running back then fourth and one at for masonry fault earlier were under the pier they gave it to mike scored the biggest guy in the backfield and he does pick up the south florida first down and they have other wrinkles out of that formation but they havent needed to use them as of yet theyve run that same power play off to the right side every time theyve been in that formation and they still keep picking up the needed yardage for the true freshman from sarasota florida has been much travel if youre going to measure this one pam i thought they got it and on first flush but they will make sure yeah im going to agree with you i think they got it you see that blue line electronically generated and theyre not evil died im going to be alive on that one so another first down and it is first and goal from the seven yard line for south florida butch davis trying to build this program up at north carolina very excited about getting your opportunity to coach at this institution which he wants to prove is not just for basketball once again samuel inching closer to another touchdown beyonce williams has had a good game he s made nine stops from his safety spot this afternoon you know we had a nice conversation with jim leavitt that s too brief for me i would <person player="aj love" race="UNK" position="WR">love</person> to spend more time with him but he struck me as the most honest <person player="quinton person" race="UNK" position="DB">person</person> and sincere <person player="quinton person" race="UNK" position="DB">person</person> ive ever met and he talked about things and you know said he said some things where some guys would say and he s kind of saying i yeah whatever coach had just given us the line but he is authentic and i really think that he probably is like an eight linking i never told a lie whole life he strike me as one of those guys i can see why he is so successful here and then had it and dropped it <person player="grant gregory" race="UNK" position="QB">gregory</person> hahn the roll out and hell who made a spectacular catch earlier in this game can bring that one in that was too easy for him nobody hanging on he didnt have to jump out of the stadium to get it this was just the perfect <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> office throw from<person player="grant gregory" race="UNK" position="QB">grant gregory</person>so it s kind of disappointing had a chance to get his first touchdown fat as a bowling it s just taking your eyes off the ball before it s time to do so and<person player="cedric hill" race="UNK" position="TE">cedric hill</person>put that one go now the warning we women and into tomorrow hammer and hammer hammer to the corner of the endzone for the touchdown and through freshmen with his second floor on the ground this year i told you they could run it the other way out of that formation and sure enough they with the bounce out shows you the speed get to the edge get the touchdown all free tailbacks that has been featured today by south florida for williams and taylor have russian clutch back and that s a heck of a stable of back that jim dunn it has to go through there butch davis it probably is too deep our one of our dojo looks like all three as <person player="delbert alvarado" race="UNK" position="K">alvarado</person> punches group evans point of the afternoon to the bowl college football is presented by carscom find the right card for you carscom and in part by sonic its message to each sonic youth til hitting week and there s a commission for tailgating and a lot of space painting that difficult dangerous yeah you wont catch me doing that he s putting him in the face because literary stuff said while we were gone south florida their son exploring drive it was an easy pin played 38 yards culminating with a<person player="jamar taylor" race="UNK" position="RB">jamar taylor</person>one yard touchdown run there were clothes on the first extra point attempt they moving back 10 yards and <person player="delbert alvarado" race="UNK" position="K">alvarado</person> kicks it in anyway so you missed the true extra point but it s still through derivative three bottom line and jim leavitt now can start looking forward to friday night s game against west virginia and that will be a big one in fact they expect to break the attendance record here which was bet their first game from 49,000 cloth it sold almost 50,000 tickets so far to that west virginia game and im betting after the hype of this one in this the big east showdown and all the things that they might sell this place out 37,000 people were here earlier in the game today is <person player="brandon tate" race="nonwhite" position="WR">tate</person> gets the kick up to the 37 yard line and time for another update was reached there two three ham louisville mike just being done at home against syracuse down 31 21 andrew <person player="chris robinson" race="UNK" position="LB">robinson</person> to mike william eight and change to go it s 38:21 wiggles down by 17 lord and ole miss and coach osteen wont go away seth adam s bechet hodge cuts down rebels 27:16 there thank you very much reef so louisville had once 20 straight against syracuse is dreadful offensive if i figure that not necessarily they put them right in but it s a shocking result of their removal it s unbelievable sister down the robbed down was an inspirational story surrounding the bulls all right pam well usf finishing this game <person player="jermaine strong" race="UNK" position="DB">strong</person> here today and that is a motto of this team finish <person player="jermaine strong" race="UNK" position="DB">strong</person> they have these bracelets and of course a lot of us are familiar with the yellow lance armstrong livestrong bracelets well these bracelets are inspired by a man named jeff wagner who is a usf alumnus and he is fighting leukemia for the second time in his life he was very involved in getting a football program here at usf and when he found out he had leukemia again he said if he wanted to achieve some twenty calls big monstrous audacious goal one of those goals was to try to help usf football any new coach levitt from the time levitt was hired here and invited the church with him one day told him about his battle told him about a desire to help out well coach levitt was touched and what that story to his team last week for two weeks ago i should say right before that big win at all were talked about finishing <person player="jermaine strong" race="UNK" position="DB">strong</person> which is wagner s motto and it has had a huge impact to look along the sideline here and just about every player assistant staff member is wearing this black break thank you rogers on third and he s able to run for the first down and jeff wagner is such an in such an inspiration and coach 11 we talked about the sincerity with which he speaks he said this wasnt necessarily wanted to fire him up for the auburn game but it was the message he wanted to get across he if the meaning to do it and the timing just turned out feel free good timing because they go out the next day and they gave offering in alabama yeah and it fits into what he claims his number one goal that is to impact here from this area impact their life and teach them things about life and he brought that thing in last year he had in his mind edward maybe motivated football team but i believe him when he says that the most important thing was it s a life lesson and how you do have to finish <person player="jermaine strong" race="UNK" position="DB">strong</person> and it doesnt matter what happened yesterday you still have to fight to the end to try and make things happen while youre down here on the surface it was a great message to a football team and i think it s a and im standing way to get people motivated this team has been very impressive today<person player="bobby rome" race="UNK" position="RB">bobby rome</person>the fullback runs the first down or north carolina coming on later today about 17 minutes from now on abc joe paterno and his nittany lions go to ann arbor to take on michigan college football presented by best five part of tailgating week

kickoff michigan with a much needed win over notre dame last week i got to deal with the nittany lion michigan has never lost three games before october 1st in their entire history i am houston with another carry and they are going to be taking on penn state for the big ten is that sacking have to be very interesting i think if there was good or but interesting looky here yeah they still have some teams that are unblemished as of yet in ohio state still a goodlooking football team and you know i think that michigan state is a <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> bit of a surprise the wolverines dont count them out yeah i think jo for town has an extra football well find out here in a <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> bit man but they win now i want to get michigan to get that monkey off their back and it kind of makes them one of the co favorites dont forget about wisconsin either<person player="ryan houston" race="UNK" position="RB">ryan houston</person>has continued to make an impact here in the second half purdue taking on theyll be taking on another day up next week michigan state has them today look at the bulls fans i got that body paint and theyre headed out for some more tailgating on the field in week and it is absolutely here at florida yay fess up play from poor kick he s battling from six yards for another north carolina first down and this has been a good experience for pj through part of his maturation process as the quarterback for the blue and you know youre going to player youre going to run into a bigger dog sometimes in south florida was definitely a bigger dog here today and for his life never did get comfortable we never saw him really get comfortable and you can see hittin just 10 or 20 caring for houston hit the down around the 11 yard line north carolina coming up in the next couple of weeks so they travel to blacksburg to take off the jigna tech next week and then they are home to miami and then south carolina comes the championship the last three weeks going to be tough for butch and company and i believe butch will get this thing up and running where he wants it and you know he did have a great recruiting classes first year in a short amount of time all right earlier goldmine there a chance to really have a great program all was completed for close down around the 5yard line edie <person player="ed barham" race="UNK" position="TE">barham</person> richard freshman from bacon s councils virginia his first catch of the day good for seven yards cjh rupee be the chosen one north carolina has been through a lot of quarterbacks over the years and amazingly only one has played that position in the national safari with all that time got them catastrophic losses denver in miami in the eighties that s it that is an amazing statistic and all the years of football history there had never sent a quarterback to the nfl for more than a cup of coffee those ronald curry has had a great career he was the carolina quarterback but he never supported of a wide receiver now the most successful quarterback in the nfl and carolina history is a receiver in the nfl the h was impressive on on film when i watched him in preparation for this game and he just hasnt shown that today and i think that s a testament to the bull defense as you see some of the passing leaders the history of the power hill and <person player="tj yates" race="white" position="QB">tj</person> because those retro freshmen hopes to a football these guys darian durant are very solid collegiate career but a lot of those name unless youre like a real a 55foot ball geek you might have got comedy style again curry the second sets quarterback particularly in north carolina history has had a great career as a receiver 50 generates seen a guy at carolina football fans have been waiting for that houston dancing though into the end zone for the north carolina touchdown and you should shown a <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> something there and does that run alone i think youre going to see him get more looks and more opportunities in the tar heel offense because<person player="johnny white" race="UNK" position="RB">johnny white</person>who started today and had the bulk of the carries really never showed us a big flash or the ability to make a play on his own and i think houston kind of makes this one happened by himself <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> bit look at a cut there the good vision then the power the cutback and he made four guys miss lawson hat and still got in the end zone easton stick to 245 foot side and he has this opportunity well given the chance carry the bulk that has carried here in the fourth quarter and <person player="connor barth" race="white" position="K">connor</person> bart gets the extra point there is houston 11 carries 43 yards and that touchdown and a welldeserved pat on the back for houston as carolina scores in 59 minutes to score touchdown but they if they have done it well next we were going to travel to new orleans for a great battle lt takes on from lane to lane to start the season they play southeastern louisiana today then there s lsu threeandoh ranks second the poles play south carolina day lsu has given seven points in its first three games i am really looking forward to seeing that im used angle defense yeah that s going to be an exciting one to go watch as you see the ap top ten and he s seen west virginia in there at number five winning handily today dont forget they played at south florida team here this coming friday that s going to be a big one it really is an opportunity for south florida who came in this week ranked 23rd in the country could really bump off that list maybe get themselves into that top 10 next week noon eastern time 11:00 am louisiana time on espn2 great opportunity to lsu on our air for all of us matt brophy has had a smiling face for yeah like an old west gun sling played by going to <person player="matt grothe" race="UNK" position="QB">grothe</person> also another young quarterback that s so impressive about him what the big e s rookie of the year last year as a freshman so he s only a sophomore mates there s only a redshirt freshman on the other side of the ball the carolina so future looking good and george salvi brave bentley award winner is a sophomore as well man we should we broke up got some serious sophomores on this football squad south florida was not ready to with the hands team as carolina set up to kick an onside kick so the bulls had to use that timeout to make sure they had the right personnel on their forward out of timeouts as you see on your screen the yellow indicators under north carolina showing they have two timeouts left south florida all gray they have none that s like that so <person player="matt grothe" race="UNK" position="QB">grothe</person> and a selvi a couple of sophomores who had great day unbelievable days and the punch down past early on to his receiver <person player="amarri jackson" race="UNK" position="WR">jackson</person> so another one there hill goes up and makes the catch there and then the big smile from the gunslinger and in george salvi what a day was even he has had far three sack today for tackles for loss five tackles in the ballgame he leads the nation in sacks with eight and a half and thirteen and a half tackles for loss so that s in three ball games those are some pretty good numbers and most other guys to play for ballgames they had to buy last week for just three for him and the onside kick goes out of down so south florida is going to hang on to it from a 42 yard line and let s take a look at these statistical evidence of how of these two two guys today the only negatives were brophy he did lose a couple of fumbles but showing how dangerous he is through the air and on the ground and he had three passes dropped so he should have been right around 66% on the day and then there s my guy george salvi who was a pleasure to talk to a former center played center in high school when he came here they had him at center for about 20 minutes and then most people over there to defense when he shows that explosiveness and boys can he get off the football and put some pressure on a tackle in a hurry he actually liked playing center in high school high school coach comment about that most guys who sighs wanted her to know he played bachelors vo tailback quarterback into the ball but he was fine playing center and he said he was very much influenced by his parents wouldnt let him play ball unless his grades were right got himself a scholarship here and he is he had such a special player when wait till he packs a <person player="greg little" race="UNK" position="WR">little</person> weight on what a beach he s going to be because he s got that first step that get off as good as anybody ive seen and when you can do that you put pressure on an offense immediately and then if you can bring some power with that and you know get it up to around 260 and maintain that speed and you become a monster not that he isnt right now last year as a freshman he said he had to take a lot of peptobismol because he would get so agitated before game and now he s i think the opposing guy there where they see george stall they want a wonderful performance by del v and rosy now for to beat north carolina
