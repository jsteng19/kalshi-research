place but were going to be homes were going to be excited and were going to bring the intensity the player you know you try to look at another team weekly but licking it off and they really dont have a lot of week we run the challenge it s competition and we look at them all to say you are looking live at boone pickens stadium and stillwater oklahoma where the bedlam series wraps up the big 12 regular season on saturday night football on abc presented by southwest airlines so two rivals and neighbors come together here in stillwater oklahoma all right number three and the bps home of a state number 12 here is our story line tonight if the sooners win there will be a threeway tie for first to the big 12 south at the highest bcs ranked team would advance but if oklahoma state wins tie between texas texas tech remember head to head on a two teams i that was said of texas tech to play missouri knicks saturday night love everybody return fire nice to have you along witness here again and i saw you the texas tech was struggling you were down a field with coach bob stoops oklahoma it was ironic im on the field a couple hours before the game baylor s upsetting texas tech bomb suits of keeping scores with his phone kill gun ds a it s tied up now it s twenty eight to twenty eight and needless to say theyre pretty happy with the end result because now they feel they control their own destiny you know we normally come in to the big toe talking about quarterbacks yeah but i think there are a couple of running backs who could decide this one it s going to be exciting to see these two play especially it start with<person player="demarco murray" race="nonwhite" position="RB">demarco murray</person>we saw him last week and what he was able to do against texas tech for the last five games since the texas game the offensive line taking control of things look at there s almost seven yards that carry more confidence than the knee injury that he sustained a year ago look for him tonight early in this game to get the offense going on the other side for the cowboys<person player="kendall hunter" race="UNK" position="RB">kendall hunter</person>number 24 an explosive back very important the spread look the cowboys like to spread you out and run the football and<person player="kendall hunter" race="UNK" position="RB">kendall hunter</person>has to take the pressure off of his quarterback zach robinson by trying to get upfield to making some big plays any chance that oklahoma was looking too carefully at the bcs and overlooked oklahoma state absolutely not i think they proved that last week with the way they handled texas tech all this all the distractions on the outside bob stoops does as good a job as anybody of keeping his team focused and not even worrying about style points theyre worried about winning this game and doing the best they can tonight against the opponent not only unless they win but style points wouldnt hurt in the bcs battle with the longhorns either and im sure big john and the gang will have some of those details and theyll also tell you what went on and a very busy saturday both crayon youre watching espn on abc this espn telecast

about stoops it has not been easy here all right you can see how he has struggled by six points and by three points the last two wins in here and then in 2002 he was beaten by ten points now stoops and the sooners do hold a five game winning streak<person player="dan bailey" race="white" position="K">dan bailey</person>look at all on the day nothing repellent books fielded at the 4yard on by<person player="demarco murray" race="nonwhite" position="RB">demarco murray</person>the outstanding running back and he stumbles and is down at the 26 yard line certainly wanted no use impact

of receivers that if you paid too much attention to <person player="demarco murray" race="nonwhite" position="RB">murray</person> he can beat you and <person player="jermaine gresham" race="nonwhite"

look after the penalty bring up backer on it and sam completes his first pass to<person player="jermaine gresham" race="nonwhite" position="TE">jermaine gresham</person>the junior tight end from ardmore oklahoma and levine that the line doctor was all over and be a big part of this game that ive seen you taking tackle well it s paid sam brad from one of the hottest quarterback if not be honnest quarterback in the country put up big numbers last week does a great job of controlling this no huddle uptempo offense for the sooners some time to give you a look like theyre hurrying this time look to appear to be that theyre hurrying and of course looks over to get to check tim beckman is changing everything on every play defensively for the cowboys the third different look deflected incomplete and itll be third down and 15 coming up on the play now this is one thing that texas tech did not do much of last week if you were with this last week and herbie you certainly remember they sat in face most of the game beckman s going to mix it up he s going to bring blitzers he s going to put three down like he is right now sometimes only two down <person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">bradford</person> going long double team toes coverage and complete <person player="juaquin iglesias" race="nonwhite" position="WR">iglesias</person> took a shot at it and <person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">bradford</person> attack double coverage and boys and girls that three it out that s something we didnt see much at all last week by oklahoma at home against texas tech third down this is actually a poor decision his only ally he s going to go downfield throw into double pufnstuf to a1 he somehow gets this football in between lacy and the safety moore and his way pious almost comes down with that catch<person player="dez bryant" race="nonwhite" position="WR">dez bryant</person>awaits this punt from mike no booms it drives desk back to the 27 where he makes the fair catch and now we will see who zach robinson has for impact personnel<person player="kendall hunter" race="UNK" position="RB">kendall hunter</person>we talked about him in the open brent number 24 the sophomore has done a great job within this office great acceleration and youll see what we mean here and a little bit he s going to have a big night<person player="dez bryant" race="nonwhite" position="WR">dez bryant</person>can<person player="dez bryant" race="nonwhite" position="WR">dez bryant</person>step up in a big game against a quality opponent that s the challenge that his coaches acquitted on him and of course<person player="brandon pettigrew" race="nonwhite" position="TE">brandon pettigrew</person>very very gifted future firstround tynan great sides theyll look to try to get him over the middle of the sooner defense coach gundy opens with an empty backfield and<person player="kendall hunter" race="UNK" position="RB">kendall hunter</person>is in the slot to the right he is a fine receiver to pour down for the öyou defense the offensive line holds beautifully and he completes the first flight to davis out to the 41 yard line damien davis number 85 but what was more impressive about that play is the fact that the öyou defensive line did not break through time to throw the football be big for zach robinson against to give the defensive line from oklahoma interesting they go away from <person player="brandon pettigrew" race="nonwhite" position="TE">pettigrew</person> away from<person player="dez bryant" race="nonwhite" position="WR">dez bryant</person>and they go to damien davis who only has 11 catches on the year they now will use <person player="keith toston" race="UNK" position="RB">keith</person> poston number another fine tailback with<person player="kendall hunter" race="UNK" position="RB">kendall hunter</person>so they now bring king runningbacks mike gundy of course directing the offense and they line up in a pistol it s just a shorter shotgun formation and theyre going to pump up and zack pounces on the ball option football tonight will be a big part of how the cowboys try to attack the gifted sooners front seven because they want to try to get them out in space and take advantage of how aggressive the sooners are but youve got to be able to hold on to the football and it s about execution and discipline when you play option football they will be strong or the tight inside to the right youll get down a three point to help block the very talented defensive line zack roll the pocket picked off is it a pick six no down at the 21 is <person player="dominique franks" race="UNK" position="DB">dominique</person> crank a poor decision by zack on the roll a fourth row here buyback robinson has an open receiver to the inside actually in connor makes the decision i think prematurely and fold the ball to the outside and dominick frank who s having a huge here for the sooners is right there to step in front of the late row by robinson it makes a big interception here for the sooners sack save the punch down as we got over it made the stop on the play <person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">bradford</person> and the sooners have been lethal glory looking for a steam into the red zone this is where oklahoma has been is impressive as any team we have seen this year in football it s in the red zone 15 cowboys have what it takes to you said brent mixandmatch move people around coming with <person player="demarco murray" race="nonwhite" position="RB">murray</person> again you on the fort first<person player="demarco murray" race="nonwhite" position="RB">demarco murray</person>with the game s first score this is this offensive line this is exactly what theyre able to do even with the penetration there by the big fella on the inside there <person player="jeray chatham" race="UNK" position="DL">chatham</person> they still hit a crease he can get up there so quickly with the montgomery the smallest man on the sooners shimmy and steven adds the extra point seven nothing sigh relief for students a turnover and a quick strike youre watching saturday night football on abc well thurman thomas a legend here going into the college football hall of fame already in the pro football hall of fame one of the great running backs of all time have any level he was good enough were for about a year and a half he kept somebody by the name of barry sanders on the oklahoma state bench that made me more impressive to think think about that they accomplished their norlin with the ball on the deep of the sooners that s hard to the left not a good decision they left his blocking buddies and he was naked out there go back to the interception that s what i talked about earlier it comes down to the quarterback early in a game you have to be careful for that matter any time with a quarterback you have to be careful pre determining where you want to go with a football look at connor to the inside and of course robinson throws late decide to go to the outside what a great job of jumping it by dominic <person player="dominique franks" race="UNK" position="DB">franks</person> and all the sudden sooners who went for an out got great field position thanks to the defense may took advantage of it was a big run by<person player="demarco murray" race="nonwhite" position="RB">demarco murray</person>s now the cowboys will start from inside their own 15 crusher is<person player="dez bryant" race="nonwhite" position="WR">dez bryant</person>got a first object game involved early remember when we were down in lubbock a few weeks ago they did not get <person player="dez bryant" race="nonwhite" position="WR">dez</person> fried involved in the first half of the game and you know how tough it is when bigtime talented receivers are are not in the game the influence of her humidity has not stepped out in the biggest games for the cowboys maybe this will get him involved early in the game to get his confidence on attack robinson talking about confidence after the interception important for him to come back and throw that pass to get his confidence back this pickle <person player="kendall hunter" race="UNK" position="RB">hunter</person> he s a fine runner great decision steps to the outside jackson the quarter is over there and weve got a flag on the play terkel pal fake fan facility first down there s a good look at the facemask penalty as <person player="kendall hunter" race="UNK" position="RB">kendall</person> makes a good decision and jackson reaches up and grabs the facemask we dont the home estate now to take advantage some execution a big break here the 15 yard down it onto the back end of that play junior <person player="keith toston" race="UNK" position="RB">keith</person> koston he s one of the texan he s now the running back home estate will show the read option you can see how efficient that oklahoma team is in the first quarter like suing for toastin matt winer let s check in for our first update tonight matt how you doing thanks again and dont forget ill keep you in the know throughout the game beginning with this taco <person player="tj bell" race="UNK" position="DB">bell</person> update notre dame and usd mark sanchez through early interception irish couldnt convert they come back with a 79 yard drive stamp on johnson there organ taking such a rose bowl berth that i betrayal oregon 20 been so a couple field goals have been tacked on since down some has reported that first storm that s going on in corvallis oregon the home with the beavers zach with that inside shuttle pass and it was read beautifully by the defensive line and<person player="adrian taylor" race="UNK" position="DL">adrian taylor</person>one of their fine defensive tackles outstanding athlete browser say you talked about bedlam how loud it can be one thing you have to do if youre oklahoma state is believe that you can win you need success early against oklahoma and you throw an interception you get down seven and us remember oklahoma dominates opponents in the first quarter this drive is important to zach robinson and the cowboys you see if brent venables toastin is a running back he would be the protector and it s brought back in 12 nobody touches him down middle davis again his second catch of the game davis still on his feet to the 19 yard line venables is going to have to think about bringing some heat the offensive line in the cowboys is doing an excellent job 25 yard game and disguised and mixing some things up but give all the credit in the world here to the receiver damion davis getting a move to the inside he had a linebacker and<person player="keenan clayton" race="UNK" position="DB">keenan clayton</person>matched up with him oneonone plenty of room to work back to the middle we gave him an outside move back to the middle and a great throw by that to the <person player="kendall hunter" race="UNK" position="RB">hunter</person> back on the field playaction in trouble throws incomplete and broken up by nick <person player="nic harris" race="UNK" position="DB">harris</person> the safety who came over in dunn time venables and the sooners finally got to him and ruffled the quarterbacks feathers a little bit but instead of bringing zone pressure when you bring four or five this time it was an allout blitz and brent venables defensive coordinator from the sooners brent he said okay now theyre in the red zone let s start to be aggressive let s attack them and try to take the fight to them and let instead of letting them attack us there were<person player="dez bryant" race="nonwhite" position="WR">dez bryant</person>this is an opportunities are here<person player="brandon pettigrew" race="nonwhite" position="TE">brandon pettigrew</person>the big fight in to make a play down in this red zone and it grew is the formation maintains his block option looks a kiss hood up and hit hard and there was <person player="jeremy beal" race="UNK" position="DL">beal</person> along with <person player="keenan clayton" race="UNK" position="DB">clayton</person> s they have to have the ability to stretch plays tonight against the sooners and get the ball to the outside we talked with him this week they mentioned they have such respect for<person player="gerald mccoy" race="UNK" position="DL">gerald mccoy</person>on the inside<person player="adrian taylor" race="UNK" position="DL">adrian taylor</person>and the marcus stranger they feel that there s an advantage from oklahoma in the interior they want to try to get things on the perimeter and it requires great blocking by the receivers to be able to do that that graphic told you i will officiate the sooners whore on third down lastly against the red raiders the play fake wide open on the outside again and davis seems to be the man who is getting free which would lead you to believe that brent and the sooners are paying a lot of attention to<person player="dez bryant" race="nonwhite" position="WR">dez bryant</person>and pedigree right now at number 85 is working three theyve done for the most part is kept the safety over the top of<person player="dez bryant" race="nonwhite" position="WR">dez bryant</person>oklahoma state telling us that he faces that almost every week what they have to do a good job is coming across the middle with crossing routes at about 15 to 20 yards to try to take advantage of that double coverage but so far youre right davis has been the answer<person player="adrian taylor" race="UNK" position="DL">adrian taylor</person>the big defensive tackle shaken up on the play and the medical staff is out tending to him of course i am sure that folks down in <person player="austin box" race="UNK" position="LB">austin</person> and lubbock way are are glued to this because if stoops and the sooners win we get a threeway tie and then the vcs computers and boys will decide at all now there s there s where they stand right now but oklahoma is very close to texas and a lot of people think if they win tonight making this late push but let s remember now the longhorns still hold the 45 35 is that airplane circled over me all day long here and reminded me of that as i was walking over to the stadium and head did go to the horns but they can no longer use just that i thought it was interesting last week good to see taylor up here ah yes here we are bought and paid for by some loyal longhorns then it cannot be overlooked folks although the one thing that im not comfortable with is having the bcs decide a conference title i think it should be decided within the conference i recall when the bcs was founded it was just to identify one versus two in that final game and i think they should use point differential within the big twelve south and a common opponent which happens to be kansas and then let the chips fall where they may that everybody knows where they stand i would use strictly what happens in the big 12 i dont think coaches in the acc big ten sec packet have any business deciding a conference title other than their own i just im not comfortable with there s too much politics involved danny <person player="dan bailey" race="white" position="K">bailey</person> on to attempt the field goal this will be a 28 yarder to put the cowboys on the board slide it through and it s 73 so to drive stalls heavily settle for a field goal saturday night football on atp whatd you buy southwest airlines low fares no hidden fees nissan when you heated most nissan delivers samsung mobile to predict the winning teams text rival 243 776 during rivalry week and taco <person player="tj bell" race="UNK" position="DB">bell</person> think outside the bun the gundy household midwest city oklahoma now kale gandhi who you see there s the running backs coach and he once was a quarterback at oklahoma mike of course the head coach of the of the oklahoma state cowboys was a great quarterback here at oklahoma say mom every mom would allow his daughter both these guys have found out no fun if you cant talk football thanksgiving what can you talk about there s nori toward the touchdown for the sooners and he shredded it funny enough lisa i know that you had a conversation with his mom that s right i spoke to judy gundy about an hour ago and she s the one who lays down the law saying no sports talk during thanksgiving dinner and he says my guys are just so competitive that you know i had to stop the problem before it started back when they were 15 and 17 they also got into a fight talking about sports and she said and i said no more sports off and family gatherings they talked about the invisible fence not working but this is<person player="chris brown" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris brown</person>down he replaced murray<person player="chris brown" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris brown</person>s course we punched out twice better that in norman and both those running backs but over a hundred yards so when you team up to marco <person player="demarco murray" race="nonwhite" position="RB">murray</person> with<person player="chris brown" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris brown</person>is good at hand at fine one of the best for the country can be fun to watch out tim beckham if he put the four meter and used to move guys in and out youve got to give oklahoma different look and <person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">bradford</person> looks over the sidelines of his assistant kevin <person player="wilson youman" race="UNK" position="TE">wilson</person> the offensive coordinator is looking right now better all those orange jerseys trying to get appeal for the best play ball youve got to continue to move around and that was moving later into a big hole this time and <person player="chris brown" race="nonwhite" position="RB">brown</person> washes the 30yard line i was a huge hole over by the left side is a big offensive line and sometimes when you move around and allows these guys decrease you but this time it was just a simple push down walk by the center number 50 cooper huge offensive line they move it a fast tempo runs in trouble and rip down for a loss that time and that was you go at kennesaw the sophomore from richardson texas in there make it play<person player="demarco murray" race="nonwhite" position="RB">demarco murray</person>hopes they get set back onto the field kennesaw made the play because he was able to get through and penetrate and low down <person player="chris brown" race="nonwhite" position="RB">brown</person> and now this is something that they take a lot of pride in same personnel but instead of being back with the back of the theyre now in an empty set it puts a lot of pressure on a defense when you have that kind of birth facilities the defense is looking and moving late the read that kevin s getting is changing as he changes things come with the blitz up high incomplete this is one of the better defensive jobs we have seen as we have looked at the oklahoma takes nexus christian had a great quarter against the but the cowboys are causing trouble when terrence <person player="terrance anderson" race="UNK" position="DB">anderson</person> jumps it s round good job of recognizing the route and fitting up stepping up and taking away the easy throw for<person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">sam bradford</person>get all the credit there is number 23 the junior <person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">bradford</person> oh for forward looking for his first completion three down linemen sublime holds plenty of time wide open for the first down<person player="manuel johnson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">manuel johnson</person>who made that sensational onehanded catch as the brace on the left elbow injured the arm against kansas missed most of that game in kansas state mr <person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">bradford</person> eyes he looks from the right to the middle and then finally comes back to the lamp in if youre going to run korean drop age youre going to get<person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">sam bradford</person>one of the most accurate quarterbacks in the country all that time did i set the defense he s eventually going to find an open man there are and it could have been picked off had the defensive back looked up at the ball more he would have had a crack at it the coaches saw that over on the sideline holding offense under 72 robertson first down and he was holding<person player="swanson miller" race="UNK" position="DL">swanson miller</person>number 90 who had broken through and he did not want him getting to the quarterback so we took a penalty on the play the one way you can attack the size of the sooners is with quickness and fresh bodies and beckham is rotating people constantly in and out of his line first in 20 they rushed a linebacker they throw the screen the other side and it is blown up patrick levine number 4 along with tail number 92 did the business on this play well this is just great recognition they feed it the entire way theyre sitting there waiting for it into it s finally developed pagon entire way sitting there waiting for <person player="chris brown" race="nonwhite" position="RB">brown</person> to come to him quickly they move complete their place is <person player="jacob lacey" race="nonwhite" position="DB">lacey</person> the defender there cackling so important i know it seems obvious flip but after watching texas tech try to set back oklahoma in the open field penny the big feet in a montgomery back in four thirteen nineteen tractors in trouble on the move and <person player="juaquin iglesias" race="nonwhite" position="WR">iglesias</person> working the sidelines it looks like it s a little short of the first down but sam was able to slip one right down the sideline there was pressure coming that time from <person player="orie lemon" race="UNK" position="LB">lemon</person> the middle linebacker watch number 41 get through there he comes fred second time in three theory the cowboys have done a good job of getting pressure on<person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">sam bradford</person>and theyve now forced the sooners to punt twice which could save something for an offense it s been pouring over 16 the last three games right yall is that to find the key price is now back deep he booms one but see what price whoops it goes to the end zone takes a beautiful bouncing out of bounds get the coffin corner as a great play when a punter can do it that was a 51yard beauty well here is 73 and a reminder monday night football monday at 8:30 pm mike tirico ron jaworski tony kornheiser theyll have one for you the jaguars and the texas jaguars have been really disappointed in their season but you can get the same <person player="maurice gray" race="UNK" position="DB">maurice</person> jonesdrew and maybe theyll have a good one for you on monday night we shall see about that folks look at this 99 yards away zach robinson keeps it the junior from littleton colorado he s good runner though herby and you know that s it s trying to get a breathing room against scoops as people hear that pathetic ability and his greatest strength in high school he played receiver up into his senior year he runs at 4 or 5 40 so and again tonight they want to be able to run the football there s a bigtime stat here favoring the sooners early in this game sets up ok handle that is what he does as well as any back weve seen in the big 12 he s tough after the first pitch folks ease it a little bit like thurman at first guy has a little bit of trouble bringing him down and look what he s running into too and yet he s still able to bounce off a couple tacklers and try to get some positive yards physical short compact ats low center of gravity 58 190 pounds he s out of tyler texas he had a quad injury which apparently was not serious a couple of weeks back and then there is then a third and four becca net read option okay look back over to see what coach mike gundy wants to be here run kindle again got close to the first down they do have a little breathing room for the potter here of irving they were able to get a little bit of a little bit of as you said your de jer to help the punter who s been outstanding this year matt fogg but still why you might see them be a little bit more aggressive at least try to get the ball to the outside and when you get conservative against oklahoma i dont like your chances to be able to pick up the first down and now the sooners very least to get very good field position here moisés madhu is the youngster who has practiced blocking punches on the left side broils awaits this punt at the 43 yard line for the sooners breaks free and there s a penalty flag so part of this run is going to come back apparently against the against the sooners joe clemente right block in the back there s a return i did with the way first down let s led you to new york and that whiner my friend oregon state s rose bowl dreams are fading very quickly tonight against organ this is <person player="jeremiah price" race="UNK" position="DL">jeremiah</person> johnson there he goes 83 yards he s up over 200 in the first half alone ducks have just returned an interception for a touchdown to make it 40 to send their oregon state loss in usd whenever ucla next week which says the trojans to fast data that should be a 37 pen score by the way organ up by a lot if im not mistaken that is huge for your ohio state buckeye it is your honor that could send them to a bcs bowl big for jim delaney here comes <person player="demarco murray" race="nonwhite" position="RB">murray</person> that could cost the pac10 a lot of money if that holds up and that s a big rivalry game the silver or never know you know if holy teams have had the advantage which makes it a little bit unusual but oregon state was not an overwhelming favorite this will not be a shocking upset now nice it had a lot of injuries at being at home he thought it might give an advantage to the duck playing pretty good football right now here is <person player="demarco murray" race="nonwhite" position="RB">murray</person> young man s nose even though the distance at anytime as christ comes up and makes us not lighting he is a young man out of las vegas so as the coaches is pervasive why did it carol and usc recruiting and they said they did but they want to make him a defensive back and we said hed be a running back and then they quickly added but let me tell you hed have been a great defensive guy his terrific speed for four and change he s fooled<person player="chris brown" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris brown</person>replaces him right now to get the <person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">bradford</person> nas in trouble cause of disruption and they have to throw it out of ours the oklahoma state defense being coordinated by tim beckman has disrupted<person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">sam bradford</person>s game here so far theyre doing a great job at disrupting things and getting pressure there s a good long look at coach beckham but when that play on 4th and 2 took so long to develop that the offensive line could not hold up long enough to give <person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">bradford</person> enough time to be able to eventually find an open receiver he had some open men downfield but they were taking too long to get open he s to punch that i heard he had been 51 and 52 yards they were coming right in on in that time twice is back and he makes the fair catch and about the 17 yard line well let s take a look down at the dr pepper big 12 update in oklahoma wins with a threeway tie for first okay texas tech in texas await them then the highest bcs rankings would advance i think in all fairness texas tech is out of that argument right now they fell so far back but oklahoma state wins this game now weve got a tie between texas and texas tech and guess what red raiders advance with that headtohead victory in texas i think a lot of people think that texas needs in oklahoma wrong can i that is not the case no they need and hopefully oklahoma win theyd settle for a seventh successor who okay and here who s handles on first now you have the rhythm of the game because one of the differences that were seeing here purvi

position="WR">broyles</person> was getting too excited they had oneonone matchups across the board on the outside mantoman coverage with <person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">bradford</person> recognizing it he had the time to throw just about the execution on the road for the sooners so instead of being inside the 10yard line theyre back on the 35 and<person

almost rolling defensive lines but right now bit of a guessing game going on with the communication up front from oklahoma allowing this group of payan company to get through this offensive line and disrupt the backfield and theyre moving 41 around he s their position like a middle linebacker youve been moving over to the right depending on the formation they run a screenplay into the middle and change go to the first down the risk when you bring pressure and youre going to show a lot of different looks is you might have four or five to go your way and all of a sudden youre going to see the jailbreak screen and all it takes is one completion for the sooners to be able to get big chunks of yardage and now theyve got a man in full third down and so number seven<person player="demarco

execution puts the deep end typically on its heels create tempo for the offense and a lot of times it puts a lot more pressure on the defense because they lose their aggression the cowboys are doing a great job of countering it up to this point so far the cowboys defense has been ready they have not been ambushed it it s second down ants <person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">bradford</person> checking for a late signal and now here s the movement of a defense movie now he puts four down there s <person player="jermaine gresham" race="nonwhite"

player="kendall hunter" race="UNK" position="RB">kendall hunter</person>is a great back but he cant carry the entire load alone if this game progresses the sooners are going to try to make adjustments to try to take him away robinson s ability to improvise his ability to run on the option and its ability to find<person player="dez bryant" race="nonwhite" position="WR">dez bryant</person>and<person

position="DL">english</person> look at both of the defensive end jeremy bo on one side and on the backside<person player="frank alexander" race="UNK" position="DL">frank alexander</person>they had a huge game last week against texas tech that s the first time weve really seen the freshman<person player="frank alexander" race="UNK" position="DL">frank alexander</person>burst into the backfield to

he was the preseason pick to be the defensive player of the year and he s been out with that knee injury coach thinks he s hopeful that he can get him back for the for the bowl game zach can run first down ahead and a penalty flag there s a penalty flag comes flying as frank s up to make the stop on it i think you can think of it maybe a push in the back by the the oklahoma wide receiver block in the back offense number 87 third down he s out like a receiver out in the open space and he s trying to help his his quarterback out here he comes right off to the left theyre just great call by the officials very close to the first down marker robinson trying to extend himself to pick up the first down but <person player="brandon pettigrew" race="nonwhite" position="TE">pettigrew</person> just pushing dominic <person player="dominique franks" race="UNK" position="DB">franks</person> right in the back and ally theyre starting over going back to third down that s the first penalty tonight on oklahoma state but there was a great look at the feet and the quickness of what that gravid thing can do when he has the chance from the open field <person player="kendall hunter" race="UNK" position="RB">hunter</person> back in he s a safety valve it s actual if he downfield in trouble again he shakes alex takes off again got a first down ahead and this time he picks it up what a

these last few plays back robinson starting to show what he can do with his feet success it s a little doug flutie appreciating that im sure back in new york watching zack robinson a little ole a little dance move an incredible acceleration upfield to pick up that first down mr peattie loves it 1st down and 10 battles failed by four kendyl broke away from jackson become a couple more i think you and i talked a lot about coming into last week s games it was the oklahoma defense going to be ready to deal with graham harrell i think they not only impressed us but everybody who watched some brent venables in the last few weeks and streamlined some things but i think these new faces now are settling down in the oklahoma defense theyre seeing more things theyre getting more game reps it s allowing them to play much much faster and with a lot more confidence it shows in a way theyre executing you see how tough it s been you can see how he have that torn right sleeve and that was big<person player="frank alexander" race="UNK" position="DL">frank alexander</person>got a pawnee man he ripped so were going to have a little equipment repair theyll cut that sleeve off well

telling you what<person player="keenan clayton" race="UNK" position="DB">keenan clayton</person>he could do just about anything as an athlete he s got the best vertical leap the fastest time and he could bench more than its linebackers now when they do that he is the physical specimen writer former safety great speed and i just talked about how important sacraments it is to this offense with his feet one thing he has to be aware of is when he starts to run get into the open field effect this oklahoma defense will bring needs six a diving interception incomplete but they stopped him on third down and that was <person player="keenan clayton" race="UNK" position="DB">clayton</person> again pretty close here athletic ability by the linebackers knocks his ball down and really never had a chance even if <person player="keenan clayton" race="UNK" position="DB">clayton</person> s not their ball is thrown low and hit des bracketed in their linebackers safeties and corners all keeping an eye on number one yeah when when when you go along doctor who can run that s something you know as well as as <person player="keenan clayton" race="UNK" position="DB">clayton</person> well this could make it a onepoint game 44 yard field goal attempt by<person player="dan bailey" race="white" position="K">dan bailey</person>likes it pretty good and weve got a onepoint game 14:15 czar coming up on the capital one a half time report big john all right in the blue team at have all the day s highlights including the two teams to advance at the acc championship big upset at the big 12 and oregon stayed in trouble against oregon and a flutie man it s going to be very happy nephew had a big play and fifi s going back tell ya acc tailgate virginia tech right yeah jinja tech bc but if you look at not just the whole day but what were watching here in this first half you know were talking before the game we could hit oklahoma state and keep it close every time bob stoops has come to stillwater it s a close game theyve been able to take advantage of some opportunities their defenses played very well when i was the last time we saw<person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">sam bradford</person>on his heels and being somewhat rattled now he s kept his composure he s led him to some big scoring drives but get the hook one with state defense a lot of credit for the way they played in this first half still time to go in texas tech red raiders fans and texas longhorn fans arent going anywhere glued to this one marae again theyre pounding well the skins

position="RB">demarco</person> had last week against texas tech for that matter the last two weeks he s averaged 10 yards of carry you can tell with two weeks of preparation the number one guy theyre trying to take out of this game is<person player="demarco murray" race="nonwhite" position="RB">demarco murray</person>second annie which of faith because youve looked at pen deflected incomplete that was pea <person player="tonga tea" race="UNK" position="DL">tonga</person> tail what a few like chilly weather when you come down alaska is calm and get it on he s a bit like him huh good balmy way

race="nonwhite" position="WR">iglesias</person> there is johnson nine yards and out of bounds it s good idea of the arm strength of<person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">sam bradford</person>for me i think he s got a chance to really go home at the next level i really do i am very very impressed with the how about being a sophomore in the way he manages with no huddle offense to not just the physical training there s <person player="demarco murray" race="nonwhite" position="RB">murray</person> crosses midfield before he s brought down by or 11 junior from houston he makes it look so easy that i think people take it for granted it s the first year that theyve implemented this hurry up offense and i think it s faster than any offense in america and yet theyre very few mistakes you very few turnovers there if you penalty it to a very incredible job of managing it but it s all because of<person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">sam bradford</person>s understanding little screen <person player="juaquin iglesias" race="nonwhite" position="WR">iglesias</person> let s back out to the outside didnt really fool the defense at his parish <person player="perrish cox" race="UNK" position="DB">cox</person> came up we have a cowboy cowboy shaken up on they get up play one of the defensive linemen is down and that s <person player="jeray chatham" race="UNK" position="DL">chatham</person> i believe he s a senior also from from houston both of these schools recruit down texas way there s so many outstanding football players down there so hurry im gonna im going to ask you about my point about the bcs deciding this tiebreaker if we have a threeway tie im just not comfortable with with using that system to do it yeah it is the fifth tiebreaker i mean they had to go awful long way to eventually get to the bcs standings but still it s so subjective right that s the frustrating thing is is you in texas and sitting here watching this hoping that oklahoma wins but went ugly oklahoma need to tackle tech to beat baylor it is it gets a little it gets a little crazy i like your point let s show you what it is yeah right now the point difference yeah i had two fellows down there the prints kept okay is where we are right now in a point differential bob stoops and oklahoma would have a lead and in mac in texas could not could not argue with black and white texas tech of course suffered because of that forty point blowout last week right if we head down there so that s where they stand so you know what texas texas argument kind of goes away they got the +10 against oklahoma but the rest of the same opponents now we didnt look at the entire schedule huggle just the game to the south and that one game all three played kansas that s what i did and ive got to ask the commissioner and bebe why they didnt go to some kind of system like that suck it down in six middle screen again coming back in royals he s got the first down plenty of time as you and i know for oklahoma with a minute to go in couple timeouts already in oklahoma state territory for me did you see the cannabis preservatives yeah i thoughts of snow to win the rain something might flow down tawdry singing cape daniel they just went back and forth the whole day missouri played their hearts out lost it at the end well see him next week same stadium big bull championship grab what a beautiful grab my crush him as he was going out of bounds on the far side talk about two great tight ends in his football giant football game grisham six six 261 pounds junior goes up into the air uses his big tall to just bring it in and not only that but he gets hit by sex as he makes the catch and picked up nine yards aimed at an event so look at the school records he has standing tall the glaciers could get a little low herbie is that what it looked like a little bit low but based on the way glacia plays and the way weve all seen him he s usually capable making that catch balls low for<person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">sam bradford</person>how dare he throw a ball it s down by the knees of a greasy crack but a glaze yes nine times out of ten he makes that pass i can stop the clock for the first down it is third and one theyve got two timeouts they got plenty of time here theyre going to throw for it hi and caught by crushing deflected and cut great concentration by number 18 on this ball right here second time weve seen athletic ability of <person player="jermaine gresham" race="nonwhite" position="TE">jermaine</person> grisham pretty good coverage actually like comps the corner who was lined up within the differences he s about 511 trying to match up with a tight end who stick thick but he was there but the focus the difference there by grisham drawing back to him powering toward the end zone looks like he s down about a sixinch line theyre going to market and the timeout is going to be used here by stoops it s a great look at the inside move by grisham huge opening there with the blitz coming from the linebacker<person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">sam bradford</person>is like a coach as a quarterback he reads the defense perfectly he knows exactly where he wants to go with a football once he saw the linebacker blitzing he knew where he had an opening and he knew we had a receiver getting into that opening and this time it s for sure he s had a huge crowd right here for the sooners big lift for the sooners <person player="josh cooper" race="UNK" position="WR">josh</person> heupel some quarterback here now coaches quarterbacks over there with with <person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">bradford</person> and his backup joy halls lee over there on the sideline <person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">bradford</person> followed highfill and jason white sure the instant replay boys are looking at it but he clearly was down short of the endzone well their big favorite to score here it s just pick your poison which one of these running backs do you want 12th play of the drive coming up for the sooners to run over the west i usually think they do here fumble on the snap crack furred has to go underground on it so he and marie and oklahoma state has it that is <person player="orie lemon" race="UNK" position="LB">lemon</person> who came up from that pile maastricht wanted to replay to take a look at this he should because it looked like <person player="orie lemon" race="UNK" position="LB">lemon</person> stole the ball away from<person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">sam bradford</person>paul is clearly on the ground <person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">bradford</person> never had a handle on it the ball is loose now <person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">bradford</person> looks like he had women come fitted he takes it away it looks did it look like<person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">sam bradford</person>had the football there im sure up in the booth now theyre running that replay back and forth and taking a look at it the poachers are waiting for us we take another look at it was he down looks like he has to football and <person player="orie lemon" race="UNK" position="LB">lemon</person> comes in over top to his credit like any defensive player is his taught take the ball away grab it away from him officials sometimes cant see if the ball secured he comes up with a football i must have been looking at it over and over it looks like he s down yes the sec <person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">bradford</person> head it looks like he s down and <person player="orie lemon" race="UNK" position="LB">lemon</person> made a smart play but im not sure it s for the stand and that would indicate it isnt going to stay in for sure so that would give the suitors huge break each break can get this football back looks like a timeout i believe is been called and now the oklahoma state side says what s going on here im glad theyre confused because when you thought that they would have thought they would want to take this snap the ball let s go fast as you can i would have thought that the referee would have turned the microphone with all like oh right usually yeah you go from the headsets to the mic and you make the announcement so in looking up there in let s check did stoops use a timeout over there i said oklahoma is without timeouts so that my thought is that they might have used a timeout to make sure that that play was looked at i think stoops had a pretty good look at what was going on and now oklahoma state s gonna challenge it the call is confirmed sooners offense out of the field a couple timeouts used all henroost oklahoma has the full football right now they have a second down and goal and the right end of the day the right call is sooner football the counter is course with their third time out sign out from the fast just not sure that it was cleanly handled to begin with no thought was but when he went down yeah i think it s good it s the right now and that s probably what support here suck it down and go marie repeat over to the right they lob end zone out of the end zone as doyle s incomplete and that was coverage by <person player="jacob lacey" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jacob</person> lacy number 17 going with it with the field judge was right on top of it <person player="ricky price" race="UNK" position="DB">ricky</person> fife has boiled mantoman and hon say a <person player="jacob lacey" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jacob</person> lacy does a great job of coming off of the receiver <person player="juaquin iglesias" race="nonwhite" position="WR">iglesias</person> and falling back on to <person player="ryan broyles" race="UNK" position="WR">broyles</person> going to the flag now third down and goal not make it here and that will cause scoops to make a decision<person player="demarco murray" race="nonwhite" position="RB">demarco murray</person>is split out he squatted to the right ruch five touchdown oklahoma gretchen and why not he s the man who brought them down the field he made the big plays on that drive<person player="jermaine gresham" race="nonwhite" position="TE">jermaine gresham</person>the junior from ardmore oklahoma <person player="tj bell" race="UNK" position="DB">bell</person> foot brent if anybody deserved a touchdown on that drive a german grisham to circus catches and then this one he s seen him doing so many times in this area where he gives a little outside moved just enough to slow down and head to take the linebacker hesitate and then he gets to the middle and that s a timing route weve seen them throw that a hundred times in practice <person player="jimmy stevens" race="UNK" position="K">stevens</person> texta the hold on grissom and <person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">bradford</person> have an ability to run this route as well as anybody imagine being a safety and trying to match up with grisham you see that little hesitation that s all he needs to get to safety to bite just a bit to the outside and look how easy it is but that is that is textbook from a tight end going up against<person player="andre sexton" race="UNK" position="DB">andre sexton</person>little outside move he bites on it and by the time he moves to the inside the ball is already in the air with the anticipation by his quarterback <person player="phil loadholt" race="UNK" position="OL">phil</person> a one possession game oklahoma state is down eight and that in itself is a story remember last week in norman at halftime it was 42 to 742 some pay basis it was over against the red raiders here 2113 fine fine young man outstanding golfer has great balances accurate isnt roar and he s moving up the charts as far as nfl scouts and raiders kicked along the ground now and picked up at the 8 yard line by this so bryant taken down with the five seconds left or in the first half well there s a lot of things going on on this on this big rivalry week and john and the gang will have all the details the acc championship is set missouri still doesnt know who they will play in the big flow championship great game in atlanta next week of course matching number one alabama against the team was absolutely on fire the florida gators under and the cowboys will take it on in down by eight so good job by mike gundy cowboys let s go down now to lisa with coach stoops thanks brent coach first describe from your vantage point what you saw in that photo a lot of confusion on the field we were unsure what was going on but weve recovered the football and it was down and then when we got up they picked it up and so we were pretty sure we had it all right now you know close game and you know for a nice long steady efficient drive to end the half what impressed you most about your offense on that last touchdown run well just the ploys to come back and put it in the end zone overcome a little adversity we need to run the football better hopefully in the second half we need to defensively we had some third downs when weve had some pressure and havent been able to finish the sack thanks for looking now great alicia thank you hey let s send it to the gang at times square studios think john is there with craig james the flutie man for the capitol one half powerful hate away john and stillwater he seems scored three times the difference in the first half oklahoma but they twice settling for field goals when they get inside the oklahoma 30 chris finally corso waiting for the second half well first of all oklahoma played very well defensively in there in the original but also remember oklahoma came back twice and answered when state got close to him the answer would cut down a lot of plants commercial drive at the end of the first half cowboys get the ball to start the second half what would you do offensively for them next 30 min oklahoma state long as you got zach robinson playing a quarterback you got a shot remember oklahoma was a seven point favorite it s ball game the experts ought to be tough it is tough well if style points are important for the pollsters who know what theyre thinking out there with texas and oklahoma crafts headed for a threeway tie the suitors have to do more in the second half oh absolutely they kind of get back and destroy them unless they come back and make it a real close ballgame then not enough scale style points i said this would have to do more work and a lot more laps megan f is coming up after this message and a word from our abc station how many times can free theyre always turn the car saturday night football on abc presented by southwest airlines with kirk herbstreit and lisa salters im brent musburger we welcome you back at eightpoint lead by the sooners 21 points ties their season low for the first half that 21 against cincinnati in texas at herby we may have may have a little story developing we noticed that you can see the quarterback here <person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">bradford</person> s taped that left hand talked about that<person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">sam bradford</person>has come out and starting the second half it looks like his left thumb is tate and well keep a close eye on that well talk to lisa to find out maybe the details but watching him in warmups coming out here he s taking some snaps and working with the center john cooper the one thing you have to be careful of is with an injured left thumb and getting that hand too injured even more so on a snap so yes all the impact going on the right hand and not at all on that left thumb in order to much leg off language no godly he was flexible yeah yep and as chris fowler told you oklahoma state get the first possession that we cannot emphasize how important this is of the cowboys down eight<person player="matthew moreland" race="UNK" position="K">matthew moreland</person>kicks it away and it is fielded on the 10yard line and will shore to the 20 is<person player="victor johnson" race="UNK" position="DB">victor johnson</person>and now herby time for southwest airlines play but the sooners came in on fire all offensively into this game three straight 60 point performances give the oklahoma state cowboys a lot of credit they mixed up their look made some plays allow themselves to stay in this game but eventually oklahoma settle down and back their last two drives they were able to go 79 yards than 80 yards both of them touchdown to end the first half to give them that eightpoint lead for receivers out and<person player="kendall hunter" race="UNK" position="RB">kendall hunter</person>the running back and he kept it beautiful fake by zach robinson that time jackson forced to make the tackle and many of the sooners defensive players jumped at <person player="kendall hunter" race="UNK" position="RB">hunter</person> as i do cant say it enough how important it is for zach robinson to be a factor especially if the cowboys want to pull it into this second half and make this a football game and take the lead his feet his decisions have to become huge second effort the ball came loose ball came loose sooners come out with it well let the officials sorted out repaying third down i say the remote no turnover on that play you know the defense is always going to react like that if <person player="kendall hunter" race="UNK" position="RB">hunter</person> is down once the ball comes out no of the home take it s real question that s a fumble and there s no question that it was and there s no great covered by nick <person player="nic harris" race="UNK" position="DB">harris</person> and brent i dont think they stopped they didnt have time there to stop stop the play no doubt about it that data care is regarded<person player="kendall hunter" race="UNK" position="RB">kendall hunter</person>take bring lovebirds like nick <person player="nic harris" race="UNK" position="DB">harris</person> paul weston not even close the umpire should be looking right at it sure and oklahoma state gets to the line real fast with the <person player="austin box" race="UNK" position="LB">box</person> is that one or film playaction fire down the middle and cross midfield and there is davis again they have two receivers to the bottom davis has had a lot of success getting this good time up the seam you saw nick <person player="nic harris" race="UNK" position="DB">harris</person> drifting to the outside because of who else<person player="dez bryant" race="nonwhite" position="WR">dez bryant</person>occupying his attention it opened up the middle there nice crease in the sooner defense and a wellthrown ball by zach robinson 23 yard gain and were checking a little mike gundy his staff over there and they have changed this window face other switches to the left trying to bring heat <person player="kendall hunter" race="UNK" position="RB">hunter</person> picks it up complete des drive to the crane yard line and with the opening drive of the second half cowboys get a break and now theyve got a first and goal after a 36 yard game very similar play this time youll see the safeties work to the outside it s going to open up again a nice tree here for the oklahoma state offense look at the safeties occupy theyre held to the middle in a wellthrown ball that s a ball there s a quarterback youve got to get back and throw the football with a lot of velocity a low ball to not allow the safeties to come over to make the play two straight throws here by jack robinson home to correct myself is back on the 11 yard line they could pick up a first down as <person player="kendall hunter" race="UNK" position="RB">hunter</person> takes a couple of defenders whitney<person player="gerald mccoy" race="UNK" position="DL">gerald mccoy</person>and on that table jeremy feel the left side if you look at the defenseman for oklahoma and there s his big <person player="gerald mccoy" race="UNK" position="DL">mccoy</person> field oklahoma state has struggled at times inside the 10yard line it has really settled for a lot of short field goals this year in this game theyve got to execute and come away with touchdowns once they get inside a 10 yard line zak going to take off short of the fiveyard line that s going to bring up a third down beale again what an advantage for the sooners to have the speed coming off the edge where you have<person player="jeremy beal" race="UNK" position="DL">jeremy beal</person>and<person player="frank alexander" race="UNK" position="DL">frank alexander</person>mccoy and taylor <person player="cory bennett" race="UNK" position="DL">bennett</person> ranger give you a good push up the middle and then if the quarterback happens to step up you can see the closing speed from<person player="frank alexander" race="UNK" position="DL">frank alexander</person>jeremy <person player="jeremy beal" race="UNK" position="DL">beal</person> coming from the outside in there s confusion with the offense now the defense of the late substitution we got third down now play action in trouble they brought the heat caught touchdown does <person player="brian jackson" race="UNK" position="DB">brian</person> then bryant has wanted to make a huge play in a big game so badly and how about zach robinson keeping the plant live two hands by<person player="dez bryant" race="nonwhite" position="WR">dez bryant</person>and <person player="brett bowers" race="UNK" position="DB">brett</person> i cant help but go back to the early part of this drive when<person player="kendall hunter" race="UNK" position="RB">kendall hunter</person>fumbled the football that nick <person player="nic harris" race="UNK" position="DB">harris</person> recovered that there was not enough time for the review to keep the drive alive and the cowboys capitalize on the opportunity third down and go for two zach and it s read perfectly by <person player="jeremy beal" race="UNK" position="DL">beal</person> picked up at the live ball now they can go for threw the other way they are not going to stop<person player="frank alexander" race="UNK" position="DL">frank alexander</person>he s going to rumble in for the deuce we saw that fan what he was looking for no fly bleh will be obviously under review when they can review this when it but they missed the last one this one looks like a funnel robinson who s made so many plays with his feet trying to make something happen beals in on him ball comes out and give credit to the foot to the oklahoma sooner defense for not giving up on the play and coming up with two points those defensive ends folks<person player="frank alexander" race="UNK" position="DL">frank alexander</person>and<person player="jeremy beal" race="UNK" position="DL">jeremy beal</person>they have really stepped it up since the second quarter the live ball afterburner video review the play is confirmed 20 so that makes it 23:19 now but let s go back earlier in the drive now watch the ball clearly comes out and watch number five right there he sees it got it for whatever reason it was ruled that and oklahoma state capitalizes fight this espn telecast available in high definition on abc hd in the thick of things and it has been better 23:19 im four point marching right down man with the golden shoes<person player="dan bailey" race="white" position="K">dan bailey</person>south whorfin mustang oklahoma and the goal line is marie the ace back looking for daylight stopped at the 25yard line i mean weve talked to quite a bit about this but<person player="kendall hunter" race="UNK" position="RB">kendall hunter</person>fumbling his football the suitors nick <person player="nic harris" race="UNK" position="DB">harris</person> recovering it he is called down gives the cowboys who hurried the line an extra chance and convert a few big passes they get down inside the 10 yard line and zach robinson athletic ability keeps this play alive<person player="dez bryant" race="nonwhite" position="WR">dez bryant</person>with a sensational catch first down and 10 <person player="demarco murray" race="nonwhite" position="RB">murray</person> is alongside <person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">bradford</person> with that tape left finger on the move throws incomplete he places the intended receiver furby the young the drive charts they tell a story now sure do you see the second drive they took advantage of an interception by <person player="dominique franks" race="UNK" position="DB">dominique</person> ranks short drive other than that you were forced to punt and then they settle down there lab two drives and a half they converted a number of third downs one drive their fourth before the other drive there was three for three big on third down and able to come away with 14 points marie except a couple of yards before he is thrown down that s the shocking thing to me brent so far tonight weve done beckham the deeper the coordinator from oklahoma state is a ratanak credit the whole defense says oklahoma s been running the football it will in the last five weeks good look there s tim beckham and so far they have 68 yards on the ground constant confusion moving people around theyve been at the whole game changing the front three down fires deflected complete look out in zone ahead progression the ricochet man puts up six more number 73 yards sometimes you got to be lucky<person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">sam bradford</person>actually puts this ball on the money right into the hands of manny johnston the ball goes right off of his hand and who s sitting there waiting then a young man who s had the biggest night for this sooner office <person player="jermaine gresham" race="nonwhite" position="TE">jermaine</person> grisham right place at the right time six points on the board for the suitors here s a little <person player="jimmy stevens" race="UNK" position="K">jimmy</person> stephens oh five six attacks going on all i can say folks luck be a lady tonight thirty i see saturday night football on

annuities and investments to specific life the power to help you succeed all the memories over there in heritage hall oklahoma state history and again our big 12 update here s the scenario now oklahoma wins it they would create a threeway tie for first and then the bcs ranking the highest ranking member texas had a slight lead coming into this game oklahoma state wins of course then texas tech would play missouri next saturday here s on the 10yard line let s go back to this touchdown rv ok<person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">sam bradford</person>would love to say that this is a play they work on on thursdays the balls pretty pretty swell thrown at the 3rd down plans passed and many johnson should have been able to catch goes right off of his hands almost like he pushed it forward to <person player="jermaine gresham" race="nonwhite" position="TE">jermaine</person> mitchum sitting on the backside youre wrong they were going to whisk all my fault bye felisha well brenna i was talking to mike gundy before the second house start and he said you know what our defenses played well theyre tied in and got a lot of hit balls where basically their sacrifice on the left obviously eventually hasnt started yet for four ball mistake exactly it hit the <person player="kendall hunter" race="UNK" position="RB">hunter</person> with the with the first girl yeah i want to remind everybody that <person player="jermaine gresham" race="nonwhite" position="TE">jermaine</person> grisham it s big six to 16 and the speed that he has on the outside where he s running away from people this time showing <person player="kendall hunter" race="UNK" position="RB">hunter</person> here on first down cowboys need to bounce back and again answer we always talk about that how important that is in college football because of the emotions how the cowboys involved back in their courts do what they can do exact is pulling out from an option look cant find an open man look the defenders and picks up a first down im talking tonight run very very athletic quarterback has improved so much with his passing over the last couple years but at the end of the day he s a dual threat guy that can make you pay for it if you dont have contain this is a very athletic defensive line from oklahoma and he s running circles around him right now he s picking up huge chunks of yards for the cowboys kept it here he comes another first down let s check in with matt in new york man hi brentwood center right now powered by vizio oregon built a 20point lead in corvallis an oregon state beavers have only been able to trade touchdown since we did now 13th at an oregon win would open up the door for usc to have the rose bowl by meeting ucla next week in the meantime trojans are absolutely mothering notre dame on espn the irish reported their first first out of the game on the last play the first quarter it s 31 3 e no there s not charlie so far boys i believe you sir yes sir first down and then zack fires open it then <person player="brian jackson" race="UNK" position="DB">brian</person> theyve got another first down the<person player="dez bryant" race="nonwhite" position="WR">dez bryant</person>is starting to make an impact if we take a look at the pacific life game summary and weve been keeping you up to date if we start at the evening we said these two running backs would be a factor in the game and i mean you look at the numbers pretty similar you have to say<person player="kendall hunter" race="UNK" position="RB">kendall hunter</person>right now has probably been a bit of a bit of a factor for the cowboys<person player="demarco murray" race="nonwhite" position="RB">demarco murray</person>started the game fast with a big touchdown but the cowboys have done a pretty good job of containing him and the sooners running game you know i go back to a decision that coach mike gundy made that im not sure was the right one when you wait for too early in this game as i look at that 30 team margin right now there s <person player="kendall hunter" race="UNK" position="RB">hunter</person> spinning down there they down by 11 points hurry and had they picked addicted theyd be sitting on 28 20 game still by 8 i dont knows what changed at that i was surprised in the third quarter midway through the third quarter mile scoring is going to be going on here to take an automatic opportunity to get that extra point away seen that a few times in some of the games today georgia tech was playing a little bit of that game with georgia theyre going for two early in that game with paul johnson ended up winning that game huge win for georgia tech my coordinating the offense a third and five numbers a krobinson on third down if he s not finding open receivers has been a nightmare for the suitors to try to contain picked up a lot of yards and a lot of first downs tonight by running <person player="brandon pettigrew" race="nonwhite" position="TE">pettigrew</person> has been quiet as a receiving active as a blocker three down linemen and his lead bought that time as <person player="kendall hunter" race="UNK" position="RB">hunter</person> came across the 30yard line at be trippin iman penda there were <person player="brandon pettigrew" race="nonwhite" position="TE">pettigrew</person> a very fine tight end and he was one of the lead blockers over there that time at time on third and five with a play call here with his own read the handoff to <person player="kendall hunter" race="UNK" position="RB">hunter</person> you gotta believe that mike gundy realized that he had two downs to pick up five and a half or six yards came pretty close to her on his first attempt but had every every idea in the world of going for this no matter what the results were there s our chart they use it at home and the road got a hurry now it s not at two seconds got it off broke to the 2010 endzone touchdown coming back 4:31 zach robinson goes 31 yards on the oklahoma defense great blocking here by the right tackle<person player="brady bond" race="UNK" position="OL">brady bond</person>steve dinning also a nice steel block in the speed and athletic ability once he gets into the open field and how about<person player="dez bryant" race="nonwhite" position="WR">dez bryant</person>give it a little effort downfield to make sure the quarterback was able to get to the endzone now coach gundy goes back kicking extra points so quarterback zach robinson and the cowboys are hanging tough in stillwater the sooners are far from being out of the wood in this monday night football on espn at 8:30 eastern the jacksonville jaguars and the division rival texans in that game have pretty good rookie down houston way steve slate came out of west virginia and i note that he s having a pretty good year as some of you fantasy players who took a shot at him were probably pretty happy you got him around to play panicle no i dont hear i dont understand i play real bull real no jogging buhbuhbuhbuh he goes the court gilded at the four by <person player="juaquin iglesias" race="nonwhite" position="WR">iglesias</person> that was the 26yard line and let s go back to her b s tip drill the understeer wednesday folks that was against texas soils there this was earlier with the diamond and inviolate the kuda six point the last time the head of all by the way limited speed hit six 260 pounds just walking away from the underside safeties in corners most home who fakes the not only the fifth row but serious speed in the open field by grisham sooners last three possession have been touchdown oklahoma for show blitz we run <person player="chris brown" race="nonwhite" position="RB">brown</person> away from it ganged up on about a yard or so careful out there a bit of swinging there oklahoma state on defense defensive lineman gets frustrated from being held theyre not getting any help from the officials start to take matters into their own hands it s a competitive game you dont want to lose your cool next to the linebacker he s freaking up <person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">bradford</person> rosen underneath to <person player="chris brown" race="nonwhite" position="RB">brown</person> and this makes it third and very short i think because oklahoma state is doing a good job at the line of scrimmage and taking away the running game<person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">sam bradford</person>which he s done these last few possessions is going to have to get most of the yardage through the air to solve some things up a bit then you can get back to running the ball toss play with <person player="chris brown" race="nonwhite" position="RB">brown</person> struggling bus for the first down that was a fine run by<person player="chris brown" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris brown</person>the junior from louisiana i mean they are fighting scratching clawing for everything that they can get when they try to run a football you get nine guys up at the line of scrimmage on third and short and <person player="orie lemon" race="UNK" position="LB">lemon</person> is there to hit <person player="chris brown" race="nonwhite" position="RB">brown</person> short to the first down but the toughness there the power by<person player="chris brown" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris brown</person>gives the first down<person player="derek burton" race="UNK" position="DL">derek burton</person>is is down shaken up and being tended to well we welcome in a friend of ours who s certainly watching the game very closely down in <person player="austin box" race="UNK" position="LB">austin</person> coach mack <person player="chris brown" race="nonwhite" position="RB">brown</person> of the texas longhorns and mack first let me ask you what are you seeing here tonight what do you see with the oklahoma sooners my friend well were seeing two great teams brent and kirk up i mean we played them both and beat both of them and knew they were good football team and oklahoma state stuff at home and im not surprised by anything ive seen tonight mack what is what is your feeling on the threeway tie breaker in the system and getting down to the bcs standings i guess is the fifth tiebreaker when you have three teams that are tired of it you think this is the best answer well kirk number one that it s three really good football teams with texas oklahoma and texas tech and somebody s going to be really disappointed tomorrow there s there will be two teams that probably deserve to play in a championship that wont get there but it seems to me like after looking at the sec rule for a tiebreaker in the acc rule for a tiebreaker it s pretty simple with home state wins tech is in headtohead with us since peck is not in the mix if oklahoma win so this to highlyrated scene we should be in hit the head if oklahoma wins tonight regardless before click when the share of background the on the first and ten <person player="demarco murray" race="nonwhite" position="RB">murray</person> the oklahoma running back now <person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">bradford</person> checked over to see what kevin <person player="wilson youman" race="UNK" position="TE">wilson</person> wants done sent down below three down linemen they had been using four down and moving <person player="andre sexton" race="UNK" position="DB">sexton</person> in and now they come back with the linebacker standing up rush for <person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">bradford</person> in trouble runs out of it and close to a close to a first down enough mac let us say that oklahoma does wind up with a couple more style points and certainly they were closing in and theyre playing here tonight let s just surmise for a minute texas is still very much in the chase for the bcs championship game down in miami though arent i correct about that i mean oklahoma would have to go play missouri and kansas city and then well see what happens with alabama and florida what are your feelings about that well there s no doubt i do think i do think the big 12 will revisit this room rent next spring because head to head if we talk about playoffs all the time when you play head to head and it doesnt count it s really hard to act like playoffs would make a difference our kids that played great they are in the mix you guys saw the texas oklahoma game it was a classic but it was on neutral film we won the game so i think that s where i would be coming from obama is a great team and i think it s hard to try to explain to our kids next week from missouri and oklahoma playing when we beat hope out how frustrating is it to sit back and have this be subjective whether it s the bps or it s the big 12 south with a threeway tie breaker as you said you guys dont have to apologize for anything the season that youve enjoyed this year but to sit back and not have any control over this has to be very difficult i think the only thing that can come out of this good kirk because again therell be two good teams not go is that hopefully everybody will revisit this system and and not have kids not be able to get someplace when theyve accomplished what they needed to on the field bakugan thank you very much with us tonight and good luck regardless of what happened you and the longhorns have had a wonderful season and weve enjoyed covering some of the games ill tell you that the big 12 south ladies and gentlemen has been just a wonderful wonderful conference and you know we watched a couple game from the north for be the the nebraska come back with a 57yard field goal against colorado and then the missouri kansas game a conference that has had a great great year from the playaction down high snapped out by broyles<person player="ryan broyles" race="UNK"

position="DB">sexton</person> there too you have a balanced attack and the defense is trying to take away one thing which is clearly tonight the cowboys trying to take away the sooners ability to run the football you got to put the ball into the hands of<person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">sam bradford</person>with passing kaman that s what theyve been able to be here he s last four or five drive where s <person player="chris brown" race="nonwhite" position="RB">brown</person> short of the end zone to the to be third down and goal coming up <person player="jeray

position="RB">brown</person> and its fourth and goal up three mobsters usually known as a guy who s confident he likes to take chances weve always seen that from him as a head coach it looks like this will be no different you saw <person player="demarco murray" race="nonwhite" position="RB">murray</person> shot back onto the field was there a reason or is he a decoy he s flurried not open touchdown and that is<person player="brody eldridge" race="UNK" position="TE">brody eldridge</person>the other tight end and the first time that <person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">bradford</person> has looked at him all day he comes uncovered wide open how about the poise the<person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">sam bradford</person>on the road cant hear yourself think bedlam a game that s going back and forth youre thinking it s either <person player="demarco murray" race="nonwhite" position="RB">murray</person> or is krisha and instead it s off to the right to back up tied in<person player="brody eldridge" race="UNK" position="TE">brody eldridge</person>the defense does not account for him at all it s almost like they looked at him as an offensive tackle they even think about him as the possibility of going out for a pass he was taxed on the point that is five straight touchdowns now for <person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">bradford</person> the sooners and their last two possessions they have scored touchdowns on fourth down another saturday night in the big 12<person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">sam bradford</person>the biggest difference from last year this year like the emotions look at the leadership now did you see from sam radford it comes naturally through experience he s now providing that for the sooner all offense into the team and <person player="matthew moreland" race="UNK" position="K">moreland</person> kicks it away from the pen here s <person player="perrish cox" race="UNK" position="DB">cox</person> little opens cops break the tackle now in a footrace to the end zone they will not go away 90 yards of pure bedlam kickoff return coverage had hurt the sooners all year one of the most important times of the season bob stoops coverage teams not coming up with an answer how many of the voters have now decided that the long ones are starting to look better and better well this is still this game is still in doubt and look at what happens here just what a sooners want to take back to momentum a nice crease there originally but then the effort there there are two maybe three suitors there corralling theyve got him careful the nice theyve got him careful the nice return for maybe 30 yards but it s not going to go the distance good job up front they create the grief look at this two or three guys it s 50 busy trying to take the ball away instead of securing the tackle and once tough kept in balance brent you talked about b wow now it s more eastern and bullock exhausting as sherry creek up in the saddle for physics the water speaking of exhausted he s got it all the way down kind of effort with that 41 points he s got you know it down a lot of work candidates in hate a seven and a half minutes to go now boys walk back away here he comes from inside the endzone <person player="demarco murray" race="nonwhite" position="RB">murray</person> stumbling and he makes it out to the 36yard live for the goal line wow herbie alright as we look at the pacific life game summary talk about the two quarterbacks here tonight well it s been a lot of fun to watch these guys put it in their own way<person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">sam bradford</person>look at the page he s making by the way for the heisman trophy 25 and 38 over 300 yards great decision three touchdowns no interceptions and actually 15 yards rushing the back robinson has been sensational the bottom over there 108 yards rushing his feet have kept the cowboys offense alive and in this game we have not had a put in this game since the first quarter coming rusher begin the tightening hard for one man to bring him down that was <person player="andre sexton" race="UNK" position="DB">sexton</person> the linebacker over there mentioned how the sooners coverage team is hard to connect last time we had him in dallas in the top bullet murder they get shipley from texas the fourth kick off the day of loud to go all the way back for a touchdown something you would not expect from such an athletic group and the oklahoma sooners like an 1/8 lovick is alive and cheering for the cowboys and oklahoma laws would send texas tech to the big 12 championship game next week <person player="chris brown" race="nonwhite" position="RB">brown</person> slashing through short of the first down for the first time in a long time weve seen oklahoma s offensive line have a chance to get to the second level by that i mean better than the guards trying to get up to the linebackers to give their backs enough room to run sooners only 116 yards tonight running the football so theyve had to do it through the air for most of the night off the silent count picks up the first down <person player="juaquin iglesias" race="nonwhite" position="WR">iglesias</person> and i know that s only going to go into the stats is just another conversion another nice path by <person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">bradford</person> but because of where we are in this game with nine minutes to go because it s going back and forth the awareness deploys the decisionmaking the crowd is trying to take him out of the game who keeps his cool and continues to make great decisions taught and that s crush him again they go with playaction just to freeze the linebackers for a bit and by doing that gives of a nice window see the timing and a rhythm comes off the play action he takes about two hitches distributes the ball right over the top of <person player="orie lemon" race="UNK" position="LB">lemon</person> the middle linebacker into the hands of british of who s having a huge 958 yards progression here tonight and a pair of touchdowns that clunker screen <person player="ryan broyles" race="UNK" position="WR">broyles</person> has a first down at the 14 yard line price the tension bag anytime you leave <person player="ryan broyles" race="UNK" position="WR">broyles</person> alone over the slot like this<person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">sam bradford</person>s going to call off the play that he originally wanted just get it out there right now <person player="ryan broyles" race="UNK" position="WR">broyles</person> pick up a block on the outside and just like that there s ten yards of the first down maria s bottled up thrown for a loss was at the end of this wild one was like the chevrolet player the game from each diamond chevrolet will make a $1,000 contribution to each university general scholarship fund that s got a few candidates tonight <person player="brett bowers" race="UNK" position="DB">brett</person> mmhmm itll be hard to picture big one shot maria s slipped out there the left side enzo wide open touchdown <person player="juaquin iglesias" race="nonwhite" position="WR">iglesias</person> pick your poison with this much 17 yards miscommunication in the back end from the oklahoma state defensive backs looked like to me<person player="jacob lacey" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jacob lacey</person>the corner had some confusion with the coverage hed stayed up instead of dropping back and retreating and who other than<person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">sam bradford</person>to say oh youre going to make a mistake and give me an easy touchdown thank you very much six straight oklahoma touchdowns can anyone stop this machine 92 points scored here tonight a 10point lead for the sooners 717 remaining now at the cowboys 2 school record for this 82nd career touchdown pass on the ground is mine and im out in the 2009 superfans load that here s <person player="juaquin iglesias" race="nonwhite" position="WR">iglesias</person> on the touchdown he s going to get to the outside now you see oklahoma state theyre going to drop theyre going to drop this man right here lacy should drop but watch what he does instead see the confusion he comes up bites actually on <person player="ryan broyles" race="UNK" position="WR">broyles</person> and look at grisham look at he glazes go right behind him easy read easy touchdown for oklahoma and you can see lacy on the back end of that play after he glacia spools away from him pretty easy touchdown easiest pitch and catch that theyve had all night lacy looking back at his defenders saying i mixed up there on the coverage what coverage was that lisa what s the situation with the young linebacker over there <person player="austin box" race="UNK" position="LB">box</person> for the sooners over and<person player="austin box" race="UNK" position="LB">austin box</person>unfortunately out for the rest of this game they believe that he has an mcl tear in his left knee and theyre telling him that he could be out up to six weeks what a shame theyve already lost <person player="ryan reynolds" race="UNK" position="LB">reynolds</person> he left the texas game of how the longhorns went to work on that and mike mulligan number 10 now comes over and he will take a crack at it theyve used dick <person player="nic harris" race="UNK" position="DB">harris</person> in one game they moved him to middle linebacker and so theyve tried a little bit of everything in <person player="austin box" race="UNK" position="LB">box</person> was was coming along it was improving and i believe that <person player="jeremy broadway" race="UNK" position="WR">broadway</person> was shaken up on the up on the kickoff credit think about this curtis lofton left his defense early to go to the nfl so theyve really had to move <person player="ryan reynolds" race="UNK" position="LB">reynolds</person> to the inside theyve had a lot of lot of injuries there that theyve had to deal with one bit of business for the trojans before they take on penn state because that is ucla first sack of the night canaan <person player="keenan clayton" race="UNK" position="DB">clayton</person> rolls in the junior from sulphur springs texas they converted safety that s one way to take away the mobility of back robinson is just coming on and before he s even able to see you but you talked a lot tonight about<person player="keenan clayton" race="UNK" position="DB">keenan clayton</person>at his speed he and<person player="travis lewis" race="UNK" position="LB">travis lewis</person>both having four or five speed from the outside linebacker position that time catching robinson off door second 19 for the cowboys underneath well short and that was bull again mike mulligan who had moved to middle linebacker up with a big hit welcome to the game mike pfohl again couple series under his belt he settled down great look at him reading the defense he feeds that <person player="kendall hunter" race="UNK" position="RB">hunter</person> s leaking out of the backfield as the check down for zach robinson he s there in the open field big hit by poll against third and 16 a lot of time bye hi and complete almost intercepted damien davis was the intended target on that play robinson had his receiver actually breaks free here nice job upfront time to make this throw davis has made some good catches tonight ball is high who s got to be able to secure that catch and pick up a first down if he holds on to that football it s a first down on third and long oklahoma can tighten the grip here <person player="ryan broyles" race="UNK" position="WR">broyles</person> standing back on the sooners 45 yard line they figure to have great field position and over there on the side was <person player="dominique franks" race="UNK" position="DB">franks</person> and that will be a short feel for them when the reminder that via the skin smiles are 3:30 eastern on that abc kj choi it took me money late today and <person player="phil loadholt" race="UNK" position="OL">phil</person> mickelson stephen ames rocco mediate will be competing for 3:30 you know the sooners have not been able to run the football as much as they would like to youve got to think theyve got to mix it up here and try to work the clock as much as they can here is <person player="demarco murray" race="nonwhite" position="RB">murray</person> he goes out of bounds oh hit hard over there the wall there s not much space between the sideline and that wall <person player="demarco murray" race="nonwhite" position="RB">murray</person> went over to the bleacher seat and uh you could see there s just not much room there tight quarters here hit right as he s going out of bounds and his momentum boy boy fortunate to be able to get up from that from the sidelines and <person player="brian jackson" race="UNK" position="DB">brian</person> will come in second down a one after the 9yard first by <person player="demarco murray" race="nonwhite" position="RB">murray</person> <person player="demarco murray" race="nonwhite" position="RB">murray</person> s rushed for 64 yards milking the clock here they get the first down and then some and <person player="chris brown" race="nonwhite" position="RB">brown</person> first <person player="chris brown" race="nonwhite" position="RB">brown</person> tough to bring down let s show you how effective this sooner offense has been here the last six times they have scored a more important look at the distances that they have traveled anytime youre able to have six straight scoring drives with touchdowns obviously that is good but what ive been impressed with is their ability to answer the attacking style from oklahoma state and the sooners came in their last five games theyve been running the football 273 yards a game on the ground oklahoma state s taking that away and bob stoops kevin <person player="wilson youman" race="UNK" position="TE">wilson</person> the offensive coordinator theyve had to adjust and clearly they did right see four and a half two straight touchdowns and they havent looked back since <person player="chris brown" race="nonwhite" position="RB">brown</person> again what has <person player="chris brown" race="nonwhite" position="RB">brown</person> done for you lately right now oklahoma killing the will of oklahoma state late in this game this is where you start to see the running game all of a sudden starts to work theyve been leaning on it theyve had the up tempo now that theyre up by 10 getting close to four minutes to go in this game on the state running out of gas a bit upfront <person player="chris brown" race="nonwhite" position="RB">brown</person> stopped at the ten <person player="jeray chatham" race="UNK" position="DL">chatham</person> and again our scenario oklahoma winds wed have a threeway tie for first in the south texas and texas tech and the highest bcs ranking would advance at the moment texas holds that but it was a very slightly very slight lead over oklahoma and remember it was the computers that had texas rated quite highly and we have a player shaken up and that s <person player="jeray chatham" race="UNK" position="DL">chatham</person> s down 3:44 chat him off on his own power coming to the sidelines oh three down linemen of course at <person player="sam bradford" race="nonwhite" position="QB">bradford</person> mill hurry here take as much time off as the farmers with cannon lavigne making the stop timeout oklahoma state with two timeouts so reminder again tomorrow night on abc desperate housewives and that s at 9:00 8:00 central on abc so we have the big show for come on i was networking here weve got oklahoma head by 10 points and a key question as to what s going on right now is whether or not theyve got enough style points to overhaul texas in the bcs rankings it s simply coming down to that if they could maintain this lead obviously everything if it can happen everybody s going to be watching this game they watch the thursday night game for me personally what oklahoma s done is impressed this is last couple weeks but but i always go back to the head to head i looked at what texas and oklahoma did on the same field we called it in dallas texas beat them and for me that s enough for other people of course if youre an oklahoma fan what about hey sector speck beat texas and look what we did the texas tech i understand that that the mayor comes down to texas or oklahoma for me personally they got me the minority based on the way the polls came out last week third down incomplete thrown into traffic that time<person player="tj bell" race="UNK" position="DB">tj bell</person>was the defensive back there and stoops up ten i believe is going to be confident to go for thirteen here he s going to be comfortable nine yards and was a fourth and nine coming up and here s young<person player="jimmy stevens" race="UNK" position="K">jimmy stevens</person>he doesnt get the try to move here because the pendulum when he suffered the yarder beforehand whitson is the whole whack did pretty good so it was a 5441 lead and of course whoever whoever comes out of the big flows out they will play missouri next saturday night the dr pepper big 12 championship in kansas city and im certainly hoping that the weather might be just a little bit better than what i was watching today with the missouri and kansas like a little bit of everything in the city so the wild card in his scenario is if missouri somehow not solved whoever ends up showing up and next week s game but it s oklahoma or it s texas if they end up going off an upset the team that s left out of getting the kansas city so could theoretically make it to the national time indeed boise state i can hear that pr machine start to roll everybody remembers what happens the last time they went to a bcs bowl im sure that the sooners remember the statue of liberty play of one of the most exciting bowl games ever in the fiesta bowl where s usc has to take care of ucla next week morland short man retreated on the 23 yard line and down to the 34yard on with 250 and down 13 hurry they cannot waste any time now zach robinson is going to have to work some magic here they need to get down the field in a hurry make some plays find some scenes in the oklahoma secondary which theyve been able to do quite a bit in this game but you got to find damion davis 85 and of course<person player="dez bryant" race="nonwhite" position="WR">dez bryant</person>and<person player="brandon pettigrew" race="nonwhite" position="TE">brandon pettigrew</person>getting out of bounds getting first downs anything they can do to help slow down this clock bryant goes off to the right zach chose it <person player="kendall hunter" race="UNK" position="RB">kendall</person> came out as the safety valve and <person player="kendall hunter" race="UNK" position="RB">hunter</person> picks up a first down and stopped the clock get in college football the clock will not stop completely until you get under two minutes now the clock the game clock will start with the play clock once the referee gets the ball set up the clock will start zach robinson needs to be aware of that because every second at this point matters 12 seconds fumble loose ball oklahoma has recovered adrienne taylor and jeremy biel the oklahoma defensive line usually takes take control of football games and the last five week that can we have seen em tonight theyve been held off to a certain extent because of zach robinson s mobility but this time<person player="jeremy beal" race="UNK" position="DL">jeremy beal</person>just has the speed and the power to go right around<person player="brady bond" race="UNK" position="OL">brady bond</person>and kiss his back robinson off guard knocks the ball away in the sooners get that is big taylor down on the bottom with the recovery two takeaways lead the ncaa in that category the sooners are closing in on a w they want another touchdown you know that right here s marie staying in bounds keeping the clock moving you said it in the open style points their players shaking up down there down that s <person player="perrish cox" race="UNK" position="DB">cox</person> returned a kickoff for a touchdown well you know it s been such a busy busy weekend we told you about this great great game between kansas and missouri congratulations to the jayhawks our that on that gut check up there in that weather coach mangino and florida crushing florida state in the rain in tallahassee one of those teams on an incredible roll right now and theyll play alabama for the sec title bama shutting out auburn ending six years of iron bull frustrations and of course oregon going into corvallis tonight and texas tech escaping baylor just so many so many great stories unfolding 2:03 left here and then theyll turn it over to coaches who vote and the usa today coaches bold and to the <person player="nic harris" race="UNK" position="DB">harris</person> poll whoever that s made up of and the computers will roll then theyll shake it all up and then theyll pour it out and theyll tell us who s going to play this very next week bringing the clock down lastminute now marie couldnt quite get the first down quick more making the stop okay with the cowboys two weeks to get ready for tonight s game played very very hard probably about as well as they can play on the defensive side takes a lot to slow down the sooners as well as they played theyve held a moment at 54 points for me i think there s a lot about oklahoma i think it is very smart at this point for stoops shut it down and run the clock and shut it down fine hell that theyre thinking about might help them with you know there are some coaches over tonight poll that say i dont think you want to that if they score a touchdown on the ground like <person player="chris brown" race="nonwhite" position="RB">brown</person> running here you know that s fine because it s up for the cowboys to to stop them but you know you dont want to go rubbing somebody s facing it when youre trying to to make a statement i mean they put 54 points up on that board on that scoreboard they lead by 13 they were favored by seven i believe something like that only it was it was a short number because oklahoma state plays very well here in stillwater and i think the feeling on the oklahoma sideline is that if they won the game on the road that they would get enough juice by playing oklahoma state in the computers that they would be able to jump up theyll take the chances with the photos voters head him ahead over yeah that was the thing last week what they did the texas tech at home impress the coaches press the <person player="nic harris" race="UNK" position="DB">harris</person> poll that s why i felt if they won this game that regardless what texas did if they just went out and played well and won the football game that had based on the trend that we saw last week you would think that oklahoma would emerge and be in the big 12 championship just based on the fact that they jumped up in both polls last week it is clear he shut it down liyan so fall johnson was over there getting ready celebrate that 11:11 you can try it opens middle touchdown anyway 28 yards and that drive without using the pass as a major weapon they did run it in nets for great games with over 60 points for the oklahoma football people i dont care who they play and where they play out theyre fixed to the four points missouri better give her home if yaself oklahoma theyre going to be two points no matter who s there all right aint neither begins texas too hacksaw of the extra point weve had over a hundred points scored here tonight and the big boys on front just wearing down oklahoma state i thought it s a different it s a different feel late in the game after team has played with so much emotion so inspired eventually you hit that wall in oklahoma right there to capitalize to take advantage of that found the crease and<person player="chris brown" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris brown</person>gets upfield in a hurry pretty good see do for stranding ill be jacked right down with the lobster jacket for the defensive backs terrific recruited to close always hug the senate when youre a coach or guy you get a big hug for some company you take care of yourself boomer sooner yeah a trip back to normal what s
