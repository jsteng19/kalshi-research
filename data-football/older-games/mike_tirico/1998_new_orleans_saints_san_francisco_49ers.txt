player="earl little" race="nonwhite" position="DB">little</person> bit and put pressure on him that s all you can do i mean it s not a hard equation it s just hard to execute all right thanks coach and mike the things are going to also have to try to generate a running game they only managed to score two rushing touchdowns and theyre 10 games this season all right solomon thanks very much there is steve mariucci only in his second season in san francisco already talked to the contract extension for the former california head coach and new orleans will get the football first as <person player="wade richey" race="white" position="K">wade</person> ritchie is set to kick <person player="aaron craver" race="nonwhite" position="RB">aaron craver</person> the center deep man who has only returned three kick this year he averaged 40 in yards per return including the country braver at the seven silver boys <person player="david richie" race="UNK" position="DT">david</person> dilling his feet across the 25 to the 26 mike did get going deep into the playbook early <person player="earl little" race="nonwhite" position="DB">earl little</person> check on the reverse here s the saints offense with <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">kerry collins</person> making his second start he adds a new dimension to the passing game with his strong arm their running game has been almost nonexistent in the passing game working tight end can cleveland the leading receiver an experienced offensive line has had its problem but they can always count on william rope one of the finest tackles in the nfl put and thin out of the island play innocent in the bar drop at the 30yard line right in the hands of john <person player="sean dawkins" race="UNK" position="WR">dawkins</person> and he couldnt hold it what a fro by columns what happens is the saints decide they want to go after <person player="rw mcquarters" race="UNK" position="DB">rw mcquarters</person> the number one pick of the 49ers it s just a flat go you back up <person player="sean dawkins" race="UNK" position="WR">dawkins</person> gets on his outside court outside shoulder the ball is absolutely perfectly thrown and just goes right through his hands it s amazing lots of play they just ran we talked to san francisco defensive guys yesterday every single guys to amass deserving to throw deep they do it on the first play play for new orleans would have been standing field because it is not a touchdown now is to throw on second down airs it out again contact a flag that will be interference so two passes both incomplete but it looked like <person player="zack bronson" race="UNK" position="DB">zack bronson</person> going to be called for interference on this one you just cant impede the offensive guy to the ball and <person player="zack bronson" race="UNK" position="DB">bronson</person> number 31 watch what he does on <person player="sean dawkins" race="UNK" position="WR">dawkins</person> he comes into the picture right here when he puts his arm in it reaches in that ball is catchable i also thought <person player="sean dawkins" race="UNK" position="WR">sean dawkins</person> does a really nice job of trying to make a play on this ball which really helps the official make the right call the gain of 46 to the san francisco 29 yard line <person player="lamar smith" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lamar smith</person> is the single setback the homer pack up in seattle tell him to throw it in throws on the run in this incomplete pluck out of the pocket by chris dolman for san francisco on defense the line has been sensational getting after the passer young and bryant the best tackle combo in the game an athletic group of linebackers <person player="winfred tubbs" race="UNK" position="LB">tubbs</person> the former saint the new man <person player="ken norton" race="nonwhite" position="LB">norton</person> has gone over a hundred tackles for the fourth straight year the secondary has been torched <person player="darnell walker" race="nonwhite" position="DB">walker</person> s been the steadiest corner with hope nursing a bad back the rookie mccord gets his second straight start coleman against rose he had for the first time the simnet rope probably not responsible for any of them here comes the blitz <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">collins</person> unload he went one way the receiver went the other that was nearly picked by ken <person player="tim mcdonald" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mcdonald</person> that is what you see what happens when you bring a quarterback in into the middle of the season gary <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">collins</person> is still trying to learn this offense <person player="danny wuerffel" race="white" position="QB">danny</person> abramowicz the offensive coordinator has had to work with a multitude of different quarterbacks and it s so hard to get everybody on the same page especially when youre working on blitz pick up <person player="danny wuerffel" race="white" position="QB">danny</person> better slow down where you wont have any fingernails left it s early we wont have any fingers ago the three wide roofing do third and ten talentless my man shaun <person player="andre hastings" race="nonwhite" position="WR">hastings</person> was open to 20 <person player="merton hanks" race="nonwhite" position="DB">merton hanks</person> on the coverage but columns too strong with that path well they said they had to throw the ball downfield it looks like theyre totally ignoring the running game to start with i think it s a good way to start you have to get some kind of confidence in this often if im the offensive coordinator daniel ramage i have to feel good about the fact that ive had people open the last pass was just overthrown but the calls are there so now we have something to work with that bryan comes on to the field goal a careerbest 13 out of 15 this is from 47 he s got the plenty of legs belong this year 56 and lift one is drilled through with 20 despair and the new orleans saints taking opening kickoff and help by a 46 yard penalty get a real goal you dont build community cars or get you to warp a pinstriped car we dont build cars superior

position="LB">brian</person> who connected on a 47yard field goal to open the scoring in this ballgame teams it up at the 30 and he will kick to the speedster scheffel v s so new orleans accomplished what they wanted a bass start in the previous three games against their francisco they towards devon they already had three tonight leaving from the two and shut down this is 17 yard lines here s the 49ers offense for <person player="steve young" race="white" position="QB">steve young</person> more remarkable numbers 23 touchdown passes only 7 picks and a chance to win his seventh nfl passing title purse is closing in on another thousand yards season and right end of the weekend in the nfl and edges with number two and yardage it s an often injured and often criticized line kevin golden acquired last year to make them anticipate is a twotime pro bowl first adverse carry across the 21 tripped up by chris port don oh for the saints defense <person player="wayne martin" race="UNK" position="DT">martin</person> maybe the most underrated tackle in the game <person player="laroi glover" race="UNK" position="DT">glover</person> and johnson very good pass rushers and linebacker <person player="kevin mitchell" race="UNK" position="LB">kevin mitchell</person> is hurt so the rookie chris board on ou starts in the middle <person player="mark fields" race="UNK" position="LB">fields</person> the former number one pick has a chance to be a star on the outside the secondary has given up yardage but the starters have 14 interceptions night tied for second in the nfl was fired are you for the first row to pick up i cant comb again for up to here as soon as you saw <person player="steve young" race="white" position="QB">steve young</person> double clutch you knew something bad had to happen when you have set patterns like this all things is and if you double clutch it s going to wind up someplace fast and they always talk about the rhythm of stanford s this goes off i think that heels back in the pot i watch he starts to go he stops now the ball just slides over <person player="greg clark" race="UNK" position="TE">clark</person> s head lines of writing code again the same good restrictive it better still call lemond strip on the clock trying to get outside picked up about a yard he s only averaging three and a half yards a carry this year and of the four put backs for new orleans that s by far the best average well if you want to know in why they did running that first series of downs this is one of the reasons why he really they really get even with mike ditka came in which said mike what about your wannabe a pause for a second did we have to do something about it they are 29 through the nfl averaging only 82 yards a game on the ground defense has carried them this far that 39 and their foot back from client and i have on the year <person player="brian jones" race="UNK" position="LB">brian</person> young goes right around christie olli the secondyear player out of colorado what he does is it s a rip move watching what hell do is hell get on and they bring that right arm up he gets him in a bad position and turns the corner and winds up right in <person player="terry kirby" race="nonwhite" position="RB">terry</person> <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">collins</person> left <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">collins</person> never had a chance this guy is relentless a lot of people believe he s the best defensive tackle in football personally they believe that here in san francisco so nice john randall plays an jet truck the third and fourth team for the law another fact with a vanilla field only now is that to step up apply establishments incomplete intended for people will check the marker prior to the snap false start number 74 offense fiveyard penalty third down it s the right tackle <person player="clarence jones" race="nonwhite" position="OT">clarence jones</person> the eightyear veteran out of maryland well the only good thing about a first of all is it didnt complete the pass that number it s the best part about this you get in another play even though jones is that plays everything existed because it was before the play happens the only negative part of the doe call was the fact that youve been moved back five more yards now but you make the field goal attempt if you dont convert something here it is a <person player="earl little" race="nonwhite" position="DB">little</person> bit more difficult let s see if theyre conservative and try to get part of it back or all of it on further law tasting iii just go right on hi not many <person player="earl little" race="nonwhite" position="DB">little</person> 36 a 35yard return the ball came loose they are saying it was caused by the ground and the new orleans saints off it up the kickin man is back now when he told us yesterday he said this is been out of it he s been worried about what all the other guys were doing he s im bringing the chicken man back gary college just flat makes an overthrow here down the field receiver cant get to it now <person player="merton hanks" race="nonwhite" position="DB">hanks</person> does a real nice job of picking up blockers as he works youll see carry just as he lets it go gets hit the ball sails on them and chicken man lines up with it here s the chicken is back look out here he comes look a <person player="earl little" race="nonwhite" position="DB">little</person> rusty to go rusty chicken but it seems exchange turnovers young has to go over the middle this time to hurt takes the tempo and brought down as please get to the safe territory at the 44 for donnell and <person player="mark fields" race="UNK" position="LB">fields</person> on the stop this is what every single person on defense with the orlan says and the first thing that mike ditka said to us when he walked in the door number eight if we can control number eight a <person player="earl little" race="nonwhite" position="DB">little</person> bit then we have a chance but when you see <person player="steve young" race="white" position="QB">steve young</person> at his best he looked all over the field and then decided to go to <person player="garrison hearst" race="nonwhite" position="RB">hearst</person> well he knows his ballclub blue good opportunity when they got the interception other than hand attack without even the benefit of a field goal crock and yes got out of them from work field tennis shot adam caught up better of it as he got to the sidelines having a chance to talk to saving eulerian the defensive coordinator and visit with them last night and earlier before the ballgame what he basically said was his biggest concern is <person player="steve young" race="white" position="QB">steve young</person> being flushed out to his left he said we want to make him go to the right if he s going to run that time you saw the amount of yards he picked up doing what <person player="steve young" race="white" position="QB">steve young</person> does best going to his left they have it at the 33 yard line serene up in new orleans ten and a half minutes to go open occur from san francisco first night whole <person player="garrison hearst" race="nonwhite" position="RB">garrison</person> hurt one with his head down to the 25yard line ill tell you brown goggan and dolman cristal in the center those three guys up in the middle watch <person player="ray brown" race="nonwhite" position="OG">ray brown</person> number 65 he s going to pull up and go up into the hole he gets the block right into hole that s outstanding a card game he makes us take today the names on this one first in the backfield kota was in there in our hurry that will be a loss of a yard well that s just that s an example of having more people up on the line of scrimmage and you can block and that s a safety go to making the play so often when you get safeties committed to try and stop the run around the line of scrimmage you have to look for plays outside with your receivers and they certainly have three good ones in <person player="jj stokes" race="nonwhite" position="WR">stokes</person> <person player="terrell owens" race="nonwhite" position="WR">owens</person> and of course the great gary wright well the only reason he ducked there is because they went with two tight ends otherwise he s got to be back in coverage <person player="mark harris" race="UNK" position="WR">harris</person> s name as an extra wide receivers off guard with four on third and three young short stuff first down inside the 20 brought down by <person player="fred weary" race="UNK" position="DB">fred weary</person> the rookie out of the university of florida this is if there s a staple of this offense it s the quick slant you see him he s the outside white receiver you get the defensive back just to turn a <person player="earl little" race="nonwhite" position="DB">little</person> bit and then you break it down on the 45 inside colors the reasons they have is watch dese number 6300 johnson now johnson slips down but the one thing that these does this boat right back up with it and stay with them another first down for san francisco first not much there <person player="garrison hearst" race="nonwhite" position="RB">garrison hearst</person> came into the weekend hit in the conference in rushing with eight hundred and forty nine yards he s got a heck of a job for them but i think the most impressive part that mike is not the amount but in gavage 46 yard to carry if san francisco can get over forty half yards of carry out of a running back it s going to put <person player="steve young" race="white" position="QB">steve young</person> in a much better position to make play till last year they had not have a foul you are back safe with you water then hell get the life throws on her sand versus melted by feel there s a flag down in the secondary this field is always slippery <person player="joe johnson" race="UNK" position="DE">joe johnson</person> number 94 is in on <person player="steve young" race="white" position="QB">steve young</person> and how he gets away just shows you the strength of <person player="steve young" race="white" position="QB">steve young</person> tom white is our referee and apparently it s against san francisco pass interference number 83 out thanks 10yard penalty second down <person player="jj stokes" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jj stokes</person> called for the push off remember the defensive player has the right to establish a position there he is up he starts out yet he throws the right arm out fred where he just got pushed out of the way and <person player="jj stokes" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jj</person> he s sort of shocked and i dont understand why yeah <person player="jj stokes" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jj</person> had a tonight acting job who me he was anybody i mean the guy had pushed out of the picture techadon 18 earth systems in an aesthetic play in younger the screen the hosts beautifully defense as new orleans got laroy <person player="laroi glover" race="UNK" position="DT">glover</person> out there from a tackle spot he got hurst ankle <person player="joe johnson" race="UNK" position="DE">joe johnson</person> number 94 is having a problem at footing in here look at this he s blocked but not that badly and he goes right down these gets him on the ground youre right leroy <person player="laroi glover" race="UNK" position="DT">glover</person> what a play he makes on the screen he not only fights off but he gets back out and makes the tackle that thing had a chance for some good yardage third and 12 now harry <person player="terry kirby" race="nonwhite" position="RB">kirby</person> comes in on third and long and they let him out young guests up for the

<person player="john farquhar" race="UNK" position="TE">farquhar</person> puts one on the ground now cleveland after he makes the catch cant quite put it away the 49ers are going to swarm theyre going to try and create opportunities he s got to put away but it just slide down good tackle ball gets loose big break for new orleans or just huge i mean you look at this ball getting kicked around and there are three san francisco 49ers there and no one can get the ball so it s second and two for the wall celaya game and now i think youre going to reset the play clock that was down to double zero well it seemed like it was awfully quick i think they resented to ruin play please reset the play clock 25 seconds ill say you know youre in a hospital environment when the people boo the play clock nah mean thanks bill position tremendous tonight or in advantage the 49ers that they havent used the cordillera vantage yet palance again with time throw go to the middle point gather the three yard

<person player="zack bronson" race="UNK" position="DB">bronson</person> was coming on the blitz you got to figure this if youre the san francisco 49ers you know new orleans cant run the football so you let your seven people up front do what they have to do and you bring people off the corners because you got to figure the only way theyre going to get the end zone is groaning white 31 joe <person player="zack bronson" race="UNK" position="DB">bronson</person> coming off the corner and theyre not enough people at the tackle can i say some sure these throws that ball just a <person player="earl

ball thrown pass interference on defense first down within five yards you allowed to make contact reporters well there s the end of it you can just see the quarters is going for the ball very difficult to tell exactly what happened because we couldnt catch it off the line who grabbed the whole of your shirt first in goal formal warm barry boyd a client young exploded let s check the marker and their offsides first and goal from the half yard line yeah there may have been one guy outside but ill tell you what the penetration in the middle of that field by the rest of them was incredible with all that penetration do you think about a quarterback sneak outside the left offensive guard after distance to the goal first down number 97 <person player="brian jones" race="UNK" position="LB">brian</person> young now he s offside but look at the penetration of the rest of their all in the backfield bambam i got to believe that the saints try and run it again theyre going to wind up bruising boyard a playaction pass right now and i can possess alternative and some white is going to whistle this one did and reset the play clock again well knowing mike ditka the kind of tough guy he s always been reset the game clock the 51 seconds please you would have to think his mentality right now is if we cant run it four times to get a happy yard we dont deserve it i dont mike i dont necessarily believe that the questions are realist he doesnt have a running back that has the ability to pound it in hell take seven no matter how davis is 16 dulce quarterback keeper no signal is yeti cured look like he broke the plane and he did behind the left eye the line wrote and purl i always say if youre half backs cant get you into your course but you figure that weighs more than everybody in the back that s right do 40 and he s real close carry cause this time they do get a good push you see the center in the two guards now that s the view that the official had west number 77 william roll he s a big part of that push carey <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">collins</person> just jumps on his back and ride them into the end zone <person player="doug brien" race="UNK" position="K">doug</person> bryan comes on for the boy after 34 seconds to go in the first quarter and the new orleans saints are stunning the san francisco 49ers and nothing ive

he was going to be the quarterback of the panthers after that meeting with dom capers the only way i think he s going to gain any respect back in this game is to go out and play he s gonna have to prove to his new orleans saints teammates that he s capable of getting the job done as a leader and so far tonight he son everything he s had to delete his football team to the lead san francisco just

they have to feel and get into a rhythm so far the saints have been able to take them out of that by jumping the routes by not allowing <person player="steve young" race="white" position="QB">steve young</person> to get the ball out in his normal rhythm and timing and it is really destructive roughness his accuracy if you let him sit back there he would literally kick to the part as he has for years first five yards to the sink 45 you know one of the things talking to <person player="steve young" race="white" position="QB">steve young</person> yesterday was our friday with some consistency

race="nonwhite" position="RB">kirby</person> he grilled as he got to the twenty one mark field he s going to be a star in this league major battle it s a point to be made wasnt you just dont ever give

<person player="jerry rice" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jerry rice</person> is going to do look at <person player="tyrone legette" race="UNK" position="DB">tyrone</person> he s going to take the inside away if you want the outside youve got it inside youre not coming in here <person player="jerry rice" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jerry rice</person> coming off of those two knee surgeries last year and he doesnt have that clip just back in his tux yet by his own admission i dont expect gary weis to feel a look like we know your <person player="terry kirby" race="nonwhite" position="RB">terry</person> nights to bat until 1999 second and goal empty backfield young oh become the goto guy for senior what he lines up with is your official officer looking for micmac youre looking for the people in the second area to try and cover your target and what you wind up with is <person player="terrell owens" race="nonwhite" position="WR">terrell owens</person> a big strong tough receiver against corners inside the point after is good and after trailing 10 nothing the 49ers have come back to take a 14 handling over the face and some words on the sideline for new orleans <person player="terrell owens" race="nonwhite" position="WR">terrell owens</person> winds up from the inside drake was not real thrilled <person player="alex molden" race="nonwhite" position="DB">alex molden</person> is the guy that gets torched fifth time number 25 he swears up always just goes down inside and youre not going to stop him he s big and he s strong <person player="steve young" race="white" position="QB">steve young</person> gets this thing out in a heartbeat before you know it he s in the end zone and that is the 49er offense we have been used to being for so long well i think great for what ru is upset about is youre got youve got help weve got help on the outside dont let him get inside i go back to what you said well i thought you made a great point by giving for the 49ers around two minutes left to go in the half field position at the 43 instead of making them go further makes it real tough on your football team drake furred unhappy on the sidelines he may have been able to tell his teammates what was coming on that play to his team is enough as paul said in practice what we saw the time before how much of an inside position he took on <person player="jerry rice" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jerry rice</person> when they tried to throw the post to him 106 to go in the half new orleans has all its timeouts left you can bet drake furred with extra incentives in this game with thee five yards please well keep it there were talking about break was not being very happy with the touchdown but i want to go back a play before when he s covering <person player="jerry rice" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jerry rice</person> you see him on the outside look at how far inside position he takes he knows that s what <person player="jerry rice" race="nonwhite" position="WR">rice</person> wants to do so he jumps the route and knocks the ball away now <person player="alex molden" race="nonwhite" position="DB">alex</person> bouldin hits peter more square they just freeze them at the line and you see <person player="terrell owens" race="nonwhite" position="WR">owens</person> just run away from them then draper s trying to explain to him you just cant do that there we go make them throw to and make them throw them outside not inside things take over at their own corner flavor on the draw across the 39th tuck 35 38 yard line <person player="tim mcdonald" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tim mcdonald</person> s a strong safety made the tackle longest run of the year for <person player="aaron craver" race="nonwhite" position="RB">craver</person> take a timeout you have three of them want to running a long running play like this youre going to lose about 12 to 15 seconds getting everybody set clock running 42 left in their column the wings if complete pull makes the catch in san francisco territory and how they will use this time now you got to take your time i think i think this is fine but i think the first play there was 50 some seconds to go as long as youve got three timeouts youre in a pretty good situation now youre up around midfield you can take some shots 34 seconds to go two timeouts left you get about five plays out of this espn s college football begins next saturday at 11 am eastern with college gameday the show records in at noon interest big rivals virginia and virginia tech over on

hawkins first down the orleans own stopped the clock again after a gain of 31 all the pass protection on this play is absolutely magnificent william rollon dolman watch 77 on 56 you think dolan has a chance to even get near him look at the hands on william roll gary <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">collins</person> has enough time to look down the field <person player="rw mcquarters" race="UNK" position="DB">rw mcquarters</person> really just gives <person player="sean dawkins" race="UNK" position="WR">dawkins</person> and casual bump the biggest problem for the 49ers defensively this year has been their past coverage and there s a huge hole here for <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">kerry collins</person> to make the throw and of course <person player="sean dawkins" race="UNK" position="WR">dawkins</person> just tucks it away a <person player="earl little" race="nonwhite" position="DB">little</person> bit this time better as he moves down to the 18 you know one being talking to william roll yesterday about <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">kerry collins</person> and what do you thought about him being there he says be a big wake that this guy wasnt playing football he said the other thing is once a week he thinks <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">kerry collins</person> together and sit down to talk to him to see if there s anything carrie picked up the pan it comes to blink and marks play by <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">collins</person> who throws it into the stand i think you have to go after it s obvious then the 49ers cannot generate any kind of a pass rush just rushing forth which is amazing because that front for <person player="roy barker" race="nonwhite" position="DE">barker</person> has 11 sacks <person player="bryant young" race="nonwhite" position="DT">bryant young</person> sevenandahalf <person player="junior bryant" race="UNK" position="DE">junior bryant</person> with four dolman has 11 and a half but i think you also have to take into consideration this saints front you may not they may not be household words with those five guys up front other than wolfe whom everybody s aware are doing an excellent job of protecting collars they have been sensational tonight if you make the second development another blip times unload complete inside the pen pick a 5foot therefore again it s gone gone clock is running and the saints wasted about four seconds before they got a timeout with eight on the clock that was all <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">kerry collins</person> powering his arm he is packing out theyve got the blitz right in his face he and the receiver on this exact

him get down side and hangs on to the ball well that s the kind of pattern theyve slipped on six or seven times in the first half all the green on that last play ryan you only had a clean shot at <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">collins</person> and <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">collins</person> you talk about headset play directly like
