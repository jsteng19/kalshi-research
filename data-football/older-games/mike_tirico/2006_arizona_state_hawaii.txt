well most of the nation on the east coast and other parts of the country david were sleeping hawaii was putting up gaudy numbers for most of the season but the one thing you cant sleep on is their quarterback<person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">colt brennan</person>may be the most prolific quarterback in college football this year well statistically i think it was the best year a quarterback has ever had in the history of division one a football you look at<person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">colt brennan</person>today he has a chance to break three of the most coveted singleseason records at the quarterback position and it s hard to believe you look back a year ago<person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">colt brennan</person>played an entire season as a walkon led the country and total offense his specialty accuracy and intangibles it s going to be exciting day get a comfortable chair because were going to see him throw it all over the law led the nation this year in six different offensive categories<person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">colt brennan</person>to think that not many teams actually recruited him or got in on him as for arizona state on the other side of the field today the sun devils coming in at 7 and 5 one of the great turnaround stories in the nation this year at least on the defensive side of the ball with a lot to prove today now when you talk about arizona state david last year their quarterback<person player="rudy carpenter" race="UNK" position="QB">rudy carpenter</person>like brennen this year led the nation in passing efficiency he wasnt able to duplicate that feat but he is still the key to what they do on the field well at times this year he s been a quarterback under siege and really a decimated group of wide receivers he lost some key receivers to graduation a year ago injuries on the offensive line but<person player="rudy carpenter" race="UNK" position="QB">rudy carpenter</person>is very capable you dont lead the country in passing efficiency like he did a year ago without being able to get the ball downfield hawaii plays an aggressive style of defense i think<person player="rudy carpenter" race="UNK" position="QB">rudy carpenter</person>is going to have plenty of big play opportunities down the field in the pass game and one thing for certain you would bet that <person player="rudy carpenter" race="UNK" position="QB">carpenter</person> is ready to take a bunch of hits today from that fierce hitting warrior defense ten and three against seven and five well be back with the opening kickoff in just a moment when it comes to choosing a career consider the laborers and union contractors when you think of the laborers think construction health

legs right now some thousands of miles away deep into the pacific honolulu hawaii they call it wahoo the gathering place had their that s how they say it in hawaiian down to you and date mark and today could be a historic day for<person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">colt brennan</person>the junior quarterback has a chance to rate three different ncaa marks <person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">colt</person> has 53 touchdown passes on the season that s one shy at the singleseason marks at 16 years ago by houston s david flinger what makes that even more impressive he has a hundred and twenty six fewer attempts thank ling ler did <person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">brennan</person> also has a chance to set the passing efficiency and completion percentage marks this year as well so that s an awful lot to digest but let s put it into perspective this way<person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">colt brennan</person>has more yards and more touchdowns than ohio state s troy smith and michigan s chandni combined expanding serve numbers this year on the heels of another pretty good quarterback here timmy chang as we look at the temperature of pretty much right on par for the season 81 degrees but the thing that were really interested in how high are those waves david nori up on the north shore sunset beach to get on that banzai pipeline and ride that bad boy 12 to 18 feet that s kind of treacherous if you asked me the water temperature a warm and balmy 77 degrees well from the stick to the longboard on waikiki june jones the head coach in his eighth season has taken to this team to five bull games arizona state winning the toss elected to receive michaei hey back deep along with <person player="justin tryon" race="nonwhite" position="DB">justin</person> trying for dirt cutter screw in a sixth season this is his final game he has been terminated as the head coach at arizona state venice carson this game certainly some ambivalent feelings for a jerk cutter and his entire coaching staff as well as a lot of the players coming into this game to see how they perform today for the coach of his final game at the helm deep in the end zone it s <person player="justin tryon" race="nonwhite" position="DB">justin</person> trying to it s deep taking it out and trying still on his feet and brought down finally at the 43 yard line a nice kickoff return against the warriors who traditionally have done pretty well in special teams so good starting field position for arizona state let s take a look at arizona state s lineup aloha im<person player="kyle caldwell" race="UNK" position="DL">kyle caldwell</person>senior defensive end for arizona state university im here to introduce the offense it s one of a kind i know best cuz ive got to practice against them for the last four years in a row i starts up front with tight end<person player="zach miller" race="white" position="TE">zach miller</person>consensus allamerican doesnt get much better than this he s a nightmare for everybody defense it goes against im sure itll be another great day for him also up front is senator mike pollack and all pac10 guy guys i was going to get the best of you before you get the best of him wine can have to be on its p s and q s collectively today they gave up 33 shots during the course of the regular season sean de witte in the ball game interesting move he gets the first carry of the game it s not an expected part of their starting lineup but he gets a nice gain out to the 40yard line defenses making the tackle and let s take a look at the defense for hawaii know hi everybody davon best number seven the university of wife football wide receiver im here to introduce you guys to our difference the players i hope these guys have been upon a shoe as bad as they do me every day in practice first were gonna start off with my two twin tower killer assassins defense the ends million for cell and the calculi more instance then we gonna move to the backfield my man hitting man mr dinner <person player="leonard peters" race="UNK" position="DB">peters</person> himself aka the next troy polamalu high praise for his teammate this is terrain who s in the game by a lemon a nice gain for brian terrain who was second team all pac10 this year ran for a 50,000 in 69 yards into that quick look at<person player="leonard peters" race="UNK" position="DB">leonard peters</person>a hard hitter a real transition for arizona state off a year ago a year ago the number two offense in the country they averaged over 370 yards passing the football per game and with the injuries the welldocumented injuries to the wide receiver group this has become more of a running to mike jones split wide to the bottom of your screen they run it theyll have the first down at the 45 yard line that was terrain dry average 52 yards per pop this year has six touchdown rushes on the season not bad for a kid coming in from butler of community college usually david takes a little longer for those jc kids to assimilate on the two losses and they were devastating losses for arizona state in the opener in the second game of the pac10 schedule against cal and oregon terrain really hit the map went through over 190 yards against cal went over a hundred against oregon and that was really the emergence of the ground game for the santa run it again and about three yards look at the improvement defensively for hawaii and this is the lack of a better term of a hardhitting bounty hunting type defensin doc the bounty hunter does to live in hawaii remember jerry glanville is a defensive coordinator remember back in the 80s the house of pain down in houston that two years ago hawaii was a hundred and seventeen dead last in defense now theyre in the top half of the country defensively in the grand give it to dmitri nang to get nice cutback at the line of scrimmage and answers god at the 40<person player="gerard lewis" race="UNK" position="DB">gerard lewis</person>theyre gonna be about fine if you are short of the first down so already weve seen three different tailbacks carry the ball for arizona state david we see nan s de witte on the first play of the game in the terrain and<person player="keegan herring" race="UNK" position="RB">keegan herring</person>also expected to get a lot of touches in the backfield today interesting metamorphosis from dirt cutters uh mo his signature usually more of a passing attack the way theyve had to reshuffle this offensive line the substitutes have been better run blockers and i think that s been part of the transition burden five were gonna pass here it s completed the 33 to mike jones mike jones appears to have the first down at the 34 lewis again making the stop we talked about it at the top you dont lead the country in passing efficiency like<person player="rudy carpenter" race="UNK" position="QB">rudy carpenter</person>did a year ago without throwing the ball with great accuracy and timing and that time he shaded jones to the outside read the position of the defensive back lewis on his shoulder put the ball right on the numbers shonda witty in a tailback handed off to the lydian goodsized and peeta s comes up from the safety position to put the hit on at the 26yard line<person player="leonard peters" race="UNK" position="DB">leonard peters</person>and<person player="jacob patek" race="UNK" position="DB">jacob patek</person>a couple of hardhitter said the safety sponsors look at <person player="leonard peters" race="UNK" position="DB">peters</person> number 42 or the tri captain s well coaches from the mainland understand that when he come in line up against hawaii a big part for the defensive scheme for hawaii is intimidation and jerry glanville made no secret about it during the week we like to go for the knockout shots were gonna bring it and were gonna be the hardest hitting team on the west coast to reign in the ballgame and he gets the carry and he stopped up right at the line of scrimmage maybe lost to guard back to the 26 yard line this is the opening drive of the ballgame for arizona state at seven and five and coming off of a win against their rival arizona and their last outing three and a half weeks ago sun devils lost the hundred <person player="andrew carnahan" race="UNK" position="OL">carnahan</person> stephen bird two big keys upfront on the offensive line but to be fair to what theyve had some substitutes that have stepped up brandon rod mike paulette <person player="julius orieukwu" race="UNK" position="OL">julius</person> or you cool all gaining all pac10 on dances the tailback a little waggle action and it s incomplete no flags on the play intended for<person player="zach miller" race="white" position="TE">zach miller</person>and now there s a late flag thrown<person player="jacob patek" race="UNK" position="DB">jacob patek</person>put the hit on miller miller is arizona state s allamerican and to sort this flag out this is a midamerican conference officiating fruit <person player="jacob patek" race="UNK" position="DB">patek</person> was aggressive and he arrived before the ball arrived he really didnt need to make the hit on<person player="zach miller" race="white" position="TE">zach miller</person>because this ball was not going to be completed the big part of arizona state s passing game is the bootleg we all remember jake the snake plumber on the bootleg back in 1996 a team that came 60 seconds from the national title and not a very well thrown ball if pop tech doesnt arrive early arizona state s looking at a fourth down situation instead it s going to be a first down for the sun devils were going to place the nose of the ball at the 25 yard line and here s the call they give it to arizona state first down the <person player="rudy carpenter" race="UNK" position="QB">carpenter</person> a six to sophomore 270 pounds 17 to 25 against arizona in their last game build on that confidence little shift upfront by hawaii this is <person player="dimitri nance" race="UNK" position="RB">nance</person> on the rod and <person player="dimitri nance" race="UNK" position="RB">nance</person> s drag down right around the 20 yard line lemon mini you know jerry glanville nors used to wear black right david wasnt his name says that he s never had safeties further than seven yards from the line of scrimmage likes to get them in law they believe two tickets braille to savannah back when he was the head coach abuse that he died and i said that did you always leave two tickets for elvis he said we just we just did it one game he didnt show up so he didnt leave tickets again second down in five on a trial a nice hole over that left side loose ball still nice and hawaii says they have it hawaii football coming back the other way from the 10yard line i renew very number 38 where the warriors recovered the loose ball well arizona state on this opening drive running the ball effectively just a great job by hawaii both attacking the football and with the strip and it looked like<person player="myron newberry" race="UNK" position="DB">myron newberry</person>came up with the recovery as you said mark but a great job by the rainbow warriors rallying to the football i think sippy havent seen<person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">colt brennan</person>this is a great opportunity especially for those here on the east coast first down in 10th coming back the other way to the most prolific quarterback in college football this year statistically anyway man in suit go suck the pass defense let s meet the hawaii office hello everybody im mckellen francis starting defensive end for the university of hawaii im here to introduce the starting lineup who whoops me every day in practice and i get frustrated by hanging with it we got my main man<person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">colt brennan</person>the gunslinger who s slinging it to number seven devon best sure hands never drops a pass well front we got the big boys samson <person player="braston satele" race="UNK" position="LB">satele</person> a who s the center of destruction and tolly sera oh man you better watch out i was on state cause he s coming after you you have a guy named samson and hercules david on your offensive line youre in business second down in six brennen trying to pull the trigger again a little bit high and incomplete intended once again for best as we made the sun devil defense now i was it my name is brandon rawe defensive tackle from arizona state i grew up right here in hawaii im here to introduce the defense i know these guys the best inside go against him every single day first we got<person player="dexter davis" race="UNK" position="DL">dexter davis</person>defense event freshman allamerican in the backfield we got the safety tandem of<person player="josh barrett" race="nonwhite" position="DB">josh barrett</person>the fastest man on the planet and zach the cat kennedy s<person player="josh barrett" race="nonwhite" position="DB">josh barrett</person>is a stud at that safety spot third down and six coming up why trying to move the ball after the turnover off the fumble by terrain complete the best for the first down at the 30 yard line this second team all whacked this year working against<person player="josh barrett" race="nonwhite" position="DB">josh barrett</person>and interesting matchups david with those different receivers well and it s really tough especially the slot receivers for hawaii devon vest has had a terrific year 180 catches for best over the last two years but they put so much pressure on you as a secondary and and mark when you talk about all the numbers that<person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">colt brennan</person>has posted this year a lot of people think hey he played a cupcake schedule this team lined up against alabama the boys who stayed a team is going to be in a bcs game oregon state purdue on his plate some tough defenses to compile these numbers land fires complete this managed to bryce mullins another first down beyond the 41 yard line <person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">brennan</person> by the way has just gone over 5,000 yards passing for the season 5,000 yards is $5000 i dont care what do they do talking about is there s a look at the man that he s chasing tape of klinger formerly of houston writer said back in 1990 chose the ball just beyond the 40yard line this is the first offensive sequence for the warriors wow was the loan back this is a favorite play of theirs and a second faster than allah he is a bowling ball and lethal in the open field you gotta wrap him up and he gave a little christmas present to the d beyond that he tried to tackle them good block and<person player="jason rivers" race="UNK" position="WR">jason rivers</person>too eight awawa was in addition to this offense about seven games into the season a year ago june jones was saying hey yeah we do not have a good draw game were lining up in the shotgun we need a way to block it like a draw but to get more the suction from those defensive players and sell in the past until theyve gone to the shovel pass he says we block it like a draw we just go ahead and shovel it forward and if you combine the numbers that allow i had running the football with the shovel pass hed be over 1,300 yards this season it has a great point that is pretty much a running play for them first down in ten after the gain of 33 yards making a couple attackers down at the 23yard line as we go down to hitler on the side all marked no coincidence that nicky law what keith s running to the left those two plays both to its left side the reason why he s got a deep bruise in his left heel he said there s no pain when he goes straight ahead but plenty of pain when he s planting and cutting to his right so joan said it s simple well just keep him going to his left he opted out of having a cortisone shot not even wearing tape because he doesnt feel like he has good grip on the field so far i think the plans working just fine for hawaii how was it enjoyed through a lot of adversity the coaches at times have challenged his work ethic undergone shoulder surgery knee surgery came in here at 185 pounds as a freshman his 248 and goes down under the weight of that defensive front for the sun devils back at the 28 yard line penal walter white making a stop blitzing the arizona state is gonna have to bring pressure at times in this football game you just dont line up and cover the warriors down the football field you got to disrupt<person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">colt brennan</person>youve got to get into the backfield create some second and long and third and long situations the sun devils one of the better pass rushing teams in the pac10 over the course of this season the last time arizona state played there not the starting quarterback from arizona out of the ball third and 13 to hawaiian well receiver screen best tries to turn it up more sound actually that <person player="ian sample" race="UNK" position="WR">sample</person> and <person player="ian sample" race="UNK" position="WR">sample</person> is gonna stop the short of the first down into saying it s a loose ball down the field damn estes today came out of the pile with the ball it s going to remain hawaii football fourth down coming up in<person player="dan kelly" race="UNK" position="K">dan kelly</person>placed upon coming onto the field for the warriors so the sun devils name it able to stop them down to the 25 thumps <person player="dan kelly" race="UNK" position="K">kelly</person> was 11 of 14 on the year to try an attempt to feel bowl here this offense for who i led the country 74 touchdowns second place team in that category louisville 58 touchdowns quite a difference between the number one number two teams in the country so big stop whenever you force a field goal try by the warriors this coming from 42 yards out and he pulls it to the left he struggled in their last game against oregon state missing two early ones but that was under severe windy conditions bit of a

go with the first period the jones and mike jones still on his feet just like the famous rapper mike jones back then they didnt want him now he s hot theyre all on him tones were the first down this was an exceptional ball from<person player="rudy carpenter" race="UNK" position="QB">rudy carpenter</person>fade route up the sidelines and jones a great job of going up high securing the football pretty good coverage by the warriors in the secondary you look at the quarterbacks for hawaii not very big five nine and five ten arizona state s going to try to exploit the size event looking good in the early part of the ballgame down to the 45 terrain on to carry that time and time for the 30 30 update with rece <person player="dexter davis" race="UNK" position="DL">davis</person> rhys mark i

wide kyle larson couldnt even get it down denver hangs on 24:23 and peyton manning goes over 4,000 yards for the seventh straight year that is an nfl record but the colts lost sportscenter after the game the right reese can imagine the worst way to push a foot football terrain fumbling again extinguish arizona state s mike jones hey that s why he s arguably the best centerfielder on the baseball team he can field a little bit and catch like he did on the previous play team s come over for the mainland for a bowl game sometimes for a regular season game and youve got football players or on mopeds theyre swimming theyre surfing he always wonder how theyre gonna react orion terrain has not come out in this football game and looked very focused securing the football very fortunate that jones was able to cover the football in four terrain whose duty picked up a few yards on the seat bench as well <person player="dexter davis" race="UNK" position="DL">davis</person> is 73 moving

coach glanville a defensive coordinator this week i said coach he gonna bring some safeties up gonna get him involved against this impressive run game for the sun devils he said david there s gonna be a whole lot more people in just two safeties up on the line of scrimmage he talked to coach glanville and he said were not going to have anybody playing any deeper than seven eight yards and you can see it early in this football game hawaii really committing to the line of scrimmage and id like to set at the top<person player="rudy carpenter" race="UNK" position="QB">rudy carpenter</person>is gonna have some shots down the field on second down like they were trying to set up a little jailbreak screen but it s incomplete and <person player="rudy carpenter" race="UNK" position="QB">carpenter</person> ended up on his wallet back of the 42 yard line and jerry glanville keeps an interesting stat he likes to put hits on the quarterback at 21 he says that s when things start to happen in their favor all right so we get the quarterback on his back 20 times and it doesnt have to be a sack he talks about putting the quarterback on the turf after the release of the football he counts that as well but he says after 20 times then i go ahead and tell him were going to switch up the defense he says that s when this turn third down and 12 coming up for the sun does sean do witty in the backfield the three receiver formation and pressure coming off the edge they almost got to him and it s incomplete in the end zone but they dialed up a little bit of heat as<person player="adam leonard" race="UNK" position="LB">adam leonard</person>applied the pressure on <person player="rudy carpenter" race="UNK" position="QB">carpenter</person> forcing the

position="WR">rivers</person> at the 39yard jason delivers with the catch and the first down for the warriors a big question after this game is over and i know a lot of people out here on oahu want to know the answer will col brendan move on and go to the pros and these are the type of throws that make you think he might be ready to move on <person player="jason rivers" race="UNK" position="WR">rivers</person> in a bunch formation running the post corner route and look at that ball out on time i mean this guy is a spot thrower and his movement in the pocket sliding to his left very effective picked up 17 yards on that play compete bryce moans grice mullins down to the 32 brought down by ryan mccoy and for more on brendan let s go to heather david was just talking about his decision whether or not to go to the nfl he told me he s relying on coach jones as expertise to really guide him through that decision coach jones then told me that tomorrow morning even though it s christmas he s going to fax the junior nfl evaluation request form to the nfl offices which starts the process then six scouts from six different teams evaluate both by january 15th which provides <person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">colt</person> the info he and his family need to decide whether or not hell declare himself eligible for the draft guys suck him down into a lot depending on that feedback but he gets from the various teams and scouts and given time again going up top and it s incomplete intended for christ mullins but coverage on the corner from <person player="jeremy payton" race="UNK" position="DB">jeremy</person> peyton what do you think you think he s out or he s coming back what would you recommend well if i was i was acting as an advisor for <person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">colt</person> <person player="brent miller" race="UNK" position="TE">brent</person> and i would tell him to come back for another year and you visit with the coaches for hawaii they talk about him getting in the weight room some more getting more of an nfl body and i agree he s not quite strong enough yet he doesnt quite have the presence in the pocket you know he s got great intangibles he has the accuracy but i think he will improve significantly in terms of the draft order if he stays for one more year here under jun jun <person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">brennan</person> who s nine at 11 ill shuffle pass and this is complete to a llama who got the first down passing the 13 out of the 29<person player="mike nixon" race="UNK" position="LB">mike nixon</person>made the stop actually dragged him forward it appeared david to give him the first down well we talked about mouse <person player="dexter davis" race="UNK" position="DL">davis</person> he now is he the running backs coach birth hawaii but back at portland state when he had quarterbacks like june jones and nia lomax the quarterbacks were lining up under center now they go from the shotgun and to run that effective draw action you gotta use the shovel pass and just one more wrinkle over the years to really help this offense along become as effective as it s been over the course of this season <person player="dexter davis" race="UNK" position="DL">davis</person> the usfl the cfl took them out back then first down in ted wow it s those shoulders squared away we sat down to the 23 here s what head coach jones had to say about his starting quarterback i just basically told him you know that you know waffle what ive seen off your junior college film i think you might be one of the best ones that ive ever looked at and if you trust me on this and walk on i said in a year or two you might be the first quarterback taken in the national football league the tune jones says physically he s the best that ive coached and that includes guys like jeff george who says he threw the ball better but doesnt make all the plays that <person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">brennan</person> has so far and second down and five trying to make a play here throw him back against his body and it s dropped <person player="ian sample" race="UNK" position="WR">sample</person> was wide open and might have had himself six points he walks into the end zone if he makes this catch and the quarterbacks quarterbacks that can throw from different platforms and different arm positions i think theyre theyre going to be the quarterback so you have the most success with and how about throwing back against his body finding <person player="ian sample" race="UNK" position="WR">sample</person> moving back to his right that just gives you a snapshot of the athletic ability of<person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">colt brennan</person>on that last play should have gone for six drop down three quarters on that third down and five coming up now ix play the hawaii drive brennon he s going to be sacked back at the 25yard line and fourth down coming up for the warriors looks like june jones is going to go with cali again another field goal try and after that first less list by <person player="dan kelly" race="UNK" position="K">kelly</person> this is a bit of a decision here for june jones i know that he had to think about it there because his offense very capable of picking up third and sixth and this picnic um from about 42 yards out this one earlier today from this very distance in the first quarter knocks this one through as hawaii finally gets on the scoreboard after about 18 minutes when we come back<person player="rudy carpenter" race="UNK" position="QB">rudy carpenter</person>who was the subject of a lot of controversy to start the season still trying to

stopped up at the 28 yard line well this was a very vitriolic august and offseason prior to this season for arizona state when you talk about the quarterback in position<person player="rudy carpenter" race="UNK" position="QB">rudy carpenter</person>was named the starter and sam keller transferred to nebraska this after certain information became available after the head coach dirk cutter actually named keller the starter so he switched his mind then they won the first three games under <person player="rudy carpenter" race="UNK" position="QB">carpenter</person> then they went oh and three after that even out at 500 dirk cutter after their win against arizona in their last game was dismissed given the option to coach this last game dennis erickson hired as the new head coach<person player="rudy carpenter" race="UNK" position="QB">rudy carpenter</person>was in the middle of a very stormy shaunda witty the tailback on first down in ten play fake tons of room <person player="rudy carpenter" race="UNK" position="QB">carpenter</person> with real estate all the way out to midfield of 50 yard line where he s finally stopped up but more than enough for the first down for the sun

season just to get his confidence level back up well in the opening two games of the pac10 schedule<person player="rudy carpenter" race="UNK" position="QB">rudy carpenter</person>had really lost his

more look you cant play a receiver on a deep ball any better than this now luis was all over jones and look at him watch the eyes of jones the jerry glanville the defensive coordinator teaches these defensive backs to never look back for the football they squat at the arm and they watch the eyes of the receiver you would see a lot of defensive coordinators coach that type of defense in the secondary that land had a lot of success over the years conspicuous by his silence so far the guy who just saw miller as i set up the screen to delidio ass nice blocking ahead of him delayed he s still on his feet picking up the first down at the 24 yard line of hawaii a wellexecuted play a pickup of 26 he lined up against the defense that s taking big shots at you looking to intimidate you as an offense playing aggressively if you can spring a couple welltimed screen passes you can make some hay great timing by <person player="rudy carpenter" race="UNK" position="QB">carpenter</person> to sell the pass and then drop the football down to do it get to see <person player="keegan herring" race="UNK" position="RB">keegan</person> accidentally lucky to you earlier this hélène brought down a

allamerican tight end still without a reception of his game has had trouble with tightens all year long oregon state big joe newton had a lot of success arizona state figures to exploit that we can go for it here david on fourth down in the 17 yard line fourth and t to go marketer incomplete they blew the play up purcell came up huge with the pressure on <person player="rudy carpenter" race="UNK"

so called brief counted six the magic number is 20 first down 2/10 coming back the other way the surprisingly lowscoring game 239 pounds tackle him if you can first down you know david already in this game ive seen some tvs wanting to hit him that time walter white came up and missed the tackle he shown us some moves that have absolutely frozen safeties for arizona state the zach cat nice a big part of this defense is already down he may not return<person player="josh barrett" race="nonwhite" position="DB">josh barrett</person>when the top safeties in the country number 19 eventually makes the tackle but allow at 250 pounds he s shown the ability to gain the corner first down in 10 and now we are mostly regression nicely in farms a receiver the 43yard that was<person player="jason rivers" race="UNK" position="WR">jason rivers</person>who made the catch the 62 junior member states print check to the speed to get open working against walter white and not many quarterbacks have the confidence of their head coach to slide to the left and then throw crossing routes back across their body but that is a big part of this run and shoot office slot receivers working down the field now this is really the pioneer offense the first offensive scheme work wide receivers have the ability to switched their routes up after the snap of the football picked up of 11 yards its first and 10 and he s picked off that time one too many in the direction of<person player="josh barrett" race="nonwhite" position="DB">josh barrett</person>and he made him pay brennon who s completed 72% on the season that time with the first turnover the ballgame for hawaii well they were looking for <person player="jason rivers" race="UNK" position="WR">rivers</person> on the fade and this is just a great job by <person player="josh barrett" race="nonwhite" position="DB">barrett</person> getting over the top the<person player="josh barrett" race="nonwhite" position="DB">josh barrett</person>is going to play at the next level or threespeed he s actually been timed in a sub for three several times and workouts the arizona state a big hitter as nice size for a safety you love safeties that can play the football on the air first down in ten even <person player="keegan herring" race="UNK" position="RB">herring</person> in the ball it s a lot easier maybe dodging hawaii defenders than it is trunks on a

game he s very good in space against the basket as one of the team s defensive mvp second down and six per arizona state mike jones theyre gonna rule the complete jones doing a nice job of keeping those feet inbounds at the 48 yard line jones uh pretty much becoming the comfort zone with what about commuting <person player="rudy carpenter" race="UNK" position="QB">carpenter</person> pick up 15 i think the store you see the drastic drop off offensively for the sun devils off of last year they are the number two offense in the country a year ago 519 yards a game but just a decimated group of wide receivers not not just not just in terms of injury graduations sundevils lost eric hagen the alltime leader in receptions ten history airing back in the ballgame he lost a hat bearing has brought down about the 47 yard line by<person player="adam leonard" race="UNK" position="LB">adam leonard</person>the people talked about the dropoff with <person player="rudy carpenter" race="UNK"

ballgame and part of the reason why they nicknamed him trained vote at that time for the first down at the 37 yard line to ralph it went over 190 yards against tao and this this turned into a running it s i know the sun devils look to that oregon state hawaii tape and watch the way that the beavers control the ball on the ground that figured to be a big hardest ball game controlling this football

point that with the running shoot thing and with<person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">colt brennan</person>chasing clinger 54 touchdown regan now we are now in a tailback as awawa comes out and <person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">brennan</person> is 11 of 15 so far but being interception on the last sequence related to the arizona state touchdown this pass complete to <person player="jason rivers" race="UNK" position="WR">rivers</person> making a stop on the play for arizona state you know what david it s interesting with the last game being coached by dirk cutter of arizona state right now it would be easy for the players and the coaching staff on mass to just let go of the rope but so far with 401 to go in the first half theyve acquitted themselves extremely well this is a team that came in prepared and ready to play that says a lot about the intent of the resolve of burke let it ride dirk cutter to the great job keeping his team focused when it looked like some work an abandoned ship on the sun devils after those two crushing defeats against allen or silver clasp power 45 yard line a little bit more about the rally jonas had

we talked about some of the problems he came in that conditioning drills a year ago really disappointed june jones june was furious about his condition coming into the 2005 season but you look at his

is all freshman in the pac10 in a freshman allamerican with the sack his seventh of the season and the third of the game for the team that s a new per asa down on the field for hawaii well and if youre gonna have success against this offense number one offense in the country in total yards scoring offense and look like oop arrest got bent backwards and and the right knee was compromised there but all the numbers that this hawaii offense has put up youve got to get them behind the chains you got to get them second in long situations third and long situations in arizona state having some success getting pressure on<person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">colt brennan</person>in the pocket and creating sacks he s a key part of that offensive line jones has sent five

the last five years over the thousands of miles he s traveled the one constant in<person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">colt brennan</person>s life has been changed that s the one thing there s been nothing normal or kind of generic about my journey it s been pretty up and down and sideways the journey began in southern california at mater dei high school whereas skinny <person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">brennan</person> started only his senior year as a sophomore in junior he backed up mat liner before the allamerican went to usc we had spent so much time together that one thing we did he became pretty good friends and you know it was great to watch him he looked up to me as a football player but just kind of as a person i think and that was something that i kind of took him under my wing but we became boys after graduation <person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">brennan</person> spent a year at a prep school before colorado invited him to walk on as a freshman but any hope of playing for the buffs still smarting from a recent sex scandal vanished when he was charged with unlawful sexual conduct criminal trespass and burglary after an incident in a female students dorm room i obviously put myself into a bad situation that night you know i was drinking you know i as far as my character that night i didnt use the best judgment i just told them like man it s gonna make you stronger get through it youll be fine people are gonna people are gonna forget about it s in the past you cant do anything about it you cant change the past after he was told to leave the team and during the months it took for his case to be heard <person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">brennan</person> s footprints led back to california and saddleback junior college where he starred for the gauchos during the fall of 2004 they saved me man that school went to balcony because they did that i mean that s why im here and that s why i was able to move on my wife in january of 2005 <person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">brennan</person> was exonerated of the sexual misconduct charges but sentenced to seven days in jail community service in four years probation for criminal trespass and burglary most schools that had expressed interest in him backed away but not hawaii coach june jones was satisfied with his personal background check of <person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">brennan</person> everybody said you know he s the greatest kid he s a winner and everybody had positive things to say about him jones invited <person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">brennan</person> to walk on with the warriors i remember saying to him that you know let me just say this you know you go to those other schools and you might get drafted in the late rounds if you come here i think youll be the first quarterback taken and if you dont have the courage to walk on then youre not the guy i thought you were he was like hey im here if you want to come and be the man you couldnt be the man if not ill get on my plane and go home and find someone else to be the man in three years the 63 190 pound junior has smashed records in jones past powered off leading hawaii to its best season in history and jones ranks him among the top three quarterbacks he s ever coached college or pro he is accurate as jeff george is as competitive as warren and jim <person player="dan kelly" race="UNK" position="K">kelly</person> and he s probably more mobile than than all of them it has taken five years the<person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">colt brennan</person>has finally reached the end of his journey stopping at a place unique to any other for footprints even the missteps in colorado are beginning to wash away it was a smile on my face to know what he s doing you know because ive known him since he was younger and to see him persevere through everything i was good for me though because then i had to man up real fast and i had to really figure out what was what was important and you know as much as it hurts it was it was good for me cole brendan s path to stardom hasnt been the most usual one but it might take a path to even brighter star stage next year doug tell you what people are getting the glimpse of him tonight he s thrown for over 50 touchdown passes<person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">colt brennan</person>is for real and he s gonna have a shot next year to heisman he s coming back he s gonna keep slinging it under jim jones i know darren mcfadden is coming back hell be the frontrunner but<person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">colt brennan</person>is gonna throw imma shoot he s on his way next year possible heisman well there are always quarterbacks put up great statistic you look the ones at texas tech when you looked at houston under john jenkins and you look at them under june jones but here s the difference<person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">colt brennan</person>is a legitimate pro prospect june jones tells everybody this guy has all the talent to be a great nfl quarterback it s not only jim jones it s the coaches that are on the other side lines like a pat <person player="jordan hill" race="UNK" position="DL">hill</person> and chris peterson that have told us he can make every throw that s out there and not only that he can distribute the ball extremely well five different receivers have at least 47 catches on this team led by davon best it has 81 catches over 87 yards a game that he averages not only that he s a smart quarterback he sees the feel very well and he knows where to go with the football i like his decisionmaking on the field yeah he s put up these ridiculous numbers and he s been sitting out the fourth quarter in six of the games so i mean he still it s not like theyre trying to run up these he s just letting it happen yeah marla the system at all yeah i gotta practice exactly i was gonna ask doug about that you guys talked about how he could make the throws in any offense how does it help him to be in this type of offense where they spread it around and throw it to la today but youre used to them leaning on you and used to use of the coaches saying hey the balls in your hands you go win the game and making all the throws like mark said that s what it s all about in the nfl making all the throws and being in this kind of system goal brendan probably have an opportunity to do that if he continues putting up the numbers he has so far for june jones waitll mark and the guys see what vince young is able to do now mark s gonna be left speechless by vich young s latest performance and getting the

heather <person player="rodney cox" race="UNK" position="DB">cox</person> down in the field from all of us at espn to all of you at home season s greetings well in the first half matt leinart former high school teammate really struggled<person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">colt brennan</person>the guy that led the nation in six different statistical categories never really got on track at least in terms of getting his team into the end zone yeah points are what is critical but they had nice numbers the drop by<person player="ian sample" race="UNK" position="WR">ian sample</person>was a touchdown <person player="ian sample" race="UNK" position="WR">sample</person> would have walked in that <person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">brennan</person> he s not been clean in the pocket arizona state has been able to get to him at times theyve had some pee sacks you saw the pic by<person player="josh barrett" race="nonwhite" position="DB">josh barrett</person>over the top and the big hit by darren ware but hawaii theyre going to just keep on doing what theyve been doing for years theyre gonna keep on testing you in the secondary <person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">brennan</person> s got to be careful not to take sacks but hawaii very capable of scoring points the problem arizona state given up less than eight points a game when you just count the second half theyve been a very tough defensive ballclub in the second half over the course of the year let s talk about the sun devil offense you know about the midway point of the season<person player="rudy carpenter" race="UNK" position="QB">rudy carpenter</person>was struggling during the bye week he went back home to the football field murray watch some kids play pop warner kind of got his mojo back and really playing confident today a nice job placing the ball down the sidelines of mike jones here he drops it underneath the<person player="brent miller" race="UNK" position="TE">brent miller</person>is tied in and then this ball on the touchdown to<person player="brandon smith" race="UNK" position="WR">brandon smith</person>that s a beautiful throw and<person player="rudy carpenter" race="UNK" position="QB">rudy carpenter</person>is capable of making all the throws you dont lead the country and passing efficiency without being able to put the ball on the money and i think<person player="rudy carpenter" race="UNK" position="QB">rudy carpenter</person>is going to continue to try to take advantage of the aggressiveness of this hawaii defense <person player="malcolm lane" race="UNK" position="WR">lane</person> and dickinson back to the kickoff for the warriors and kicked about six yards deep in hawaii well start off on its own 20 we go downstairs to head hawaiian coach jones said that the nation s best offenses stagnant because theyre making poor decisions that were moving the ball fine but were making bad decisions especially in the red zone and were just not making the right throws i asked him about his quarterback<person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">colt brennan</person>in his health he said hell be just fine well start and play this entire second half the other thing he had it defensively weve gotta put more pressure on arizona state to get the ball back and allow our offense to do our thing guys right first down in 10 from the 20 yard line llama at tailback right pass complete to <person player="jason rivers" race="UNK" position="WR">rivers</person> to the first down 13 working against walter white take a look at the first half numbers one good number that jumps up the screen at you when you think about it that s not there is the turnover that led to the touchdown for arizona state pick you look at the rushing yards as well arizona state continuing to have success on the ground they ran the ball for more than 2,000 yards this season and hawaii is going to have to make better decisions <person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">brennan</person> had pretty good numbers but theyre going to have to be more efficient getting the ball to their two great slots and he does here slings it complete first down it appears a reception by<person player="jason rivers" race="UNK" position="WR">jason rivers</person>his second consecutive former state sprint champ whose his speed to make a play anat im making the stop we talked about the intransigence the stout nature that arizona state defense in the second half of ballgames this year just under eight points a game alive theyre gonna get the first down to hawaii that is a astounding statistic when you look at the effectiveness of bill miller s defense they played kau oregon and usc in consecutive games i really thought that game against the trojans even though they lost in the fourth quarter i thought that was a turning point and they have really regrouped down the stretch and into the ball game as they playing inspired defense for their head coach their cutter who s coaching us in last came at the helm and allow got a nice block up front over the left side of that offensive line in halawa with almost another first down it looks like theyre close to it boy he is quick at 250 pounds and most packs and have that type of frame 248 man he told us 248 come on im not gonna give up for 2 pounds but you have a back that big normally he wants to get it upfield north/south and he watched allow he s always looking to bounce the ball outside interesting matchup in that bowl mana tide is his cousin he s the middle linebacker for arizona state so they should have some nice family collisions <person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">brennan</person> with wide open a real estate and wisely going down shy of the 30 at the 32 yard line doesnt want to take another huge hit like he did from toronto where late in the first half that time he picked up 14 david well and you look at the way defenses play as we take a look at some of the numbers astounding over 47 points a game they lead the nation in that category and then you look at the lack of production today but i think the mix of running past is what is going to give hawaii back in the football game teams love to play this team to pass the ball obviously theyre going to be opportunities for <person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">brennan</person> to pull the ball down and opportunity for the tailbacks to run the football this david has been kind of quiet so far in this gir tucked up and down punishing cruising running but there s a flag down on the play this one might come back the flag down at the 26 yard line so just like in the first half david had a nice run wiped out by an infraction a holding call that looks like it s coming back yeah this might have been the right tackle day new for essa number 72 first down and that s the second big holding call an uber esse and both have been on big gains the <person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">brennan</person> s just going to release the underneath handoff watch the move allow it puts on<person player="justin tryon" race="nonwhite" position="DB">justin tryon</person>when the top tackling corner backs in the pac10 just absolutely loses him and then he punishments mccoy the safety to finish off the run that s got the speed of a ferrari in the body the chassis of a hummer that s the h2 supersized first and 15 after the penalty mallya is in for allow receiver screen the buzz loose and pounced on by with marisa so he atones for the holding penalty david by recovering the fumble on the play theyre going to give it back to hawaii one of the dangers of running the smash screen some people called to jailbreak screen is there s a lot of traffic a lot of noise inside for a ride receiver to think about after the catch they really run back into the teeth of the defense dont you fun times warriors very lucky to get that football back <person player="robert james" race="nonwhite" position="LB">james</person> has taken this team to totus seven bowl games in the school s history right now trailing by seven points arizona state conversely looking for its third consecutive bowl victory the last game coach biter cutter second and 16 as a man wide open and i mean wide open touchdown it doesnt come any easier for <person player="jason rivers" race="UNK" position="WR">rivers</person> and with that both <person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">brennan</person> ties the record for touchdown passes in a season with 54 and the meter still running with 1229 to go into third <person player="jason rivers" race="UNK" position="WR">rivers</person> meanwhile with his nine touchdown

those sidelines warning to you tell the officiating true come on you know understandably who i he gets a first touchdown first score of the game the defense is fired up the crowd has fired up it s a big part of this program and their success on the island is the moment soozee azzam at times spoke with a couple of arizona state offensive players they say hey when you watch the tape of hawaii s defense they go for a lot of kill shots theyre trying to knock you out of the game not just tackle the sun devils behind quarterback rudi <person player="rudy carpenter" race="UNK"

the timing is just tremendous on the delivery by <person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">brennan</person> personal foul theyre a little overzealous on the play the key is the timing

got inside the pylon here at that football stretched inside the fire lou jean jones obviously tinkering with the offensive halftime david and making some sound adjustments what do you see is the difference offensively between the first half and what weve seen so far in the third quarter well i think it s just been a great mix of running past june jones calling the plays he s gotten nate allow

sun devisees theyre all america he s their leading receiver on often but he is yet to catch a pass and the offense looking a little disconcerted as to what he makes the catch and 28 yard line art donts david nori had the cops down in the field as arizona state up to do to snatch the momentum that well i think you have to use this aggressiveness hawaii defense against them i think he got to go play action while this defense is fired up take a few shots down the field they gotta use<person player="zach miller" race="white" position="TE">zach miller</person>some as we were talking about mark zack miller has been taken out of the game linebackers have been coming up and taking shots at him and not allowing him to release off the line of scrimmage this is demetri <person player="dimitri nance" race="UNK" position="RB">nance</person> on the short yardage situation and he moves the pile forward theyre going to mark it across the 30yard line for the first down how do you suppose given what you mentioned the linebackers putting hits on sac feather who s probably the biggest part of the offense how did they free him up and counter them well it s tough it s called smoke in them and that s a linebacker coming up on a line on the line of scrimmage within the first five yards and taking shots at the tight end so i think what you have to do is you have to split him out or get him in motion give him a free release because he has definitely won the top two or three tight ends in the country and were gonna run it stay on the ground in terrain moving that file forward shy of the

takes more than that well what s so impressive about<person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">colt brennan</person>s years you can compile completions and attempts and touchdown passes to me what s made it the best statistical year in the history of quarterback in the division one level passing efficiency and completion percentage just tremendous were still on his feet <person

game during the regular season halla stopped up at the line of scrimmage at the 48 yard line the second down intent but getting back to those stats i mean a quarterback you look at quarterbacks across the country if youre throwing the ball 50 60 times a game of course youre going to lead your league and youre gonna lead the country and then attempts and completions but when youve got the completion percentage in the past efficiency is high this<person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">colt brennan</person>back to me signals that this was the best year quarterbacks ever had at this level he has it across the board in terms of the statistics just an incredible year after this play im going to ask you the 6 million dollar question player or system it seems to be the perpetual debate when a quarterback principal body numbers and wanted shoot complete underneath to pass he s still on his feet yards after the carrion and another first down best has been relatively quiet today but let me get back to that brennon question well let s talk about the system and let s talk about devon best devon best is really the featured slot receiver and the featured overall skilled player for hawaii but you talked about those numbers and answer your question mark jones i think the school system is a big part of it you cant take anything away from june jones and house <person

after the play makalah sarah the left tackle for hawaii might have taken his helmet off after the play and picked up an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty thatll be assessed on the kickoff but what a ball from<person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">colt brennan</person>unsportsmanlike conduct number 17 removing his succeeding 2:14 to go in the third quarter this is an offense that has been resurrected here in the second half they had just three points on the board in the first half first of all there s 11 touchdown catch of the season and the extra point good hawaii s surging ahead by 14 points and <person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">brennan</person> continues to mount even more impressive numbers with this type of game as we fourthquarter shawn kings half sufficiency record could be at risk bryce mullins going to run a scene and footprint and flashes some arm strength watch it fit this ball in down the field right out of the cut the grace moen couldnt ask for a better ball this hawaii team is an extremely emotional team and as a watching at midfield now jumping up and down at the 50yard line a way to finish off at ninety nine and a half yard drive warden rendon talking a little bit of smack to arizona state well when you come and play on the island against hawaii and they get a lead and they get some momentum and fans behind them that s been the characteristic theyre not afraid to pick up a 15 yarder here theyre incredibly aggressive approach and to talk a little bit when they get the lead arizona state is going to have to answer where<person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">colt brennan</person>is going to keep this show rolling steel<person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">colt brennan</person>philip the usa nobody comes into the crib and parties right here on us came into the game with 53 touchdown passes three quick ones here in the third quarter and in a blink is up to 56 with two slot receivers for the lorry they just burst on the scene a year ago both went over a thousand yards butoon jones in this offense and if<person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">colt brennan</person>returns i think he will this offense it s a scary thought this offense is going to be even better next year hether downstairs overheard them saying one one more year ill return it s trying trying pushed out of bounds over the 45 at the 43 but the flag is way back to the 33yard he had two flags he got an offside penalty most likely by hawaii on the kickoff and then a blocking infraction against arizona state <person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">brennan</person> is thrown for 185 yards in this quarter alone with 204 to go and three touchdowns a huge second half so far with the meter still running side against the warriors and a block in the back against arizona state on the return go ahead and recap this immersion state as the option you know the type of offense and arizona state has been playing in this game a little bit more methodical using the ground attack illegal block in the back number two of the return team those penalties offset we will recap i started to say before the call david that arizona state not what you would consider a quote unquote big play offense then not the type of team that can catch up to you in big chunks not the way that theyve been playing so far anyway we were a year ago jack yeah they were a year ago with sam keller playing through those first eight games tremendous statistics and then of course he went down with a broken thumb<person player="rudy carpenter" race="UNK" position="QB">rudy carpenter</person>came in dirk cutters offense a year ago nothing short of scintillating especially in the past game 519 yards per game but the loss of skill athletes on the outside the graduation and injuries has really turned this club into a running team in the 2006 season and it and it really i think costs dirk cutters 21 and 28 overall in the pac10 in conference play 2 and 19 it s top 10 teams really sounded you it is disappointing if your arizona statement they in the state of california conference resides close that record over six years without at least taken a little tea innocent wires for avoidance it s big bite there s trying again a nice kickoff return try on still on his feet needs one block and trying with a great return down to the 30yard line as we check in with rece <person player="dexter davis" race="UNK" position="DL">davis</person> has 30 30 update all right mark you never know how a games going to wind up bengals and broncos all cincinnati needed to do is convert the extra points in the game into overtime they botched it end of a bad day for the bengals four turnovers eight penalties loss to the broncos by one michael vick against the panthers went over a thousand yards from the season first quarterback to do that falcons still lost ten three much more on sportscenter after the game posted 10 arizona state <person player="rudy carpenter" race="UNK" position="QB">carpenter</person> put jones and the over shutters receiver jones made a nice last gasp amongst world he was working against nice second and tough he had jones there and that was not an easy throw but that s the throw that <person player="rudy carpenter" race="UNK" position="QB">carpenter</person> makes more times than not comes all the way back across the field as a second choice on the post corner route and if he takes a little off that football that s a touchdown second attempt coming up stones inside of him emotion looking for the out and up big collision touchdown sack miller but there s a flag down on the play there was a huge collision in the end zone zack miller hung on but let s wait and see what the outcome of this flag is is it off ciders at a line of scrimmage and crashing that s an illegal shift on the sun devils derk cutter wants to know why the laminates error by arizona state you see the look of disdain on the face of dirt gutter if youre in motion see if they have two players in motion that is that is pretty tickytack right there and i think what they got i think they got mike jones in the slot for leaving account early while the tight end was in motion and that wipes a tremendous play between quarterback and tight end <person player="rudy carpenter" race="UNK" position="QB">carpenter</person> defense has pitched to shut up here in the second half so far with 123 to go in the third quarter and a little bit of motion

position="DB">barrett</person> part of what they do defensively at arizona state his penalty against hawaii <person player="josh barrett" race="nonwhite" position="DB">barrett</person> is a big part of the steep that sees that the most talented member of arizona state s defense and as sun devils lost zach cat nice his safety mate in the second series of this ball game arguably the two most talented players for arizona state defensive leader on were pretty talented in his own right at that linebacker but the sun devils starting to get thin in the secondary estaban vests sometimes in the course of youthful exuberance there is a little over two brands frankly i think it s tough to suppress that kind of emotion that is what i got no problem with guys bumping their gums once in a while but there s plenty of gum bumping over here in the islands historically with hawaii when they get up and they get it rolling there s plenty of talking that goes on and teams know when they come in sugar cutter warned his team beware the talking there s gonna be a couple hits that are gonna come pretty close to the whistle maybe a bit after the whistle and hawaii s going to try to take shots on defense and try to knock players out of the game this is a prostyle attack by hawaii the jerry glanville employs and sometimes he get tested with a flag or two official still discussing this down to

40yard line that is right at the first down marker this seemed what kind of spot he gets and whether it is indeed a first down it looks like theyre going to give it to him right at the 40yard line this is the problem that you face on defense even when you get to the quarterback<person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">colt brennan</person>has such a quick release that he s able to get the ball out hey watch the blitz by gathol off the left side he was on the<person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">colt brennan</person>quickly but the ball came out boom that s one of the intangibles atuned jones talks about<person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">colt brennan</person>see toughness his quick release sitting in under pressure it s not often david that you can have a quarterback come in on the heels of timmy chang almost reduced to be tagged to an afterthought of sorts i mean he has really eclipsed talanted think that timmy chang has done it the chang was no slouch and timmy chang was a heck of a player but he neither<person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">colt brennan</person>much gate will come off the edge here i just think<person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">colt brennan</person>is hands down the most talented quarterback that theyve had it hawaii that was an impressive play by for brandon who s going to take the hit and he deliver the ball right on the money hello a year ago this time a walkon at quarterback complete bella floors down this was chat bought the senior with his first action game she played with ashley lily here the great wide receiver that to the nfl jimmy chang masses for over seventeen thousand yards he had chad owens the great slot receiver but<person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">colt brennan</person>has a very deep group of receivers best and bryce mullen of course for the featured guys in the slot but there are a lot of other guys that tune jones can dial up in his play call from the sidewalk picked up 15 on that catch goes down from the 25yard line nice straight arm a stiff arm onderon where who made the tackle for arizona state we talked about<person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">colt brennan</person>through 53 touchdown passes over in oh susan led the country six different categories was not invited to new york s downtown i asked him about it david he said had they want that game against oregon state i might have been a little bit more vociferous and my complaints about not being invited but they lost the game so he didnt have to popular well and he had an opportunity to win that game down the stretch and he bounced the ball on fourth down to an open <person player="jason rivers" race="UNK" position="WR">rivers</person> on the outside and you know i thought it showed maturity the collbran said i didnt deserve to go back there after not winning that game looking for bests mess was open temporarily a little bit off the mark we just saw the graphic a few moments ago sorry david troy smith and brady quinn guys it obviously were there at the downtown athletic club brennidon it was not that plays into<person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">colt brennan</person>s decision on whether he comes back youre gonna have brady quinn come out troy smith obviously gonna come out get brian braun from louisville they look at their numbers there i think<person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">colt brennan</person>his best served he s gonna have a significant jump in the draft if he waits another year continues to develop he s gonna be working with you and jones and mous <person player="dexter davis" race="UNK" position="DL">davis</person> see before is going to be tremendous one year more experienced third down and 11 they set up the screen allow and it s incomplete at the 24yard line they just missed on that one at a time and<person player="dexter davis" race="UNK" position="DL">dexter davis</person>with the pressure that time for the sun devils pull it down and comes the fieldgoal unit but by tenkill that was a nice play by doron where number 18 to read that screen pass and get a hand over the top this is such a tough defense or a tough offense excuse me to play because of their ability to throw the ball downfield and then spring that shovel pass and little runs underneath to allow one of two so far today and this one is true by<person player="dan kelly" race="UNK" position="K">dan kelly</person>increasing the warriors lead to 17 points

especially in the past two years of new texas of course this year but boy usc a team that was right up in the mix until the final week of that upset against ucla both of those teams right after the final week to play figure to have shots to play the national title in a no lloyd carr his team feel very strongly they still deserve to be in that game fair catch called at the 15yard line just under 15 minutes ago brother mark jones along with david nori and heather cots down in the field turfcutter is coaching his last game for arizona state dennis erickson will take over as the head coach of the football program immediately following this game dirk cutter there have been some whispers about him being connected with various nfl jobs marvin lewis is a very desirous guy of his work holmgren in seattle an associate of his and that miami offensive coordinator job still open there s no doubt with coach cutter comes out of that pipeline of oregon the offensive coordinators for mike bilotti guys like bob toledo jeff tedford and terrain doing him proud on this kerry terrain still on his feet felt like a record on a turntable and terrain finally pulls up at the 20yard line dragged down by<person player="leonard peters" race="UNK" position="DB">leonard peters</person>but a huge chunk of yardage on one play by ryan terrain who almost seemed to run out of steam there at the end just a tremendous job by terrain he s gonna run off tackle left side action reads the scene well and then the cutback set up this run broken tackle how about that play tremendous balance he just didnt have the angle he wasnt rundown in terms of his speed he just didnt have the angle that was taken away by the broken tackle what an effort why are you gonna call the timeout arizona state showing a lot of vigor here in the fourth quarter that s the second longest run in bowl history at 60 plus yard run by terrain now what does that do for them what do you think of their strategy obviously theyd like to keep the ball on the ground this late well i dont think you abandon your game plan hawaii scored 24 unanswered but a big part of your game plan is gonna be continuing to use a run from time to time and then play action play action is what is going to get get an arizona state back in this football game<person player="rudy carpenter" race="UNK" position="QB">rudy carpenter</person>is gonna have to get hot defensively i dont think weve said enough about what hawaii has done all the top was about how impressive the sun devil defense was david in the second half of those ballgames this year but rainbow warrior defense has been very stout here in the second half if there s one thing we found about hawaii it s only a matter of time with this offense bolt <person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">brennan</person> and june jones his quarterback mouse <person player="dexter davis" race="UNK" position="DL">davis</person> theyre all very confident that even if you stop them for a quarter or two theyre gonna have success eventually they always have the ability to make what youre doing on defense be wrong because they have the answers theyve been running this offense for over three decades terrain below nicely at the 16yard line as we go down to heaven well guys i was able to catch up with coach dennis erickson during the week he was in tempe very busy recruiting getting its coaching staff together but he said he will watch this game from home simply as a fan for entertainment wont critique and what i found interesting while he s been in tempe since he was fired he s been working in the same football office as his coach penner they have not spoken he said it s out of respect for coach cutter he wants him to be here with his team it s his team laughter bogan then he hopes the two can talk and theyll do the passing of the torch if you will respectful of what coaches go through it s a very closely knit fraternity second free terrain nice cutback and theyre still around the sun devils storming back the lead has been whittled down to nine with the extra point to follow ryan terrain with his seventh rushing touchdown of the season and you can almost feel the uneasiness here in aloha stadium amongst the hawaii fans of yard touchdown run by ryan terrain appropriate that he would punctuate that drive after we land that long one for over 60 yards that 64 yard chunk to set it up the lead is down to 10 points 27 to 17 and call him trained he was on the right track that time back up this proud sponsor of the sheraton hawaii bowl call your travel

john anderson and steve levy on the desk on the jay obion right now this game just got a little bit more interesting with arizona state s drive a few moments ago brian terrain a big part of that on two very strong runs this is <person player="ross dickerson" race="UNK" position="WR">dickerson</person> there s a flag down at the 12 yard line <person player="ross dickerson" race="UNK" position="WR">dickerson</person> is tackled out of the 44 actually there are three different flags back between the 23 and the 12 yard line once again this is a midamerican conference officiating crew a chance to speak with them before the game they actually liked being out here in hawaii imagine that it s the 82 degree weather we got the call and we were found out were assigned to this ball game i cant say i was disciplined half the distance to the goal first down hawaii the opportunity to come out here and spend some time and mark i know youre gonna spend a couple extra days here in hawaii just magical when the islands waikiki and out here for three or four days and the weather s been spectacular sheridan both people have been extremely cordial and hospitable and indigenous people here have been wonderful june jones and his coaching staff a chance to visit with them this has been a wonderful experience in the lemon groves down in 10 team leading by 10 just in the 12 minutes to go meharry he s tackled about the 12 yard line now david we talked about the runandshoot for most of the night how do you burn time off the clock in the runner chute or kenya well that s one of the weaknesses of this offense is trying to the mill clock as we look at mouse <person player="dexter davis" race="UNK" position="DL">davis</person> that the mentor the originator of the runandshoot offense were walking down the <person player="jordan hill" race="UNK" position="DL">hill</person> portland oregon watching em coach june jones under center neal lomax i watched neal lomax s offense put up a hundred and five points one afternoon against delaware state but you know weakness of this offense youre gonna get plenty of possessions here in the fourth quarter if youre arizona state marker so visit kainalu i kind of equated super suck in the bond in television just when you think youre out of it youre really in it when you keep you the game you do a lot of nba basketball youve seen the phoenix suns and it might be an inappropriate time to bring this up suns after they ran off 15 in a row but the phoenix suns you know if youre down by 15 16 17 points youre going to get enough possessions to get back in the game and arizona state i think theyre talking on the sidelines plenty of time youre trailing by 17 that touchdown got them right back in the game and with over 11 minutes to go plenty of time to pull a comeback here in the eyes first down and catch by brian christ mullin battle to join injuries for most of the season was really slowed down as a result of that but has caught a couple of beautiful pivotal pantry passes in this one first and ten coming up market motion he fumbled it try and gun and the sun devils get a gift at the hawaii 27 yard line down by just ten with plenty of time to play that thing came squirting out of the arms of allow i think was<person player="jeremy payton" race="UNK" position="DB">jeremy payton</person>the backup safety that got his arm in and stripped the football and peyton was victimized on the deep ball two <person player="jason rivers" race="UNK" position="WR">rivers</person> bryce mullen broke a tackle down near the goal line that was peyton and a nice play by number seven to get the ball back to<person player="rudy carpenter" race="UNK" position="QB">rudy carpenter</person>with a short field working with the short field as you said at the 27 yard line so rain in the backfield two tight ends two little ace formation here <person player="rudy carpenter" race="UNK" position="QB">carpenter</person> mass is going to be ruled complete what a catch by mike jones at the 4 yard line donna foot inbounds and its first and goal for arizona state after the 23 yard catch these are the kind of throws that<person player="rudy carpenter" race="UNK" position="QB">rudy carpenter</person>is fully capable of snapping off on post corner route and he still when that ball once again as a second choice defensive backs are taught to read your eyes <person player="rudy carpenter" race="UNK" position="QB">carpenter</person> came from all the way over on the left side back to the corner out and delivered a perfect ball and <person player="rudy carpenter" race="UNK" position="QB">carpenter</person> throwing his arms heavenward in frustration play as under review based on the replay that we showed a few moments ago david appeared as if there was no decision there that mike jones did get that one foot down unless there s a question as to whether he had possession at the time looks like a pretty clean catch he s in and he got a foot down clearly the arizona state ball first and goal inside the five my jones the starting centerfielder on arizona state s baseball team hit 326 last year started lost in six games of the season and interesting that he and kyle will you we have a centerfield controversy on the football team because<person player="kyle williams" race="UNK" position="WR">kyle williams</person>is also very talented centerfielder on the arizona state baseball team well this wide receiver for was midway through the season <person player="terry richardson" race="UNK" position="WR">richardson</person> louis yet birches all hurt not playing and a young group had to step up and learn the position on the fly guys like the gay hey whoo now to fit catch in the rivalry game for a touchdown the first quarter against arizona theyve gotten this team on the move jones has had a terrific game against hawaii and four catches today david for 68 yards but those four catches all four first downs he s worked the sidelines well and he s run a couple fade routes that were crisp but how about<person player="rudy carpenter" race="UNK" position="QB">rudy carpenter</person>now their neighborhood throwers at quarterback that will put the ball somewhere in the neighborhood on it then theyre spot throwers guys that will put it on a spot and place it on a receiver beauty <person player="rudy carpenter" race="UNK" position="QB">carpenter</person> as a spot roll six four three inch 208 pounds something emerging as a extremely pebble optional wide receiver it has been relatively quiet today and there s a look at <person player="rudy carpenter" race="UNK" position="QB">carpenter</person> city <person player="rudy carpenter" race="UNK" position="QB">carpenter</person> lost <person player="terry richardson" race="UNK" position="WR">richardson</person> and jamal lewis <person player="rudy burgess" race="UNK" position="WR">burgess</person> as well they totaled over a hundred catches a year ago and were not even talking about the hagan and motts and matt miller who had to move on mention <person player="nate kimbrough" race="UNK" position="WR">kimbrough</person> write him too and with this slowdown in the action david you think that affects the perceived momentum or otherwise for arizona state i think if this as long as this play holds up i think dirt cutters gonna be plenty happy to get the ball first and goal inside the five and this has become part of college football number two three years ago we didnt have a review coach is really not choosing to use their review flags much in college football i think theyre gonna look at that during the offseason because every place being reviewed upstairs as it is and why would you ever need a fly lady talkin to a season ago led the nation in passing efficiency this year it s to put it back across the field both <person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">brennan</person> is official now coming on the field with the call it took a while and i think theyre trying to see if he s secured the football first thing reset the game clock to ten i dont think there was any question that he had a foot down and bound say were looking very carefully to make sure that jones secured the football made a nice clean catch with his hands on the sidelines arizona state looking for its third consecutive benefit it would be the last head coach dirk cut first and goal while just inside the five serrated miller loading up out of the offset i martha dare to change touchdown like jones there s a flag down back at the 19yard line is gonna go against the white i think this is a late hit on<person player="rudy carpenter" race="UNK" position="QB">rudy carpenter</person>by akaike allama francis arizona state s going to be kicking off from close to midfield and what a play by<person player="rudy carpenter" race="UNK" position="QB">rudy carpenter</person>he was looking at a highlow route combination to the right side and then threw across his body roughing the passer the but he came all the way back to the left mark jones to find jones on a crossing route that was a heck of a throw wonderful offensive execution was pivotal on that drive it catched him get them down to the 4 yard line there s a mistake with the extra part now just three points away with 10 25 to go in the fourth quarter a reallife rudy in action this is not hollywood this is bigger and better we talked about dirk cutter coming out of that oregon pipeline here s jones he s in motion youre gonna get a highlow from the fullback in the tight in and then jones is gonna work back against the flow he s going to get caught underneath linebackers and great patience by <person player="rudy carpenter" race="UNK" position="QB">carpenter</person> a sidearm throw that was put right on target sells the right side comes back to jones what a game mike jones s happens normally has like his namesake the famous trapper dont act like you dont know the name it s mike jones and here s a look at the late hit against a lot of francis after the pass we talked about the toughness of<person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">colt brennan</person>but<person player="rudy carpenter" race="UNK" position="QB">rudy carpenter</person>he s a great leader a competitor really a student of the game gets in studies tape and his teammates love his toughness he has taken a lot of big hits over the course of the season remember david we talked at the top of the show about jerry glenn kills magic number it s set at 20 and after 20 he says that s when quarterbacks start to make mistakes and they often get their picks it s a trend that he s studied in his forty some years in football right now that magic number of 20 theyre not even close to it there are 10 so it says something i think about the way that maybe arizona state is protected <person player="rudy carpenter" race="UNK" position="QB">carpenter</person> this went out the back of the end zone itll come out to the 20yard line uncle beau has gone to the other side just going to say that i was gonna say that it s a game of momentum especially in a big game like this one a bowl game so important for hawaii playing at home hawaii scored 24 unanswered arizona state ooh snatched back that momentum two touchdowns on consecutive drives that one set up by the fumble from naval ah wa coaches working the officiating crew after the extra point a lot of years of experience there between june jones and jerry glanville of course jim jones coaching underneath plan go at the pro level once again it s <person player="jason rivers" race="UNK" position="WR">rivers</person> working against ryan goes down to the 34 yard line they field day against trying to and how about the feet of<person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">colt brennan</person>he is he s got great feet in the pocket he s able to move and find areas seams between defensive lineman to deliver the football i love the way he slides around in the backfield almost like a ballerina and and he is able to free himself up good sight lines down the field then boom the ball comes out with actors if the other plus your passenger golden the need this time to piss yes powering forward after a 48yard line down for hawaii spent some of that momentum back with you cant say enough about this hawaii offensive line and june jones has talked about the offensive line throughout the season really an unsung group at a group that has played at a very high level up front sartet all starts with samson <person player="braston satele" race="UNK" position="LB">satele</person> ii a center who started every game of his career moved over center for his last season guard and equipment repackage when you think about especially football we do with all the injury we are at time in maui how do you spell knock yeah flex it up putting some muscle in his hustle he s got plenty of it he has he got a lot of junk in the trunk meter and 95 pounds he was a 356 at one point david county converted defensive lineman interior defensive lineman get converted to tailback and that s like trying to tackle a midsize suv lessen escalate on spinners right there 22 inch rims included second and three coming up once again they keep it on the ground ow he again well tuesday night capital on bowie kicks off on espn sun belt champs middle tennessee making the team s first ever bowl appearance taking on central michigan motor city go on espn tuesday night part of capital one bowl week also available in high definition on espn hd let s take a look at that last hit how can tackle these big full baths or tailbacks alcohol no josh beer at the pac10 all pac10 safety said i didnt know there were tailbacks that were that big on the planet third and one coming up i agree with her price mullet emotion ready close it on a road that milton bryce mullins arms for another hawaii first down at the 27 yard line he got 14 that time they moved the chains that you jones said it is the best quarterback go so far as to say he s the best football player in college football and the way he s been throwing the ball in this ball game it s hard to argue with him there troy smith is the guy that meant the most to his team that choice meant the plays he made against michigan third down conversions deserving to clearly be the heisman winner but<person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">colt brennan</person>he s going to have his day next year ohia flag down now you down at the 24yard line day vdc guys just start to kind of fall down in front of these big running backs for hawaii i dont see anybody wrapping up with arms and doing that that form tackling thing that you guys all talk about oh you got you got a break form when you deal with 300pound tailbacks holding call against hawaii here which is gonna be a big help for the sun devils but you got to allow at 2:48 the yeti lau at 2:48 he got maui ax at 295 let s be honest he s tipping more than three bills you want to get into their legs early if you can if you dont it s not a lot of fun at the second level trying to put a helmet on these guys and and when youre playing the pass a week in and week out mark jones we talked to defensive coordinators to say weve got to stop the run well defensive coordinators to go up against me hawaii we got to stop the pass and then all of a sudden you get one of these big tail backs coming downhill action shuttle passes almost like running close to in the coming downhill urchin first and 20 <person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">brennan</person> tucks it under but his block down at the 39 yard line put the suit from the backside mana tie with the tackle that s a super play by manet i an inside linebacker whose strength isnt playing in space but he had the speed to run down pulled <person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">brennan</person> from behind bennett i is the cousin of nebula the starting tailback second and 23 coming protein six minutes to go in la wa obviously a little disappointed after his fumble that set up the last arizona state touchdown watching this sequence from the sidelines wide open underneath noah <person player="jason rivers" race="UNK" position="WR">rivers</person> has been like 7eleven open 24 hours another reception for him as he closes in on 200 yards in the ball game open on christmas eve this is offensive pioneered at all the first offense going back to the 70s and allowed wide receivers to read secondaries after the snap of the football <person player="jason rivers" race="UNK" position="WR">rivers</person> a great job of getting downfield taking that in cut finding the seedgiving<person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">colt brennan</person>a nice picture methodical drive down to filled by the why here at to the darris a using up some cloth <person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">brennan</person> complete to best touchdown hawaii 21 yards for the touchdown brendan told the fans hey how about three well he s about there three more celebration penalty against the warriors that pass absolutely throws ryan mccoy the safety touchdown like conduct number seven of the offense it s just qualified from the game livan vests is done for the night the team s leading receiver out of the game with 5:16 to go so at some point i guess you have to control your exuberance you cant afford that and devon fest has been barking after every catch we mentioned that you get some of that when you come and play against hawaii best has had some welldocumented problems off the field but june jones and this team needs devon vests there s one that most dynamic receivers in the country we got over five minutes to go here this game could go into overtime you cant afford to have devon vest sitting on the bench maybe i come from a different world but im not sure i understand that whole thing where you score touchdown and you jump up and down and get excited and somehow that s hurting your opponent s feelings or belittling and degrading your opponent if you dont want to be degraded belittled then dont let him score i dont think he s getting thrown out by the game for just jumping up and down i think he said some specific things let s watch again here you know were gonna have motion here and then best is just gonna run up into the scene watch how quickly <person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">brennan</person> gets the ball in the and how accurate this ball is i mean ryan mccoy number two is just stunned i dont think mccoy is seen a quarterback has the ability of the quick release to put that ball on a receiver that quick you given a little dap to the fans im not sure the spirit of that that rule really is i think if that s what it was let s take another look he runs back well theyre throwing him out for just no way that flag came well before i they flagged him for getting into the crowd and if that s the case mark i have to agree with you and if he s barking after the play that s one thing but if he s interacting with the fans i dont think you can afford to throw it devon bassam and the crowd comes there s people watching on tv people want to see the best athletes on the field that is it s not like that s a fun bunch celebration in the end zone where it s choreographed lovely gladys knight the pits are they in it s in it s christmas eve they get behind their team they dont have a lot of the island teams to get behind it that is sad that devon vest would get thrown out if he was caught for barking if he was count thought for talking after the play that s a second unsportsmanlike conduct emily that s one thing but i dont like him getting thrown out for for getting into the crowd amen 5:16 to go the lead back up to ten points burned up i would say a little bit of clot theyre not what we call extremely significant amount of drop on that last drop begay hey at the 17th where sweet and the special teams bringing a little bit of knock as we go down for more on that penalty from heather well ive talked to the referee to get clarification and yes indeed it was for his interaction with the fans and that being the second unsportsmanlike so you guys are right and then he finished it with both hey this aint <person player="chad green" race="UNK" position="DB">green</person> bay yeah i really dont see how that s severe or egregious or how it s belittling to your opponent or what he call that the lahaina leap arizona state s got to get to work listen they come off the sidelines no huddle which is the right way to go about things down ten points what s coming from<person player="leonard peters" race="UNK" position="DB">leonard peters</person>and <person player="rudy carpenter" race="UNK" position="QB">carpenter</person> coolie there s a lot of moxie in that pocket completes the pass to mccain here at the 39 yard line arizona state has to work quickly theyre down 10 points and you have under five minutes to go there s got to be a sense of urgency in the linemen have to get up to the line of scrimmage quickly<person player="rudy carpenter" race="UNK" position="QB">rudy carpenter</person>wants to throw the ball beyond the change to keep this clock stopped nandu idiot a tailback he gets the call witty he gets the first down at the 42 yard line and speaking at the pump day that this polish football season started back in the first week of september a lot of the talk was about the block rule how the clock starts on the kickoff and when they run the clock put down your thoughts on how it s all turned down after she s gone clear a lot of the coaches dont like it i think a mirror to rule in the nfl where the clock stops in the last two minutes <person player="rudy carpenter" race="UNK" position="QB">carpenter</person> incomplete at the 30yard line intended for trice <person player="tyrice thompson" race="UNK" position="WR">thompson</person> stops the clock with 405 to go in the fourth quarter and dont forget folks coming up sportscenter after the game the nfl playoff picture troy smith how do you slow him down im not gonna say stop it but maybe just slow him down and then oneonone with kobe bryant john anderson and steve levy on sports death sportscenter immediately following the game<person player="rudy carpenter" race="UNK"

race="UNK" position="LB">adam leonard</person>and there s <person player="leonard peters" race="UNK" position="DB">peters</person> glanville press the button glanville as a defensive coordinator up ten points he s not going to play soft he s not going to play three deep what we love to call the preevent defense he s going to float with the same defensive scheme that got him this lead in the first place and if arizona state s going to make points on this drive and stay in this football game theyre gonna have to do it against keith pressure inputs bergland made its immense difference in his two years at defensive floor hawaii third and ten a defining moment for the warrior defense and they answer the challenge purcell with the sack fourth down coming up 350 to go do you punk or is it time to go for it you gotta go here i think you have to go you have your timeouts and youre down ten points i know it s for than 16 but too much time is going to come off the clock and and by the way it s dirt cutters last game i mean what do you lose here it s a bowl game i dont like this decision they punt it away and take some very auspicious bounce for arizona state down to the 5yard line 314

you know all of his team s reflected his values hard work selflessness discipline but a few of them turned his vision into a living breathing winning work of art a confluence of talent and fine tuning of sweatdrenched effort an intangible chemistry that landed him on top of the basketball world and gave us moments and memories that will last forever the championship teams of coach bob kite as he sits on the plank of history the unlv on the 28th and in mexico on january 1st as he flips to surpass dean smith with total wins so a pivotal and somewhat controversial decision by dirt cutter to punt on that last sequence on fourth down allow a back in the ball game the last time he touched the ball he fumbled awawa with both hands firmly wrapped around the ball falls at the 5 yard line maybe got 182 on the play what do you think of that well it s a tough decision to make to go ahead and punt there because you have an offense it s capable of picking up a fourth and 16 and remember the clock starts before the first down snap you have three timeouts left the clocks gonna start four times once before the first down snap and then after first second and third down so you gonna lose time off the clock here there s not going to be a timeout left for after the third down play youre really counting on getting the ball back and then recovering onside kick i think you have to take the risk inside your own 35 and go on fourth and 16 there cutter knows what comes with the job and the title of head coach the son of a coach coached by his father high school coming up learning the game he knows what the mind feels and the pitfalls are and hell move on to another position no died in hell be hired by somebody i guess relatively soon there s no doubt he s one of the beck s best x s nose offensive minds and college football i mention the organ pipeline because underneath mike bilotti at offensive coordinators like al borgess who s gone to auburn jeff tedford a cow bob toledo came close with cade mcnown their national title game appearance and then you have turk cotter those are four officers in coach extended actually back in parts the decision made to terminate his contract after the arizona victory this month brendan keeps himself nice moved almost a face mask and brendan lunging for the first down at the 19 yard line so he shows you some of his somewhat deceiving robust athletic talent 246 to go they keep possession of the football and moved the chains june jones just like clockwork talks about the intangibles of<person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">colt brennan</person>how about his mobility go ahead and run it guys he s not only going to pick up the first down here but watch him dive back in towards the field to play to keep the clock moving after they whistled the ball ready for the snap and that he s going to really make things tough on arizona state because a new set of downs arizona state still with two timeouts left both teams with a pair of timeouts remaining a la wow your insurance policy out to the 23 yard line and heather <person player="rodney cox" race="UNK" position="DB">cox</person> has more on der cutter well i talked to arizona state athletic director lisa love about her decision to fire coach cutter and she said she appreciates the work he s done over the last six years but she added you know what now were working with coach erickson his resume and championships and bcs games was the deciding factor and basically she said the whole reason were seeking a grander stage for the sun devils so in the conversation it seemed to me that ultimately the two and 19 record against ranked teams and the fact that they never won in california against pac10 teams were the deciding factors in making the coaching change erickson had their uh turn around oregon estate after consecutive seasons there s a look at his impressive resume went seven and five and then that eleven in one seed is it david for oregon state under erickson his second year theyre pretty fast start in corvallis and then two national championships at the university of miami after that it was on to the nfl he s a player s coach and his team s play with confidence he s an offensive mastermind you mentioned the two national championships and that eleven one team or oregon state they went down and absolutely trashed notre dame in the fiesta bowl right in front of the tempe faithful and and i think the people down in tempe and most importantly lisa love remember that game he is a guy that is a quickfix type coach i think he s capable of doing some things with arizona state and by the way mike price was a candidate hailed for that job mike price only a matter of time before he gets a big job one of the the best second down and six to go for hawaii they storm back in the third quarter with three touchdowns as<person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">colt brennan</person>was white hot by the yard behind the line of scrimmage as the clock approaches two minutes on there s a timeout called by arizona state it looks like here that s their last allow us to take some hits but more importantly he gives out more than he takes mike tirico has more on the upcoming game on monday night football they are gonna surprise nfl stories of 2006 chad pennington and the new york jets still in the afc playoff chase they visit jason taylor and the miami dolphins on christmas night at 8:30 eastern on espn s monday night football you know what i think about dolphins jets i think about come back i think about dan marino the fake spike touchdown and i think about that comeback when jason taylor looked into the camera and said it s over baby waking up to the by miami herald the next morning i found out otherwise vinny vinny testaverde had other thoughts wayne prevent with a huge game that night did sports sportscenter sorry david coming up next and look at the clock 212 left third down play hawaii and then keep the ball on the ground here you never know with june jones down the sideline but safe to say theyre gonna keep the ball on the ground if arizona state can stop hawaii here there s going to be about a minute and a half left when arizona state gets the ball back even if they score theyre gonna have to get an onside kick and theyre going back one more time that s the reason i think to go on fourth and 16 because then you dont have to rely on recovering an onside kick what a day for a quarterback<person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">colt brennan</person>a careerhigh 480 yards passing blitz off the edge and <person player="jason rivers" race="UNK" position="WR">rivers</person> <person player="jason rivers" race="UNK" position="WR">rivers</person> is thinking about a hostile if you dont go ball jason rumors you better ask somebody touchdown hawaii 79 yards and a bolt across the hawaiian plane this one is pretty much done now as rumors made sure that he stayed away from those adoring fans there though establishing of contact no flags on the play for celebration as <person player="davone bess" race="nonwhite" position="WR">bess</person> gives him a little time well for those of you in the eastern time zone who are still up and we hope that you are again seen<person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">colt brennan</person>and this prolifically offense you had to wait a little while david they have to wait after 30 pairs 30 minutes of football but you certainly saw what they can do here in the second half erupted with 38 points <person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">brennan</person> but alltime bull record about 560 cards a school record in addition to five touchdowns look at coach on the other side of the field that s as advertised it this is going to be a slant by <person player="jason rivers" race="UNK" position="WR">rivers</person> here and<person player="justin tryon" race="nonwhite" position="DB">justin tryon</person>cannot play as soft as he did the games on the line here you cant give up a first down and then not much of an effort by <person player="justin tryon" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tryon</person> to make the tackle i was not impressed by <person player="justin tryon" race="nonwhite" position="DB">justin</person> trion s effort there and <person player="jason rivers" race="UNK" position="WR">rivers</person> having himself at night take one more look at this in real speed and speaking of speed <person player="jason rivers" race="UNK" position="WR">rivers</person> a former state track champion the turbo kicked in about right here it was thinking six and about a hundred and eighteen teams in the country that would run the ball in that situation on third nine up ten points being safe with the football not june jones like i said you never know what he s going to spring on here he trusts court <person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">brennan</person> to put the ball up to be secure with the football and that was one of the best slam throws ive seen at the college level all year his steering record 308 yards by<person player="jason rivers" race="UNK" position="WR">jason rivers</person>brennan he s been on point the closest ive come the flapping in the press box watching<person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">colt brennan</person>the performance of this offense you just have to appreciate the precision and the execution what a year for bolt <person player="colt brennan" race="UNK" position="QB">brennan</person> and i think it s safe to say mark jones he may be the favorite and the heisman boating going in the next year if he comes back this is a great platform and a good time

like and he s given some props to meet allowing his tail contact number for the return team mr goal first down there is ryan was the perpetrator of the penalty that time obviously you can understand his frustration<person player="jason rivers" race="UNK" position="WR">jason rivers</person>with 308 receiving arms today alltime single game record high school history well i had a chance to win full

setting records at all i mean this is just a real surreal and im here im just glad im here and im fine i got to represent the wine we got the win and that s what was all about the record comes with five touchdown passes in the second half after a slow first start and second the first half what did you do to flip the switch man we just you know we just weathered the storm and there were some things that happened in the first half that is today going away and you know we did get ourself gonna get frustrated we kept the positive momentum and we just said our time will come and once it did now we just capitalized and kept it coming after you set the record fans started yelling one more cult i saw you turn around them and say how about three more how did you keep your promise i dont know man i just i knew once we got that one touchdown that all the butterflies they kind of the pressure would kind of break down and then we could go up there and be ourselves and once we scored once i knew because to keep scoring and you know just that s how we do i hate to flip the switch but now to the million dollar question or maybe that s the multi million dollar question will you return to
