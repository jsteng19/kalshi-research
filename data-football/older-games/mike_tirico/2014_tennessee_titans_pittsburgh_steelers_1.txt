well great defensive pressure really forcing the tempo for both sides tonight you know what you dont see there s no more in this rivalry right because they dont play each other as much but back in the old afc north this is what these rivalries look like you just never know which way the games is going to go always close games one of the things that impressed me the most is how tend to see how hardhitting tennessee s defense is right now and how much theyre blitzing pittsburgh right now you know you would think they would do the opposite and sitting zone but that s what a lot of those screens the <person player="antonio brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">antonio brown</person> comes open its things so the way theyre challenging them tonight is really this really interesting to

to the line of scrimmage quickly and crying diagnose what it s going to be bleeding great well turn the corner or 10 if you have a back injury and this has been challenged i believe by ken whisenhunt kenneth e is challenging the ruling of the field of incomplete pass if l have it or not that s his question theyll take a look at it the first aspect of the catch is firm grip control and i dont think that ever happened and tennessee question that does they challenge <person player="brad wing" race="white" position="P">brad</person> alan has taken a look at it a firm grip and control the ball then get the two feet down with time to perform an act common to the game able to do something with it all those criterias being a catch after reviewing the play the ruling of an incomplete pass is
