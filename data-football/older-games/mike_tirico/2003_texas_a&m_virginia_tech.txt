============================================================

&gt;&gt; mike: isabel is ringing in blacksburg the hurricane battering the virginia coast is having an impact 300 miles west at the virginia tech campus still, the hokie faithful are here to support their team in a top 20 showdown! virginia tech quarterback<person player="bryan randall" race="UNK" position="QB">bryan randall</person>hears all of the calls from mike vicks brother his response is a near perfect summer <person player="reggie mcneal" race="UNK" position="QB">reggie</person> mcneal, tonight, he tries to be number eight beat number eight on the road with rain and wind whipping, west virginia, we welcome you to college football thursday a battle of the top 20 teams both undefeated number 20, texas a&amp;m and number eight, virginia tech the headline story will be the weather tonight weve had close to an inch of rain in blacksburg and another couple of inches on the way winds already gusting to 30 miles per hour could get some 40 miles per hour when all is said and done with that backdrop, welcome to the start of college football weekend and one of the matchups, amongst top 25 teams obviously, the weather is the story if youve watched any weather today, youve seen the pictures from virginia beach, virginia where the storm came ashore thats 325 miles from here, but the impact, the western fringe of hurricane isabel has been felt starting around 3:00 in the afternoon here in blacksburg i think the worst of the weather is going to come here after midnight and talking to the forecasters just a few minutes ago, but still the weather will have a significant impact on this game there were discussions on whether this game should be played and once texas a&amp;m got here yesterday and no danger with the fans in the stands and on the road tonight, the decision to go forward was made impact on the field, lets check in the elements with dr jerry punch &gt;&gt; jerry: despite four hours of incessant rain, the field is in quite good shaped 22 drains beneath this grass with vacuum system that can pull water out of this as i feel the grass, it feels relatively dry right now, so foot wag not a problem during warmups, but what was a problem was the swirling wind if you kick a field goal in between the swirls, it will go straight but if a wind gust catches it, it can move left or right foot up to seven yards the wind last year created such a problem neither team could throw the football the history in lane stadium is the wind could make the passing game a nonentity &gt;&gt; stay dry down there, doc impact of the weathers, guys? lee and kirk? &gt;&gt; lee: equalize &gt;&gt; kirk: i think secure the football abruptly and othwise watch the center quarterback exchange that will be big &gt;&gt; mike: we talk about the wind and passing game but that is a significant part of the football you picked virginia tech to be in the champion at the start of the season it0 so far a lot of people thought mike vis brother, marcus, would be the quarterback by now and<person player="bryan randall" race="UNK" position="QB">bryan randall</person>hasnt screwed it up and been the star of the season &gt;&gt; kirk: randalls attitude throughout this potential controversy he has continued to work and become a better player sometimes guys say that but you really wonder if they understand the impact he has gone out and worked very, very hard last year as a firsttime starter, he stepped into a very difficult situation and played fllessly, with the exception of the turnovers 19 turnovers last year he worked hard in the off season with his quarterback coach, kevin rogers and this year, he has not turned the ball over yet in two football games and thats going to be the key tonight can he maintain that effort to hold on to the football and secure it &gt;&gt; mike: down south in alabama, everybody knows that dennis franchione was with the crimson tied and left controversially to go to texas a&amp;m they are 20 and beat a good utah team and have a guy that can make plays under center &gt;&gt; lee: the texas a&amp;m quarterback, the worst nightmare first start on the road, a hurricane, a wet ball, winds, a hostile environment everything goes against this guy when he walked in the room the other day, what did i say to you? what a goodlooking athlete this guy is &gt;&gt; mike: he beat oklahoma &gt;&gt; kirk: he beat oklahoma &gt;&gt; mike: we should have an interesting game tonight the weather will be a significant factor, but the fans rece davis, have shown out in strong numbers now set the table for a pretty good weekend rece? &gt;&gt; rece: no question about that, mike they always turn out in blacksburg, no matter what the elements trev alberts and mark may with me chris fowler getting on the road early heading to baton rouge and lsu and georgia this weekend and wanted to make sure he got by hurricane isabel it has hit land now, hurricane isabel and impacted to some degree, duke and north carolina north carolina state among the teams that moved practice earlier in the day west virginia is keeping a close eye on the weather rich rodriguez saying potentially the mountaineers could bust to their game in maryland to avoid the worst part of the weather but the major impact on the game is what were going to see tonight a lot of rain some places and tom obrien says two hurricanes at boston college, headed my way im worried about the hurricanes coming in saturday night, miami unranked teams knocking off top 25 squads is a story line but this week, weve got matchups within the top 25 that carry a great deal of significance and well get it all started off you see the two battles in the sec michigan trying to followup that big win over notre dame by going to oregon another pac10big 10 battle going on there and well get it cranked up tonight virginia tech and texas a&amp;m 111, texas a&amp;m, thursday night games on espn the only loss, the hurricane goal, naturally, back in 1998 &gt;&gt; mark: watch their defense be the key of the game to get up the field to try to disrupt the offense of virginia tech and make jones make cuts in the back field and what is key in this game because o sliply conditions and slippery conditions and both teams will try to run the football but johns is jones is coming off two wrist injuries i tell go for the football, rake it out and create turnovers for this football game and you can win &gt;&gt; trev: if you look at this offense, virginia tech, all they want to do is get in their regular formation two wide receivers, a tight end and two backs all theyre going to do is look at texas a&amp;m and see how they defend it if they help stop the run, good on the outside to go mantoman with wilfork but then if you say, look, we got to cover the wide receivers, we only have seven guys in the box, thats when<person player="kevin jones" race="UNK" position="RB">kevin jones</person>goes nuts running the football the key to this game is for texas a&amp;m is to get varks tech out of their regular formation what i mean is they have to get them in one back formations and in predictable situations where they can bring pressure and double on the outside and do a job of shutting down that run &gt;&gt; rece: the elements were going to see tonight sort of plays right into the hands of that virginia tech offensive line they like to get down and dirty &gt;&gt; trev: they do and the best center in all of college football and thats<person player="jake grove" race="UNK" position="OL">jake grove</person>he been called one of the meanest, nastiest players in all of college football i had a chance to go to his home and find out just what makes ole<person player="jake grove" race="UNK" position="OL">jake grove</person>a tough football player ♪♪ ♪ well life on the farm kind of laid back ♪ early to rise early in the sack ♪ ♪♪ &gt;&gt;

kirk: we saw in warmups going from the right to the left, the ball just dies i dont think he hit it real good but, at the same time, the wind is going going to have a big impact on this game going righttoleft &gt;&gt;

kirk: hes making much better decisions this year in the first couple of games hes very poised here is another guy that weve seen over time, the game has slowed down hes starting to see the defense, looking into the defenses eyes and making the right read as opposed to sometimes predetermining or relying on his great athletic ability he is now a threat thats made this offense more balanced &gt;&gt; mike: four receivers, wind at their back jones is in the slot near side handoff to hughes the backup tail back in that twoback set, they put two good runners and theyre knocking on the door of a first down scotts de cane made the tackle jones can break the games in back field <person player="keith willis" race="UNK" position="TE">willis</person> is an improving tight end and<person player="richard johnson" race="UNK" position="WR">richard johnson</person>has to be a step up for this team and what about the star receiver, number 19? &gt;&gt; lee:<person player="ernest wilford" race="UNK" position="WR">ernest wilford</person>tall and excellent athlete they will use his 64" height to catch a pass in the end zone and hell catch it a great athlete &gt;&gt; mike: impressive <person player="jacob young" race="UNK" position="P">young</person> man as well esalick leads the way jones tries the right side and check the mark to see if he got a first down scotts de cane, 57, is in for jared morris, who is a veteran linebacker who busted up his knee and the fifth year senior is done for the rest of the season this former walkon, the guy was the 12th man in the texas a&amp;m tradition as 12th man, he earned that three times as a walkon and scholarship player now and starting middle linebacker for the aggies at number 18 well check the measurement here on that third down run what do you want to do lee? &gt;&gt; lee: go for it a quarterback sneak to the right side because they got nice sides over there, 300pounders i think id go with a quarterback sneak i would not take the ball back off the line of scrimmage because there might be a penalty &gt;&gt; mike: theyll be runningehind this offensive line you saw trev alberts visit with<person player="jake grove" race="UNK" position="OL">jake grove</person>on the farm the offensive coordinator, <person player="brian patrick" race="UNK" position="DL">brian</person> stinespring likes the way theyre going they fill up the back field<person player="jeff king" race="UNK" position="TE">jeff king</person>is back there with the full back, esalick jones a late start but a good finish! jones keeps going first and goal at the 1! they almost had it for a loss of two, now its first and goal and jones threw a shoe &gt;&gt; kirk: you can get a feel for the quickness a simple power play fourth and a few feet and hes able to avoid a defender the guy on the corner came crashing down but jones had enough wiggle and quickness and there u see the power he went through two or three tackles and almost took that all the way to the end zone &gt;&gt; mike: hes still working on his shoe he put that baby on hes smelling the end zone! &gt;&gt; lee: a little mud on your feet &gt;&gt; mike: hes got a shoe and the ball and hes got six! touchdown! &gt;&gt; lee: we had a conversation today and <person player="john kirk" race="UNK" position="OL">kirk</person> and i told him, whatever you want to do, you want to have the win at your wind at your back to start the football game no matter what i dont care who gets the ball or wins the toss, get the wind and put them to sleep early &gt;&gt; mark: the drive for the extra point is good 37th extra point drive of his career the wind and pick up fourth and one and jones drags them to the 1 the shoe comes off, slips it back on and slips into the corner of the end zone [ crowd clamoring &gt;&gt; mike: short field, quick work for the hokies on top 70 jones runs it in for the touchdown &gt;&gt; lee: the key was number 43, <person player="doug easlick" race="UNK" position="RB">doug</person> easlick, the full back watch him as he cuts down to outside defender right here and billy hite, the running back coach, told us they went to nebraska to find out what does that ful back need to do and they said thats the number one block he needs to make he made a great block &gt;&gt; kirk: they say <person player="doug easlick" race="UNK" position="RB">easlick</person> is the best one theyve been around as far as perimeter blocking and getting out there on linebackers and space &gt;&gt; mike: explosive seed taken out to the 34 yard line ball came out they jump around on it was anybody down? yeah, he was down one of the officials from the far side coming in to say he was down by the james anderson tackle no fumble so into the wind for texas a&amp;m will take over our anameter is located in the left corner of the stadium, about 20 feet high the goal post is 30 feet ho high we put it there because thats where youre going to see the ball somewhere in there, the kick is up high and down low passing seven or eight feet up in the air its not going to have the same reading as you see at the top of the stadium with the flag for example, first down run is taking taken by<person player="keith joseph" race="UNK" position="RB">keith joseph</person>make it six for the junior out of the houston right now, t wind on the meets at that level is under 10 miles per hour you look at the flags at the top of the stadium and it is well over the 20 miles per hour and, lee, you mentioned, you didnt like the strategy at the start of the game by texas a&amp;m &gt;&gt; lee: you always take the wind to your back stay in the game in the first quarter and then let nature take its course after that you dt want to get blown out early, especially away from home &gt;&gt; mike: second down for<person player="reggie mcneal" race="UNK" position="QB">reggie mcneal</person>and three his first throw attempt will be a run and hell get about a yard and a half he pulled mccall <person player="mikal baaqee" race="UNK" position="LB">baaqee</person> the guys on the end, <person player="cols colas" race="UNK" position="DL">colas</person> and <person player="nathaniel adibi" race="UNK" position="DL">adibi</person> the lewis brothers, kevin and jonathan, they play in the middle &gt;&gt;

mike: third and one the quarterback has a first down at the 48 yard line<person player="michael crawford" race="UNK" position="DB">michael crawford</person>came up from the rover spot to make the stop lets talk about the virginia tech defense the back seven <person player="vegas robinson" race="UNK" position="LB">vegas</person> robinson, when he got hurt, they werent as good <person player="brandon manning" race="UNK" position="LB">manning</person> at the linebacker position and <person player="mikal baaqee" race="UNK" position="LB">baaqee</person> wiles is good on the corner as well, but this is a key player right there &gt;&gt; kirk:<person player="jimmy williams" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jimmy williams</person>is the difference maker in this defense he can be an intimidating force that they have to have this year &gt;&gt; mike: first down first toss is caught by van zant out to the 32 yard line tim van zant, a senior, picks up 19 yards he was put on scholarship during this off <person player="dustin long" race="UNK" position="QB">long</person> week by dennis franchione and hes paying dividends here tonight &gt;&gt;

kirk: what a&amp;m is trying to do right now is respecting this virginia tech defense is playing with a lot of emotion they have<person player="reggie mcneal" race="UNK" position="QB">reggie mcneal</person>out back in the shot gun and getting rid of the football as quickly as possible to respect that rush and trying to get virginia tech more back on their heels to lose some of that aggressiveness &gt;&gt; lee: virginia techs defensive coordinator, foster, told us in the wind and rain, they dont blitz as much because they dont want man forman coverage and have a defensive back slip and give them a touchdown &gt;&gt; mikon the pattern and this pass is ruled a casho terrance <person player="terrence murphy" race="UNK" position="WR">murphy</person> two yards shy of a first down third and a couple coming up murphy, a junior out of tyler, texas &gt;&gt; kirk:<person player="deangelo hall" race="nonwhite" position="DB">deangelo hall</person>giving about a 10yard cushion there theyre in the shot gun as soon as youre the quarterback, you get the football, adjust to your feet and pick a side and make a throw and take seven or eight yards gives you a much better chance two and three than third and <person player="dustin long" race="UNK" position="QB">long</person> &gt;&gt; lee: before the play is run, id go for fourth down against this wind before id try a field goal i think so &gt;&gt; mike: germany, second tight end in motion <person player="reggie mcneal" race="UNK" position="QB">mcneal</person> keeping turned it up and picks up a first down there you see a little bit why <person player="reggie mcneal" race="UNK" position="QB">mcneal</person> was able to win the quarterback job from<person player="dustin long" race="UNK" position="QB">dustin long</person>and did a pretty good job last year <person player="reggie mcneal" race="UNK" position="QB">mcneal</person> has that extra dimension &gt;&gt; kirk: the quarterback is going to read the read <person player="cols colas" race="UNK" position="DL">colas</person> came down enough for <person player="reggie mcneal" race="UNK" position="QB">mcneal</person> to feel he could pull it and beat it to the edge and pick up the three yards in the first down a kind of a gray area there, but you can see <person player="reggie mcneal" race="UNK" position="QB">mcneal</person> trusts his athletic ability and speed to pick up that first down &gt;&gt; mike:<person player="courtney lewis" race="UNK" position="RB">courtney lewis</person>is in the game as tail back has the speed to get outside, but that varks techs swarming defense snows him under for a loss of maybe a half yard<person player="vegas robinson" race="UNK" position="LB">vegas robinson</person>tops the pile and<person player="michael crawford" race="UNK" position="DB">michael crawford</person>there as well on the stop<person player="courtney lewis" race="UNK" position="RB">courtney lewis</person>is a player who has them believing that maybe we can get a thousand yard back in kyle field in college station they havent had one in about five years but in his first two games, lewis has put up numbers that has opened eyes &gt;&gt; lee: hes averaging six yards per carry which is the secret to making a thousand yards &gt;&gt; mike: red shirt freshman out of madison high school in houston play nine of the drive is lewis bounces off a couple of tackles hes a good tackling, speedy virginia tech defense<person player="vegas robinson" race="UNK" position="LB">vegas robinson</person>started it and<person player="jonathan lewis" race="UNK" position="DL">jonathan lewis</person>finishes it up &gt;&gt; kirk: as soon as they see lewis in the game, as a full back, the 21 set where you have two backs in there, virginia tech and foster, its like lights go off inside those helmets this see two backs and know a good chance that lewis is going to get the football and crowding the line of scrimmage every time there are two backs &gt;&gt; lee: bud loves the best this situation third and <person player="dustin long" race="UNK" position="QB">long</person> make some big plays on the virginia tech defense &gt;&gt; me: going into the student section and the wind mcneal, everybody covered huhuh not these guys theyre too fast flag came down they grabbed his face mask lets see if its 5 or 15 <person player="reggie mcneal" race="UNK" position="QB">mcneal</person> was trying to elude &gt;&gt; referee: personal foul grabbing the face mask on the defense penalty will be enforced from the previous spot first down &gt;&gt; mike: so a big break for texas a&amp;m keeps the drive alive &gt;&gt; lee: i tell you why this is a 15yard penalty, mike you can see the helmet turn en he takes a helmet d it turns, kirk, they usually give them 15 yards if he just slaps at them, its five &gt;&gt; kirk: plus, once his hand grabbed on, its 15 you got to let go of that as soon as you feel it &gt;&gt; mike: <person player="cols colas" race="UNK" position="DL">colas</person> comes to the sideline after picking up the flag get that hand worked on first and goal the aggies going for a tying touchdown derrick farmer, the full back, is now at the tail <person player="derek farmer" race="UNK" position="RB">farmer</person> has it and they have him <person player="michael crawford" race="UNK" position="DB">crawford</person> in there, along with mccall to back him &gt;&gt; kirk: texas has had the big play ability with their offense but not sustained drives only twice out of 2 drives have they had longer than three minutes and now theyre over five minutes here on this pivotal drive early in this game &gt;&gt; mike: is youth a part of that? &gt;&gt; kirk: i think youth and a new system youre break engine a new offensive line and new quarterback and i think learning that aadapting that has a lot to do with them theyll get better &gt;&gt; mike: good run for lewis until he meets that maroon front<person player="michael crawford" race="UNK" position="DB">michael crawford</person>has been involved in four tackles already on this drive &gt;&gt;

kirk: youre going to see him roll at the top &gt;&gt; lee: yeah or boot &gt;&gt; mike: farmer, tail back <person player="terrence murphy" race="UNK" position="WR">murphy</person> in motion a little time, but nothing open from the 5 yard line from here, its a 22yard field goal into the wind we saw kicks made into the wind in pregame warmups and well see what <person player="todd pegram" race="UNK" position="K">todd</person> pegram, the sophomore, can come on and do from short range &gt;&gt; kirk: every year, we pull out the footage that ball just dives up into the air we saw a few of those in the warmups &gt;&gt; lee: yeah remember, virginia tech is real famous for blocking kicks &gt;&gt; mike: into the student section that looks like the aggie section! from 22 yards out good enough a very impressive drive it started with a good kick return, but <person player="reggie mcneal" race="UNK" position="QB">mcneal</person> made some big plays and 7:30 denni captioning provided by espn, inc &gt;&gt;

lee: how about the field that dr jerry punch talked about? &gt;&gt; mike: <person player="cody scates" race="UNK" position="P">cody</person> scates, good kickoff into the wind a line drive and all the wayack to the goal line for <person player="cedric humes" race="UNK" position="RB">cedric</person> hughes who has some real estate to work with! and is taken down at the 30 special teams tackle from back up defensive back jean taye buhl <person player="bryan randall" race="UNK" position="QB">bryan</person> randalcf &gt;&gt; mike: some of the strong wind gusts coming through here virginia tech has its wind to its back for the remaining of the second quarter<person player="reggie mcneal" race="UNK" position="QB">reggie mcneal</person>did a nice job into the wind a very impressive 7:30 play<person player="bryan randall" race="UNK" position="QB">bryan randall</person>from his own 30 a junior from williamsburg, virginia to throw for the first time <person player="doug easlick" race="UNK" position="RB">easlick</person> caught it and he picks up about five yards lee, youve assessed both teams give me the advantage coming in &gt;&gt; lee: i studied a week at texas tech one thing about texas a&amp;m, theyve had 22 yards running, 30 yards passing and my team that had the balance, virginia tech 28 yards rushing and zipo passing see how much i know? &gt;&gt; kirk: you may end up being right well come back and visit that &gt;&gt; mike: second and five four receivers out of the gun &gt;&gt; kirk: something new from virginia tech, this good &gt;&gt; mike: whistles blow some motion up front perhaps for the hokies &gt;&gt;

mike: you could argue <person player="james miller" race="UNK" position="OL">miller</person> moved on the fourth down run earlier as well &gt;&gt; kirk: a little bit of a head start on that power play &gt;&gt; mike: no saks for the a&amp;m defensive line smith may be the best of the bunch but three sophomores start for texas a&amp;m &gt;&gt; kirk: theyre inspearsed you think about their defense over the last 25 to 20 years, you think of big defensive linemen its going to take them a little time to recruit here, but i think theyre better players than what theyve shown the first couple of games &gt;&gt; mike: pass caught by<person player="richard johnson" race="UNK" position="WR">richard johnson</person>four yards shy of a first down third and four coming up the linebackers will have to make some decisions this is a key group tonight because they are so inexperienced here <person player="everett smith" race="UNK" position="LB">everett</person> smith, i stoled you about stickane, the walkon and warren in there as well meantime, in the secondary, <person player="sean weston" race="UNK" position="DB">weston</person> and jones on the corner and<person player="ronald jones" race="UNK" position="DB">ronald jones</person>the strong safety and saxson <person player="jaxson appel" race="UNK" position="DB">appel</person> &gt;&gt; kirk: hes had opportunities already in the early going already &gt;&gt; mike: taking a peak in the back field drops in coverage and throws complete but shy of the first down look at that mark there? &gt;&gt; kirk: its going to be five &gt;&gt; mike:<person player="richard johnson" race="UNK" position="WR">richard johnson</person>caught it<person player="scott stickane" race="UNK" position="LB">scott stickane</person>hit him the aggie coaches are barking at the officials as he has enough for the first down i thought he was two yards shy of the 40! &gt;&gt; kirk: last year, virginia tech, one dimensional offense practicallying breaking in a new quarterback and this year, they feel they have experience and receiver and quarterback will allow them to throw the football just as effectively as they can run it &gt;&gt; mike: <person player="justin hamilton" race="UNK" position="WR">hamilton</person> is in the game theres movement up front and pointing a&amp;m first or virginia tech? &gt;&gt; referee: disconcerting signals on the defense fiveyard penalty &gt;&gt; mike: there you go, lees? &gt;&gt; lee: i havent heard that in a <person player="dustin long" race="UNK" position="QB">long</person> time it means your count is down, down the defense says down, down, it sounds like it exactly &gt;&gt; mike: should we listen? &gt;&gt; kirk: you saw it right there &gt;&gt; lee: yeah &gt;&gt; kirk: you can see <person player="johnny jolly" race="UNK" position="DL">johnny</person> jolly, you can see his shoulders actually flex &gt;&gt; mike: some poor person who is doing the closed captioning during this game is going what did corso say? first and five stay in there to get the snap and picks up four yards<person player="jaxson appel" race="UNK" position="DB">jaxson appel</person>was up there on the spot &gt;&gt; jerry: he is a sophomore and no doubt a leader on this aggie defense he broke a bone in the middle of his left hand, did not come out of the football game, played the rest of the football game and had a pin inserted in the metacarpal that sunday and playing with a soft cast over that left hand has it operated on he has stitches all the way from the back of his wrist, to the middle of his knuckle that is one tough gie &gt;&gt; mike: texas football spitting dirt on it lets go! second and one they run with it with jones who has the first down across mid field from the 47 yard line <person player="jaxson appel" race="UNK" position="DB">appel</person> has a broken hand and stick is his nose in there theyll mark it across mid field and should take us to the end of the opening quarter &gt;&gt; lee: can you guys believe it? rain, sleet, snow? everything! well, no, no &gt;&gt; kirk: hurricane? &gt;&gt; lee: no turnovers amazing &gt;&gt; mike: and very few vacancies the tremendous fans here in blacksburg, just as wed see if we were in college station at kyle field, so loyal and supportive of their team after 15 minutes at virginia tech, the home team leads the aggies by four ♪♪ &gt;&gt; mike: all set for quarter number two in the land of the gobblers, the hokies a bunch of nicknames it is weird to see them in all maroon and a&amp;m in all white here tonight first and ten, virginia tech from the 47 ndalls fourth throw the full back kind of night, too <person player="doug easlick" race="UNK" position="RB">easlick</person> with the catch first down a gain of 14 for the senior out of new jersey &gt;&gt; kirk:<person player="doug easlick" race="UNK" position="RB">doug easlick</person>is known as a bigtime blocker and prototype blocker in this system because thats what hes usually out there to do they sprinkle in enough of the full back out in the flat and give him a dive occasionally just enough to keep him happy to get him back in there and line up on an isolation or a big power block against the linebacker &gt;&gt; mike: reminder, virginia tech is going into the wind, about eight, ten feet high and under 10 miles per hour up a little bit higher, its 20 miles per hour with higher gusts through the night<person player="kevin jones" race="UNK" position="RB">kevin jones</person>breaks free! no wind bogging him down there first and ten<person player="jaxson appel" race="UNK" position="DB">jaxson appel</person>made a saving tackle! &gt;&gt; lee: the left side of the offensive line, <person player="jimmy martin" race="UNK" position="OL">martin</person> and <person player="jacob gibson" race="UNK" position="OL">gibson</person> and in the center, <person player="jake grove" race="UNK" position="OL">grove</person> they all set up, kirk, that time like it was going to be a pass and blocked out and jones is ready its that play you talk about all of the time when everybody blocks one way and reads it the other way &gt;&gt; kirk: designed to cut back i love the formation and diversification with this offense virginia tech motioning a guy around for a reverse and handing the football off so many different ways they can attack &gt;&gt; mike: jones got the corner and gets it down to the 11 yard line you know,, kirk, theyre table to do more of that formation stuff because they have a quarterback with some experience and the ability to be a threat in both run and pass game &gt;&gt; kirk: i think thats the biggest difference this year with virginia tech a lot of the people nationally are talking about marcus vick<person player="bryan randall" race="UNK" position="QB">bryan randall</person>is the leader of his offense its his offense vicks going to get his opportunities but randalls experience last year and hard work that he put in in the off season leading up to this year and the great receivers that they have at virginia tech, youre going to see a lot of different window dressing for virginia techs offense &gt;&gt; mike: second and four jones dances in the hole and <person player="johnny jolly" race="UNK" position="DL">johnny</person> jolly, the sophomore out of forest brook high school in shoes houston, made the tackle &gt;&gt; lee: in our meeting yesterday, remember the coaches said the two most competitive guys he can they are they can remember is <person player="michael crawford" race="UNK" position="DB">michael</person> <person player="marcus vick" race="UNK" position="QB">vick</person> and<person player="bryan randall" race="UNK" position="QB">bryan randall</person>now, that was one heck of a compliment &gt;&gt; mike: thats why<person player="marcus vick" race="UNK" position="QB">marcus vick</person>stays on the bench the competitiveness of his brother they see in <person player="bryan randall" race="UNK" position="QB">randall</person> plus the performance that has gone light years ahead of him &gt;&gt; kirk: <person player="bryan randall" race="UNK" position="QB">randall</person> completing 73% of his passes coming no ntonight and without any interceptions and thats the thing that really hurt him last year &gt;&gt; mike: third and three <person player="richard johnson" race="UNK" position="WR">johnson</person> in motion and wide open! the tight end! touchdown, <person player="jeff king" race="UNK" position="TE">jeff</person> king! penalty marker comes down late and well check it now &gt;&gt; referee: there was unsportsman like conduct on virginia tech &gt;&gt; mike: they will talk to texas a&amp;m remember, this placement try and subsequent kickoff, both will occur into the wind given the rule changes this year, it could be a more penal situation &gt;&gt; referee: the penalty forced on the try 15 yards &gt;&gt; mike: thus, the extra point try will become at the line of scrimmage as the 17 its a 34yarder there you go thats the correct move dennis franchione was telling him put it back on the kickoff so it goes into the wind and you get better field position &gt;&gt; lee: sure just a second wouldnt it have been harder for him to make this point from that farther back? i dont know if id give them a point it might be different im just saying it &gt;&gt; kirk: franchione is saying maybe the yardage hes going to get on the kickoff is more important than this one point &gt;&gt; mike: its through on the try <person player="bryan randall" race="UNK" position="QB">bryan</person> randall, we discussed his maturation, his smooth play 73% completion percentage in the first two games how about that drive? 5 for 5 mike:<person player="marcus vick" race="UNK" position="QB">marcus vick</person>los on,<person player="bryan randall" race="UNK" position="QB">bryan randall</person>has got an encouraging pat from his fellow quarterback for this play &gt;&gt; kirk: they have hurt him with a pull back out in the flat look at <person player="doug easlick" race="UNK" position="RB">easlick</person> draw two defenders and <person player="bryan randall" race="UNK" position="QB">randall</person> off of <person player="doug easlick" race="UNK" position="RB">easlick</person> and finds<person player="jeff king" race="UNK" position="TE">jeff king</person>all alone in the end zone <person player="doug easlick" race="UNK" position="RB">easlick</person> came up from the full back out to the flat twice theyve hurt them there &gt;&gt; mike: <person player="jeff king" race="UNK" position="TE">jeff</person> sutter is set to kick it off for virginia tech the kickoffs go very high just to recap the rule change this year 102, for those of you who like to keep a rule book by your tv, the penalty for a dead ball foul after a touchdown you have the option to enforce it on the try or the succeeding kickoff and dennis franchione got the attention of his players, tell the referee "we want them to kick off from the 20 into the wind, we can get the ball into the 40, 45 yard line with a halfway decent return" here is sutters kick the return will start from the 23<person player="jason carter" race="UNK" position="QB">jason carter</person>gets out to the 45 thats why he took a flag there for those of you just joining us, here is our espn gametrack tell you what happened with the high winds and rain of hurricane isabel<person player="cody scates" race="UNK" position="P">cody scates</person>15yard punt after the first possession of the game gave virginia tech a very short field and worked it 28 yards on the ground a fourth down and one, <person player="dustin long" race="UNK" position="QB">long</person> run by<person player="kevin jones" race="UNK" position="RB">kevin jones</person>set up that 1yard touchdown run and on the last drive, second possession, second touchdown and <person player="bryan randall" race="UNK" position="QB">randall</person> is very good on that drive 5 of 5 in the air guys, i thought the a&amp;m offense was good on last drive they kept it and got it down to the red zone but had to kic a field goal &gt;&gt; lee: that was against the wind &gt;&gt; mike: the wind is against their back and a lot of guys in maroon and should have been a pick and maybe a pick six for<person player="eric green" race="UNK" position="DB">eric green</person>&gt;&gt; kirk: this is what the coaches have told us about<person player="reggie mcneal" race="UNK" position="QB">reggie mcneal</person>at times, hes executing the offense perfectly and i think this has to do with his youth he felt pressure but under no circumstances do you ever just throw the ball up in the middle of four defenders<person player="eric green" race="UNK" position="DB">eric green</person>was there should have been able to make that interception he could it called a fair catch there to make the pick &gt;&gt; lee: sometimes with that wind blowing the way it is, that ball doesnt come down exactly like it looks up here &gt;&gt; kirk: right &gt;&gt; mike: germany, the tight end in motion <person player="reggie mcneal" race="UNK" position="QB">mcneal</person> is keeping the speed to get to the corner! pushed out of bounds at the 41 yard line a pickup of 14 &gt;&gt; lee: can that guy fly? <person player="reggie mcneal" race="UNK" position="QB">reggie</person> mcneal, you cant leave it maybe on a television screen but this is another gear that<person player="reggie mcneal" race="UNK" position="QB">reggie mcneal</person>has right here, he explodes and runs by the virginia tech defenders remember one thing i so said before? when he wald into the room for our meeting, i said, wow! what a goodlooking athlete he is! &gt;&gt; mike: he spent the second part of the summer working on weights after he was kept away from doing more football stuff early in the summer first down rush<person player="courtney lewis" race="UNK" position="RB">courtney lewis</person>stopped by a penalty marker and well check out the hankie &gt;&gt; referee: before the snap, false start on the offense movement in the interior line fiveyard penalty remains first down &gt;&gt; mike: to the sideline to jerry punch &gt;&gt; jerry: im here with the ad of virginia tech isabel moves to the eastern part of the state and power outages what was the deciding factor in your decision to play this game tonight? &gt;&gt; we formed a committee on campus early in the week stimulated by central administration and the fact of the matter is weve monitored the hurricane since monday morning at no time did we have any forecast that showed real or eminent danger to blacksburg and the new river valley &gt;&gt; mike: texas a&amp;m took a timeout they were trying to get it and they did get it go ahead &gt;&gt; jerry: jim, what have you done safety wise what a crowd by the way that showed up here despite the elements &gt;&gt; we estimate that we have less than 3500 noshows weve doubled our security force weve turned every light on campus to create more protection for our fans and the people on campus the committee that was formed earlier in the week was not just for this game but the safety and security of our people on our campus we have doubled the personnel who take care of the electrians and the plumbers, trying to to do everything as tightening down all of the trash cans in the parking lot &gt;&gt; jerry: you have done a great job here and the fans have done a phenomenal job here tonight thank you &gt;&gt; thank you its unbelievable and appreciate their support &gt;&gt; mike: he runs a great athletic program in talking to jim before, they studied this <person player="dustin long" race="UNK" position="QB">long</person> and hard before they decided to go ahead and play this game &gt;&gt; lee: thats why hes one of the best athletic directors in the country he does his homework it is amazing to see this many people in this kind of weather, how they got here! &gt;&gt; kirk: we were talking all day 35,000? next thing you know, you get ten minutes to kickoff and you look up in the stands and its a full house you never can get amazed with virginia tech fans because you always expect the best &gt;&gt; lee: yeah &gt;&gt; mike: the stadium has been expanded by more than 11,000 seats in the last couple years another expansion is on deck this is first and 15 after the flag and the timeout, a <person player="dustin long" race="UNK" position="QB">long</person> toss down field! nearly intercepted it falls incomplete bizarre to see two receivers running those flies down the field terrance <person player="terrence murphy" race="UNK" position="WR">murphy</person> and terrance thomas were both on the move &gt;&gt; kirk:<person player="eric green" race="UNK" position="DB">eric green</person>looked like the receiver there you might want to put some gloves on him &gt;&gt; lee: one thing for sure, the scouting report must say that that number one cant run because thats not thats got to be by design theyre going after number 1 and staying away from <person player="deangelo hall" race="nonwhite" position="DB">hall</person> who is on the other side and one of the worlds great players &gt;&gt; kirk: <person player="eric green" race="UNK" position="DB">green</person> started for virginia tech and acl last year and came back and one of their better corner covers better go back to the drawing board if they think they can attack<person player="eric green" race="UNK" position="DB">eric green</person>&gt;&gt; mike: second and 15 and whistles as the play clock is down to zero texas a&amp;m struggling a little bit &gt;&gt; referee: delay of game on the offense fiveyard penalty remain second down &gt;&gt; mike: could i come back to the question that lee brought up? kirk, when you have the wind at your back, a heavy wind, song wind like this, is it harder to put the tough on the deep ball? &gt;&gt; kirk: i think you get a feel for it as the game goes on i think a guy like <person player="reggie mcneal" race="UNK" position="QB">reggie</person> mcneal, shaking his hand yesterday, because he has large hands, i think hes comfortable of throwing the football heas a tight spirals and those quarterbacks have a larger hand and get in these kind of conditions, i dont think it affects them as much its like your golf swing adjusting to the wind you have to be able to deliver that touch on that deeper pass &gt;&gt; mike: second and 20 for the pattern they all get out of the way to <person player="reggie mcneal" race="UNK" position="QB">mcneal</person> can dance hes gotten nine of thpenalty yards back and a late flag comes flying i four of them, as a matter of fact as beyond the play, there was a lot of hooting and hollering and pushing with<person player="jason carter" race="UNK" position="QB">jason carter</person>and one of the hokies &gt;&gt; kirk:<person player="jason carter" race="UNK" position="QB">jason carter</person>is the one who is going to get caught for 15 yards &gt;&gt; referee: after the play had ended, personal foul on the offense the down count, 15yard penalty third down &gt;&gt; mike: these are big 12 officials he in the game tonight, by the way &gt;&gt; lee: there is a rule theyre talking about in college football to identify the person that makes the foul do you that in college pro football youre not supposed to do that were not supposed to do that up here and identify the guy i know, i know &gt;&gt; mike: the nonsense the college sports hypocacy that has problems in every other college sport in field hockey the <person player="jacob young" race="UNK" position="P">young</person> lady who commits obstruction, her name is called out but you dont call it out in football? its the mindlessness of an organization that needs to get their act together and get a choice &gt;&gt; lee: they dont want to do that to embarrass the football player &gt;&gt; mike: they embarrass the field hockey player &gt;&gt; lee: yeah, but nobody there watching &gt;&gt; kirk: how about the basketball player? &gt;&gt; mike: third and 26 pass is caught a dozen yards shy of the first down but terrance <person player="terrence murphy" race="UNK" position="WR">murphy</person> got it and they gain field at the 42 and kicking with the wind at their back if they choose to punt it away &gt;&gt; lee: i got to answer <person player="john kirk" race="UNK" position="OL">kirk</person> you know why? because in basketball, if you get five of those things, youre out of the game you dont get them out of the game here thats why they identify them in basketball &gt;&gt; mike: theyre going to go for this fourth and <person player="dustin long" race="UNK" position="QB">long</person> ten and keep the offense out here and try to go for it &gt;&gt; lee: hhmmm &gt;&gt; mike: back field, <person player="derek farmer" race="UNK" position="RB">farmer</person> in motion five in the pattern <person player="reggie mcneal" race="UNK" position="QB">mcneal</person> is blocked but a lot of room to run the speed to get to the line! first down at the 27 yard line! this is an athlete, get him the ball, make plays and hes made them thus far &gt;&gt; kirk: a after a little over a quarter, i think the best formation that a&amp;m has is putting <person player="reggie mcneal" race="UNK" position="QB">mcneal</person> bab in the shot gun because he has options he can feel the pass rush ferguson comes in and able to get to the outside i think he realized right away what he had a chance to do there by picking up the first down i think that was almost a desigd play to flood the zone, clear it deep and then allow him oneonone on the outside against a linebacker &gt;&gt; mike: 15 on the play hes run for 51 on the night they give it to keith joseph, 256 pounds, a big back out of houston, from lamar high school in vegas<person player="vegas robinson" race="UNK" position="LB">vegas robinson</person>bangs him down these teams played last year in college station and it was a tight game a 133 virginia tech victory but we have to remember the a&amp;m defense was a lot more stout last year than this year virginia techs offense is a little bit better as well a stretch where virginia tech beat lsu and then their defense goted banged up and lost four of their last five games here is second and nine for <person player="reggie mcneal" race="UNK" position="QB">mcneal</person> complete to van zant the guy who was a walkon when the season started, picks up a scholarship hes picked up a couple of first downs here tonight and its first and goal for the aggies here is the game we were talking about last year when<person player="bryan randall" race="UNK" position="QB">bryan randall</person>goes down to one of the best, if not the best atmosphere in the sport <person player="bryan randall" race="UNK" position="QB">randall</person> getting the start hits<person player="ernest wilford" race="UNK" position="WR">ernest wilford</person>on a big play that led to the lone touchdown, lee suggs run virginia tech took a piece of the turf from kyle field back home the aggies were reminded about that earlier this week first and goal <person player="derek farmer" race="UNK" position="RB">derek</person> farmer, the junior faces up jimmy williams, who takes him down at the 6 &gt;&gt; lee: the left guard john kirk, pulled that time and its hard for a big guy at 2399 299 pounds to pull out there and keep a good action on this field, but that was a beautiful block by kirk, who allowed the ball carrier to get to the outside i like this turf whatever it is and whatever theyre doing its wonderful &gt;&gt; kirk: its a little bit slick b youre not getting the puddles i think were getting here in the early going, seeing that the offense has an advantage because they can control their body weight much better than the defense reacting &gt;&gt; mike: the big back, joseph, pounds forward pushes the pile so well have third and goal coming up this ball is going to be down at about the 2 yard line &gt;&gt; kirk: when youre in the trempgs or running back or receiver and the weather is really becomes a factor, you know what direction youre going you know the snap count those are all things that give you a big advantage against a defense that is reacting in these conditions &gt;&gt; mike: and theyre moving it 25 plays for a&amp;m 128 yards getting five a pop on tech &gt;&gt; kirk: second drive in a row &gt;&gt; mike: van zant and leaves lewis as the lone back plenty of time on the play clock, as you see he kept it, didnt get back to the line<person player="michael crawford" race="UNK" position="DB">michael crawford</person>wouldnt let him go you want to take your points down here? &gt;&gt; lee: i would points are hard to come by tonight and the fourth quarter, if the weather gets bad your weather report, mike, said the weather is goingo get worse as the game goes on, right? id take as many points right now as i could &gt;&gt; mike: here comes <person player="todd pegram" race="UNK" position="K">pegram</person> made one into the wind from 22 picked as a true freshman last year and it hadnt happened in a decade and a half at college station from 20, its worth three and the aggies are within eight another nice <person player="dustin long" race="UNK" position="QB">long</person> drive after the good field position but they chose to take the penalty on the ]( úúxg/c back with you on college football on thursday, mike, lee, <person player="john kirk" race="UNK" position="OL">kirk</person> and doc our thursday crew is really doing a fabulous job, considering these awful weather conditions with squalls of rain, nonstop since 3:00 this afternoon wind blowing lefttorit as you watch the game tonight at times, gusts up to 30 miles per hour but considering that, guys, weve had 41 plays from scrimmage and a half dozen special teams kicks and we have not seen a turnover or a mishandled ball thus far &gt;&gt;

referee: pass interference on the defense 15 yards from the previous spot first down &gt;&gt; mike: huge penalty there &gt;&gt; lee: speak of a huge penalty <person player="cols colas" race="UNK" position="DL">colas</person> had one on third and <person player="dustin long" race="UNK" position="QB">long</person> with a face mask that led them to a touchdown this is a dangerous thing to tlement have another play like that &gt;&gt; kirk: it is dangerous but jim <person player="jimmy williams" race="nonwhite" position="DB">williams</person> came with his shoulder and good call its third and <person player="dustin long" race="UNK" position="QB">long</person> here the crowd is booing, but as the ball came close to contact,<person player="jimmy williams" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jimmy williams</person>williams came through with his shoulder and knocked it away from the receiver &gt;&gt; mike: first and ten from the 20 a lot of movement up front there flags come down hard to hear it with the crowd noise &gt;&gt; referee: on the offense movement in the line fiveyard penalty remains first down &gt;&gt; mike: lee mentioned it that penalty before on the prior drive kept the drive going and texas a&amp;m have converted enoug third downs to put two nice drives together &gt;&gt; kirk: the last drive, you can see <person player="reggie mcneal" race="UNK" position="QB">mcneal</person> settling in and the offense sieve line is settling in there is plenty of skill for the aggies the key this year is can <person player="reggie mcneal" race="UNK" position="QB">mcneal</person> continue to develop this environment with a crowd and the weather? so far, that offensive line and their quarterback doing a great job &gt;&gt; mike:<person player="keith joseph" race="UNK" position="RB">keith joseph</person>and<person player="courtney lewis" race="UNK" position="RB">courtney lewis</person>join him in the back field and lead the way mcnaturally couldnt get there and thought about throwing and lucky enough to bring it down is that<person player="michael crawford" race="UNK" position="DB">michael crawford</person>again? seven tackles for a guy whos story is light enriching story college ftball college ftball last year before the pittsburgh game, this <person player="jacob young" race="UNK" position="P">young</person> man had a biopsy and they found that he had lymphoma he missed the week and had testing going back and forth and played the last three weeks another test in january showed hes cancerfree and come back this year to be a big factor and already in the first half, has seven tackles a <person player="jacob young" race="UNK" position="P">young</person> man this team rallied around while they were losing game, the teammates watched him successfully battle and get his health back and hes an inspiration to this tech team to van zant, its complete and hes taken down 13yard gain and third and four coming up for a&amp;m &gt;&gt; kirk: second and on <person player="dustin long" race="UNK" position="QB">long</person> look at the distance between wiles and the wide receiver van zant hes giving him 15 yards and backing out look at the throw there once <person player="michael crawford" race="UNK" position="DB">crawford</person> went to the outside to take the back, it was a nice throwing alley because the corner is bailing out and now an opportunity on third and four to pick up the first down &gt;&gt; lee: bud foster told us in our meeting when it rains like this, he plays a lot of zone i dont know why he knows what hes doing a heck of a defensive coordinator &gt;&gt; mike: there is the the wind story as ta&amp;m works with the wind at its back the meter down right about the height of where the playing field ends, the middle of the goal posts it doesnt tell the story we often see covering golf, its the wind up at 50, 75, a hundred feet that gets measured when you take wind measurements, especially for a hurricane were just getting the western fringe of isabel third and four van zant again first down to the 34 yard line i guess that scholarship offer to him was a good choice &gt;&gt; lee: you got to give the offensive coordinator les kansas koenning credit here they have good offensive balance for a football team thats famous for running les is calling a very good ball game upstairs &gt;&gt; kirk: has a quarterback light right now that is not intimidated by this atmosphere at all impressed with <person player="reggie mcneal" race="UNK" position="QB">mcneal</person> &gt;&gt; mike: lewis is the lone back hey it finds a bit of an opening and you see a little bit of his escape ability<person player="vegas robinson" race="UNK" position="LB">vegas robinson</person>pulled him down after a gain of eight second and two 32 plays, a&amp;m 21 on the ground and controlling this game right now &gt;&gt; kirk: foster emphasized earlier in the season they are were 90 and lost to this stadium in pittsburgh look at the yards allowed rushing when you think of bud fosters again, you dont think of the following numbers compared at 228 in the previous eight games that the difference with this defense and, right now, thats hurting them again tonight &gt;&gt; mike: look at mcneals speed he beat everybody around the corner first down and out of bounds at the 43 yard line <person player="reggie mcneal" race="UNK" position="QB">reggie</person> mcneal, when its not there s making a play and bud foster is getting after his guys to get after the quarterback &gt;&gt; kirk: bud foster can only do so much when a quarterback is back there and he can create we used to see a quarterback here named mike <person player="marcus vick" race="UNK" position="QB">vick</person> who used to be able to do this<person player="reggie mcneal" race="UNK" position="QB">reggie mcneal</person>is outrunning a defense that can move around thats 15, 20 yards hes able to pick up on a broken play and theres nothing bud foster can do about that &gt;&gt; lee: outrunning that<person player="michael crawford" race="UNK" position="DB">michael crawford</person>you were talking about like he was standing there in cement that kid is a pretty fast football player mction <person player="reggie mcneal" race="UNK" position="QB">mcneal</person> 65 of those 72 a&amp;m rushing yards lewis is pulled down by colas, but a good contain there gain there of five yards lee, weve seen now <person player="reggie mcneal" race="UNK" position="QB">mcneal</person> who may have more speed than he did last year hes got an ability to get the corner as the linebackers and the dbacks, have you to take a different angle because <person player="reggie mcneal" race="UNK" position="QB">mcneal</person> is getting past you all of the time? &gt;&gt; lee: no one of the things they did that time was put man for man underneath and nobody to take the quarterback if i was playing mcnaturally, id keep him inside and fnt of me and never play mantoman for linebackers id spy them every time because hes the only real great football player they have offensively &gt;&gt; mike: from the 38 handoff inside lewis inside the 30, to the 27 first down aggies trying to drive for a gametying score lets visit with rece davis to see what comes up at halftime &gt;&gt; rece: mike, trev alberts and mark way ma by me we will have five teams and five questions to look forward to this weekend also to update you on quarterback injuries, including one for the reigning champion well also have the results which conference is the best? &gt;&gt;

mike: first and goal lewis tries to bounce it to the outside and score he does! touchdown, aggies theyll go for two to try to swear the game here in blacksburg ninetyeightyard drive &gt;&gt; lee: <person player="reggie mcneal" race="UNK" position="QB">reggie</person> mcneal, wow number 16 sophomore &gt;&gt; kirk:<person player="reggie mcneal" race="UNK" position="QB">reggie mcneal</person>is the real deal &gt;&gt; lee: good one i like that one &gt;&gt; kirk: <person player="courtney lewis" race="UNK" position="RB">courtney</person> lewis, i think gives him a different gear in the back field that they havent had in a few years theyve had big strong backs in the last three or four years but now youre talking about a guy with some speed to go along with the stalent of<person player="reggie mcneal" race="UNK" position="QB">reggie mcneal</person>and the receivers they have if they can continue to grow confidence, theyre not only dangerous tonight a&amp;m has a nice offensive passage &gt;&gt; mike: see what they run on twopoint conversion move <person player="reggie mcneal" race="UNK" position="QB">mcneal</person> maroon shirts come with him and incomplete pass intended for terrance thomas burchette, whos in for the injured<person player="cols colas" race="UNK" position="DL">cols colas</person>put the heat on <person player="reggie mcneal" race="UNK" position="QB">mcneal</person> and it remains 1412 texas a&amp;m went 98 yards <person player="reggie mcneal" race="UNK" position="QB">mcneal</person> made the play alive he turned his corner, used his speed and passed <person player="michael crawford" race="UNK" position="DB">crawford</person> and <person player="vegas robinson" race="UNK" position="LB">robinson</person> in the defense and one big pass set up this run for lewis &gt;&gt; mike: it is nonstop action in a very fastmoving first half here in blacksburg good game i dont think people thought a&amp;m would come on the road and play like this theyve rolled the dice a couple of times and had help from tech and also controlled the line of scrimmage &gt;&gt; kirk: thats the shocker &gt;&gt; mike: ball off the return man picked up by the second option,<person player="mike imoh" race="UNK" position="RB">mike imoh</person>they only get out to the 16 yard line so it bounced,<person player="ronald jones" race="UNK" position="DB">ronald jones</person>made the play and bounced off <person player="cedric humes" race="UNK" position="RB">cedric</person> hughes lets check in with doc &gt;&gt; jerry: the field is called a <person player="eric green" race="UNK" position="DB">green</person> tech system 4,0004by4 squares of bermuda grass and it has 22 drains these drains come up right here and this machine behind me, the mother of all vacuum cleaners, puleds out pulls about 60 inches of water an hour doing a phenomenal job although its wet back here and feels like a hurricane, its dry on the playing field this system is doing a heck of a job here keeping the field nice and dry &gt;&gt; mike: we dont need you running into the mother of all vacuums, doc thats why this field is in good shape first down for jones goes nowhere a&amp;m only has one timeout the hokies with a minute left here might be best advised to keep it lowkey &gt;&gt; lee: 1412 wouldnt it be interesting to see dr jerry punch sucked into that thing? &gt;&gt; mike: we need our boy! look at this number &gt;&gt; kirk: youre looking at a big difference for texas a&amp;m a big problem for them is sustaining drives and keeping the ball away from their opponent tonight, youre right i got raise my hand i think a lot of us do who thought texas a&amp;m could hold their own in this first half &gt;&gt; mike:<person player="kevin jones" race="UNK" position="RB">kevin jones</person>stays inbounds down at the 19 yard line a&amp;m is going to hold on to that timeout and i think the hokies are going to take take it on in &gt;&gt; kirk: the other thing this does is the crowd in the game? theyre gone theyre no longer a factor and one team is going into the showers with confidence and the other team right now is going back trying to refigure what they can do to get their swagger back &gt;&gt; lee: dont forget, utah came back in the second half against the texas a&amp;m team when they got tired &gt;&gt; mike: 1412 at the half &gt;&gt; jerry: are you surprised how easily on offense youve moved the ball and better defensive football team? &gt;&gt; they are a good defensive team and always are a great drive there ru9 yards and we made a mistake or two and got it in the zone i dont know if i want to say surprised just lease pleased &gt;&gt; jerry: what a job the <person player="jacob young" race="UNK" position="P">young</person> quarterback has done in the first half &gt;&gt; you see him growing before your eyes he made some mistakes, but you see him getting better and it makes you feel good as a coach &gt;&gt; jerry: how about the weather? given the hurricane conditions and the wind? &gt;&gt; the field is in great shape and the wind is not a factor a little bit of wind and a great evening to play football in a lot of ways &gt;&gt; mike: weve had 70 plays, if you include special teams tech won the toss they have the option in the secoou, rece we call that a dead heat and here, big east against big 12 big east with three teams up in the top eleven and way down there the hokies lead by 2 th is aure watch weather you see blacksburg, sixhour triple doppler loop i always wanted to do that you see were in the loop we were breaking it down theyre a mile and a half away and said 13 inches of rain so far during the evening darkness on mostly in this game the winds are not supposed to get much heavier than this their highest gusts over there a mile away, 35 miles per hour and they expect conditions will stay like this the remainder of the game tech had the option in the second half to start theyve chosen to take the ball to start the second half the wind at their back kickoff is short! live ball and picked up by the hokies at the 23 yard line kicking into the wind it didnt make it all the way back and nearly a turnover good job by the linebacker 21, plays, time of possession and yards, texas a&amp;m advantage over virginia tech &gt;&gt; lee: zero turnovers in this kind of weather, amazing &gt;&gt; kirk: ive been impressed with<person player="reggie mcneal" race="UNK" position="QB">reggie mcneal</person>the offensive line controlling the line of scrimmage against virginia tech and the great receiver and running backs virginia techs defense need to turn it around in the secondalf &gt;&gt; mike: big ball and <person player="ernest wilford" race="UNK" position="WR">wilford</person> breaks free and couldnt get to it and <person player="bryan randall" race="UNK" position="QB">randall</person> knows he had a man shooting open in the secondary oh, so close nice shots, guys here are our numbers at halftime 21 in total yards tech only passed for 38 21 in time of possession &gt;&gt; lee: nice offensive balance by texas a&amp;mx m i said it the other way before the game, virginia tech had 227 rushing and about 240 passing wonderful offensive performance by texas a&amp;m &gt;&gt; mike: wind at their back second and tep handoff to<person player="kevin jones" race="UNK" position="RB">kevin jones</person>gets to the outside! almost off to the races! he was tripped up at the 37 by<person player="jaxson appel" race="UNK" position="DB">jaxson appel</person>i think one of the a&amp;m defenders had an angle on him about 14 yards is an exhale for the aggie fans here is a the game track we have a good one here hurricanesabel has pushed the wind gusts over 35 miles per hour we havent seen turnovers we have seen the kicking game affected the most tech scored on its first two possessions and shut down since then offensively texas a&amp;m have handled this game well <person player="reggie mcneal" race="UNK" position="QB">reggie</person> mcneal, hes been a blur running with the ball 69 total yards after the run, first and ten randall, nobody to throw and run he shows some of his rushing ability out to the 45 david ross, the defensive end, a sophomore, pursued him out of bounds we have not seen<person player="marcus vick" race="UNK" position="QB">marcus vick</person>yet tonight the virginia tech coaches talked about getting him a series, but as this game has gone on and tight and a tough spot, there hasnt been as many series won and the opportunity to get <person player="marcus vick" race="UNK" position="QB">vick</person> on the field &gt;&gt; kirk: virginia tech hasnt had the football and tough to get<person player="marcus vick" race="UNK" position="QB">marcus vick</person>in in a game like this where the weather is a factor although we may still may see him in the second half &gt;&gt; mike: nice misdirection jones in the belly of the aggie defense! down to the 33 yard line! 22 yards and jackson <person player="jaxson appel" race="UNK" position="DB">appel</person> tackles him first down for the hokie back &gt;&gt; lee: at the beginning of the ball ga, our colleague said the key to the ball game would be you got it, number 25,<person player="kevin jones" race="UNK" position="RB">kevin jones</person>and his running ability kirk, has done a better job of seeing those holes tonight than ive seen him in the last couple of years &gt;&gt; kirk: i think hes making better decisions and quicker decisions but getting an opportunity to find his rhythm with lee suggs in the back field and sharing the duties the last few years, hes had to share his duties a game jones can make a statement about being one of the best backs in the country &gt;&gt; mike: turning the corner here he is again hit hard out of bounds by brandon lee owne &gt;&gt; lee: it looked like a halftime adjustment by beamer and his staff was<person player="kevin jones" race="UNK" position="RB">kevin jones</person>kevin jones,<person player="kevin jones" race="UNK" position="RB">kevin jones</person>i think thats a good idea because their line is starting to play a lot better and coming off the ball and getting in the face of the texas a&amp;mx defenders &gt;&gt; kirk: i think theyre trying to get physical up front and done it different ways the shot gun and the iformation and come back with the i here &gt;&gt; mike: see if <person player="bryan randall" race="UNK" position="QB">randall</person> throws to one of those receivers has time and it is broken up! flag comes in he wanted <person player="richard johnson" race="UNK" position="WR">richard</person> johnson, but<person player="sean weston" race="UNK" position="DB">sean weston</person>got a hand on it and on the man, first &gt;&gt; referee: pass interference on the defense 15 yards from the previous spot first down &gt;&gt; kirk: when you run the football, its going to set up the play action had he two choices on the post route boy, thats a gray area a tough call there &gt;&gt; lee: the official that called it was from behind and he must have seen him hit him with his body because he certainly didnt hit him with his hands i mean, that was a questionable call right there &gt;&gt; mike: once again, big 12 officials or big east officials this game was played in college station last year with big east officials two minutes in, third quarter hokies leading, although it doesnt feel like theyre leading right now this drive changing the tone of the game a little bit for the tight end its incomplete that is nearly holding on manning, the linebacker youre going to see a fistful of jerseys as<person player="keith willis" race="UNK" position="TE">keith willis</person>was trying to shake free for six &gt;&gt; kirk: if youre scouting virginia tech they like the full back out in the flat and the tight end vertical wn they get &gt;&gt; referee: defensive pass interference first down at the spot of the foul &gt;&gt; kk: theyve gone to that play about three different times already here in this game because of easlicks ability to get in the flat and make plays and the tight ends to get up the field that time, i think the defender was beat again and if he didnt grab ahold of him, its probably a touchdown &gt;&gt; mike: a clear penalty how about defensive holding? he got enough body to make it a spot foul as opposed to the five yas thats good for virginia tech who will have first and goal coming up here the ball blew away with the wind down there wind a little bit less of a factor because of the closed in stadium here jones looking up inside! did he get? yes! touchdown! an impressive opening drive the hokies back on top by eight so a couple of penalties move them closer jones bang ts in a couple more touchdowns for him on the night four on the season carter worley, nasty looking extra point, but its good two possession game a ninepoint lead &gt;&gt; mike: virginia tech leading texas a&amp;m 2112 as the rain continues to pelt the fans in that south end zone wind blowing lefttoright as we watch quarter number three this kick is with the wind brandon tate the result is an 80yard drive ahead for the aggies lee, as the aggies take the field for the second half, lets look at your home depot coaching adjustments &gt;&gt; lee: if i was bud foster, id make my defensive ends come to the outside there is a perfect example of the linebackers vegetable ars <person player="vegas robinson" race="UNK" position="LB">robinson</person> letting <person player="reggie mcneal" race="UNK" position="QB">mcneal</person> get to the outside <person player="john kirk" race="UNK" position="OL">kirk</person> and mike, you got to keep this guy inside and then the linebackers have got to fill from the inside out you cant catch him once he gets around those guys &gt;&gt; kirk: the problem is like you said inside out, i dont know how many of those linebackers take him down from the inside out &gt;&gt; lee: i know one thing, they cant get to him on the outside &gt;&gt; mike: fifth possession of the night for the aggies oneyard run for <person player="derek farmer" race="UNK" position="RB">farmer</person> on first down jerry punch? &gt;&gt; jerry: exactly what lee just said he challenges defense to be physical and play virginia tech physical football the focus trying to maintain outside contain up front on<person player="reggie mcneal" race="UNK" position="QB">reggie mcneal</person>a mild change in the secondary with a change in the coverage, they may be able to get a pick on the pass corage here early in the second half &gt;&gt; mike: second half, that will see us bumping with rain and wind again a&amp;m driving into this wind in quarter number three on the delay <person player="derek farmer" race="UNK" position="RB">farmer</person> will get to the 23 yard line thats about all hoki<person player="vegas robinson" race="UNK" position="LB">vegas robinson</person>comes out with the ball but it was whistled dead jerry punch is down on the sideline doc, id be curious if you feel down on the field that the wind has picked up in velocity from the first half? &gt;&gt; jerry: it had died down in the middle of the second quarter and was pretty mild going into halftime i think the wind right now is as much as weve had tonight and as you mentioned earlier, theyre expecting wind gusts in 30 on to 35 miles an hour range the wind out here is giving a swirl &gt;&gt; mike: going into third and seven might be a run for number 16, the sophomore aggie quarterback here is <person player="reggie mcneal" race="UNK" position="QB">mcneal</person> he will throw it incomplete dangelo <person player="deangelo hall" race="nonwhite" position="DB">hall</person> hasnt been tested much <person player="terrence murphy" race="UNK" position="WR">murphy</person> wasnt pope number 4 is really good playing both ways hes going back to try to touch a punt into the wind now a junior out of chess peek, virginia &gt;&gt; lee: the first player in 40 years at virginia tech to start offense, defense and special teams 40 years! &gt;&gt; mike: into the wind remember that 15yard punt was also in the wind tech broke through the middle watch out they may come after one here theyre coming! theyre going to get him! pulled him down and he got away can he get the first down at the 30? what a move by scates! to the 35! <person player="cody scates" race="UNK" position="P">cody</person> scates! wow! &gt;&gt; lee: yo! thats worth a yo! &gt;&gt; mike: again, an allamerican punter who has been injured and did not kick the first two games 15yard run &gt;&gt; kirk: wch his back route he is a former option quarterback? picks up a good block and right here, against the starting free safety in<person player="jimmy williams" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jimmy williams</person>then he takes a big hit from a db, but, i tell you, <person player="cody scates" race="UNK" position="P">scates</person> is a heck of an athlete! &gt;&gt; mike: played only one season of football in high school and was not a position player, just a kicker &gt;&gt; kirk: they need to use him &gt;&gt; mike: from the 38, mcneal, option a game changing play thats a block 8,000 hokie maroon shirts coming to scoop and score! the place goes nuts game is over game change &gt;&gt; kirk: yeah especially three and out start the second half after virginia tech drives the length of the field so far, the play of the game for texas a&amp;m &gt;&gt; lee: every time weve been here, theyve scored in bunches you know what i mean? even gameday, when weve been here for gameday you know what i mean &gt;&gt; kirk: the crowd gets into the game one second is a close game and the next second, blowout &gt;&gt; mike: markers are down &gt;&gt; referee: before the snap, false start on the offense movement in the interior line five yards second down &gt;&gt; mike: dennis franchione didnt have this drawn up look at this a kick thats blocked six points seven guys a chance to tackle him he made<person player="jimmy williams" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jimmy williams</person>miss a heck of a safety! &gt;&gt; lee: he made number 4, dangelo <person player="deangelo hall" race="nonwhite" position="DB">hall</person> miss him or a first down &gt;&gt; kirk: <person player="jimmy williams" race="nonwhite" position="DB">williams</person> versus <person player="cody scates" race="UNK" position="P">scates</person> and beat the starting three in the open field &gt;&gt; mike: pressure, put it up for grabs look out incomplete <person player="jonathan lewis" race="UNK" position="DL">jonathan</person> lewis, one of two brothers who played defensive tackle here, two big kids out of richmond, <person player="jonathan lewis" race="UNK" position="DL">jonathan</person> and kevin, jonathan, that time, got the heat &gt;&gt; lee: you can tell theyre changing strategy a little bit they fought <person player="cols colas" race="UNK" position="DL">colas</person> and <person player="nathaniel adibi" race="UNK" position="DL">adibi</person> from the outside and push up from the outside against the two lewis brothers &gt;&gt; kirk: theyre playing with a different energy in this second half we talked xs and os and schemes gout to be excited this defense now looks like theyre flying around a little bit &gt;&gt; mike: wat 55, <person player="darryl tapp" race="UNK" position="DL">darryl</person> tapp, they like him the throw is incomplete over the middle no flags and now going to have to kick it bud fosters defense in a sudden change situation got the job done the good news was you made an unbelievable play, the bad news you punted twice theyve come right up the gut both times <person player="dustin long" race="UNK" position="QB">dustin</person> hamilton, 27, wide receiver, licking his chops hes dan dancing over the centers head kick away and a good kick in the wind terrific kick in the from the 23, dangelo <person player="deangelo hall" race="nonwhite" position="DB">hall</person> brought down after a pickup of four<person player="byron jones" race="nonwhite" position="DB">byron jones</person>made the play the net is 33 no points in that drive sin told mece 0 &gt;&gt; mike: blacksburg, virginia is 325 miles inland from virginia beach, the area hit so heavily by hurricane isabel as it moves up into the nations capital area, this area being brushed with a western fringe first and ten, virginia tech leading by nine from the 26 its <person player="bryan randall" race="UNK" position="QB">randall</person> just into the middle of the aggie defense for a yard or so kirk, virginia tech has run, what? 20 less plays than a&amp;m run less than a play in the minute here as were in the middle of the third quarter this drive could be a big one &gt;&gt; kirk: i think its part of the learning process for both teams the way the game went in the first half, virginia tech came out with a different attitude went down the field and forced two and three outs i think this drive here is a back breaker for aggies a big drive for a&amp;m they need to get the ball back to<person player="reggie mcneal" race="UNK" position="QB">reggie mcneal</person>&gt;&gt; mike: the quarterback <person player="bryan randall" race="UNK" position="QB">randall</person> looks to throw now looks to run right at the first down line well check the spot as he slid across the 35 &gt;&gt; lee: one thing also very important is the fact that they have the wind to their back and continue to keep the ball going, even if theyre stopped, this punter, has been putting the ball down inside the 10 against the wind good field position and defense rallies know how they do here? score comes from the outside and out of the stands and gets the ball and scores theyre amazing when they get hot at this place &gt;&gt; mike: the threegame for the first 73 snaps from scrimmage tonight make it 74 but that one is going to be real close jones stuck it up on in there i dont know if hes going to walk out of there with a first down montgomery, but just enough forward progress to move the chains montgomery and bryce reed got in there the red shirt freshman out of dallas, samuel high school, thought he stopped him shy of the first down &gt;&gt; kirk: the linebackers may be inexperienced as far as games are concerned but theyre running around and making things happen theyre not afraid of collisions theyre very athletic theyre going to get better as the year goes on theyre just <person player="jacob young" race="UNK" position="P">young</person> &gt;&gt; mike: hokies come out of the gun here for first and ten i love this look with jones on this play to the 43 well have second down and 3 that is the third time jones has lost his shoe hes going to come on out and<person player="cedric humes" race="UNK" position="RB">cedric humes</person>will come on in here are some of the highlights on espn brock berlin and number 2 miami go to chestnut hills available on hd now available nationwide check them out in iowa city against the hawkeye team second out pass complete to kris reed a first down to the 47 yard line veer back after missing the game with a concussion lets look at the numbers &gt;&gt; lee: obviously an advantage is the wind but not showing there is the hidden yardage with the punting game remember, the one forced punt by virginia tech making the short punt by texas a&amp;m gave them field position into the touchdown &gt;&gt; mike: opening drive set a tone &gt;&gt; l: exactly &gt;&gt; mike: after picking uphe first down, go to the top again this someone caught by<person player="richard johnson" race="UNK" position="WR">richard johnson</person>shoved down at mid field jax <person player="jaxson appel" race="UNK" position="DB">appel</person> and<person player="sean weston" race="UNK" position="DB">sean weston</person>in on the tackle &gt;&gt; kirk: were starting to see the balance of <person player="bryan randall" race="UNK" position="QB">randall</person> and the virginia tech ochs they didnt have the ball in the first half and now youre starting to see them throw the football more on first a ten and back to<person player="kevin jones" race="UNK" position="RB">kevin jones</person>the last two drives so now youre seeing what their comfort zone in trying to use the short conservative passing game and when they lull you to sleep they try to go over the top &gt;&gt; mike: 7 of 10 tonight thrown 58 times this year with 16 incompletions very accurate and has not turned the ball over this year<person player="kevin jones" race="UNK" position="RB">kevin jones</person>junior out of chester, pennsylvania right at the line near a first down <person player="anthony wright" race="UNK" position="WR">anthony</person> squillante made the tackle out of carroll high school in south lake, texas &gt;&gt; lee: the thing thats impressed me more about<person player="kevin jones" race="UNK" position="RB">kevin jones</person>tonight as i remember him, is that hes quicker hes 221 pounds but, kirk, hes got that little extra purse i didnt see last year maybe he just worked on it enough? &gt;&gt; kirk: again, its just getting more carries and finding the zone hes always been a guy that runs a 4:18 and definitely can get it done number one rated prep player in high school football in 2001 &gt;&gt; mike: he got stuck at the yellow line there and well have another interesting spot<person player="jaxson appel" race="UNK" position="DB">jaxson appel</person>came up and let him know he was there fourth down at their 44 wind at your back leading by nine &gt;&gt; kirk: a hunt here &gt;&gt; lee: hunt it aarp, hunt it! aarp punts it the new generation goes for it &gt;&gt; mike: frank is 56 aarp? &gt;&gt; lee: yes, sir &gt;&gt; mike: he is yet to get the card? &gt;&gt; lee: he looks like an aarp guy, but he isnt hes a very attractive guy &gt;&gt; mike: two years in alabama ages you the punt by <person player="vinnie burns" race="UNK" position="P">burns</person> punt down to the 10 and see if quarter can get some yardage he does special teams tackle from<person player="blake warren" race="UNK" position="LB">blake warren</person>&gt;&gt; mike: aggies down by nine into the wind the steady sheets of rain continue kirk, is this a nervous time if you are a texas a&amp;m fan? &gt;&gt; kirk: i think if its the beginning of the game if youre the quarterback, mcneal, youre confident and feel its time to get this offense going and especially if you can get to 5:09 and get the ball and wind in your back &gt;&gt; mike: throwing into the wind thats pass is caught by van zant give him 5 at the 25 good protection from the oline &gt;&gt; jerry: the offense going to get going, its going to depend on the big guys up front like <person player="alan reuber" race="UNK" position="OL">reuber</person> who is a big boy and little boy, he had an appetite take a look here when he was 2 years old, his mom took him to an all you can eat breakfast at mcdonald he ate 13 pcakes at the age of 2 now, he eats a raw roast for dinner tonight yes, i said raw roast hes a big boy &gt;&gt; mike: thirteen pancakes at age 2? man! that is a curbside breakfast <person player="reggie mcneal" race="UNK" position="QB">mcneal</person> just survives dongive it up<person player="vegas robinson" race="UNK" position="LB">vegas robinson</person>made the play penetration from <person player="michael crawford" race="UNK" position="DB">crawford</person> &gt;&gt; lee: perfect example of bud foster we talked about containing the quarterback to the outside and making him cut to the inside you notice the outside defender there? a db has got him and forces him to to the inside and the linebackers who are now coming from the inside out as i told you, that time, <person player="vegas robinson" race="UNK" position="LB">robinson</person> came from the inside out to make the tackle perfect illustration of keeping him there are the pancakes look at that is that good? they got to be dollar pancakes &gt;&gt; mike: at age 2? &gt;&gt; lee: contain inside linebacker &gt;&gt; mike: he doesnt want to get pancaked here does a nice to be at the top pressure from the middle high thr is incomplete mcne took a shot that time from<person player="jason lallis" race="UNK" position="DL">jason lallis</person>he backs up one of the lewis brothers fresh legs, good push &gt;&gt; kirk: the difference in the second half is <person player="reggie mcneal" race="UNK" position="QB">mcneal</person> cant find his rhythm theyre getting pressure and hes not feeling as comfortable in the pocketnd his throws even when hes had time, theyve bee high and because hes starting to feel that pressure around him from bud fosters defense &gt;&gt; mike: <person player="justin hamilton" race="UNK" position="WR">hamilton</person> can get off the edge and block<person player="cody scates" race="UNK" position="P">cody scates</person>punt they tried the middle rush the first couple of times<person player="vincent fuller" race="nonwhite" position="DB">vincent fuller</person>edging in as well a good break in and getting close and pull it down! and hes pulled down at the 8! by james anderson! a marker is down bull the virginia tech special teams continue to impact every game they perform in offside on the hokies &gt;&gt; referee: fiveyard penalty it was <person player="vincent fuller" race="nonwhite" position="DB">fuller</person> who came dancing on the edge he gets to do that again &gt;&gt; kirk: a lot of movement up front there on both sides &gt;&gt; mike: somebody in the neutral zone perhaps? &gt;&gt; kirk: must have been up at the top &gt;&gt; lee: i think <person player="vincent fuller" race="nonwhite" position="DB">fuller</person> or ferguson, it looked like they jumped a little bit too quick &gt;&gt; kirk: i lot a little bit of movement on the a&amp;m side thats what virginia tech was pointing to &gt;&gt; mike: 27, hes now lining up inside, hamilton, they keep exchanging people theyre loaded heavy on the right side left the middle free able to get this away a quick rugbylike kick aggies hit it forward theyre back at mid field thats where its marked even though they down it there at the 32, its touched and the penalty marker has come down as well as<person player="everett smith" race="UNK" position="LB">everett smith</person>batted the ball forward the punt was 23 lets see if his act will than penalized we remind you baseball tonight airs on espn2 they have the impact of the hurricane as well currently a terrific decision to move the yankeesorioles game up at noon and tied at 1 and a delay illegal touching sign not one you see every week against the aggies &gt;&gt; kirk: i think hes going to get called because it was so deliberate when hes smacking it 15 mike: it will be mike: it will be referred to technicall as illegal batting &gt;&gt; referee: the ball was illegally batted by the kicking team the penalty is refused virginia tech ball &gt;&gt; mike: it happened to you? &gt;&gt; lee: yes the holiday bowl, the ball was punted it hit my man and their man in the head the ball was rolling my guy picked it up and went all the way for a touchdown they said watch him you can advance a ball thats hit by that guy and not have a penalty exactly the rule &gt;&gt; kirk: when was this? &gt;&gt; lee: 1979 holiday bowl ill show it to you again &gt;&gt; mike: jones into the secondary down at the 38 and a first down you can sense in this third quarter, virginia tech has taken over the line of scrimmage &gt;&gt; lee: yes &gt;&gt; kirk: now were starting to see<person player="kevin jones" race="UNK" position="RB">kevin jones</person>in rhythm and this is his 20th carry i dont know how many times last year he had a chance to get 20 carries in lee suggs happenedo be healthy but it wasnt very often now this back field is his this is when you start to get into your comfort zone if the ball is yours look at the rhythm and quickness and acceleration and explosion to pick up the yardage &gt;&gt; mike: he had 171 against marshall last year when we were here <person player="bryan randall" race="UNK" position="QB">randall</person> going to run for it a great ball fake got past the defense out to the 25 hes pulled down late out of bounds no flag comes there there is a 24 after a run of 14 for <person player="bryan randall" race="UNK" position="QB">randall</person> &gt;&gt; kirk: there is the difference between<person player="bryan randall" race="UNK" position="QB">bryan randall</person>in 2003 and in 2002 this year,<person player="bryan randall" race="UNK" position="QB">bryan randall</person>seized the defense and instead of forcing a throw as inexperienced quarterback,e made the read and used his feeto pick up the yardage you can see, last year as he sits back here, fields it and feels the pressure he would have thrown that ball this time, use the speed to pick up big yards &gt;&gt; lee: this guy, kevin rogers, the quarterback coach that used to be at syracuse and notre dame? hes one of the best quarterback coaches around you can see what <person player="bryan randall" race="UNK" position="QB">randall</person> has done under his tutelage &gt;&gt; mike: rolls to the right two receivers over here and one <person player="justin hamilton" race="UNK" position="WR">hamilton</person> and intercepted! all that set up <person player="jaxson appel" race="UNK" position="DB">appel</person> first time <person player="bryan randall" race="UNK" position="QB">randall</person> has turned it over in nearly 11 quarters a penalty marker is down after the play on the near side but the games first turnover comes on snap 84 of the night &gt;&gt; referee: the ball is intercepted dead ball personal foul on virginia tech 15yard penalty &gt;&gt; mike: woe give it to them in good field position <person player="jaxson appel" race="UNK" position="DB">appel</person> playing with a screw in his hand after the broken bone earlier this season the free safety comes up with the interception &gt;&gt; kirk: how many times have you been watching a game and when the announcers talk about how great a guy is playing? <person player="jaxson appel" race="UNK" position="DB">appel</person> is right in the throwing lane thats exactly what<person player="bryan randall" race="UNK" position="QB">bryan randall</person>has tried to work out of his game <person player="jaxson appel" race="UNK" position="DB">appel</person> didnt, all of a sudden, come in he was sitting right there and thats when<person player="bryan randall" race="UNK" position="QB">bryan randall</person>is going to have to learn from when he looks at the film thats reverting back to last year &gt;&gt; mike: <person player="reggie mcneal" race="UNK" position="QB">mcneal</person> gives it to <person player="keith joseph" race="UNK" position="RB">joseph</person> who pounds forward for nine 256 pounds of back there and once again, many momentum moving night have another shift crkss the defense, the last two series coming up with big plays to keep them in this game virginia tech, youre right, mike with this crowd, you get up by that many points and tough for a&amp;m to get back in it but the defensive plays have kept them in the game &gt;&gt; lee: nice ball control against the wind in the fourth quarter, a&amp;m gets the wind &gt;&gt; mike: hardest rain of the night as the rain comes down in sheets the inside backers, <person player="vegas robinson" race="UNK" position="LB">robinson</person> and <person player="mikal baaqee" race="UNK" position="LB">baaqee</person> you see the rain coming sideways its lefttoright following the wind and the wind continuing to move the flags as much as it has all night a forecast for the gusts getting into the 30 plus range when this game went on is proving to be accurate 51st snap of the aggies they havent turned it over yet tonight first and ten near mid field<person player="courtney lewis" race="UNK" position="RB">courtney lewis</person>so much penetration now from the hokies <person player="michael crawford" race="UNK" position="DB">crawford</person> gets back there for the stop second and ten coming up all is quiet in the midwest except for the pennant races the astros and cubs at the top the cardinals on wild card life support and never mind that central division life support as well well see albert pujols in the hunt for october continues on esp in tomorrow night at 8:00 eastern and 5:00 pacific astros and cubs, a great race going cards really lost their chance this past weekend second and ten lewis is stopped what a game for<person player="michael crawford" race="UNK" position="DB">michael crawford</person>hes been involved in almost every big play hes approaching double digits in tackles on the night &gt;&gt; kirk: what is amazing is the rover, usually you have a guy is a strong safety or rover off the line a little bit he walks up a lot of times, hes able to make the play in the back field he is walking up to the end of the line of scrimmage by the defensive end and just coming right down nobody is picking him up pretty easy to him to come down and nobody block him and make the big plays &gt;&gt; mike: a guy last year who was qoryed about his life as he found a lump and went for a biopsy and found lymphoma and found out january, cancer free and is playing with great passion this season <person player="reggie mcneal" race="UNK" position="QB">mcneal</person> on the run he threw and incomplete terrance <person player="terrence murphy" race="UNK" position="WR">murphy</person> saw a fastball a wet fastball flying by his ear hole no chance of catching that in front of<person player="eric green" race="UNK" position="DB">eric green</person>&gt;&gt; kirk: pretty good coverage there by<person player="eric green" race="UNK" position="DB">eric green</person>tough to stay with the receiver that <person player="dustin long" race="UNK" position="QB">long</person> when the quarterback buys all that time &gt;&gt; lee: at least on this situation, the center is snapping the ball with the wind, which hell get a good snap keep your eye on the punter as we watch <person player="cody scates" race="UNK" position="P">scates</person> because if he catches the ball into his stomach again, thats dangerous got to catch it way out there and kick it thats it like that &gt;&gt; mike: into the wind and<person player="deangelo hall" race="nonwhite" position="DB">deangelo hall</person>touches it and aggie ball at the 24 you cannot advance a muff but you can recover it and exactly what happened and the aggies will take over at the tech 24!<person player="byron jones" race="nonwhite" position="DB">byron jones</person>comes up with the recovery &gt;&gt;

kirk: i like how you refer to that as the wall because the football does i mean, it comes straight down making it tough on <person player="deangelo hall" race="nonwhite" position="DB">hall</person> to judge it and adjust right there a&amp;m catching another break and staying in this football game &gt;&gt; mike: caught about three breaks in the third quarter we have first and ten from the 24 pulls behind the guard and the block was nothing &gt;&gt; lee: and your man &gt;&gt; mike:<person player="michael crawford" race="UNK" position="DB">michael crawford</person>ends the third quarter with a great play 11tackle night for <person player="michael crawford" race="UNK" position="DB">crawford</person> the lone score quarter three came on the opening drive of<person player="kevin jones" race="UNK" position="RB">kevin jones</person>touchdown run ♪♪ &gt;&gt;

lee: remember their staff went to wake forest and they picked him up there wake forest, yeah &gt;&gt; mike: jones has had runs of more than ten yards will he make it seven? going to get to the corner wouldnt turn it good speed shown by <person player="ronald jones" race="UNK" position="DB">ronald</person> jones, the strong safety, out of skyline high school in dallas second leading tackler they beat arkansas state by 15 and utah by 2 in college station &gt;&gt;

jerry: mike, he was shoved out of bounds a player ejected who shoved him out of bounds he hyperenglish tended both of his wrists trying to stop himself from hitting the concrete wall i asked him on thursday, he said both of them are still pretty sore his only concern is his grip is not back to a hundred percent and that was a little bit of a concern tonight with a wet football, he wouldnt be abl to hold on but thus far, hes done an awesome job running and not only that, but holding on to the football &gt;&gt; mike: hell take a break <person player="cedric humes" race="UNK" position="RB">cedric</person> hughes, a sophomore out of virginia beach, comes in hughes runs it in there for about a yard or so you know, we talk about this game, the impact of the weather and the wind and all this on the game itself we forget that so many of these virginia tech kids are recruited from that chess peek tide water virginia beach area that has been slammed by the hurricane more than any other area of the state, so a lot of these players certainly are worried about their parents at home and their friends and making sure everybody is okay they usually come to the games there is a big game on their home schedule and a lot cant be here tonight these guys are playing with a focus that is altered a little bit by the situation at home hughes up the middle! to the 30! first down unstoppable &gt;&gt; kirk: hughes likes the play, too &gt;&gt; lee: yeah &gt;&gt; kirk: its just almost counteraction &gt;&gt; lee: yeah &gt;&gt; kirk: its not real fancy a shot gun, blocking, pushing the zone and pushing everything to the right and then just finding a big hole sometime kicks to the outside and sometimes up the middle but hughes is there and feeling comfortable with that same play that<person player="kevin jones" race="UNK" position="RB">kevin jones</person>has had a lot of success with &gt;&gt; lee: you notice the second guard, number 66, will montgomery, made a nice block of taking the linebacker past the play &gt;&gt; mike: the future star up front and next to the center,<person player="jake grove" race="UNK" position="OL">jake grove</person>dancing is jones and trying to move to the outside pulldown tackle there by<person player="jaxson appel" race="UNK" position="DB">jaxson appel</person>who is a classic way and sportsman like, offers a hand back up to the man he just tackled i like this i dont care whats going to happen here in the last 11:30 this is a team thats playing with terrific points in their first road game a <person player="jacob young" race="UNK" position="P">young</person> team for dennis franchione &gt;&gt; kirk: gism him two or three years to recruit and his personality a matter of times that texas a&amp;mx will be competing with the big boys from the big 12 &gt;&gt; three wide out of the gun its jones to the 26 you almost wait for him to hand it off to the receiver oe and break their back dennis franchione was at alabama, obviously, a lot of ask her nation in the decision as he left to go back to texas a&amp;m slocum has been there for 15 years the first time they are playing a road game without slocum a team adjusting to a new system but i think the time was right all the way around because the players needed a new voice and new pattern to follow &gt;&gt; lee: speaking of slocum, hes here watching the football game up in the press box &gt;&gt; mike: third and six need to get to the 20 to keep the drive alive the pressure up the middle <person player="bryan randall" race="UNK" position="QB">randall</person> gets away! hes got the corner to run! to the line for a first down and more! to the 13 yard line! smith got in he couldnt get him and players make plays hes a player &gt;&gt; lee: the interesting thing to me is i dont know if ole<person player="marcus vick" race="UNK" position="QB">marcus vick</person>is going to get into many games anymor this guy is good &gt;&gt; kirk: i dont think there was any debate coming into the game this was third down and makes up for that interception the pressure got in you could see the strength this is one of the strongest quarterbacks, i think the strongest quarterback to ever come to a virginia tech and use that strength there to knock off a defender at 295 pounds &gt;&gt; mike: from the 13 jones trying to cut it back to the middle aggies have been on the field for a lot of plays in this second half able to slow him down<person player="johnny jolly" race="UNK" position="DL">johnny jolly</person>and archie mcdaniel in there on the tackle there is <person player="johnny jolly" race="UNK" position="DL">jolly</person> out of forest brook in houston &gt;&gt; lee: i think its worth repeating when the virginia tech coaches told us two players in all of the years theyve been here, they got that fire in that belly more than ybody else michaelick and<person player="bryan randall" race="UNK" position="QB">bryan randall</person>that is one heck of a combo &gt;&gt; mike: split willis, the tight end, out wide each with the full backs to block the block the pressure and <person player="bryan randall" race="UNK" position="QB">randall</person> takes off if he wasnt pulled down there, he might have gotten to the end zone sophomore<person player="brian patrick" race="UNK" position="DL">brian patrick</person>made a very nice play third down coming up field goal keeps a&amp;m in it it touchdown is going to be tough to come back from as they would be down two scores &gt;&gt; kirk: the full back in the flat here, <person player="eric green" race="UNK" position="DB">green</person> tight end vertical &gt;&gt; mike: the tight end, he blocks they run off and with the quarterback, with randall! to the end zone! touchdown! very important extra point its an eightpoint game this extra point would make it two scores with 8:20 to go kicking into the wind with a wet ball out of the hold of robert beesly carter worley is true on the try and the hokies lead by nine! last possession, a mistake an interception down by the goal line what a great weapon to have a speedy quarterback &gt;&gt; mike: say nothing say nothing &gt;&gt; lee: exactly &gt;&gt; mike: virginia tech scored in each quarter here the hokies also known as the gobblers in the past, has a nickname, leading 287 well exexecuted drive by <person player="bryan randall" race="UNK" position="QB">randall</person> aggies got to be careful they catch it they dont! its free! did they recover inbounds? yes, they did, virginia tech ball! thats <person player="bryan randall" race="UNK" position="QB">bryan</person> mcpherson thquarterback, who was on the spot as the aggies have happened to them what happened to virginia tech about seven minutes ago <person player="byron jones" race="nonwhite" position="DB">byron</person> jones, the td &gt;&gt; kirk: a designed pooch by frank beamer positioned perfectly and, you know, thats one of those things where its like a video game trying to put that right there that was perfect by the kick &gt;&gt; mike: the clock has been running and put time on it if youre texas a&amp;m, you lost about 18 seconds &gt;&gt; lee: remember, last time virginia tech had the football, 11 runs hit both passes, 80 yards for a touchdown i would think theyd go at them, dont you? &gt;&gt; kirk: i think so &gt;&gt; mike: lets visit with rece davis in the studio for a moment &gt;&gt; rece: neil parry, san jose state, having his leg amputated below his right knee almost three years ago and returning to the field for the spartans against nevada but nevada on the board first injury last year and puts nevada up 70 and in the first quarter waiting for parry to get on the field &gt;&gt; mike: rece, you keep an eye on on that and let us know what an appearance we saw earlier before the show began reset the clock to 8:20 correctly the wind is the biggest impact tonight has been kicking into the wind has caused a couple of turnovers at one may cause tonight ball on the ground <person player="bryan randall" race="UNK" position="QB">randall</person> picked it up and his knee was down as he regained possession so it will be at the 34 and no gain clock runs inside of eight minutes and when that time says 000, off we go to "sportscenter" well talk about<person player="marcus vick" race="UNK" position="QB">marcus vick</person>in the shadow of brother mike who is out with the falcons from that preseason injury hoping to get back in about a month and check out other things and the play from last sunday that still haunts the 49ers they couldnt get timeout in time to kick a field goal in st louis and lost to the rams second and 11 evanones in the middle having a big night hes taken out of bounds that will help the aggies as jones gets inside the 30 &gt;&gt; lee: interesting beamer and his offensive staff must have said, okay, hardnosed football we got to run at them and test them theyve had 28 runs in five passes so far in the fourth quarter pretty good i mean in the second half nice strategy, i think, by beamer and his staff at halftime &gt;&gt; mike: look at the plays theyve run i think the aggies only run 16 plays this entire second half they were right at 40 i think at the break &gt;&gt; kirk: time of possession is just about even up when they were down 10, i think, at the half &gt;&gt; lee: yeah yeah &gt;&gt; mike: timeout by the hokies &gt;&gt; mike: virginia tech by nine while we have a second, to all of our guys, our camera operators who have survived the yao man there? in the rain and the wind there you go marshall, there gow at the guys, everybody, well ton thank you for your efforts in the rain before, during, and after the game to break down the pictures have been great and we appreciate it, as always college football thursday through anywhere, anytime third and eight virginia tech <person player="bryan randall" race="UNK" position="QB">randall</person> has five options he comes to jones going to be a couple of yards shy of a first down fourth down into the wind with a 42yard field goal &gt;&gt; lee: not me no, sir id go for it &gt;&gt; kirk: yeah aarp says that &gt;&gt; lee: the reason why if they block that field goal and get a chance to go even ifhey dont make it, leave the ball on the 20 yard line, 25 id go for it &gt;&gt; mike: youre at the back end of your kickers range as it is? good percentages from 40 plus ghshed &gt;&gt; kirk: run the option &gt;&gt; lee: if <person player="bryan randall" race="UNK" position="QB">randall</person> doesnt get it, jones does &gt;&gt; mike: fourth and two play pass to wilson first down,<person player="ernest wilford" race="UNK" position="WR">ernest wilford</person>its been a quiet night for their big receiver hes gotten a lot of the defensive attention, but they move the chains there and keep a drive alive &gt;&gt; lee: that was a nice call that time by the offensive line coach, <person player="brian patrick" race="UNK" position="DL">brian</person> stinespring they get a nice block by jones but to my receiver,<person player="ernest wilford" race="UNK" position="WR">ernest wilford</person>hes only one of the two tech athletes that gets the elite status in the off season this guy is a wonderful football player 19<person player="ernest wilford" race="UNK" position="WR">ernest wilford</person>he hasnt done much tonight buhes a good one &gt;&gt; mike: first catch of the night jones up the middle to the 11 yard line aggies have all of their timeouts left theyre down by nine we have saw the way the plays have changed its been a very intermittent half for <person player="reggie mcneal" race="UNK" position="QB">mcneal</person> and company 21 ratio has spun back around here in plays and runs &gt;&gt; kirk: not only downs but youre talking about the clock, biggest enemy for texas a&amp;m and picking up that first down, two or three minutes will be ticking off the clock for reggiecneal &gt;&gt; mike: toss, easlick, the full back, the block he he highsteps into the end zone! touchdown! third of the night &gt;&gt; lee: easlick, number 43 511", 238 pounds he blocks the outside contain and right there k he squatts40 pounds! &gt;&gt; kirk: is there a nice block to open it up but<person player="kevin jones" race="UNK" position="RB">kevin jones</person>is a story when it comes to running that football hes got the quickness and speed and once he picked up that big block by easlick, he got it in the secondary and now three touchdowns on the night &gt;&gt; mike: <person player="doug easlick" race="UNK" position="RB">easlick</person> has led the way a couple of times for one of the best nights in the career of<person player="kevin jones" race="UNK" position="RB">kevin jones</person>three touchdowns, as <person player="john kirk" race="UNK" position="OL">kirk</person> mentioned, 184 yards 184, his best equals a season high the touchdown was set up up by the kickoff that was short in the air a&amp;m has to go to a knee and theyll have it at their own 28 yard line &gt;&gt; jerry: the tennessee coaching staff was invited town to watch a&amp;m practice as the tennessee staff was in the locker room getting changed, they were introduce themselves to dennis franchione one of them said im shane beamer he said, wait a minute we play your dad you cant be here you got to get out of here shane had to ride the houston texans practice and he couldnt go to practice it was an innocent mistake frank beamer said if id a thought of it, i would have told shane not to head down there &gt;&gt; mike: shane a graduate assistant and be an assistant coach somewhere next year <person player="reggie mcneal" race="UNK" position="QB">mcneal</person> is rushed he is tied up by a db he is down theyre going to mark him back at the 12, bu<person player="nathaniel adibi" race="UNK" position="DL">nathaniel adibi</person>has the second sack of the season now they have salivating and heading for the quarterback &gt;&gt;

kirk: it seems like it he went through him he pushed him back there in the back field &gt;&gt; mike: on your mark, get set, go! good protection that time that one floated and intercepted! by darnell wild hell take it from mid field and there is the second aggie turnover of the night first one by the offense &gt;&gt; kirk: i know youre down by 16 points and on the road, 4:30 to go feels like the game is getting away from you but this is something a <person player="jacob young" race="UNK" position="P">young</person> quarterback can learn from hes just dropping back, waiting he just throws the football down field knowing, chances are, its going to get intercepted that was a lazy throw and a lazy decision by<person player="reggie mcneal" race="UNK" position="QB">reggie mcneal</person>when he looks at that with coach fran, hes going to learn a lot about decision making and being a <person player="jacob young" race="UNK" position="P">young</person> quarterback hell get better the guy has played well tonight and too bad he made that play &gt;&gt; mike: virginia tech leading by 16 jones trying to get to 200 here he gets two yards to the 45 yard line quite a night for the junior runner out of pennsylvania &gt;&gt; kirk: with lee suggs no longer being here,<person player="kevin jones" race="UNK" position="RB">kevin jones</person>is going to get more and more carries tonight, 188 yards and gotten better as the game has gone on second half, 67 yards in the third quarter, 59 yards in the fourth and used him in a variety of ways youve seen him in the shot gun on a misdirection and iformation powered in there behind the big full back<person player="kevin jones" race="UNK" position="RB">kevin jones</person>has credible versatility because of his speed and athletic ability &gt;&gt; lee: having said that, id keep him on the sideline the rest of the game, if i was frank boomer &gt;&gt; mike: the backup is in a yard<person player="blake kendrick" race="UNK" position="LB">blake kendrick</person>made the tack will hes wearing number 12 one of the walkons and dresses for the game gets to wear 12 representing the who student body i want you to scan the nation &gt;&gt;

kirk: <person player="anthony wright" race="UNK" position="WR">anthony</person> davis and greg jones at florida state is a great back &gt;&gt; mike: guys, here is<person player="marcus vick" race="UNK" position="QB">marcus vick</person>coming in the game as<person player="bryan randall" race="UNK" position="QB">bryan randall</person>gets a nice hand as he comes out jones ran for 188 and <person player="bryan randall" race="UNK" position="QB">randall</person> led the team quite well here is<person player="marcus vick" race="UNK" position="QB">marcus vick</person>hes been in for two drives this year, both ended up in touchdowns andomes in immediately and see the clock running down toward zero and calls for a timeout let them know they can see mike vicks brother coming up here in the last 2:30 of our game and "sportscenter" right after that talk about marcus and in mikes shadow shot light on the baseball stretch drive here just ten days or so left in the season and back to that 49ers play we saw earlier on well, we talk about in his brothers shadow his brother cast a huge shadow as wig big as the bleachers in this stadium this is physician his game when he had a spectacular touch jon and he did the spectacular two years here with amazing plays this one kept the champion season alive championship season alive in morgantown against the clock the retired number 7, mike vick, the numbers tell something 201 as a starter, getting to the title game all this, bottom lines to this mike <person player="marcus vick" race="UNK" position="QB">vick</person> made virginia tech cool and this became a cool place to go for a lot of the kids in that chess peek, newport news virginia area and after frank beamer laid a foundation, made this an elite program &gt;&gt; kirk: i think a lot of people assumed he would go to syracuse and be the next great quarterback up in syrase and he decid to go to virginia tech and started to make his own legacy and he did that &gt;&gt; mike: his brother marcus that play is not what they had hoped for it was a hole they lose a whole bunch of yardage there dropping back to the 46 &gt;&gt; lee: while were talking about contributions i think frank beamers contribution and legacy will be that end zone where theyve built it in and a new one coming on the lefthand side before he finishes and the fact theyre in the acc forget wins and losses and everything else he got a new stadium and in the acc frank beamers legacy will be wonderfully held right there ng l the there is franchiones team really had, i think, tech on the ropes controlled the first half but virginia tech has completely flipped it in the stats and the style of play here in the final 30 minutes &gt;&gt; lee: one thing for sure is aggies have to check on whats the matter in the second half they lost a big lead against utah and stopped them on the last play of the game &gt;&gt; kirk: you got 15 new starters i think maybe thats catching up to them i was impressed with what texas a&amp;m did considering the weather and so many new people coming into this game i think its going to be exciting to watch franchione to rebuild this program they could become a spoiler in the big 12 this year they did it last year against oklahoma as far as virginia tech went in, at halftime, frank beamer might have said lets go back to establishing the run and take over the line of scrimmage and get physical they went over 200 yards rushing in the second half alone thats virginia tech football &gt;&gt; lee: their defense kept the quarterback inside linebacker stuffed him nothing &gt;&gt; mike: reset the play clock here a reminder that "sportscenter" is coming up momentarily virginia tech plays kentucky here in nine days uconn husky team coached by randy etzel doing a fine job this year beat army earlier this year as well runs it out to the 40 fourth down and a timeout is called by the aggies &gt;&gt; lee: texas a&amp;m place pittsburgh pretty soon, dont they? &gt;&gt; kirk: i think next game &gt;&gt; mike: taking on the panthers in nine days as well that will be a good game you couldnt dont need to be a rocket scientist to figure out who is our wrangler player of the year kevin jones, 30 for a buck 88 and three scores and he was the ba, along with the oline, that controlled this second half we talk about virginia tech and jones lets look ahead to what they have as they take on kentucky and then march through the possible end of their stay in the big east with a big east championship &gt;&gt; kirk: a <person player="dustin long" race="UNK" position="QB">long</person> way to go for virginia tech e first game, miami at home helps them but on the road, in places like west virginia, pittsburgh, end of the year at virginia, a rivalry game virginia tech is going to have to continue to improve in every aspect if they can sfriv survive that schedule miami at home had a lot to do why i thought virginia tech had a chance to get for to the national championship &gt;&gt; lee: i think theyll beat miami and letdown at pittsburgh who has beaten them twice in a row &gt;&gt; mike: hard to play those games backtoback &gt;&gt; kirk: jones, his health is paramount theyre going it hand the ball to him 25, 30 times a game, hes got to stay healthy &gt;&gt; mike: hokies kick the ball away it is<person player="jason carter" race="UNK" position="QB">jason carter</person>on the return he gets it out to about the 25 yard line is that the punter <person player="vinnie burns" race="UNK" position="P">burns</person> down there making the play? that is the deepest penetration usually when your punter playing center field <person player="vinnie burns" race="UNK" position="P">burns</person> stuck his head in there and made the tackle virginia tech will continue to move on in their preoctober schedule with great success 27 straight wins here in the opening couple of months of the season lee, you talked about it this program, frank beamers legacy moving to the acc absolutely the right thing at the end of the day, the way it happened was funny funny funny governor warner was going to be here tonight to take a victory lap and try to stop by and get on national tv sacked and good <person player="jacob young" race="UNK" position="P">young</person> end we talked about earlier the governor was going to take a victory lap i wish he would have come for that victory lap i want to know if he forced the virginia vote that ended up turning the day and getting virginia tech in the acc a joke going around and he made more policy in the ncaa and more impact on college athletics than anyone in the last off season it is the end of the day the right move they fit in the acc and i think it will be a very good recruiting fit for them as they go check out the athletes in north carolina &gt;&gt; kirk: months ago when this story first broke about miami possibly taking syracuse from boston college my first reaction is ill have to believe you have to see it to believe it how can you overlook virginia tech as a possibility of joining miami? and it was all said and done whatever happened behind the scenes, virginia tech gets their opportunity to go to the acc &gt;&gt; mike: the pass could be the last pass of the play of the game &gt;&gt; lee: my picks, taken them all to the acc and then you got yourself one heck of a league &gt;&gt; mike: timeout taken by a&amp;m it was nice as they were moving heaven and earth to make it an even 12 but keep the ú■ &gt;&gt;
