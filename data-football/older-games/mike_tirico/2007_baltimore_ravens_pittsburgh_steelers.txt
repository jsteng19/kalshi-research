============================================================

hi in pittsburgh for tonight layana the best steelers in the last 75 years and this year s good evening everyone we welcome you to monday night football things worked out so far so good for 35 year old head coach mike tomlin in his rookie year he has the steelers at five and two atop the division he s following a familiar blueprint in these parts run the ball pretty well as one appropriate tenacious defense pittsburgh atop a division one last year five baltimore baltimore was 13 and three last year theyve already lost three games and their four wins they havent beaten anybody who s all that good to be honest theyre good news they get <person player="steve mcnair" race="nonwhite" position="QB">steve mcnair</person> back after their veteran quarterback has missed the last couple of weeks joined up here in the booth by tony kornheiser and ron jaworski on a rainy night in western pennsylvania and that fits the mood because we always talk about the running backs the quarterbacks the offense if you love defense you go to a really good place tonight mike this matchup is not for the faint of heart whenever the ravens and the steelers get together it s about smash mouth football they might as well just meet at the 50yard line and start swinging right now and see who was left standing when you look at rex ryan the defensive quarter for the ravens he loves the rent space and a quarterbacks mind with everchanging schemes to cause confusion last season against the steelers that ravens defense had 14 sacks against <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> and seven times they had a clean shot at big fan himself and then when you think about the steelers and smash mouth football it may have been vented right here in pittsburgh in the 70s with the steel curtain defense and a lot of them will be here tonight but dick lebeau the defense coordinator now has taken this defense to another level they blitz one out of every three snaps yes it is the blitz bird defense and mike if youre <person player="steve mcnair" race="nonwhite" position="QB">steve mcnair</person> or <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> tonight you better have your head on a swivel because the blitz is coming you see the steelers and the throw backs it s a game defined by defense where an appropriate night tony as they honor 75 seasons of steeler football absolutely look around this stadium tonight and you will see the ghosts of steelers past chuck knowles legendary steel curtain teams who won four super bowls in six years bradshaw and swan and stallworth and franco and many more the steelers celebrate their 75th season it s appropriate to note that the most honored dynasty of the super bowl era played right here in pittsburgh not the cowboys of 8 minerva nenana 2 1 3 not the redskins of joe gibbs the first time around who won three with three different quarterbacks not the 49ers bill walsh built who eventually won five with montana and young both finding jerry rice whenever they had to knock shoeless undefeated dolphins and not yet the patriots of belichick and brady were at three encounter no it s the steelers of north and bradshaw and webster and plugs and lambert and ham and mean joe <person player="justin green" race="UNK" position="RB">green</person> there s a hall of fame here tonight this is the most celebrated of all the super bowl dynasties those tough men playing in this rough city of blue collars and steel mills of lunch pails and hard hats this is a city where football was born and meant to be played and those are the men who gave life to that myth and we can now stand tall against the steel city skyline like giants in the earth as today s steelers are introduced a lot of yesterday s steelers are here well visit with them as the night goes on as we set the table for ravens steelers this telecast is available in high definition on espn hd presented by dlp hdtv for the story of both quarterbacks we send it down to the soggy sideline michele tafoya on pittsburgh in a second first suzy kolber on the return of <person player="steve mcnair" race="nonwhite" position="QB">steve mcnair</person> to playback from a laundry list of major injuries that this season has been one of his toughest that s because the groin injury he suffered on monday night football and we had such an effect on his entire body they destroyed his mechanics to the point he couldnt compete but knowing the smartest thing he could do was let his body heal he sat out two games plus had the bye week so he returns feeling fresh and focused and what perfect timing mcnary s belated a steelers killer from 98 to 2003 the starter and in relief he helped heat the steelers 9 out of 11 times and it continued last season with the ravens michelle <person player="steve mcnair" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnair</person> was a perfect to pursue well in those two losses to the ravens last year <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> through 44 interceptions and was sacked a walloping 14 times tonight as painful as it may be <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> would much rather be sack than intercepted the steelers want to avoid turnovers at all cost considering this season wofford has thrown four interceptions in the five wounds he s thrown just to told us he has to play smart he said a punt is one of the best plays we can have and if i have to take a sack take the sack we cannot turn the ball over mike and michelle in our alltel headtohead you will see the career records for both quarterbacks against these teams but there s 15 start against the steelers big ben sabbath against baltimore i can still remember that cold night under moonlight sick we didnt like each other very much in the first place we didnt play to win i can still feel the state it s always been the same you can see the you that s why they call it smash mouth those are the games you remember the ones for his plane and once played in these parts for quite some time whether the old which became the baltimore ravens or the current ones and it is appropriate that is raining we have so much rain the players didnt get on the field for their early warmup it s a windblown rain right now and that wind might be more of a factor than the rain is as the night goes on because this seems to be the back line of the showers that s rees <person player="rhys lloyd" race="white" position="K">lloyd</person> who is going to kick off <person player="matt stover" race="white" position="K">matt stover</person> is active boyd likely to kick off tonight and has kicked off rolling for the sidelines has finally picked up by non c√® devonport up the steelers and in burbank uniforms he takes it to the 31yard line the game begins there so here comes the baltimore ravens defense and they are a big part of the story as we alluded to before <person player="ray lewis" race="nonwhite" position="LB">ray lewis</person> is crew is missing some of the guys who helped so much samara roll the tenth year quarterback who s been to the throw ball he s been out with a spleen injury that has been bothering him for a couple of games now missing this fourth game and chris mcallister the threetime probowler is that with the right knee injuries of derek <person player="derrick martin" race="nonwhite" position="DB">martin</person> <person player="corey ivy" race="nonwhite" position="DB">corey</person> iv started at the corners tonight but i without his shirt is insane and he s out of here by halftime on a stretcher <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> and the steelers going into the wind <person player="willie parker" race="nonwhite" position="RB">willie parker</person> the calories gain of about two <person player="ray lewis" race="nonwhite" position="LB">ray lewis</person> right there to make the tackle her ovens defense is very good against the run only giving up two point nine yards per attempt that s the best in the national football league going into the weekend <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> the 11th overall pick in the draft in 2004 his fourth year out of miami of ohio has bounced back for disappointing season in o six with a good performance thus far and the starch from the crowd has been taken out as some of the heaviest rain of the night comes in sheets from left to right that she loves and the stickers go empty surprising <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> goes down as room rosing stinson <person player="hines ward" race="nonwhite" position="WR">hines ward</person> convinced the 46 for the first down game 15 why i say surprising the rain is coming down in sheets right now and with ben with no one in the backfield he s gotta throw the football youll see him on the 3step drop trying to get the ball out of his hand but quick pressure ben has been outstanding outside the pocket this season outside the hash marks 47 throws 27 completions both those numbers are the most in the national football league so ben likes to move and get out of the rush basically marked at the 47 first first down of the game carrie <person player="carey davis" race="nonwhite" position="RB">davis</person> leading the way it sparked her to the left snatch space the second tie they could not get any leverage and he s brought down by <person player="terrell suggs" race="nonwhite" position="DE">terrell suggs</person> you saw the good numbers for <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> this year 15 touchdowns 6 interceptions is all of 102 point to rating there s a change it coach with the steelers and people say that s the biggest change i say the biggest change is in karma they have bad karma last year this year s falcons the last year steelers it started with <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> s motorcycle accident then it s appendectomy that is concussion they got off to a two and six start theyre five and two now because he is physically right and the pharma is better for this team second and 11 driving rain again no backs they try the quick shot it is caught by <person player="hines ward" race="nonwhite" position="WR">hines ward</person> was going to lose a yard and a half is benton suisun us to the offense that tries to pick up third as well alright the guy that s got my back at left tackle marbella smith the leader of the line left guard alabama as center number 61 shawn mayhem at right guard from auburn <person player="kendall simmons" race="UNK" position="OG">kendall simmons</person> and the young buck of the line at right tackle willie cologne of course everyone knows without a bunch of other playmakers

dairy and the claims only going to about a yard one of the headlines for mcmahon returning is also the offensive line returns three significant parts that have been out the last week mike youre

player="steve mcnair" race="nonwhite" position="QB">steve</person> can do is keep the play alive extend the plate and once again he s outside the hash and so far this season outside the hatch he s

early in the game to say this jaws but do you think the steelers are playing like they remember what happened last year when they got beat 27 nothing and 31 seven by baltimore and youll see the steelers defense in what they called their sugar and buffle they called it a creep tony and i didnt mean it was about you and buffalo s the creep they called it a sugar here in pittsburgh where all those guys stand up on the line of scrimmage on the defense sam cooke with big cakey very nice pinning <person player="alan faneca" race="white" position="OG">alan</person> ross to decide by the 51 yard kick from the 25 nice room for awesome brought down at the 36 by <person player="prescott burgess" race="nonwhite" position="LB">prescott burgess</person> the young lie backer for the ravens we have a penalty marker down back near the spot of the kick to see yards past the live scrimmage 9 plays nine yards thus far for lucis smith and the rest of the ravens offense they look bewildered during a posture holding number 50 for the receiving team that 10yard penalty will be enforced from where the kick was caught this bird keeps the ball first down <person player="andre frazier" race="nonwhite" position="LB">andre frazier</person> with the flags it s where it s caught so it goes back inside the 20 thus far nine plays and a whole bunch of hits on number nine brian billick coming over to talk with his veteran quarterback <person player="steve mcnair" race="nonwhite" position="QB">steve mcnair</person> remember <person player="steve mcnair" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnair</person> missed the last two games with his injury and off week last week so <person player="steve mcnair" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnair</person> seeing the field for a first time in a month time the steeler fans crammed in will see their team have to go 85 yards the penalty takes <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> on the offense back to the 15th we parker publix running gets about three to the 18 yard line we know that <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> started out 13 a know best start by a rookie the youngest quarterback to win a super bowl although we only completed nine passes in super bowl xlviii a win over seattle in detroit and then tony jumped left the bag farm of the problems last year but we would <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> fit as a profile for a quarterback right now after spending some time weve been on saturday one thing i feel about him he is very comfortable now within his own skin within this offense and with bruce arians who s a defensive coordinator putting this off and together he is a very strong comfort level right now second and seven ben sees no press conference against <person player="hines ward" race="nonwhite" position="WR">hines ward</person> throws to him with third and supe <person player="cory ross" race="UNK" position="RB">cory</person> ivey made the tackle come back to the first part where he said in his own skin first the leadership they she had a better no question about it he s become a leader on his football team you said his fourth year he now has matured as an nfl quarterback the players in that offense looked to him for leadership from upon field stand for you i still believe ben is outstanding in the play action game and if the first receiver comes open i still dont believe he processed information quickly to get his other options and stay with that progression he likes to bolt out of the pocket and why not be very good at it theyll do third and two out of the gun especially comes someone scott then you get out of there but a flag down by the password holding offense number 73 the pairing is declined bridge up fourth down right guard <person player="kendall simmons" race="UNK" position="OG">kendall simmons</person> <person player="bart scott" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bart scott</person> busting in held them and pittsburgh will punt it away when you get in those third down situations against the ravens they like to attack your protection schemes weve already heard it twice and coming into this game 14 sacks in the two games last year the ravens had against <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> theyre not always on the quarterback theyre against your protection schemes rex ryan the defense pointer does a really good job of breaking down your protections come on figures punt return for touchdown camp against arizona we have a penalty marker down on the 49yard punt and mm ow as figures as question the head at the 35 yard line by foot spreewald the linebacker and <person player="james harrison" race="nonwhite" position="LB">james harrison</person> we have multiple fouls on this play and i dont think either of the calls was on harris number 97 of the kicking team was illegally downfield before the kick fiveyard penalty but theyre like five words there s another foul oculi as he runs over to the other foul wait a minute ive got more one more we have an amusement park have you been sitting on that line okay i just want to wake tony up im up you get it tony i get it all right <person player="james harrison" race="nonwhite" position="LB">james harrison</person> was whistled for thee for our no harrison this whistle for the first flag <person player="james harrison" race="nonwhite" position="LB">james harrison</person> was the one on the head and baltimore may have pittsburgh ridiculous one as hercules sorts it out there s the harrison hit there was a flag down near the catch before that sound and then we had two hats thrown by officials who once youre at a flags you throw your hat for a penalty these poor folks sitting in the rain rain to win this movie tell us what s going on and let s go the referee it hercule goes over to brian billick to give him his options neat greeting brian s lips he said 15 more yards so you seen the option oculi doesnt want this game to go too long because he s got a date at the gym where he can do pushups he s sick and get even bigger by midnight so he wants to move the game yeah he s not real happy as to where those long sleeves today that s football right there look at this guy man no that s lance no that s football tony youre know a hotbed of football right here is where it started fans are into it there were followed by both teams on the play there was an ineligible downfield by the kicking team there was also a personal foul during the kick by rule and option at three kick replay fourth down and that s what the team has chosen its fourth down at the previous spot most well done now i understand it so none of that happened were back to daniel s suppose another rookie out of baylor kicking and this time <person player="ed reed" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ed reed</person> goes back we saw reed and take a punt back 63 yards on opening night in cincinnati <person player="daniel sepulveda" race="white" position="P">sepulveda</person> this hits this one scooter 32 he s one more block to turn the corner <person player="lawrence timmons" race="nonwhite" position="LB">timmons</person> and florida state i think that flag is a block in the back reid having the ball pop up in the air the contact by <person player="andre frazier" race="nonwhite" position="LB">andre frazier</person> is going to lose it and harrison was there as well again it was genius james here s a once again to helmet weight on the football political tackling james harris it causes another turnover during the return illegal block in the back by baltimore number 81 whispers keeps the ball first down llaman figures had struggled with returns he had fumbled a couple of times took the high hit from <person player="james harrison" race="nonwhite" position="LB">james harrison</person> so it read goes back read made a really tough borderline decision on that bouncing ball to pick it up he secured it had a

defensive coordinator didnt go to a tomlin new is to tampa t defense statement for those three four and the steelers defense paying dividends leading the league in points laying the yards allowed thus far this year second mate harrison post another turnover here turnover mcgee he s got it trying to keep the plan alive in the board of safety and harrison brings him down forward progress well keep that for being sick so he stuck inside the one it is the <person player="james harrison" race="nonwhite" position="LB">james harrison</person> night in the first 20 minutes of the game he is a defensive piece that that would be the term mike tomlin very happy to play at the <person player="james harrison" race="nonwhite" position="LB">james harrison</person> youll see him right here from the stand up linebacker position he s actually doubleteamed to start the play he beats the tackle <person player="jason brown" race="UNK" position="C">jason brown</person> reach the tackle time to add them great pressure on <person player="steve mcnair" race="nonwhite" position="QB">steve mcnair</person> causing another fumble this is you know this is turning into what a homecoming game means it s like the steelers handpicked the opponent because theyre celebrating 75 years and baltimore is doing everything it can to make this totally joyful for pittsburgh and taking themselves out of contention for the playoffs icahn fans very frustrated that was the safety that s the correct call there s the forward progress of <person player="willis mcgahee" race="nonwhite" position="RB">mcgahee</person> then he got pushed straight back third quarter of the field lady anymore pence after dishes to the gold there s nothing to add to that it s just awful saunas the three

meeting at the point of downtown pittsburgh 21nothing steelers and <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> looking for a first down home run for <person player="santonio holmes" race="nonwhite" position="WR">santonio holmes</person> first single was touchdown then it was pulled away by choreography simultaneous possession belongs to the offense the officials still having a conversation being incomplete now official went up with the touchdown signal <person player="santonio holmes" race="nonwhite" position="WR">holmes</person> and i be both go up for the football the bar really has to maintain continuous to the ground first part of it hockey leaves words where the receiver lost the ball got it there it s coming out as he comes down the question is just never hit the ground to be an incomplete pass yes the ball is on the ground he did not maintain possession through the catch which you must do in the endzone you see it s like ill tell you what that s a great recall of that play because that is really slowed down with seven looks like until we figured out that was the right call as a fabulous job parker left side games for to the 45 there are two people in the stands here are thinking to themselves i too held that and i think their swan and stalking that could have been the rare combo challenge where we both think we have won two challenges one well theyre picking on the corners <person player="corey ivy" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ivy</person> and derek <person player="derrick martin" race="nonwhite"

gets away from <person player="terrell suggs" race="nonwhite" position="DE">terrell suggs</person> look at the eyes down field looking for receiver this is what s called extending the play folks and that is doing it very well you have made the point about him that he s one of the quarterbacks who doesnt ever want to run he wants to throw in that position he s not looking maybe like tom brady would to pick up additional yardage by running well i think brady claws him in the same hole i think brady likes to move the mobility to control the football <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> figure and stronger doesnt let you to get outside the pocket parker games to second and eight to the 33 coming it s late on the pile here with a lot of guys unhappy now mike tomlin takes over as the head coach and you teach with the offensive coordinator penguins hut becomes marisa head coach bruce arians takes over there you see bruce as the offensive coordinator what s it been like the relationship between aryans have been <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> on that s been outstanding you know at first when marion s this year the last couple years they develop and foster a relationship and now you can see theyre working together benz much more involved in the game film comes in on tuesday and spends time developing the game plan parker tried to run to the right and the park scott was able get in there and make the tackle for a loss of a couple of yards areas on this staff and mike tomlin had a brief history but an understanding of bruce arians it was very comfortable with turning the offense over to him as the offensive coordinator his whisenhunt and russ grimm both potential head coach candidates here russ trip many thought would go twas going to get the job they were on the offensive side of the ball aryans and <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> together that input the communication have hit it off right from the start so important when you have a coaching change how the coordinator and the quarterback

pittsburgh let s his halftime show chris love as fast as three minutes and mister kornheiser mister will bomb will have pardon the interruption here in pittsburgh granthi good for pti at the half tony

washington" race="nonwhite" position="WR">washington</person> his second 34 to nothing here s baltimore s problem in one half then rob this burger has the same amount of touchdown passes that

here <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> on the fake booty out away from the toss looked over the middle of field first but knows he s got the outside receiver open does a terrific job it s <person player="cedrick wilson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">wilson</person> for the touchdown greed for the extra point pittsburgh steelers embarrassing the baltimore ravens the way they were embarrassed last year for polymer turnovers and turned into for pittsburgh touchdowns ravens have never had a firsthalf like this terms given a point since brian billick took over this team he s 19 that s returned by <person player="musa smith" race="UNK" position="RB">musa</person> slip former georgia bulldog gives the only bit of life fighting all the way through on that one awesome as he s taken out by midfield hands exchanged up by the face gear awesome walking away with guilty shoulders and the officials are going to really have to do a job of policing this because the frustrated ravens have been in conversation after every play mike i concur with you this is cheap shot personal foul face mask by the kicking team number 30 15yard penalty from the end of the run first down let s go down to suzy kolber on the ravens sideline mike you know those commercials you want to get away to the sideline after that last interception and their fourth turnover for the ravens earlier in the game you would at least come over shake his head talk to coaches this last time he simply looked numb but that has been the demeanor of the offense and not the defense believe it or not these guys are still very animated and read specifically waive cameras and mike s away so he can give an impassioned speech to his guys waving we can still do this <person player="terrell suggs" race="nonwhite" position="DE">terrell suggs</person> hitting everybody slapping the other hand despite the school especially reid and luis it fits right into their profile they have always been like that you would not expect any professional to give up on a game because everybody has seen the strangest things happen but especially those guys mike when all is said and done right now for the ravens more is being said than done tends to get on the board here taking over any pittsburgh territory for 33 <person player="steve mcnair" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnair</person> gets mcgehee gets a crease breaks a tackle and scores a touchdown so the gainey scores from 33 yards out to end the shutout and maybe 35 6 excellent burst by <person

personal south flag not <person player="demetrius williams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">williams</person> those of you just tuning in here at the top of the hour and seeing the score it is a shocker

a been on the field because i just love him so much mike they were very close players and coaches are always close in college especially when it s a quarterback and it s a successful player but i was around the miami of ohio team a lot in that year that <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> helped lead him to a great season and their relationship was unique and special and suzie was backstage at the draft if you remember <person player="adam terry" race="UNK" position="OT">terry</person> heppner sitting at <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> s table and his team s past <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> in that first round before pick 11 hepner visibly anchored banging the table in his frustration after the loss of the nine yards <person player="najeh davenport" race="nonwhite" position="RB">davenport</person> has brought down inbound so the ravens are forced to stop it with the ball at the 39 yard line well have third and about 16 coming up and so often ron we talk about players in the exo aspect of it of their maturity and for <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> the motorcycle accident the 20 alluded to and all the tough times last year yeah i got the sense from ben of a guy who i guess had his life jolted by everything around him not just to him personally but also to somebody so close as mentor like kepner and it seems to be a refocusing moment for him for this season and he s performed that way on the field oh i agree and things came very fast for <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> that rookie year

codrington and sakyo beca 10round showdown who will be the champion of the contender the season finale live from boston codrington bika on espn 9 eastern tomorrow to a great year of the contender and that wraps up tomorrow but this is a fight tonight it would be a tko the ravens would be no timeouts 53 seconds left the ravens just trying to get a position to get something else on the board of <person player="mark clayton" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mark</person> twain having to quit while weve been talking about the short quick passing game of the ravens and it s surprising me they come out here and theyve got a long way to go and it s long feel they throw five yards pass just not going to move the ball down the field theyre gonna have to take their shots think protection first run a couple two we see the routes and throw the ball down the field get <person player="steve mcnair" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnair</person> a little bit of time i know mccarran love to have that guy <person player="todd heap" race="white" position="TE">todd heap</person> he s out for tonight s game an outstanding they made in the seats of essentially missing his fourth the pressure on the gear brought down the <person player="james harrison" race="nonwhite" position="LB">james harrison</person> could continue he had to share that with clark hagen oh it might be only half sack for him there harrison has been a superstar tonight once again harrison coming around the outside he s being blocked by <person player="jonathan ogden" race="UNK" position="OT">jonathan ogden</person> <person player="jonathan ogden" race="UNK" position="OT">jonathan ogden</person> cant even hold him back one of the best tackles the national football league harrison is having his way here in the first half it is a human highlight film hell share the sack half a sack apiece for harrison and hagen s his tackles and forced fumbles false start offense number 78 that file also requires a 10second run off that half is over no time out so when you have a motion presnap flag inside of ten seconds it runs up ten and a half mercifully ends for the ravens who get the ball first trailing thirty five to seven as we said this to chris bergen for the lexus halftime show all right michael thank you what a fitting way to end that half 75th anniversary celebration for the steelers pretty good and the steelers saying it s everybody that says the afc is patriots colt a wait a minute what about me and it looks as if tonight barring a miracle quoth the raven nevermore but yesterday requiem for a pair of heavyweights undefeated new england and undefeated indianapolis who wore their championship ring into the belt their belt into the ring it was as much an anticipated regular season showdown as weve seen in a long time who knew that the first sunday of november would also include a pair of records set in another dome we begin our fastest three minutes with super bowl 41 and a half patriots veterans tedy bruschi company fired up peyton manning colts sam weve won 12 straight defense colts early laid the lumber on to england and late in the first half little dump pass from peyton manning

run the table and both of the teams playing here tonight are on their schedule you see either the ravens or the steelers feeding the patriots well i think im asleep and seeing the ravens have been eliminated from this discussion with the first half they put it tony you know ive told you all along people are overlooking the steeler they know how to hit somebody in the mouth and they have enough offense to contend either with the patriots we saw what the defense did at least hell the patriots and check your stripe the steelers can do that yeah now you know that i dont think anybody is going to be here though until maybe the playoffs but what you lies about the steelers that game is in new england clearly the steelers can play in whether theyve got no plague <person player="lee vickers"

the first half adrian peterson tony land for 296 yards yesterday and now nearly 400 yards more than a damien thomlinson on the season tony i think peterson is the best back in the nfl already do you well he certainly was yesterday i mean im reluctant after just eight games to say that it would be the number seven pick is the best back in the nfl if he s at great wide six teams pass on but he s got yardage and he s got blinding speed i just thought the emmitt smith was an authority on this times he is and he said this guy s son thinks he s never seen also said if he learns how to fall and if the vikings get a passing game this guy s the remedy could be the best back tony since emmitt and barry were in their prime i think he s right there wow maybe beat notre dame on saturday to drop the irish to one and eight but <person player="charlie batch" race="nonwhite" position="QB">charlie</person> weis said on sunday quote im gonna be here a long time unfroze iii will dawn tony it depends on

small school aw shucks kid fourtime super bowl champ <person player="dennis haley" race="UNK" position="LB">dennis</person> lynn swann john stallworth betty cunningham the defensive guys for steal it great what a team photo almost no franchise can match i said to you tony s were watching was kind of like watching oldtimers day for the yankees because every guy who gets introduced halloffamer multiple champion think of the number of championship rings down on that field as they get lined across midfield what a treat to watch let s not forget that of all the great dynasties in the super bowl era this is the number one the steel curtain teams and they just amplify those with teams that have come after that and you know what is amazing about this people around the country like the pittsburgh steelers they like the fact that they play tough football in a tough city is not new york team not a los angeles team of chicago team a boston team no red sox nation situation this is familyowned the tough theyre durable they have tradition stability and continuity and might you know this that everywhere you go you find steeler fans they travel well people like them and they believe that this is the kind of city where the right kind of footballs play oh my gosh just just around town guys from canada who had never come to see the steelers in person from new brunswick and you see so many of the faces that are familiar to the folks who are still around this franchise the hugs the smiles it s been a real unique sight josh and mike you know i think tony s right you know you like these guys i played against a lot of it it beat me up pretty good you know but i saw him down the field before the game saw him up here in the press box and you do genuinely like these guys they played the game the right way they represented their community the right way and they have a great passion for the game and this city has had such a wonderful history of precision and these uniforms tonight notwithstanding the steelers about the same uniforms for many years the same logo for a million years theyre not the dallas cowboys who as many people hate as love theyre not a flashy team football s not a flashy sport theyre theyre sort of the bedrock old school circumstance in a sport that really admires that and i think theyre the one organization in the nfl that just about everybody likes except maybe people from cleveland i before letter worth you it s ohio and i get that part but youre always struck by how well they travel and how much people s admire their accomplishments and respect the way they play and they were dominant in the first half thirty five to seven baltimore will get the ball first to start the third and reid kicks some yousuf smith who takes it from the six takes it to twentyfive years in chicago on the ravens side watch mike walking in with brian billick at halftime and said tim coach i never asked what are you gonna say to your team at halftime but what are you gonna say to your team at halftime and he said im gonna say guys win or lose what kind of a team do we want to be win or lose what kind of men do we want to be and i asked him how you gonna get your quarterback any kind of time at all and said you know we hadnt given up a sack and three previous games but tonight three sacks so first and foremost we have to find a way to protect our quarterback <person player="steve mcnair" race="nonwhite" position="QB">steve mcnair</person> who s been southwest any time starts it with a team game likes good on that side like i said mike tomlin what on earth do you say to a team when youre a pike this kind of score at halftime and he said we still havent done what we set out to do the more vital team is gonna win this game we have to hit them in the mouth repeatedly im not trying to downplay what weve done but we still have to be the more violent team weve had flashy plays bennigan s been great but we have to be the more violent team like that is exactly a refrain of what tomlin was saying to us on saturday in terms of setting a tone for his team for tonight second down <person player="steve mcnair" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnair</person> checks it down team the game e harrison slips falls james the star of the game gets up makes the play itll be 34 now i have one question do we just have one hat did susie get the hat or michelle get it did she have it in the first half that was a cool monday night football happened we only had one happen there you see the stats for the first half as onesided as it was with pittsburgh s two losses to baltimore last year eight penalties for turnover hope their revenge game is worth one of the truth i went shoes in my hat if it is that it wanted

started in their own territory for started in pittsburgh territory in baltimore territory the other one started right at midfield one of the things that made the ravens so good last year if im not mistaken was their take away great take away give away ratio they were plus 17 they were plus two going into this game so now they would be 2 and so you can be 13 and 3 when youre getting the ball back all the time but you can 332 3 when youre giving it away im glad that university of binghamton education work for university marked it down after sapulpa is 51 yard kick and reed gets no return

michele tafoya yeah when you think that the steel curtain mike you think of guys like lambert and you think of me and joe greene you think of jack and you think of mel blanc mel it s nice to see it what what do you make of the defensive performance youre seeing by this dealers tonight pretty impressive it s good to see i think theyre just carrying on the tradition of still the defense well <person player="james harrison" race="nonwhite" position="LB">james harrison</person> is having quite a night would you have expected this coming in well i knew they would play well john harrison has always been a great player and weve got great linebackers and breakdown on our defense so i thought we could play an antibody in the national football league our defense about the offensive performance youre seen by the ravens though this is a little bit surprising granted the defense of the steelers has been very very good but what do you make of this offense well i tell you what it s kind of embarrassing to think that youre in the professional leagues and you cant perform any better than that granted the still is a tough defense but it s pretty pathetic you played because of your physical style of play a lot of the rules changed and now it seems that safeties are really the more physical players in the defensive backfield guys like <person player="jeff reed" race="white" position="K">jeff</person> omalley bob sanders every defensive backfield i think we have great out police in the secondary throughout the national football league always good guys and say that s where your great athletes are but you right we we believe right now that safety play in the nfl is very important because those guys have to be able to read see what s happening and they have to be able to come up and make plays and we got a great player he and <person player="troy polamalu" race="nonwhite" position="DB">troy polamalu</person> yeah indeed you do hey it s nice to visit with you thanks

few years ago and he s signed for an extra year at what point does brian billick say to <person player="steve mcnair" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnair</person> it s not your night kid and were free and involved you should have done it already in my opinion yeah all right youve got it youre down thirty five to seven in this game if you have a chance come back you cant be a check down quarterback we got to think touchdown check down not check down check down check down he s not looking downfield for plays got caught up in this increasing wind it s only a 30 yarder and down by jajuan lands really hard wind coming left to right now here in pittsburgh there is dan rooney chairman of steelers 51st year president of the organization from life it s been the part of the family business going back to the chief his dad art founder of the steelers who died in 1988 87 both hall of famers now j <person player="najeh davenport" race="nonwhite" position="RB">davenport</person> the first down run about five yards and because of mr rooney the rooney rule went into effect in the national football league that was to throw by already hiring for head coaching jobs and making it mandatory for nfl teams to have a minority candidate as an interview in the process what a job opens up and after a couple of interviews mike tomlin was brought in for the interview with pittsburgh and many thought that would be just satisfying the rooney rule and the irony of all ironies the rooney s were blown away by mike tomlin in the interview process said after one year as a coordinator with minnesota tomlin at age 35 takes over the steelers job <person player="najeh davenport" race="nonwhite" position="RB">davenport</person> runs right looses maybe three itll be third date coming up it s the steelers history something all i believed was 37 when he was given a job had been a defensive coach comes the head coach of the steelers stays for 100 years bill cowher was 34 when he got the job here stayed for 15 years defensive assistant mike tomlin was actually 34 when he was hired and he s 35 down so while it seemed like an odd choice because mike tomlin comes in out of nowhere he actually appears to be cut from the same bolt of clock as all those other guys but he also walks in to a great job as a firstyear head coach great job see that won the super bowl two seasons ago 37 <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> was the quarterback puts this one up <person player="santonio holmes" race="nonwhite" position="WR">santonio holmes</person> makes a man miss and homeschools to the 9 yard line the ball comes out <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> might be shaken up on the play as he s down by the sideline as the paul came out let s see what the ruling is in the steel that means to catch the balls down there but back to <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> who as he rolled out took the shot about 45 yard gain and he s down on the sideline he been once again extending the play for l <person player="terrell suggs" race="nonwhite" position="DE">suggs</person> come up and pushes him to the sideline that s that right arm extended as he slides down so as they look at <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> steelers quarterback he s thrown five touchdown passes tonight shaken up timeout <person player="charlie batch" race="nonwhite" position="QB">charlie batch</person> pittsburgh native getting set to come in some concern steelers around their quarterback <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> s now sitting up let s take you to the play real speed youll see <person player="terrell suggs" race="nonwhite" position="DE">terrell suggs</person> come in meet willy cologne nothing dirty about the play and then as <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> goes down reaching from the back and hip area on down nothing it looks very obvious there and now <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> getting up and very very gingerly being assisted toward the bench of the steelers certainly never know until an mri is done this further exam but certainly that does not look good right out of the gate and what looked to be a relatively innocent play relative to the violence of this game thirty five seven game you really dont like to see your quarterback go down id let anybody go down but he s having the greatest game of his career not telling the super bowl where he was the victorious quarterback but in terms of statistics five touchdown passes in the first half greatest game of his career see him walk off like that i said the parma had changed we hope it doesnt revert that the students want us to go but it was probably one of the worst ones on gavinporter de terre <person player="charlie batch" race="nonwhite" position="QB">charlie</person> bachelor 535 seven with twenty one minutes left and so many people have postulated when the patriots have gotten up big well why is brady in the game late in the fourth quarter etcetera etcetera here we are in the middle of the third curve so he s certainly gonna leave you starting that s on question right now also if you on the replay which weve now seen twelve claims in this booth it looks fairly benign right i mean it looks like it s not a dirty play by any stretch imagination he looks to have fallen on his knee first and not even still sort of surprised that he grabbed his hip sucks who s involved in the <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> play goes out holding his knee that place so back the group ten minutes in the stadium here ill play action throws to the fullback and it s incomplete was one career rushing touchdown separated from the second score by <person player="ray lewis" race="nonwhite" position="LB">ray lewis</person> well looked like crider dropped the ball before a rain <person player="ray lewis" race="nonwhite" position="LB">lewis</person> got there <person player="charlie batch" race="nonwhite" position="QB">charlie</person> had a nice play action fake here at strider wide opening the fat flat <person player="ray lewis" race="nonwhite" position="LB">ray lewis</person> little late getting out there crowder just dropped the ball of course he s a big old blocking fullback there in the ball was a little bit behind them but no guy that size is pretty hard to turn here turn your hips around at 255 pounds <person player="terrell suggs" race="nonwhite" position="DE">suggs</person> went down on that play before remember he s the one who injured <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> it was just a collision no cheap shot no dirty stuff on that play where <person player="terrell suggs" race="nonwhite" position="DE">suggs</person> got hurt a moment ago for bats out of eastern michigan in ypsilanti throws it away and itll be fourth down thirtyfive seven that believe the fieldgoal years ago to come on as the steel and medical staff continues to ask <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> where the pain is we try to diagnose the injuries tremendous night really at night of euphoria here in the stadium with the celebration of 75 years of steeler football the hall of fame champion greats on the field big night for the team against a rival who beat them bad last year and immediately a bucket of cold water thrown on it all read from 22 with the tough win conditions this end of the field moxa damaged 32 7 and read the kicker comes right at one of the ravens <person player="trevor pryce" race="UNK" position="DT">trevor</person> price i believe you rarely see a kicker not get through and read the tough guy risky kicker would and then coach challenged a defensive player look at this that s the kind of night that without the shells down by <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> michelle i am and he s clearheaded enough to be watching the game in the jumbotron but ill tell you that the athletic trainers are looking at everything from his right foot to the outside of his right calf all the way up into his hip those seem to be the three spots theyre looking at theyre having him flex his right foot against some resistance and yet theyre also concerned about some areas in that calf as i mentioned and then they keep coming up to the hip as well so this could be an injury that has several levels to it and a lot of impact obviously mike ok michelle so well wait for the steelers to give us any further medical word but the observations and down on the sideline and if you just clicking over here s the injury to <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> about five snaps ago you know <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> is 241 pounds and he came down on that hip you could see him grab the hip as soon as he hit the ground and you know common injury for players that hip pointer that muscle that kind of rolls right over the hip and a lot of players including quarterbacks do not wear their hip pads you know they want to be lighter and they dont wear their hip pads and this could be one of those injuries playing without a hip pad im not sure i could tell by the shot at bennett ward or not but a lot of guys who choose to wear those hip pads and they sustained injuries most of smith with the cape return from seven takes it to the 26 down 31 baltimore will take over from there and what a surprise after the whistle pushing and shoving perspective in the history of monday night football going back to september of 1970 most touchdown passes in the game a very eclectic list <person player="david pittman" race="UNK" position="DB">david</person> craig

his sack causing the fumble here leaping tall buildings with a single bound but here deposit get another fumble he is all over the field dropping into coverage reading <person player="steve mcnair" race="nonwhite" position="QB">steve mcnair</person> picking off the ball taking it down the field unbelievable evening by <person player="james harrison" race="nonwhite" position="LB">james harrison</person> look at this three forced fumbles one recovery two and a half sacks interceptions he s doing everything with putting seed on this turf will take abuse by day that is a season worth of stats for some players and he was there along with clark hagen s to make the play me for years these outside linebackers in the threefour has to be impact players think back to greg <person player="rhys lloyd" race="white" position="K">lloyd</person> over the years in addition to the man now in miami joy porter and once again we see <person player="james harrison" race="nonwhite" position="LB">james harrison</person> playing the run beautifully right there shading the block what you have to do when that guard comes out here you have big ben brooks coming around shedding the block making a play again he hadnt rejoined the team prior to training camp at o4 after a year s absence the clark pagans broke his hand it s not for hagen s who went head over heels a couple of plays ago breaking his hand a few years ago pull the bottle takes the big hit up in ship new ski im still having a difficult time where the ravens are throwing the football did not throw in a ball more than 20 yards down the field everything seems to be less than five yards watch paulo model react to the short pass once again makes the tackle once again the ravens half the fun you have to be aggressive with your passing game youre down 38 to 7 you got to take shot tony <person player="troy polamalu" race="nonwhite" position="DB">polamalu</person> looks like bob sanders would have a sit event at this point right the lady blows up plays like a an incredible safety play the national football league down <person player="allen rossum" race="nonwhite" position="DB">rossum</person> lets it go out of bounds at the 34 yard line and that s a kick of 34 yards as we go down to susie carver oh mike massaro <person player="terrell suggs" race="nonwhite" position="DE">suggs</person> get banged up before that last series took a little while for him to come over and finally sit down on the bench he was just rubbing his knee the trainer s put some warming boyfrien on it wrapped it up and then he kind of waved everybody else off but we knew this was going to be a physical battle before the half we saw <person player="ed reed" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ed reed</person> and quarterback <person player="david pittman" race="UNK" position="DB">david pittman</person> both get hurt on the same play both suffered mild concussions it reads much more mild as weve seen he s back in but <person player="david pittman" race="UNK" position="DB">david</person> pitman he is out so on the three deep yet to check the third column now for quarterback for the ravens see some action we her to the left <person player="ray lewis" race="nonwhite" position="LB">ray lewis</person> brings him down marker gain of a yard as suzy was reporting ravens injuries and saw <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> warming up on the steelers sideline that would doubt at this point hed go back to the game but for his own sanity to warm up it s a much better look than it was ten minutes ago when he was being assisted off the field mic the one area the ravens that has excelled has been their down for their three linebackers their soup two safeties they have played well against the run their corners had a rough day in the passing game folks start here well bring it back in the second and 13 were talking about mike tomlin before false start offense the right guard fiveyard penalty second down for the injury to <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> hey mike tom wanted 35 with a very confident personality has really fit in very quickly in a very tough job coaching the steelers there were a lot of people who originally thought that the job would go to ken whisenhunt or to russ grimm because they were homegrown son recently russ cotton homegrown went to school university of pittsburgh and hit a coach here for long time wizard on took himself out of it went arizona people thought it would go to grim was somewhat of a surprise i think when tomlin bubbled up because hed been a coordinator just for one year and in minnesota which had not produced anything of a spectacular nature tomlin himself said he thought he s the last guy on earth to become a candidate after this play so hawaii was in canada it s <person player="charlie batch" race="nonwhite" position="QB">charlie batch</person> pass deflected incomplete the deflection by <person player="bart scott" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bart scott</person> the linebacker here s some of the things that tomlin told us about why he thinks he may have gotten the job and this is a direct quote im a fundamentalist as opposed to schemes it s a violent game and the most violent team wins i believe in running the ball and stopping the run that s my philosophy and it happens to be the historical philosophy of the steelers now for god comes into an interview room and basically lays it out quite like that in the home of the pittsburgh steelers id say he s got a running start to getting the job wouldnt you josh id say he did his homework very well <person player="charlie batch" race="nonwhite" position="QB">charlie</person> badge gives it to nog hey <person player="najeh davenport" race="nonwhite" position="RB">davenport</person> courts gonna get a couple of yards and ill be fourth down <person player="jared gaither" race="nonwhite" position="OT">jared</person> jobs you can hear the ravens defense theyre continuing their attitude and trying to lay a foundation going forward and after tonight and not give up on 38 7 theyve played better here in the third quarter but again they havent had their offense hand the ball to the ravens at the plus 40 the plus 30 the plus 20 all those possessions in baltimore territory like playing out in an arena field 50 yards long i was get my arena for philadelphia so just thank you very much some pole that is a kick again maybe a 56yard punt out of bounds at the 10yard line when we talked about mike tomlin steeler connection follows along here chuckle the legendary coach the hall of fame coach with the steelers during chuck knowles time here tony dungy was a player and then an assistant coach for the steelers we know tony s career is going to be very successful to included being the coach in tampa bay with that tampa to defense that really has its seats here in pittsburgh mike tomlin became the defensive back coach in done g s last year replacing herm <person player="dwan edwards" race="nonwhite" position="DT">edwards</person> would herm took the jets job here comes tomlin after the year in minnesota 2007 he s the stila coach how do you wrap the whole thing up as tomlin said the longer im here i realize a lot of my philosophies fit here is there a lot of donesies philosophies there s a lot of chuck knows philosophies which is stealing football pass complete <person player="mark clayton" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mark</person> plate essentially gain of er and im like you spoke about that cupboard to concept that so many teams play down around the national football league and we saw here the celebration of the 75 years of the steelers that defense was really formed in the mid seventies when joel was the head coach and of course you had the mel blunts and a mike wagner outstanding secondary players they played that confer to and tony dungy was a player here at that time so he understood the cover to concept as they were taught by chuck noll and mike tomlin had those in minnesota turned that viking defense around lash very stingy run unit but was smart enough to let dick lebeau well talk about in the fourth quarter still on the defense pressure off the edge who else guess ooh 92 <person player="james harrison" race="nonwhite" position="LB">james harrison</person> out of penn state the last time i saw 9208 one reggie white <person player="james harrison" race="nonwhite" position="LB">james harrison</person> s fabulous night to the fourth quarter in pittsburgh pennsylvania on monday night football a night to remember for <person player="james harrison" race="nonwhite" position="LB">james harrison</person> the fourth year man of kent state since they started tracking individual sacks in 1982 he s the first player to have a three and a half sack interception and fumble recovery game and add to that total is nine tackles six times he s at the quarterback his own safety or grounding in the end zone what s the beef safety there s no way out of the tackle box for the pass that got close to the line of scrimmage that a racist grounding any grounding in the end zones of safety well <person player="steve mcnair" race="nonwhite" position="QB">steve mcnair</person> really had no chance here an excellent stunt by the steelers upfront quick pressure <person player="steve mcnair" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnair</person> wasnt able to plant his foot he just throwing this one away there s not a receiver to be found not quite sure he got outside that tackle battery clothes lined up on the hash marks and the terr was about even with the tight end on the hash marks the bigger question is why is he still in the game that is a good question 2:38 let s go back to mike tomlin for a second because you cant ignore the great irony here mike that that the rooney rule exists because of the rooney family and it exists who give minority candidates legitimate interviews for head coaching physicians and here comes mike tomlin pretty much out of nowhere and at the place where the rooney rule started mike tomlin gets the job and he s a young man and a lot of people have gone before him and blazed trails have been black coaches like tony dungy in particular who may not have ever felt that that the path was completely open to him and he had to get the job at tampa bay and then get the job at indianapolis to prove it mike tomlin however while acknowledging that people have come before him and blazed the trail my tomlin said that from the time that tony dungy and here s the interesting connection from the time that tony dungy gave him the position coaching job when he was only 28 years old at that point he never saw his own future limited in any way by race or position or stature or experience or anything so he came to this job in his mind not as an africanamerican coach but as a coach seeking a job thinking that opportunity was open to him for no other reason that he could coach football an interesting decision here leading by 31 this quarterback thing gus goes back to <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> who hands off there to parker for a couple of yards was third down i would question that move <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> s had a magnificent night he had some sort of injury we have not gotten clarification on what it was youve got a 38 to 7 lead with about 13 to happens to go in the fourth quarter of this game well in hand i would not risk <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> out in the field ill have with a nice back on that hip corner if that s what it is so now we have two quarterbacks so we dont understand why there is take one what reason put one rats literally another one or <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> is sacked the penalty marker is down as we sort that out we all watch to see if n gets up and nothing to get up but he s helped with other people up here s michelle the official word on <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> was a hip injury and he was questioning december 74 that penalty is declined bridget fourthdown but mike again i would tell you that while they were looking at the hip they were also looking at his lower leg it s it s a mystery to me why he has come back in unless theyre just trying to to get his feet under him to see if he s okay out there 138 731 point game 13 minutes left to see what they do on the next series there is bowler warming up suppose that will pick it away and the ravens have the issue of where theyre gonna be this season to deal with on the trip back to baltimore and beyond because the asking questions of themselves team that won 13 games won the division by five games last year agreed playing possum finds the ground

plays rick was troy prince quarterback coach at ucla the head coach for four years at colorado and <person player="nate washington" race="nonwhite" position="WR">washington</person> in college football the bolar pass is incomplete and threeandout will take it away to not circumstance for bowler he was brought in as you say to be the quarterback of the future and he became the quarterback very early dissatisfaction with him was such that they went out and got <person player="steve mcnair" race="nonwhite" position="QB">steve mcnair</person> and so most people cant say most people i was certainly surprised that he opted to stay with the team and not try to play it out and go somewhere else to stay in a backup role but he s not gonna back up from like if this is somebody not longer right it s not gonna back up <person player="steve mcnair" race="nonwhite" position="QB">steve mcnair</person> doesnt he showed us tonight what s gonna be bowlers job <person player="allen rossum" race="nonwhite" position="DB">rossum</person> from the 35 trying to pick up blockers to gain a yard that was sam cooke s 8 hunt baltimore is seven points for first downs and lots of issues which ones the allegheny which ones the monongahela guys hey tony left does the allegheny that s the monongahela on the right okay and the big thing down the middle is the formulation of the ohio very good you sure is that youre finally that is my final answer yes and i dont need to call somebody up for a lifeline that s what im going with wrong the allegheny is the one right outside the south end zone the monongahela meets it from above at least i didnt you know say the mississippi was being formed i was okay on that well of course yesterday the big story was the big game the patriots rallied from down 10 inside of ten minutes fourth quarter as brady used all of the receiving arsenal the touchdown by falk the force out five jarvis <person player="justin green" race="UNK" position="RB">green</person> <person player="gary russell" race="UNK" position="RB">russell</person> colvin taking it and this is the way i greet my guys the offensive line ward 9 and oh and they will butt heads with the pittsburgh steelers later on down the line the new england patriots and after nine i know those whove been saying theyll be a 16 note they have a chance to be 16 though the question becomes which team as the best chance of knocking off the patriots if you want to realistically think of that it s parker carries for two yards here are the 911 agents who are lost this week not a bye week but it s an off week an open week and then you get buffalo on sunday night in buffalo then philadelphia then we will see the patriots in baltimore in three weeks then they play the steelers at home threegame stretch and the steelers with jen s dolphins and then the last game of the season at the meadowlands against the giants well the teams that stand out there clearly are the steelers and the giants at that point im one of those people who looks at 16 and oh and even 92 no majora s you laughed at me at the beginning of the year youre not laughing anymore i said the turkey has to be in the pumpkin before i stop answering those questions i think it s a bit early she s taught by <person player="nate washington" race="nonwhite" position="WR">nate washington</person> for the first damage entirely batches taken zeke s drive over as we saw and moves it out to the 47 yard line okay i will <person player="grant mason" race="UNK" position="DB">grant</person> you the turkeys not in the oven but it s being dressed your are in the oven has been turned on at this point now the steelers off a night like tonight of course look like a team that might be able to beat the patriots and even though the game is in new england it s not like the steelers cant play in inclement weather as they proven tonight and they proven for many many years the question off of that is looking at those teams run what team has a profile that can give new england the offensive trouble that indianapolis is defense provided yesterday i think really it s a pittsburgh steam you know i think been robbed for there s ability to make plays outside the pocket their outstanding defense active pressure tom brady they can break down the pass protection schemes of the page because of their design their scheme they can get defenders free at brady without having to bring more than they can block in other words you know they can keep a safety in center field so if you beat the blitz you dont give up a home run you give a 10 yard play that s what the steelers can do to calm brady and all his weapons and they can score and they for example the baltimore ravens coming into tonight you would have thought could have done that on defense but they didnt have the ability to score and they cant do that our defense i agree the thing that bothers me about the steelers is they lost two games to teams that they were banished in the denver broncos and these arizona cardinals so at this point there s something about character the makeup that bothers me that they lost those two games actually they havent poor tackled by ed reid and still in the game and a loss of six of the play left third down coming up let me spin this for a second ron to indianapolis and their defense what did you see from the colts defense that gives you i would say a reason to believe they could win in new england if those two teams meet in the afc championship game once again their overall team speed dwight freeney <person player="robert mccune" race="UNK" position="LB">robert</person> math was able to get pressure off the corner i think the way that they play marlon jackson played the way hayden played was terrific they they played box defenders they played a lot of nickel and dime coverage they brought corners down the box and they defended very well so i think they can create problems for the winglet on offense <person player="trevor pryce" race="UNK" position="DT">trevor</person> price unabated to the quarterback will take it to the 45 will you not have encouragement defense number 95 yard penalty third down were you not incredibly impressed in the fourth quarter the way tom brady dissected absolutely annapolis and now you move a team it s very fast and very quick from indoors where that works better to outdoors in the playoffs is that not a significant disadvantage for indianapolis that it wouldnt be for pittsburgh well you know that youre flipping the script the way it was in the past then because now you have the explosive team into women it used to be you know the other way around her but i think that when i look at that colts defense i thought they wore out in that fourth quarter those corners were taking people on and actually the big plays came when they attacked the safeties deep so that s where the big plays came i think theyre foreigners wore out the game consumers react and all sudden yeah the big bats damage team intercepted by and read it was spun down at the 40yard line on the tackle by the tight end <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">heath miller</person> so <person player="charlie batch" race="nonwhite" position="QB">charlie</person> backs you had not thrown any passes before tonight this season throws his 42nd

right there ill get it missed a big circle on him he s in that deep half defender he reads a tight end going down the middle and an outstanding reaction he has to play the outside receiver still look back to the inside great ball skills and the balls in the air he reacts very well <person player="troy polamalu" race="nonwhite" position="DB">polamalu</person> in this game bob sanders discussing from the indianapolis game where that position is spent in this league over the last couple of years of the pass is caught by quints tipped new ski and the ravens will go without a huddle with 7:15 to go reed who left the game earlier with a concussion the one thing i take away from this game is that intense pride of the baltimore defense has often talked about and sometimes we get under other people s skin because i think complete his bowler was hit by <person player="james farrior" race="nonwhite" position="LB">james farrior</person> and <person player="willis mcgahee" race="nonwhite"

medical staff looking at them we take timeout pittsburgh will move to six and to baltimore to four and four that means the cleveland browns will be in second place halfway through the afc north season

mcnair</person> here on the night is not a number to be proud of assuming he is done for the night 13 completions for 63 yards would be the fewest yards in the history of the league for someone who s had a game with 13 or more completions and that just fits the profile that even the times 10 level of the short passing game it s all the passing game right now for the ravens flag down <person player="allen rossum" race="nonwhite" position="DB">rossum</person> returning to the 39 yard line the ravens if you add their points in first downs it equals the number of penalties 11 <person player="prescott burgess" race="nonwhite" position="LB">prescott burgess</person> mad at michigan shaken up in coverage when the ravens were averaging eight point one coming into the game that was the second most penalties in the league this team will have four and four and here s what they will have left and you talk about a gauntlet look at that after the ohio double dip hosting cincinnati and cleveland at san diego and the chargers have been a disappointment new england at home indianapolis at home miami looks good but in seattle by then probably be a pretty good team and then once with the steelers to finish up look here s what they did in the first half of the season they have four wins over teams that have a total combined record of six and twenty seven jets arizona san francisco in st louis they did not beat buffalo they did not be cleveland they did not beat cincinnati they squandered the easy half of their schedule they were a 13 and 3 team last year now that begins to look like a mirage as they were a four and four team facing a schedule three times as hard right as the first half yeah three times the song so flag was on the steelers for blocking as the guy was out of bounds not letting him back in its gonna move the ball back to the 10 <person player="prescott burgess" race="nonwhite" position="LB">burgess</person> is being helped off the field but game he walked off with the assistance of the training staff after he absorbed the block with the blitz a couple of plays ago good day i was gonna say they have injuries all over the field on offense and on defense they have a quarterback who is slowed down enormous <person player="lee vickers" race="UNK" position="DE">lee</person> who is prone to injury himself and they have everybody who apparently has a radio show yelling at each other through the radio airwaves players at coaches coaches at players at the moment they appear to be close to dysfunctional physically as team right i mean with all the notary s theyve got but you know coach phillip <person player="ray lewis" race="nonwhite" position="LB">ray lewis</person> they didnt seem to mind after they were on a radio show why dont you talk you know mike and i do radio and maybe well talk to each other through the radio during the summer months the carry is six carries thus far this year youre referring to <person player="ray lewis" race="nonwhite" position="LB">ray lewis</person> in the conversation back and forth after the last game he he called his cookie just said billy has to ask himself why do we keep putting ourselves in this situation <person player="ray lewis" race="nonwhite" position="LB">ray lewis</person> was criticizing dryin bill explained all thought he passed the ball much too much first and goal second goal third and goal when he had <person player="willis mcgahee" race="nonwhite" position="RB">willis mcgahee</person> for 40 million dollars and brian villa came back and said you really want to do this in public do you think this is a smart thing to do <person player="carey davis" race="nonwhite" position="RB">davis</person> tried to get to the edge <person player="bart scott" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bart scott</person> made the tackle another penalty marker down you know now brian billick can call out every single player that makes a mistake in the course of the game you know that that serves no purpose whatsoever holding offense number 83 half the distance to the goal repeat second down well if <person player="steve mcnair" race="nonwhite" position="QB">mcnair</person> doesnt come back here we have one nfl record we might have another you know there has been one rushing first down picked up tonight pittsburgh has no rushing first downs baltimore has one and that came on the touchdown run by mcgee when you get a touchdown you are credited with the first down statistically the record for two teams fewest rushing first downs of the game is one so so we would tie that right idiots been done twice in league history so if you really want something to root for for the next five 20 if youre a fan of the rushing touchdown combined stab <person player="steve mcnair" race="nonwhite" position="QB">steve</person> hurt our guy down the hill his late going crazy finding this <person player="carey davis" race="nonwhite" position="RB">davis</person> would be carried considering that started this game it was in a monsoon and everybody predicted all they would do was run both teams they will do nothing but run and defend the run their nose and the whole game you know i guess something about what baltimore has done here because in the second half their defense has been pretty good and the first half they had a lot of bad field position he gave up the big plays because they are without both starting quarterbacks jaws i we have a timeout taken by ed hochuli here as a player was being taken out by pittsburgh can you in the pros when youre getting your doors blown off set a tone in the second half like this that can have some carryover impact to next week or the second half of the season there s no such thing as moral victories the game was 35 to 7 at the half they did get their doors blown off they were an awful football team they embarrassed themselves with that first half of <person player="najeh davenport" race="nonwhite" position="RB">davenport</person> runs there goes that record for those of you who are waiting and another player beats down for the ravens grabbing at his leg events justin bannon the defense of i this has been an extraordinarily physical after every play somebody yelling at somebody hitting somebody type game and it goes back to the 58 to 7 toll baltimore s enacted on pittsburgh last year we know it s a violent in the physical game but these two teams that s in their pedigree from <person player="hines ward" race="nonwhite" position="WR">hines ward</person> on through the blitz pickups where the steelers have done with paul amato in the open field and the night that <person player="james harrison" race="nonwhite" position="LB">james harrison</person> has had it s been a night of big hits and that was the scary one about 45 minutes ago when <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> was knocked down by <person player="terrell suggs" race="nonwhite" position="DE">terrell suggs</person> left the game but did come back him and while we have a second suzy has an injury update on <person player="willis mcgahee" race="nonwhite" position="RB">willis mcgahee</person> well you know mike one of the things that the ravens really pleasantly surprised about <person player="willis mcgahee" race="nonwhite" position="RB">mcgahee</person> was just how physical he is and he s just as proud of his pass blocking as he is of running the vaughan of course we saw him get hurt on a pass block play mcgehee suffered a concussion needless to say he is done for the night but you know it s just a shame for so many of these guys who were so fired up to play this game to to match physicalness with the steelers he really felt like this being the 75th anniversary that it was almost like they were setting them up for homecoming and i guess in a sense to sway the score is it sort of seems that way the old college practice of invite somebody for homecoming you know youre gonna beat of course the ravens are the old cleveland browns remember when this franchise moved 12 years ago left in february of 86 of 96 left the browns name color and history for the new cleveland browns to take over as an expansion team when they move to baltimore that before cuts back in if youve ever been around pittsburgh you know that the <person player="jason brown" race="UNK" position="C">brown</person> steelers rivalry is just extraordinary dislike for people like this these loyal fans all the way through the teams and historically were doing our espn radio show overthrown bestest restaurant today it got said to me you know why i hate the ravens as a steeler fan because theyre the old browns i like that they move because i have two sets of teams to hate the old browns the current browns steeler pride the ravens almost had no chance with the steelers at the ran out that 75th anniversary team im in this place was rockin i these fans were into it and im sure the steelers got some energy from seeing those players are they recognized for so many years and idolized the game set up everybody knows everybody knows how these teams play oh my gosh that guy looks like he wandered in from oakland once scott said this the other day <person player="bart scott" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bart scott</person> of the ravens whenever you play the pittsburgh steelers it has nothing to do with schemes it has to do with visit cow who can deal with whom the longest and who s gonna tap out well it looks like the ravens tapped out at this point but the game in terms of the ravens playing tough defense in second if this is who they are that s their identity stealers identity is exactly the same as the ravens identity the steelers with just five times as good to the hot totally the stairs pulled the plug intercepts what im saying what im saying that just five times is good tonight what is that same team essentially super dick warning in pittsburgh tonight steelers honored the past and dominated the president back in pittsburgh see pnc park where the pirates will have a new manager john <person player="gary russell" race="UNK" position="RB">russell</person> was named their manager today they play in the night lit up i guess they didnt get the <person player="justin green" race="UNK" position="RB">green</person> memo i do want to point out by the way that im gonna take on tonight s game notes and put them in our blue recycling bin monday night also looks <person player="justin green" race="UNK" position="RB">green</person> din recycles sapulpa the kick in the way tired 55 yard punt with no return once you look at the the sea of empty seats the mustard colored seats at heinz field it s a stadium built by i guess ill take it myself steelers host cleveland visit the jets there next couple of games confirms gonna move to 62 is complete fighting for yards discrimination derrick to the 28 yard line you know guys on this night of honoring the 75 years of the pittsburgh steelers there s a franchise <person player="mark clayton" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mark</person> that the 12 year old ravens franchise has it excites so theyd like to avoid on this garbage time drive hewish the arts in franchise history past the <person player="mark clayton" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mark clayton</person> well they pick it up about three at a time mike sports center coming up gmc monday night football postgame <person player="steve mcnair" race="nonwhite" position="QB">steve</person> young gavin smith stuart scott here to break it down adrian peterson the rookie sensation over a thousand yards prevalence against san diego and the recordsetting sunday put a cap on week nine those historic plays including one that will last forever unless we go to the cfl rules the longest touchdown in the history of the national football league 100 d9 plus antonio cromartie of san diego the field goal miss return low pass is incomplete he s sucking down coming up so here the numbers on the ravens side the franchise lows equaling it with first downs to the moment within 20 yards of the total yards and that last completion took them over the franchise low for passing yards so it s a ultimate night to forget for the raiders we talk to all about the 75th anniversary jaws and the steelers and all the great players who are here wed be remiss if we did not mention the man who was not here tonight but was honored a couple of weeks ago here at heinz field that s chuck noll the hall of fame coach the architect probably coaching standpoint of those four super bowl championships as mike tomlin followed bill cowher who followed the great chuck noll winning super bowls 9 10 13 and 14 209 wins and his drafts nine players didnt ow hall of famers and he was enshrined in canton in 1993 we mentioned earlier the chief art rooney and dan who s now the chairman 51st year of the organization and can i forget chuck noll as well you see a shot of mike tomlin these are very very large shoes to fill our following knoll tower six times to the afc championship game twice to the super bowl and one one of them right knowles for super bowls tomlin s third in line mean if you if you stay here long enough maybe you can come close to both of those guys but you have to stay a long time enormous shoes for mike tomlin to fill you dont interesting tony earlier you talked about you know mike tomlin being under the radar and conventional wisdom kind of tells that no one knew obama you know an assistant a defense coordinator never thought people people in the business though knew about mike tomlin you know i was down at tampa for a number of years know the coaching staff down there the players they spoke very highly of mike tomlin when he was down in tampa as a secondary coach brad childress goes to minnesota he hires him away from tampa to be his defensive coordinator so people in the know knew about mike tomlin obviously what he s doing now everyone knows about him since into at the moment doesnt first here head probably pretty good darn good now in return you want to talk about the one that would be salt in the wound who s got a balanced by the cutlery cook for awesome was over 10,000 career return yards and thatll wrap it up top ones team will take it me the steelers are gonna win by 31 tonight so theyve won all four of their home games by 20 or more they become the fifth team in nfl history in the second seat in as many years to win their first four at home by 20 or more the bears doing it last year the 91 redskins they wont even eagles yes redskins were super bowl winner they have a great great scene that year only lost two games i think by a total of three and john s do you remember the buffalo allamericans from 1920 remember them very well kid growing up buffalo s members them they invented hot wings the ravens five first downs 104 yards seven points an abysmal night they go to four and four pittsburgh 62 with their victory the ravens did not have a past completion tonight over nine yards the only desire balls over 20 yards down the field and mike tomlin on this night when they bring out all the steeler greats he gets to see one of his current players <person player="james harrison" race="nonwhite" position="LB">james harrison</person> the linebacker come up with a superstar night saxon turnovers and fumbles ravens and steelers to meet again when the season comes to an end and
