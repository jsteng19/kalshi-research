position="QB">cardale jones</person>heather cox on the field hey chris urban <person player="charley meyer" race="UNK" position="WR">meyer</person> has remained team that starting quarterback and tell the first snap but what i can tell you<person player="cardale jones" race="nonwhite" position="QB">cardale jones</person>took the majority of the thirstier wraps in he says simply it was a very tough decision he did meet with both quarterbacks on saturday individually to tell them the news there what i find interesting he did not in dress the entire team he said simply say forget it out on sunday during walkthrough now irvin did say there s a chance that we will see both quarterbacks and grins and even joked he might shock the world and <person player="braxton miller" race="UNK" position="WR">miller</person> come out and take that first step another thank you work i think well see<person player="braxton miller" race="UNK" position="WR">braxton miller</person>takes some snaps at quarterback tonight<person player="cardale jones" race="nonwhite" position="QB">cardale jones</person>the way he left off last season winning a championship people outside might think it was a nobrainer but as good a player as <person player="jt barrett" race="nonwhite" position="QB">barrett</person> was before he got hurt against michigan it didnt make it a tough choice it did and i think that the battle was intense throughout the month of august <person player="jashon cornell" race="UNK" position="DL">cornell</person> jones was was up and then braxton or then<person player="jt barrett" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jt barrett</person>came back in weve been watching their reps very closely as you look right now<person player="cardale jones" race="nonwhite" position="QB">cardale jones</person>is taking the reps and he has been with it the first team center <person player="jacoby boren" race="UNK" position="C">boren</person> so that may be an indication of what we might see with 12 party out jones getting that starters<person player="jt barrett" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jt barrett</person>is the first sophomore captain in the history of ohio state so she went to think of his leadership but he will not be the starter tonight ten acc crew the plan again the referee isnt a man speaking okay this side of the coin is his heads the helmet his heads the side his tails were going to let it hit the ground what do you call it sir who s calling tails we wont let it hit the ground it is tails well house it s won the toss and it s the ferb their choice in the second half virginia tech ill say which way do you want to kick your backs this way please ill say won the toss good luck to the captains so know how state defense that does not have

brewer" race="UNK" position="QB">michael brewer</person>the senior who heard him last year running and throwing in columbus he sure did it was probably the best game that he enjoyed the entire year from the virginia tech offense and he feels he has grown a year under opportunity to learn in the offseason was scott leffler and kind of take that next step so he s hoping to get off to a good start tonight to the 2015 season for sure because he talked about<person player="jt barrett" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jt barrett</person>going out he s talking for the team think about over a hundred years of football first sophomore into history of a program to go out there and represent his team you were a captain you know what that honor is but it s got to be stinging inside a little bit for <person player="jt barrett" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jt</person> because he knows it was a close competition you have to be supportive to<person player="cardale jones" race="nonwhite" position="QB">cardale jones</person>as he was last year after he got hurt be fascinating to watch the buckeye offense with all their different components take to feel that first up itll be the hokies trying to feed up a <person player="warren ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> this energy on the edge of the field what they deal with it on the field is up to that now jack will be he s a graduate transfer from the duke the kickoff duties will kick it away for the buckeyes evidence on take your wine moving back for this is a change from who they they said would return the kickoff for the hokies hi andy will not be brought out michael being at a month and a half to learn this burst out system he was a russian shoot quarterback at texas tech and throughout his high school career he feels much more comfortable to lengthen each of the year ago and that s just in lake travis high school randolph is very similar to texas tech he ends up going to texas backing that all s said walked into a more of a pro style system it wasnt just learning the elephants it was learning his past protections recognizing coverage a lot of different things he was learning on the fly as the year went on and the offensive line gave up a lot of sacks but he earned the respect of his teammates in that first year a year later he feels much more comfortable with this offense senior<person player="jc coleman" race="UNK" position="RB">jc coleman</person>the leading rusher from a year ago who s the tailback behind him by action along the sidelines in traffic <person player="isiah prince" race="UNK" position="OL">isiah</person> <person player="isaiah ford" race="UNK" position="WR">ford</person> incomplete so first im collected on first intent with a defense pinning his tears back little misdirection bootleg to try to find board in the backside here s this offense from a year ago and they struggled now they played well against ohio state everybody got excited about <person player="michael brewer" race="UNK" position="QB">brewer</person> in the direction that they might be going but injuries and turnovers and the youth that they played around <person player="michael brewer" race="UNK" position="QB">brewer</person> really caught up to him as you can see he was too much of a gunslinger last year through 15 interceptions the new scene of this acc crew is the replay official that took another look at whether <person player="isaiah ford" race="UNK" position="WR">ford</person> was able to make that catch it was immediately signaled incomplete it went in looking at it live looked like he might have gotten close to getting a foot down but bell was there to push him out sitting heel touches that s what you have to see is the heel if he stayed with his toe and went out of bounds hed be okay but watch his heel come down as well right there he s out about he wouldnt just toe taps he would have been okay but he when the foot came completely down the backside of his foot stepping out of balance in the group with us tonight is doug rhoades former accc official doug if you were the replay official how would you judge that one well you have to be conclusive obviously beyond all doubt and from that view we have right there i dont see this conclusive as herb says toe and heel comes down out that s out one play we already got a review with a bang bang there on this what s great about that is you take a peek at it and you look at it quickly and you make the right call in a game of this magnitude this early it s the right decision to go upstairs and confirm that when they trust <person player="michael brewer" race="UNK" position="QB">brewer</person> on a first down throw right in the traffic on the sidelines i really think that with him throughout the winter and the spring to get the quizzes and the tests to just learn the different aspects and nuances of this offense think youll see him play better but the guys around him or a year older their tight ends tonight <person player="malik hooker" race="UNK" position="S">malik</person> 88 and <person player="bucky hodges" race="nonwhite" position="TE">hodges</person> seven are gonna

handed off inside and heavy traffic in the middle not much to<person player="jc coleman" race="UNK" position="RB">jc coleman</person>went from fifth string beginning a year to the first three at the end credit to him for perseverance because he could have gone into tank when he lost some reps last year but he kept battling finished the end of the year last year through injuries pitched with three of the last four games over 100 yards here s where <person player="michael brewer" race="UNK" position="QB">brewer</person> was so good in columbus kurt third and long we need seven and nearly as loud for him as it was last year pressure dodges it for a while but now is brought down for a short loss so it s the buckeyes getting a sack from darren lee the linebacker off the edge was there in a hurry defense a lot tonight but it s from virginia tech look at ohio state does here on third down there in their own fair defense and it s this man right here one of the best linebackers in the country ends up coming free because all the linemen are occupied on the inside zeke <person player="ezekiel elliott" race="nonwhite" position="RB">elliott</person> is the punt returner with jalen marshall who was the preseason allamerican at that lowell one of the four suspended players and he makes a fair catch at the 36 and here comes<person player="cardale jones" race="nonwhite" position="QB">cardale jones</person>in the first true road game of his career kurt had three language neutral field that s exactly right playing at indianapolis and new orleans and in the championship in arlington sixfive 250 the arms straight it and he had a good camp that s why he got sick / <person player="jt barrett" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jt</person> benefit with his arm strength chris yeah understand see kelly that s what i think are the mile lines there s that bear defense against<person player="braxton miller" race="UNK" position="WR">braxton miller</person>s in the swat closest to the offensive line one play one keeper in the 250 founder who just gives all kinds of trouble to bama and the dutch defensive ones just like that a year ago adjusting within that game this is a different offensive line in a different offense theyre facing a year later paxton <person player="braxton miller" race="UNK" position="WR">miller</person> just motion into the backfield an option look jones keeps it yeah they hit behind the line<person player="braxton miller" race="UNK" position="WR">braxton miller</person>couldnt pitch it to him and now is scuffle tempers already flaring it every buyer says his guys dont need is personal but it s good numbers have we talked about a little bit earlier it s virginia tech seven sacks the rough spot rough outing for io state and now<person player="cardale jones" race="nonwhite" position="QB">cardale jones</person>on third down here that is the decisive stat last year the buckeyes at home before of 16 on down in the pocket a slap in against that s<person player="michael thomas" race="nonwhite" position="WR">michael thomas</person>who scored on a slant last year against the hokies this is a great matchup with an allamerican corner maybe the best corner number 11<person player="kendall fuller" race="UNK" position="CB">kendall fuller</person>against one of the best receivers he gets inside forward that was the key on a slant <person player="kendall fuller" race="UNK" position="CB">fuller</person> gave away the inside which allowed it allows the quarterback that time chose to stay in the rhythm with the tall lanky<person player="michael thomas" race="nonwhite" position="WR">michael thomas</person>at 6:30 great throw there on third down but a quick route by <person player="michael thomas" race="nonwhite" position="WR">thomas</person> the work inside against <person player="kendall fuller" race="UNK" position="CB">fuller</person> this will be a great matchup on my two first round prospects jones over the minute had a man streaking wide open off the hands of paris <person player="parris campbell" race="UNK" position="WR">campbell</person> one of the newcomers for that receiving core retro freshman and that s the focus of tonight is how with a <person player="trent young" race="UNK" position="LB">young</person> group of receivers that are very talented but theyve never been out there and fronted the crowd the <person player="warren ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> hits them in the hands there s not a safety in the middle this is a touchdown if <person player="parris campbell" race="UNK" position="WR">campbell</person> holds on there s the pressure they go low on the bigger jones they get pressured but the <person player="warren ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> was thrown right on the money by farnell <person player="cameron johnston" race="white" position="P">johnston</person> dropped by paris <person player="parris campbell" race="UNK" position="WR">campbell</person> oh two of polanco is the man who pressured and hit jones just after the throw on second and ten were sure again big fella escapes stefan he s very hard to tackle hi that was the defensive end daddy nicholas who brought him down chris that s what you missed without a <person player="jt barrett" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jt</person> parent you dont he can won but he doesnt really have to switch and nick who we saw last year in this game has tremendous speed takes care that edge of that defense it brings him down after the play was over and sports me my conduct number 50 on the defense fiddler s 15 yards dead <person player="warren ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> foul so were still far down were moving the buckeye is back you said 50 see sifu flags born tempers are high

dan he s a larger quarterback guys understand all week like king kelly but even jones but it gives him a chance here now be it for now terrence sixteen yards in the run they will go for it we need about the 29yard line eliot has yet to have a tux goes in motion and now the employer tilghman he is not in oakland right on kure the man who rumbled through three defenses at the end of the season makes an impact as a receiver three receivers there s a lot to get through and there he comes over but he s too late well designed play there by urban <person player="charley meyer" race="UNK" position="WR">meyer</person> and his staff to give zeke <person player="ezekiel elliott" race="nonwhite" position="RB">elliott</person> time to get out of the flat and use those three receivers to stab his to prevent the safety from getting on place silvan push down first year the game goes up the advance a oneonone battle donovan catch touchdown interesting <person player="curtis samuel"

yards heat plays they had four plays of ten or more yards and that touchdown drives to drop by ferris <person player="parris campbell" race="UNK" position="WR">campbell</person> to unsportsmanlike set up a third and 21 they got in position on fourth and five converted a lot of things happen there and you could see the big play ability with<person player="cardale jones" race="nonwhite"

there this tempo theyre just trying to catch ohio state out of position third catch for thome who cuts the bank and gets the first down to the 30 down winging us you put a lot of pressure on your receipt to win oneonone ohio state plays a twit borders coverage which means theyre gonna walk up their defensive backs and play mantoman against your wide receivers and your tight ends when you do that it makes it tough to run the football because everybody else is attacking downhill into your running game youve got to win some oneonones on the outside with <person player="michael brewer" race="UNK" position="QB">brewer</person> and ends receivers empty backfield against the fourman rush and right away immediate pressure off the end by<person player="sam hubbard" race="white" position="DE">sam hubbard</person>is filling in for bolton tonight but he s our talented cat himself it s a great play by humber been a very poor effort by the right tackle <person player="wade hansen" race="UNK" position="OL">wade</person> henson who dives had just dismisses him keep in mind <person player="sam hubbard" race="white" position="DE">hubbard</person> is a former safety when he came in at a cincinnati bowler he moved to mine backer and he got big enough where he could play defensive end they are really really excited about his potential down the road and as were seeing with<person player="joey bosa" race="UNK" position="DL">joey bosa</person>out he s having a chance to play tonight a tremendous athlete who s a senior whipping the block against a freshman they lost five so second and 15 empty backfield <person player="michael brewer" race="UNK" position="QB">brewer</person> does take off there s a crease he said he s not a dual craft but he s capable of hampering pursue yards myrtle have said a little bit last year but scampering you know scrambling for a few yards is different than today s day and age you see these quarterbacks are just as dangerous as a running you dont have that threat that makes the defense lock when it comes to the run game and with this style defense he s facing tonight this a lot of mantoman which frees up not only the defensive line but linebackers coming down hill right into that running game hokies need nine on third down through her delivers far side broken up by<person player="eli apple" race="UNK" position="CB">eli apple</person>tremendous sophomore corner wonderful freshman year for the jimmy choo team yeah with durant <person player="grant schmidt" race="UNK" position="OL">grant</person> moving on<person player="eli apple" race="UNK" position="CB">eli apple</person>takes over as kind of the elder statesman in the secondary especially a corner this <person player="warren ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> is thrown to the inside it s great coverage by <person player="eli apple" race="UNK" position="CB">apple</person> but the balls got to be thrown closer to the sidelines <person player="eli apple" race="UNK" position="CB">apple</person> has great position there and the only chance <person player="michael brewer" race="UNK" position="QB">brewer</person> would have had is give his receiver a little bit of room to work with and push him towards the boundary <person player="warren ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> was thrown too much to the inside as they afford one of the flag didnt get it see kelly without that half jersey looks different than he yeah that s outlawed this year you love to show the abs but pull that down high snap<person player="aj hughes" race="UNK" position="P">aj hughes</person>the left footed punter lifts it away a fair catch it can be tricky when left put a punter boots in the air it spins different <person player="ezekiel elliott" race="nonwhite" position="RB">elliott</person> not a regular corporate server but makes the fair catch at the 20 is presented by twit silva from capital one earn unlimited 15% cash back if we purchase every day ending heart by toyota let s go places impressive start for the buckeyes you leave 7 nothing they begin their second possession at their own 28 plays there were four ones in four classes paul buy an ed warrior who takes over as play caller with tom herman and moving on to houston as the head coach interesting three receivers there into the boundary the first running attempt rally if it breaks free green grass in front of him touchdown ohio state lightning strikes from 80 yards out when you play this kind of defense it s it s a highrisk highreward defense you either get in the back fielding you get been a penetration or you miss opportunities watch the block right here by pat l find the right guard who kind of opens it up he gets two guys that is a huge hole remember youre committing so many people that first wave of defenders defensive linemen and linebackers that youre anything going to get a three yard loss where if he breaks one arm tackle he s going to do that and go 80 yards daddy niklas is the man that helped wine blocked and he s a great athlete but he s given up a 75 pounds to the guard in that matchup is the confidence that was created late in the year has carried over into the offseason and whatever urban <person player="charley meyer" race="UNK" position="WR">meyer</person> said to challenge them you talk about complacency how s the team that s a defending champ going to be the following year whatever has been said this team has come in with a laser focus and weve just started this football game theyve been the hot theyre not resting on their laurels they have the same swagger and the same confidence that they finished with wisconsin and alabama and oregon they brought in here tonight tulane stadium <person player="ezekiel elliott" race="nonwhite" position="RB">elliott</person> had 121 against michigan he s just getting warmed up 220 against wisconsin soon 30 against alabama including the longest run say that ever given up and then 246 against oregon and but boston defensive coordinators have been puzzled figuring out ways to deal with number 15 and if youre bud foster this scheme that you brought into ohio stadium a year ago warped masterfully against four new offensive linemen some inexperienced quarterbacks and it was a defense that i think controlled the night a year later it s a whole different group of players that youre facing led by jones and now a veteran offensive line and a veteran tale see kelly it wondered is to stay with that highrisk highreward defense it s kind of who there it s their dna that s who they are you dont want to become a bend but dont break defense youre an attacking defense and as i said sometimes it works out for you and other times it backfires and the hokies who never trailed in last year s win at ohio state find themselves down 14 in the crowd as largely being taken out of this until tech can do something positive and said <person player="jack willoughby" race="UNK" position="K">willoughby</person> is going to be busy this year but this is not one of his finest so the hokies would have a little bit of breathing room there was a tennis tournament going on in flushing meadows in the hard courts in new york we will keep you posted and action unfolding over on espn 2 in the murray taken on kevin anderson there at a hole and the hokies they need to make something happen dirk you feel quickly i think the first play the game playaction pass on first and ten i think running into the teeth of this defense right now is challenging the field feels tilted they need to find a matchup they like with either seven<person player="bucky hodges" race="nonwhite" position="TE">bucky hodges</person>maybe <person player="isiah prince" race="UNK" position="OL">isiah</person> for they need to throw the <person player="warren ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> and early downs he was look try to <person player="bucky hodges" race="nonwhite" position="TE">hodges</person> he was well covered circle to over the middle and they can he catches the fat end foods that leading receiver last year against the buckeyes miniputt sips and <person player="malik hooker" race="UNK" position="S">malik</person> and <person player="bucky hodges" race="nonwhite" position="TE">hodges</person> are real weapons because of their versatility they name their call tieins but to take some of the pressure off their strength which is the running game<person player="sam rogers" race="UNK" position="FB">sam rogers</person>the fullback takes the handoff jason s frank in a burst breaks a few tackles down near the 36 coaches posing as a walkon and earned a scholarship because of his attitude i dont never have heard of that one week at 16 yards is determination there give it to him again similar play but this time<person player="adolphus washington" race="UNK" position="DL">adolphus washington</person>was there to clog it up and still rodgers fights forward for a couple defensive line without michael bennett theyre relying heavily upon <person player="adolphus washington" race="UNK" position="DL">washington</person> to become that playmaker up front especially with<person player="joey bosa" race="UNK" position="DL">joey bosa</person>out of this this game tonight with bose that you had 13 and a half sacks a year ago 21 tackles for a loss i mean just arguably the best player in college football you take him out <person player="adolphus washington" race="UNK" position="DL">washington</person> <person player="sam hubbard" race="white" position="DE">hubbard</person> and these others that are athletic and they need to be able to step up and make plays and philips in motion on second and seven throw it in the flat this is the first college touch for trayvon <person player="raekwon mcmillan" race="UNK" position="LB">mcmillan</person> the redshirt freshman running back like juan luis dropped him itll be third in medium state bringing pressure a lot with darren lee there in the played up on his feet it is an outside linebacker they they field this year not only blitzing him which he did a lot of now youll see theyre going to put him down on the defensive line here he is on third down lined up as a <person player="guy ferrelli" race="UNK" position="TE">guy</person> who can just rush to the pasture so the versatility lined up outside and also blitzing and rushing the passer rule was so good on third down a year ago needs a conversion here as time delivers all over the middle incomplete he was just behind<person player="bucky hodges" race="nonwhite" position="TE">bucky hodges</person>but catchable for the tight end and it s fourth down they found a hole right now where theyre trying to get those tight ends to work behind<person player="raekwon mcmillan" race="UNK" position="LB">raekwon mcmillan</person>and try to find those those passing lanes <person player="raekwon mcmillan" race="UNK" position="LB">mcmillan</person> does a pretty good job of trying to get a hand on the <person player="warren ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> i think brewers saw a window and <person player="bucky hodges" race="nonwhite" position="TE">hodges</person> kind of ran through that window and that s why he had to end up coming back to the football just a little miscommunication there but there is a little bit of room to work with for the quarterback behind the line bass so joey sly tries a career long 50yard field goal we had started right and it stayed right had plenty of distance but the hokies cannot dent the 14point lead created by the 80 yard touchdown run by zeke <person player="ezekiel elliott" race="nonwhite" position="RB">elliott</person> who begins this season right where he left off last now the indispensable hapless ports family pushy college football fans the watch espn app visit watch espncom ustream every game live when youre on the go endorsed by all of us

race="UNK" position="RB">samuel</person> who was pretty open over there it s the second time weve seen this time it s part of <person player="curtis samuel" race="UNK" position="RB">samuel</person>

situations and theyre all back next game yes why look at hawaii obviously look they let jones keep it as they covered <person player="ezekiel elliott" race="nonwhite" position="RB">elliott</person> when he falls for her for a twoyard game tori marshall stop them a chance to show anything yet tonight but keep an eye on him as this game continues to go on <person player="noah brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brown</person> trying to make itself for joan s on third and seven good protection fire still wide open nick bennett first down across the 45 yard line as they involved a senior tight end there s going to be a big part of the offense tonight typically they like to get into your face the nets right here he and parents can will watch the route combo route that you work together and you can see two defenders kind of carry downfield with <person player="parris campbell" race="UNK" position="WR">campbell</person> and made he read for jones to make that throw underneath to the big tight end vennett world six start for jones in the touchdown oh keys are pointing to ohio state im sun 3/5 number 92 made contact 5 yards first down <person player="luther maddy" race="UNK" position="DT">luther</person> maddie one of the senior defensive lineman who carries that famous hokey lunch pail around it s been given the honor and the responsibility this week but a mental error makes it even easier for this buckeye offense now first and five play clock at five jones again excellent protection delivers a lowgrowing<person player="braxton miller" race="UNK" position="WR">braxton miller</person>showing the skills a diving catch youre leaving sophomore alone here against<person player="braxton miller" race="UNK" position="WR">braxton miller</person>this is his first catch it is he lays out gets his body underneath as he turns and now racks a note lined up it s under center part of the shotgun here the first wildcat look for the twotime big ten offensive player of the year he cant shake a tackle <person player="braxton miller" race="UNK" position="WR">miller</person> is a <person player="guy ferrelli" race="UNK" position="TE">guy</person> who had put 1200 yard rushing games as a quarterback in 30 rushing touchdowns as a passer only had one multiple interception game he says he can throw wellstone and that s the wrinkle within this offense with<person player="braxton miller" race="UNK" position="WR">braxton miller</person>now is an h bag that youll probably see that package will grow gone that s his first direct snap of the night jones got back at quarterback <person player="braxton miller" race="UNK" position="WR">miller</person> told me that the surgeon who did the operation on the shoulder dr english was one of the guys who convinced him as there s some confusion there at a time ounce gonna be called that was instrumental in <person player="braxton miller" race="UNK" position="WR">miller</person> s decision to shift positions he was worried about wear and tear on the shoulder tonight s an impact rematch of last season s so down and so is oregon at michigan state next saturday primetime on abc the ducks ranked number 7 spartans number 5 see if the change in venue there makes a difference these hockey fans kurt there s a little bit of a up boy we knew ohio state was good weve seen this from our team a lot in recent years they have just not been able to translate the pregame energy into great home field performances and ohio state has already exceeded their rushing total from last year s game and down 14 still in the first quarter it should feel like this series and how this defense plays they want to stay in this game they better step up jones again has time flips it into flat for elliot and oneonone battle which he wins against the <person player="trent young" race="UNK" position="LB">young</person> clark itll be third and short jones is known for his arm strength to this one wont show up tomorrow the highlights but this gives you an idea of his touch well throw <person player="warren ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> from the pocket to coverage look from his perspective a lot tighter than that and he just had to put that right over the linebacker that time bar can right into the hands of t delia trips again into the boundary up at the top so often last year this was a quarterback keeper it is again a crease for big parnell jones a flag comes in as a couple of them so hold on 250 pounder was untouched that option but it s going to come back mm sell to play holi left side of the offensive one thing with a good fee of holding their duck urine <person player="billy price" race="UNK" position="OL">price</person> they wanted to get they wanted to get here s the left side right here obviously <person player="taylor decker" race="UNK" position="OL">decker</person> has a double team here with the tight end theyre optioning the end man on the line of scrimmage there s a hole right there you can see it why the hole was so big an offensive line that will take a lot of pride in playing out tonight because they did not look good last year against the hokies but they became a great phone line by the end of the season tech desperately needs to make a play here jones has time delivers its paris <person player="parris campbell" race="UNK" position="WR">campbell</person> with his first career catch after the drop earlier he s dropped short of the first down by face on and theyre gonna really have complete so twice they targeted him one s been complete it looked like a catch and then he started to starting to take a few steps he was turning that he have control of the football before was knocked loose bring in doug rhodes on this one yeah you have to maintain you know catches a process possess it control it and he didnt appear to control it so i think that s perfect so two drops early this is<person player="jack willoughby" race="UNK" position="K">jack willoughby</person>from 43 yards missed it so each side has missed a field goal and in the final minute and of the first quarter the hokies avoid further damage let s take a look at this again you can see that at what point do you consider it he s maining maintain possession 1 2 3 that s 4 steps that s not that s not maintaining and the <person player="warren ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> did bounce up into his hand so had it been ruled a catch and a fumble would have been on our city if you make the rulebook says make a move common to the game like several steps that s pretty close to the hit college of the game now it still would have been fourth down but if itd been workin short this is trey edmonds around now state offense comes up empty for the first time tonight well one way or another virginia tech gets the stop with a missed field goal kind of the break that they needed this the see if they can try to create a spark here but again cuz im gonna go back to the temple would help but it s it s really about the passing game with <person player="michael brewer" race="UNK" position="QB">brewer</person> which is what he s known for and the receivers getting separation to have a chance tonight i snap on second and three messed up the timing of the ploy and treatments just tripped you lose about four because until they start to have some success downfield what hi oh state from my vantage point what ohio state is doing which is what you knew they would do because it s who they are they literally running downhill towards this running game and imagine being an offensive lineman and youre trying to deal with the defense is just pinning its ears back not respecting the vertical passing game until they do that it s going to be tough to run the football another third down protect they need seven clock running down inside of five in the first quarter <person player="michael brewer" race="UNK" position="QB">brewer</person> throws on a slant and the catch is made by <person player="isiah prince" race="UNK" position="OL">isiah</person> for just enough gary <person player="gareon conley" race="UNK" position="CB">conley</person> so the hokies do convert to end the quarter but it s all ive sent for 15 minutes watching the aecc on espn beginning in the second quarter dominated by ohio state total yards 205 256 80 yards in <person player="ezekiel elliott" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ezekiel</person> a touchdown run jones<person player="curtis samuel" race="UNK" position="RB">curtis samuel</person>touchdown pass on the first possession of the game and out<person player="michael brewer" race="UNK" position="QB">michael brewer</person>in the hope he s had two converting on a third down desperately need to create something get the crowd back in it with the defense arrest <person player="michael brewer" race="UNK" position="QB">brewer</person> pump fakes now lobs it down feel has <person player="isiah prince" race="UNK" position="OL">isiah</person> <person player="isaiah ford" race="UNK" position="WR">ford</person> wide open a flag comes in as the receiver tight folks to the 32 the flag was in the backfield holding against the okies will wipe it away owning from the 57 offense tenyard still course down we got the sophomore guard<person player="wyatt teller" race="UNK" position="OL">wyatt teller</person>negated a 31yard pass mantoman youve got to hit some plays that was a slant and go oneonone against the<person player="eli apple" race="UNK" position="CB">eli apple</person>it s a matchup that virginia tech with <person player="michael brewer" race="UNK" position="QB">brewer</person> and <person player="isaiah ford" race="UNK" position="WR">ford</person> they feel comfortable with but the holding paul negates it and scott leffler says youre gonna get about four shots downfield against it on how state defense this good to change it quarterback now brendan <person player="brenden motley" race="UNK" position="QB">motley</person> the junior from christiansburg virginia and is in there it s a low snap he s gonna pick his way and actually finds a little crease and barrels forward itll be third and three 6:3 221 pounds sieve <person player="brenden motley" race="UNK" position="QB">motley</person> with some natural instincts to run with that football and i just talked about when you take the thread away from a dual threat quarterback puts a lot of pressure on your passing game against this kind of defense and youve got to be able to throw the <person player="warren ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> to be able to open up the running game well <person player="brenden motley" race="UNK" position="QB">motley</person> can give you a little bit of something in that backfield to make the defense have to be aware of his ability to run stuff to come in on first and 20 in your first possession though he hands off the <person player="raekwon mcmillan" race="UNK" position="LB">mcmillan</person> who cuts back his first college football action almost made a huge play a couple brave clocks ryan mallett the titan 88 year left to watch 45<person player="sam rogers" race="UNK" position="FB">sam rogers</person>he gets two of them right there and then downfield that is tremendous effort hair weve heard all about sam rodgers having a great camp that leader this team he really opened that up for macmillan to be able to pick up those extra yards for the first down joshua <person player="aaron parry" race="UNK" position="OL">parry</person> the linebacker grabbed an ankle to perhaps prevent a touchdown much seeded conversion in blue or his back in a quarterback it s a real route and wired up in the<person player="sam rogers" race="UNK" position="FB">sam rogers</person>and now 51 yards that x walkon kirk he told us earned a scholarship in a week he s not just a good singer he s a football player it sure is he makes plays for his team sly slides the extra point and a muchneeded 74yard in six play touchdown drive as the hokies cut the lead in half<person player="sam rogers" race="UNK" position="FB">sam rogers</person>didnt catch him but one touchdown pass last year that was against the buckeyes both career touchdowns against ohio state lane sitting awakened by that touchdown drive and as they kick off there are three edmund brothers the report tina s trey were 22 as <person player="tyrell smith" race="UNK" position="OL">tyrell</person> 29 is <person player="tremaine edmunds" race="nonwhite" position="LB">tremaine</person> he s the true freshman sons of farrell edwards jr the pro bowl tight end this man never happened before kurt never seen that see two brothers but how about that three they dont get a chance to make a tag goal because slide the boots it did but well see that on all the kicks off tonight let s go back to that touchdown a great call here by scott leffler rolling the quarterback to the right here s your fullback who s going to eventually slide out but watch the action going this way how it draws the attention of the linebackers and the safety action goes away freeza right here and you see the receiver going this way takes eli apples there s nobody down in this area and here comes the bull back he just leaks out nobody picks him up the big fella <person player="tommy schutt" race="UNK" position="DL">tommy</person> shut tries to pick him up but to no avail and then not giving up on the play that s a corner<person player="eli apple" race="UNK" position="CB">eli apple</person>trying to make that play and space and gray that front again together the owns endzone by<person player="sam rogers" race="UNK" position="FB">sam rogers</person>and the touchdown brings back the crowd noise trying to make life tough on the buckeyes jones hands it off the elliot had tried to make a blind tailback didnt need much help 11 we talked about <person player="sam rogers" race="UNK" position="FB">rogers</person> discovering kickoffs he s blocking people eli apples had some highlights in his career that will not be any fun in the film room we will not and<person player="braxton miller" race="UNK" position="WR">braxton miller</person>in the <person player="warren ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> game the end of the shotgun i snap <person player="braxton miller" race="UNK" position="WR">miller</person> hesitation makes the cut it just runs into heavy traffic so two carries short gains familiar that defense of mine fare front doing a better job at getting off blocks on that play weve not seen a lot of that ohio state has dominated up front in the trenches such a different story from a year ago went four of the offensive linemen were new new faces with an inexperienced quarterback now tonight theyve been playing well but jinny tech showing some life on that play daddy niklas ripped off <person player="braxton miller" race="UNK" position="WR">miller</person> s helmets who s got to come out of the game second and eight another high snap and again traffic jones looking for rome flag comes out as the big fella picks his way near the first down marker but again it s in that holding zone holding <person player="ezekiel elliott" race="nonwhite" position="RB">elliott</person> s going to deal with a pressure go to you of the hold he just talked about daddy nichols press gives you an idea he had a great game last year against ohio state he s right here and this is what they want to do they want to shoot gaps it s a blown assignment zeek tries to tackle him which he does that s why there s a holding call nicholas is he if misused storyboarding a haiti he s working in his second degree at virginia tech and they say okay he may not be fully more in terms of ability but they think he s the closest to it but they dont this is gross of players and spory more it says it all right there in the late nineties and he makes it second in 18 jones again gets away that time from nicholls he is tough to tackle and he shows some speed to <person player="chase farris" race="UNK" position="OL">chase</person> 10 on the far side you got a tackle different hit against the big <person player="guy ferrelli" race="UNK" position="TE">guy</person> and daddy nichols at the defensive line maybe 63 227 pounds in<person player="cardale jones" race="nonwhite" position="QB">cardale jones</person>is much bigger at 250 pounds there s the athletic ability he s third straight play he gets in there he goes right by pat l5 but but foster the defensive coordinator for virginia tech challenged his week the entire camp with <person player="jashon cornell" race="UNK" position="DL">cornell</person> jones you better go low youre not going to be able to bring him down like a ben roethlisberger type of quarterback and <person player="chuck clark" race="UNK" position="CB">chuck</person> barb to safety their top tackler he really couldnt run down theyre 34 june s deflected diving attempt in a second the pec is made by <person player="desmond frye" race="UNK" position="S">desmond</person> fry on the deflection dion court gotta hear that at bruce smith the good cookie loves it number four he gives his hand on the football and a tremendous effort to go into the air that time by pride to come up with the interception well take a peek to make sure he got his hands it looks like he gets his hands and elbows underneath the boat goes that zone here s a great looked at it there s clark with his hands up <person player="warren ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> it s free at that point no interference calls and it s about whether or not he got his his arms underneath the football from every look that we have so far it looks like a clean interception again it has to be conclusive video heaven saul would sign that call on the field goes the <person player="warren ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> hit the ground his hands are underneath it it s an acc replay crew bring in doug rhodes this is this is tricky i havent seen a replay yet doug that looks conclusive enough well in this case here it s important to realize the fall it s possible for the <person player="warren ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> to touch the ground and that s okay as long as it s under full control when it touches the ground but the ground cannot become the third hand that allows him to catch it so in this case here i you know did his people will beyond any doubt to turn it over no it s got to go with the interception like fries hands were underneath the <person player="warren ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> then it popped up but you cant tell if it popped up from his forearms popping it up or the ground right you cant tell if it s at the ground or his hands youre gonna go with the call on the field exactly and one of the basic tenets of replay is you presume it s correct on the field and before you do anything else indisputable beyond all doubt so that s kind of the tenets of 3 foot after further review so dean park the top returning tackler the disruptive linebacker he makes the big play to pop it up in the air and athletic diving pick by frog we talked about when they were down 14 they need his spark the missed field goal by ohio state the next possession they go down and they get a touchdown but a big <person player="guy ferrelli" race="UNK" position="TE">guy</person> <person player="sam rogers" race="UNK" position="FB">rogers</person> now their defense goes back out of the field they create a turnover all for the tip they get the <person player="warren ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> back to the offense and brewers on the sidelines and <person player="brenden motley" race="UNK" position="QB">motley</person> who gave him a little bit of something with his skill his ability to run the football back out there he began the drive at quarterback and then <person player="michael brewer" race="UNK" position="QB">brewer</person> came in a few touchdown pass montly again takes off could not make hundley miss on the edge short game see when brewers comes in to tenancy is it going to hand it off or theyre going to throw it and so far what weve seen so far from <person player="brenden motley" race="UNK" position="QB">motley</person> is it s some kind of quarterback run game and until he throws the <person player="warren ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> the defense will zero in on when number nine comes into the game on quarterback run he s going to have to throw the football to be able to make the ohio state defense respect that aspect of this offense when he s in the game they ended the man in motion that s greg strumming and all over it is there and lead so your options are very limited again so far from what weve seen and so youre either thinking a quarterback is going to run it or you gonna have a jet sweep it s a totally different offense to contain there and the overall team speed from ohio state just too much there for that flag what s it like now for michael drew who comes in first action in the series and he faces a third and 15 not very good you dont love what theyre doing weve got to find a match up and this is where<person player="bucky hodges" race="nonwhite" position="TE">bucky hodges</person>could come into play right here also the other tight end right here <person player="malik hooker" race="UNK" position="S">malik</person> diffic not as a cushion but again they need 15 yards <person player="michael brewer" race="UNK" position="QB">brewer</person> flushed close diving play made he was very near the line of scrimmage theyre calling in to catch at the 35 yard line wow natalie who s the big tight end take a rhythmic catch when he got his hand underneath the <person player="warren ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> went up in the air but was after his hand clearly was underneath it ohio state blitzes but at that time darren lee got caught with his eyes in the backfield and he didnt look around to see the receivers in this case brian <person player="malik hooker" race="UNK" position="S">malik</person> in his area he lost him and <person player="michael brewer" race="UNK" position="QB">brewer</person> found him after stepping up into the pocket and area that he s really worked on this summer to improve in on him first down this is<person player="jc coleman" race="UNK" position="RB">jc coleman</person>so one third 14 <person player="michael brewer" race="UNK" position="QB">brewer</person> comes in cold and and the titan makes the quarterback look good with the terrific wrap and it was a musty coverage from ohio state but it was remember we thought yesterday was fat left where he said you know one thing with<person player="michael brewer" race="UNK" position="QB">michael brewer</person>was he came out of that texas tech offense where everything was quick get the body or hands he s had to learn how to climb into the pocket climbing into the pocket and more of a profile offense especially on third down is your friend and that time he did climb up into the pocket that s what bought it in time to be able to eventually find <person player="malik hooker" race="UNK" position="S">malik</person> knew that saitm should be key so far the buckeyes have held<person player="bucky hodges" race="nonwhite" position="TE">bucky hodges</person>without a catch mrs coleman again tough little customer a short game there<person player="joshua perry" race="UNK" position="LB">joshua perry</person>stopped him that will be third along again just by the addition of brendon <person player="brenden motley" race="UNK" position="QB">motley</person> has given this offense just enough of a sum of ability to break some tendencies in a different look to make this ohio state decent have to communicate and have to look left and right make sure everybody is on the same page so when you go back to 12 <person player="michael brewer" race="UNK" position="QB">brewer</person> then back to <person player="brenden motley" race="UNK" position="QB">motley</person> spin to series but weve seen some success here for the virginia tech offense with <person player="brenden motley" race="UNK" position="QB">motley</person> coming in as a changeup mokey s make a play on 3rd and 8th what guys showing crusher they bring it <person player="michael brewer" race="UNK" position="QB">brewer</person> gets it that quickly delivers far side camp phillip saw is going to be wrestled down immediately by conway short of a first down about four on fourth down now i dont know what<person player="cam phillips" race="UNK" position="WR">cam phillips</person>is thinking there he he goes up field he should have worked it a little bit higher but after he makes the catch he goes back <person player="gareon conley" race="UNK" position="CB">conley</person> s there and then youve got four or five other white jerseys so instead of being about a yard short because of what he decided to do with the <person player="warren ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> after he caught it now theyre about four or five yards short so joey sly missed from 50 but had the distance before tries this one from 46 makes the correction and bangs it through so the hokies who were reeling really on the ropes scored 10 points and cut the buckeyes lead to 4 midway 2nd quarter this drive set up by a turnover and a couple of diving catches after they got the <person player="warren ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> makes the correction but guys the hokies on espn espn college football brought to you by volkswagen isnt it time for german engineering and dr pepper and college football it s a oneofakind tradition grandpa s is a west virginia fan he saw the combo jersey was wearing is he rock blacksburg a free concert lesson he did play some rock and roll he played with satisfaction for the stones he played enter sandman for the crowd work he knows his crowd tell me he was practicing it more than playing oh sure he did cars again and again no action for the edmonds brothers another touch back a paisley friend of college they because your guests pictures gameday has headed to east lansing saturday great start for rece davis you guys itll be ill have to talk about a pretty good schedule for a week two the headline game of course is oregon at michigan state at primetime on abc be great to be in east lansing there was such a great matchup last year between oregon and michigan state they did the pregame show theyll be along a halftime as well the complexity of this first half has certainly changed it s <person player="braxton miller" race="UNK" position="WR">miller</person> in the backfield to the right of jones and now an option looking again do a pretty good job of taking away the pitch and let the big <person player="guy ferrelli" race="UNK" position="TE">guy</person> carry it well theyre making him indecisive on the option would you love to see a quarterback run the option youd love to see him just attack down hill and make the defensive end commit one way or the other in here he starts to kind of attack and then he starts down might pitch and then the <person player="guy ferrelli" race="UNK" position="TE">guy</person> goes out to the pitch and because he s bigger he doesnt quite have that same quickness to be able to accelerate on field so even though he gained a couple yards that would be a win for virginia tech s defense and a good play by ian clark now it s <person player="braxton miller" race="UNK" position="WR">miller</person> in the right slot from a motion <person player="ezekiel elliott" race="nonwhite" position="RB">elliott</person> but the other slide crusher jones takes a shot downfield over the head of <person player="braxton miller" race="UNK" position="WR">miller</person> and we wondered is this going to be the devin smith deep threat of this year somebody s got a have to step up and become devin smith or devin smith from a year ago he was not just fast you and i were talking about it this afternoon his <person player="warren ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> skills and ability to adjust to the football for legend dear students for the last couple years so they feel<person player="braxton miller" race="UNK" position="WR">braxton miller</person>with his speed could become that <person player="guy ferrelli" race="UNK" position="TE">guy</person> but again you still see but foster playing this same defense live by the sword die by the sword leaving those defensive backs one on one out there in some cases without any safety behind them need a on third down jones takes off no hesitation<person player="cardale jones" race="nonwhite" position="QB">cardale jones</person>rumbles for a first down and much more to the 45 so design run all the way and they they felt pretty good about the quarterback one game coming in look how this play opens up on the left side nice pull by pat el fine a block there by zeke <person player="ezekiel elliott" race="nonwhite" position="RB">elliott</person> the receivers downfield and next thing you know number 12 is lumbering down for the big game and a first down aleppo <person player="ezekiel elliott" race="nonwhite" position="RB">elliott</person> besides being a star with the <person player="warren ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> in his hands is it embraces blocking tom herman last year said his greatest gift as a player was how physical he is without the football that s about as good a compliment as you can give or start running back as to carries so far one of them for 80 yards and now a third and alia danced for positive yard each other you guys are talking but foster some adjustments i overheard he was saying that the dline must adjust against the speed option widen out the space between the guard and tackle split then he said the bear defense must be able to adjust right or left especially against the tight end and that safety needs to know where the help is coming from at all times a couple things to keep our eye on heather grab a grease board safety support coming in leverage the football ganna make plays a good chess match though perfect point in second down they need five jones pressured hit big fella gets it away anyway glad to get it to <person player="curtis samuel" race="UNK" position="RB">samuel</person> in traffic cannon theyre leading sacker a year ago was there he just got a bounced off the portal he cannon but watch how he works to the top of the screen just goes around with quickness<person player="billy price" race="UNK" position="OL">billy price</person>that s one way to take away the effectiveness of<person player="cardale jones" race="nonwhite" position="QB">cardale jones</person>or any quarterback if you can get pressure he hit at this step he s ready to throw and he s got a defensive lineman right in his face another third down ohio state three is six so far tonight empty backfield <person player="curtis samuel" race="UNK" position="RB">samuel</person> in motion in the flat and the <person player="warren ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> was knocked away once again dion cleric who created the carom which led to the pick knocked that pass down fourth down this is been a bread and butter play for urban <person player="charley meyer" race="UNK" position="WR">meyer</person> in this first half when they get the running back out into the flat and you can see the defendant running with him at the top there s a long way for strowman to get there and if clark doesnt get up and knock that down that s another first down on the exact same play to the running back out of the backfield theyre destroying it to announce a plaque the prime minister of defense is that how bud foster was introduced to us so loyal him across beamer as a player at murray state he s been with him basically from the start here at virginia tech<person player="kendall fuller" race="UNK" position="CB">kendall fuller</person>makes the fair catch and the hokies defense rising up they get the football back down only four very slow start for the hokies and the crowd was out of it an outofstate looking very tough to stop on offense but now tech actually gets the <person player="warren ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> back with poor field position with a chance to take the lead that look unlikely about 20 minutes ago they get off to a slow start with these last couple series theyve found some things that have been working and changed some things up with as i said earlier <person player="branden bowen" race="UNK" position="OL">branden</person> <person player="brenden motley" race="UNK" position="QB">motley</person> coming in coleman darts forward that s one of the better runs they have had tonight up the middle it s amazing when an offense that s been struggling the way they did in those first few series yall you bring in a different wrinkle and it makes the defense think about some other things then you can go back to your old breadandbutter in which you hope to run originally but <person player="michael brewer" race="UNK" position="QB">brewer</person> the quarterback tried to throw a block and coleman had to kind of walk around him their first three series it was 14 plays in just 45 yards and they were going out in a hurry and in the last two series coming into this one they had 12 plays 111 yards in 10 points ohio state had missed the field goal theyve turned that into a touchdown and they had an interception they turned that into a field goal both teams tonight are 3 for 7 and 3rd down these need just one theyve had third and long a bunch tonight tre edmonds behind <person player="sam rogers" race="UNK" position="FB">rogers</person> the fullback in the i formation <person player="michael brewer" race="UNK" position="QB">brewer</person> keeps it and theyll move the change talked a lot about micro michel <person player="michael brewer" race="UNK" position="QB">brewer</person> bing from the state of texas with the high school lake travis down in austin kind of a <person player="guy ferrelli" race="UNK" position="TE">guy</person> who loves football kind of your typical texas high school quarterback top football family dad played quarterback at texas his grandfather played football at texas and when you when you have that background you kind of born with the game and the love for the game and he kind of has that bluecollar approach to how he plays this game it was evident last year where he took so many sacks and took so many hits and never really complained about it brewers dad and granddad played football at texas with as you said kirk he was denied permission to go to the longhorns ended up like a gray hey have a gray shirt jd <person player="jt barrett" race="nonwhite" position="QB">barrett</person> warming up on the sidelines celebrating its 11th year sponsoring the good hands field goal nets all state makes contributions to participating universities general scholarship funds for each field goal and extra point kicked today allstate has contributed millions in scholarship funds first down for the hokies 3:13 before halftime <person player="sam rogers" race="UNK" position="FB">rogers</person> caught the touchdown pass earlier is really good an impact player in this first half nice first down game i think with the adjustments from virginia tech i think were starting to see an offensive line play a lot better than they did the first couple series where they just looked overwhelmed with ohio state s athletic ability and strength so these last two or three series they have opened up some room and some running lanes for these backs in their in their zone read game no line which is one senior in the center making his first start tonight marik <person player="eric gallo" race="UNK" position="OL">gallo</person> <person player="michael brewer" race="UNK" position="QB">brewer</person> on second down bro is into traffic ward was there gooden come up with it bob ellen coverage the bond bell got a hand on that or not but it looks like scored was he able to secure that for a catch and a first down balls in his hands popped out yeah was very catchable mokey s receivers have been very sure handed tonight though some excellent grabs yet another third down six sport in motion what guys rush for in the flat damn <person player="cam phillips" race="UNK" position="WR">phillips</person> going backwards again and knocked down well short of the marker they tried to get it to <person player="cam phillips" race="UNK" position="WR">phillips</person> a couple times on third down but he hasnt been able to get near the six connelly on the tackle time ohio state just rushing for as you said chris showing blitz but ended up rushing for and dropping seven darren lee got pressure put him down not always to blitz but just as a rusher especially joey boasts out and he got the pressure forced <person player="michael brewer" race="UNK" position="QB">brewer</person> to get the <person player="warren ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> out of his hands so the buckeyes will get the football back inside of two minutes to halftime theyve got a couple timeouts to work with see if <person player="ezekiel elliott" race="nonwhite" position="RB">elliott</person> can set him up in good field position the lefty <person player="aj hughes" race="UNK" position="P">hughes</person> poops it away low kick fumbled by eliot still loose on the sidelines hokies have it so <person player="ezekiel elliott" race="nonwhite" position="RB">elliott</person> filling in for <person player="jaylen bradshaw" race="UNK" position="WR">jaylen</person> marshalls suspended as punt returner makes a mistake and tech has set up the box take the lead wow second turnover for ohio state and when you try to knock off the numberone ranked team youre going to get a few opportunities and you got to be able to win the turnover margin see kelly the one thing you know he can run but it s being able to secure from a punt from a leftfooted the punter it s tougher the second time he s been a little bit unsure and that one he ended up coughing up and the <person player="warren ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> goes back to the hope he s here before the first half of the minute 30 to go so a couple of mistakes and after ohio state had jumped out to a 14 nothing lead like the <person player="anthony shegog" race="UNK" position="UT">anthony</person> s chicag ended up getting on top of that outside linebacker on special teams <person player="michael brewer" race="UNK" position="QB">brewer</person> crusher loops it downfield for jeboa grouchland at the coulee and <person player="michael brewer" race="UNK" position="QB">brewer</person> got hammered after the throw very slow to get up but he s trucking down there now <person player="adolphus washington" race="UNK" position="DL">washington</person> and lewis converge in the top quarterback remember how tough this <person player="guy ferrelli" race="UNK" position="TE">guy</person> is he got beat up on a high o state and a lot of other teams two defenders get to in bond bell got lost in coverage in mantoman coverage against<person player="isaiah ford" race="UNK" position="WR">isaiah ford</person>his eyes may be looking into the backfield <person player="isaiah ford" race="UNK" position="WR">ford</person> got behind him and bell fortunate that <person player="warren ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> did end up going into the end zone for a touchdown towards a <person player="guy ferrelli" race="UNK" position="TE">guy</person> added 15 pounds got a lot stronger this year he looks a lot different than he did last year as a freshman first and goal it s edmonds in the i formation he s got it troy edmonds muscles here that go line stop half yard short now if youre virginia tech you start thinking about just taking your time here you want to work that clock as bad as ohio state s look these last few series remember they still are quick striking offense take your time in the huddle you work the clock down here at the half yard line so we got the two timeouts exactly what theyre doing same formation edmonds again same result stop short itll be third down and now beamer will have to spend the first of his timeouts and one left now 21 seconds<person player="raekwon mcmillan" race="UNK" position="LB">raekwon mcmillan</person>hammered him that is a heck of an effort when the football is on the half yard line<person player="raekwon mcmillan" race="UNK" position="LB">raekwon mcmillan</person>cleans it up but it s the defensive line on the right side for ohio state getting low theyd end up pulling the guard it looks like he s gonna have a walk into the endzone <person player="tommy schutt" race="UNK" position="DL">tommy</person> shut just throws his left shoulder left arm up into the air i think he s slowed him down a bit but it was the linebackers that eventually cleaned it up and kept him short but the defensive line anytime you have a great goal line played by a defense the defensive line gets low and they end up pushing that offensive line back and it frees up the linebackers to be clean and make a play they lost a half yard so the <person player="warren ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> at the one on third down how big is this play while state can can make a stand and for though keyes had 1st and goal to to force a field goal attempt theyll still have the lead fork attack a chance to come from 14 down in a hurry and lead at the break these are the drills you do throughout the entire month of august and you get ready for the season and now youre out here in a game and youre doing a goal line where it really really counts especially at this point the football game it s edmonds offset now <person player="michael brewer" race="UNK" position="QB">brewer</person> look to throw lobs it back to a wideopen friday at orion <person player="malik hooker" race="UNK" position="S">malik</person> and a lowkey team that look overmatched in the first quarter has stormed back to take the lead what it called air by scott leffler sly here s the hokies a threepoint lead a cash in the fumble by elliot and moves 38 yards in four plays that s the right time to call this by scott left there there he is the offensive coordinator a great call on third down<person player="sam rogers" race="UNK" position="FB">sam rogers</person>it s been getting a lot of attention number 45 he s right here and you think if theyre gonna go the playaction their roll out here this is the way theyre gonna go but in fact it s a delay by <person player="malik hooker" race="UNK" position="S">malik</person> he ends up sliding right here and nobody even sees him see that <person player="sam rogers" race="UNK" position="FB">rogers</person> going out into the flat you gotta back out there the defense is going out there you freeze it right here you can see nobody is back here the defense s over here <person player="malik hooker" race="UNK" position="S">malik</person> s waiting an easy throw and it s the right call by leffler to do that on third down and scott leffler very fired up but he plays ohio cities and ohio native he believed he was at that school of art worth it as they grubb machine and and it was an assistant obviously for urban <person player="charley meyer" race="UNK" position="WR">meyer</person> as well at florida this is what set it up the fumble punt by <person player="ezekiel elliott" race="nonwhite" position="RB">elliott</person> being asked to do something he hasnt done before yeah miscues bio state missed a field goal dropped the punt had some penalties and as good as their first quarter look 14 to nothing on the road virginia tech is <person player="isaiah ford" race="UNK" position="WR">ford</person> 17 in the second quarter in ohio state has not been able to get anything going offensively for <person player="jaylen bradshaw" race="UNK" position="WR">jaylen</person> marshall watching back home was suspended youre not feeling great about that that should have been him back there receiving the pun <person player="ezekiel elliott" race="nonwhite" position="RB">elliott</person> has done in high school but this is real different jalen again<person player="joey bosa" race="UNK" position="DL">joey bosa</person>he s the focus because he s an allamerican he s such a great player but jalen marshall and<person player="dontre wilson" race="UNK" position="RB">dontre wilson</person>both obviously missed pickup just drilled to the end zone and by the way we talked about how would the receivers do without those players we knew about<person player="michael thomas" race="nonwhite" position="WR">michael thomas</person>the receivers as a group have three receptions in his first half theyve been trying to get the <person player="warren ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> thrown a lot to <person player="ezekiel elliott" race="nonwhite" position="RB">elliott</person> butts<person player="curtis samuel" race="UNK" position="RB">curtis samuel</person>has one<person player="braxton miller" race="UNK" position="WR">braxton miller</person>has one<person player="michael thomas" race="nonwhite" position="WR">michael thomas</person>with one does harris <person player="parris campbell" race="UNK" position="WR">campbell</person> as a couple of drops one wasnt his fault the other one of unreviewable play because it was ruled incomplete in the field perhaps was a catch but 15 seconds to go big arm did they take a shot downfield against a higherrisk defense there is a very deep safety in this play instead it s <person player="ezekiel elliott" race="nonwhite" position="RB">elliott</person> who s dangerous anytime he touches it zigging and zagging for about 9 min real high o state deferred in the first half virginia tech had the <person player="warren ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> to start the game so ohio state hits the <person player="warren ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> to start the second half well urban <person player="charley meyer" race="UNK" position="WR">meyer</person> s team looked dominant coming in here ranked number one defending national champions and rolled to a 14 nothing lead but ten points for tech off of to ohio state turnovers the hokies at home of 1714 to heather cox with urban chris thank you coach quick 14o start now you go into the locker room down what s the biggest puzzle you have to solve in big games you know playing a good defense and their opportunities to offense to turnovers you know to turnovers you drop that punt so what we regroup come back out and play hard second half you work with<person player="cardale jones" race="nonwhite" position="QB">cardale jones</person>to start the game how would you assess his first half execution started off good you know we are were having you know you think about the misfires we had on those holding penalties so i think card i was doing okay but we might get the other one ready too the other one is<person player="jt barrett" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jt barrett</person>jones 6 of 13 with a touchdown and an interception he s also carried at eight times so <person player="michael brewer" race="UNK" position="QB">brewer</person> and the hokies ran abita number one team for the first time in program history of 1714 at the break and welcome back to college football primetime presented by capital one buckeyes came in tulane stadium scored 14 points quickly in the first quarter but the hokies closed with a 17 zip running in the second quarter<person player="michael brewer" race="UNK" position="QB">michael brewer</person>empty lucemon it s a mess drives kirk and chippy <person player="luke morgan" race="UNK" position="QB">luke</person> brings us tonight ohio state ohio state s miscues here a fake after<person player="cardale jones" race="nonwhite" position="QB">cardale jones</person>touchdown for a holy thought open 21 to nothing hit pass after a hokie touchdown then you have a drop punt jigna text appearing back they go down and <person player="michael brewer" race="UNK" position="QB">brewer</person> ends up getting the touchdown here they take of 1714 lead but ohio state up 14 to nothing and everything was going well for<person player="cardale jones" race="nonwhite" position="QB">cardale jones</person>there was a turning point the game in the miscues at urban <person player="charley meyer" race="UNK" position="WR">meyer</person> s talked to heather cox about walking off the field the first half ended up catching up to them and giving the hope you second life and they were able to capitalize on let s get equal sign now had the route frank beamer frank beamer said that the defense have to keep the run off the perimeter theyve got to fourth ohio state to throw i also must feel about brendon <person player="brenden motley" race="UNK" position="QB">motley</person> and he said he will continue to use him in the second half at times he said that the big body he changes the tempo and changes the look kind of mixing things up for ohio state s defense ohio state s offense will get the <person player="warren ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> back to begin the second half the edmonds brothers may not get much action to pick because these kickoffs for flying beyond the end line i love the chess match here grab my my props this is a stuff that herb admire drew up about his offense against bud foster s defense couple weeks ago he loves the x s and o s but what do you do against the bears here this is bud foster yet the day drawn up his version of itself wed love to go to school with his coaches your evaluation so far the chess match well the bear defense last year gave ohio state bits theyve had an entire offseason to kind of get their offense ready it started great for<person player="cardale jones" race="nonwhite" position="QB">cardale jones</person>in ohio state but now weve seen scene adjustments dooba good bud foster in the hokies defense and credit for sticking to their guns and not getting away from who they are here they are again with that pressure look this is <person player="braxton miller" race="UNK" position="WR">miller</person> little pop pass around the edge got three the difference ive seen with ohio state having the football has been up front in the first two or three possessions ohio state still was able to have some room to work with whether it was jones when he had time to throw or the running backs he kelly when he broke through and had some some room to run with we saw it just be a lot of domination up front the trenches in the last three possession that s not been the case jones another keeper eliot and lead block and jones sidesteps attack luring gets out across the 45 their zeke <person player="ezekiel elliott" race="nonwhite" position="RB">elliott</person> again without the football being physical and jones cuts underneath that block from see kelly people want to see him get the <person player="warren ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> but with the front that theyre playing it s hard to always get the <person player="warren ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> to the running back because there s so many defenders up in the box so that s why zeke le it has to be more of a receiver tonight then eventually mix him into the run game that time a great block to free up jones with a running man jones says double the number of carries so far as <person player="ezekiel elliott" race="nonwhite" position="RB">elliott</person> looks to throw loops it downfield practice <person player="braxton miller" race="UNK" position="WR">miller</person> makes the catch takes a man and scores and quiets the crowd after his first touchdown as a receiver in his brilliant career i can live on the edge youre gonna make plays everyone s gonna get excited and then youre gonna give up big plays watch this this is a matchup you will take every time if youre ohio state<person player="braxton miller" race="UNK" position="WR">braxton miller</person>with his quickness against the safety<person player="desmond frye" race="UNK" position="S">desmond frye</person>six to two hundred pounds and when you give him that kind of cushion off of the line of scrimmage there s no way that fry s going to be able to stay with him out in space like that what about guys a minute 7 to cover 75 yards and three plays and regain the lead i mean <person player="jack willoughby" race="UNK" position="K">willoughby</person> makes it 21:17 it was sitting to see how<person player="braxton miller" race="UNK" position="WR">braxton miller</person>was going to be used in this offense it has so many playmakers and now you see why they were excited about this position ship for this <person player="guy ferrelli" race="UNK" position="TE">guy</person> well yeah and when you put him at the age he doesnt have to be perfect with his technique as far as being able to get off the line of scrimmage the way some of the other receivers on the outside like a<person player="michael thomas" race="nonwhite" position="WR">michael thomas</person>would be theyd have him off the line as an age you can motion him you can move around and it allows him to have a free release and if you let him with his speed and quickness go up against a safety and you let him get to the outside like that but i dont know if there s a safety in the country that can stay with<person player="braxton miller" race="UNK" position="WR">braxton miller</person>oneonone coverage there s nobody helping <person player="desmond frye" race="UNK" position="S">frye</person> back there behind him you can see losing devin smith jeff harmon the tight end evan spencer was a veteran an excellent blocker and could catch some passes as we saw in the championship and you add in marshall <person player="dontre wilson" race="UNK" position="RB">wilson</person> and smith suspended and<person player="noah brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">noah brown</person>has counted on for a big giri worked so hard broke his leg at the end of a practice in columbus as the season approached so number one and also<person player="curtis samuel" race="UNK" position="RB">curtis samuel</person>number four figure to be very important especially tonight with the suspensions yeah yeah with the suspensions tonight it was a big thing coming in a lot of talent on the outside but not a lot of experience it s except for number three right there<person player="michael thomas" race="nonwhite" position="WR">michael thomas</person>cool to see<person player="jt barrett" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jt barrett</person>again down there right in the middle of it congratulating<person player="cardale jones" race="nonwhite" position="QB">cardale jones</person>this is jajuan green well take a knee<person player="michael brewer" race="UNK" position="QB">michael brewer</person>he took a big shot late in the first half he got sandwiched between two buckeyes was asked by at sema how you doing in halftime in the locker room from the tough <person player="guy ferrelli" race="UNK" position="TE">guy</person> quarterback we talked about he s from texas right grow up in texas he s a baller he just loves this game he s like equivalent to of being a gym rat when you play hoops he loves this game and he he took hits last year every single week as he said it is gonna take a heck of a lot more than that to take him out of this game see the adjustments from these two teams after virginia tech started to play a lot better there in his in that second quarter <person player="michael brewer" race="UNK" position="QB">brewer</person> has time in the pocket delivers the mallet to cut the tight end touchdown earlier i took it it s a good call here on first and ten the reason it s a good call is they had some success in the first half with <person player="malik hooker" race="UNK" position="S">malik</person> right over the middle in between those two linebackers and theyre very confident with that playing gives them short yardage here and that means diversa though these are using some tempo tonight the tempo from virginia tech would be different from some of the other tempos that you see when you watch college football theyre not going to make a living tempo tempo tempo the way baelor might do that but with the reason theyre going tempo is anything they can do to try to wear down the ohio state defense or to create some miscommunication or take away their aggressiveness try to get them on their heels is what theyre trying to do <person player="michael brewer" race="UNK" position="QB">brewer</person> as lots of time flips it over the middle that s made and edmonds stopped at the 45 my <person player="harry lewis" race="UNK" position="DT">harry</person> burden too i was almost like a a slip screen they had so much time and theyve been hitting the beast too tight in behind the linebackers could see it back here that opening when they took it away so they just checks it down when quick gun third down and they convert edmonds darts forward so a couple of first hours of the hokies are in buckeye territory all of a sudden you create some momentum and you create a rhythm now they are going a little bit quicker here edmonds again it s his way to the corner and picks up seven before he s knocked down by <person player="eli apple" race="UNK" position="CB">apple</person> that s where you would miss<person player="joey bosa" race="UNK" position="DL">joey bosa</person>right there<person player="joey bosa" race="UNK" position="DL">joey bosa</person>is known for his ability to russian quarterback but <person player="sam hubbard" race="white" position="DE">hubbard</person> that time was not able to seal the edge they got outside of <person player="sam hubbard" race="white" position="DE">hubbard</person> who s learning tonight on the fly as a <person player="trent young" race="UNK" position="LB">young</person> player as a freshman<person player="joey bosa" race="UNK" position="DL">joey bosa</person>is very disruptive against the run edmonds again hit in the backfield and smothered a tackle for loss is<person player="michael hill" race="UNK" position="DL">michael hill</person>is a reserve tackle makes a play and they said he had a great camp the sophomore out of south carolina said they got his weight down kind of asked the coaches of all the defenders you know you always have one that s <person player="luke morgan" race="UNK" position="QB">luke</person> fickle and chris ash who was that <person player="guy ferrelli" race="UNK" position="TE">guy</person> that kind of surprised you because of his effort in the offseason in the weight room we both said<person player="michael hill" race="UNK" position="DL">michael hill</person>number 77<person player="jc coleman" race="UNK" position="RB">jc coleman</person>back in the game on third and four ruhr steps up takes a hit delivers over the head <person player="malik hooker" race="UNK" position="S">malik</person> the blitz came and knocked him down man he is holding his left shoulder office <person player="adolphus washington" race="UNK" position="DL">washington</person> hit him and i dont care how tough you are <person player="adolphus washington" race="UNK" position="DL">washington</person> at 300 pounds can deliver a blow they brought the pressure from <person player="joshua perry" race="UNK" position="LB">perry</person> up the middle but he gets picked up but they dont are not able to sustain the block there on the one of the better defensive linemen on this ohio state team <person player="adolphus washington" race="UNK" position="DL">washington</person> is a big man and he got a clean hit on <person player="michael brewer" race="UNK" position="QB">brewer</person> he got slammed to the ground the non throwing shoulder but he came off very quickly so now well see brendon <person player="brenden motley" race="UNK" position="QB">motley</person> heather talked to frank beamer about him when they get the <person player="warren ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> back this may be his game that did not look good for <person player="michael brewer" race="UNK" position="QB">brewer</person> well heather s report talked about how he comes in as a changeup we noticed that more of an athletic <person player="guy ferrelli" race="UNK" position="TE">guy</person> who wants to run and <person player="michael brewer" race="UNK" position="QB">brewer</person> is gonna go straight looks like he might go straight in have that shoulder looked at but molly did not really the passer beamer with montly elects not to go for it on fourth and four from the 43 so <person player="aj hughes" race="UNK" position="P">hughes</person> drops the tip eliot this time just clears out looks at balance a flag is down and the hokies will down it at the five there are three markers on the field boy sprayed in <person player="michael brewer" race="UNK" position="QB">brewer</person> senior bearing the kick holding number 92 on the receiving team after this is to the goal from the end of the kick first down the <person player="adolphus washington" race="UNK" position="DL">washington</person> who just knocked the quarterback to the ground and out for the moment guilty of the penalty a novak ohio state up means they take over up for welcome back to virginia tech where you just saw their quarterback<person player="michael brewer" race="UNK" position="QB">michael brewer</person>head to the locker room where he is being evaluated by head up blood sugar might go forth the news on him grits not return oh an injury look for brendon <person player="brenden motley" race="UNK" position="QB">motley</person> in its place neither thank you very tough news for the hokie fans as the buckeyes take over backed up with the two and feed elliot straight ahead boy kirk it has been a tough opening weekend for injuries that are serious variety stars all over the place taysom hill and py is hail mary win out for the season torian bolson is a key loss for notre dame a running back <person player="james clark" race="UNK" position="WR">james</person> <person player="connor kish" race="UNK" position="OL">connor</person> hit very good scoobies right to think what four to five weeks maybe one of the best defensive players in the country and now you add to the list<person player="michael brewer" race="UNK" position="QB">michael brewer</person>from virginia tech we built here entire offseason around his his abilities elliot nothing has dropped for 1/2 yard gain by chucky clark he will be third down not to get too technical because im sure there are people at home saying why isnt zeke elliot running the football maury only at eight carries last year why arent they giving it to amore at the long run the reason is to get the defensive scheme that virginia tech plays they play with a nose guard right over the center they cover both of the guards from ohio state it doesnt allow them to be able to block and then get up to the linebackers it s very very tough to run your running back against this game braxton at quarterback on third and four as it takes a not escape dropped for a loss by <person player="luther maddy" race="UNK" position="DT">luther</person> matty so the buckeyes backed up with the penalty worse to a three and out and right now theyre getting off blocks and planting with confidence such a different look there in that bear front still but look at the penetration look at 92 maddie get in there he had a big game a year ago against ohio state along with nichols right now this defense is in beast mode pin in their ears back and just kidding after they had the line of scrimmage first green out for the buckeyes like strowman does not come up to feel this it s not a good punt the back spins will move it to the 42 yard line actually now closer to the 41 and now well get a look at brendon <person player="brenden motley" race="UNK" position="QB">motley</person> knowing that he s got to take it the distance if he can because he s not a change of pace <person player="guy ferrelli" race="UNK" position="TE">guy</person> kirk who s just gonna run it a couple times he s gonna have to do you think some things in the passing game well we talked when he got in that when he comes in ohio state s defense theyre thinking completely about zone read and quarterback run game and we talked about how he should have to throw some to give them something else to think about well now with <person player="michael brewer" race="UNK" position="QB">brewer</person> out were gonna have to see more than just quarterback run and run game from him hasnt yet thrown a pass in his career they fake it to a true freshman and now throw it to him and has off the hands of trayvon macmillan who tried to make it a high percentage throw but you know the adrenaline s got to be 400 yes he s gonna have to set away and urban <person player="charley meyer" race="UNK" position="WR">meyer</person> you can see the top of the screen going crazy he s still working the official over and has everything to do with<person player="bucky hodges" race="nonwhite" position="TE">bucky hodges</person>that time on a block was actually locked on to bond bell that s why he was right in front of him and that s what had him worked up and so excited he let the official know about it youre fine to block when the <person player="warren ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> is thrown behind the line of scrimmage but you cant engage and grab on to the shoulders challenge now for scott left were calling the plays what could <person player="brenden motley" race="UNK" position="QB">motley</person> execute while they hand it off instead and coleman barrels for creates a third and for scott leffler is you always think as a coordinator about worstcase scenarios you think about brewers our <person player="guy ferrelli" race="UNK" position="TE">guy</person> we got into this game plan were gonna put it together and then you get into a game and you still think about okay if he goes down guys as a staff what do we do what s our plan with <person player="brenden motley" race="UNK" position="QB">motley</person> what are we gonna do if he s the <person player="guy ferrelli" race="UNK" position="TE">guy</person> do we think about<person player="chris durkin" race="UNK" position="QB">chris durkin</person>who s a freshman out of youngstown ohio he played it youngstown ursuline do you think about possibly him coming in but right now it looks like this game is in the hands of brandon <person player="brenden motley" race="UNK" position="QB">motley</person> who s from christiansburg just down the road few miles from the campus on third and down <person player="brenden motley" race="UNK" position="QB">motley</person> cannot escape believe his knee was down initially <person player="tommy schutt" race="UNK" position="DL">tommy</person> shut the tackle on the pressure and they dropped him way back at the 44 his knees went to the ground and that killed the play right there and theyre trying to affect up you have an inexperienced quarterback they did some twisting up front youre trying to affect his eyes an athletic quarterback does not like to sit in the pocket on third down and a way you can really take advantage of that is crossing your defensive lineman and blitzing linebackers get him a different color jersey to flash in front of his eyes it can really affect his accuracy and his decisionmaking it s like juan luis involved in the pressure so the hokies unable to cash in on very good field position the new quarterback and <person player="aj hughes" race="UNK" position="P">hughes</person> will again try to pin the buckeyes back <person player="ezekiel elliott"

position="DL">washington</person> taking him out on that pressure at the reporting it s a collarbone injury same play coming to the left this time fakie they hand it to elliot who bounces it to bring down he does get a first down at the 30 for ohio state giving the exact same look the formation into the boundary with their receivers and then faking this time that little quick little pitch to <person player="curtis samuel" race="UNK" position="RB">samuel</person> and try to get any anything they can do to give zeki elliot a little bit of room to work with he had the one long run but he broke a couple arm tackles to get there it s been a quiet night other than the long run elliot s been blocking for jones got hell try to return the favor throw a block on the linebacker there <person player="curtis samuel" race="UNK" position="RB">samuel</person> in motion again flag comes down he picks up six <person player="curtis samuel" race="UNK" position="RB">samuel</person> was a brilliant player in erasmus hall high school in brooklyn 37 yards still first down 20 of em dyck and he came and the coaching staff just loving <person player="curtis samuel" race="UNK" position="RB">samuel</person> and because he wasnt getting enough carries behind elliot they wanted to find a way to get in the <person player="warren ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> in situations like that you hear coaches say we need to get her best players on the field that s the classic example with with <person player="curtis samuel" race="UNK" position="RB">samuel</person> they just i didnt even last year every maier knew he was one of his better skilled players he had an entire offseason and learned that each position along with<person player="braxton miller" race="UNK"

has it great penetration and he s muscle down by <person player="luther maddy" race="UNK" position="DT">luther</person> matty four plays in a row where they ran basically the jet sweep comes around twice they gave it to<person player="curtis samuel" race="UNK" position="RB">curtis samuel</person>a couple times theyve given it now to<person player="braxton miller" race="UNK" position="WR">braxton miller</person>and <person player="luther maddy" race="UNK" position="DT">maddy</person> with the penetration is able to get in there put on first and five maybe maybe ed <person player="luke morgan" race="UNK" position="QB">morgan</person> would take a shot downfield you got here s the matchup let me see if i can show you here youve got<person player="braxton miller" race="UNK" position="WR">braxton miller</person>where he was earlier right here matched up oneonone there s no safeties behind him knowns the roles but sit back and knock down short of the mark it would be third and one<person player="chuck clark" race="UNK" position="CB">chuck clark</person>a part of this the chess match between urban <person player="charley meyer" race="UNK" position="WR">meyer</person> and his offensive staff and on the other side you have bud foster is urban s trying to think of different formations and he has guys upstairs looking down to see okay with that formation of the boundary theyre reacting like this if we get this matchup oneonone were going to go back to it theyre going to go back to<person player="braxton miller" race="UNK" position="WR">braxton miller</person>at some point again if he gets with left oneonone again with the sophomore<person player="greg stroman" race="UNK" position="WR">greg stroman</person>number three not necessarily here on third down but at some point theyre going to go back to that default bunch formation to the left i snap jones in trouble knock down short and a high snap disrupted the timing in the hokies blew into the backfield he was lucky to secure the football this thing almost went sailing right over top of his head but get cory marshall the senior who s an explosive <person player="guy ferrelli" race="UNK" position="TE">guy</person> out frenzy he was able to hold on to that football but he s the one who got the penetration and made<person player="cardale jones" race="nonwhite" position="QB">cardale jones</person>have to redirect and come back he kind of aborted the option because of the bad snap and then by the time he came back marshall was right there ready to make the play the buckeyes as flags come down before the punt buckeyes had a first seen five after that offside penalty and couldnt get a first down the chicago bear defense has gotten so much attention because of what virginia tech did the ohio state a year ago theyre bringing that same defense in tonight im gonna tell you it s not just this scheme it s the guys running the scheme this is a very very talented front that deep the virginia tech has <person player="cameron johnston" race="white" position="P">johnston</person> boots it away it s a good kicking <person player="greg stroman" race="UNK" position="WR">stroman</person> backpedals no fair catch it immediately at the 25yard line harris <person player="parris campbell" race="UNK" position="WR">campbell</person> the receiver who drifts got flake with a penalty flew down and made a nice tackle trying to make amends here right they put starters on their special teams look at look at the penetration there there s nowhere to go for<person player="cardale jones" race="nonwhite" position="QB">cardale jones</person>remember tonight on helmet sticker is a boat virginia tech and ohio state the two television journalists who were killed alison <person player="parker osterloh" race="UNK" position="OL">parker</person> and adam ward channel 7 in roanoke just down the road from blacksburg that was a moment of silence honoring their memory before the game tonight hokies take over <person player="brenden motley" race="UNK" position="QB">motley</person> delivers a low throw and it is complete to <person player="raekwon mcmillan" race="UNK" position="LB">mcmillan</person> were talking at the break there s scott leffler and all of a sudden brewers out you got with <person player="brenden motley" race="UNK" position="QB">motley</person> who s not necessarily a proven passer and leffler i think has to change completely his game plan because brewers ability to throw and <person player="brenden motley" race="UNK" position="QB">motley</person> more of a runner and i think the passing game changes you just saw a simple little throw it s easy reads its bootlegs things that can get him out on the corner where you can dump it out to<person player="sam rogers" race="UNK" position="FB">sam rogers</person>and maybe the tight in out in the flat but keep the read simple and avoid sitting back in that pocket has been on the football team for three years but at one completion in his career before this year coleman darts back ran into a blocker that picks up a game that s a yards short of the marker at the 34 theyre down the blocker was his quarterback brandon <person player="brenden motley" race="UNK" position="QB">motley</person> so appreciate that watch <person player="brenden motley" race="UNK" position="QB">motley</person> he after he hands it off the <person player="warren ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> bounces back he s carrying it a fake and he says i let me try to help you out get somebody tries me he does hit punk bellies im not gonna leave but ill go get the safety dont move to change he s locked into vaughn bell there but imagine kirk what s going through his head he knew in the game plan that he could come in as a change of pace <person player="guy ferrelli" race="UNK" position="TE">guy</person> but he never obviously expected this and here s the defending champs number one team i think i think youre always thinking about and if youre doing it the right way as a staff youre always thinking about youre a play away and mentally even though youre not the starter youve got to act like youre starting your preparation <person player="brenden motley" race="UNK" position="QB">motley</person> again off his back foot throws it out there well defended his flag came in i was fondly in the area against<person player="bucky hodges" race="nonwhite" position="TE">bucky hodges</person>i think <person player="gareon conley" race="UNK" position="CB">conley</person> lute uses his left hand to climb the ladder was it a lot of contact but i think he prevented fast enough aaron rodgers from going up that kind of gets around his shoulder pad <person player="bucky hodges" race="nonwhite" position="TE">hodges</person> has not made a catch tonight that s a surprise but he does draw the flag by the way he kind of way with one you know yeah i dont want to just float it up even though he s thinking <person player="bucky hodges" race="nonwhite" position="TE">hodges</person> at six seven can make the play if i put it up in the air still a dangerous throw this handles snap and <person player="raekwon mcmillan" race="UNK" position="LB">mcmillan</person> muscles forward <person player="warren ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> comes out <person player="eli apple" race="UNK" position="CB">apple</person> picks it up for ohio state a turnover the first of the night for tech you know go high oh state defenders ripping at the <person player="warren ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> it looks like<person player="sam hubbard" race="white" position="DE">sam hubbard</person>might have gotten in there and tried to pull it out and it s gonna come down to was the <person player="warren ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> out before his knee touched coleman hoping he was down checking the replay screen right now he looks like he s still up unless there is a replay thatll show his one of his knees down initial contact by <person player="jalyn holmes" race="UNK" position="DL">holmes</person> actually it is <person player="jalyn holmes" race="UNK" position="DL">holmes</person> who looks like his body it s still off the ground it s like he s laying on top of defendant<person player="michael hill" race="UNK" position="DL">michael hill</person>was holding him up you see a knee touch has to be elusive evidence to overturn the call jalen <person player="jalyn holmes" race="UNK" position="DL">holmes</person> has a hold of him and he s got a hold of the football right there he rips it out yeah i dont think the knees have been that s a fumble and that would be a crushing fumble if the call stands hokies had not committed a turnover tonight and this will set up ohio state near midfield well take a break while they review it<person player="jc coleman" race="UNK" position="RB">jc coleman</person>dc commoner who is spotted wearing a gold watch they didnt they didnt grab his watch but they did grab the <person player="warren ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> and the call of fumble and well stand yeah he never touched it he was laying on top of ohio state defenders while the <person player="warren ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> came out again it was a really good job there by jalen <person player="jalyn holmes" race="UNK" position="DL">holmes</person> who had a hold of that football the entire time incidentally from norfolk virginia jalen <person player="jalyn holmes" race="UNK" position="DL">holmes</person> with it go on sing reggie rover used to wear this man running backwards watching the game most tennis players who wear one get paid for it <person player="braxton miller" race="UNK" position="WR">miller</person> in the shotgun gets free on the edge<person player="braxton miller" race="UNK" position="WR">braxton miller</person>s loose pin roll for the end zone do you think he s made an impact that his first came an hback wow again i think people forgot how explosive<person player="braxton miller" race="UNK" position="WR">braxton miller</person>is with the football in his hands when you get him out in the edge and you give him a little bit of room this is what he can do to not just virginia tech but anybody ohio state plays watch his spin move i think in the madden that might be the b button that s a nice spin move there nobody put a finger on him with that spin move but a great block by<person player="parris campbell" race="UNK" position="WR">parris campbell</person>downfield that gave him the room to get the yards and eventually build up that speed so <person player="braxton miller" race="UNK" position="WR">miller</person> has had a pair of 50yard touchdowns caught one earlier then shifts back to his old position to quarterback and runs for a 50yard touched what did you and i talked about in the way over the game today we said with all the talk of<person player="cardale jones" race="nonwhite" position="QB">cardale jones</person>and<person player="jt barrett" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jt barrett</person>i have a give you credit you said it get the one tonight with the <person player="warren ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> in his hands way it was receiving or just getting out on the edge just two years ago he was at times one of the that was two years ago he s one of the more explosive players it as a quarterback you knew when he would have a chance to get out and play with seaver hed be doing some it is he s beautiful it s at committees 60 and he s only going to get better with the more reps that he gets out on the edge but urban <person player="charley meyer" race="UNK" position="WR">meyer</person> give him and ed warner and that offensive staff credit for coming up with ways they eased him in early in his game and the more more he s kind of settled in the more theyve given him a chance to make plays can be very fun throughout the season to see this role evolve this is only opening night two receptions for 78 yards five carries 58 yards it s not a bad night it s been all about explosive plays but this will house a defense <person player="braxton miller" race="UNK" position="WR">miller</person> a pair of 50yard touchdowns <person player="ezekiel elliott" race="nonwhite" position="RB">elliott</person> the 80yard run and the hole just got a lot deeper for the hokies who came from 14 down to take the lead but that was with <person player="michael brewer" race="UNK" position="QB">brewer</person> at quarterback now theyve totally inexperienced brendan <person player="brenden motley" race="UNK" position="QB">motley</person> will have to find a way to bring the hokies back if he can 2:05 in the third quarter and the injury to breuer really brought the energy out of the stadium it was rocking even after the buckeyes had taking the lead tech was marching and the injury to their quarterback has brought everybody down mcmillon hammered hard just across the 15 immediately after our game kirk our buddy svp taking his towns to midnight is take and sports ed itll still be scores in highlights but with a twist like youve never seen it before the premiere is tonight he s gonna have a little flair right let s be pete flair do it how about one day have to have this <person player="guy ferrelli" race="UNK" position="TE">guy</person> on his show go personality a little spin this one past two guys youre right that was a video game with im not able to push that button execute it but those gamers out there recognize that might be the square button what can they <person player="justin cook" race="UNK" position="QB">cook</person> up to make <person player="brenden motley" race="UNK" position="QB">motley</person> comfortable that will get some traction against this ohio state defense short gain by edmonds on first down when you go back to work virginia tech s showed a lot of grit and toughness when they got down 49 oh that was that without<person player="michael brewer" race="UNK" position="QB">michael brewer</person>but they kept fighting they down 14 in the first quarter again theyll feed <person player="raekwon mcmillan" race="UNK" position="LB">mcmillan</person> itll be third down very very different look that scott leffler is gone too with<person player="michael brewer" race="UNK" position="QB">michael brewer</person>here icing down that left shoulder correction that was edmonds on the carry much easier attack to defend pro hi oh state without a true threat in the passing game most of their plan was about trying to win someone on once on the outside to get backed up running the football but right now hi oh state not really respecting or fearing that passing game with <person player="brenden motley" race="UNK" position="QB">motley</person> in there three receivers in the fullback <person player="sam rogers" race="UNK" position="FB">rogers</person> in the backfield montlake escapes my side step and he spins for a first down to the 30 recruited more as an athlete by most teams in the country not a quarterback and you can see maybe in that<person player="braxton miller" race="UNK" position="WR">braxton miller</person>but it he showed a little wiggle there yeah and that might be their best opportunity on third down is he drops back and people were covered and he takes off that time he got around<person player="raekwon mcmillan" race="UNK" position="LB">raekwon mcmillan</person>about a yard short of the first down got around him and picked that first down up final minute of the quarter <person player="raekwon mcmillan" race="UNK" position="LB">mcmillan</person> cant get the edge knocked for a loss dolphus <person player="adolphus washington" race="UNK" position="DL">washington</person> really beginning to impose himself right now you have 11 white jerseys when the <person player="warren ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> is snapped running into the run game and theyve got guys taken away the quarterback and the running back next monday nfl has this stage mike tirico and john bruton will be in atlanta or chip kelly and the falcons kickoff the doubleheader monday night hem down at five oclock and then it s the vikings at the niners doubleheader blanchin nonfirst down <person player="brenden motley" race="UNK" position="QB">motley</person> looking long four forward into double coverage and it s picked off tie this <person player="tyvis powell" race="UNK" position="S">powell</person> came across and grabbed the football<person player="sam hubbard" race="white" position="DE">sam hubbard</person>to fill in for both of pressure at the quarterback and now backtoback possessions indian turnovers five is pal here just plays backyard football he just sits back and reads this the entire way like the call like the idea to try to take a chance to get the <person player="warren ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> thrown downfield they show cover to pals here and hell work to the middle and then just read the quarterback size and come over and make the play hell sink back into coverage see how he s getting back here and getting back the entire time he just and by the way he s got probably the best <person player="warren ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> skills of anybody in that secondary went up in high point in that football calmly right there stride for stride as well with four it took a shot downfield with the <person player="trent young" race="UNK" position="LB">young</person> quarterback with the coleman fumble cashed in and now the interception in the final play of the third quarter <person player="ezekiel elliott" race="nonwhite" position="RB">elliott</person> mishandled the snap was lucky to come up with it dropped for no gain by van dyke so end of the third quarter and ohio state scored 14 points after trailing at halftime including this filthy spin move by<person player="braxton miller" race="UNK" position="WR">braxton miller</person>for a 50 hart touchdown oh keys the buckeyes presented by capital one there s that ridiculous spin move by<person player="braxton miller" race="UNK" position="WR">braxton miller</person>who s got seven touches little shoutout the most famous ohio state fan in the world has to be lebron <person player="james clark" race="UNK" position="WR">james</person> it was on the field the buckeyes were upset at home last year in spite of the crowd twice after and the bronze lebron watching probably with his boys cheering like crazy i think all ohio state fans enjoy not just the impact on the game but the renaissance the return of<person player="braxton miller" race="UNK" position="WR">braxton miller</person>it was such a soldier for three years in this program i had to sit out the championship year a year ago is this man jones starred and at the last second he puts the <person player="warren ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> down field johnny <person player="johnnie dixon" race="UNK" position="WR">dixon</person> is wide open he s finally corralled as <person player="johnnie dixon" race="UNK" position="WR">dixon</person> his first career catch how about this by jones you could see that johnny <person player="johnnie dixon" race="UNK" position="WR">dixon</person> broke away but this is arm strength and recognition i thought he might give up on the play and just end up trying to pick up two or three yards on the scramble he breaks containing it gets outside looked at the top of your screen right there you could see the defender gave up on it and came in on <person player="donovan riley" race="UNK" position="S">riley</person> who had the big pick six last year against ohio state but a jump pass and gets the <person player="warren ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> about 30 yards downfield to johnny <person player="johnnie dixon" race="UNK" position="WR">dixon</person> <person player="johnnie dixon" race="UNK" position="WR">dixon</person> one of those receivers making his debut tonight trying to make an impact on this coaching staff <person player="braxton miller" race="UNK" position="WR">miller</person> in the backfield takes a handoff and you think he cant do in a football field boy one defense for a couple snaps when you have<person player="braxton miller" race="UNK" position="WR">braxton miller</person>and<person player="curtis samuel" race="UNK" position="RB">curtis samuel</person>it s amazing what you can do and as this season goes on itll be fun to watch to see how they grow and how they change because one moment they can be and you throw in jail and marshall eventually into that rotation these guys can line up in a lot of different positions so you cant really key on him and say okay he is an h bat he is a z he s a halfback there theyre everywhere they can be in fact that he could be a quarterback <person player="braxton miller" race="UNK" position="WR">miller</person> s got one season to do what he can for the buckeyes and also audition for the nfl at that position jones takes the shot dives forward <person player="desmond frye" race="UNK" position="S">desmond</person> fry knocked him down itll be third down h back as much in vogue in the nfl as it was but they see this kind of athlete well it has to be enticing the other thing is in urban <person player="charley meyer" race="UNK" position="WR">meyer</person> s offense whether it was at bowling green or utah or florida or now ohio state his usually his most special most versatile player plays that hvac and has a lot of success whether it s catching the <person player="warren ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> coming around on a jet sweep also being able to run the football when we saw percy harvin from a lot lost a lot of yards when he was down in gainesville lake like at four and third and three jones has a lot of time walking downfield<person player="michael thomas" race="nonwhite" position="WR">michael thomas</person>flags come in looping throw<person player="kendall fuller" race="UNK" position="CB">kendall fuller</person>against <person player="michael thomas" race="nonwhite" position="WR">thomas</person> speaking of nfl prospects weve been working against each other tonight pass interference defense number 11 15 yards first down<person player="kendall fuller" race="UNK" position="CB">kendall fuller</person>the youngest of the four <person player="kendall fuller" race="UNK" position="CB">fuller</person> brothers who all played at this brooklyn got a couple of big brothers or dbs and you see the head not turned around theyre gonna call that with the contact and with him not looking back for the football <person player="michael thomas" race="nonwhite" position="WR">thomas</person> got behind him did a good job of the second time he s gotten the best of<person player="kendall fuller" race="UNK" position="CB">kendall fuller</person>one of the top corners in the country pile <person player="vinny mihota" race="UNK" position="DT">vinny</person> cory is with the twitters receiver and now <person player="kendall fuller" race="UNK" position="CB">kendall</person> and sadly for okie fans that sit there anymore <person player="braxton miller" race="UNK" position="WR">miller</person> in motion jones looks back in his direction and now just fires it in the seats they wanted a wheel route but it was well covered more to <person player="eli apple" race="UNK" position="CB">apple</person> wonka pressured the quarterback lebron no doubt watching the game i see a little bro and practice another five hit it with the silencer he s hit him with two big plays this is just the beginning yeah his he was cooped up last year you imagine going through everything that he s been through the accomplishments he s been through there s a silencer from lebron is it missing you know as a quarterback you dont practice the same way as you arrive receiver he was sore the workload on those legs he was working so hard all summer to get ready for this new position they were worried he was going to overwork himself and get hurt and he did one second in the play clock and a timeout is called just before the flag would have been thrown on the sidelines so he was having to get used to that workload in practice and he that kind of had a hamstring and he was so explosive right until about last weekend took some time urban recognized that gave him a chance to recover and you can see tonight he s peaked at the right time rookies defense make a last stand here down 11 desperately need to get the <person player="warren ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> back and add further damage second and ten joan boyce s <person player="trent young" race="UNK" position="LB">young</person> <person player="denzel ward" race="UNK" position="CB">denzel</person> <person player="braxton miller" race="UNK" position="WR">miller</person> makes an adjustment dives but couldnt quite get it you knew theyre gonna go back to that that s the matchup that theyre looking for oneonone against the sophomores <person player="greg stroman" race="UNK" position="WR">stroman</person> favorable the difference between ohio state from last year against his defense and the confidence that they have now great job were reversing almost came up with a football the difference from a year ago is the quarterback and his ability to be protected and the way they can attack the <person player="warren ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> throwing the <person player="warren ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> downfield and that s without<person player="dontre wilson" race="UNK" position="RB">dontre wilson</person>and jalen marshall cory smith halftime <person player="charley meyer" race="UNK" position="WR">meyer</person> hinted that we might see <person player="jt barrett" race="nonwhite" position="QB">barrett</person> in the second half not so far third down hokies bring pressure late jones hit and a flag comes in as the <person player="warren ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> sailed over the head of <person player="michael thomas" race="nonwhite" position="WR">thomas</person> flag is in the secondary there s two of them it s going to be against virginia tech another interference call second this drive foster s defense really backed up now favorite rout of <person player="michael thomas" race="nonwhite" position="WR">thomas</person> s get to the inside and pulled on his jersey there crowd reacting after the interference but if im defending<person player="michael thomas" race="nonwhite" position="WR">michael thomas</person>im taking away his inside between last year and even tonight most of his success on those slants and posts to the inside and<person player="kendall fuller" race="UNK" position="CB">kendall fuller</person>their star corner out of the game ii limped off he wasnt in there to cover <person player="michael thomas" race="nonwhite" position="WR">thomas</person> that side they went right after him and now jones walks into the end zone and the buckeyes are pulling away and quite been able to get loose tonight but this time he s able to find some blocks and there s a nice crease and i think virginia tech starting to wear down a little bit physically and mentally there s the right guard el fine zeke <person player="ezekiel elliott" race="nonwhite" position="RB">elliott</person> with a nice block and because of the formation there s once they made those blocks at the line of scrimmage there s nobody left to stop jones from going into the end zone jones is a passer tonight 9 of 18 186 and two touchdown passes with the pick and now has a touchdown run he s rushed for 99 yards okay you wicked spirit the working the us open final the next saturday youll be in east lansing or get admission you can stay it s riffy ballgame well i say jump down to the 14nothing lead would you detected it terrific job put 17 on the board in the third quarter buckeyes reclaimed the lead to start the half and then michel <person player="michael brewer" race="UNK" position="QB">brewer</person> with a collarbone injury as nonthrowing side goes out and that really did change things for the worse in college football is a game of momentum ohio state had it early virginia tech able to capitalize on some ohio state miscues in that second quarter went in at halftime 1714 but youre right it was almost cement air came out of lane stadium when they had that entry from <person player="michael brewer" race="UNK" position="QB">brewer</person> and this this second half i think theyve theyve only had 26 yards since michael brokers but<person player="michael brewer" race="UNK" position="QB">michael brewer</person>has gone out of the lineup so it s just been a different way of trying to attack and they dont have that actually 20 yards they dont have that ability to throw the <person

share with me that xrays revealed that that left collarbone is broken now the tentative plan right now is to have surgery tomorrow to repair it doctors told him it s about a four to five weeks recovery period and then he choked with me in good spirit is that urban <person player="charley meyer" race="UNK" position="WR">meyer</person> dodged a bullet tonight well we certainly hope the surgery goes well four to five weeks means he could potentially return midseason for virginia tech s sake after the way their seasons at ghani s last two or three years you just hope he s back as quickly as possible in the meantime it s good to be the mottely showed darren lee hammered rodgers the fullback he was the mvp defensively in the sugar bowl i think i think really the last three games most notably the alabama game that you discussed about the oregon game he i dont know if there s a player that gained more confidence from last year in the beginning of the year is the first time starter to the end of the year than him on the defense i didnt think he had a very good game against the hokies a year ago and it was all pretty fast for but he s a different player now <person

linebacker stopped him itll be third down so high state defense going back to a couple years ago chris remember a lot of people question urban <person player="charley meyer" race="UNK" position="WR">meyer</person> and the defensive scheme they were a little bit conservative in their approach went out in the offseason going into the 2014 national championship season decided to become much more aggressive press man quarters coverage in the face of the receivers and they dictated things a lot more to offense as a year ago and then of course that trend will continue this year when <person player="brenden motley" race="UNK" position="QB">motley</person> under pressure flips it short it s a screen and edmonds couldnt come up with it well they emphasized tackling some new techniques before last year ended up being perhaps the best tackle on the team in the country and i think it used to be an emphasis how would you rate their performance tonight i think theyve been good but at the same time that i think theyve done enough for <person player="luke morgan" race="UNK" position="QB">luke</person> fickle to be able to get their attention you know that they played well but theyve given up some plays so i think if youre a highly ranked team it s it s nice to be able to win a game but if youre a coach secretly you win the game if you have some things we can go back to the film room and say you know hey guys it s a great win but look we we got a long way to go if you think were gonna become a dominant defense hue s one sitting down there eliot lets it bounce out of bounds will we see<person player="jt barrett" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jt barrett</person>he s been warming up the helmet is on and perhaps the man who filled in for <person

position="QB">barrett</person> not just in mapa because there arent enough talented offensive players in a pot i think urban <person player="charley meyer" race="UNK" position="WR">meyer</person> made it pretty clear that once he makes a decision he s going to go with that <person player="guy ferrelli" race="UNK" position="TE">guy</person> and it looks like it s gonna be<person player="cardale jones" race="nonwhite" position="QB">cardale jones</person>this one you love to see <person player="guy ferrelli" race="UNK" position="TE">guy</person> lost out first one to congratulate<person

the first sophomore in a history of a hundredyear over a hundred years ago hi o state football the first sophomore captain and probably will go on to be the only threetime captain at ohio state short game but it s sophomore captain think about that yeah theyve been some pretty good ones go through columbus tells you what his teammates think about him made it a point about do you think he s going to get some opportunities other than mopup duty it s so hard to look at the rest of their season and no but urban <person player="charley meyer" race="UNK" position="WR">meyer</person> has made it clear he s gonna pick a <person player="guy ferrelli" race="UNK" position="TE">guy</person> and he doesnt want him looking over his shoulder but he s gonna pick a <person player="guy ferrelli" race="UNK" position="TE">guy</person> and it s were going with you and that s the decision that he s made and<person player="jt barrett" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jt barrett</person>has come to

carrier <person player="jt barrett" race="nonwhite" position="QB">barrett</person> looking for the corner makes a huge play and c<person player="cardale jones" race="nonwhite" position="QB">cardale jones</person>can run the football but but that s probably more of a 10 yard gain or 15 yard gain and when you put 16 in there with<person player="jt barrett" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jt barrett</person>youve got a little bit more quickness see the entire game weve seen these outside linebackers dion clark and van dyck theyve been kind of baiting and trying to play a catandmouse game and it s been pretty effective against jones here you got a <person player="guy ferrelli" race="UNK" position="TE">guy</person> that s attacking downhill running option football and he goes down and picks up huge yards it s a 40 yard run yet another explosive play or miss ohio state offense <person player="jt barrett" race="nonwhite" position="QB">barrett</person> looks to throw and wide open for

a shortage of athletes on the <person player="warren ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> tonight for ohio state on often though <person player="brenden motley" race="UNK" position="QB">motley</person> white at midfield incomplete trying to get the <person player="warren ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> the<person player="bucky hodges" race="nonwhite" position="TE">bucky hodges</person>who has not been a factor tonight the but guys have taken away the talented side n yeah that s true and it starts to look at the bigger even the bigger picture chris their schedule the fbi has them what it 95 percent favored and almost every game they play until they get to michigan state right now it now is our friendly for so likes to say you practice against perfection that s what ohio state s gonna be doing for the next ten weeks nine week low snap and that play is going nowhere mother camp williams the fbi has been a very reliable predictor the outcome of games if you believe the folks who program and this is deemed their danger game only an 80% probability look at the three other nonconference games and then the big ten schedule opens up with games that theyll be heavily heavily favored and that s a doubledigit favorite in all those games and then michigan state november 21st will be a game worth watching when youre favored like that and you have a committee watching and you have critics thatll say look at that schedule look how easy it is but if you go out and dominate that schedule there s really nothing anybody consent <person player="brenden motley" race="UNK" position="QB">motley</person> yes early searching to make a play but he s knocked down again <person player="tommy schutt" race="UNK" position="DL">tommy</person> shut joining the sex parade<person player="joey bosa" race="UNK" position="DL">joey bosa</person>not there but the defensive line maybe not the spectacular things that boast he could do he delivered the big hit last year to force the fumble that set up the gametying touchdown but theyve been working like ineffective they have that time <person player="tommy schutt" race="UNK" position="DL">tommy</person> shut because of the coverage downfield was able to get in there and theyre asking <person player="tommy schutt" race="UNK" position="DL">tommy</person> shut to have a big senior year he came in there s a highly decorated high school player and hasnt quite lived up to that billing theyre hoping he could put it all together his senior year it s the fourth sack by the ohio state defense tonight long punt by <person player="aj hughes" race="UNK" position="P">hughes</person> goes out of bounds instead of six minutes if blacksburg but guys rolling kirk judo certain big fiveo this year yeah brutus is 50th birthday the original lee corso mascot selection the first time she asked they said no well yes before so asked to go back again second time somehow it got done they pitch it to <person player="curtis samuel" race="UNK" position="RB">samuel</person> on the edge brutus by the way getting the work out tonight all the hooked up tonight he s got a notice theory to take off his oversized championship ring which he s been sporting do not too so not a scholar position he you get your your books paid for they but not a scholarship position that surprised me four or five students that rotate around and take turns being brutus happy 50th birthday brillante dutton in the game now and he takes a hand up and we get another talented skilled player was he down the <person player="warren ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> comes out but a whistle <person player="mook reynolds" race="UNK" position="CB">reynolds</person> the fresh probably going to take a peek at that just to be sure it i thought the <person player="warren ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> may have popped out at the contact rage or his knee touch there was immediate recovery by the hokies urban <person player="charley meyer" race="UNK" position="WR">meyer</person> trying to play fast but he cant beat the replay official beamer is furious well the only thing was a fumble the players under further review i think urban was trying to beat three playing beamer lost his head said he was out in the field trying to make sure officials yeah out i dont know because he was so low they got confused the right a condi me the balls out and like you said there s immediate recovery from virginia tech because they blow the whistle and rule him down unless there is an immediate recovery by the defensive team cant review it cant fix it yeah but that s that s not even debatable that s why these players are taught to get on the <person player="warren ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> instantly so then if they do go over and take a look which they will and it s a fumble the defense will recover that will cover the football so they give brillante done the carries the former fivestar recruit a junior out of canton ohio is elliot s back up the game first touch and loses it iowa state the third turnover replay booth is just checking for the spot of the football we are virtually certain this will be ruled a fumble on a recovery but he detected as you can see where to put it you know the storyline not just what happens here as we take one more look not even close to being down going forward kirk this virginia tech team which obviously had counted on<person player="michael brewer" race="UNK" position="QB">michael brewer</person>there is no experienced backup for him furman at purdue at east carolina before they begin their acc slate four to five weeks with the initial humbled and recovered by the defense virginia tech s balls 41 yard line first now every couple of seconds they wouldnt have been able to replay after watching <person player="brenden motley" race="UNK" position="QB">motley</person> tonight and i know he s been around maybe theyre able with a week of practice may be able to build a better package for him where it s not a surprise but i dont know a lot about chris dirk and the freshman who s out of youngstown ohio but if he can throw the football with the skill that they have you might you might see dirk and get more involved and maybe get an opportunity because it with this offense theyve got to be able to throw it with the weapons they have on the outside to take some of the pressure off their run game playaction <person player="brenden motley" race="UNK" position="QB">motley</person> steps up delivers our throw in the sidelines but it s too wide for<person player="isaiah ford" race="UNK" position="WR">isaiah ford</person>and complete mr big six for 219 freshman redshirted last year he is at least familiar with the scheme and what they do thatll be thatll be for frank bieber and scotland and the offensive staff but that is as significant of loss as you could see with a weekend full of injuries well it s a typical situation to college football is what made ohio state s journey to a national title last year all the more remarkable to end up the year with a third quarterback plan superbly in the last three games <person player="brenden motley" race="UNK" position="QB">motley</person> again fires over the middle to<person player="sam rogers" race="UNK" position="FB">sam rogers</person>and the fullback makes the catch for a first down in size is 30 so this is insurmountable but perhaps <person player="brenden motley" race="UNK" position="QB">motley</person> can gain some confidence going forward and you can make some plays here and that s what you want to do frank beamer actually challenged the whole offense when they ran out on the field even though this game is out of reach it s for that very reason not just finishing strong but trying to build any anything that you can build on at all going in to the rest of the season <person player="raekwon mcmillan" race="UNK" position="LB">mcmillan</person> hammered down damon the web the backup corner was there i think urban <person player="charley meyer" race="UNK" position="WR">meyer</person> will be happy about along with <person player="luke morgan" race="UNK" position="QB">luke</person> pickle chris ash is barely able to build a lead in week one gives you a chance to get game snaps for that next unit and they may not seem like that big a deal but any any kind of game reps you can receive just helps you that next time you go out there and maybe it s in there through an injury maybe youre asked to play in the first or second quarter and a meeting meaningful snaps human again an ohio state which opens for the road game a true road game for the first time since 98 typically theyll open up against navy or a mac team the very tough opener in a hostile house but this team of the mature attitude the toll <person player="charley meyer" race="UNK" position="WR">meyer</person> dont worry about revenge and payback as mode as route were selfmotivated and obviously extremely talented ten of the top 150 raff prospects ago didnt todd mcshea ten on this team and one notable <person player="guy ferrelli" race="UNK" position="TE">guy</person> wasnt even here tonight in <person player="joey bosa" race="UNK" position="DL">bosa</person> <person player="raekwon mcmillan" race="UNK" position="LB">mcmillan</person> moved the chains again first down at the 18 or countdown to the debut svp on sportscenter the premiere of his new nightly program scores highlights spspin right after the game and this take on matt harvey dan <person player="patrick wise" race="UNK" position="RB">patrick</person> is the studio guests back in the mothership enjoy that tonight and first down he had been short games incredible to think that virginia tech had a 17 to 14 halftime lead in this game outscored 28 to nothing ohio state just pulling away and it was the big place it was<person player="braxton miller" race="UNK" position="WR">braxton miller</person>yeah sure was averaging over 10 yards of play tonight against the bud foster defense which is not an easy thing to do think back to where they were a year ago worst offensive game by far at home against virginia tech that scheme caused fits for them and what they tried to do <person player="brenden motley" race="UNK" position="QB">motley</person> escapes lofts it in the traffic in the end zone for a touchdown <person player="isiah prince" race="UNK" position="OL">isiah</person> <person player="isaiah ford" race="UNK" position="WR">ford</person> <person player="brenden motley" race="UNK" position="QB">motley</person> does a good job extending the play and makes his first career touchdown pass again you love to see the fight he loved to see <person player="brenden motley" race="UNK" position="QB">motley</person> here show and he can do good effort to get outside of<person player="chris worley" race="nonwhite" position="LB">chris worley</person>and break contain and once he gets outside of there now he s just buying time and trying to wait for one of his receivers to break free in the ohio state s the backup second there you see their eyes looking in the backfield watching him in losing the receiver who is able to work to an open area in behind them so perhaps something to build on for a virginia tech team that s gonna have to make do without<person player="michael brewer" race="UNK" position="QB">michael brewer</person>in the coming weeks well for the first time in the long history of the ap poll every single voter with ohio state at number one and the preseason no team had ever been anointed that way they did nothing tonight to make you feel theyre not number one and and certainly im eager to see your your top four one thing about top four with a committee watching is to me that it should be very fluid ohio state to me will end up being one one if the one week bam has got to be up there i would think it too you know after that there s a bunch of teams i happen to think ucla with their freshman quarterback josh rose and id put up their notre dame the way they played against texas at home i have no problem with them up there in the top four so those would be some with you have tcu of course baylor others there could be critters you drop tcu out did you have them outside for the minnesota game no i kind of start fresh i mean they asked you to do a preseason poll the team s you take will finish in the floor okay but to me i like to just watch the first week and then just start assessing what you actually see as opposed to reading for an entire three months now let s go by what you saw in the first week everybody s even who looked the best no matter who youre playing it s so tempting to draw conclusions so early in the season and often it just proven to be wrong it the ohio state lost at home was part of black saturday for the big 10 member michigan state lost big at oregon michigan illinois northern illinois beat northwestern michigan by the end of the year vick tended look too bad right people overreacted but what they saw in early september and obviously they went a championship michigan state wins a big six bowl game but i but i think you have to be willing to be fluid with the first three or four or five weeks based on on the results and what youre seeing and who s playing who now they tried a little trickier here for perhaps was an onside kick but ohio state sniffed it out and called a timeout he goes shame in the big ten is that there s been what can only be interpreted as a conscious effort to avoid having the strongest teams in the east division with the buckeyes michigan state penn state michigan and so on and the west division theyre very very few collisions between the top teams in the two divisions which makes four i think this is a fans point of view a diluted conference schedule sure theyll have to get past the winner of the west if they win their division in the championship game as they did last year in resounding fashion but boy it would be fun to see michigan state ohio state michigan play the teams across like nebraska wisconsin iowa northwestern which looked good in their opening game e it just it just isnt happening like you see in other conferences unfortunately and and i think you see er you know i think if you look into the future youll youll start to see that in the big ten but right now youre right wisconsin after playing the way they did saturday night against alabama you look at their schedule probably gonna be favored in almost every single game they play i mentioned the good year but you those rankings real shakeup as the okies go for little trickery on the onside kick but the bounce comes up right into the hands of ohio state they make the recovery inside their last two minutes that s<person player="joshua perry" race="UNK" position="LB">joshua perry</person>then starting linebacker the veteran on the hands team she got kirk he s everywhere found his way to ridge mountains getting his own bobble head to head he s got a brand okay you bet another <person

was playing northen eagles and falcons kickoff the monday night football doubleheader nfl countdown at five oclock tirico and gruden will be in atlanta then it s the vikings and the niners i mean sam youve enjoyed spending this monday night football with you to cap off holiday weekend im still giggling about the ohio state fans it is he s the mascot right oh they got him in there tim that does that scarlet and gray yes i think that s you just focus right there edition well the big question coming in who would it be jones or <person player="jt barrett" race="nonwhite" position="QB">barrett</person> was jones early played pretty well ran it a lot <person player="jt barrett" race="nonwhite" position="QB">barrett</person> off the bench here showed his skills with a long run on a touchdown pass and then their former quarterback<person player="braxton miller" race="UNK" position="WR">braxton miller</person>made two monster plays your assessment of number 12 tonight it s probably not the dominant performance hed hope to have but i think he made some good decisions he struggled there in the second quarter but then he started to find some matchups he s over to come up with big plays he hit <person player="curtis samuel" race="UNK" position="RB">samuel</person> found<person player="braxton miller" race="UNK" position="WR">braxton miller</person>and it found his own way to be able to get into the endzone for a touchdown but it s a starting point for him the talking about here<person player="jt barrett" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jt barrett</person>how s it going to go all that now is behind not just him but also<person player="jt barrett" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jt barrett</person>now he could just focus on he s the quarterback he s the <person player="guy ferrelli" race="UNK" position="TE">guy</person> theyre gonna go with for now and just continue to be the leader that he can be the best leader he can be for the team <person player="warren ball" race="UNK" position="RB">ball</person> on the game and he spins for a gain and thatll add to their offensive total before that snap of 567 yards i think the other thing youll see is is the season goes on youll get back to seeing that when the receivers all come back <person player="jt barrett" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jt</person> your pardon zeke <person player="ezekiel elliott" race="nonwhite" position="RB">elliott</person> a much much bigger part of the offense to compliment the vertical passing game of<person player="cardale jones" race="nonwhite" position="QB">cardale jones</person>i think youll see that grow as the year goes on so the hokies went to columbus and spoiled the buckeyes home up to a year ago ohio state roles in the blacksburg
