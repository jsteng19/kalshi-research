texas quarterback hopeful well brent what a story quote before i grew up in small town in texas high school coach his father was a high school coach he s really waited for this opportunity his whole life and now it s here he s going up against the number one team in the country here s all the physical abilities the quick army manages the office weve never been in this atmosphere how we handle this kind of crowd and this kind of hype very very important for section two get him the ball early and get him to relax to just make a good throw to get his top and it s going if im a year ago it was the buckeyes defense with the stars this year it s the offense well brent it s obvious to be wise at ohio state offense is getting so much attention it s because they have so much talent i think they have to legitimate heisman trophy candidates on offense i also think fort smith is the most improved quarterback in college circle he can make all the throws techeuns always been a dynamic return man he s ollie dynamic receiver this texas office is for real absolutely and i think you can both agree the matchup of the quarterbacks is critical and when you think of it which one tonight will

the field even though they are second behind ohio state folks they are the favorites because theyre playing at home though texas and the ohio state buckeyes are coming up next on abc this espn production is available on abc hd presented by dish network well texas without a couple of players tonight because mack brown suspended starting corner terrell brown and backup linebacker terrell <person player="tyrell gatewood" race="UNK" position="DB">gatewood</person> after their arrest on misdemeanor marijuana and gun charges earlier of the week that drug charges against both were dropped yesterday because former linebacker aaron harris who was driving the car took responsibility the attorney for brown says he expects the gun charges to be dropped early next week lisa south is the fourth member of our team has more on the story lisa well rinse her off rounds attorney let me speak for a minute yesterday and the first thing if darrell <person player="michael graham" race="UNK" position="LB">graham</person> said to me was i want to apologize my something to all the long run fans he said i feel like i let everyone down brown said i never meant to be a distraction for the team on the bus person he says i always tried to do the right thing and right now i have spent one class like a man learn from my mistakes and says i completely understand coach brown precision still brown said it s goner her he said i trained for this one game the entire summer he said it s going to be painful to have to watch it from home <person player="frank okam" race="UNK" position="DL">frank</person> <person player="tj wright" race="UNK" position="DB">wright</person> leaves in background ap announcement to the team earlier in the week jim russell of course will probe at the replacement at that corner spot and see what he s got texas won the toss they have deferred so the buckeyes will start on offense in the allpurpose picker protection will not put it<person player="greg johnson" race="UNK" position="P">greg johnson</person>who transferred here from 10th ago and the electrifying hit kid is back inside the 5yard line we will see early what the kickoff strategy will be for the long under way and a proving kick out of the endzone so here comes torrey smith bob davie and let s hit the folks at home watch tonight with number 10 the brent i think an improved quarterback i think early in his career he trusted his lake more than he trusted his arm i think the biggest improvement youll see is he now stands in that pocket and looks to throw first this guy can make all the throws antonio <person player="billy pittman" race="UNK" position="WR">pittman</person> the big set money back they put a phobic blocker stand <person player="jayson white" race="UNK" position="RB">white</person> in front of him and from that formation <person player="jayson white" race="UNK" position="RB">white</person> leads away city lineup so for toys who spits you recognized the name of the skill guys symbol of alignment but nope duck deadish the senior from warren he would be the left tackle last year he s now moved to center it means that alex boone only a sophomore on the left side very impressive in that offensive line here for the buck i see a lot of movement here early in this game by ohio state s offense but guys focus to the texas is too good they just line up in play they have to have move at the flow down texas definite seven take two handoffs that first pass is complete for the first down of running his faith in him and he can go 40 45 and out of bounds they bought him in space and as we take a look at that baby that is the key for the buckeye the first thing youre going to notice choice smith rolling to his left take in on the little improv flintlock and when you hear the guys with worldclass speed that much open space you see what happens the accuracy the throw there by troy smith enabling ted again to make the catch in stride and utilize his speed to pick up a big game for ohio state at 46 birth right off the bathroom buckeyes lucky buckeyes offense is matched against the technique defense so if you will freak against flint because of the quarterback position is down his pen if they back out have time fires over the middle incomplete just a touch shorter and he might have had brian hartline for six we check now that texas defense and of course of lisa filled you in on the details of the key storage veterans upfront and brian firmer number 29 and you will be working in there they will substitute<person player="brandon foster" race="UNK" position="DB">brandon foster</person>in there along with commerce so in effect youre going to have both of them trying to replace terrell brown here tonight second and ten hitmen on fine cut and it was daylight there bob baby for the first down and youre going to watch an tonio <person player="billy pittman" race="UNK" position="WR">pittman</person> this is a great cutback run he shows great vision hit the ultimate block by luring nichols that big tight end and when i asked joe dan was their offensive quarterback coach give me one word on antoniou fitment he said top toughness the power to be able to get in there and the also great patient and coaches he said nice cutback there to see the open hole in the backside air early loss goes over with again off the poisons left but they run that opportunity or quick <person player="billy pittman" race="UNK" position="WR">pittman</person> and put the powers just short of the 15yard line let s talk about the impact players for our ohio state it s pretty obvious weve already seen number 10 weve already seen number 25 and weve seen number 20 number seven that s a great graphic right there because those are your bad guys a lot of options play action couple passes off the option to pass in the shotgun that time of pitch and a big game interesting the way theyre trying to attack from the option here early and using the full back again van <person player="jayson white" race="UNK" position="RB">white</person> and going to pick to find to another hole on the right side but he is snag and brought down roderick muckelroy a backup linebacker number 38 the redshirt freshman whom theyre very impressed with cartman they feel that they have the defensive speed to be able to win the battle up front at the line of scrimmage and attack downhill that s what s so surprising about this first drive y ou se mixing up their formation mixing up their play calling very very valid beeping gene chizik cephas on their heels here early in the game and about 50 folks right now like number 10 one without football on 34 and hit them is out now they include the least well his hit by the receiver captions and he is down and he is covered up by the middle linebacker who was fine <person player="rashad bobino" race="UNK" position="LB">rashad</person> babineaux is a weak side linebacker a year ago and 44 deacon and i on number 10 and it s field goal time for the buckeye and gene chizik texas defensive coordinator log speed over such that a tremendous job i was shocked baba know buying on forklift aaron peppery a trick question to the 29 yard waste no <person player="lamarr houston" race="UNK" position="DL">houston</person> it s 48yarder and no good so the drive peters eyes wide left and now texas will have their first step back so when you come back youll see the freshman quarterback from tuscola texas youre watching espn college football on abc he s 63 or his 205 pounds hurt<person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt mccoy</person>his second start he is a gym rat he <person player="selvin young" race="UNK" position="RB">young</person> man who s worked very very hard for this opportunity as a freshman thought about it dreamed about it he s about to take his first snap in a big game the quarterback of texas that familiar shotgun bench <person player="selvin young" race="UNK" position="RB">young</person> heroes an undefeated season our first im starvin yarn little more that a year ago when he came back from major knee surgery and you can see on the first carry of the game hope mccoy from scola texas now has about 700 one stoplight downtown mr comey it s always like you have a game quarterback like this it s so important for him to get rid of the butterflies a lot of times it s a quick little quote get the completion away and then start to manage the offense without that hummer here just pick up the rhythm mccoy keeps it and malcolm jenkins the corner makes the stop for the buckeyes and our city offensive line support you can see you recognize some of the names we seem selvan lima swede at the winning venture poison but justin blaylock at some point opportunity to go to the nfl to come back for his senior season and coach is very happy to have the big rush over there those who thought and it s going to be incomplete without a onehopper those a baseball player making the pitch cartography and he took off in his old sport there was legal in our buckeye defense here fine fine front for but the rest of them theyve got to replace and laurinaitis started in the middle because the carpenters in korea the best of all youll have to anchor the line back were down a seven for hope effective quarterback both report to the point of order batted away beautifully by james laurinaitis the linebacker we told you about making a big defensive play here for the by first you going to see if fernand olson the outside linebacker / defense event gets great pressure<person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt mccoy</person>steps up and the texas fans wanted pass interference on number of 33 james laurinaitis the linebacker divisions get it very obvious that ohio state s moving around quite a bit before the snap hoping to confuse the <person player="selvin young" race="UNK" position="RB">young</person> quarterback to try to get him to put the ball in the cover here comes james and saw number 7 i cant wait to see that they do with this point <person player="greg johnson" race="UNK" position="P">johnson</person> hangs it high in wrists back on the 14 and these at the 10yard<person player="michael griffin" race="nonwhite" position="DB">michael griffin</person>the twin brother of <person player="marcus griffin" race="UNK" position="DB">marcus</person> who has worked his way into the starting lineup coming down on piston that makes the stop we come back well see the stars who are shining for the buckeye again and troy smith saturday night football on abc presented by southwest airlines the low fare from here to there it s on southwest airlines at southwestcom lincoln reach higher and ibm what makes you special a beautiful capital building here in austin the great state of texas about david you were a texas aggie defensive coordinator i know youve got some good thoughts and right after this first play by the buckeyes i want to ask you what the crowd in austin on a play fake this rolls out the right there s gonzales and thatll be a first and ten now it to sell out it s jampacked it was so noisy as long as youre over this to disrupt the of them the presence is one of my favorite places to play all across the mayor because it s a great environment the crowd noise he is not a state factor you notice all that black behind you in line right there you really that s room but be voted blazed on there it s what it allows the crowd worthless state this state is that i dont think it s much of a factor in the house is often defined i know you can feel it if he goes upset because everything was gone and there she wanted calpers yellow stuff first down and then and for a pic pic attacking me this time for the 30 l33 watch choice conversely virtually brothers from the cleveland area talk about the hydration of policeman s i know you live in columbus right he s become a very confident leader of the force in last year and a half i think what happened really is the coaches halfway through last season began to become confident in his abilities they trusted him more and now he is trusting his own decisionmaking so he comes into that that s there with this crowd on the road very similar the way bitch joe came into columbus last year as confident leaders who believe that his kenzaburo before necklace and and in a whole by marquez hardhitting safety and let s go to john hunters in new york the were down and she s lovin pick up the children here gene chizik the defensive coordinator of texas 49 great pictures within the corrugator fairhope seniors with a new defeated oven prior to coming to texas last year superseded national championship and right now gonzales is giving him heartburn about davey s number 11 is that mean im a bigtime receiver here and ill tell you what is there any question about troy smith arm strength or when he goes to gonzales a anytime you get a safety number 27<person player="michael griffin" race="nonwhite" position="DB">michael griffin</person>is a heck of a football player but they get the safety isolated on anthony gonzales but the arm strength and a great third down conversion right there interesting to see that time teddy can used as a decoy to clear out their inlaws and vacate a wide open zone welldesigned play by ohio state you can paint into the decoy to pick up that first time the freshman phenom crisper ohio prepare by here is chris the number one rated running back coming out of high school baseball and roderick muckelroy is getting a lot of action over there and the will linebacker over texas they expect the bucks to come running at them and he s a little bit stouter than <person player="drew kelson" race="UNK" position="DB">drew</person> nelson who came to that position from safety and one thing you know that ohio state the ability to mix the spread off and he as kirk mentioned earlier with the power offense texas an undersized he first defense the ability to line up in our backs and wellness for ohio state buckeyes broke down and missed a field goal their openings are but they are whether has to throw it away the texas bench is screaming before grounding by that believe you got it past the line of scrimmage there will be no call on that brian robeson number 39 was a client pleasure now there is a flag that goes come down the number 10 often fill in the pocket no receiver in the area we foul walked down her down and the point their choice with with inside the tackle box still in the pocket that s why i was called intentional grounding yeah exactly coaching bill lemonnier mind referee for the big ten they got this right rick nelson is his umpire keep in mind you can throw the football away if you are outside the tackle box excellent call wide get by the officiating through the collected as a result it will be third down and 14 would pit them back at running back and the him out as an added receiver which stayed with it as long as he could and then they form all over it it exactly original line of scrimmage<person player="marcus griffin" race="UNK" position="DB">marcus griffin</person>and pavano are there again and the buckeyes will be forced to punt and it will be one of their veterans age eight upon so who was their punter a year

you remember in the michigan game and then also the fiesta bowl against notre dame is become a leader this year today that get down at any level as the horns mounted draw back to the 25yard line the veteran from history seniors elvin <person player="selvin young" race="UNK" position="RB">young</person> yards and they ripping huge holes now at at defense and theyre doing it with just a couple of hundreds along the way a little countering the thief justin boy rocket 340 powers fooling around when she mentioned kelvin <person player="selvin young" race="UNK" position="RB">young</person> has dropped 15 pounds since the rose bowl he does look quicker to make all the sudden check this offensive line the quick tempo theyre starting to control the line of scrimmage sullivan came out and then with that in and sottero and back off to the side on and on first down and put it again in to sell the <person player="selvin young" race="UNK" position="RB">young</person> hands you know why hed play

position="RB">young</person> being healthy for seven <person player="selvin young" race="UNK" position="RB">young</person> he has waited to become the leader with being a roommate of dividends here it s his turn he s taken advantage other right now second down and 7 victoria and the horns mounting to drive both incomplete and appearances paul reid the intended receiver malcolm chicken clumsy one of the questions pass interference defense number five 15yard penalty and he met number two of course jenkins you can watch and here s what happened when you dont play the fall as a defensive back and saw malcolm jenkins just try to play through on with sweet other than obvious thought i was very saying one of the big questions about the buckeyes the defensive backfield from all <person player="jamaal charles" race="nonwhite" position="RB">charles</person> number 25 he s now the running back the officials are going to respawn the ball right now let s see where they finally put it down i think they put it down at about the 7 yard line you know the nerves would be talked about to the <person player="selvin young" race="UNK" position="RB">young</person> quarterback even forget settled into this position he s in her comfort zone which is what <person player="greg johnson" race="UNK" position="P">greg</person> david calling to do an alder some he s worried about executing game plan how about touches most other basically on this whole rabbit the rare short question quarterback in trouble off the press tucked away coming fires in zone incomplete he eluded the corner voice but there was enormous pressure in the buckeyes did a fine job of also defending the receiver in the corner well the first thing you see the athletic ability right now is malcolm jenkins missus<person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt mccoy</person>and then the athletic effort by <person player="limas sweed" race="nonwhite" position="WR">limas</person> lead right here some couples of filamentous one here gets but it doesnt count only the out of bounds to drop it second down and goal that s analysis complete so to the end zone gumbo picked up on the run now by washington bothell washington coming down the far sideline look better bounds on the is and big number 33 james laurinaitis in the middle of it against<person player="billy pittman" race="UNK" position="WR">billy pittman</person>when you talk about things that we football games maybe win national championships i want you to watch this effort by james laurinaitis right there just rip the football off those things when these kind of games maybe win national championship and<person player="billy pittman" race="UNK" position="WR">billy pittman</person>theyre fighting to get extra yard had to pull out for trying to stretch it out and a big impact there by lera 9 is jordan <person player="aaron lewis" race="UNK" position="DL">lewis</person> before his knee touch big for over and a big sequence of events here in pro io state and now he gets again involved in some kind of work force or something right now paper going to this moment where i say my we throw the money back time out on the field coaches challenge so this is the earliest challenge that we have heard of and mack brown telling us that you would take the challenge to the fourth quarter i am i am almost stunned by this ive had a conversation with mack he knows it s already been reviewed up in the food there was time to see it did you see anything bob does he have a point here brent im as surprised as you are because no he doesnt have a point that ball is clearly stripped out and we were sitting on the couch yesterday with background look their conversations they aim up he said he is going to save his timeouts because the point is theyre being reviewed anyhow exactly the crossbar and that we had a perfect angle he enoug texas fans they can sneak a peek up here and say mack turn it over to i because the coaches have told us ago years using that challenge were going to need it late and this is pretty obvious isnt it that laurinaitis has got the ball out put the ball down and when a coach and he might fit on a couch to talk about im going to save it for the fourth quarter protected such a big point in his football game that he felt maybe the pitman and said way will you down maybe a big point right now but i guarantee you theyre better off guarantee that s how football operates 1st down and 10 at midfield it s already been confirmed by replay so there s nothing they can do and theyve told the texas sideline somebody has made a mistake doubt i simply you would not do that in that situation and they do look at back then he s a timeout here he is unhappy a keen of the assistant coach and texas loses a timeout on top of it remember allah purchase talent so one versus two texans at ohio state the passions are running high focus about coach maybe at an interesting point here big turn of event again if you get betty get isolated one on one battlefield right here and here s our one on one on aaron harris bed takes the dough steep noggin gang palace pets at the 25 what a para hand is being honest against the michigan wolverines who rose up and made that huge head as ohio state came back to win that game in ann arbor a very underrated receiver because all we do is talk about number seven and anthony gonzales come all the way across the football field again mantoman coverage kirk<person player="michael griffin" race="nonwhite" position="DB">michael griffin</person>he s not going to match up we have any big daughter that s what makes the ohio state attack so very bad career for these people could humana the safety on any device that supports missus kitchen that he throws the job design they go into the fold the offensive line between xx on live at heineken mankato it was not a perfect flow well then that s maurice remember the sophomore from jacksonville florida but i thought for the naked eye that the emphasis lived i think that s why maurice is a running event and not a wide receiver he comes down and just runs the curl route again a great window to throw the football through right there towards that your guys exactly right that football should have been done good to be gone we went to the empty fit they flex the tail back down that s one in reef wells knows youve got to make that ten second time that a holiday there s not a serious bra you figure theyve kinda where the sun bowl of movement the offensive line this is going to cost them a big five yards and kirk i want to go back on a point on that first drive that failed with the missed field goal you said all the time russell i think someone else might not have here s a really really like second now he does not have the security blanket and one of the things that he was concerned about coming on the road was the conditioning factor in the heat and brent we talked about this before the game but one thing is for sure is the depth and the depth of their offensive line theyre playing the entire second unit of the offensive line and if they dont have a chance to sword not having my vision of jeff you can as a major concern for them after this entire syllabus the second unit right now boom there s hit a good cloud if you have said oh he every 15 degrees $59 again what a combo a first down and how about the strength of this arm on this throw there are some scouts are going to take note when he rifles this one to the sidelines in books he s undersized for some people but he s a goodlooking porter back and <person player="brett sykes" race="UNK" position="DL">brett</person> do you remember our conversation with gene chizik the defensive coordinator yesterday he said they are going to know on every snap where number 7 pick in it they better right now <person player="shane yates" race="UNK" position="DL">shane</person> s got family that can find out what as if they are gone the formation and which was eaten up by that defensive front that was directly lowkey the defensive tackle hoseman because i think that all the talk this week about terrell brown not seeing in

were to accidentally lose that game he would go from be the hero to right back to being on the hot seat zero bobby would be a little too black for us but we did the full monty no truck that could be a big addition third down and three incomplete it s amazing here early in this game for ohio state rotating numerous players in and out jim tressel told me this week that his goal in the first half with the play 57 guy 57 players and weve seen the offensive line the entire group rotating that time the entire second unit the defense was lined up they want to try to survive the first half by rotating players in and then go back to the starters in the second half theyre really concerned about the heat the humidity down in austin where <person player="greg johnson" race="UNK"

a lot more pressure and mixing up the look just trying to hit troy smith offbalance a little bit and get his receivers and troy to the point where they dont have quite the rhythm that they had there in the first quarter professor funding the lawsuit oh it s got cigarette honey 22 yard line and let s check in now with matt winer on a in game sportscenter before matt my friend lotus tate has stormed back to take the lead against troy after an interception joe surratt the fullback from four yards out seminoles still only have 48 yards rushing in this game but they do lead troy by a touchdown inside to me ill tell you what fear of embarrassment sometimes is the greatest motivator and i think that s the seminoles right there troy might have gotten a little nervous day think about what theyre about to do got a wonder bucket on southerner woodcote deployed way to play today past three members found marcoon tonight s area of coverage brought to you by outback steakhouse look down on sold out seen here texas memorial stadium theyre going to enlarge it even more bottom part there theyre going to tear it all out at the end of this season close it in that s more fickle luxury

race="nonwhite" position="RB">charles</person> in there at the money bag let me ask you this to you what was your record is a defensive coordinator against the home now i know you know what it is someone let you say because i dont want to say it that nine and one us believe were wrong uh nora correct rejection was in and one really i just get excited i was wondering when youre going to get to them i get you to do that with color yall respond through a scuffle i would get it on earlier me that record you want me to open the night with noise tigers their dad eric loki in for sauvignon there s the defensive tackle for the first time as the road grader run off his clock and get the 30ton some whoever got in to see number 96 he s has started air he s coming back off the field you can ease the road grader in the short yardage situations he was a high school fullback and he just loved it he said one day the coke cook brown he goes just hand me the ball and he says you better pick up a fumble of your own the football their version of the fridge he didnt pick up a big block there by texas they pick up a first down and now you start to wonder can they get selvan <person player="selvin young" race="UNK" position="RB">young</person> and<person player="jamaal charles" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jamaal charles</person>back involved in the offense and going here the alamos if quote report control the ball down the field it doesnt make it strong to fall more than five miles almost there s a youngling on the sideline who can throw it down the field jevons disease this time he goes down and complete these saying keep your mistress eat over there preside high as you get to the velvet that s bob david called for in that time they protected all for the playaction but what i like to face the ball is thrown up in the air and it s a great job of adjusting back to the rough back to the football by selves and <person player="selvin young" race="UNK" position="RB">young</person> the ball is underthrown with sheldon <person player="selvin young" race="UNK" position="RB">young</person> and the running back running a wheel route right down the sideline recognized the ball was underthrown came back against ohio state top cover for malcolm jenkins i made a nice play all right then after the 29 yard game and the horns have been planted this game that a person go through 17 turned it over to a new play and we would live a life with the timing of the pass downfield was perfect to try to just mix it up and slow down the pressure from ohio state defense ohio state has an aggressive defense their whole plan tonight would to try to get into a head of polka coy making his first start a big big a game he wanted to try to infuse it see if they could rattle in with a variety of looks and any time he can get a big completion like that to slow him down i could help them run the football game becca dance people round the studio dodgers go to the first down stop by laurinaitis related game defensively by the buckeyes the 33 forced the turnover inside the 5yard line you just joined this texas what needed it was first and goal that a passing apparent ball against ohio state or on is punched it out and donald washington we turned it down the sidelines and is only reported that i would say quarterback draw right now but that s not this <person player="selvin young" race="UNK" position="RB">young</person> instead of is seven <person player="selvin young" race="UNK" position="RB">young</person> there reaches out and let s check in with lisa toll bridge there s some folks here tonight change the cold war s a hero no matter what he does to tonight the mccoys were at their lakeland home in <person player="michael graham" race="UNK" position="LB">graham</person> texas on memorial day when they heard screams across the lake and it was pitch black outside so folks bad hops into the batter and lambda3 land resources given time that s where they found to commit everything and her husband kim who was having a seizure another neighbor already called nine one one four four and a quarter mile up the hill to let paramedics know where to go the harringtons are here tonight ken is going to find fatima says that hopefully save her husband s life i asked about it he said i didnt do anything that anyone else would have done right real american no storage wonderful story and people so nice to see ken over there and learned it quarterback number and believe you with the school right here the texans did very the first to jump off convince <person player="selvin young" race="UNK" position="RB">young</person> vampires he told the boys his alltime favorite texas quarterback and understandably so nice to see the hype sir second down and 11 you look in that helmet at<person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt mccoy</person>he looks like you about twelve to sixteen years old doesnt it pops over on the sideline hit on the release got it off in time complete for a big time throw under duress by linus weed great concentration by this quarterback there because oh boy i dont know if he realized that curtis terry was coming from him flying tried but he hurried just enough to get the ball off and his going to a position where <person player="limas sweed" race="nonwhite" position="WR">limas</person> lead had a great body position on the corner great throw and a great job of blocking out that pass rush coming towards them and no one liked that well any more than the harrington face down has been and rebecca the <person player="selvin young" race="UNK" position="RB">young</person> running back and jumped in the middle of there from all charlie hit by david patterson on the fine defensive heckler those two defensive tackles depending on how they do this year quintet dr david pat it s a dead play sunday football but the pros are looking to see if they if they like to save did it bucket on every play doh not many people would have thought when i was eight with nine new starters on defense will be pitching the shutout right now with three minutes left in his post at laurinaitis he is heated at the 33 kelvin who fat or money back off to the quarterback troy i found bigger than the other id and remember the last time that the horns marched in the red john curb this happened they had opportunity early in their football game to<person player="billy pittman" race="UNK" position="WR">billy pittman</person>making an effort trying to gain the ball to try to pick up a first down in game clara knight has charred the ball wound to the pivot donald washington picked it up and with the other way got a turning point in this game let s say this time if texas can capitalize now on third down and get inside the 10 yard line third and six for the horns at some point rhombic lead at six foot five up here at the top of the screen half into the hit it in on the relief incomplete and mccoy at penalty flag on his hip it s backed by the quarterback against ohio state automatic first down j richardson on a little stunt coming into the inside flips through i think it might have been helmettohelmet that time with j richardson getting copla koi la definitely relates it to be helmet the helmet if anything i dont free that i didnt see any helmet the helmet i didnt see him leading with the helmet are using the helmet as a weapon it definitely was on a late hit roughing the court of it and as you know these are not reviewable but let s take a close look at this again that s i dont see how you call them in the question will call in at some point he has whole pack on right it is contact on the corner everything like the token youre right did you made a good point you have to lower your head and make contact with a broken players had to be able to handle called again feel worse than going at first understood so he s running back 25 going in the endzone that would be hopeless when we talked about him going up in his state but think about the shoes that he s trying to fill vince <person player="selvin young" race="UNK" position="RB">young</person> one of the best quarterbacks to ever play not only protect this maybe in college football and it his first big step in a number two team defending national champions inside the number one team in the country <person player="greg johnson" race="UNK" position="P">greg</person> davis toler s that and they came out the spring these two quarterback devon s needed he was dead even and they came back in the fall and three points three it was mccoy s job that s not familiar he was gripped the office being a coach s son helped him tremendously understand the offense they pop it right back sigh girls got it touchdown texas on the toy miss <person player="billy pittman" race="UNK" position="WR">billy</person> penn and there are angled honore a13 play drive richard coke mccoy and remember the look during this drum play drive here very very important for texas before we get to halftime to get some momentum created and how about the equipment made the fumble with the other end of the field comes back and has a touchdown opportunity for the longhorns it goes back to one thing as prize it to the x the fourth let us not forget that personal foul penalty was a helmet the helmet is that why the referee folded and gave them a first down and the horns take advantage of it and there s colts biggest fans the harrington family what a great moment im matt winer back in new york here s our vote for the pontiac gamechanging performance of the day florida state struggling with troy but geno haynes with a big pick there no fear potti a gamechanging performance just log on to espncom keywords tanya jamaica cotton fine clothes defensive portator working his troops over there on the sidelines after they came on the field his talk laurie and the horns drivin to tie this just inside of commence exactly they kick it away coming picked up by got thomas and he is down short of the 35 yard line with 1:45 left on it you know we go back to that penalty and we think about it it is an automatic penalty on helmet helmet i want you to to watch this carefully and tell me if it s helmet to help i say yes i think if helmet the helmet by the technicality of the rules but if im coaching right now j richardson promo what else i tell them to do here the people below how you how would you folk that i wasnt going to do anything differently i will we know what you think first i am 10 for troy smith and the pressure passes away beautifully and steps out of bounds at the 37yard on the bottom line is texas handy opportunity after they caught the break and they capitalize hopeful coy coming of age right in front of our eyes 4 for 4 on that 13 play drive giving texas a very very important touchdown here into the crowd back into the game and again his confidence top feeling a defective could do some things on offense with him throwing the football very much in good charge boys perfect to this day sets up against the pleasure fires to the middle and to the 40yard line and it brian will biscay his second ketchup than i did <person player="selvin young" race="UNK" position="RB">young</person> way there s a penalty flag for home another big blow against the buckeyes if im gene chizik and of trying to stock jim tressel holding 75 off a 10yard penalty still second down there good alex boone theyre going to have to make some adjustments at halftime because it s become very obvious ohio state trying to attack not not necessarily with teddy ginn against aaron rodgers still taking their shot there but it s not only in finnegan palace at brian hartline it s brian risky theyre going to the second third important resurgence with matchups to their advantage against safeties going to get into younger corners there is the statistic of the first half ladies and gentlemen five penalties against the i none against the law look at that paper over set it down and 17 race please doc dollars to the forty and that is about four yards revelation ohio state with all three timeouts remaining little surprise they dont use a timeout right now just settle down on a cheaper oil deck person could do that by countries plus to their coverage to give them a shot here third down and again gives him a first down working against law very very dangerous to leave a corner even if talented his air laws by himself when a high estate office is in hurry up because the teddy ginn were able to flip just one tackle he s going 50 yards for touchdown timeout has been called so the buckeyes buckeyes use a use a timeout so we look at this game and uh and how it has unfolded and a very lowscoring first half weve got 28 seconds remaining a touchdown a piece of the horns were turned away kirk and bob early by that tumble when lauren i just punched it out but but what youre feeling here about why i think what happens here for ohio state is very very important for both sides other objectives james momentum by finally being able to sustain a drive and put it into the end zone you try the game it got the stadium alive i got the crowd involved magic it created some confidence here protected that they needed or they got to have done but theyve got a stop ohio state here yeah and i look at it s a seven seven game that there s been a lot more plays a lot more entertaining than which you think a seven seven football game with gideon s gun tell you what guys we got a bigtime game here tonight now oh really i like it i like it that is true youre gonna werent you saying well you say so what i would you stay here i somebody signal orlov whore seizures i stumbled it my wife is very sick $500 grabs another one across the 30 yard i grab my dumb little lemon and if i guys hurry up 22 seconds on that 23 art game ohio state once again nice little decoy disguising by anthony gonzales ohio state feels that penny didnt get all the attention but their best most complete receiver is anthony gonzales he found a nice seam in the zone ive got to ask you what coverage was that i mean texas has had some gaping holes in that secondary i think i think theyre confused he planned three or four plays there s been a lot of confusions you can see the communication with texas and their defensive backfield where theyre trying to get on the same page i would say mixing up formations mixing up personnel i think that s this time confusing this defense but anthony gonzales has been all over the field he s been able to take advantage of the youth in the tech and index the secondary terrell brown of course is out of this game and it s been up to<person player="brandon foster" race="UNK" position="DB">brandon foster</person>and<person player="ryan palmer" race="UNK" position="DB">ryan palmer</person>and even the safeties here they thought not been able to stay up with number 11 and i dont think there s any question troy smith go to receiver his number 11 anthony gonzales that is his safety net like there it was last year santonio holmes teddy ginn gets a lot of the attention because of his speed and even great receiver it s a nice compliment to have for the other side two seconds our guys have one timeout defense looks like number 21 run three kids one who in this town back in and he beat <person player="aaron ross" race="UNK" position="DB">ross</person> we came over to the wall through coach myself and you and we had a chance with lisa to talk for the ohio state players one of the things that choice myth told me was he has a lot more freedom at the line of scrimmage to make them check anybody sees teddy ginn in men s game one on one he has the flexibility to turn it loose and he made a check there at the line of scrimmage because he thought teddy oneonone in his era and went right by him for the touchdown perfect throw by troy smith and that s great nails there extra point the thing youre going to notice right here ohio state puts three receivers into the boundary they leave click into the life out in the field you can clearly defined in coverage for troy smith and yes great for you mantoman popping up and the mistake right there that the corner<person player="aaron ross" race="UNK" position="DB">aaron ross</person>made kirk he looked back to the ball with teddy ginn out ahead oh and that s a nono and the speed we keep bragging about in finnegan violence they keep bragging about how good a player he is on the other side of upset again it s because teddy ginn is so explosive that it takes the attention away from anthony gonzalez but we talked him talk about him go through guys at the end of the day it s the speed in the backyard ball between troy smith and said again you know kirk i want to go back to something that the doc david said earlier that troy smith is a legitimate heisman trophy candidate and he can really step up living it yeah be this stage built that foundation even stronger doesnt i was wondering to mention that h word because i see the same thing you do you had him in the fiesta bowl again grady wing and the winner of that game became the runner coming into this year the masochist candidates going to poppy okay hold on now caitlyn it went off without a passing game so you cant eliminate running above him he might be the most out of player ecological and i dont know if your mother i dont think im going to get enough yard push your words really close on when i do we talked about a swing of momentum texas looked like they had a chance to tie it come up with a stop get the halftime seven and seven ohio state comes right back put six points on the board and now theyre going to hit the showers with the set to sevenpoint lead and the momentum you talked about troy smith a lot of people ask why the coaches give guys stuck in chances i think this is why there s no question jim tressel has given him two or three opportunities he had some off field problems early in this career this guy s already graduated from ohio state two days later that s why you give guys second chances in your football program end of the first half ohio state with that late touchdown pass to kick in from his dear friend <person player="cory michner" race="UNK" position="DL">cory</person> smith puts him up and again hook it out let s go to lisa thanks <person player="frank okam" race="UNK" position="DL">frank</person> so what went right on that last ride they thought they were going into halftime find out what went right on that last buckle you know our kids practice a lot those twominute drills and boy made a lot of plays pass protection was good and we got single coverage for teddy and whenever we get single coverage for teddy we have a good chance that penalty play that that kept their touchdown drive alive the official explained it to you what did you tell you he said he s protecting the quarterback which i understand good luck the second half rory smith throws for 219 yards and two touchdowns right now let s go to john saunders craig james and doug flutie in new york take it away john i wonder what brent would give you the excel he called that he really started it look but ill give you credit you made the call on a pregame show today saying that gonzalez would have a big game as well as get imbalance coverages the safety is going going to be helping on ted ginn side gods allah says the guy s going to be 101 most today but like we saw at the end again oneonone coverage big play guy it was interesting to see in the course of the game how ohio state started getting blitzed there texas defenses blitzing and then got him out of sync got troy smith out of sync and he adjusted as it went on they got into minutes roll made plays against the blitz speaking of adjusting the whole pregame all week leading up to this game we beth asked the question<person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt mccoy</person>will he be able to handle this will<person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt mccoy</person>i think has answered everybody s questions about that he s a smooth poised <person player="selvin young" race="UNK" position="RB">young</person> man he has a lot of confidence going to halftime so i really believe coming out in the second half texas s defense has to match what<person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt mccoy</person>is done with his offensive unit weve seen ohio state s defense and they played better than everybody thought they could alright stick around when we return well come back with some highlights we will not want to miss florida they in troy a struggle youre watching espn college football on abc this is espn on abc john saunders craig james and doug flutie for you here were at halftime and ted ginn jr has been the difference maker in this one 14:07 ohio state has the lead in that contest now you had to wonder about florida state miami today they played on monday night of course florida state wins a very very tough defense and binding battle they have to come back now there s five days later and faced roy so theyre thinking we can roll out of bed and win this game it was a trojan horse it did more damage here buhbuhbuh here deflected and caught by gary banks with a 10/10 game weatherford goes 16 yards of chris davis to tie this game at 17 with six minutes to go in the fourth quarter they finally tie the game up and then the big fullback totally carried in for the touchdown and to really subjective question time here s a miami offense that on monday night went against the florida state defense it was unbelievable they had 134 yards today in this ballgame before he comes out and their offense has 284 yards against florida state statements i thought florida state s defense was unbelievable but doug as players you and i both know parodies close in college football and men it s hard to get that tank filled up again that short it s an emotional win for you youre patting yourself on the back for a couple of days saying oh we beat miami and all sentence ill shoot it s game day that s right and if if troy doesnt throw two interceptions in the last five minutes of the game florida state doesnt win unbelievable would have been one of the biggest upsets in college football history all right penn state facing notre dame today were not sure about the irish because the last week against georgia tech they were in a struggle while were sure of them now brady quinn had three touchdown passes there s 106th and deep in the pocket and possibly across the middle the defense did a great job is well and contest you soon to see the sack here and then joo bukowski picks it up in those 25 yards and anthony morelli theyre making a mistake but it really was it came down to brady quinn again on offense making a lot of plays from penn state and it s georgia and south carolina yves berger had no problems against georgia when he coached in florida danny where though it takes you 10 from 10 yards out then mike davis could tackle it in the end zone for a safety and theyve got good to that lat he couldnt have my defensive lineman good it did nothing georgia has believed now this one it s a blow up lsu facing arizona the defense getting it done as well jonathan tenant steps in returns his 141 yards for the touchdown it s <person player="marcus griffin" race="UNK" position="DB">marcus</person> russell five yards that gigapascal russell looked great all day today throwing the ball and lsu is dropping but arizona was is bad if lsu was good they couldnt get a snap from center throwing interceptions and with some field goals everything all right what we find out about notre dame today are they that good or is penn state not as good as i thought they might be did we probably found out the georgia tech is pretty darn good good and did a good job against notre dame s offense and we also probably found out that penn state may not be what we thought they were anthony morelli and that offense at penn state had some chances in the game early on when notre dame wasnt scoring to have some points on the board they didnt do it we said it we said hey notre dame is going to come back and pound them in the second half and they did that s what happened second half the intensity level picked up for notre dame they became more physical we didnt think they were real physical in the first half notre dame second half they got physical as well as making the plays and penn state look pretty much flattened the whole day alright continuing with florida facing the central florida and this one urban meyer going to have a little cape walking this and right number seven chris leak ten yards did alex baker at this point it s a twenty seven to nothing lead and you know i watch game day at leak horsell said this was going to be a closer than the experts make i dont know really clears twentyfive yards the andre caldwell 34 to nothing that you score there now air force in tennessee the expect to blow up tennessee at a big win last week against cal well erica ames look pretty good today real solid all day long throw on the ball even though the game is still closed in the fourth quarter ames has thrown the ball with precision all day long looking like a big time for the guys that one is not over minnesota against cal cal is a team of tennessee beat up on last week eight long floor to desean jackson 48 yards this one covers is kylie s minnesota 21 to 14 <person player="nate jones" race="UNK" position="WR">nate</person> redeeming himself for last week ill tell you what he looked real sharp today over 20 are attacking in the first half last week big brother miami also had to play on monday night they get florida a&amp;m this time around charlie <person player="nate jones" race="UNK" position="WR">jones</person> five yards on this run 14 to nothing kyle right also had a good day and you know what <person player="justin riley" race="UNK" position="WR">riley</person> right just following up building what he had lastly can you imagine oh miami going out and having fresh legs i guess can move no i mean not too much but ill tell you what this is last year the agreement between miami and florida state to play that monday night game im not betting on the very quickly that deal certainly not bobby bowden speaker on when we come back we will have goal of today s schools highlights big hit advance for was a preview of monday night football to our espnu city college balls last season texas traveled to ohio state for their first ever meeting with a buckeye and their defense kept it close in the second half vince <person player="selvin young" race="UNK" position="RB">young</person> connected with linus weed with just over 2 minutes remaining to take the lead when long horn defense preserved the victory when brian robeson recovered a justin swift fumble late in the game this is espn on abc john saunders programs and doug flutie time now for the no hubbell highlights we begin with a theme that drop in the polls despite the fact that they won last week speech slate was himself again well the question today was whether or not he gets 300 yards rushing this <person player="selvin young" race="UNK" position="RB">young</person> man in this football team is getting ready for the long run syracuse against iowa this one was not supposed to be a game it was pass interference is going to be called down here the red ball at the 24 from past interferences the highlight this is an ugly game alright big field goal by syracuse to tie it in the last second two things though to add to sheitel in overtime now syracuse gets another call down at the line they still cant get it in at three fraud a tried against that i would defend theyve held up clemson against boston college another game that went to overtime this point after was blocked and it was key because boston college would come back whitworth whitworth rather on a six yard touchdown run it s high 233 now the kicker defensive and put it through with tell murray flutie that was a big big win against the ranked opponent at home for boston college nebraska facing nicholls state that <person player="taylor price" race="UNK" position="WR">taylor</person> got it going today 42 yards here to purify now you know i understand that you know no laughing it s the nickel and dime state that theyre playing today but the bottom line is that <person player="taylor price" race="UNK" position="WR">taylor</person> is getting better he s completing passes now the question is can that blackshear defense can they match what <person player="taylor price" race="UNK" position="WR">taylor</person> s doing on offense because we have not seen a nebraska defense really dominate anybody in quite a while and they have usc next week in primetime right here on abc usc this week steve smith patrick <person player="thad turner" race="UNK" position="WR">turner</person> couple receivers for usc this week making comments about john david booty a quarterback about how good he is he takes more chances than matt leinart he s got a stronger arm than matt leinart they believe this guy s the leader talk about a team that reloads saying all the right things about their quarterback and he did impress me at arkansas the way he handled himself but again john david booty on his backside is what the blacks are attempt to hope for at nebraska

mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt mccoy</person>to run to no huddle offense bloody option play roll out and every once in awhile now if youre ohio state just do this for yourself a favor kid number 10 the ball every time boyd smith has had 219 yards a two touchdown he s averaged 17 yards per completion in the first half the guys having a heisman tonight right here one versus two toy smith is the difference between these 15 and of the longhorns secondary growth or budding dirt there s some confusion back there remember markers ribbon starting safety not get an injury so already with brown out griffin injured some things to sort out in the back get to the longhorns in the second half and the second half will be coming right up from austin texas as these messages the word from your abc station youre watching espn college football on abc million it weekdays at 6:30 on wea are oh saturday night football on abc and number one ohio state striking with less than 30 seconds to go in the first half leash number two texans by a touchdown welcome back everybody i brought musburger with kirk herbstreit bob davie and kirk that last touchdown pass there were some interesting things well what im seeing right now are two even football team could be the only difference its troy smith troy smith is 13 and 19 in the first half for 219 yards biggest play right before the half recognized oneonone coverage was set again and he makes the audible at the line of scrimmage with his hands the gestured is that what the hand indicates the ted against it s oneonone when i liked is how he look the safety breath the outside rightful petty game to make the catch and how about the maturation may begin of the receiver laughter the fake move right there as he seeks the bump and run coverage by last week troy smith threw for 297 yards and three touchdowns the first half tonight snorted 19 yards at two more touchdowns lexa s will get the ball to start against smith and the buckeyes silva <person player="selvin young" race="UNK" position="RB">young</person> and on kazakh are back deep fielded on the bounce biphobic down at the 20 yard line our time delight first half statistics look like this and bobby s you look at is what jumped up off that page there he jumps out at me is the problem tech repairs in the secondary trying to defend the pass of ohio state what doesnt show up in his stats is the points of troy smith we saw in this matchup a year ago bench <person player="selvin young" race="UNK" position="RB">young</person> take his team to into columbus and play with such great poise and now a year later were seeing the first half very similar attitude from the ohio state quarterback behind hopeful he is quarterback the entire game number 12 his second start and money back <person player="jamaal charles" race="nonwhite" position="RB">charles</person> and let s check in with lisa what did coach mike brown had to say well brent matt brown told me that he told his kids at halftime to keep the confidence he said look guys we came from behind last year at the horseshoe it came from behind at the rose ball you just got to stay in as you tried to tie the game up for the first five minutes of the second half i also asked him when he told us yesterday that he was not telling anything into the fourth quarter why he challenged that fumble in the first quarter he said one of my kids said it was a bad call i didnt come off on the reef light i want to keep my challenge but was at the critical kind of game but i thought i had to use it it was a mistake i think it is a handoff on the play and again first god for all led by <person player="jamaal charles" race="nonwhite" position="RB">charles</person> in the 31 yard line he knows i wasnt in football game we really havent been<person player="jamaal charles" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jamaal charles</person>number 25 it s old yet but keep in mind here s a 10 100 meters im gonna make a strong statement i think that he thought this football player in the country on the field and i had a good game jim okay theyre not prepared for it maybe puffed him into a hundred yards out to the ballgame that would be this whole stadium would stay and watch first and ten picked off laurinaitis who s had a monster night for the eyes with the interception and there was a striking distance again course youre going to get a chance to see what<person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt mccoy</person>s these right here come from behind the quarterback so how about james laurinaitis a game like this of this magnitude first with this stage this kind of games changed <person player="selvin young" race="UNK" position="RB">young</person> guys live this guy tonight is the big hit on the goal line early in the game cause bumble and now the big interception and the taste guys it s the first mistake weve seen for the texas border back a <person player="selvin young" race="UNK" position="RB">young</person> quarterback making his first start the big game and larry knight has been all over the field<person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt mccoy</person>didnt even see number 33 now first and ten handoff the puttin hours into the middle of that corn he mentioned <person player="derek lokey" race="UNK" position="DL">derek</person> the low key the nose man from denton texas and there is puckett ebrake davis upstairs coming down the mistake that was made on the field and i think this is key right now how does<person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt mccoy</person>bounce back last week in his first college game against north texas it was easy we look at great day that the offensive coordinator how resilient is<person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt mccoy</person>he talked about that all day the adversity finally hitting how does he be fun it s exactly riding with all the pressure inspectors try to come back on his shoulders second ante sound goes fist the strong enough to hold on to the football hit from behind by robeson and brian robertson who himself dropped 15 pounds at the defensive end youre going to see him coming from the backside he beat alice soon the 325 table offensive tackle the curt is speed over five speed and effort what an amazing job by rover for the comfort of backside to come down and not give up on the play to bring down troy smith third and 15 either one chord with angling and short of the first sound as<person player="michael griffin" race="nonwhite" position="DB">michael griffin</person>one of the twenties alongside <person player="marcus griffin" race="UNK" position="DB">marcus</person> is a safety when they played in high school michael who here looking at he was the quarterback and how about the call on both long gene trestle comes with the little counter play hit and breaks it outside there s no one out there for the offensive guard downing to block sets up a makeable field goal right now for the and and one on there his drive and penny a guy misses 31 different angle got this one in one of two and that one from the left edge plus a little guys add three go up five cant down seventeen seven take advantage of the interception or done to code one memorable monday night till gibson washington begin their championship run okay

athenian man ill tell you if you thought it we found a guy who you can step pretty good down there now i am it smith now he s pretty nimble that s right brent the nfl s alltime leading rusher and emmett youve been cutting a rug all summer ill get to that but a couple of minutes ago you said were watching the national champion i got to ask which one needs a gin ginger you said you think were watching the potential now i think so i mean ohio state definitely have the better ball blower you talk about the quarterback position and some other skill positions i mean they kind of neutralizing stuff at the quarterback position it s such a key role in this ball game i think ohio s they have theirs and theyre that kind of good im gonna ask you about your dancing after this point yeah we want to hear about that which will come back down in net right now the heat is on young<person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt mccoy</person>and they did a very comfortable pass and let s go back to all right and we always know that you were good on your feet but youre a competitor and dancing with the stars and she even youve been training for five weeks out of it it s been fun it s been a challenging as you can see right here you look at the video right now i mean i have to work hard to get good at it so it s been fun though ive had a lot a lot about encouragement by cheryl my partner she s been a great instructor and so you know im going to be trying to take it in and soak up as much knowledge as i what advice <person player="jared norton" race="UNK" position="LB">jared</person> i figure he told me was gonna be hard he said hed be prepared to practice the minimum of three to six hours a day and then i have been prepared to do so ive been having a

<person player="frank okam" race="UNK" position="DL">frank</person> well baby inlet one is go on put in a minute with that form of atlanta i thought maybe the guy in a rut janet or there s a football game breaking out at seven he picked up 17 yards on that so let me just remind you that the emmitt will be dancing with the stars and that s live tuesday at 8/7 central only honks abc bitch you still there very right before such a driver whenever you say that was good inside succotash off the cause and for the first down very briefly you go allamerican linebacker number six says jim crustle continues to use a lot of manpower down here in austin dimension fact jokingly said to me there s one thing wrong with this were not playing it i do not care to the humidity there we got plague disease at night theyre down and four yards for the horn we trail it behind ten and that s that right there really helps the <person player="selvin young" race="UNK" position="RB">young</person> quarterback texas ability to run the football but i think there will have to throw the football right here talk on fire before weird do not pay the doing and in nicely out of washington he was over there and tonio smith antonio smith actually read the plays and went out with the running dog in a <person player="selvin young" race="UNK" position="RB">young</person> quarterback hung his pill back delvin <person player="selvin young" race="UNK" position="RB">young</person> i was a little bit right here and you see washington right there break on the football fortunately kirk that ball wasnt jarred out of there antonio smith has had a big night tonight for the icd but he showed blitz recognized and he thought the throw would go out to the flat to the back and got back over there to help donald washington out in hilversum tonio smith a great story excuse me first team charged timeout so our first time out in the second half and again that s something that mac brown didnt want he did not want a timeout used because the change in the timing rules he wanted to take all three into the fourth quarter so right now with the defending national champions at the favor to this game things are not going their way saturday night football on abc presented by southwest airlines the low fare from here to there it s on southwest airlines at southwestcom chevrolet america s brand chevy an american revolution pacific life for insurance annuities and investments choose pacific life the power to help you succeed and nike gridiron the ohio state buckeyes lost in the fourth quarter a year ago in columbus but right now here in austin texas they lead 17 to 7 after the timeout <person player="greg johnson" race="UNK" position="P">johnson</person> in going to let this play weve seen some outstanding punting on both sides here tonight ooh very very powerful late let s go to new york now and john saunders john oh but it s an outfit in prime time pulse you can see jordan right now oval south carolina they push that lead to eat see nothing fresno street will go organ three to nothing but it s clearly in that contest that s your primetime pulse right becky right john here at 77 the buckeyes now fresno state hosting origin willing to go in and play them in our home territory that s what we wanted to keep an eye on dipping into the middle and baba know who s been very solid at linebacker makes this up troy smith is starting to gain a reputation for performing well in the big games you can see tonight he s off to a great start to go back to think about the way he played against michigan <person player="jayson white" race="UNK" position="RB">white</person> playing against notre dame in a fiesta bowl coming into this game he s played his best in two big games completing 69% of his passes with five touchdown passes and two touchdown run with 377 yards of total offense in those big games he continues that trend tonight in a big one obviously here in austin second and eight hiten for the first down powerful running play now troy smith let s go back to a year ago because justin zwick do through the sorted competent and there are many many good was we believe that if number ten had been the starting quarterback that night and then played every snap that they would have won the game now hit himself points out not so fast my friends because it was working through the past that the tight end rob it wasnt that a painful drop of the end zone that might have been game set and match buckeyes win it but troy smith has matured as an individual off the field as well as on he was at the elite eleven what about camp in california and he made a tremendous impression on the youngsters out there he stood in front of them and said look i made a mistake and i paid for it i took money when i should just i want you tell us to listen now to somebody who with the wrong way and dont you make that same mistake it was a powerful powerful speech and i cannot tell you how impressive troy smith has become off the field around columbus when you go talk to him and you look back to the days and you give jim tressel and this coaching staff so much but it with a maturation roy smith and now pop davie would probably put everybody in the world would rent ten and that s right as a drift captain my vote for me right here but hell do that we just a little flag tired down there down false start 75 often fiveyard penalty still second down troy smith has been the difference in the game because of the way he s been able to spread it around anthony gonzalez early fed again had the big play before the half and you look at the results but i think it s the leadership something you cant always see the intangibles of a quarterback on the road number one against number two because they have a calming effect on the rest of the team not just the offense to the entire team have been a 15 and this is your portable risk is his third catch a knife okay something ive really been impressed with is just overall team speed of how oh hi oh state has matched up against us we knew our state had some individual guys that could run her but just as a team i thought it would have the speed advantage sometimes malvina but especially on heating we can do it so many cleared returning on all painful hi oh state was pretty gifted on that side of all but the way there s <person player="selvin young" race="UNK" position="RB">young</person> defense is blowing our outside something very impressive 39 we can play <person player="selvin young" race="UNK" position="RB">young</person> receiver number 80 ryan look 50 who s dead as a coach of the cleveland brown wow you have to make that catch on burden i never been a huge conversing with each other yeah hey i was gonna pee where they really like were busy the future that he has but the <person player="selvin young" race="UNK" position="RB">young</person> player like big big play down 30 more and at some point stuck to his leg a country in block kicks over the last five years dont take for granted protection right now i mean he commuted <person player="aaron ross" race="UNK" position="DB">ross</person> infection size of 50 yard line that was the amount of a cloud so it is saturday night football on abc tonight austin texas next saturday los angeles john saunders in new

feel very key defensive plays haunted by law hottest potato refers to him as texas pounding on the colon was just a separate play in the first play of the second half on offense protective james laurinaitis destined front and get the interception soon huge game two huge plays now with a loss of bobby carpenter anthony schlage oh and of course aj hall they needed somebody to see who would emerge at the leader at big game insofar as my tinnitus sucking in one theyre going to the peppers first on the move to change and well the one thing that texas has not been able to do tonight cooking finish what they started only the warning long story behind bolton boy otherwise they have but if you think back a year ago of just putting depaul in big <person player="selvin young" race="UNK" position="RB">young</person> hand what if the seventeen seven game in your dime uncharted waters right now at often first out for mccoy well go over the lifetime incomplete and they lose it down had a shot at it down field that time and that was jer michael <person player="jermichael finley" race="nonwhite" position="TE">finley</person> the talented future tight in here and let me go back now to the prince <person player="selvin young" race="UNK" position="RB">young</person> story because after the rose bowl let s remember the been said i was coming back to school im going to do it again and the coaches dad said yeah we might have that s for one more year in the there was a phone call mac brown toes and vince a coach said i could come over and see it mac said sure come on over vince and mac said i looked at the front door and i saw the <person player="jayson white" race="UNK" position="RB">white</person> limo pull up on the goal i knew he was gone but never did i think that bugs a

position="WR">limas</person> wed gone they have not tried to get their most talented wide receiver the football may be here on third down they try to look for an isolated against an ohio state please down in a box where is inside wide open pillory park were dragged dont buy the linesman coming back things have not gone right with the defending national champions here tonight and what makes it really difficult it s going to put them in about a third and 15 situation holding 79 offense 10yard penalty previous pot still first down big cody <person player="tony hills" race="UNK" position="OL">hills</person> the only new starter on the offensive line for texas was a tight end right there he grabs the jersey of number 1 <person player="marcus griffin" race="UNK" position="DB">marcus</person> freeman honey <person player="tony hills" race="UNK" position="OL">hills</person> making it one of his few thoughts but he found a 30 been a good for quite a bit last year filling in for jonathan funk in this game against ohio state that s what his guys going against i was the total failed in 15 rock puppet queen cause that s off a brothel but their wells go to the hose down exactly what <person player="greg johnson" race="UNK" position="P">greg</person> davis wanted to avoid getting off schedule with the down in distance with a <person player="selvin young" race="UNK" position="RB">young</person> quarterback you want to avoid second eight second nine third and 11 third and 13 really get you know opportunity to have a long drive so penalties and i think it s q right now for texas mack brown s get that offense together over there get<person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt mccoy</person>around his teammates because right now you sense a lot of confidence in that texas offense goes back to the interception to start to have in the pounding for gonzales will join them again <person player="greg johnson" race="UNK"

the hand for the puck tonight seven catches 122 yards and a score for number 11 the last two incompletions by troy smith were dropping passes by the wide receivers the receivers have had a good night but it s one on one again why was they spreading the texas defensive secondary all over the field one on one opportunity that time by anthony gonzales to make a big play like this an indestructible what they thought the time and i look up the home rudeboy and out of bounds over there on that far sideline any georgia coach the buckeyes lamb heisman trophy winner is in attendance and so true is chris carter their outstanding wide receiver and they easy look down at eddie goes there he was there last night for opening and you think there s eddie moved on up the way there s chris me and eddie were were together for a while near the collect such as a part of the kicking game designed the same jewelry department deal with i wrong nor to the 40yard line let s take a look at the pack light game summary here kirk it s been a multiple thing but of course it s been troy smith he s been the difference in this game making big plays here the biggest play probably right before the half finding steady get isolated going to the audible making the play but also the defense line item with a big hit one of the turnovers that ohio state s been able to force and theyve been able to put pressure on the quarterback for foot boy this time nice scene lera nida throwing it right into his chest early in the second half for a pick i own states had the upper hand because the experience and their <person player="selvin young" race="UNK" position="RB">young</person> defensive played very well against both before so that s your pacific life game summary 1420 and texas needs to get something gold in our beautiful throw that pie by mccoy and there is line of creed and i dont think he s covering the second quarter that time texas is a nice job of protecting the quarterback poker boy giving him time to look into the coverage saw oneonone coverage they made a great program and protections this is what they needed to start to drive you had an open receiver underneath it inside of the pants on in finland just a big throwdown finish thank you yards comes underneath a short gain kicked off a submission detective going nohuddle a lot of times you see a team go to and no huddle to try to create some tempo to get up get to the line of scrimmage left thinking try to become the aggressor with the equipo with interesting with texas no huddle shotgun there s no snap count because all the gun early silent snap when the ball moves separately inside handoff eliyahu had to push down and can a horns finish district drive off and make a stand here very important for <person player="greg johnson" race="UNK" position="P">greg</person> davis knock you in bandung the run nice balanced attack got a big pro by gopal boy downfield and im getting hit continue to mix it up and be aggressive with the playground it s always from seven yards in all trolls and theyre credible in the football going for it all and a battle let s see if you live off incomplete take a look at the at the replay a ruling complete did not have possession for two officials right there you saw a good picture of them looking to each other we fit when do they going to get the football at the lima swede this time they try to take advantage of his great size at 65 going up and over malcolm jenkins the best cover corner for ohio state malcolm jenkins actually takes the ball away from lyman swede and then when they fell to the ground nobody had possession and by the time they did theyre out about and line was swede at that got away cook the foot his left hand on malcolm jenkins shoulder and hug and down a little bit but what a great effort by three excellent coverage by mouthing pink people doing all the threat of gorilla second down and ten it would involve im adoring for all of it so in this sequence <person player="marcus griffin" race="UNK" position="DB">marcus</person> burnham laurinaitis take it a stop to the eyes this will put them in third and law either team having a lot of success tonight against with defenses on third and third down ohio state 2 of 9 and texas only 2 of 7 then the <person player="selvin young" race="UNK" position="RB">young</person> quarterback how did we handle the situation here folks on 30 moles keeping money big jim s not here perfect exit there s one 21 straight called a receiver dont go away theyre down by ten they would even take a big ol biscuit elizabeth a little decorum theyre going to drop it off the incomplete as selva <person player="selvin young" race="UNK" position="RB">young</person> look down field and brogdon let s see if theyre going to fly along with <person player="greg johnson" race="UNK" position="P">johnson</person> i think i think great coming onto the field that is georgia member transferred here from vanderbilt he was a freshman allamerican trent really good decision by coracoid you can see that he looked down field he wanted to squeeze it on the findlay to tied in but because ohio state dropped the defensive end goal stood it opened it up to the outside <person player="rudy sylvan" race="UNK" position="TE">sylvan</person> youll make their kids he had to shine a first down georgia shouldnt be as a holder this is a 45 no good not even close and it is miss at the 1218 mark of the fourth quarter because they stay back by two swords over five just pulled it off to the right singular allamerica player of the week update notre dame s brady quinn 25 of 36 287 yards three touchdowns without a pick alana quinn all irish text vote 8 7 6 5 4 near singular while i was home to vote and with that strong performance by notre dame the vote following this game and the tooth holes is going to be interesting at this stage you would expect texas to drop a couple of not but the usc was too cool order youre a danger that that supposes were going to be very interesting and the buckeyes going to work on the clock which brings up something that background dislikes intently and that is the climb starts after a change of possession so down by two scores now with a london fifty to go you know bob davie you have been there the pressure that this puts on your offense when youre trying to play catchup particularly because brent ohio state has the ability to play with a pull back in the game lineup and run the ball computer go back there in over one box spread the first they can kinda little theyre not too quick invincible fair often but with forecasted experience theyre not be surprised if you can continue to give even at the front window gunner second and nine putting a mcginn pan didnt get the purse down he guys first out for the buckeyes and a penalty flag is thrown further downfield the one point that we must make here tonight the longhorns have missed terrell brown the organizations that great job number 31 in the defense fiveyard penalty back on the end of the run the play resulted <person player="aaron ross" race="UNK" position="DB">ross</person> owls had his hands full with ted ginn here tonight a <person player="aaron ross" race="UNK" position="DB">ross</person> has been isolated a lot tonight on number 7 pro high o state they call the incidental faith math were going to add five yards on against texas but you have to go back to the playbook second law theyre taking that they may want to try to run some clock because showed you how much confidence they have in fort smith making frozen making the decision that they could still be aggressive now maybe get back the one in the football the kers believe the throw is the best corner is texas even though he doesnt have winding feet and he s missing that i suspended they come back the gonzales over there and smith is moving the ball through the air and what a senior quarterback my god it went through all the choices does for you is the confidence of jim tressel to throw this football here a lot of confidence weve seen it now three plays in a row but again going back to brent s point if<person player="brandon foster" race="UNK" position="DB">brandon foster</person>the <person player="selvin young" race="UNK" position="RB">young</person> corner who steps ed more sorell brown weve seen it all night whether it s been<person player="brandon foster" race="UNK" position="DB">brandon foster</person>ryan <person player="ryan palmer" race="UNK" position="DB">palmer</person> the griffin brothers isolated ohio state and taken advantage of matchups away from<person player="aaron ross" race="UNK" position="DB">aaron ross</person>to try to exploit the texas defense without for elle brown and we and then let s not forget he had help defensible huh is with the raiders griffin s with the vikings and here <person player="billy pittman" race="UNK" position="WR">pittman</person> is just sweating that horn he plants for another person and then so there are so many key players missing from this long horn theme very very impressive drive here by ohio state walking downfield by the receivers top cars running by antonio goodman but if it the way they are able to mix up the play calling here late in the football game when youre expecting them to be conservative they continue to a confidence that they have in the quarterback voice miss pj downing s off at the garden waistlock both on that s life both start 75 offense fiveyard famines gopher stop brent how impressive this is when you put it in perspective background 44 and 3 at home in this state he lost two games in 1999 is second year 44 and 3 and on top them but he took a shot tonight it s been ported hard tonight it s a real struggle juliette said they found that that mean practice yet near the golf cart he s having a hard time moving around and im sure it s difficult standing especially the way theyre playing there s the penalty flag thrown by the umpire you all know what that means underflow 933 the buckeyes working on that clock im totally obviously moves ohio state bats second penalty in a row or as we continue to talk about terrell brown it s not just physically losing terrell brown it s miscommunication in that secondary every time theyre dropping back to throw their open receivers downfield holding offense comer fitrah beauty 10yard you and previous spot so first out let s go daddy hd senior center from warren ohio earlier it was the sophomore tackle alex food and moved over to that left tackle spot daddy she moved off of it is centered there so boom as ive laid it out as an aide tonight but he has a tremendous upside he was ago or the very top offensive line that plaster both of these schools that could terminate serving that s more specific try to stay inbounds the clock continues to run there comes the penalties like in a facemask hold on rodrik muckelroy boring grabbing the pace mass number 38 you seen shaking his head knowing what happened if it s a personal foul theyre going to be kicking themselves after ohio state had to miss cues with the penalties of their own personal foul twice man number 38 underneath man 15 yards down into the run automatic burns out muckleroy gets out there but he holds on to that facemask equipment and pulls anything you pull there s an official there it s not only a face mask but it s 15 yards in the first down and the freshman roderick muckleroy getting the stars tonight because the junior through kelton couldnt go but that is huge he was close it was almost back to the point where they were probably ready to settle maybe for a field goal now the first down the hands of <person player="billy pittman" race="UNK" position="WR">pittman</person> allowing straight ahead last year of course we let me check that that was as well the divine uh freshman running back there he is right there somebody correct myself not a christian freshman from akron ohio and the activity today do a self prod against north carolina state now we are see the fitment has come onto the field replace to imagine akron and a neighborhood where you have in the same area chris wells and <person player="cory michner" race="UNK" position="DL">cory</person> pippin power all the labor safety we may have some talent for going over there for life and being he interrupted in the plane and that was brian robeson when he does that one of the more athletic and offensive linemen of the country jumping up and copied it down jim brussels now third a knee and checking that that playbook that usually is lethal the situation like this he knows how the use of clock very conservative he pointed out he s got the added advantage of a veteran quarterback he can put on situation let s be with dressler and oh so forth first out buckeyes inside the 10yard line and number 80 brian rowe biscay cowboy cleveland makes the play of the first now you have to love it brian rowe 50 kirk comes back at the drop of the ball on the critical third down earlier how about the conference with provo balaji internet situation fits a confidence theyre aggressive again but going back i hate to continue to pound on this but <person player="brandon foster" race="UNK" position="DB">brandon</person> sponsor for in between the pins im always bow and heaving coverage in a big third down play grant posted walking foot him and allow the biscay pick up the first down aint even hand off and battling for the goal line <person player="neil jereb" race="UNK" position="DB">neil</person> <person player="billy pittman" race="UNK" position="WR">pittman</person> ball carrier he s second down and goal you would think the way things are gone youre denied him russell and the bug eyes and score 7 here it will be being set and match still got seven minutes ago lots of things can happen but the texas architect not phenix folks it here tonight nine plays 70 yards over five minutes off the clock mixing the run with the throw the advantage in college football of having a quarterback they can make quick efficient and give you that truck the pony play you are yeah i think john from the fullback might have dropped the hammer for the end zone they want the signal nothing yet on the game touchdown antonio pitman my mission has this one in hand now it would take a texas miracle to pull this out a great effort here brent inside here just a good push by the offensive line from penetration by <person player="robert killebrew" race="UNK" position="LB">killebrew</person> but hard running that time and he gets the push and <person player="billy pittman" race="UNK" position="WR">pittman</person> shows he has the come completed down to the goal line to get it ball into the end zone this is one that they should review to take a look to make sure that the ball broke the plane as the officials come in and remember mack brown cannot challenging the already used his talent that very tacks on the extra point 24/7 so we go back to the point we made earlier in this game we want to take that challenge to the fourth quarter even if you are going to lose it make sure youve got it laurie smith with the buckeyes have this one well under control 24/7 dominated you go back to the key play in this game and it will could be laurinaitis or see the fumble very early in the game but it looked like the longhorns were going to strike and eddie george i asked the heisman trophy winners enjoy this one down on the sideline having a little fun with detective fan why not one thing all those nfl players say the texas players were talking about this yesterday all those guys in nfl fall back okay look the best time you ever than a half with when youre in silence no no justin blaylock he thought we talked to roy williams until this and one of the reasons why he came back would be for seven 6:27 to go number one and control the ohio state buckeyes and theyre going to be challenged for a seidel all the way vishu saturday night football on abc presented by southwest airlines the low fare from here to there it s on southwest airlines at southwestcom next generation thinking broaching by the nissan versa and all state are you in good hands tonight s aerial coverage been brought to you by outback steakhouse background until the sole anecdote about president of the united states president bush is a big big texas fan he likes go to bed early at night the rose bowl was fill unfolding he tried to go off at about seven minutes ago he got up at he had to watch the rest of the game and i tell you sir tonight the <person player="jayson white" race="UNK" position="RB">white</person> house he s covered himself 24/7 now with six minutes to go it concerns you here a texas fan is not only losing this football game but all the production s theyve had the past under mack brown lot that had to deal with the way this were able to get it done with vince <person player="selvin young" race="UNK" position="RB">young</person> being very versatile but the thing that ive seen tonight playing it harm they didnt show as much fire and intensity if they played with last year now were going to say that all the buildable kill i dont know they were shut out by oklahoma their life not last year but the year before in 2004 illegally fired nothing youre the shooter know anybody there give up on the walking coming none of this babies right now there s a football players back they had a they had a quarterback suspended they got it normally lester over there at quarterback that s pretty good theyve got some talented football player they ran up against the close saw the knife has been waiting for a year to hammer back for that o tough loss up in columbus both are gonna be challenging for that the champa trippin wont words you said a hands page without accident at all you read them you belong given it up as we really on the cochran topic ohio state i dont know first you live in columbus obviously they were up ice coming down here because this <person player="selvin young" race="UNK" position="RB">young</person> defense last week gave up a lot of yards the northern illinois but they have played out finding and that guy right there number 33 go back to that play early in the game that was the gamechanging play go tonight the other thing coming into the ohio state coach is shock that they they were kind of assuming thing how this team would react but they really didnt know because theyve never been in this kind of situation all of a sudden after the game player starts to surface leadership start the surface and the man that you just mentioned james laurinaitis cook become winning acres for the icd things almost walk army they almost hit that one and theyre gonna have very few consider result one of it one of the great streaks in college patrol is coming to an end and it s not mack browns won eight

mercury launched in beckon sperm inspector jarvis calcio padova future star superstar he came in and early had a chance to go to the rainbow austin he said you know my head was spinning there s so much going on with learning new terminology adjusting to defeat of the game you said i just wasnt ready he said right in the middle of twoadays the light went on i started to a murder you do bored comfortable kind of like i did in high school and now the tandem of antonio <person player="billy pittman" race="UNK" position="WR">pittman</person> and chris will give jin trust the best feel that she has fifty built in high school they thumbs or stop by the gene chizik coach defense in person get out of where there is 29 consecutive games he was the defensive coordinator the unbeaten season and father came in here last year and he is a future head coach waiting to happen he wanted into this season a presenter kirk he s not trust me via nasa decisions he s one of the most impressive assistants youd ever want to be around and he is the full package for something for some organization and who knows maybe theyll keep him right here in austin but he was a wonderful wonderful coach bob davie i dont have to tell you what it s like for our coordinator to be on the winning side for the nine straight cause this is phenomenal in the thing you like about he says it very he s humble he tells you he was at a great program that has a bunch of good defensive players at tommy tuberville and he comes in here to texas and inherited the same thing but youre right 23 lines there s an amazing spun but i love it s how he downplays if we want to come in we all want to talk in the media about it streak and he said you know it s about the players not about me his coach has said he s been around a lot of great players a team that believed that his philosophy and health because a very coordinator future great head coach you know what s amazing to me ohio state now how talented are they they had five firstround draft picks last year that left this program prep and nine overall drafted them down here and do with a 15 later they done football team buckeye so use a timeout here or 141 the end is near and pc you will have the longest wins great when this one ends 11 straight wins ohio state of west virginia with nap now 24/7 in berkeley just had to be a great note here texas doesnt score the first time ever that a number one is road and held the number two to single digits team breaking in nine new defender are also on the road with both sexes so far to 284 yards of total offense and seven points impressive an amazing feat but it s ohio state defense to talk a lot about being chizik the jim haycock on the other side defensive coordinator penetrate job for ohio state well today chevrolet players of the game are the other two exploits but the cocacola toria had a huge night 259 yards and and two touchdown from the recognition of the revered ship fight for troy smith and the buckeyes he may have differing opinions up here about the high took two weeks the reason troy smith is a heisman candidate over his own teammate that again the way he provides leadership and because they hit hands on the football every single play for two okay my thoughts goes that<person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt mccoy</person>s a happygolucky kind of bright guy everything s going great everything s wrong wonderful we will now find out what it s like to be a major college quarterback in a place like austin because i dont care how much they love the name

night and boy he s put together some great games that s just tonight it s wonderful to see this this progress of a <person player="selvin young" race="UNK" position="RB">young</person> man you know some some answers dont think if they fall by the wayside but whatever pilate of reasons in this <person player="selvin young" race="UNK" position="RB">young</person> man i mean there took his punishment came back better than ever it s too start looking at the big picture now for ohio state it s a nonconference game you know conference games always manatees are thinking about a chance to maybe run the table makes a big big games coming up on the world later that will probably have a chance with the employers you bet and theyll have a dandies go down to iowa city there s there s the back of the very future on <person player="jamaal charles" race="nonwhite" position="RB">charles</person> is that definitely first bob it wont be long before he takes one for the house against somebody they play rice i really wanted everybody what s great about him it s you think about him being a track guy running a 10 100 feet and he s a football player who happens to show up and is able to learn again what is not a a track guy he is a tough football player well they found the little star linebacker did man moer endearing laurinaitis is there hamza we found him tonight turkey playing a lot of thinking youre her agree with me nothing is more fun than to come into an environment like this and youve got your little group of four thousand vans and enjoy this victory on the roof about as good as it gets as a football player or coach come into this stadium of distinction especially after the way ohio state and texas had a classic last year in columbus indeed felt that the winner had a shot to get to the national title in the longhorns eventually won i think that s been burning the fans and to the team to give back to have an opportunity to play texas and now to have the upper hand after last year youd probably see a pretty good celebration with the 4,000 fans in the corner when the clock goes off a lot of plassey fans down here i talked to some fun guys who travel down here and they said the hopes have been awful nice go of it didnt they were walking around the streets of austin theyve had a good time i buckeye nation over the earl incentive im sure theyve enjoyed it on the big screen over there athletic electric juice network he was a host perfect group that they value because they want the dynamical meaning a football game ls his pumpkin takes the berserk hidden without my to get baseball i dont know <person player="selvin young" race="UNK" position="RB">young</person> got the cosmic here look at the pittock oclock and he s for the 23 that the final seconds right there and resume lesson macon scott well again i there was a penalty plato that was holy i was wrong about that i thought we might have been a hand right there but so mac brown and his staff will go back to work he still got got plenty while he left on the table one thing about these an early you can gauge the ground you dont want to be losing late this being yesterday but early you can come back a little bit but were going to find out how good texas is in the coming weeks is a much much tougher schedule this year in what they had a year ago and if terrell brown affected this team on defense that s one thing but personally i want to see the fire i wanna see the intensity the leadership at this team played with last year cuz tonight it wasnt on display all i can say folks is that ohio state came to austin and mess with texas and there s a handshake let s go to lisa thanks brent troy it turns out that the difference in the game was that touchdown that you guys scored late in the first half what did you see in that defensive inaudible who was as you noted basic calls all day involving their safety that was a great play but the whole game was a good game you know without the guys up front doing a great job i think really allowed one sack today and now is huge it was them up front now knowing that one of their key corners are suspended for the same how are you able to just pick apart the secondary you know i cant i cant say enough you know more than you know it s our game plan it s our coaches the coaches that they put in english english out of film study and you know were in there with them also but it s our staff you know they do a great job after that heartbreaking loss in columbus last year what s it like for you to get this one here on their turf oh no it s not a revenge thing you know any and every win that we get during the course of the season is doing i think like a lot stress away thank you right thank you lisa troy smith a serious heisman candidate now as he leads the buckeyes to a 247 victory in austin texas and a reminded outta to <person player="lee renfro" race="UNK" position="LB">lee</person> the sportscenter on espn if
