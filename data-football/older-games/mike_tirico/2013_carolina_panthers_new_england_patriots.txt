mike: they have responded five in a row, here they are at 63 and playing a meaningful november home game for the first time in five years last time monday night football was here in charlotte ted ginn has had an impact as a receiver on this team also has made his name as a kick returner back in his ohio state days and earlier in the nfl hes back deep to receive patriots won the toss, deferred the option to the second half <person player="stephen gostkowski" race="nonwhite" position="K">gostkowski</person> will kick it temperatures in the mid50s, it is cool and comfortable, clear and no precipitation in the forecast <person player="stephen gostkowski" race="nonwhite" position="K">gostkowski</person> will kick into a slight breeze <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">cam newton</person> against <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> and the pats were all set in uptown charlotte and off we go the panthers and the pats and ginn, a lot of hang time so carolina will take it over at the 20 yard line so <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">cam newton</person>, number one pick out of auburn, now in his third year, the 24yearold hasnt missed a start starting toward winning ways, when you see his statistics, they dont jump out as they did in the first couple years, because theyre playing more balanced football &gt;&gt; jon: theyre using a lot of weapons, four different receivers with almost 400 yards and <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">cam newton</person> has taken care of the football thats the greatest improvement &gt;&gt; mike: <person player="deangelo williams" race="nonwhite" position="RB">deangelo williams</person> and <person player="mike tolbert" race="nonwhite" position="RB">mike tolbert</person> start in the backfield from the 20 and they will run it with williams, the veteran tried to get to the outside couldnt get away from <person player="brandon spikes" race="nonwhite" position="LB">brandon spikes</person> no gain &gt;&gt; jon: you see a lot of layers of offense, youll see option football, unbalanced formation, no back sets, wildcats and they are balanced, as you said, they are controlling the football 34 minutes a game and the ball distribution is better than it has been in a while here and its the cam factor the <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">newton</person> memories, that people leave the stadium with hes a freak athletically, hell prove it tonight &gt;&gt;

mike: <person player="nate ebner" race="white" position="DB">ebner</person> is a safety, who is a world class rugby player, number 43 and by my stats, <person player="nate ebner" race="white" position="DB">ebner</person> has not played a defensive snap this year third and nine patriots rush four, newtons pass nearly intercepted by <person player="aqib talib" race="nonwhite" position="DB">aqib talib</person> who was step for step with <person player="steve smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">steve smith</person> theyll see a lot of each other as the fight goes on &gt;&gt;

mike: <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">julian edelman</person> at the 40 yard line, there is no one deep right now you see <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">edelman</person> to the right now he runs back to catch the punt from the second year man its a beauty fair catch for <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">edelman</person> at the 29 yard line on a windy night, 50 yard kick, <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">edelman</person> had to go back and get <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> takes the field and jon told you, the stats arent as good as they usually are but everything came together a couple weeks ago against pittsburgh 55 points the best <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> stat night of the season &gt;&gt; jon: if there was a statistic for hard work behind the scenes, <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> would be leading in that category &gt;&gt; mike: patriots start from the 30 bradys first pass for <person player="danny amendola" race="white" position="WR">danny amendola</person> is ruled a catch a gain of three in front of the rookie <person player="melvin white" race="UNK" position="DB">melvin white</person> &gt;&gt;

mike: here is <person player="stevan ridley" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ridley</person> bouncing outside a good run by ridley, gets a first down out of bounds into panther territory at the 43 yard line a gain of 13 here at the back end of the quarter and just a quick mention, that completion by <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> was his 4,000th of his career and another mark for tom after one, here in carolina, the panthers lead the patriots 70 on monday night football &gt;&gt; mike: that last completion for <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> gets him to 4,000 on his career now a half dozen, and the usual suspects up there favre is ahead of manning, then marino, brees, elway, now <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person>, the sixth to 4,000 completions pressure and sacked for the second time tonight by <person player="star lotulelei" race="nonwhite" position="DT">star lotulelei</person>, first round pick out of utah, gets his second career sack &gt;&gt; jon: awfully hard to move the football on sustained drives against this carolina panther defense when you pull the back side guard, the center has to block back there was no chance against lotulelei, who might be a big time rookie of the year candidate on defense and they had that guy last year, <person player="luke kuechly" race="white" position="LB">luke kuechly</person>, mike &gt;&gt; mike: after a loss of nine, <person player="danny amendola" race="white" position="WR">amendola</person> down to the 38 yard line, credit <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">rob gronkowski</person> with a good block &gt;&gt; jon: how about this right tackle, hes 355 pounds watch this athleticism, he leads this quick screen thats a big body moving, mike throw and roll on the perimeter, if youre a line man, thats how you do it &gt;&gt; mike: <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> complete, <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">edelman</person> got hit hard hes shy of the first down, as mike mitchell, big hitter, who was a draft pick of the raiders come over to caroline arks see what bell click will do on fourth and two &gt;&gt; jon: watch mike <person player="michael mitchell" race="UNK" position="DB">mitchell</person> on this arrow route have to be careful using the crown of your helmet, <person player="michael mitchell" race="UNK" position="DB">mitchell</person> has had a lot of penalties fourth and a long one &gt;&gt; mike: into the wind field goal would be tough carolina brings four <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> looking throwing, off the hands of <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> incomplete flag is down on the far side <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">edelman</person> was on the deck being covered by white, well away from the play top of the screen &gt;&gt; jon: <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> was never looking that way &gt;&gt; referee: illegal use of hands, hands to face, defense, number 23, five yard penalty, automatic first down &gt;&gt; mike: that was white covering edelman, the undrafted rookie out of louisiana lafayette will keep <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> on the field &gt;&gt; jon: number 23 clearly got up in the cage of <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">edelman</person> &gt;&gt; mike: once that hand got to the face, it was an easy call so crucial penalty keeps the drive alive couple minutes into the second quarter up the middle on the running play patriots understand what this defense is about and they are exercising poise &gt;&gt; jon: the safeties for carolina play deep they wont give you big chunk plays, you dont want to hold the ball looking for those plays or the pass rush will get you &gt;&gt; mike: back to ridley, trying to get away from <person player="luke kuechly" race="white" position="LB">kuechly</person> not going to do it <person player="luke kuechly" race="white" position="LB">luke kuechly</person>, <person player="charles johnson" race="UNK" position="DE">charles johnson</person> on the tackle and these carolina fans a chanting, lou &gt;&gt; jon: just about every single play they are on the football or making a tackle i dont know if he gets tired &gt;&gt; mike: hes all football, jon you would love him talked to him on the bus he just got cable tv a couple weeks ago, goes home, watches his film, eats his meals, back to the office loves the game glad hes a cable subscriber now third and four can they get to the 20 <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> throws incomplete for <person player="danny amendola" race="white" position="WR">amendola</person> theres a flag down &gt;&gt; referee: personal foul, grabbing the face mask, defense, number 76, penalty is half the distance to the goal line first down &gt;&gt; mike: its on <person player="greg hardy" race="nonwhite" position="DE">greg hardy</person>, takes the patriots down to the 12 yard line &gt;&gt; jon: thats the second third down that has been converted by new england, because of a defensive penalty and <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> clearly gets his face mask grabbed i dont know if its severe they dont want players near the face of the quarterback thats been well documented this weekend &gt;&gt; mike: any shot to the head of the quarterback, couple years ago, even a tap on the head was called a flag then they tried to fine tune the rules, the force of the hit, but that one on the face mask is what they were looking at borderline call, but it keeps the drive alive at the 12 to the right with ridley, firing through is davis, a player whos come off three acl surgeries on the same knee to be playing at a high level &gt;&gt; jon: its clear what carolina is doing, loading the box theyre going to play man to man coverage against these patriot receivers, these young guys and make somebody win the panthers secondary is not backing down against these patriot wideouts &gt;&gt; mike: second and 11 shotgun, lost the football, panthers have it &gt;&gt; jon: thats what they do, mike they count on you self destructing and <person player="stevan ridley" race="nonwhite" position="RB">stevan ridley</person> continues to have fumble problems and this one is a back &gt;&gt; mike: defensive linemen drafted back to back, <person player="star lotulelei" race="nonwhite" position="DT">lotulelei</person> and short, second round pick out of purdue, he caused the fumble on <person player="stevan ridley" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ridley</person> third time <person player="stevan ridley" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ridley</person> lost a fumble this year, second in as many weeks &gt;&gt; jon: that doesnt go over well in this program they have been known to sit backs down, who have fumbling problems, it will be interesting to see what bill belichick does with <person player="stevan ridley" race="nonwhite" position="RB">stevan ridley</person> in the next series &gt;&gt; mike: since the final game in 2011, thats the eighth fumble by <person player="stevan ridley" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ridley</person> the panthers had a 90 yard drive for touchdown earlier, they start from the 13 this time and <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">newton</person> completes to <person player="greg olsen" race="white" position="TE">greg olsen</person> gain of five to the tight end as <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> came off the field at the end of that drive, remember a few weeks ago, the miami game, there was concern about <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person>s hands, he was grabbing his left hand as he came off and had brief attention from the trainers banged up right hand, grabbing at the left well continue to watch <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> you see that cut on the index finger just below it of that left hand right hand <person player="jonathan stewart" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jonathan stewart</person> is the back and carolina is glad to have him back first down by <person player="jonathan stewart" race="nonwhite" position="RB">stewart</person> stewarts third game since an ankle sprain last year, hes been out all season to this point &gt;&gt; jon: you dont know if cam is going to hand the ball off or keep it you just watch the back side of this patriot defense theyre not quite sure if cam is giving it or keeping it and off of the disconnect <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">cam newton</person> drives defenses crazy even if hes not running a zone read or he is you never know &gt;&gt; mike: from the 25 time for <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">newton</person> and he throws sideline, ruled in bounds gain of 17 for <person player="brandon lafell" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brandon lafell</person> &gt;&gt; jon: you have to give the line coach a lot of credit look at right guard <person player="nate chandler" race="UNK" position="DT">nate chandler</person>, right tackle <person player="byron bell" race="nonwhite" position="OT">byron bell</person> there is plenty of time for <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">cam newton</person> to slide left and throw a strike but im telling you, mike, this right guard <person player="nate chandler" race="UNK" position="DT">nate chandler</person> is about the sixth different guard ive seen play here chandler was a defensive lineman playing in games last year for caroline pa thats how <person player="kawann short" race="nonwhite" position="DT">short</person> they are on linemen but <person player="nate chandler" race="UNK" position="DT">nate chandler</person>, number 78, has really helped this offense &gt;&gt; mike: <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">newton</person> keeping this time on the option, just a gain of a yard <person player="rob ninkovich" race="UNK" position="DE">rob ninkovich</person> was patient and disciplined and stayed there talk about chandler, odd story out of ucla, here he is last year playing defensive tackle and he played 135 snaps of defensive tackle last season and once they drafted the players we talked about, <person player="star lotulelei" race="nonwhite" position="DT">lotulelei</person> and short, who caused the fumble, they said to chandler, look, heres the deal, do you want to go try offensive line? he did was a tackle and with all the injuries at guard, they put him at guard now hes the starting guard for the panthers played offense early in his ucla days <person player="jonathan stewart" race="nonwhite" position="RB">stewart</person> goes right jon, let me ask you about this carolina offense because the read option is struggling league wide we see struggles with kaepernick, struck else with griffin <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">cam newton</person> and the carolina read option still has juice and effectiveness why? &gt;&gt; jon: not all they do its a small part of what they do they have a drop back passing system, you saw the wildcat they have an unbalanced line, empty backfield plays, they use just a sprinkle lynn of read option to regulate the defenses and mike shula deserves credit for keeping balance in this panther system &gt;&gt; mike: rob chudzinski was the offensive coordinator first two years for <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">newton</person> he is now head coach for the browns shula replaced him patriots bring pressure, cam has a ton of run to room <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">newton</person> to the 30 yard line 24 yards &gt;&gt; jon: hard to play plan to plan against <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">cam newton</person>, if you dont account for him very good pass protection by the panther offensive line cam doesnt find anyone open and when he puts it down, hes bigger and faster and stronger than anybody you have on defense id drive home at night after watching him play, he has two or three memorable plays great athlete &gt;&gt; mike: just one or two a game that keeps you talking unique talent growing in the position almost a missed hand off, <person player="mike tolbert" race="nonwhite" position="RB">mike tolbert</person> loses a yard, <person player="brandon spikes" race="nonwhite" position="LB">brandon spikes</person> and the rest of the patriots had him outnumbered sometimes wild throws, 54 touchdown throws with one here tonight in 2 1/2 years, 26 rushing touchdowns, 80 combined but 50 or more throwing, 25 or more running no player has done that in the first three years of their nfl career or any three years of his nfl career for that matter and <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">newton</person> has another 6 1/2 games to add to those totals, he already set that mark &gt;&gt; jon: thats why the stadium is packed &gt;&gt; mike: second and ten play packs too high for <person player="greg olsen" race="white" position="TE">olsen</person> and incomplete where is <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">newton</person> on his fundamentals, thats the one thing as a quarterback who is such a good runner, you wonder how good a pocket passer he can be &gt;&gt; jon: hes a work in progress, he executes so many different fundamentals in a game we talked about the different phases of their offense but <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">cam newton</person> is maturing as the leader, leaving his mark on the practice field, more attentive in meetings, having greater input in the meetings, hes setting the tone here in carolina with his work ethic its not going unrecognized by teammates &gt;&gt; mike: play clock running down third and ten <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">newton</person> fires <person player="steve smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">steve smith</person> couldnt hang on <person player="aqib talib" race="nonwhite" position="DB">talib</person> in coverage there is a flag down over in that direction &gt;&gt; jon: they got <person player="aqib talib" race="nonwhite" position="DB">talib</person> &gt;&gt; referee: prior to the pass, holding, defense, number 31 five yard penalty automatic first down &gt;&gt; jon: critical situation, cam loves to go to <person player="steve smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">steve smith</person> got a plus split outside stem, he breaks back inside and good call by the official right now <person player="steve smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">steve smith</person> is getting the best of <person player="aqib talib" race="nonwhite" position="DB">talib</person> &gt;&gt; mike: <person player="aqib talib" race="nonwhite" position="DB">talib</person> has two penalties smith has that big completion earlier on of 42 yards keeps the drive alive from the 25, newton, trying to get outside good play off the edge by <person player="kyle arrington" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kyle arrington</person> from the corner, wouldnt let him get outside its a matchup we saw earlier when <person player="aqib talib" race="nonwhite" position="DB">talib</person> played for tampa, q now now with carolina, they play with with carolina, they play with fire earlier on that 42 yard grab helped the panthers then the ensuing completion to keep the drive going, <person player="aqib talib" race="nonwhite" position="DB">talib</person> hanging on to smiths leg and drawing the 15 yard flag they both knew the other guy was coming to town the 25, newton, end zone shot, too tall for <person player="greg olsen" race="white" position="TE">olsen</person> good step for step coverage by the rookie <person player="duron harmon" race="nonwhite" position="DB">harmon</person> &gt;&gt; jon: <person player="duron harmon" race="nonwhite" position="DB">harmon</person> from rutgers, two rutgers scarlet knights drafted high by bill belichick they both played key roles heres <person player="duron harmon" race="nonwhite" position="DB">harmon</person> flipping his head, finding the ball <person player="duron harmon" race="nonwhite" position="DB">harmon</person> has two interceptions as a rookie, he knows the communication of this defense thats critical you have to know what youre doing to play safety for bill belichick and the intelligence at the safety position is paramount they do a lot of different things on the back end &gt;&gt; mike: a lot of inexperience out there ryan is out there <person player="nate ebner" race="white" position="DB">ebner</person> again out play 11 of another long drive <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">newton</person> incomplete and the panthers will try a field goal &gt;&gt; jon: ginn should have plucked it the ball was thrown on the money thats excellent timing by <person player="kyle arrington" race="nonwhite" position="DB">arrington</person> &gt;&gt; mike: <person player="graham gano" race="white" position="K">graham gano</person> only missed one last week against san francisco but redeemed himself with the game winning field goal from 53 yards this is downwind from 43 and hell knock it through panthers 10, &gt;&gt;

jon: gano, how many touchbacks does he have he leads the league i wouldnt want to be a kickoff returner against <person player="graham gano" race="white" position="K">graham gano</person> &gt;&gt; mike: only matt prater has more &gt;&gt; jon: not that much altitude here is there? &gt;&gt; mike: no but a heck of a lot of wind, a really windy night, the ball has blown off the tee twice so michael will hold it for <person player="graham gano" race="white" position="K">gano</person> doesnt need the wind aid, but he has it and its unreturnable the drive will start from the 20 yard line for carolina been a tough night for the patriots <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> getting hit and going &gt;&gt; mike: last sunday carolina went out to san francisco and beat the 49ers, and then the niners lose their game in new orleans, they lost back to back, this is an important game for san francisco, and who knows whats going on with the redskins will they get going? well see colin kaepernick, <person player="robert lester" race="UNK" position="DB">robert</person> griffin iii, 49ers in <person player="leon washington" race="nonwhite" position="RB">washington</person> to start your thanksgiving week monday night football just outside the nations capitol <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> completes to <person player="kenbrell thompkins" race="UNK" position="WR">kenbrell thompkins</person> for the first down to the 43 yard line &gt;&gt; jon: very good against an aggressive defense back side guard pulls, you see 58 take the fake and that vacates the slant excellent play action designed by the new england patriots and thompkins, nice slant &gt;&gt; mike: <person player="legarrette blount" race="nonwhite" position="RB">blount</person> in the game, a power run, gain of two &gt;&gt; jon: <person player="legarrette blount" race="nonwhite" position="RB">legarrette blount</person> is in there to run the football thats his 71st carry as a patriot, he has no catches so theyre bringing the big man in to slam it and now they go back to <person player="shane vereen" race="UNK" position="RB">shane vereen</person>, third down back &gt;&gt;

jon: this no back set was famous around here in new england for a long time and theres <person player="shane vereen" race="UNK" position="RB">vereen</person> one on one with a linebacker they used to have <person player="aaron dobson" race="UNK" position="WR">aaron</person> hernandez and danny woodhead and <person player="shane vereen" race="UNK" position="RB">shane vereen</person>, and they drove defenses crazy watch <person player="luke kuechly" race="white" position="LB">luke kuechly</person>, just the effort play he makes to get there &gt;&gt;

jon: story of the night so far for the patriots they moved the ball between the 20s, but they havent been able to finish lets see if they can complete a drive against this stingy carolina defense &gt;&gt; mike: into the wind, blount, this is a <person player="legarrette blount" race="nonwhite" position="RB">legarrette blount</person> type of game he gets the first down this is a carolina defense that is very stout in the middle and blount, that power back, that new england has been missing the last few years, gives this team something &gt;&gt; jon: two fresh defensive tackles, number 91 and number 92 they want to beef up the inside to stop this power running game &gt;&gt; mike: two tight ends to the left, <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> releases <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> throws to mulligan, the other tight end, incomplete, covered by <person player="thomas davis" race="nonwhite" position="DB">thomas davis</person>, a flag down at the back end of the play as the pushing and the physical confrontation continues <person player="matthew mulligan" race="white" position="TE">mulligan</person> was in the game, because <person player="michael hoomanawanui" race="UNK" position="TE">michael hoomanawanui</person>, second tight end for the patriots went out a couple plays ago, shaken up &gt;&gt; jon: another penalty i think against the patriots, looks like <person player="logan mankins" race="nonwhite" position="OG">mankins</person> has a hand to the face here &gt;&gt; referee: after the play, personal foul, unnecessary roughness, offense, number 70, 15 yard penalty, it will be second down &gt;&gt; jon: <person player="aqib talib" race="nonwhite" position="DB">aqib talib</person> in the first quarter, <person player="logan mankins" race="nonwhite" position="OG">mankins</person> in the second quarter with post snap penalties, that cant please bill belichick, thats a huge penalty on <person player="logan mankins" race="nonwhite" position="OG">mankins</person> &gt;&gt; mike: especially going into the wind here this wind continues to pick up, gusting i would guess somewhere 15 to 20 miles per hour, right to left, its picking up and you give up 15 yards there, its not going to help you thanks for letting me be your telestrator second and 21 brady, underneath, just a three yard gain for amendola, these linebackers are right around seven tackles each &gt;&gt; jon: i wouldnt want to be a slot receiver against those two linebackers i mean, you have to go in and catch shallow crosses you better protect yourself as well as the football &gt;&gt; mike: at the 2:00 warning of the &gt;&gt; mike: the toyota halftime coming up with chris berman, listen in as the giants go for four in a row and chip <person player="tommy kelly" race="nonwhite" position="DT">kelly</person> and the division leading eagles and the grew den grinders from sunday got some good stuff &gt;&gt;

jon: they will go for it that was an excellent job by <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> using his eyes looking off the underneath coverage to find <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> fourth down, weve seen a lot of aa gap looks lets see what he has in store &gt;&gt; mike: bell click is down by the officials needs to get to the 16 to get the first down <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> takes the timeout they wanted to run it down and take the timeout and &gt;&gt; mike: defensive rookie of the year last year, big night for <person player="luke kuechly" race="white" position="LB">luke kuechly</person> &gt;&gt; jon: how about the effort just watch how many yards he covers getting to the football speed is one thin instincts another but effort hes going 40 yards to find the guy with the ball how about this effort? ive never seen defensive backs run this fast to the ball <person player="luke kuechly" race="white" position="LB">luke kuechly</person> is special unbelievable performance so far eight tackles and a lot of them have just been second and third effort plays &gt;&gt; mike: seven of them solo tackles, tremendous impact player for these panthers, so as brady, whos rarely shut out in the first half, only nine times in 185 games has he been shut out in the first half its up to <person player="stephen gostkowski" race="nonwhite" position="K">stephen gostkowski</person> kicking with the wind whipping and into the wind, a strong kicker who kicks in the new england breeze often trying from 42 yards and <person player="stephen gostkowski" race="nonwhite" position="K">gostkowski</person> able to power it through nice job on the hold by <person player="ryan allen" race="white" position="P">ryan allen</person>, the punter, not a great snap <person player="ryan allen" race="white" position="P">allen</person> put it down put the pats on the board &gt;&gt; mike: they have been together so long, <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> and bill belichick, a few years ago passed shula and marino most wins by a coach and starting quarterback they kept the winning percentage ahead of lombardi and starr but together the head coach and quarterback tonight, game 185 they are the longest running such duo in nfl history surpassing shula and marino, chuck noll, terry bradshaw you spent a lot of time sitting wherever youre watching the game, watching belichick and brady, and those two a somewhat odd couple, the way their personalities are yet they are driven by the passion for the game, the uncanny desire to continue to improve, and to lead and they both do it in different ways but together, they have been as good a quarterback head coach combo as the league has ever known they are down seven ted ginn will return it from five deep terrific return man ginn is eliminated at the 10 yard line special team stop by wilson with 1:06 left &gt;&gt; jon: two timeouts for the panthers, i expect in this field position, <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">cam newton</person> and this panther offense to be somewhat conservative again, mike thats been their mo all year they know they play great defense and they are a plus eight in the turnover margin, because they havent taken a lot of risks id be surprised if they do here &gt;&gt; mike: their fourth drive, they have not had great field position new england does get the ball to start the second half shotgun, newton, surveys, throws underneath to <person player="brandon lafell" race="nonwhite" position="WR">lafell</person> hit hard by ryan after a gain of eight clock turns &gt;&gt; jon: no pass rush whatsoever by this patriot front four they need <person player="chandler jones" race="nonwhite" position="DE">chandler jones</person>, who leads the patriots to deliver &gt;&gt; mike: he and <person player="rob ninkovich" race="UNK" position="DE">rob ninkovich</person> coming from the same tide jones inside move gets to newten and brings him down &gt;&gt; jon: thats the thing i like about jones, hes not just an outside linebacker in a 34 defense hes not just a defensive end he can come over the guard, thats a great job by bill belichick, butting them over, number 78, <person player="nate chandler" race="UNK" position="DT">nate chandler</person>, the person we just talked about, converted defensive lineman im sure belichick told jones, if he blocks you, ill be very disappointed in you thats a nice job by the coaching staff as well as <person player="chandler jones" race="nonwhite" position="DE">chandler jones</person> &gt;&gt; mike: now 9 1/2 sacks, the clock restarts after that sack, no timeout taken either way they will run it down and the half comes to a close patriots get the ball to start the second half if youre wondering if the panthers are for real, so far, the answer might be &gt;&gt;&gt; <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> is going to be sacked &gt;&gt; <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">newton</person> over the middle, caught by <person player="brandon lafell" race="nonwhite" position="WR">lafell</person> carolina touchdown &gt;&gt; <person player="aqib talib" race="nonwhite" position="DB">talib</person> and bill belichick have to regroup &gt;&gt; mike: its been intense, busy, only one touchdown scored 103, panthers over the patriots as we continue here from charlotte, mike tirico, jon gruden, lisa salters, another game the panthers dont give up a first half touchdown, only given up one all season so jon, what do you see from new englands standpoint? how can they get more finish on these drives &gt;&gt; jon: so far they stopped themselves they had a beautiful drive, ended in a <person player="stevan ridley" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ridley</person> fumble they also had a couple key penalties, one on <person player="logan mankins" race="nonwhite" position="OG">mankins</person> after the whistle, another on <person player="aqib talib" race="nonwhite" position="DB">aqib talib</person>, they have to continue to do what theyre doing, be patient, because they have been successful moving the ball but they are self destructing &gt;&gt; mike: one of the big stories is <person player="aqib talib" race="nonwhite" position="DB">talib</person> against <person player="steve smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">steve smith</person> smith left the first half with a chest injury, he is probable well keep an eye on that newtons offense moved the ball effectively in their drives as well and the wind a significant factor in that first half patriots going in the same direction back into it as the third quarter gets underway <person player="graham gano" race="white" position="K">graham gano</person> set to kick off as the third quarter gets underway heres lisa &gt;&gt; lisa: just talked to ron rivera, he said we just need to do a better job tackling, im really disappointed in the job weve done in the first half tackling i asked about matching their temperature ov that is what he was concerned about coming in matching the patriots tempo he said, weve done a pretty good job but what were not doing well is tackling their <person player="kawann short" race="nonwhite" position="DT">short</person> catches instead of three or four yards are turning into 10, 12 yard gains, we cant have that &gt;&gt; mike: you see the numbers to back up riveras point <person player="shane vereen" race="UNK" position="RB">shane vereen</person> starts the drive as the back patriots from their own 20 and <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> setting it up, <person player="shane vereen" race="UNK" position="RB">vereen</person> has a lot of room white with the tackle, new england first down &gt;&gt; jon: nice execution, good way to slow this fast flow carolina defense down with a misdirection screen pass and <person player="legarrette blount" race="nonwhite" position="RB">legarrette blount</person> has checked in obviously bill belichick has benched <person player="stevan ridley" race="nonwhite" position="RB">stevan ridley</person> after the fumble it will be interesting to see if they go back to ridley, whos been a dynamic runner for this patriot team they do not like fumbles, mike &gt;&gt; mike: ridleys fumble came at the end of a 14 play new england drive opening for blount, back to back patriots first downs <person player="shane vereen" race="UNK" position="RB">vereen</person> got 10 1/2, <person player="legarrette blount" race="nonwhite" position="RB">blount</person> got a dozen &gt;&gt; jon: the defensive end is hurt youll see <person player="logan mankins" race="nonwhite" position="OG">logan mankins</person>, the pro bowl guard beat <person player="legarrette blount" race="nonwhite" position="RB">legarrette blount</person>, but theres an injury out here to <person player="charles johnson" race="UNK" position="DE">charles johnson</person>, defensive end of the carolina panthers and this does not look good, mike &gt;&gt; mike: he got tied up with <person player="marcus cannon" race="nonwhite" position="OG">marcus cannon</person> so johnson, the veteran, down for carolina &gt;&gt; mike: <person player="charles johnson" race="UNK" position="DE">charles johnson</person> limping over to the training table there for the panthers, heres what happened &gt;&gt; jon: <person player="marcus cannon" race="nonwhite" position="OG">cannon</person> gets beat, he falls down and leg whips him that should be a 15 yard penalty, and that will be reviewed by the league office &gt;&gt; mike: <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> back to work first down pass complete to <person player="aaron dobson" race="UNK" position="WR">aaron dobson</person> <person player="charles johnson" race="UNK" position="DE">johnson</person> two of the last three years double digit sacks, 8 1/2 this year, and along with <person player="greg hardy" race="nonwhite" position="DE">greg hardy</person>, dont get the national attention but a huge part of how this defense has been so good this year &gt;&gt; jon: they have 23 1/2 sacks combined last year well on the way to surpassing that this year and <person player="charles johnson" race="UNK" position="DE">johnson</person> is a sack strip artist, he has caused 15 fumbles here in carolina &gt;&gt; mike: the doctors doing the acl stability test a <person player="kawann short" race="nonwhite" position="DT">short</person> yard to go, and <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> who has done that so often on the keeper, just finding that little bubble gains the first down new england has a nice drive going here to start the third quarter &gt;&gt; jon: the patriots using a lot of different personnel groupings, they have three tight ends in the huddle, one back and one receiver they mixed it up all night its new here for this patriot offense its a totally different cast of skilled receivers, and right now theyre loading the box with three tight ends and just one receiver &gt;&gt; mike: from the 45, <person player="legarrette blount" race="nonwhite" position="RB">blount</person> working left, powered through the left side youre announcing what youre doing and get it done gain of eight &gt;&gt; jon: thats good football by new england you get a 255 pound i formation tailback run him off the left side behind these tight ends and pull a back side guard to the party and blast the ball off the left side i like what josh mcdaniels is doing they are staying with the same formation, they just flipped it over to the right side &gt;&gt; mike: using the fullback, flipped out to <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">edelman</person> who beat white on the corner, <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">edelman</person> gets the first down &gt;&gt; jon: they run the same play, power play to the right side but carolina loaded the box so <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> throws a one step hitch out there to <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">edelman</person> that time <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">edelman</person> beat the rookie, <person player="melvin white" race="UNK" position="DB">melvin white</person> &gt;&gt; mike: thats what ron rivera told lisa, we have to tackle better nearly deflected by hardy, <person player="shane vereen" race="UNK" position="RB">vereen</person> caught it inside the 20 it will be a couple yards to go on second down inside the 20 on the cart <person player="charles johnson" race="UNK" position="DE">charles johnson</person> the richest panther contract ever signed six years, $76 million, third year into that they go to check on his knee &gt;&gt; jon: hes the leader of the defense, quiet unspoken leader of the carolina defense they have to regroup &gt;&gt; mike: and the run by <person player="legarrette blount" race="nonwhite" position="RB">blount</person> will give the patriots another first down their fifth on this opening drive of the third a flag down thrown in the end zone see if the defense had too many &gt;&gt; referee: 12 men on defense, five yard penalty, yards are enough for a first down &gt;&gt; mike: goes back to the 49ers game carolina has won five in a row, their points allowed 10, 15, 13, 10, 9 new england has been down here in this game panthers without one of their top defensive ends trying to make a stop in the red zone &gt;&gt; jon: first down play action passing has been a big part of this drive &gt;&gt; mike: they spread it out now and from the 14, <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> looking up top going end zone with a flag down couldnt make the one handed grab looks like white had a hand on him &gt;&gt; jon: <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> is going after the rookie &gt;&gt; referee: holding, defense, number 23, five yard penalty, automatic first down &gt;&gt; jon: outside release and you see white get dobsons jersey nice call by the official <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> uses a lot of alerts here listen at home hell call one play and alert it with another he keeps this patriot offense in optimum play selection &gt;&gt; mike: gron cowsy at the top of the screen, he slants in and gronk powers to the goal line and in for the new england touchdown &gt;&gt; jon: thats the first opening drive touchdown of the second half by the patriots this year physical release against michael he runs through three carolina panthers to tie this game what an effort &gt;&gt; mike: ball breaks the plane waiting for the confirmation for what would be the 40th touchdown connection from <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> to <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">rob gronkowski</person> confirmed by the booth <person player="stephen gostkowski" race="nonwhite" position="K">gostkowski</person> to tie the game you go in at halftime and awe just and for the 40th time <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> takes a <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> pass to the end zone game tied at 10 &gt;&gt; mike: 3 1/2 seasons <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">rob gronkowski</person> has caught 40 touchdowns from <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> now passes randy moss who was tied with him 39 touchdowns from <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> hes been such a force such a strong player finishing drives that new england couldnt do in the first half but did here to start the second half after carolina scored the first ten new england responds with ten new game with 10:30 left in the third <person player="kawann short" race="nonwhite" position="DT">short</person> returnable kickoff for ted ginn and ginn cant get past the 20 yard line, wilson for the second time a special teams stop the focus on <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> to gronkowski, 72% completion over their first three years together, 38 touchdowns, just two picks <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> coming back from the arm injury, multiple surgeries, and no <person player="aaron dobson" race="UNK" position="WR">aaron</person> hernandez, and the productivity <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> to gronk has not been the same thus far this year &gt;&gt; jon: they have a lot of new rookie wide receivers, they dont have hernandez, they dont have danny woodhead and <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> is also part of the team here and he doesnt have the supporting cast to take pressure off him like hes had in previous years of the but hes still a great tight end &gt;&gt; mike: first down throw to <person player="brandon lafell" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brandon lafell</person> he works the side past <person player="aqib talib" race="nonwhite" position="DB">talib</person> and they give him nine yards on that first down completion &gt;&gt; jon: how about that play? zone read he can hand the ball off he can keep it or he can throw a builtin drag or slant so he can hand it, keep it or he has the option to throw the ball at the top of the screen these are the kind of things that <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">cam newton</person> brings to the table he and <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> both outstanding quarterbacks in totally different systems &gt;&gt; mike: second and one <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">newton</person> rolling, good decision to find <person player="brandon lafell" race="nonwhite" position="WR">lafell</person> and gain the first down at the 34 take you back to cam in the first half &gt;&gt; jon: he has to do a lot of things, execute play action passes, and make accurate throws, and hes going to have to get out of trouble and use his legs hes going to look over there for <person player="steve smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">steve smith</person>, nobody is open but he has to make another play or two with his legs to beat <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> in a big game this is what ive been wanting to see second half, tie ballgame, <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> versus <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">newton</person> &gt;&gt; mike: from the 34 he has time throws to <person player="deangelo williams" race="nonwhite" position="RB">deangelo williams</person>, open field tackle by <person player="duron harmon" race="nonwhite" position="DB">harmon</person> will limit the first down gain &gt;&gt; jon: im surprised <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">cam newton</person> didnt throw the deep cross to <person player="steve smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">steve smith</person> zone defense and cam had plenty of time but <person player="steve smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">steve smith</person> was wide open down the field but you cant argue with success you cant go broke in the pocket high percentage completion but im surprised cam didnt throw the ball to his favorite target there &gt;&gt; mike: smith in motion read right from the start by <person player="kyle arrington" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kyle arrington</person> fifth year man out of hofstra you awe newton, smith broke open where is he in terms of getting to the third receiver, that maturation in year three? &gt;&gt; jon: i think hes improving you can see that particularly on third down, where his completion percentage is much higher look, hes not perfect but by keeping offensive coordinator mike shula here and keeping him in the same system, youll continue to see progress in every aspect of his game &gt;&gt; mike: third and seven, <person player="nate ebner" race="white" position="DB">nate ebner</person> again in <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">newton</person> is chased got away from ninkovich, dancing, there goes cam, add this to the highlight reel &gt;&gt; jon: that might be the greatest play ive seen <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">cam newton</person> make in a long time this is the national football league and he makes four new england patriots miss third down and seven he drops back to pass nobody is open he makes one patriot miss he makes two patriots miss theres jones, thats three and he takes off and has enough energy to get the first down thats why i drive my car home at night with memories or nightmares of <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">cam newton</person> thats unbelievable &gt;&gt;

jon: in the patriots huddle, undrafted rookie from maryland <person player="chris jones" race="nonwhite" position="DT">chris jones</person>, number 94, another undrafted rookie from bowling <person player="justin green" race="UNK" position="DB">green</person> these are two defensive tackles that play multiple positions, that are filling in for <person player="vince wilfork" race="nonwhite" position="DT">vince wilfork</person>, <person player="tommy kelly" race="nonwhite" position="DT">tommy kelly</person> they play hard might not be the most talented patriots, but they are versatile, they play hard &gt;&gt; mike: rookie <person player="logan ryan" race="nonwhite" position="DB">logan ryan</person> in there, the injury to arrington, run up the middle to williams close to a first down &gt;&gt; jon: these panthers have gimmick runs &gt;&gt; mike: they take advantage of what is missing up the middle, <person player="vince wilfork" race="nonwhite" position="DT">wilfork</person> and <person player="tommy kelly" race="nonwhite" position="DT">kelly</person> <person player="vince wilfork" race="nonwhite" position="DT">wilfork</person> went out, the yards allowed by the defense for the patriots rushing has gone up by about 42 yards, mayo, <person player="steve gregory" race="white" position="DB">gregory</person> out tonight, and denard, five guys who started for belichick not here tonight &gt;&gt; jon: this is where carolina is dangerous in <person player="kawann short" race="nonwhite" position="DT">short</person> yardage, <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">cam newton</person> as a runner against this loaded box &gt;&gt; mike: they go heavy to the right run that way with <person player="mike tolbert" race="nonwhite" position="RB">mike tolbert</person>, the bowling ball is bouncing and gets the first down kevin <person player="devin mccourty" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mccourty</person> could have stopped the other backs, but <person player="mike tolbert" race="nonwhite" position="RB">tolbert</person> who is listed at 245, and hell chuckle when you mention that weight to him makes the play &gt;&gt; jon: look at this, uses the stiff arm, knows where he needs to get to the first down and <person player="mike tolbert" race="nonwhite" position="RB">mike tolbert</person> is very effective in goal line and <person player="kawann short" race="nonwhite" position="DT">short</person> yardage situations, he just earned his money there great play by the veteran &gt;&gt; mike: put a lot of money into this backfield, tolbert, stewart, <person player="deangelo williams" race="nonwhite" position="RB">deangelo williams</person> back there now first down play action pass looking deep hell take off good hustle by chancellor jones to limit the gain only about a half yard &gt;&gt; jon: outside of <person player="chandler jones" race="nonwhite" position="DE">chandler jones</person>, i dont know how many patriots can run down <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">cam newton</person> i bet if you stood cam i bet if you stood jones and <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">newton</person> next to each other, they are probably the same size &gt;&gt; mike: same height, 65" jones is listed at 265 cam not too far away from that tremendous athletes <person player="vince wilfork" race="nonwhite" position="DT">vince wilfork</person> just a rock in the middle of the new england defense for so many years can only sit and watch after his season ending injury second and nine <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">newton</person> complete back to <person player="steve smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">steve smith</person> he ask <person player="aqib talib" race="nonwhite" position="DB">talib</person> meet again first down, carolina &gt;&gt; jon: thats a one on one confrontation that <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">newton</person> couldnt wait to get back to one on one coverage for <person player="steve smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">steve smith</person>, who does an excellent job to use his hands to beat <person player="aqib talib" race="nonwhite" position="DB">aqib talib</person> so far <person player="steve smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">steve smith</person> has done a great job against <person player="aqib talib" race="nonwhite" position="DB">talib</person> tonight &gt;&gt; mike: 16 on that one 62 yards on the night for smith most of them matched up with talib, who returns after missing the last three games, he had that hip quad area against new orleans <person player="jonathan stewart" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jonathan stewart</person> the runningback running right and good penetration by the new england defense and <person player="rob ninkovich" race="UNK" position="DE">rob ninkovich</person> makes it no gain &gt;&gt; jon: talk about an outside linebacker setting the edge in a 34 defense <person player="rob ninkovich" race="UNK" position="DE">rob ninkovich</person> does an excellent job of that but i like what carolina has done, <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">cam newton</person> has obviously kept this drive alive with a great scramble but you have to answer a score with a score of your own to play championship football see if carolina can answer &gt;&gt; mike: they spread it out of the shotgun from the 21 looking for <person player="greg olsen" race="white" position="TE">olsen</person> <person player="brandon lafell" race="nonwhite" position="WR">lafell</person> to the 15 setting up third and four &gt;&gt; jon: <person player="greg olsen" race="white" position="TE">greg olsen</person> runs a clear out route and cam does a nice job getting to his outlet receiver <person player="brandon lafell" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brandon lafell</person>, who scored earlier in the red zone &gt;&gt; mike: <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">cam newton</person>, six for six on this drive one thing they have done well is be an effective third down team not just the running look at the passer rating that says a lot &gt;&gt; jon: i think a lot has to do with carolina staying in third down and medium situations once again, a bunch formation at the bottom of the screen they love <person player="steve smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">steve smith</person> &gt;&gt; mike: a lot of back up corners for the patriots, <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">newton</person> fires, end zone touchdown to the tight end, <person player="greg olsen" race="white" position="TE">greg olsen</person> &gt;&gt; jon: a lot of weapons in carolina and <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">cam newton</person> is getting better and better at using all of them &gt;&gt; mike: hell deliver another football &gt;&gt; jon: just a corner route by olsen, against mccourty, the ball thrown on time and perfectly touchdown, carolina <person player="greg olsen" race="white" position="TE">olsen</person> <person player="mike tolbert" race="nonwhite" position="RB">tolbert</person> in <person player="kawann short" race="nonwhite" position="DT">short</person> yardage and an array of different runners, array of different receivers, and <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">cam newton</person> hurt new england with his legs himself &gt;&gt; mike: ready for confirmation, maintained control throughout touchdown confirmed by the replay booth <person player="graham gano" race="white" position="K">graham gano</person> patriots score to tie the game at 10, <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">newton</person> comes right back out, seven for seven, they march 81 yards down the field a highlight scramble by cam kept it going a touchdown toss to <person player="greg olsen" race="white" position="TE">olsen</person> gives the panthers t &gt;&gt; mike: on the touchdown drive, the <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">newton</person> passing numbers, when you go back and look, youll see <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">cam newton</person> had a 14 yard run on third down you needed to see it to understand it &gt;&gt; jon: 14 yard run made about five new england patriots miss there is three, four, he gains 14 yards, but he ran over 60, actually 75 yards he ran to get a 14 yard gain unbelievable play on third and seven to keep the drive alive but using <person player="steve smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">steve smith</person>, using <person player="brandon lafell" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brandon lafell</person> losing all of this receivers, capping it off with his tight end, <person player="greg olsen" race="white" position="TE">greg olsen</person>, its a hard offense to stop with <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">newton</person> as the trigger &gt;&gt; mike: <person player="graham gano" race="white" position="K">gano</person> kicking and <person player="josh boyce" race="UNK" position="WR">boyce</person> will take a knee another touch back off the leg of <person player="graham gano" race="white" position="K">graham gano</person> its not the way <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> does it but hes finding a way to be very &gt;&gt; mike: on this breezy night in charlotte, aerial coverage brought to you by directv they asked the fans to wear black, its hard to tell from the aerial shot, but the place is packed its jumping and good football on this monday night two drives in the quarter each team has scored a touchdown bradys turn from the 20 tom to <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> gain of just two yards lisa salters, what about the injury to the outstanding defensive end, <person player="charles johnson" race="UNK" position="DE">charles johnson</person> &gt;&gt; lisa: <person player="charles johnson" race="UNK" position="DE">johnson</person> isnt on the field right now he is on the sidelines, looks like hes trying to stay loose, trying to warm up im told he will go back in the game his snaps will be limited but he will return to the game &gt;&gt; mike: thats encouraging after that leg whip from <person player="marcus cannon" race="nonwhite" position="OG">cannon</person> who was beaten on the opening drive in the quarter a run to the right and <person player="stevan ridley" race="nonwhite" position="RB">stevan ridley</person> fumbled in the first half, back in here protecting, as he got a gain of six yards &gt;&gt; jon: bill belichick came back to his veteran half back the panthers defense is number one in the nfl this is where you earn your number one status against a great quarterback late in games &gt;&gt; mike: on third and two, <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> completes to <person player="shane vereen" race="UNK" position="RB">vereen</person> <person player="shane vereen" race="UNK" position="RB">shane vereen</person> out of the backfield to the 35 yard line and a first down &gt;&gt; jon: <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> is like a computer he looks left, looks left, and he checks the ball down to <person player="shane vereen" race="UNK" position="RB">shane vereen</person> and thats just a great job by brady, looking off <person player="thomas davis" race="nonwhite" position="DB">thomas davis</person> when you play this tampa two or carolina two coverage, you know you have two defenders reading your eyes, you have to look them off, nobody does it like tom braid eve &gt;&gt; mike: multiple tight end look, power to the right, following it is <person player="stevan ridley" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ridley</person> and hes to the 40 yard line and a gain of five will bring this quarter to an end patriots havent gone with much of their up tempo stuff tonight what did cam and <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> do in the third quarter? no incompletion, two full drives, one touchdown, another touchdown and now <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> trying to bring the patriots back the panthers by seven after three on monday &gt;&gt; mike: <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> and <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">newton</person> tonight, three incompletions for <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> its been a struggle of completion percentage, tom has not completed 70% of his passes in the last 20 games he has played in the regular season 2124, high percentage tonight <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">newton</person> doing it with his multipurpose game seven points panther lead <person player="shane vereen" race="UNK" position="RB">vereen</person> is the back from the 40 bradys pass complete for the first down, <person player="aaron dobson" race="UNK" position="WR">aaron dobson</person> out to midfield into panther territory &gt;&gt; jon: if you dont get to brady, hell look you off and shred this tampa two coverage he recognizes it is cover two watch him look away to his left and then throw back to his right thats how you attack the tampa two coverage if you dont get pressure from the front four, he will stretch you &gt;&gt; mike: here comes <person player="stevan ridley" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ridley</person> up the middle and falling forward, hard, tough running like a determined guy that was benched in the second after a fumble &gt;&gt;

jon: last week carolina beating san francisco winning a tight football game important for the confidence of <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">cam newton</person> and this young outfit these are the critical moments that franchise quarterbacks come through over the top, <person player="steve smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">steve smith</person> was the intended receiver &gt;&gt; jon: i think cam missed that throw its a play action pass, <person player="steve smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">steve smith</person> comes into your screen on the right side, ball is thrown behind <person player="steve smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">steve smith</person>s, critical miss by <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">cam newton</person> in the second half the carolina offense has been at the same productivity three and out last drive third and six here and away from their power run game setting up their passes 21, pocket collapsing, <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">newton</person> has room out of bounds at the 36 &gt;&gt; jon: you play that coverage against this quarterback, its two deep, man to man underneath nobody is open, and <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">cam newton</person> puts it down and runs for a first down thats the third time <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">newton</person> has gotten out of trouble and run for a big first down really a hard quarterback to play man to man coverage against, because of his ability to run &gt;&gt; mike: needed six, got 15 approaching the 5:00 mark drives are running out run by <person player="deangelo williams" race="nonwhite" position="RB">deangelo williams</person>, that is stuffed by <person player="brandon spikes" race="nonwhite" position="LB">brandon spikes</person> you alluded to it earlier, jon, <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">newton</person> is trying to make a fourth quarter comeback since cam has been around, this team has not been able to win the close games, there have been defensive breakdowns last year, you were talking about, they didnt close the deal with a late drive &gt;&gt; jon: thats what these fans are waiting to see &gt;&gt; mike: second and nine <person player="deangelo williams" race="nonwhite" position="RB">deangelo williams</person> catches it and its third and <person player="kawann short" race="nonwhite" position="DT">short</person> &gt;&gt; mike: all time leading rusher in panther history catches the ball and does an excellent job on the sideline against <person player="chandler jones" race="nonwhite" position="DE">chandler jones</person>, fighting for a first down and these are the <person player="kawann short" race="nonwhite" position="DT">short</person> yardage situations, where you have to really be careful, with <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">cam newton</person> he loves to come out of these play action situations and run the ball himself &gt;&gt; mike: panthers spread jones runs off late third and two designed run <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">newton</person> going to get there and thats the 65", 250 &gt;&gt; jon: <person player="deangelo williams" race="nonwhite" position="RB">deangelo williams</person>, <person player="mike tolbert" race="nonwhite" position="RB">mike tolbert</person>, <person player="jonathan stewart" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jonathan stewart</person>, millions of dollars invested in your runningbacks and youre going to use <person player="greg olsen" race="white" position="TE">greg olsen</person> and <person player="mike tolbert" race="nonwhite" position="RB">tolbert</person> as the lead blockers, and youre going to run <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">cam newton</person> on a power play or a counter play unbelievable &gt;&gt; mike: other runningbacks have run for 34 yards tonight, cam has 62 &gt;&gt; jon: he led them in rushing last year &gt;&gt; mike: 3:00 left pressure picked up <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">newton</person> high throw, brought in by the tight end <person player="greg olsen" race="white" position="TE">olsen</person> into patriots territory out of bounds at the 39 15 yards and a first down &gt;&gt; jon: great job by <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">newton</person> to get to his secondary receiver you asked about that earlier in the game they have a slot combination, they want to throw the deep square in to <person player="steve smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">steve smith</person> <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">cam newton</person> found his secondary receiver nice work by the third year quarterback &gt;&gt; mike: <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> and mcdaniels on the other side looking over what they have will it be come from behind or a tie game 2:49 to go <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">newton</person> looking long, comes underneath, missed ted ginn on that first down throw accuracy on the <person player="kawann short" race="nonwhite" position="DT">short</person> throws at times still a spot <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">newton</person> could improve on &gt;&gt; jon: they are trying hard to get the ball downfield to <person player="steve smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">steve smith</person> <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">newton</person> has plenty of time, gets off it, comes underneath, he misses an underneath receiver and they have to get this ball, i think, mike, inside the 30, with this wind to give <person player="graham gano" race="white" position="K">gano</person> a reasonable chance for a tying field goal &gt;&gt; mike: he can make a 55 yarder, but the wind going this way, jon, youre right 2:45, <person player="mike tolbert" race="nonwhite" position="RB">mike tolbert</person> punishing run up the middle, <person player="donta hightower" race="UNK" position="LB">hightower</person> waiting for him here comes another big third down &gt;&gt; jon: <person player="graham gano" race="white" position="K">graham gano</person> made a kick last week to beat the 49ers, all five field goals over 50 hes made, mike &gt;&gt; mike: the key point is the wind its swirling a little bit four downs? &gt;&gt; jon: i think riverboat ron is thinking about it hes gone for fourth down this year &gt;&gt; mike: wind has been worse tonight third and seven needing to get to the 29, the pats bring pressure, <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">newton</person> throws flag, <person player="devin mccourty" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mccourty</person> covering <person player="greg olsen" race="white" position="TE">olsen</person> &gt;&gt; jon: huge penalty &gt;&gt; referee: prior to the pass, holding, defense, number 32, five yard penalty automatic first down &gt;&gt; jon: watch olsen, hell release and throw his arms up in the air thats about as much holding as you can have good call by the officials a huge penalty against <person player="devin mccourty" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mccourty</person> &gt;&gt; mike: last play before the 2:00 warning from the 31 here is <person player="mike tolbert" race="nonwhite" position="RB">mike tolbert</person>, ahead for three 2:00 warning at 1:57 can <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">newton</person> get it in the end zone for the lead or will &gt;&gt;&gt; stuart <person player="chris scott" race="UNK" position="OG">scott</person> culling up after the game with post game report, highlights and analysis as the pantingers and patriots scrap late also issues with the <person player="leon washington" race="nonwhite" position="RB">washington</person> redskins, monday night football next week and the top ten plays of the week in the nfl all that and more coming up on sportscenter, mike &gt;&gt; mike: thank you steve rung, ray lewis here guys back in the studio long possessions both ways in the second half only 13 total possessions in the game one of them a quick two play possession at the end of the half bill belichick didnt use his timeouts after the sack belichick will think about using timeouts here to preserve clock for <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> &gt;&gt; jon: no question &gt;&gt; mike: 1:57 left, second and six, <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">cam newton</person> and the panthers at the 28 newtons throw to olsen, the tight end, first down inside the 20 yard line &gt;&gt; jon: all three of the top corners for new england are out of the game and there is <person player="greg olsen" race="white" position="TE">olsen</person> on a simple flat pattern setting up <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">cam newton</person> with another first down marquise cole is in the game, number 23, and <person player="kyle arrington" race="nonwhite" position="DB">arrington</person> at the bottom of the screen &gt;&gt; mike: three receivers, <person player="greg olsen" race="white" position="TE">olsen</person> the tight end and <person player="deangelo williams" race="nonwhite" position="RB">deangelo williams</person> and false start on care line a &gt;&gt; referee: false start, offense, five yard penalty, still first down &gt;&gt; mike: there is no ten second runoff there 1:16 now as the clock is stopped &gt;&gt; mike: <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">newton</person> throws incomplete incompletion stops it at 1:09 &gt;&gt; jon: i think with new england, out of corners, i think they are reluctant to blitz and play man to man coverage against these panther receivers so youre seeing bill belichick and his defensive coaching staff play zone coverage and let carolina kick a field goal there is no guarantee in this wind, that <person player="graham gano" race="white" position="K">graham gano</person> can tie the game, and overtime with <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> is not the worst case scenario for the patriots zone coverage again &gt;&gt; mike: with the wind, a sack would be really big here four man pass rush, <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">newton</person> firing, it is caught on the run ginn inside the 10, ted ginn, carolina, touchdown &gt;&gt; jon: ted ginn came to carolina because he wanted to play wide receiver, <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">cam newton</person> says well give you a shot, <person player="kyle arrington" race="nonwhite" position="DB">arrington</person> misses a tackle, if you miss ted ginn, hes gone, what a great drive by <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">cam newton</person> and the panthers offense guess what? these panthers fans wanted to see this from their youngs quarterback &gt;&gt; mike: first catch of the night for ginn touchdown confirmed upstairs four point lead if the kick is good, which would force <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> and the patriots to score a touchdown 59 seconds, and <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> has to bring the patriots back and theres that &gt;&gt; mike: one of the better complete games against a quality team weve seen for <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">cam newton</person>, those numbers, heres the touchdown to ted ginn &gt;&gt; jon: they want to throw a seam route to lafell, hes not there he gets to his secondary receiver ted ginn at the top of the screen, good firm accurate throw and <person player="kyle arrington" race="nonwhite" position="DB">arrington</person> misses the tackle the injuries in the patriots secondary, the injuries to their defensive tackles dont forget mayo, their best linebacker, are these injuries too much for even the great bill belichick to overcome? &gt;&gt; mike: theres a lot of touch backs, this is a kickoff into the wind <person player="josh boyce" race="UNK" position="WR">josh boyce</person> who has been returned kickoffs before has been taking them tonight good hang time and no return for <person player="matthew mulligan" race="white" position="TE">matthew</person> <person player="matt slater" race="UNK" position="WR">slater</person> here comes <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> down four 59 seconds left hes done this plenty of times &gt;&gt; jon: did it to the saints &gt;&gt; mike: it looked like that game was over twice <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> with just absolute perfect throws look how covered <person player="kenbrell thompkins" race="UNK" position="WR">thompkins</person> was, the game winner for new england &gt;&gt; jon: youll see cover two, i believe from these panthers theyre going to disguise, but they have to reroute the receivers and keep the ball in the field of play full complement of timeouts, pressure, bradys pass is incomplete for edelman, 55 seconds left panthers and patriots rarely meet panthers fans remember <person player="jake bequette" race="UNK" position="DE">jake</person> delhommes touchdown and <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> marched them down the field and they kicked a late field goal four man rush, <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> throws incomplete and the man who was hurt in the third quarter, johnson, joining with edwards to flush <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> &gt;&gt; jon: little delay and he punishes <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> third down and ten your coverage is going to be a two deep zone i believe they will funnel everything inside and try to cut loose the pass rush &gt;&gt; mike: <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> hit as he throws, incomplete it was <person player="greg hardy" race="nonwhite" position="DE">hardy</person> and edwards who met at the quarterback and the patriots are down to one play &gt;&gt; jon: this is the 15th round youve got to go after the knock joust you must get to the quarterback edwards, 92 addison, 97 &gt;&gt; mike: <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> completed 13 in a row hes missed his last four they are on their feet the joint is jumping the game is on the line on this play &gt;&gt; jon: they will play the same coverage and rush the same four new england has to pass protect better &gt;&gt; mike: bradys throw, down the middle, gronkowski, first down timeout new england 40 seconds left &gt;&gt; jon: how tough is <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person>? &gt;&gt; mik &gt;&gt; mike: fourth and ten, <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> to <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> for 23 keeps the game going &gt;&gt; jon: carolina play twoes deep this time they play two deep man to man and <person player="luke kuechly" race="white" position="LB">kuechly</person> against <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> and <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> beats <person player="luke kuechly" race="white" position="LB">kuechly</person> for a huge play to keep new england alive in the game surprised carolina played man to man underneath <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> appreciated it &gt;&gt; mike: two timeouts left, new england from the 43 <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> fires right, incomplete for <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> blanketed 35 seconds left a lot of field to cover &gt;&gt; jon: same coverage they just ran two deep man to man underneath <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> beat <person player="luke kuechly" race="white" position="LB">kuechly</person> that time <person player="thomas davis" race="nonwhite" position="DB">thomas davis</person>, whos had three acl injuries does an excellent job in one on one coverage &gt;&gt; mike: <person player="greg hardy" race="nonwhite" position="DE">hardy</person> on the left pressure bradys pass is caught in the middle of the field timeout taken <person player="danny amendola" race="white" position="WR">amendola</person> looks like he has the first down at the panther 46 one timeout 29 seconds left &gt;&gt; mike: belichicks team trying to get to 82, riveras team, won at san francisco, how about beating the niners and patriots back to back weeks to show that your team is for real? one timeout left, 29 seconds over the middle off the hands, off another hand, and incomplete &gt;&gt; jon: credit to carolina, they have blitzed and played two deep zone, two deep man that time three deep zone plenty of time left &gt;&gt; mike: <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> throwing on the wheel route, vereen, couldnt bring it in <person player="luke kuechly" race="white" position="LB">kuechly</person> who has been all over the field all night long step for step its third down &gt;&gt; jon: thats the play they were saving they knew the panthers were in two deep man to man underneath and they wanted <person player="shane vereen" race="UNK" position="RB">shane vereen</person> one on one with <person player="luke kuechly" race="white" position="LB">kuechly</person> and they got the coverage but the pass rush again gets to <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person>, but i think <person player="shane vereen" race="UNK" position="RB">vereen</person> needs to make that play what a throw by <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> &gt;&gt; mike: just coming back from the broken hand which is more taped on the right than the left <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> incomplete <person player="aaron dobson" race="UNK" position="WR">dobson</person> tackled by white so it will be at the 36 yard line with 12 seconds and a timeout left &gt;&gt; jon: no question about the penalty &gt;&gt; mike: the carolina sideline trying to sell uncatchable &gt;&gt; referee: pass interference, defense, ball will be placed at the spot of the foul automatic first down &gt;&gt; mike: it looked like the right call &gt;&gt; jon: second time he had his hands all over <person player="aaron dobson" race="UNK" position="WR">dobson</person> thats a perfect call back to the game here, 12 seconds left <person player="aaron dobson" race="UNK" position="WR">dobson</person> at the bottom of the screen against a rookie whos had problems tonight &gt;&gt; mike: that one timeout <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> hit as he throws, caught, <person player="shane vereen" race="UNK" position="RB">vereen</person> goes down timeout quickly taken here with five seconds left the patriots have one shot from the 25 barring a defensive foul &gt;&gt; jon: almost the same situation they had a few weeks ago against the saints when <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> threw the four vertical to <person player="kenbrell thompkins" race="UNK" position="WR">thompkins</person> for a dramatic victory but &gt;&gt; mike: clock down to four one more tick &gt;&gt; jon: the ball has to be thrown obviously into the end zone it will be interesting to see what carolina does they have to get reroutes on the outside these patriot receivers have done a nice job &gt;&gt; referee: six seconds on the game clock &gt;&gt; mike: sx seconds left still because you have to go from the end zone, its hard to get two plays in in six seconds &gt;&gt; jon: out of the timeout, this should give hardy, number 76, <person player="charles johnson" race="UNK" position="DE">charles johnson</person> some rest to give new england their best pass rush of the night &gt;&gt; mike: six seconds remaining, timeout carolina so ron rivera got a look and wants to talk about how to defend that look and the question on new englands side, do you go change your play at all at this point, after they have gotten a look at where you want to line up? &gt;&gt; jon: theres a good chance you change it <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> probably has three or four plays for this situation these are the situations, that you practice over and over in training camp, desperation, hail mary s at midfield you have a couple different plays at your disposal they have a big receiver in dobson, that they isolate and if the coverage gets that way, the 65" <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> can make a catch &gt;&gt; mike: <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">edelman</person> and <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> to the top dob ton, <person player="danny amendola" race="white" position="WR">amendola</person> to the bottom six seconds left a quick shot to get closer and out of bounds with <person player="aaron dobson" race="UNK" position="WR">dobson</person> to give the patriots a shot from the 18 yard line &gt;&gt; jon: i dont know how many times i have seen <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> put the ball in tight windows, where you cant explain it what theyre looking for a magical pinpoint bullet from <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> &gt;&gt; mike: heres the final play <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> sets up throws end zone intercepted flag in the end zone hang on &gt;&gt; jon: they interfered with <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> &gt;&gt; mike: they carried him out the back line so the celebration put on hold here in charlotte now the panthers celebrating &gt;&gt; referee: the game is over &gt;&gt; mike: no foul game over and the panthers with the win interesting end to that one well get a lot of looks at it <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> wants an explanation tom is furious if you threw a flag there, how do you pick it up? and <person player="ryan mallett" race="white" position="QB">ryan mallett</person> continues the conversation our official in the booth is here, jerry, what do you see there? &gt;&gt; the contact appears deep near the end line but the ball is intercepted underneath therefore, that takes that off there is no chance for this receiver to catch the ball therefore, theres no foul &gt;&gt; mike: so in that conference, thats what they would discuss &gt;&gt; thats correct &gt;&gt; mike: you think thats a correct call? &gt;&gt; i do &gt;&gt; mike: interesting &gt;&gt; jon: i see the linebacker with his arms all over the tight end no wonder he cant make a play on the ball &gt;&gt; mike: dont know if he would have gotten there, because of what jerry said in any case, its a carolina win both teams are 73 lisa salters is with <person player="cam newton" race="nonwhite" position="QB">cam newton</person> &gt;&gt; lisa: cam, you told us before the game, you felt like you were living the dream going up against <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> tonight what does this win over the patriots mean to you? &gt;&gt; i dont think i got any more nails, i was biting them all night we knew we would have this type of game the defense stood up at the end offensively we answered the bell each time we had opportunities to and it was a great atmosphere to be around &gt;&gt; lisa: the game winning touchdown pass to ted ginn, what was the call &gt;&gt; we had a matchup that we liked usually when we get defenders up on ginn, we knew they like to play off, i wanted to get ted an opportunity to make a play he did and he did the rest &gt;&gt; lisa: i saw you on the sideline while <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> was on the field in those final seconds you seemed calm but what was going through your mind? &gt;&gt; looks are deceiving all in all, my hat goes off to the patriots they are a hell of a team <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> is a legendary quarterback and you know, we just had an unbelievable night tonight in boa &gt;&gt;
