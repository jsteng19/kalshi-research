the 40s feels a little bit cooler and terry <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">collins</person> and the tennessee office could get the ball first as the titans won the toss and will receive the <person player="dwight freeney" race="nonwhite" position="DE">dwight freeney</person> the perennial footballer will be put the pressure on the quarterback to begin with tony jun jun jie s team three and three as you see if tennessee wins one advantage theyd be four up on the entire division through seven games list im wearing an overcoat here chris youre soft freezing <person player="adam vinatieri" race="white" position="K">adam vinatieri</person> kicks off to <person player="chris carr" race="white" position="DB">chris carr</person> off we go from nashville the former raider car as the eggs on the outside a nice return to get us going to the 42 yard line but return by car to get it started one of his teammates shaken up after that 41 yard pick returned to get us started so came off to a immediate halt here as <person player="jeff saturday" race="white" position="C">jeff</person> fisher comes out to check a a very important player <person player="dave ball" race="white" position="DE">dave ball</person> who is scheduled to start tonight for kyle vandenbosch at defensive end vandenbosch couple of times to the pro bowl has a groin injury so he is out tonight ball was going to start for him at defensive end but hurt here right in the middle of your screen and the 98 taken on the block there from darrow read the defensive tackle for the colts there is a good look at kyle vandenbosch such a good player on this team when to the pro bowl last year for years there is ona told us if im not a hundred percent i cant go because i only know how to play 100 percent then we talk about ruining that groin for the entire season it s a little bit what he did last week thought he could go played three snaps and once he started a fire it just didnt feel right yeah the defensive ends on this tennessee defense are very important they like to play outside as coach liked to call that wide nine or hard nine outside and funnel everything back into the inside of why not when you have an <person player="albert haynesworth" race="nonwhite" position="DT">albert haynesworth</person> and a <person player="tony brown" race="nonwhite" position="DE">tony brown</person> two dominant football players those tackle positions youll like the funnel it back to the inside you dont have noticed i mean and i dont mean to disparage any other coaches in the league but whenever somebody in tennessee gets hurt <person player="jeff saturday" race="white" position="C">jeff</person> fisher is out there he s out there right away i dont know that all coaches do that <person player="jeff saturday" race="white" position="C">jeff</person> fisher does that maybe one of the reasons that players like to play for him so much because they feel he cares well i think every coach of the national football team up here runs out to the field and that s noticeable he does more than other coaches he does right whatever remember his comfort zone he s with it so balls certainly groggy as he s brought back and that will impact the titans once <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton manning</person> and the colts get the ball but for now after the good kickoff return it belongs to carrie <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">collins</person> has been doing this for a while youre 14 the league is 35 years old had a bunch of stops around the league since being drafted fifth overall by carolina in 95 <person player="chris johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris johnson</person> starts as the vacuum and his first carry man with four to speed gets out to the 49 yard line so youll see <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">collins</person> and <person player="lendale white" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lendale white</person> none of the what you say jaws smash and dash is national labeling them around here in tennessee they get their wide receivers back just in mccarran s and just engaged missed last week with injury their tight ends big in their passing game yeah they really are key they feature the tight ends i mean these guys are athletic theyre good pass receivers both gave and algae <person player="alge crumpler" race="nonwhite" position="TE">crumpler</person> solid at the tight end position and you see a lot of them on the field together in one back as you do for this snap and looking at <person player="bo scaife" race="UNK" position="TE">scaife</person> his college but he was covered and carry just throws it away incomplete got excellent job by <person player="tim jennings" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tim jennings</person> the corner read the bootleg and did a nice job of getting deep on scape ok this indy defense people have run on them they are small up front jaws and that s been a known quantity for a while here mike they averaged 265 pounds on the defensive line that s 40 pounds less per man than the titans offensive line but they do a slanting stuns twist all those things to compensate for their lack of bulk in the back end <person player="kelvin hayden" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kelvin hayden</person> corner back out <person player="tim jennings" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tim jennings</person> starts for him and <person player="melvin bullitt" race="UNK" position="DB">melvin</person> bullet is starting for the defensive player of the year <person player="bob sanders" race="nonwhite" position="DB">bob sanders</person> hopes to be back next week third and five and <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">collins</person> pass complete to <person player="brandon jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brandon jones</person> his 12 catch of the year at a first down into colts territory the 45 yard line really nice job of the receivers working upfield <person player="brandon jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brandon jones</person> knowing how far he has to go to the first down she kari steps up nicely in the pocket and he can still stroke it you always have to check to make sure it s a wide receiver who actually caught the ball because it happens so infrequently with this team theyre receiving the wide receive as he goes to tight ends did you say in the backs rarely to wide receivers 34th grabbed by a wide receiver thus far this year and on the run here comes johnson able to drag the wouldbe tackler marlon <person player="marlin jackson" race="UNK" position="DB">jackson</person> down at a good gain of about seven yards for <person player="chris johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris johnson</person> we mentioned <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">kerry collins</person> drafted by the carolina panthers bill polian was the gm took them out of penn state where a terrific run for joe paterno 22 and 2 and there is success as the panthers from getting going as an expansion team then to new orleans where the many troubles off the field began including about with alcoholism that it really righted the ship with the giants taking them to the super bowl struggled in oakland but so is everyone as late comes to tennessee is a backup and has emerged as a significant piece of his titans team starting for the injured <person player="vince young" race="nonwhite" position="QB">vince young</person> since week two runs pass complete for the first down to just engage the at the 32yard line good opening drive tennyson <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">kerry</person> calm is a very efficient quarterback you know he s not gonna stop at drop back there try to throw the ball 40 times deep post long balls they want to sustain offense run the ball mix in the playaction pass a game and play the strength of their football team the running game in the defense under the snap of 15year veteran kevin mawatha center a first down throw complete to post escapes the tight end couple yard shy of the first end the very nice mix here of the run in the past with <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">collins</person> well with that pass attempt he is tied with joe montana 10th on the alltime list there s been a lot of history along the way accumulating these numbers i mean congratulations to him but you dont usually hear his name in the same sentence is joe montana s you notes <person player="lavelle hawkins" race="UNK" position="WR">lavelle hawkins</person> the rookie at a cal in motion at the top and johnson left side pretty key aho waiting form and the line of scrimmage being controlled by tennessee early on so as long as youre here let me bring you in on something thank you terry <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">collins</person> told us a couple of days ago he felt he was 95% of what he was 95 percent on the number of living high probably a little bit high you know watch him carry watching his number games this season watch them to practice over the weekend now he can still throw it now but i would say he s probably closer to 85 because when he was at a hundred percent i remember those years with the giants he could throw the ball with anyone the age has caught up a little bit with him <person player="chris johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris johnson</person> has a wide receiver josh you talked about the bottom of the screen they go the other way to just engaged couldnt hang on just a half step away from a completion their whole lives second down yeah im like when you look at <person player="chris johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris johnson</person> you see the speed you already mentioned the 424 there were some scouts had told me told me they had him at 418 in the 40yard dash which is amazing speed he does have good hands he plays in there nickle situations in the backfield we expected eventually to see him line up as a wide receiver we saw at the last play second and ten second straight throw this is to johnson trying to use the speed but indianapolis has speed on defense their captain <person player="gary brackett" race="nonwhite" position="LB">gary</person> bracket fourth year as a starter made the tackle were talking a lot about <person player="chris johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris johnson</person> out of east carolina 24th overall selection ran for nearly three thousand yards in college you see he is a brought those good numbers to the nfl in part because the speed is translated he didnt know if that four to speed he talked about would be the same in the nfl but he s found himself able to pull away from guys when in the open field he like adrian peterson that great speed on the edge change of the angles of which you attack a ball carrier glenn down the line in next to <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">collins</person> on third and a pressure picked up for the moment passed his punt by scape but itll be shy of the first down the guy throwing it for <person player="bob sanders" race="nonwhite" position="DB">bob sanders</person> <person player="melvin bullitt" race="UNK" position="DB">melvin bullitt</person> able to get

position="DB">bob sanders</person> he was a defensive player of the year a year ago but <person player="melvin bullitt" race="UNK" position="DB">melvin</person> bullet has played very well in <person player="bob sanders" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sanders</person> absent he closed nicely on scape there made the tackle short of the first down <person player="rob bironas" race="white" position="K">rob bironas</person> has made 18 consecutive field goals a couple away from al del greco has not missed a kick this season all ten field goals all 17 extra points and from 34 yards first

yard line where the titans will take over how can you resist saying check please gar song if you knew i was gonna say it youre laughing i said tonight s game also available in spanish on espn deportes just a little bit away from downtown you can actually take a little stroll across the bridge here to lp field and <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton manning</person> the colts take over at their own 31 in the fans know to make as much noise as possible to make communication tough to the pulse of the line dominika roads the runningback whole and not gonna gain much the

injury report on ball at the wind knocked out of them when they kickoff return his return is questionable the colts take thee john <person player="gijon robinson" race="UNK" position="TE">robinson</person> out is when <person player="anthony gonzalez" race="UNK" position="WR">anthony</person> gonzales in to go to the threewide set this is a manageable situation to fait man he likes to stay in that third in five or less so he has all his weapons at his disposal doesnt have to take that deep drop if you take that quick drop and get the ball out of his hands <person player="reggie wayne" race="nonwhite" position="WR">wayne</person> came in motion and the pass is just it up by courtland <person player="cortland finnegan" race="nonwhite" position="DB">finnegan</person> intended for <person player="reggie wayne" race="nonwhite" position="WR">reggie</person> rather his been fired vixens <person player="vincent fuller" race="nonwhite"

player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton</person> died him down vinson <person player="vincent fuller" race="nonwhite" position="DB">fuller</person> did a terrific job because he had <person player="reggie wayne" race="nonwhite" position="WR">reggie wayne</person> on the deep cross that s a staple of the colts offense this has been missing buzz <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton</person> is not in time to let this play develop here he had time you can see <person player="reggie wayne" race="nonwhite" position="WR">wayne</person> has one on

national football league not just by their peers but by their players tony dungy super bowl champion <person player="jeff saturday" race="white" position="C">jeff</person> fischer has been in his job as long as longer than any nfl head coach currently working right now <person player="chris johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris johnson</person> s the bank drives start at their own nine and great penetration by <person player="clint session" race="nonwhite" position="LB">clint session</person> and they didnt rule that johnson s knee comes down so it will be a loss of yards when you watch the colts over the last couple of weeks you see a lot of 55 secondyear man out of pittsburgh he s a guy that flashes wed like to say and in this defense it is about penetration they will never take on an offensive lineman or a tight end mantoman they will slant they will stunt they will twist they will try to get penetration in the backfield clinch <person player="clint session" race="nonwhite" position="LB">session</person> did there he blew that play up it s all about getting into the backfield for this front seven of the indianapolis colts some of those <person player="vince young" race="nonwhite" position="QB">young</person> players on the coaches come to the <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton manning</person> era coats all they know is winning and three and three is something new for them to deal with johnson meharry gets to the 10yard line third and long coming flag down mike carey our referee tonight oh baby number 68 decline tear down on kevin malaya the veterans center now this is amazing right here when you look at the offensive line of the titans average 305 40 pounds heavier per man on the colts of defensive line that s why the colts cant take you on mantoman they have to use those slants and stumps and get that penetration they go man on man theyll get knocked off the football titans no three receivers with oh <person player="lavelle hawkins" race="UNK" position="WR">hawkins</person> justin mccarran s <person player="brandon jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brandon jones</person> oh run it with <person player="chris johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris johnson</person> and that speed and not getting away from <person player="gary brackett" race="nonwhite" position="LB">gary brackett</person> marlon <person player="marlin jackson" race="UNK" position="DB">jackson</person> off the corner and fourth down it s interesting you mentioned <person player="gary brackett" race="nonwhite" position="LB">gary brackett</person> he told us the other day we got to get out of here on third down we spend too much time on the field given up third down plays we get tired as it drives sustains itself they got out on third down which they have rarely done john well they got him into third and 10 and that s critical you get this tennessee titans offense off schedule enforcement those third long s that s when they are ineffective you get him at third and short theyll sustain offense veteran punter craig head church now in his 15th year in the league set to kick it away im a deep kick at all only 32 yards taken on the run by <person player="pierre garcon" race="nonwhite" position="WR">pierre garcon</person> it s excellent field position for <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton manning</person> and the colts will take over at the tennessee 36 while <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton manning</person> in tennessee it still sounds right three hours to the east bruza four years started setting 33 school records really leaving that to tennessee program right back to prominent to the sec than the year after he left they won the national championship runnerup to charles woodson may think he still should have won the heisman trophy that season directing the band and ol rocky top paint wanna match although just as good that s right he did it tough times for tennessee football these days but it s still very close to phillip fulmer the head coach says he always enjoys coming back they say hey <person player="chris hope" race="nonwhite" position="DB">hope</person> you do well but dont throw in the game great field position for 37 but if the shot in <person player="dallas clark" race="white" position="TE">dallas</person> park got it and <person player="dallas clark" race="white" position="TE">clark</person> pinball s to the 10 gain of 27 first down mike this is exactly what we have not seen from the indianapolis colts much this season the playaction fake to <person player="dominic rhodes" race="UNK" position="RB">rhodes</person> now you got <person player="dallas clark" race="white" position="TE">dallas clark</person> down the seam and it s the ball that payton throws as well as any quarterback in the national football league while you just get bullet to bite a little bit on that play action you create the scene and we havent seen a lot of payton play a good pocket nobody at his feet had time to throw there dominika roads left side for a couple yards and running in that spot where vandenbosch would be but it s not because we andrew indianapolis wants very much to score right here and get the lead <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton manning</person> told us the other day it is very important we score early we get a lead and we make terry <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">collins</person> have to beat us well that s what they want they want the pressure on the offense of tennessee which is not that great and the colts defense is much better as points at their back empty backfield spreading them out and <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> throws forth guns john <person player="gijon robinson" race="UNK" position="TE">robinson</person> the first year tight end out of mississippi west states missed last week with an ankle you may even go really you know guys john <person player="gijon robinson" race="UNK" position="TE">robinson</person> but ron everything weve heard but they really like this guy certainly doing you know when you look at this offense it is a tight end oriented style of play <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton</person> loves to work the middle if youre with the tight end and of course they like tydings that could catch and they also block they bring <person player="vincent fuller" race="nonwhite" position="DB">vincent fuller</person> back in go five defensive backs stingy at the start titans try to keep <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> out were comin got rid of it to <person player="dallas clark" race="white" position="TE">clark</person> and he s in the endzone for a touchdown and there s <person player="dallas clark" race="white" position="TE">dallas</person> s first of the year and the first in 10 plus games against the titans in the opening frame an excellent job by <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton manning</person> looking left looking left and comes back who s right right now he s getting time in the pocket to survey the field that s key the pressures not hitting he looks left looks left comes back to the right gets rid of the football before <person player="albert haynesworth" race="nonwhite" position="DT">albert haynesworth</person> could make the hit on him excellent job by <person player="dallas clark" race="white" position="TE">dallas clark</person> finding the void in that titans defense all <person player="dallas clark" race="white" position="TE">dallas clark</person> we saw <person player="dallas clark" race="white" position="TE">dallas</person> yesterday and joked with him keeble even gone this long and havent caught a touchdown pass and maybe tonight we take care of it they did in the first quarter <person player="adam vinatieri" race="white" position="K">adam vinatieri</person> adds the extra point indianapolis exactly where they love to play from the lead paint worth trying to get there a second too late and bennett throws the touchdown so many good games in the big 12 weekend week out the old traditional ones still pretty darn good nebraska against number four oklahoma the abbasid sam bradford one of the best quarterbacks in the country trying to stay in the bcs chase that s the espn primetime game <person player="jeff saturday" race="white" position="C">saturday</person> night at 8:00 eastern the big 12 has about 43 quarterbacks that go from 400 yards and a half theyve been every week of course texas texas decker in abc <person player="jeff saturday" race="white" position="C">saturday</person> night that s <person player="jim sorgi" race="white" position="QB">jim</person> schwartz the defensive coordinator tuck with <person player="keith bulluck" race="nonwhite" position="LB">keith</person> bullock about how do we stop <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> in the colts well give them a short field it s just a killer 37 yard drive the short punt into the wind really hurt the titans of that opening drive <person player="chris carr" race="white" position="DB">chris carr</person> brings it out for the title at the seam hard and car stopped in the open feel that goes down for 33 credit <person player="nick graham" race="UNK" position="DB">nick graham</person> for holding on for the tech that would you play against <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton manning</person> you must be fundamental in your mechanics watch <person player="stephen tulloch" race="UNK" position="LB">stephen</person> tell appear after the playaction fake he stops moving his feet youll see him his peering into the bathroom he stops moving and feet that one split second allows <person player="dallas clark" race="white" position="TE">dallas clark</person> to get behind him and payton knows it down little sima squeeze that ball into and he knows that one split second allows that play to open up that window opened up the bait manny nicely titans take over again at the 34 and his first down throw from <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">kerry collins</person> more throws than we have seen in that one a flag comes in as theyre hoping at both escapes running down the seam and he was being held it looks like this one was gonna be on the colts a little contact defense number 58 first down <person player="gary brackett" race="nonwhite" position="LB">gary brackett</person> you have a game between a six and o team in a three and three team you would think the pressure would all be on indianapolis i disagree with that i think the tennessee almost needs to win this game more than indianapolis does because they have to show indianapolis hey were the better team we have this game at home we have you buy three games in the standings and if they dont win the curse of the small market is you lose a lot of credibility theyre sort of like the tampa bay rays where they have to prove themselves all the time all the time and when they dont when people say oh yeah theyre not that good after the automatic first down <person player="lendale white" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lendale white</person> out of the backfield gonna be ruled incomplete as it popped out <person player="lendale white" race="nonwhite" position="RB">white</person> only has a couple of receptions and weve seen got an interesting pass mix with the titans here about 50/50 run past so far well the reason theyre doing that mike youre getting the box loaded up eight defenders in the box by the colts getting those isolation routes on the outside another it s one on one so tennessee trying to take advantage that as mike heimerdinger the offensive creditor calls the plays in the sideline eight pass plays six runs so far and they will go back to the ground and not even getting back to the line of scrimmage is <person player="lendale white" race="nonwhite" position="RB">white</person> again clinch <person player="clint session" race="nonwhite" position="LB">session</person> freddy keauhou leaving that charge in tony to the point you were making a couple of plays ago about having to prove something and sometimes you know like we talked about the beginning when indianapolis has been at the top for so long you could put a lot into this game first monday night game in almost four years a chance to knock them off almost shut them out of way in the division it s dangerous sometimes why i think it is i think that the people on tennessee feel the pressure of this more than the people on indianapolis still it could be third and 11 poems pass complete for the first down to <person player="brandon jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brandon jones</person> across midfield and almost to the 48 yard line to that point mike i think that it s sort of a referendum on tennessee more than it is on indianapolis indianapolis in the playoffs a thousand times theyve won a super ball okay there are a few games behind but theyre waiting to get healthy tennessee looks at this opportunity says finally people are looking at us what can we do and i think they might feel weve got to win this and those who doubt <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">kerry collins</person> and kenny still do it showed a good arm there and completing that past thirteen yards big third down conversion by <person player="kerry collins"

position="LB">session</person> the tackle so what s this mix now seven runs and i think eleven passes yeah theyre really mixing it up and there you saw both scape the tight end split out wide creating favorable matchups for the titans and carrier now finding a good rhythm you see him drive off that back foot snap those hips and deliver the football good rotation on the ball and scape takes it up the field youre talking flash and he s throwing the ball all the time that was early it s still early like it first down run with g<person player="lendale white" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lendale

white" race="nonwhite" position="RB">white</person> to come wider than he wanted and daryl reed gets credit for the tackle is this one of the situations where you have to run or pass to set up your run have to get a guy out of the box no question about it when teams load up the box youve got to take him out of that youve got to get that safety back into pass coverage and that s exactly what mike

stats after the first typical of what we see people try to keep the ball away from <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton manning</person> and the colts but those small

idolized emmitt <person player="hunter smith" race="white" position="P">smith</person> growing up as many did and you think of him it s toughness evans running ability hall of fame running back and he said what he learned in watching evans was that emmitt became so good in passing situations he didnt come off the field and third down situation pass protection was huge and chris said that that s been something he worked on with skip holtz at east carolina and now here is he s arrived at the league and third down situation he stays on the field theyd see many rookie backs in that situation third and six cohen s throw is incomplete as the pressure was coming from <person player="robert mathis" race="nonwhite" position="DE">robert mathis</person> off the edge and well see a long field

putting <person player="quinton ganther" race="UNK" position="RB">ganther</person> it s a running back injury timeout okay were back here in nashville the concerns for <person player="quinton ganther" race="UNK" position="RB">quinton ganther</person> theyre running back out of utah and youll see what happens here on the kickoff coverage and that immediate contact with dawson to the colts you can see he was knocked out on the way down and stayed down for a couple of minutes and the medical personnel still around him music office right down there in front of it suzy looks like he s come to mike that s the good news i watch the trainer s around them and they they slowly did roll him onto his stomach or as kept him quiet in there for a few minutes and now he s getting up thank you right in front of you down there <person player="quinton ganther" race="UNK" position="RB">ganther</person> on the practice squad most of the last couple of years only played in four games coming into this

roads the back only ran nine plays in the first quarter <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> s throw the long throw to <person player="marvin harrison" race="UNK" position="WR">marvin harrison</person> is incomplete blows second down so the cokes havent been what we are used to within the last five years first or second or third in the national football league and scored thus far this year the precipitous drop down to 20th it s scoring in the nfl it s a touchdown the game if you cant give off the touchdown again litany of problems on the offensive line no running back seventy yards it just took to maintain consistency with all those injuries and here is the run for roads gain of about three let s start with where that all started to break down <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton manning</person> misses all of training camp all of the preseason has the second procedure on his knee which was not because of an infection he had an infection then surgery not surgery then an infection so that this shortcircuited the preparation of this offense and took a while from <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> to get stuck and then you add on the injuries the offensive front <person player="marvin harrison" race="UNK" position="WR">marvin harrison</person> back from knee injury and it s not the offense weve seen quick third and seven good pocket there to throw and it is intercepted through the hands of into the hands of presto and a flag down initial defense there from <person player="vincent fuller" race="nonwhite" position="DB">vincent</person> s floor as it popped up mic carries just laying both sidelines know that there was gonna be no break the play was gonna go on he wasnt trying to whip the crowd into a frenzy night for those are you wondering puts the official doing after the ball was dead personal foul unnecessary roughness tennessee number 31 that s on courtland <person player="cortland finnegan" race="nonwhite" position="DB">finnegan</person> who s had a couple of questionable penalties this year first the pic yeah <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton manning</person> does have time in the pocket he kind of zeroes in out to his left he thinks he s got <person player="reggie wayne" race="nonwhite" position="WR">reggie wayne</person> and he does have <person player="reggie wayne" race="nonwhite" position="WR">reggie wayne</person> matched in a position where he wants to get him the football when racing topology zips up in the air clearly you know <person player="vincent fuller" race="nonwhite" position="DB">vincent fuller</person> in good position to you know to defend waiting on the play they came with a stack trying to get a free release for the titans did a great job of adapting of that changing the offensive scheme through <person player="vincent fuller" race="nonwhite" position="DB">fuller</person> s handsoff <person player="reggie wayne" race="nonwhite" position="WR">wayne</person> s forearm and the 12th career interception for the titans db as the first down pass out the junction brings the ball back out and it looks like the colts they think they have it you can hear the titan singing it was down still no official signal yet they confer no hopes are on their way off the field but it s going to stay with the titans and near first down yardage and then dawson with the hit well clearly all is clearly out is out and hits the ground that <person player="jeff saturday" race="white" position="C">jeff</person> fisher is very attuned to the rules he has rushed the team back up there to get the snap off inside and they do get the first down with johnson running to the 32 yard line bonz clearly out and no official made a signal that one team or the other recovered the fumble and you did hear the conversation that he was down only colts were there around the ball so it was something that could have been challenged as long as we clearly saw there there was a recovery by the post that pass doesnt get it back for the colts off the hands of bracket into the arms of <person player="clint session" race="nonwhite" position="LB">session</person> <person player="clint session" race="nonwhite" position="LB">clint</person> couldnt catch it it s incomplete and somebody s buttered the ball here the last big place you see <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">kerry</person> trying to squeeze didnt bracket in perfect position on the slant route tipton in the air and sessions almost makes the pick and he would have had a chance to take away that was going to the house and nobody on this side of the field place election interesting from the titans quite a bit of first down passing you dont normally see that from them second and ten for <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">collins</person> to both scape that tight end out of texas has really become significant contributor in this offense gain of seventy one thing you see from <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">kerry collins</person> is the composure in the pocket he doesnt break down mechanically he stares downfield he goes here s progression youll see him right here as he drops back sets nice seeing the cradle looks left bank comes back to the right side doesnt force the ball takes a nice positive gain the high percentage throw try to move the chains this is not an explosive offense it s a sustaining offense in tennessee third and four power pass is deflected <person player="robert mathis" race="nonwhite" position="DE">robert mathis</person> got a piece of it it s an incomplete forward pass but fourth down in a 43yard field goal attempt coming up youll see the pressure right up the middle for malthus before he gets airborne there and bats this ball up in the air really had good penetration on the play you can see johnson trying to make the block johnson have to go out and attack i like that he s waiting to catch the weight very impressive all right so the wind at his back <person player="rob bironas" race="white" position="K">bironas</person> for a franchiserecord 21st consecutive field goal good from 34 and 44 for 43 hell stay tied for the record without del greco wide left and after all that something good brush off the edge by <person player="daniel muir" race="nonwhite" position="DT">daniel muir</person> seven six quarters colts take over with a onepoint lead almost four minutes gone by <person player="albert haynesworth" race="nonwhite" position="DT">albert haynesworth</person> big factor usually what about tonight yeah the colts did a nice job on there you see <person player="charlie johnson" race="nonwhite" position="OT">charlie johnson</person> one on one he contains an ounce gonna be a little bit of a doubleteam right there help on the inside <person player="jeff saturday" race="white" position="C">jeff saturday</person> doing a good job once again the doubleteam excellent job and then also he can try to get the cut block on him yes he gets it those told me you go and then payton takes a shot but so far the holston a real good job of negating the talents of <person player="albert haynesworth" race="nonwhite" position="DT">albert haynesworth</person> but <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton manning</person> tell us yesterday guys <person player="albert haynesworth" race="nonwhite" position="DT">haynesworth</person> in the last year your franchise players somebody sign up yeah you got a one year looking for a big strategic deal said give him the money calm him down dominika <person player="dominic rhodes" race="UNK" position="RB">rhodes</person> with the run good job by <person player="dominic rhodes" race="UNK" position="RB">rhodes</person> to stay on his feet to the 38 yard line it s a fiveyard gain so we mentioned nope tile vandenbosch the pro bowl defensive end the impact of no vandenbosch plus <person player="albert haynesworth" race="nonwhite" position="DT">haynesworth</person> being contained would be what run well the fact is that you gain five yards there on first down and that puts you ahead of the down it through the colts that opens up the entire playbook for <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton manning</person> and most importantly the playaction pass game which for the most part has been missing this year come back in the first quarter second and five <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> s throw is held on to by <person player="dallas clark" race="white"

used to clicker backandforth tonight well keep you updated on what s going on here 4:49 into the backfield <person player="dominic rhodes" race="UNK" position="RB">rhodes</person> is met by half the titan defense and they just brought <person player="albert haynesworth" race="nonwhite" position="DT">albert haynesworth</person> off the field for that snap but <person player="tony brown" race="nonwhite" position="DE">tony brown</person> helps to lead the charge they always say what can <person player="tony brown" race="nonwhite" position="DE">brown</person> do for you he can do that he can stop the play <person player="tony brown" race="nonwhite" position="DE">tony brown</person> does a terrific job there number 97 it s all about penetration he just takes mike pollack the rookie throws him in the backfield the fiveyard loss the guy was out of football in 2005 and playing at a very high level and this is second full season with the tight second a long straight to <person player="dominic rhodes" race="UNK" position="RB">rhodes</person> who is by <person player="tony brown" race="nonwhite" position="DE">brown</person> again once again <person player="tony brown" race="nonwhite" position="DE">tony brown</person> doing a terrific job of understanding what he has to do and youll see <person player="tony brown" race="nonwhite" position="DE">tony brown</person> right there he knows once his fall step he s thinking this situation might be a screen so he sees the back rows check down he s right there to make the play good intuitive play by <person player="tony brown" race="nonwhite" position="DE">tony brown</person> and the last guy there was the sick around pick from this year mike paulo at arizona state couldnt handle five dbs three receivers third law rush <person player="dominic rhodes" race="UNK" position="RB">rhodes</person> you know were near the first down <person player="nick harper" race="nonwhite" position="DB">nick harper</person> or <person player="eric king" race="nonwhite" position="DB">eric king</person> over there to make the stop and the former colt <person player="nick harper" race="nonwhite" position="DB">harper</person> on the tackle mail kick it away but if youre the colts are feeling good about one thing right now <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton manning</person> is getting time to survey the field all season long he s been under duress i think the offensive line of the col to start to get a little more comfortable up front folks dont have the proper personnel out there it appears unless they got a trick up their sleeves this is going into the wind here from the titans 44 for the punter <person player="hunter smith" race="white" position="P">hunter smith</person> this car no fair catch at the 14 and nowhere to go either as he s tied up <person player="philip wheeler" race="nonwhite" position="LB">philip wheeler</person> making the tackles so that drives the defensive front <person player="albert haynesworth" race="nonwhite" position="DT">albert haynesworth</person> do the job on banning folks leave by one well they see <person player="vince young" race="nonwhite" position="QB">vince young</person> great career texas 30 and 2 is the starter 1 the old 5 title game came here to tennessee been an upanddown first couple of years looking for that upanddown to be honest then week 1 he suffers this knee injury sprained mcl that happened after he was being food and had to be encouraged to come back on the field may the reports that he didnt want to come back out of the field then goes out a couple plays later gets injured has been out <person player="jeff saturday" race="white" position="C">jeff</person> fisher immediately says after the whole deal was they couldnt find <person player="vince young" race="nonwhite" position="QB">vince young</person> where it was he concerned about a handgun in the car etc etc <person player="gary brackett" race="nonwhite" position="LB">gary</person> <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">collins</person> at quarterback <person player="vince young" race="nonwhite" position="QB">vince young</person> s the backup when he s healthy he s healthy he s the backup here s <person player="chris johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris johnson</person> with a run to the 20 gain of 6 <person player="vince young" race="nonwhite" position="QB">vince young</person> is the once and future franchise quarterback fisher has made that clear the only question is when will this be and mike you alluded to something very important what players ask for in a coach is to be decisive kevin the wise said everybody was wondering how is <person player="jeff saturday" race="white" position="C">jeff</person> gonna handle this he came in decisively he said number 10 is hurt carries our guy until further notice <person player="jeff saturday" race="white" position="C">jeff</person> made a decision that was that and everybody on this team responded well to it youre 6 and oh so there s no controversy you know so you dont have to worry about it but they admired the way fisher hand<person player="ed johnson" race="UNK" position="DT">ed johnson</person> stretching it toward the edge great job coming up from the safety spot by <person player="melvin bullitt" race="UNK" position="DB">melvin</person> bullet who s filling in for <person player="bob sanders" race="nonwhite" position="DB">bob sanders</person> third down now the greater question with <person player="vince young" race="nonwhite" position="QB">vince young</person> is this he s going to be the franchise quarterback but is this a real problem how does he respond to criticism how will he grow from this because because there s so much heat and light on this position as you know jaws that if you are temperamental e unsuited to the criticism it can eat you up you know if <person player="vince young" race="nonwhite" position="QB">vince young</person> probably doesnt want to hear this but i think it s good that he can sit back relax right now take a deep breath let <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">kerry collins</person> run this offense and let him learn from the sideline to be better prepare when he does go back in <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">collins</person> on third and five throws to johnson and a good play by <person player="antoine bethea" race="nonwhite" position="DB">antoine bethea</person> and this indianapolis defense really been good the last couple of drives when theyve had a long field to work with theyve gotten the titans off three and out and mike <person player="melvin bullitt" race="UNK" position="DB">melvin bullitt</person> the safety has really flashed you know when <person player="bob sanders" race="nonwhite" position="DB">bob sanders</person> is is gone you kind of expect oh boy that defense is really in trouble <person player="melvin bullitt" race="UNK" position="DB">melvin</person> bullet is beginning to make plays almost like <person player="bob sanders" race="nonwhite" position="DB">bob</person> sam dont go there oh i said all i said almost <person player="bob sanders" race="nonwhite" position="DB">bob sanders</person> is a combination of chuck norris and jack bauer dont go there but what s making play like a bullet out there wind at his back for henrik better kick fair cut by <person player="pierre garcon" race="nonwhite" position="WR">garcon</person> missed it let s get across from 20 yards all the way down to the six that s just the bad play youve got to catch the football 74 yards for shy of hendrix career long which is 78 next monday night on the eve of election day will be in our nation s capital to see the pittsburgh steelers mo washington redskins redskins coming off the win at ford field over the line six and two steelers boos to the giants yesterday theyre five and two that giants victory keeps new york of the top but washington just a half flight back gain time in the northeast steelers steelers redskins knicks monday night dc the rookie mistake are so letting the putco cost them 25 yards folks take over at their own six and a rogue s entered the g on <person player="gijon robinson" race="UNK" position="TE">robinson</person> inside end but still bounces off his own player to make it an eightyard gain a nice job in play calling by <person player="tom santi" race="white" position="TE">tom</person> moore the offensive quarter for the colts spread the field ill get that little quick trap give the illusion im gonna throw the football awesome bang here comes that quick trap inside picks up eight yards lemon seasons offensive coordinator <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton manning</person> quarterback 11 season in his guise from the start job by roads and they come out of inside their own 10yard line to get to the 22 at a first down you mentioned before mike about <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton</person> missing practices because of the knee operation i would have felt as a fan <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton manning</person> could miss anything he wanted because he s got the same receivers and he knows what he s doing he s the easiest guy to come back into it after the play george hell tell me why im stupid on them after the colts push from rushing first downers <person player="dallas clark" race="white" position="TE">dallas clark</person> making a man miss and there are some feels pretty good the offense is taking him out to the three well tony <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton manning</person> is is the consummate timing and rhythm quarterback a perfectionist he needs to work at his trade he needs to feel totally comfortable it with his receivers and his own talents and being away for practice for 35 days he was not comfortable that really slowed him down early sees he s starting to find that rhythm but you explained to me that it wasnt because he missed games preseason games it was the practice that that it you know as allen iverson would say price is but apparently with <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton manning</person> the control freak that he is practice is the most important thing well the football is the consummate team game the quarterback of his receivers must be on the same page they must work together constantly every single day so they keep that rhythm they keep that harmony you know you missed 35 practice and then you got to go back to <person player="marvin harrison" race="UNK" position="WR">marvin harrison</person> a year ago <person player="marvin harrison" race="UNK" position="WR">marvin</person> got hurt they threw they didnt practice for almost like nine months together that that really thought everyone said back tried to get out of practice and tried to get him the way he works it s so important to him and you know we knew that he started against the bears of the opener and we knew he was injured leading up in that process to keeping that streak alive eat when they tell us this week that no i dont gain any ground on farm the farm keeps going with this 167th consecutive start but to keep that streak alive and open the new stadium and do everything by being there for he worked so hard much harder than i think any of us had an idea and my guy had a chance to talk some of the coaches before the game and they raised about what paid have you to get ready for that bear game but the problem isnt anyone that could have come back from the injury and played opening day but they did second and won a bounce to the outside of <person player="dominic rhodes" race="UNK" position="RB">rhodes</person> gets the first down he keeps going through the 40yard line to the colts running game looking good this is a football team the colts on often say came in the national football league ranked dead last rushing the football they dont look that way tonight but like i said earlier theyre starting to get healthy on the offensive line tony you go back at left tackle they can move <person player="charlie johnson" race="nonwhite" position="OT">charlie johnson</person> down in there at left guard <person player="jeff saturday" race="white" position="C">jeff saturday</person> is now back to the beginning to get their continuity very busy roads is tripped up and will only gain a couple of yards you know george you can say about how theyre getting healthy and talked about players in there i think this game is on <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton manning</person> i think it s on his racquet i think <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton manning</person> sees himself as coming in here against the team he beats a lot a team at six at home and it s his chance to say were not dead yet as a team in indianapolis okay were not upset responsibility every game roads out the rookie <person player="chad simpson" race="UNK" position="RB">chad simpson</person> he s been running back and his pass is incomplete as <person player="stephen tulloch" race="UNK" position="LB">stephen</person> toeic did a nice job with <person player="dallas clark" race="white" position="TE">dallas clark</person> the intended receiver guys weve seen <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton</person> forever he s 32 years old 11 used to us a lot of good football ahead of him and i thought it was interesting this week reading he he had the trainer s and some of his folks call the people who are around marino and elway and far and you preserve your body for the back half of your career obviously is on the second portion of it

first down at the 46 yard line <person player="david thornton" race="nonwhite" position="LB">thornton</person> pressure a second too late yet <person player="david thornton" race="nonwhite" position="LB">thornton</person> comes with the quick pressure on <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton manning</person> to me this is mobility when you can get away from the pass rush that really is the key that s what <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton manning</person> does there s quick pressure on him right there you see him sidestep to his left knows he has <person player="reggie wayne" race="nonwhite" position="WR">reggie wayne</person> on the underneath route and delivers a football perfectly that s mobility avoid to pass luck

halftime show coming up for the fastest three minutes some of that giants pittsburgh game the huge win for the giants in pittsburgh great second half defense and tommy will have the keys to the second half coming up on the toyota halftime show you seen something of a role reversal here the tennessee defense during the timeout when they were down on their knees sucking win this usually happens indianapolis tennessee is used to stopping you immediately and getting the ball back theyre not used to being out gifted it look this length of time third and 15 sitting and peering in at <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton manning</person> the hand signal goes out to <person player="reggie wayne" race="nonwhite" position="WR">reggie wayne</person> and <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> throws complete to <person player="dominic rhodes" race="UNK" position="RB">rhodes</person> he stopped shy of the first down <person player="david thornton" race="nonwhite" position="LB">thornton</person> getting there with portland <person player="cortland finnegan" race="nonwhite" position="DB">finnegan</person> and from the 45 another punch for the colts tennessee not choosing to take a timeout theyve the full complement a little bit surprised that the titans have not taken time there he is all right let a lot but a lot of time run off that clock before calling the timeout so we get in here with a minute 32 so weve seen a lot of hunters smoothies the games we didnt see him for years the witness protection program was being the punter for indianapolis they wholly scored touchdown it at more touchdowns than punts for four years and you see the flip this year updating it with the numbers tonight ten more putts than touchdowns obviously the way you want to finish drives the way you dont want drives to finish and the number is flipped this year is tony dungy saying were just frustrated with not moving the ball and not scoring he was the one who alluded to the fact were used to getting more touchdowns than punts in i mean they still have an offense but theyre you know that theyre down a full touchdown again to us i know there s a lot of reasons for this but you give away seven points a game when youre a great offensive team and that s why i mean let s rule if theyre not a great offense there you are now theyre not right now theyre getting better but theyre not rush on <person player="hunter smith" race="white" position="P">smith</person> their catch signal for and great job to get the endoverend action on the ball that s why it dies so well and down by justin s <person player="justin snow" race="UNK" position="TE">snow</person> at the 5yard line yeah we didnt expect this at the colts defense would be outstanding against the run they have stroke pencil run but they are getting penetration theyre fast theyre quick they get in the backfield that s exactly what theyre doing against the tight you can see the line of scrimmage is being pushed back into the titans backfield the defense right now up front and the linebackers of course and <person player="melvin bullitt" race="UNK" position="DB">melvin</person> bolt the safety they are winning this matchup on that side of the football for the colts it s interesting now youre at your own fiveyard line minute 21 left tennessee has two timeouts indianapolis has all three so if they can get a first down stop he s certainly going to use those timeouts you may have a chance to get the ball back somers field goal going right to left is hard that s into the wind which johnson on the first down run games a yard colts should use their time out here yeah now theyre just kind of getting around to it and get one from the sidelines a couple of seconds in this is the position if you are tennessee where you dont want terry <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">collins</person> winging it right well you want to get a first down but you want to get the first down running the football in this situation you do not want to give <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton manning</person> this football back theyre gonna run the football i believe theyre giving the football back to faith <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> somewhere around the 50 yard line it could have no timeouts and probably about 40 seconds left i dont think theyll be slinging it down here if they do itll be a nice safe high percentage type throwing then you leave the colts if they get it back on a three now at the time im out a chance to move the ball yeah now this were stranded youve become very very important and that may have been one of the reasons she officially little hesitant to take the time out before fourth down go wait a minute do i really want to leave more time for them to tender yeah yeah you cant think that way mike you gotta think a were gonna get good field position were on the score chris <person player="jeff saturday" race="white" position="C">jeff</person> is a defensive minded guy so he may not sit that way second and nine from their own six <person player="chris johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris johnson</person> the lone back and well get to the end you look at the first down in bounds at the 18yard line <person player="jeff saturday" race="white" position="C">jeff</person> fischer not calling timeout here with 55 seconds to go yeah i think hell be happy to get out of here with a onepoint deficit right now with this offense being backed up if they do get an explosive play here i think then theyll go in there their speed offense right now it s just kind of sugar huddle let s go you always see people do this weekend we got hashed trapped and by in a twominute drill are not flag is down as both skate patches tight end stays in bounds of the 23 yard line donte <person player="dante hughes" race="UNK" position="DB">hughes</person> traffic at a cow last year made the tackle it s one thrown along the line of scrimmage in legal hands to the face defense number 98 john <person player="robert mathis" race="nonwhite" position="DE">robert mathis</person> will take the ball to the 28 yard line titans two timeouts left 34 seconds he got both escapes with a forearm across the face along the way that escape was late getting off the ball he s looking back in the backfield at carey so first and 10 half minute left johnson are we almost gave it up it s an incomplete pass it s ruled it almost came out on the fly tomorrow and <person player="marlin jackson" race="UNK" position="DB">jackson</person> was over there yeah passing situations <person player="dwight freeney" race="nonwhite" position="DE">dwight freeney</person> is a beast up against michael ruse he s going to get quick pressure you see number 71 ruse having a tough time with <person player="dwight freeney" race="nonwhite" position="DE">dwight freeney</person> pushing him back into <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">kerry collins</person> <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">kerry</person> leaning back throwing this ball had a break right now for the titans this was almost intercepted and it would have been a touchdown second and ten each team two timeouts left is you see hurt somebody said watch the drawing there it was out of the gun john center there s a 25yard line i think this pillow fight of a twominute drill will come to an end here you talk about the chess match that s exactly what it was i think both coaches say hey you know what seven and six let s get the halftime squeeze a lot of pawns going on those twominute drives right get us out of here is what theyre saying well have to chess match in the second half right now indianapolis will get the ball first payton as the only touchdown pass to <person player="dallas clark" race="white" position="TE">dallas</person> club seven six coats and here s chris berman play on a halftime show back in nashville this is the tenth year of the tennessee titans the former houston oilers and three of the guys who made the tennessee titans go part of the core of that run that went to the super bowl in 99 the afc champ it ducked it into the titan boiler hall of fame and ring of honor here tonight eddie george frank wycheck and steve mcnair ceremony just wrapping up on the field of a moment ago here at halftime really these guys representing so much of the very tough road this franchise had after the houston transition eddie george the alltime leading rusher fourtime pro bowlers started every game of his titans career impressive numbers the former ohio state great and the fans who saw those guys go through the very difficult times does this franchise move from houston they were working at a trailers working not here and nashville didnt have a home stadium to play in couple years in memphis the liberty bowl frank wycheck who threw the pass on this field that went to the music city miracle beating buffalo and blood adams the owner from back to the houston oiler days so really the afl 49 years this franchise handing the award to why check and then steve mcnair most wins with his team mvp with <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton manning</person> in 2003 of the national football league a threetime pro bowler all three honors mcnair why check in any george at halftime here tonight in nashville but adams the owner the owner of since his franchise start the nfl quite an honor you know there s a lot of angst about the move from houston here to tennessee and those are the guys who helped lay that foundation for that incredible season in 99 what an amazing trio great football players got to know all those guys pretty well pretty good people as well good to see him honor here this evening it was nice that steve mcnair went out for the coin toss and <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton manning</person> was out there the two men who shared the league mvp 500 go with a chance to say hello kind of a chapter closing for all those individuals indianapolis gets it to start the third quarter of the colts lead by one the return for <person player="pierre garcon" race="nonwhite" position="WR">pierre garcon</person> down the left side a nice return by <person player="pierre garcon" race="nonwhite" position="WR">garcon</person> he s has shown the sidelines in 36 after the mistake in the first half able to get things going 7 6 here we are a 3rd quarter john s give me a headline to start this second half where as the titans running game that s it this is a team that i expected to come out here and move the football via the rushing game it hasnt happened i think the speed of the colts defense right now is giving the proper to giving problems at offensive line in tennessee tony what s the column story i think the column right now is the colts arent dead yet they have in sack <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton manning</person> he hasnt really had big explosive plays the longer they let the colts in this game the better chance <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton manning</person> has win the game titans havent faced the passing attack all season like the colts have or at least had for years and years especially came off the sideline mark <person player="pierre garcon" race="nonwhite" position="WR">garcon</person> out correctly so by the way at the 36 and dominique <person player="dominic rhodes" race="UNK" position="RB">rhodes</person> starts the half down the sideline <person player="jevon kearse" race="nonwhite" position="DE">jevon kearse</person> pulls them towards the edge with a first down into tennessee territory and a big run by <person player="dominic rhodes" race="UNK" position="RB">rhodes</person> 23 yards well here by anybody on that team well theyre getting the running game going and they came into this game knowing they had to have the run a little bit better at least the threat of the run to get it going have any running game and it has personally it has paid some dividends it got a little bit seen individuals have more dont dance struggle they made a couple long runs <person player="dominic rhodes" race="UNK" position="RB">rhodes</person> in a 38 earlier this year that one a big one to get him down here to the 41 yard line and <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> steps up from <person player="marvin harrison" race="UNK" position="WR">marvin harrison</person> working up by <person player="nick harper" race="nonwhite" position="DB">nick harper</person> who s seen <person player="marvin harrison" race="UNK" position="WR">harrison</person> and <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> a few times when he plays for the colts from oh 1:06 you know what a fantastic play by <person player="nick harper" race="nonwhite" position="DB">nick harper</person> had <person player="marvin harrison" race="UNK" position="WR">marvin harrison</person> on his patented post route off the play action he s got a mantoman its porters coverage no one in centerfield and <person player="nick harper" race="nonwhite" position="DB">nick harper</person> does a terrific job going over the top of <person player="marvin harrison" race="UNK" position="WR">marvin harrison</person> and tipping the ball away might have been just a hair under thrown for years that s a touchdown for knitters second and ten run with roads to the outside so no <person player="joseph addai" race="nonwhite" position="RB">joseph</person> a dyin dominique <person player="dominic rhodes" race="UNK" position="RB">rhodes</person> with a couple of good runs just want to write up the line for a first down right now the colts offensive line doing a real nice job right here this little misdirection play get that tennessee defense flowing one leg come back another way this is not a complex colts running game they probably got about four or five running plays but theyre effective right now to start this second half you know ron interesting to see <person player="charlie johnson" race="nonwhite" position="OT">charlie johnson</person> s over there left guard because tony you go return to the starting lineup and theyve hit him a couple of times with good hard runs to that left edge yeah he got remember <person player="jamie silva" race="UNK" position="DB">jamie</person> <person player="jamey richard" race="white" position="C">richard</person> the whoopie was playing though they were playing to brookie guards that offensive line there start to get a little healthier and obviously a little better look at titan showing blitz right now sad simpsons the running back on third and one it brings <person player="marvin harrison" race="UNK" position="WR">harrison</person> in to support and the first town is gained by <person player="chad simpson" race="UNK" position="RB">simpson</person> the rookie out of morgan state activated to the practice squad last week started his career in college at south florida before wrapping up at morgan state and he brings speed to this colt offense once again you see the colts offensive line coming off the football you know you dont need to get much movement in the third in one situation they hold the gaps they create a few seams and <person player="chad simpson" race="UNK" position="RB">simpson</person> can get through reaction man a hit as he grows for <person player="reggie wayne" race="nonwhite" position="WR">wayne</person> incomplete the pressure coming from the big fella <person player="albert haynesworth" race="nonwhite" position="DT">albert haynesworth</person> hit manic he was staring <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> down right before the game star will take his eyes off <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton</person> and there the two exchanged comments on the way back to the huddle well hannes where does a terrific job coming in here his work and work he gets double team to start the play but it s a it s a play that takes a long time what were three seconds of develop the double team could not hold hands were at that long he got the baton just as he was throwing the football hatin baby could not drive the hips through the football constantly on his drone second and ten <person player="chad simpson" race="UNK" position="RB">chad simpson</person> with that speed right to the line almost a first down at the 20yard line <person player="chad simpson" race="UNK" position="RB">simpson</person> only have two carries for one yard coming in tonight i know mike that you thought it was hyperbole when i said that nineteen individuals had more yards than the entire colts team but going into this game 19 actually did now in this second half youre seeing a run introduction by the colts a gavin seen all year long and if they can do that and hold the ball you know im in tennessee s not expecting this tennessee s not out on the field for this length of time right josh im not worried about team yep pains worse on the sidelines and were seeing lead again what s going on you know tony had mentioned earlier that you know get the tip seat deepest looked a little tired well <person player="chad simpson" race="UNK" position="RB">chad simpson</person> comes in her and his biggest asset is asleep this is quickness he s getting through the hole i wasnt doubting your numbers tony really liked the long run that one long run theyve had all i made that last time out tennessee was doubting tony this telecast is copyrighted by the nfl for the private use of our audience any other use of this telecast or any pictures descriptions or accounts of the game without the nfl s consent is prohibited back in nashville after the indianapolis called timeout the colts 3 and 3 the titans blasted the unbeatens in the national football league matter of fact they win tonight their t games clear of everybody else in the afc they win tonight mercury morris and all his pals are drinking champagne right if indianapolis right took the time out before third and short and his <person player="chad simpson" race="UNK" position="RB">simpson</person> going less and he has the first down darryl <person player="darrell reid" race="nonwhite" position="DE">reid</person> who comes down from time to time in there a fullback does just that and a first down for the colts in the red zone yeah del <person player="darrell reid" race="nonwhite" position="DE">reid</person> at fullback because the colts dont have a fullback on their roster when you got to get a yard you put a guy in there number 95 and follow him read normally a defensive tackle children 88 pounds oh get behind him in gainey yard they dont line up with traditional fullback sometimes like this just ct on <person player="gijon robinson" race="UNK" position="TE">robinson</person> <person player="philip wheeler" race="nonwhite" position="LB">wheeler</person> tight in dot the im <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> looking up top for <person player="josh thomas" race="UNK" position="DE">thomas</person> <person player="dallas clark" race="white" position="TE">clark</person> could not hang on as courtland <person player="cortland finnegan" race="nonwhite" position="DB">finnegan</person> was closing itll be second down that s two plays in this drive that again shows for the last three years each is a touchdown the one to <person player="marvin harrison" race="UNK" position="WR">harrison</person> the one to <person player="dallas clark" race="white" position="TE">clark</person> theyre missing just by inches but when the ball goes up in the air you say that s touchdown well it s <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton manning</person> well that one should have been caught that was right in the hands of <person player="dallas clark" race="white" position="TE">dallas clark</person> the other one to <person player="marvin harrison" race="UNK" position="WR">marvin harrison</person> i would say was slightly under thrown it s a little bit out of rhythm right now but theyre passing out of running downs and running on the passing downs been effective this drive it s a passing gallo tommyrot if they stay to the floor although he s checking out his play he s got a cover to shell mighty little clay actor trying to get something down the scene and the pump and the throw for court began finally call them like that tony well you played this game out of your mind so many times to us then i know you suck like you saw coming to me my game he played in his mind bond the only time i saw so clarke who wins five games he missed one game without a touchdown has to here tonight his first two of the season yeah it s all about the eyes i discipline <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton manning</person> looking left looking down the middle of the pump fake he knew all along he wanted to get the football to <person player="dallas clark" race="white" position="TE">dallas clark</person> on the seam route he needed to manipulate the secondary he had time to do it and the coverage to is what he saw yeah they started with a cover to show but they changed up after the snap but payton sought that s a ball a snap it was <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton manning</person> who said to us the other day they have not faced a passing attack this entire season such as we have now he s got two touchdown passes and he s having a good night especially against the defense like that and no sacks and now were gonna find out about the tennessee titans just the one question everyone s been asking what happens they get behind but well never be there a running team theyve been playing with the lead their you know their week schedule thus far with number 91 on the defense that power we enforced on the kickoff ill be on <person player="jason jones" race="nonwhite" position="DE">jason jones</person> so we got a comeback yep <person player="dallas clark" race="white" position="TE">dallas clark</person> first three touchdowns of the year the colts have an eightpoint lead tennessee is a couple of field goals indianapolis a couple of touchdowns and the titans have their largest deficit of the season down eight after the colts get it to start the third and go nine plays in 64 yards capped off by the second alice <person player="dallas clark" race="white" position="TE">clark</person> touchdown of the night were looking at something i mean if the colts were to go on and win the coach of three and three but they could easily be one in five they were down 15 nothing at one point to minnesota against houston they were way down when when say frozen fell selfdestructed for them to come in here should they win this game put enormous in terms of confidence for a team like the colts and with the winders bag finitary kicks it all the way to the goal line and now <person player="gary brackett" race="nonwhite" position="LB">gary</person> <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">collins</person> and the titans offense will try to find some sort of a mixing it s really been inconsistent for them here tonight the majority of their place i visited being past place as opposed to runs you know the build upon what tony was talking about a moment ago we talked to bill polian before the game and he was talking about the injury factor theyre gonna get <person player="joseph addai" race="nonwhite" position="RB">joseph addai</person> back next week theyre gonna get <person player="bob sanders" race="nonwhite" position="DB">bob sanders</person> back next week so they begin to hit the meat of their schedule theyre gonna be a little healthier next week against new england first intention of 20 it s been a lot of <person player="chris johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris johnson</person> tonight runs into dawson the defensive tackle gainer drink to that point im never saying napoleon to saying de polian well if i use the word deterioration with the iowa would i be off pacing it looked at me he smile he said yes i think you would but you but right now we see tennessee in the role that they are more familiar with in past years and that s the underdog role theyve suddenly shifted to be the underdog in this game gaalan s on second down good time to throw it completes it to ouchie <person player="alge crumpler" race="nonwhite" position="TE">crumpler</person> and the veteran takes <person player="gary brackett" race="nonwhite" position="LB">gary brackett</person> across the marker and a first down susie called get mike this is a complete role reversal when i spoke to <person player="jeff saturday" race="white" position="C">jeff</person> fischer and a half time he told me that they really need to be able to run the ball in the second half i asked him if he was surprised that they havent been able to make that onetwo punch work and he said not at all because the colts have such great team speed they said that s what we were most concerned about all week tony dungy followed with his team is playing with great energy staying in their gaps but number 28 is awfully dangerous and watch out there s been much more <person player="chris johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris johnson</person> as opposed to <person player="lendale white" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lendale white</person> tonight s is <person player="brandon jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brandon jones</person> with the caption along the sideline hit by the combination of freddy keauhou and <person player="tim jennings" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tim jennings</person> but a good first down passing kick up with jones it is fourth year now out of oklahoma but were seeing a pattern here from the tennessee offense running games short passing game eventually theyre gonna have to take some shots theyre gonna have to back up the secondary the annapolis colt theyre sitting in every pass route theyre not backing up there are very few boys in that secondary right now theyre gonna have to take a deep shot between the tackles johnson nowhere to go <person player="gary brackett" race="nonwhite" position="LB">gary brackett</person> the captain of the defense the tackle here s trey wingo down sportscenter right now all right michael thank you very much chiefs running back larry johnson charged and released in the kansas city court today with simple assault this is the fourth time he s been involved in one of these situations stemming from an incident october 10th meanwhile game five of the world series phillies win the world series champs for the first time since 1980 they lead a two to one in a driving rainstorm in philly highlights on sportscenter after the game let s send it back to mike jones owner correct words driving rainstorm their third down and <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">collins</person> throws for gay to cut it and put it back on the ground incomplete so marlon <person player="marlin jackson" race="UNK" position="DB">jackson</person> makes the hit penalty marker down in the secondary let s see what the call will be late flag here we go contact defense number 28 push down you see <person player="justin gage" race="UNK" position="WR">gage</person> goes up and just takes this ball away does a terrific job but marlon <person player="marlin jackson" race="UNK" position="DB">jackson</person> sneaks the hand in there and strips the ball away looks like <person player="justin gage" race="UNK" position="WR">gage</person> has possession an excellent job by <person player="marlin jackson" race="UNK" position="DB">jackson</person> reaching the hand in stripping the ball there s that <person player="marlin jackson" race="UNK" position="DB">jackson</person> as he saw was a bit shaken up with that left leg after the play didnt see the contact but first down from the 43 for <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">collins</person> another first down throw to that side that is incomplete scooped off the deck by justin mccarran the more the game goes like this with tennessee having to come from behind the more you look at the schedule they played so far the teams have an aggregate record of 14 and 29 so you wonder to what degree is a six a no start just the benefit of of a beneficial schedule for this team again my point would be that they have to win this game tennessee to sort of prove that they belong in the upper echelon of the afc and now the tanks loading up the box eight defenders blend down why do it negative rushing yards in the first half whitehead she carries 43 yards <person player="gary brackett" race="nonwhite" position="LB">gary</person> bracket makes the tackle third down coming up i dont know what the upper echelon of the afc is right now a new england when we were sitting all together a week ago in foxborough ben crew kind of in a desperate spot right right now it s five and two theyre right up there with the secondbest record along with buffalo and pittsburgh now everyone was on both of which were long and wagon buffaloes bandwagon all sudden they both came up with somewhat clunkers yesterday here s the bandwagon nobody s on at the moment san diego s bandwagon three and five with the loss of the london to the saints third down butch shone green he came across he said somebody s in tennessee bugs first false start offense number 54 fiveyard kill me too but you made the point to us to see whether or not tennessee could rally back from behind they dont seem to be built for the national football league in the 2000s that s a quarterback league and a wide receiver league and they do this with running backs and they do it with defense and it s almost like theyre built for the 1950 yeah im theyre not throwing the football down the field there there s their style so that s what they want to do but i mean when you look at college he told his arm strength was 95 percent of what it was when he was in his prime well you look like brad johnson right now nothing put more than five yards down the field third down free knee trying to spin his way in good protection and complete the first down did justin mccarran s at the 36 yard line mccarran s who had a hamstring injury didnt play last week against kansas city with a big catch for 22 there we go thatll open up first of all you got a block <person player="dwight freeney" race="nonwhite" position="DE">dwight freeney</person> michael ruse on him right there you see <person player="chris johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris johnson</person> looking to help out but a good job by ruse when youre throwing the ball 20 yards downfield the quarterback needs time bruising a good job by in free knee little corner route excellent job that s what you got to get the ball down i feel a little bit loose that secondary up put them on their heels after the longest gain of the nights and titans <person player="lendale white" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lendale white</person> is the back and the leader in rushing touchdowns of the nfl this year only able to gain a couple of yards guerry bracket made the stop to talk about protecting against frannie protect against anybody only two sacks allowed he was going to ligue 1 every 78 drop back wow that is half the season yes three games it s still sac free having a lot of sack in four plus games no sacks either way here tonight that s a very good offensive line they could run that road grader style theyre athletic and they can pass protect second and eight for <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">collins</person> for both escapes incomplete there s light and slag and they get it state went back to the ball and <person player="melvin bullitt" race="UNK" position="DB">melvin</person> bullet wasnt looking back at all and engaged them and the titans will move closer well <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">kerry collins</person> trying to squeeze that into both scape on that seam around here did a nice job of looking off the safety pump to the right head scape moving up the middle of the field now we got a little little meeting taking place the officials with the conference pass interference defense terminated here she scape going down the seam and clearly there is some contact before the ball gets to bow scape she carried us a nice job iii kind of back shoulders because the safety was still in center field but certainly bullet in really good shape but he made contact before the ball got there at good call well its second year texas a there s a lot of <person player="vince young" race="nonwhite" position="QB">young</person> players on this indianapolis roster out of the gun in the redzone <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">collins</person> and dale <person player="lendale white" race="nonwhite" position="RB">white</person> youre not gonna gain much bracket has been very active he and <person player="freddie keiaho" race="UNK" position="LB">freddie</person> key aho make the tackle nice job by <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">kerry collins</person> <person player="dwight freeney" race="nonwhite" position="DE">dwight freeney</person> one quickly in the early phase the down but <person

was a wily old veteran play he knew what he had he had the men he had the man coverage coming underneath that really was the key there was going to be pressure coming out of carry calls sometimes you have to buy some time you got to buy time when it s going to be pressure you see brad come right up the middle and <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">kerry</person> s face he drifts back drawers rushed him allows the receiver to come back underneath and a terrific job by jones snatching the ball out of here and fighting through the extra yards <person player="lendale

with your experience is there anything that surprises you and he said ive pretty much seen it all there s a certain comfort level a certain peace if you will that i have back there he sees the field with great clarity that really does but this scenario in the field right now if you outweigh their defensive line by 40 pounds up front push you ought to be able to sledgehammer this thing in <person player="lendale white" race="nonwhite" position="RB">white</person> not in not in ruled down shia the going every third and very short and an eightpoint game did he make it you decide all right there s lyndale fighting fighting fighting he s trying to keep his body from hitting the ground remember remember it is where the ball is not where <person player="lendale white" race="nonwhite" position="RB">white</person> is well the ball is in what really is the backhand is he s leaning forward couldnt see the ball to the other shot right here very very close and doesnt look like any part of his body at that point had touched the ground which third and short i dont see ways to challenge their on that <person player="lendale white" race="nonwhite" position="RB">white</person> s pounding to the goal line in touchdown tennessee it looks like the titans are gonna go to to me much too early to go for but then again then again tony you always built for two always real nice job by the

indianapolis should very well be one in five they had a couple of games they pulled out the game if minnesota comes to mind and the game in houston still they are three and three and in position to stay in touch in the division if they get this win tonight second drive to the pole to the second half <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> took them 64 yards

man pretty down good in his situations now the whole play books available to him to get the ball out of his hand a lot quicker hand signal toward <person player="marvin harrison" race="UNK" position="WR">marvin harrison</person> underneath <person player="anthony gonzalez" race="UNK" position="WR">anthony</person> gonzales shy of the first down shy of midfield <person player="vincent fuller" race="nonwhite" position="DB">vincent fuller</person> and a virginia tech has made a couple of big plays tonight including that one to bring down gonzales well that was huge here they were mantoman coverage and hit <person player="vincent fuller" race="nonwhite" position="DB">fuller</person> oneonone against gonzales and he makes a tackle in the open field hopes are going to bring up their offensive personnel and at least show going for it on fourth down suggesting they will try to draw them off solutely yes back until this past quarter the running game has been terrible until the third quarter darrin <person player="darrell reid" race="nonwhite" position="DE">reid</person> defensive lineman comes in as their fullback they run with it they run roads barren road <person player="stephen tulloch" race="UNK" position="LB">stephen</person> tilith middle linebacker led the charge it could be a big momentum swing youll see roads hit it up inside whether the hainsworth and ground inside those tackles they eat up a lot of bodies inside <person player="stephen tulloch" race="UNK" position="LB">stephen</person> toeic number 55 can attack youll see <person player="keith bulluck" race="nonwhite" position="LB">keith</person> s bullet come off the edge just a really good job of firing through the gap by <person player="stephen tulloch" race="UNK" position="LB">stephen</person> tillich and <person player="dominic rhodes" race="UNK" position="RB">rhodes</person> has 17 percent of his carries go for a loss of yardage more than anybody in the nfl who s had 50 carries this year and another one to it that he had taken shot a few titans back to screen it out to the fullback hall got about three yards <person player="melvin bullitt" race="UNK" position="DB">melvin</person> bullet made the tackle but it s worth mentioning this at the last eight times the titans were still in big plays they first of all answered the question could they come back down in the game they hadnt been down in the game they marched the length of the field then they go for two jaws much to your chagrin they make it and they tie the game then when they have to come up with a big defensive stop which has been the trademark all year they do that and as you say mike could be a very big momentum shipper theyve answered question for the last six minutes of the scam second down collin algae coupler was the football out of bounds enough game at about spot first down titans marlon <person player="marlin jackson" race="UNK" position="DB">jackson</person> was not the couple free was there algie <person player="alge crumpler" race="nonwhite" position="TE">crumpler</person> we got to wrap that ball up there s always to defend her from behind marlon jack s permanent strip set pull out fall out what a great play by <person player="marlin jackson" race="UNK" position="DB">jackson</person> fortunately for the titans it went out of bounds the yard games the first down the 34 yard line and well get another play here in the quarter tennessee s gotta watch play clocks down at 7 here now they reset it okay and <person player="jeff saturday" race="white" position="C">jeff</person> fisher s asking on the sidelines when the ball went out of bounds and they had to respond it i think the play clock started at 40 and the officials have a conversation about where the play clock should have been <person player="jeff saturday" race="white" position="C">jeff</person> fischer is on the nfl competition committee he certainly knows every nuance of the rules mike he probably knows the gulf coast like you do terry <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">collins</person> did say that he one of the things he admires about fischer he s never been around a head coach he s had such a good understanding in game situations because that s familiarity through the constitution committee the rookie out of east carolina <person player="chris johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris johnson</person> the back headed up the middle got to the 30yard line and the center kevin will why s it please if you were to come my way down the left sideline i was taking you someplace kid <person player="bob sanders" race="nonwhite" position="DB">bob</person> we go to the fourth quarter will tennessee remain unbeaten all tied at 14 also go to the fourth quarter here in downtown nashville mike tirico tony kornheiser ron jaworski suzy kolber guys interesting how both of these coaches veteran coaches well respected within the league by their peers by their players approaching here tonight with a shift of power potentially for this year in the afc sitting out there <person player="jeff saturday" race="white" position="C">jeff</person> fischer knows that in order to win this division he s got to get past tony dungy and the colts five straight years the colts have won this division and jacksonville locks <person player="adam vinatieri" race="white" position="K">adam</person> and tennessee knocks <person player="adam vinatieri" race="white" position="K">adam</person> and fischer has dungy you would think hed have the advantage he has a home game he s got an undefeated team he s got a you know all the crowd waiting for the knockout blow has not been administered yet in this game has not and both coaches taking a very aggressive approach in this game <person player="jeff saturday" race="white" position="C">jeff</person> fisher going for the twopoint conversion with three minutes left in the third quarter to tie the football game out and agree with it but it worked you see tony dungy on for the one from two horns going for it not getting it i believe it should have punted that football gave the titans a long field of work of give this team a short field plays into there it s an important game in the psyche of both t absolutely theyre rivals in the same division this game means more winning this one right here to both teams than others might think the quarter begins with second and seven and chris jumps in the back that of a gun <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">collins</person> for algae cruller one step from six he heads pump her on the corner out carry just slightly overthrew that ball nonetheless incomplete here s one of those throws i think he likes to put a little more air under it and let him run to it you had the match up yet keauhou on <person player="alge crumpler" race="nonwhite" position="TE">crumpler</person> <person player="alge crumpler" race="nonwhite" position="TE">crumpler</person> ran by him had a chance for six slightly overthrown those of you not with us from the beginning not a strong wide receiving core in tennessee dependable theyve been okay tonight tight ends do a lot of their passing work third and seventh five out in the pattern and <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">collins</person> goes for one of those receivers just engaged didnt catch it no flag from here a field goal is 48 yards with the wind at the back of <person player="rob bironas" race="white" position="K">rob bironas</person> well this ball has to be caught you see the ball right between the 1 and the 2 on just engage in a critical situation latest you have to come up with the football <person player="rob bironas" race="white" position="K">bironas</person> had not missed a kick all year until earlier when he hooked a 43yarder and missed it to the left about the wind it is back and once kicked a 60yard er to beat indianapolis at the gun in 48 titin sweet so the decision by dungey to go for it at midfield essentially cost three points titans on top espn s monday night football is brought you by the sears ultimate football experience soul men starring samuel ljackson and bernie mac in theaters november 7 and nflcom vote for the 2009 pro bowl lat nflcom / pro bowl it s the first monday night

them berlonis will try to kick this one deep into the end zone if that one short and <person player="pierre garcon" race="nonwhite" position="WR">garcon</person> well take it from the five kick returns have been good tonight and the sideline is out of bounds 31 yard line so <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton manning</person> the cokes will take over i dont know who else youd rather have in this situation who s healthy <person player="tom santi" race="white" position="TE">tom</person> brady s not healthy <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton manning</person> is healthy right now and this is what you know what they pay him to do he s the smartest quarterback in the game clearly one of the best quarterbacks in the game and in this circumstance he can quiet a crowd he can lead him on a drive he can score he cant win the game with 14 minutes to go but she can get believe that van terry <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">collins</person> a nice job of bringing titans back they were down eight now theyre that they were up three now it took the <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton manning</person> to see if he can rally the colts down three points of 1440 love the test match injured last drive reti lanes back bottom the screen bannings got time looking deep

position="WR">harrison</person> tonight see payton trying to come back and hit the home run you see <person player="marvin harrison" race="UNK" position="WR">marvin harrison</person> number 88 matched up on top and <person player="nick harper" race="nonwhite" position="DB">nick harper</person> gives that outside move but there s help to the inside that really was the key when you look back to the inside <person player="michael griffin" race="nonwhite" position="DB">michael griffin</person> sitting right there just not the explosion no separation were used to from <person player="marvin harrison" race="UNK" position="WR">harrison</person> lost a step there s no question to that often injury he s 36 dominique the roads maybe a yard <person player="david thornton" race="nonwhite"

clark</person> manny throws to gonzales complete the first down to the 44 yard line first round pick a couple years ago out of ohio state this is really a nice job by <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton manning</person> you see the cradle perfect the throw from steps up avoids the rush and just finds the open receiver <person player="anthony gonzalez" race="UNK" position="WR">anthony</person> gonzales and puts the ball were only gonzales can make the catch really good job <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton</person> driving through that football accurate throw then theyve kept their quarterback clean a couple of hits but no sacks of <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> tonight err again <person player="reggie wayne" race="nonwhite" position="WR">reggie wayne</person> drove courtland <person player="cortland finnegan" race="nonwhite" position="DB">finnegan</person> deep came

position="QB">peyton manning</person> said weve spoiled our fans this three and three is what normal teams go through nobody indianapolis thinks this should happen but <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton manning</person> says this is normal see now i got spoiled by the great to the courts i may run this time with roads to the 36 yard line <person player="keith bulluck" race="nonwhite" position="LB">keith</person> bullock made the tackle on that s part of the beauty of the colts start hitting a couple of these passes and i can run effectively with <person player="dominic rhodes" race="UNK" position="RB">rhodes</person> yeah nice time to spread the field out they go with that quick hitter and right now you know the colts up in this game so far rushed for 82 yards ive only averaged 70 all season long and that little running game inside now has begun to open up the playaction passing game second five roads swinging out of the backfield open field he spun away from the first shot by <person player="nick harper" race="nonwhite" position="DB">nick harper</person> off the corner <person player="david thornton" race="nonwhite" position="LB">david thornton</person> the other former teammate made the tackle will get a third down coming up but a manageable third down that s kind of interesting watching as this game is played out the tennessee defense is pretty much stayed in a single high or three across the board or that two deep shale they have not blitz <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton manning</person> big ol <person player="albert haynesworth" race="nonwhite" position="DT">albert haynesworth</person> sucking air maybe to trying to get to 18 again that s the key rattle number 18 good luck hard to do

race="nonwhite" position="WR">reggie wayne</person> they brought a safety back down inside the double <person player="dallas clark" race="white" position="TE">dallas</person> park mantha gonzales and this was the iceland isolation route to the outside and offending and does a terrific job fifty ones out of mana terry s range theyll go for it again on fourth down <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> s bruised and incomplete <person player="nick harper" race="nonwhite" position="DB">nick harper</person> s seen that a thousand times in practice he did it when it counted for the tight sic and straight drive boats are stopped up fourth down the undefeated titans have the lead of the ball next monday night was the day before election day will be in the

race="white" position="QB">collins</person> of the titans up three take over from their own 34 and throw from most scape great catch by a very improved tight end a 260 not way that wasnt a good catch that was a great catch that ball was behind him and scafe it a tremendous job hell see him fake the block it s against a tub cover two zone he s got bracket inside and watch the released by scape he fakes the block and easy release you see <person player="gary brackett" race="nonwhite" position="LB">brackett</person> trying to pick up look at that throw behind him almost one hand that but his great body control for receiver 6 to 262 pounds g<person player="lendale white" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lendale white</person> s the back another first down throw with the lead this to the fullback ahmad hall take him down in the open field by <person player="melvin bullitt" race="UNK" position="DB">melvin</person> bullock dont gate at three and a half mike heimerdinger the offense port is going crazy with these titans they all is first down passing we thought wed see the power running game two backs to tight end he s open up the playbook there s mike heimerdinger on the sideline he s afraid tony was read his lips and no let s play would be everything does that happen im surprised yes i have a baseball glove in front of his mouth heimerdinger was here with steve mcnair 20022004 stops with the jets in denver before returning here to replace norm chow <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">collins</person> back to the air three on this drive three completions justin mccarran s that catch that karen at ingenix by carrie doing a good job right now of reading they ate in the box that means he s got one on one on the outside he didnt they transferred his own he still has the isolation route outside carrie doing a real good job right here looks on the senator field notice got one on one on the outside delivers a strike i must think he s back with the giants when he had good years nine ten years ago you know you bring up an interesting play here s a guy who has been through so much as somewhat ugly as well he s won divisions with carolina and with the giants was drafted at carolina by bill polian who s the general manager for these colts play clock running down and managing the game well he gets it off to <person player="chris johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris johnson</person> first down and gain and suit you know talk to our colleague trent dilfer last night on the phone about that term game manager cuz we asked <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">kerry</person> this weekend what about that sir you managed the game is it an insult and to carry it is and just some of those guys in this cuz <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton manning</person> you see him back there he s a tag attack but <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">kerry collins</person> a veteran manages the game sometimes the little things jaw is like getting that play off without delay a game those are so important for a quarterback no question about it mike and i think there are game managers i think theyre all good in the nfl but i also derek caretakers and i think that s where the difference the caretaker elmo s take the ball out of his hands the 38 johnson the rookie drops it and it s incomplete it was interesting what <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">kerry collins</person> said that the point of tried was this he doesnt mind being called someone who manages the game but he said if you cant make the throw at third and eight what good does it do you to manage the game so i mean his position was you can call me what you want but i still have to make these throws well it s been taken by some with a real negative tone because it was with trent dilfer and they led the rate he led the ravens to the super bowl whose good running backs to good tight ends somewhat nondescript receiving core kind of like this tennessee team you cant hide your quarterback that s a given on the 38 pressure in his face <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">collins</person> ferry dragging the toes <person player="lavelle hawkins" race="UNK" position="WR">hawkins</person> and a cow well you cant make a better door than <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">kerry collins</person> made right there he didnt like the rules fighting with <person player="dwight freeney" race="nonwhite" position="DE">dwight freeney</person> right in front of me hung in the pocket hung in the pocket son a little move to his left bought a little time and makes a terrific throw to <person player="lavelle hawkins" race="UNK" position="WR">lavelle hawkins</person> on the outside and good job by a rookie to get both feet down goal tree drag the tow outstanding awareness to drill they do every single day at practice i dont tell me you dont like practice i just dont like it with you from the 25 another first down throw in college to front were nine yards second and one this is not what anybody expected to the titans who have thrown 10 more times than they run tonight i dont think you can overstate this enough when indianapolis got the lead and tennessee had to come back they came back they scored they stopped indianapolis twice on fourth down situations mike you talked about momentum shifting it is obvious that a total shift in momentum occurred at that point and theyre throwing the football in first down 14 call passes 10 called runs mendel <person player="lendale white" race="nonwhite" position="RB">white</person> the big bruiser first down titans that the 12 halfway through this final quarter in the titans closing in on respect it gets thrown around all the time disrespect us power rankings blah blah blah yep the titans know that everybody s watching the titans know that there are a bunch of teams that theyve beaten that dont have good records and there are doubters out there and this is their first of many opportunities to prove to people we are one of the elite teams in the hardest to figure nfl weve seen in the last couple of years the 12 <person player="chris johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris johnson</person> see to the 10 inside of seven minutes as we watch <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">kerry collins</person> lead tennessee on one scoring drive before and probably another one here it s interesting to note even at his age he wants to be a starter next year <person player="vince young" race="nonwhite" position="QB">vince young</person> at some point <person player="jeff saturday" race="white"

down that last one they had no other option but to go there youre not going to punt at the plus 3000 absolutely yeah that one at midfield that s the question they they said i believe they should have punted there gave the titans a long field to work with but i could understand the aggressive mentality otomí folks have come out of some holes this year in the regular season late theyll have to do it again here tonight start to the dominica roads ten yard gain on first down well the one thing you can count on <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton manning</person> being and that is patient he knows he s got a lot of time left his football game he wont force his robe <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> for <person player="dallas clark" race="white" position="TE">clark</person> incomplete that s the clock with 4:15 and one of the reasons with those fourth down opportunities <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton</person> was talking to us last night about their offense doesnt get many oppurtunities many possessions that s been the case for years just look at tonight those two touchdowns rise by tennessee took 14 and a half minutes almost a whole crater on those two drives alone second in ten theyre giving them roads in the open field vonn job by <person player="nick harper" race="nonwhite" position="DB">nick harper</person> third down coming up inside of four minutes so as i know you said that <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton manning</person> would be patient and you could count on that but there s no such thing as a tenpoint touchdown you know they have to they have to score twice you cant feed that correct but now is in situations that be a little more aggressive <person player="albert haynesworth" race="nonwhite" position="DT">haynesworth</person> coming in <person player="peyton manning" race="white"

position="DB">chris hope</person> right there to make a play this is what s happening here mike talked at the beginning of the show about that guy who beats in golf beats you in tennis your older brother you cant get past them this is the slaying of the dragon within this division this is what tennessee has done by finally beating indianapolis in a totally meaningful game to them and they rallied from down 14 to 6 to get it done you can see the quickness to speed the acceleration of <person player="chris johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris johnson</person> there s just a little seam a crack and watch him dart through there i love the calmness with which he runs the helmet steady the shoulders steady but boy those legs are moving fast real happy through a shoe on the way and see those blocks to <person player="david stewart" race="nonwhite" position="OT">david stewart</person> that right tackle very unheralded offensive line but a quality job again tonight algie <person player="alge crumpler" race="nonwhite" position="TE">crumpler</person> left tennessee sight lead by 17 heaven will why is the one enjoying in a moment what a terrific guy bolts arent used to this obviously being three and four and losing by this many points but that man <person player="jeff saturday" race="white" position="C">jeff</person> fisher he made the bold move when <person player="vince young" race="nonwhite" position="QB">vince young</person> got hurt he said we are going with terry <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">collins</person> until further notice a lot of people said what are you doing is this the right way to go terry <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">collins</person> is now going to be six and oh and his starts the tennessee titans are going to be seven and oh in their starts everything that could have been asked of them has been answered tonight they fell behind they caught up they went for two they stopped the great pope s offense on fourth down twice and theyre stretching it out right now you can hear you can hear this franchise this whole area come to life because finally there are no doubts about the tennessee titans right now and the move to get terry <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">collins</person> nobody s going to say a word about that nobody s saying

think of him people around the league here s <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">kerry collins</person> the quarterback talking about the key to fisher s longevity i think guys love playing for him and you know he s been able to win i mean that s what he s consistently done over the years and he s uh he s a great football coach i mean he understands the game as well as any coach ive been around and it s a great motivator to say guys fifty years old he s in the middle of the age bracket for nfl head coaches theyve been doing this in one job longer than anyone <person player="dallas clark" race="white" position="TE">dallas clark</person> now the sidelines just just that stretch tony remember the stretch when they moved from houston that would have aged any any guy and he had to go four different stadiums in four years out of trailers no fancyschmancy training complex like every team has playing in memphis playing at vanderbilt crosstown here to this stadium opened up <person player="chad simpson" race="UNK" position="RB">chad simpson</person> a run here to the 44 and then the year this stadium opened up the year they finally had a training facility a home base that was the year it all took off and mcnair and george and wycheck all part of the run to the super bowl to that point by the way if <person player="jeff saturday" race="white" position="C">jeff</person> fisher announced tomorrow wanted to coach somewhere else thatd be a line around the block but he s always wanted to coach here he stayed with this team through all that then through the good times and bad times followed the good times as they had no money and the team deteriorated and now in a fairly short time he s brought them back and and but adams stayed with him he knew there was going to be that downturn when they had to lose their ageing expensive players and but adams heading out right now im gonna celebrate this victory as i pointed out but original afl owner me and ralph wilson the two so big a part of the anthills beginning still in those positions <person player="william hayes" race="nonwhite" position="DE">william hayes</person> deflected that pass for <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> and it was incomplete and tony maybe was my favorites last year yeah jaws was last year we were visiting with <person player="jeff saturday" race="white" position="C">jeff</person> fisher and he talked about staying in tennessee and he said there s great pride in the fact that all of his kids went through the same school district in the same schools very atypical alone nomadic life of nfl coaches and this is a great football town they love their football magic last three days they were all lathered up about this game very excited theyre still on their feet here <person player="chad simpson" race="UNK" position="RB">chad simpson</person> to the 36 two and a half to go 25 straight points scored by the titans for doubt 14 6 gonzales gets to the sideline i mean you talk about the fact that it s a really good football town it s also a small team and for them to have a team competing for a championship for them to be on a nationally televised stage for them to do well of a national televised state gives a little bit more pride for everybody else it s not in new york so that s acog oh it s not you know it s not a big city this is what theyve got in sports come on they had our picture up in the middle of town that goes our show you must be real small that was scary oh that s a sin city of predators the only other sports indeed national hockey league team plays downtown van der rohe here but it is a all tighten town no doubt about it <person player="dallas clark" race="white" position="TE">dallas clark</person> shy of the 15 see if they get one more in before the twominute warning and the other side of the tool talk about tennis the indianapolis and what they face at three and four we check down <person player="chad simpson" race="UNK" position="RB">simpson</person> they really like the speed and what this guy gives them maybe right is the first down line as we get to a buck fifty five twominute warning in music city where theyre rockin and rollin and undefeated and the champagne is still on ice for the $72 it s a good week <person player="david stewart" race="nonwhite" position="OT">stewart</person> westbrook over 200 total yards for the eagles the whole nfc east over 500 the whole nfc south 500 or better a lot of good teams over in the nfc and meantime over here in the afc we have past the conference four and three or three and four and the culture in that group tennessee s going to hit the pillow tonight with a four game lead in the division domonique roads the back <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">manning</person> throws to hims is tackled at the by <person player="david thornton" race="nonwhite" position="LB">david thornton</person> if you say tennessee s gonna hit the pillow happy indianapolis has new england that pittsburgh got san diego their next string goes in tough game wow roads have ball shy of the goal on it was importance tackled so see if <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton</person> press would sneak this one in he does and a rushing touchdown <person player="peyton manning" race="white" position="QB">peyton</person> s first of the year 31 20 know that i watch way too much stuff ah phil sneak wedge left just move jaws are called tonight so finitary will kick and then well get an onside kick attempt with a buck 17 to go 31:21 so tennessee sitting at 6:00 and oh the wind tonight we get into seven oh that s too clear of buffalo which lost yesterday new england which one and well play the colts in indianapolis next sunday night the steelers we will see next monday night in washington and then then all the four and three jets baltimore denver and then like half the world and three and four miami and cleveland and jacksonville and houston and it will be indianapolis barring a miracle here in the last buck 17 so as dire as it feels within the division and as bad as it looks at three and four there s still contact us that people are going to get in the playoffs well the great rationale is that the new york giants and the pittsburgh steelers twice in the last three years have been wildcard teams that have gone on the road and theyve won the super bowl and you hear everyone say that this is not the end for us because if we can just get in the tournament weve got a chance to win it but we saw tonight exactly what <person player="jeff saturday" race="white" position="C">jeff</person> fisher s defensive coordinator <person player="jim sorgi" race="white" position="QB">jim</person> schwartz was telling us on <person player="jeff saturday" race="white" position="C">saturday</person> the coach of hitting i hate to use the baseball analogy there hitting foul balls right and theyre just missing a foul pole you know off <person player="dallas clark" race="white" position="TE">dallas clark</person> s hands just shy of <person player="marvin harrison" race="UNK" position="WR">marvin harrison</person> here s an onside kick anticipated onside kicks two of 18 success rate this year that was touched before it went 10 yards so belonged to tennessee yeah the load of the popup kick could only went about seven yards before cole touched it tennessee ball and they recovered it anyway a little victory formation the last play of practice the last play of the workweek for the titans that s playing football right here so john i just youve seen him on film seen with your own eyes here tonight kent indianapolis dig out of it with what tony said that tough schedule coming yeah i believe they can i believe they can challenge through the wildcard spot things with you ive been very impressed with tennessee the way they came back to this football game to meet they answered the bell falling behind the occasionally touched by the kicker before he went ten yards tennessee recovered the ball five yards from the end to the end of the run this down and they showed they can throw the football that was the one question mark and i had i think people around the country have we know they could play defense we know they could run the football can they throw the ball down the field effect through the first half oz laurie the second half <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">kerry collins</person> heated up started attacking down the field and they were very efficient and effective doing it mike mccarthy and the packers come down here on sunday and then to chicago to take on the bears in jacksonville every game of this division has been tough this continues to be a good division and then theyll see brett in the jets and then after that it s thanksgiving in detroit against the lions so couple tough ones here but tennessee there is no murderers row set up right now unless you play in the nfc stand there both next three games a pretty tough guy there were no guineas in there when you look at the back end of it and there s and i said they were the washington at <person player="dallas clark" race="white" position="TE">dallas</person> yeah the giants yeah but but their last two for example their last two tennessee s is pittsburgh and out in yep that s it that s a tough way to go tony dungy had said of this game that it was very very important to the postseason <person player="jeff saturday" race="white" position="C">jeff</person> fischer was not going to say the same thing to tennessee because as he told us if i tell him it s for the season and we lose what do i tell him on tuesday well now he can tell about tuesday congratulations some familiar faces with the long faces were not used to seeing no theyve gone through full seasons not seeing four losses terry <person player="kerry collins" race="white" position="QB">collins</person> you know what managed the games not a derogatory term when he do it the way he did that second half four full possessions they scored on each one of them and a lot of respect both coaches both quarterbacks these two teams see each other as mentioned on the last sunday of the season in indianapolis 3121 the last of the unbeaten stays that way tennessee 7 a note to clear everybody in the afc full recap for this game coming up on sportscenter snooty menemen all the guy with that suspended world series game on monday
