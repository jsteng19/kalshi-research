they havent been able to run the ball well the problem is curve down they cant hit third and medium a third and long but their game plans simple tonight running game keep the ball away from the running shoot of maryland win the ball control contest and also no turnovers because maryland keeps going to think they think why they ever bought in the pull back and go with three wideouts including people for contact with <person player="lamont gore" race="UNK" position="DB">lamont</person> for the free safety it looked like it was unintentional but their feet were tangle up when we were in here to do the virginia game a couple years ago you were talked about daring steagle what a great prospect he was he s going to run a corner round just gets tripped up bottle of mine cork but there s going to be about three or four chances in this ball game tonight where he s going to get a bigtime play and he could turn it into seven points but he has that kind of ability missed the last seven games last season because of a broken arm but he is a bigtime player and theyll march off the interference call down to the maryland 47 yard line watching georgia tech s practice tuesday they were sharp and practicing it when you look at a practice that s what you want to see a good concentration so i expect them to play a good ball game tonight<person player="donnie davis" race="UNK" position="QB">donnie davis</person>has been working hard not to concentrate on that first receiver to be able to walk we know detailoriented if i gotta suggest to the 45yard line talking about<person player="donnie davis" race="UNK" position="QB">donnie davis</person>the quarter met he needs the running game because he s a quarterback that likes to operate on the corner he s got good speed he s a good roll out quarterback runs the option very well he was a running shoot quarterback in high school actually came up high school same time eric desire his shooters it was rated by many as benefit was to her for nearly five marilyn comes with the flitz quick set middle to make suspect he s wrapped up on a hurry at supporting one the corner aj johnson who has four picks this year came up to make the tackle on<person player="harvey middleton" race="UNK" position="WR">harvey middleton</person>and he got those records in high school in the running shoot offense so he s going to be looking or deal the field here at maryland said well that s my offense there he almost went to houston because houston was running the runandshoot he looked at illinois with john mackovic that decided on georgia tech it doesnt have the big arm and i think that s why your point that if you get him in third and eight third and 9 youve got an abandoned we have a definite advantage third and four years ago with dj sinister moniker and johnson to the 39 maybe the 38 yard line that s at least a yard shy ratcliffe <person player="ratcliff thomas" race="UNK" position="LB">thomas</person> one of the inside

couple of bold teams at louisville had another one i believe was nine and two or ten and one or nine and one they didnt get to go to a bowl because the school of lost money of the year before a bowl game and they said no as you got the great record but youre not going and lee wasnt offering any money to help him go believes a good football coach he did a great job at louisville for the clerical job indiana half the length to the ball of the first down for george oleary guys talking about both these teams being fragile mike they both have had losing years and even though maryland s four knows

with yards short of a first down some very innovative place stop it they really do and a lot of screens a lot of running plays out of the shotgun but what they try to do maryland has put three

please stop short of the first half think where they got the spot it s gonna be real close by the what what maryland s trying to do is one of the criticisms of the run shoot is the fact that you spread out and you dont really have a compass or 30 shorter inside the tenyard lines they bring in two defensive linemen at the tight end get the ball to <person player="buddy rodgers" race="UNK" position="RB">buddy</person> rogers to try to pick up the first down all <person player="buddy rodgers" race="UNK" position="RB">buddy</person> rogers got a great spot out of that he never got past

of avoiding the contact with the right hand oh that s great good job by me from campbell so third and ten for maryland in the sack crowd really into it now very well a lot of it sorts of funny the only gana perriman makes another tackle and georgia tech defenses look superb it has bike and now you start to wonder about scott mironovich is he pressing or offensively are they all person to try to

plane but still ross was here back in october of 89 he began the year oh and three but he had a week off prior to playing maryland and one ross kid who had his offensive coaches kalsa be fancy had his defensive coaches scout the offense and that s exactly what oleary to this week that work they found the tennessee s in fact the rest of history ross s team won several laughs eight and twenty on the next twentyone in route to a national championship the next year jerry george oleary has a very good reputation this business he is a smart coach you saw the official point the wrong way on the interference call it was against maryland right now everything georgia tech is doing everywhere theyve got on a roll a lot of confidence early in this ballgame michael seaver number 65 there s a blocker that was able to spring<person player="cj williams" race="UNK" position="RB">cj williams</person>but youre right theyre in a good rhythm right now theyre throwing the ball in first down to coming back and running it successfully on second down theyre not in third long yardage situation and the officials want to measure to see if it s a first down up at the 37 we have 12 32 to go first half back to you george oleary for a second when we talked to him the other day asking him about the difference in college and pro coaching he says the best two jobs in football are being a backup quarterback and an assistant coach and a pros if youre winning but i think he liked it here through i think he enjoys being a head coach he took over for a very good football coach bill <person player="jermaine lewis" race="nonwhite" position="WR">lewis</person> yes all the game in here last year the arizona game where they had arizona beat and if they would have won that game you dont know what would have happened here total yards tonight georgia tech completely dominating maryland and this is an offense that can rack up yards and huge chunks maryland they range across grace tackle by shot got a guy out here that can fly and you have to make the top tackles and scott is a very physical corner big gets that one 196 and he s a transfer from thousand stadia sighs he can run and he can cover and he singled out here with a very good athlete derek segal but he makes the tackle a real good play by<person player="chad scott" race="UNK" position="DB">chad scott</person>had to talk his

seagal it s quicker than any of those three we talked to you this past spring get this out at 415 seconds in the 40yard a <person player="gary joseph" race="UNK" position="DB">gary</person> dunn go over and tell a maryland defensive back be that fast scaring the death they look a good protection cant find anybody has to scramble knocked out of bounds at the 46 yard line ow <person player="al wallace" race="UNK" position="DL">wallace</person> was the man who prevented him from getting the first down outlaws with a big play because it kept me from get the first down they forced the pond here by georgia tech dining gave us back to throw everybody s covered he almost let that ball go were pressuring him good locked out wall 56 it will bring down just inside though so he couldnt get the first down <person player="al wallace" race="UNK" position="DL">wallace</person> a very quick 244 pounds and <person player="keith brookings" race="UNK" position="LB">keith</person> weaver is

call this one off or not milk so marilyn gets a break here a little push right there but he still cookie <person player="kofi smith" race="UNK" position="DB">smith</person> still too tight like this a big series for scott milanovic oh it s huge i think mic down 10 nothing the offense has not been able to do one thing they havent run the ball at all milan events has had a good completion percentage but not for many yards georgia tech on top of undefeated 17th ranked maryland 10 to nothing the terps have the ball at their own 18 yard line the numbers on scott solana vision his debut this season 5 out of 7 47 yards and a touchdown you see an intercept for longer fingers under a little suspect and excellent job by georgia tech defense line sort came up busted up the timing in the plane they got help from karen let s go to jerry punch guy that s the previous offensive possession stalk milanovic came off the field was the into the finishing set right on the very end of the offensive bench while<person player="brian cummings" race="UNK" position="QB">brian cummings</person>the backup quarterback will go to right in the middle surrounded by wide receivers talking about a route talk about what he was seeing downfield milanovic off to one side hasnt been a part of this football team for four games having a tough time being a part of it tonight all right thank you jerry that s very interesting to talk to mike jeffery about that warm place playaction milanovic on the run least the past short game <person player="bruce james" race="UNK" position="WR">bruce</person> jeans mic either you want your starter doing what the backup is doing around i want him in the ball game and i saw him in the huddle here he s a little more animated in this in this huddle that when you start this serious but scott milan of his pride feels like he s on trial a little bit right now missed the first four ballgames all of a sudden youre four and owen if it aint broken dont fix it killed saying but he believes he s the best quarterback now he and <person player="mark motley" race="UNK" position="OL">mark</person> tucker believes he s the best in chemistry a brian s coming from scallops and they were four know under what a little double pack roger waiting for me cuz a nice staff to get away from logic but herriman pushes him out of bounds the 39 yard line the return of milanovic prompted this terps dilemma but by the overall number comparison <person player="brian cummings" race="UNK" position="QB">cummings</person> doesnt have quite as good a numbers in completion percentage yards per game in touchdowns it s almost two to one yet there are some people who believe the only number worth looking at is the one that says fourandoh for coming but that s unfair to look at that because god mallanna bitch was doing a lot of that in a rebuilding time thank the reverse milanovic for the makin reverse forget at the 40yard line ryan sort wasnt fine see this is the difference in both quarterbacks brian s cummins is more of an athlete better foot speed then scott mallanna ditch has he the first floor of all games was able to get outside good faith mustafa hobbits that just on the speed to get by<person player="ryan stewart" race="UNK" position="DB">ryan stewart</person>and those people who say<person player="brian cummings" race="UNK" position="QB">brian

midfield nice throw to<person player="walt williams" race="UNK" position="WR">walt williams</person>gain of 10 and you have to make a tough decision like that you want the players to pie into it also because you want your players they have to believe in your quarterback scott mallanna determine a good throw to wall dreams that s why i said this is probably the most important theory he s had as the quarterback of maryland as<person player="brian cummings" race="UNK" position="QB">brian cummings</person>platform that this is an important period he needs to get points on the board now is the best throw the night should be unloaded that thing out of the quest year another first down <person player="nathan perryman" race="UNK" position="DB">nathan</person> jeremy made the tackle again the alltime leader in catches yards and touchdown he was suspended for the first game was<person player="jermaine lewis" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jermaine lewis</person>where his involved in the gambling the same as a lot of it by putting scott milanovic in the shotgun that gives it a little bit longer time to throw it gets a better view of the defense and really wears down the georgia tech truck trying to chase the hit to him on the pass rush <person player="buddy rodgers" race="UNK" position="RB">buddy</person> rogers the single setback as they say in the run with your former theater formation a lot of exchanging applause wants to scream <person player="jermaine lewis" race="nonwhite" position="WR">lewis</person> on the flankers screen and once out by<person player="al jackson" race="UNK" position="DL">al jackson</person>he peels back from his nose tackle spot get some help from brooking and makes the tackle what georgia tech s trying to do on defense is just proud with their defensive with their linebackers and defensive back not to give scott a lot of it s a chance to draw a bead on it and see the linebackers move in late he checks off to the screen pass to<person player="jermaine lewis" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jermaine lewis</person>is able to pick up the first down get calm ive gotten a lot of it inside there whether he wants with one world georgia tech cleaning up they come with a blip one of its pull down to the 25 maybe the 20 fully yard lock the gambled and lost on that with a hefty played by scott milanovic who is he looks over the defense he s going to see this backer come in to make a blitz and he s just going to throw a quick hitch to<person player="jermaine lewis" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jermaine lewis</person>from the outside where he s lined up in the shotgun they have a tough time getting there on that plus mentor main look turns it into a lot of yards that s the danger of the run and shoot with those receivers rogers knife picked up on the blue collar lon over the middle here or sign inside the can first and goal there s a flag down white back the line of scrimmage and this one will come back you imagine the pressure that s going to strike milanovic just to get being gettin in the end zone he can relax him he can be the quarterback and he could take over the offense and he s back but he needs points on this drive he s 11 out of 13 98 yards he s hit his last seven passes but that interception is the number that stands out right now first and 15 after the procedure phone with quarterback draw and there is another play more suited to brian coming through a part of it more you beat a bride coming to what erin does on that play just puts all five receivers they spread out there s nobody in the backfield as an instance set trying to get the defense to move out with a wide receivers and capture the quarterback draw but nothing there gain of three at second and 12 coming birthday is saturday by the way the young man who last year s number everything julliard yarder drop at 4 oclock stop by <person player="jimmy clements" race="UNK" position="LB">jimmy</person> comments the outside linebacker 6:3 jr we with the safety last year before this season the improving coaches brian <person player="henry baker" race="UNK" position="DB">baker</person> the defense court nurses good in space he lost the blitz then he comes got muhammad never seasoned in time ceaseless they had last time if he picks up they fail to pick it up this time it really mixed it up well makes it third and 19 for the turf i get the ball field approval computer number four instruct your officials looking at each other waiting for the other foot touchdown wow and finally they market at the one inch line great route by<person player="jermaine lewis" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jermaine lewis</person>he made it look like he was going to run a street route and then he ran a deep comeback and because gotten a lot of the chance of strong arm he s able to get the ball out there and then to miss tackle by<person player="nick ferguson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">nick ferguson</person>jermaine <person player="jermaine lewis" race="nonwhite" position="WR">lewis</person> close to that goal line 33 yards on third and 18 they score here youre going to see a very relieved scott for a lot of it and a very relieved <person player="mark motley" race="UNK" position="OL">mark</person> duffner ert people to fly down may have been movement big mistake by maryland mike they ran in the short yardage offense again to the question on the running shoe toys when you get inside the 10yard line or short yardage is it tough enough here you see the configuration of the running shoe four wide receivers one back in the backfield now a start yarding do you want to come in with this black thunder they bring two defensive linemen in it to bring a different quarterback in three running back to try to give them that toughness that they needed for yardage one of the running backs is the linebacker another is a former linebacker now they put the runandshoot back on the field with <person player="buddy rodgers" race="UNK" position="RB">rodgers</person> to set back so first and goal now from the five after yard no more weird effect has proven very difficult to run against this has been the big difference in this maryland football team tonight and in the previous four ballgames they wanted just inability to run the football tonight now where the running suit is dangerous looks like theyre bringing in the pipe set again here comes our lando s crozier in number seven going to try to knock it in but where you have to worry now if your georgia tech dont buy into that fact that this is a ryan formation they put throw the ball out of it brogre actually won the tulane game when <person player="brian cummings" race="UNK" position="QB">cummings</person> with her and he threw the ball 7 times people to do that he could good luck give it to ruckus play up the middle and he<person player="patrick bradford" race="UNK" position="DL">patrick bradford</person>number 79 the first man to hit him and they just swarmed in the middle of the d5 we got to figure the running shoots coming back in third down and suggesting the game by both coordinators here comes all the defensive back from georgia tech into the game here comes all the wide receivers from maryland and florida maryland has a net two yards running coming into the team they averaged nearly a hundred eighty eight contests and go first came summer a lot of this want the time out to talk about it the play clock was down to 1 321 to go first half of play georgia tech lament and nothing leave 3:21 to go first half to play marilyn knocking on georgia tech s door down and nothing this drive has already gone 77 yards to the last five all the ones that are really important for the terrible your main hands up in battle in the way they were trying for that blank screen again to<person player="jermaine lewis" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jermaine lewis</person>my mouth uses hands he s 6 foot 5 261 pounds table is like that path let s go to jerry ponch dr condon is a remarkable emphasis in georgia tech davison foot for this year in fact against arizona they held arizona just warren course down the whole first half and 13 early on russia s incredible theyre doing a wonderful job again tonight marilyn comes on to the field goal for joe donald from 22 yards he s five out of six on the year accurate it s got a lot of it is his first courting drive of the season but a great defense they invite you a detective coming up saturday college football on the espn to brigham young colorado state byu has been the perennial wac power but the rams are the reigning champions they kick it off at 2:00 eastern then is 5/4 night saturday college football edition it took a bit on all the score <person player="gary joseph" race="UNK" position="DB">gary</person> was talking about the arizona game that georgia tech lost they had a big lead going to the fourth quarter had a punt blocking when youre trying to rebuild a program sometimes when things get a little tight and you make some mistakes that s when you start to unravel on both these teams as i said before are fragile teams that they dont understand yet totally how to win and keep it going maryland s a little closer georgia tech but they need good things to happen that big turnover so far georgia tech s been able to avoid their turnover george oleary trying to get that first win over a division one team in a year and a half the scoring drive took nearly eight minutes off the clock they only get a bigger goal out of it now the very dangerous derek siegel is back with charlie rogers last year stable led the nation in germany led the a kickoff for derek cable in july and flank will get it was part of the tackle out at the 24 let s go to chris fowler chris oh mike at halftime well have the story of suspensions at usc a potentially very damaging blow to the championship hopes of the trojans plus a violent day in the pennant races well have highlights as leading trades on me also the blitz coming up at halftime <person player="mark motley" race="UNK" position="OL">mark</person> chris thanks very much that s a report of an agent may

complete absolutely this one is incomplete outofbounds they fell says it s colleges problem that theyve have apart the hard time but you get 125 players knowing where theyre at all the time but i

middle of this football team once again now he is a member of the maryland therapist that driving when you have success and you get your team the end zone and they have had a touchdown then they have the five yard penalty down there they were close to get the score burton go for an inch away penalty girls killed the yellow jeff williams perfect single look out when a caller good block they will

who was averaged 140 yards a game rushing this year and in this nine game career as a tailback has an average 102 yards a game must be subbed in the water in georgia because robert edwards moved from the defensive back at the university of georgia was off to a great career before he was hurt the tennessee game aj johnson just misses the tackle on<person player="cj williams" race="UNK" position="RB">cj williams</person>it stays throwing the diving <person player="donnie davis" race="UNK" position="QB">davis</person> miss tackle by maryland williams the first guard off the bench to

just overthrowing center exactly had a lot of room to run if donny <person player="donnie davis" race="UNK" position="QB">davis</person> would have chose to run 147 to go first half georgia tech 84 yards rushing 84 yards and tonight good balanced cat watching the offensive line coach in offense report and a quick play call in here the first half theyll be sent off oh all the blood coming cant go up and get it scott was there as we mentioned williams a twosport athlete hit two threepointers late against north carolina state to lead the yellow jackets to a comeback victory hed another comeback with his outside shooting he was a very valuable member of that team wasnt afraid to take the big shot but george oleary came in and announced nobody plays any field into playing with that basketball season will be a little different modern rivers long bobby pin is remember you get recruited yep <person player="donnie davis" race="UNK" position="QB">davis</person> again with nine dollars single little nightcap now paces and call me walk he knew that the finger was about three yards away make sure you support him derek <person player="derrick steagall" race="UNK" position="WR">steagall</person> number nine the outside receiver running to come back knows where the chains are at now that weights on the football is able to get his feet in bounce for the first

of a yard clock running 126 left in the half another good drive by georgia tech keeping the ball away from in maryland offense each team with two timeouts left zachary and steagle will be the white out find the ball again in the life i see tell your receivers to get their head around and cried a little gate the football pepper exactly can see the football was able to give me head around and find it for the touchdown now youre saying that they cannot penalize the home team here they can totally warn them i think they warned them after the first demonstration with all the mats coming out all the seat cushions and i think theyll get them for delay of game here fifth im forcing light feeling good really on the kickoff not just the lay of game that sons report something like conduct if it s been a big one and that s big against the runandshoot because still there s fifty seconds of two timeouts left and if these fans throw anything on the field after the coaching staff will be going up to fans africa well that may be maryland fans throwing him out there brad chambers comes on for the point after and more people throwing things on the field jorge is saying that cocaine go get those things get them out of here there s 6,000 of them coming out on the field the extra point makes it 17 sir no good and a 163 with 50 seconds left to go in the first half and now well see the

georgia tech we missed the extra point after this delay took a little time there the missed the extra point now they get the penalty on the kickoff so marilyn has to make the fans pay coming up at halftime chris fowler lee corso <person player="craig fitzgerald" race="UNK" position="TE">craig</person> <person player="bruce james" race="UNK" position="WR">james</person> with the update on the real bad news for southern cal encounter robinson our hidden video the amazing plays from last weekend he didnt see that s fun and a halftime blitz well go around the country let s go to jerry punch doctor where he had whistled is totally my festive marilyn had the option of taking an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty on the pap or on the ticked off and we would often take it on the kickoff things get better field position and maybe have a chance to distant points in the final 15 seconds all right thanks jerry once you go up in the stands and collect some of those seat cushions they go home with you now somebody else already is those secret support darrin stephens again chants got jonathan johnson will be deep on the kick off for break they have to kick off and play yard line got food all the way up to the 25 nice covered by georgia tech they stopped with the 39 so it wasnt nearly as bad as it could have been mike sheridan down to make the tackle this is a seat cushion drive right here now this is this one s for the seat cushions because scott milanovic has to be able to use this time 45 seconds with his nohuddle and the two time us get points on the board for maryland knew timeouts left of the terps the numbers on the on of it remember the lapses that weve gotten down to the one of the few go laugh repellent georgia tech comes on the blitz again milanovic nice touch over the middle got to make the grab of 47 yard lights gives me robert made the grab at the 47 yard line and maryland will use one of its two timeouts nice patient by milanovic and nice touch on to the throw 36 seconds to go in the half back in a moment will this be the seat cushion incident in atlanta or not you see those the little people there dont have strong enough arms to hit it on the field so theyre holding on to there s george detectives anything is good on that into the field or they keep an eye on the folks that have them still trying to get points last 36 seconds oh man especially one of the mr maine mild gets his second sack of the year the third sack by georgia tech tonight he beats a block of<person player="pat ward" race="UNK" position="OL">pat ward</person>the offensive guard<person player="jermaine miles" race="UNK" position="DL">jermaine miles</person>is having a pretty good first half rushing the passer able on a on a twists stunt evil come inside and get ahead of<person player="pat ward" race="UNK" position="OL">pat ward</person>beat him on the block he pre stopped mallanna s could not throw the ball away when nice technique by <person player="jermaine miles" race="UNK" position="DL">miles</person> he was about to go for a pokey go for a fake he went for the body maryland uses this last timeout with 30 seconds to go in the half another great day of college football this saturday capped off by a battle of top 10 teams colorado against howard schnellenberger and oklahoma coach quarterbacks in position to watch in this game well really is you got the backup quarterback to colorado and hassler who did such a great job of moving around the pocket and finding the open receiver against texas a&amp;m hopeful all the place to quarterback derek moore here the left hander and derrick mckey at junior college or the transfer from arizona state so it quarterback night for that ball game and a perfect finish another big day and night of pallet football third and ten from maryland last equation from maryland to the top of your screen whooping that one throwing for louis contacts no flag is perriman and loosed after feet tangle up and away pretty good coverage good coverage by <person player="nathan perryman" race="UNK" position="DB">nathan</person> perriman rinsing stride by stride stride with<person player="jermaine lewis" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jermaine lewis</person>and maryland will have to kick it away with 23 seconds to go in the half oc pushing he did the mouth anything although they missed the next reporting a flow below so a lot of it will punt with him back there always the danger of a fake of course but probably not with 23 seconds to go on a hand corner tonight was back there beautiful kiss time by milanovic family from your 15 and went down on one knee clock will stop at 14 seconds our doorman 45 yard kick no return we talked about georgia tech s balanced offense maryland has 139 yards passing eight rushing then the big difference in the first four ballgames they ran the ball very effectively georgia tech taking that away the night and you have the feeling with george oleary being a defensive oriented coach if the last 14 saying this half will be spent on one knee or at least with some kind of a safe blood combined the tight formation the protection formation johnny <person player="donnie davis" race="UNK" position="QB">davis</person> takes a knee and that s that nice going for georgia tech a theme that have lost 13 great days to division a lot of comments maryland comes in undefeated but at the end of the half it s georgia tech on top of the turf 16 3 at home let s go to chris fowler chris mike a maryland team averaging 33 points a game so far there s three 1/2 time under scott milanovic coming up a story and reaction at usc where the trojans have been hit by suspensions that plus the pennant race update and of course the halftime blitz is coach dan <person player="craig fitzgerald" race="UNK" position="TE">craig</person> doing me come enough for halftime in atlanta georgia tech leading maryland 16 to 3 welcome back to bobby dodd stadium mike <person player="patrick bradford" race="UNK" position="DL">patrick</person> my god for jerry punch down on the field with us we talked about scott milanovic the beginning of the broadcast how would you evaluate his first half performance after coming off the fourgame suspension well i think early in the game he was prescient he threw the interception youre going to see it right here where he tries to go downtown tried to get the easy score just gets a picked off but other than that i think he s played very well here johnny <person player="donnie davis" race="UNK" position="QB">davis</person> to factors such as zachary with a big time test for the touchdown in this case the 53 leads i think scott milanovic settled down a little bit that last drive what his fault they had the penalty down at the goal line had to settle for three i think that was one of the big plays in the game that fiveyard penalty where the halftime stats maryland eight rushing and pulling the sacks and they came into the game tonight averaging 117 our 79 yards rushing tonight they got a minus eight that s been the big difference the other thing is georgia tech no turnovers and only two penalties so theyre playing air free on their side of the ball and maryland has feasted off of turnovers in their opening four games the defense has come up with 16 in the four games the numbers on milanovic steagle and rogers deep to receive at georgia tech well get the ball first nice kick by oconnell puts in seven yards deep what goes jerry part doctor guys could use a lot of adjectives the scribe marilyn head coach <person player="mark motley" race="UNK" position="OL">mark</person> duffner but unemotional isnt one of them he s a very emotional coach and here in their locker but has something to guys is something we havent had happened this year we are behind at half time now all you guys join hands they all join hands running the circles to the second half were not going to win this ballgame offensively we have to win it with our defense they want to try to keep the football and keep our offense off the field weve got to stop them defensively and give our office a chance to get us of course were going to win the ballgame with defense a very emotional <person player="mark motley" race="UNK" position="OL">mark</person> duster here at halftime all right jerry nothing is exactly right to your<person

a very good job theyre fairly missed everything and rolling again me off to a pool of those start just has been a tough evening for a short time of practice but stuff jerry might be right he said his defense can just hold georgia tech and put the ball back in his own both of these coaches did not have overwhelming talent in the work with tough to raise it up from virtually nothing williams will get the first down to be partner for 30 and you can give a lot of credit in the first half to georgia tech s offensive line they just continue to win that battle at the line of scrimmage<person

turnover for maryland doesnt look like the ball ever gets up to his hands i dont know if he pulled out too soon or the center eric green stein just didnt get it up he s broken with the recovery number 35 looked like he was distracted by the blitz big break for georgia tech at the maryland 24 another block downfield my seagull these wide receiver poking down fiddling stick some butter but derrick steagle just really collision the defensive back on that play you like to get those opportunities of blindside hits i think it s on derrick <person player="darrick rather" race="UNK" position="DB">rather</person> number 11 derrick <person player="darrick rather" race="UNK" position="DB">rather</person> just gets picked up by derrick spiegel and you like those shots and theyre not

recruit a fullback a two i pull back and left draws <person player="charles wiley" race="UNK" position="RB">wiley</person> go back to the tailback spot who s fighting and along your nowhere near getting it aj johnson came in from the corner behind the blocking to help out out to tackle the fishes down the toys are wearing it would have run that play in a phone booth because everybody was so tight all 22 were right in the picture no indication from the sideline that georgia tech is going to send on the field goal team and that s what maryland has been able to do all year but they gave up to tonight and now here comes the field goal team light but you got to take the field goal because the field goal put you it can make it in pretty good shape 16 ahead breaks will come on to try the field goal six out of seven this year and 2 for 2 from this distance they already hit a 37 yarder this is the 32 we missed it georgia tech can take advantage of the fumble recovery and a 32yard field goal goes wide right 1046 to go third quarter welcome back to bobby dodd stadium here in atlanta our 416 is green georgia tech up in the third quarter in keeping with our usual thursday night ritual we have another undefeated division one college football coach the unbeaten is 3rd ranked florida gators head coach <person player="steve jackson" race="UNK" position="OL">steve</person> spurrier joining us and coach theyre going to ask you gotta sympathize with parked up to this week and tough to figure this quarterback you gotta love talented quarterback how do you keep everyone happy youve been able to do it well dr punch i dont know if you keep everybody happy but there s a third i think are you player out there that you think and help your team win the game and i think that s what marks and roger is tonight maryland will start from its own 20 after the missed field goal and <person player="steve jackson" race="UNK" position="OL">steve</person> has agreed to be with us for a while fourman rush milanovic unloads her in a hurry to luis and luis will pick up about five <person player="steve jackson" race="UNK" position="OL">steve</person> as you watch this game what s your evaluation of milanovic says he looked a little rusty to you my god im not i dont know who s rusted who s not he tried as hard as he can obviously hadnt played much right he seems to be in the flow of the game but georgia tech defense is playing very well second call it for from maryland the terps down 13 points little shovel <person player="brian underwood" race="UNK" position="RB">underwood</person> and for the first time a little running room outside the interior of that line <person player="steve jackson" race="UNK" position="OL">steve</person> is my god fee it looks like it s georgia tech you talk about their defense looks like theyve so far theyve been fortunate enough not to give away the big play to maryland not exactly mike their very existence oh and he s got a reputation as being one of the best players a well organized they know what theyre doing and theyve got an excellent plan for the maryland running stuff it is a first down for maryland just across the 30 <person player="brian underwood" race="UNK" position="RB">underwood</person> hit in the backfield just stuff that plummets comes up from the outside linebackers body s been very active and mike that might be something when youre sitting out for four weeks you know he s missing some check offs here i think because he s not able to pick up the blitz and stevie you see those last play<person player="jimmy clements" race="UNK" position="LB">jimmy clements</person>on a quick blitz and just didnt seem like he was able to pick it up and check out of it exactly right there mike obviously that play had no chance into the bliss that georgia tech came with and im sure coach tougher but a rough going to texas up now second and 14 another blitz it gets it quickly out to johnson johnson stopped after the short game <person player="steve jackson" race="UNK" position="OL">steve</person> one of the interesting things that georgia tech is doing against the runandshoot offense theyre playing it straight up with poor defensive back a lot of guys try to get more dbs on the field where they dont kind of you know way to attack or panting off his cheek and i think what theyre doing is popping the bench plant and picked it up right back im at aint it go back and they seemed to have marilyn offbalance certainly been a good mix third and 11 for a lot of it another blip<person player="jermaine lewis" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jermaine lewis</person>with a big catch out at the 44 yard line he has been the big play goto guy and like you talk about blitzen and then it s a doubleedged sword sometime because youre in oneonone coverage which remain <person player="jermaine lewis" race="nonwhite" position="WR">lewis</person> and when you do pick up the blitz hed give us cotton a lot of it s time to try to find <person player="jermaine lewis" race="nonwhite" position="WR">lewis</person> on the out ron he s got a nice strong arm <person player="steve jackson" race="UNK" position="OL">steve</person> he s able to get that ball across the field for the out to<person player="jermaine lewis" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jermaine lewis</person>certainly that was the well executed play mike and when you pick up or flickers and have time to throw it s just oneonone just like in practice 101 it s hard to cover those get another blitz they call the right play the screen to louis but a saving tackle made by<person player="nick ferguson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">nick ferguson</person>the left corner georgia tech defense has impressed me tonight well theyre always again theyre not giving up the big plane we stay have until 8 o 9 here in the third quarter theyre making maryland work for every yard and remember maryland has zero running game tonight they have not been able to run the football second and five for the terps straight fourman rush this not milanovic goes to rogers in the flat <person player="buddy rodgers" race="UNK" position="RB">buddy</person> rogers 4030 nicely designed play if you cant run with him throwing the ball in the flat mike as this ball game keeps going on what <person player="mark motley" race="UNK" position="OL">mark</person> tucker would like to do it stephen i think youd probably agree with this when you have a team of sloth both of kings a blocker maryland s four know theyd like to get a little bit closer so to make georgia tech feel a little bit of that tightness at least to try to give them the force of the pigs i think exactly right there mike maryland s only 13 behind theyve got a lot of time to get back in the game thirdly versus 10 for the turf guess who timmy clement coming from the outside linebacker spot he s made some huge plays tonight the impairment have had big games on defense lapses doubleedged sword again now they get into scott milanovic this time <person player="jimmy clements" race="UNK" position="LB">jimmy</person> climates on the flitz number 28 you can see by his alignment inside alignment that he s going to come it but scott laudamus just couldnt seem backside didnt pick it up <person player="buddy rodgers" race="UNK" position="RB">buddy</person> rogers didnt pick up the block four sacks on the night <person player="buddy rodgers" race="UNK" position="RB">rodgers</person> had to blitzers on the same side he tried to get a piece of both guys and couldnt do it second and 19 double pastor rogers tell you what <person player="ralph hughes" race="UNK" position="DL">ralph</person> use the defensive end said im not buying any of it and was right there <person player="steve jackson" race="UNK" position="OL">steve</person> marilyn does something different as we take a look at this replay marilyn does something different when they go to that short yardage offense inside the ten they bring in a whole new pearl people to run it what do you think of that move as opposed to the running shoot all right i think maybe if you spread out all the way down there you have a just a spread out and throw it in and running here or whatever but that s is my opinion there s all kind of ways to get it done but i think you want to do whatever got you there well it certainly worked for you and louis was open but milanovic a little wide of them and it will bring up fourth and 18 another good stand by george oleary that was a good pick up by <person player="buddy rodgers" race="UNK" position="RB">buddy</person> rogers the run and i scott a lot of its really had more time on that play to try to get the ball to<person player="jermaine lewis" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jermaine lewis</person>rogers has thrown some beautiful blocks picking up blitzers maryland a little late and sending on the punt dean may have been toying with the idea of going fourth there s the block by rogers beautiful job merriman will drop deep a lot of it there learn to hang it high he does and it takes a big bounce for georgia tech well go out to the

roll i passed very effective trying to get away from the blitz go back to the ground game on this one in the movie the women dives out near the 24 yard line they gain on first down again and<person

by five secure what you want to throw intended for single and it got us a 5 people may have even gotten away with interference on that and scott played it brilliantly play busted from the start

here the terps get it at their own 5 with 417 to go we have a player down for georgia tech mike do you see anything so far that maryland can go back to the things that have been successful i think they just got to be patient like the short passes are there they want to get the home run theyve got to screen a little bit more because of the blitz but it s open for them you know the short passing game well weve got a second let s go to chris fowler chris what do you have well guys 2 plays after san diego state scored a touchdown offensively they strike again how about it like maxwell looks over the middle it is picked off on the deflection by julius bit christian 147 at that point nevada keeps the field goal lead it s cool hi thanks chris and the bad news for georgia tech is the injured players derrick steagle theyre all everything wide receiver and kick returner now able to get up and go off under his own power see if we can tell what happened on the replay as he tried to get to this ball i cant with interception by<person player="chad scott" race="UNK" position="DB">chad scott</person>it got to be patient like scott milanovic got to start kicking out of the glitches when he sees the blitz coming to take five six or past life 19 out of 24 189 yards but merrill the fill filled only 3 points for the night rose the way having problems with your protection in the running shoot sometimes your motion or receiver here this is<person player="geroy simon" race="UNK" position="WR">geroy simon</person>number 10 is motioned into the outside right here to help on the blocking

have to make sure this gets attacked and theyve been able to wrap up and dealers to hold it to a four or five yard here greenlaw a very very tough receiver on the outside and they determine systems inside of him to make the packet and as well as they come on louis 97 yards averaging 111 walk to the sink third and six a lot of it through the screen door on the side your main local pfft there s a plague at the 27yard line and that may have been where<person player="geroy simon" race="UNK" position="WR">geroy simon</person>through the block it looked like a great block what a huge play for the turks will it come back oh this is the killer still got the first down mike and they still got good field position marked up theyre not happy let s try to pick up<person player="geroy simon" race="UNK" position="WR">geroy simon</person>number 10 there s the block it s called it s block one might be number eight but maryland still with that play now that will slow down that blitz a little bit i dont see how you can call that he turned and fell the other way but it looked like a great block by time bill maryland at the georgia tech 37 and they had the right plate ball on the curtain along with the pressure coming milanovic goes way too high for <person player="geroy simon" race="UNK" position="WR">simon</person> who was open at the 30 there s yen by the georgia tech offensive front derek <person player="derrick shepherd" race="UNK" position="DL">shepherd</person> the backup defensive tackle over 92 is great in a facebook that pelant of it havent given him a lot of time

player="jimmy clements" race="UNK" position="LB">clements</person> and rogers have turned in as good a performance by three linebackers did you hope to see well that s a good call by brian be pretty defense coordinator because mantoman coverage he had <person player="keith brookings" race="UNK" position="LB">keith</person> broking on the running back <person player="buddy rodgers" race="UNK" position="RB">buddy</person> rogers and he played to play right from the start right there nearly caught the ball coming up later on tonight well be selecting our wrangler players of the game a lot of heritage right now third and can another kick third down from maryland it s starting to freak towards 300 again in some ways the pressure from german my biggest problem for scott lana this tonight is picking up the blitz he s had a tough time and i tried to read the defense of georgia tech here s the pressure again coming from his backside for<person player="jermaine miles" race="UNK" position="DL">jermaine miles</person>number 95 and that reel is a big play by jermaine myles but scott lalana this cant read the bliss another transfer came out of nassau community college one of the best community college programs in the country and marriland have to go for it on 4th and 10 i like to fart economy they got to make something happen louis to the prophet were three more precious flankers screen again next parkinson he was supportive credit the defensive coordinator he knew theyd go back to the well again they went back to the sand green testicle along peter that there was a good job by <person player="keith brookings" race="UNK" position="LB">keith</person> 135 makes the play on jermaine look now it goes back to the defense because when you dont punch the ball you give good field position in georgia tech s offense the huge defensive stand and go back to the penalty that cost them the touchdown to penalties the other one was when theyre on the oneyard i meant we doing a procedure penalty capsule lower first and goal from the one in crying turning the corner but ratcliffe <person player="ratcliff thomas" race="UNK" position="LB">thomas</person> the inside linebackers right there one guard on the play our saturday college football lineup starts with game day that an evening doubleheader starts with wisconsin against penn state mike even with a lot of offensive weapons the nittany lions are getting a boost from the line back back in 87 that was jerry <person player="tim brown" race="UNK" position="LB">brown</person> who left the strong safety position for penn state to give them a big play now it s pretty sinister second team linebacker this time pretty good running back for the nipping line so larry knew the defensive coordinator challenges defensive line jay wasnt had that carry up to the 39 yard line where it will be third and a bath city appeared behind heyyou coaches never let up you know players a crises gripping 53 what s up sicko third chord again you never yell with a player to do georgia tech wants to timeout with 103 to go third quarter to talk about this play and<person player="donnie davis" race="UNK" position="QB">donnie davis</person>will come to the sidelines let s go to jerry times dr gaza the previous possession georgia tech you saw derek spiegel go down on a held everyone held their breath latech sideline he came off the field and what happened he had a dislocated right shoulder he dislocated his right shoulder forward now orthopedist blame looked and went out on the field and actually tested over while segal was still laying on the field they brought him either side larger wonder the capable seat open hey is still fine i havent had a problem walking here until detect and it happened once or twice when i was in high school he walked around goofy shoulder running a couple burgers about the outside guys i want to go back into play and it inclinations a phony he is fast in the football game here is a little practice you know to have a dislocated shoulder now drop it back on the field and have the player say i feel fine his football mike weve seen a lot of good and sivir s this year marvin harrison syracuse bobby youve been state is john johnson wrote it while speak glenda price on a georgia a lot of solid receivers derek <person player="derrick steagall" race="UNK" position="WR">steagall</person> if he works he can become that same type of receiver for his team will they look for him on third and six there s a minute three to go third quarter marilyn comes with a great fourman rush we lock the ball single is there to recover milton makes the fair catch any seagull aware enough to get the ball back or even throw my donny <person player="donnie davis" race="UNK" position="QB">davis</person> remember last year donny dimas lost his starting quarterback position to tommy luginbill who s a junior college transfer came in and won the job donny <person player="donnie davis" race="UNK" position="QB">davis</person> didnt just sit still and say i want to be a second team quarterback he moved out to wide receiver to help the football team but tonight he needs a pretty good throws like he was criticized here two years ago as the started that he didnt throw the ball hard at all and he had a rotator cuff pride he still doesnt have a gun but he throws the hard was it he did <person player="donnie davis" race="UNK" position="QB">davis</person> coming often nowhere to go dont make something out of it he dives forward across the 45 yard line where anthem champions made the tackle well it s good to see a young man get another chance and he sat last year and played a little receiver and got a chance again to go back to the quarterback position and they got a freshman deep brand install behind you taking a little bit this year over those numbers 17 22 151 and no mistakes so far tonight by donny <person player="donnie davis" race="UNK" position="QB">davis</person> <person player="donnie davis" race="UNK" position="QB">davis</person> good attitude because i have a couple month left to play my football career no matter how these few

race="UNK" position="DL">tim watson</person>alleged charge let s go to jerry punch doctor hey guys last year ck williams edibles problem was probably the football we couldnt figure out why he was

ball came one no whistle yet maryland aj jackson with the recovery and it looked for all the world like<person player="donnie davis" race="UNK" position="QB">donnie davis</person>had gone down before he fumbled i think the officials are going to overrule which are here and call it dead let s throw down fourth down but that s a good call the official who was right there did not blow the whistle let s take a look at a dining <person player="donnie davis" race="UNK" position="QB">davis</person> quarterback right in the throw good pressure from the outside by hal wallis again mike i dont know i think came out before he hit the ground maybe that s why the guy who was right here didnt blow the whistle and <person player="mark motley" race="UNK" position="OL">mark</person> dufner could have had another turnover would have been at midfield and he pleading his case right now weaver s on to panco <person player="jermaine lewis" race="nonwhite" position="WR">lewis</person> would have been some huge place in this game and maryland hasnt caught a break tonight on anyone who s called the bitch cause im talking about the clip that s play right here just they have charlie earlier in the year to break gear as the ball goes into the end zone let s check in with chris valor grissom down is bill to will 68 yards of where point at victoria by getting a bat a program under chris hogg theyre pretty good football being now though battle san diego stay because that s a chance for them to get some recognition maryland has 14 minutes left to get out of the 13point deficit to salvage this unbeaten streak milanovic unload this son good frozen completely roy <person player="geroy simon" race="UNK" position="WR">simon</person> last year seventy seven catches number well all kind of know during the

in a hurry got it out johnson he s across team 40 to the 35 yard line keep cooking with another tackle on manziel johnson virtually every one of these receivers hold some kind of marilyn record mansell johnson with nine career touchdown catches that s number eight all time at the school the runandshoot can run up to some point soon as a tonight with president that funeral running yardage in this half maryland is tried to runnable only three times they a world 21 and they are going to be reduced the throwing and probably the rest for the game that we get the another blessed ryan s story about three steps earlier against<person player="richard roberts" race="UNK" position="WR">richard roberts</person>we tell you defensive backs to play the ball not brian <person player="ryan stewart"

receivers in the running shoot theyre usually small receivers real quick and you want your defensive backs to punish them and<person player="richard roberts" race="UNK" position="WR">richard roberts</person>gets punished on that well the i thought michael is tipped a little bit there at the line of scrimmage i didnt see it<person player="richard roberts" race="UNK" position="WR">richard roberts</person>did city hall and we wont be able to tell me a lot of it right through flames incomplete pass another linebacker play from <person player="jimmy clements" race="UNK" position="LB">jimmy</person> clemons this thing could have four mirror and mansell johnson not holding on to that football cause itd have been about six seven yard long well they scouted this offense exceptionally well remember they at 12 days to prepare for this offense usually when you see it you have a six day practice period this the scouted work against your shopping they had an extra six days against us because they didnt play last saturday second and ten plenty of time left maryland down by 13 13 11 ago comes the fillet bliss milanovic the <person player="jermaine lewis" race="nonwhite" position="WR">lewis</person> <person player="jermaine lewis" race="nonwhite" position="WR">lewis</person> gets out of bound at the georgia tech 49 yard line will be a first down gain of 12 from milanovic the<person player="jermaine lewis" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jermaine lewis</person>at atlanta maryland theyve had<person player="jermaine lewis" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jermaine lewis</person>most of the evening oneonone on the outside here because of the configuration of their offense when they go to when they are able to save<person player="jermaine lewis" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jermaine lewis</person>to the single receiver side he s made 12 catches tonight 474 yards beginning zero big play give him 500 yards would receive lee so far that kincaid games he missed the first one under one on the goal line that s about five to the 43 yard line you have to run every once in a while to keep that rush on well that s the reason why because the rush is just overpowering the offensive line of maryland is putting their ears back and rushing the passer and that s a huge offensive line to these guys they average somewhere between three hundred and five 310 pounds i feel awesome back in georgia tech with a huge advantage on the ground maryland another blitz they pick it up well pants overthrown intended for <person player="jermaine lewis" race="nonwhite" position="WR">lewis</person> coming up the coordinates plenty of golf coming your way tomorrow afternoon on espn bill porter the first round leader 7under par after the first round of the buick challenge gets second round action tomorrow from pine mountain here in georgia at one oclock oh freddie couples in the police as against flag down on the play as they were trying to get it all there was still seven seconds to go on the play clock georgia tech jumped on defense what marilyn would like to do mike is get this in the end zone and tighten the noose on georgia tech make them play a little tighter you got a 13point lead you can play a little bit loose because one score is not going to catch it but if you get it tight enough with it once four is a difference between winning and losing any players it s different when youve lost they walk off the penalty well this is interesting theyre walking off the penalty they havent spotted the ball yet and they got the sticks out that s a different way stupid offsides defense fiveyard penalty be third down third mitches well you want the first down here you want a little more nah i want to get the first down here their offense we can get it in and let me got something on second effort that georgia tech defend against a huge offensive line two heads will move tonight so you better off spread them out a little bit because when you go to the phone booth offense there bring everybody in tight he is just a mass of humanity and see everybody is in the phone booth there and <person player="orlando strozier" race="UNK" position="QB">orlando</person> strobes are trying to get the sneak<person player="ron rogers" race="UNK" position="LB">ron rogers</person>met him in the hole and it says this is quote i think black

really brian s poor with a big play and now the fans throwing the mats on the field again this could be a big penalty well check in the moment espn presentation of thursday night cfa the pores like
