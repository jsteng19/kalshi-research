down in distance against the georgia bulldogs they <person player="marcus rush" race="UNK" position="DL">rush</person> the passer as well as any team in college football gods relate to the party

george s they take the lead that s russ was the interim mascot there it s <person player="todd anderson" race="UNK" position="RB">todd</person> grantham the defensive coordinator who has an nfl background and also has a background with nick saban yes he does and i do know this about <person player="todd anderson" race="UNK" position="RB">todd</person> grantham he does not like easy completions against his defense no bubble screens and he proved early in this game pic and bringing it out the 45 yard long well there s a loaded box theyre gonna throw the bubble screen out to the wide side of the field in point that makes an impact tackle for a safety you see cummings come across in motion you can only block one bulldog the other one s got to make the tackle and georgia does an excellent job in oneonone tackling situations that s why theyre a top 5 defense mike in college football all 11 defenders can tackle and <person player="todd anderson" race="UNK"

weight forms to gain only two yards for the freshman from valdosta and it didnt take head coach mark dantonio very long to get trent and robinson his team captain back into the football game it s gonna be a quick screen throwing up top i think youre gonna see number 39<person player="trenton robinson" race="UNK" position="DB">trenton robinson</person>rally and make a nice open field tackle robinson who leads his spartan defense with four interceptions good to have him back in the lineup and <person player="malcolm mitchell" race="UNK" position="WR">malcolm</person> just popped out in

the 30yard line came in im running it all starts with great blitz pickup mike on the left side of your line youre gonna see the spartans blitz and watch the bulldogs slide right into the blitz and wad it up pick it up blush and that gives <person player="aaron murray" race="UNK" position="QB">murray</person> a chance to find his true freshman number 26<person player="malcolm mitchell" race="UNK" position="WR">malcolm mitchell</person>s who s made a lot of clutch plays for the bulldog there s the game within the game right there bulldogs look to the sideline their offensive coordinator mike

guys norman s one of them and quarterbacks have had a very good days theyve thrown a couple pigs each but their leadership and what theyre doing you have to remind yourself again again these are two of the elite defenses in college football michigan state was 15 yards allowed only the alabama and lsu defenses that youll see a week from tonight on espn the allstate pcs national championship game

position="WR">marlon brown</person>that s gonna give georgia a first out if it s on this the junior corner atoms cap interference defense number five the ball we placed at the spot of the foul and itll be a first down tough call against the spartans with 341 to go gives georgia the ball <person player="keshawn martin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">martin</person> theyre on yeah he s gonna run a hitch mike i can see that call kept holding on to his shoulder as he pulled by after the initial contact grounds are not free to get so backtoback penalties for michigan state that pull of the arm is why the calls made that s a first down with the only one timeout the clock stopped here for a moment at 3:30 which they want to use it to last time out here not sure and our dido coming over to explain to mark dantonio pick come over complain about the call or or what it s not gonna change it michigan state is challenging whether the ball was it was a catcher an incomplete pass ball is marked 42 ball clearly comes down was an incomplete pass lose the challenge get chance to guess the official come over complain about the timeout but you lose that timeout here i guess thatll stop the clock back at the point that it happened because were outside of two minutes so a completion there would have been a first down and then the play clock at 40 and it starts the clock by challenging here what you do is you burn that time out and then what happens to the back end at least the clock is stopped at 3:30 where it happened well do the only thing i could see him doing here useless and im not im not criticizing any official im turning over a new leaf this year except your ad is ruffling some feathers last week keep doing it keep changing big call in this game though michigan state with one timeout left because the pass was real complete going to the ruling of incomplete will stop the clock there so mark dantonio mott that challenge there watch the timeout situation will not have enough timeouts to get the ball back just with timeouts and working out healing to play the pass was incomplete therefore they fifty the fall for pass interference the clock should not have started were going to put 343 on the clock and the clock will start on the snap well explained there by edge so even with the time back on the clock michigan state s still in a world of hurt they hang on to that one timeout because of the success of the challenge there s still plenty of time to stop georgia here and get the ball back on their own very important at michigan state now after this two or threeminute layoff stuffs this early down a run you cannot give up a first down or theyre in real trouble<person player="richard samuel" race="UNK" position="RB">richard samuel</person>will be in

race="white" position="QB">kirk cousins</person>not only scrambles for a first down but he stops the clock theyve got plenty of time michigan state what a drive when they needed it the most<person player="brandon boykin" race="UNK" position="DB">brandon boykin</person>2 for georgia s been the star of this bowl game can he make the play in the red zone the game on the line <person player="kirk

nicholae<person player="keshawn martin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">keshawn martin</person>go to the top dj <person player="bj cunningham" race="UNK" position="WR">cunningham</person> bottom of the screen fortythree seconds left spartans for the time fuzzums for <person player="bj cunningham" race="UNK" position="WR">cunningham</person> that was a great job of the line of scrimmage by sanders cummings max in conclusion yes sanders gummy s rises to the challenge here michigan state s alltime leading receiver bump and run coverage theyre trying to get the feed at that outside pylon tommy s does a great job finding the football and pinning<person player="bj cunningham" race="UNK" position="WR">bj cunningham</person>in to the boundary esca defense he plays to get four yards in the first down or gets 12 yards and a touchdown novak set that success throwing the ball to the post the number seven heat <person player="keith nichol" race="UNK" position="WR">nichol</person> earlier in this center as in spires touchdown sparky s great consigned by michigan state this will get looked at im sure upstairs to make sure that he s in watch the end of the play me down there shy to go along on that first book that take a longer look at it he does make contact with the ground we softened my first angle even shy of the goal line so i think it s inside the one for 34 seconds left so dan blum the replay official buzzes down at our dino get on the headset to confirm her cousin grabbed that helmet get back to work still hard to go how many plays does michigan state have watch they got a empty formation theyre gonna have four receivers after <person player="keshawn martin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">martin</person> motions to the field he s gonna start to the flat and then break it back to the inside balls flow perfectly but michigan state mike they have all the patterns they have all the formations and you can do this when you have a veteran quarterback like<person player="kirk cousins" race="white" position="QB">kirk cousins</person>and you got to <person player="jordan love" race="UNK" position="DB">love</person> the way that <person player="keshawn martin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">martin</person> number 82 <person player="bj cunningham" race="UNK" position="WR">cunningham</person> number three youve seen <person player="brian linthicum" race="UNK" position="TE">linthicum</person> and <person player="kirk cousins" race="white" position="QB">cousins</person> the way they perform at crunch time in their final game as michigan state spartans john here s the definitive look down the line lead down ball right at the warm with 34 seconds left itll be a first out the clocks would stop to move the chains but then the game clock would start when theyre ready to go four plays form a yard out if what we see there is what dan blum the replay official upstairs is telling you at our d though he has cousin six is seven on the drive 65 yards a touchdown pass and a 20 yard run to get a first down as well and here s a tardy dose after review the runner s knee was down prior to crossing the goal line the ball will be placed on the oneyard line it will be a first down for michigan state and the spartans will have enough time on the clock to run it one time if they want to hand it the lady im fidel their big 240 pound back they can kill it if they dont make it be interesting to see this here we go it starts on the ready to pull kristen go from the wall to get it comes down whoa what a big penalty this would be with no timeouts 26 seconds left and a flag coming in from the line judge watching the side there the facemask during iran personal foul face mask and a defense of our 19 after distance to the ball replay first out go to the half yard lon that social goal thought they would see there we go with a quarterback sneak here if the spartans run it they do have time to kill it if they dont make it timeout taken by georgia while the foul happened behind the line of scrimmage so jerry osmond who is the comfort us a supervisor of officials and was the referee for two super bowls joins us here up in the booth and just on the administration that why he gets keep half the distance to the goal dough hit the runner was tackle behind the line of scrimmage so it s a half the distance from where he was tackle since it s a defensive foul and that moved it back to the oneyard line two super bowls see jones start to do your the referee john was always a great coach to work with on a sideline cj thank you to have your up here so it s first and goal inside the one for 26 seconds left this is the way michigan state games have been the last couple years tight and taut against the good teams to the finish can georgia make a stand from a half yard away get asteroid of <person player="bj cunningham" race="UNK" position="WR">cunningham</person> yes we covered by coming 22 seconds of man second and gold that s great designed by michigan state they bring <person player="bj cunningham" race="UNK" position="WR">cunningham</person> is short motion and try to change the coroner s coverage mechanics they had mind you over on espn coming up pick up about 20 minutes or so away in the rose bowl game presented by vizio wisconsin and oregon the pregame coverage underway with chris <person player="bennie fowler" race="UNK" position="WR">fowler</person> and company game to kick shortly second and goal spartans another chance movin up front early the quarter distance to the quarter yard <person player="jordan love" race="UNK" position="DB">love</person> offside defense number 29 was into half the distance to the goal hell remain second out<person player="jarvis jones" race="UNK" position="LB">jarvis jones</person>anticipated they look out there in that georgia lineup number 99 they dont get bigger then <person player="kwame geathers" race="UNK" position="DL">kwame</person> gathers remember<person player="john jenkins" race="UNK" position="DL">john jenkins</person>was taken off to the locker room after he made the interception earlier in the regular nose guard so gathers is over the center now second and goal spartans way beyond contact they did they went to their bread and butter power play and lady hot bell says that s why im here at michigan state is a 240 power that give it to me when the game is on the line in inches situation and ill score right off the right side they use their all big 104 minute left guard is the escort and s good hard running by <person player="leveon bell" race="UNK" position="RB">leveon</person> bell<person player="dan conroy" race="UNK" position="K">dan conroy</person>s made every extra point this year missed only one in his career to tie the game this hat was no and the kick is good<person player="brad sonntag" race="UNK" position="WR">brad sonntag</person>did a superb job getting the ball down he s a fifth year senior part of that very first recruiting class of antonio s at a saginaw michigan in just his first year as the whole to watch the job he does that is good stuff we are 19 seconds away its impart to the whole by <person player="brad sonntag" race="UNK" position="WR">sonntag</person> from the third overtime and the history of this vulgar i was some driving no time out to 85 yards down the field well that s a drive of the ages michigan state when they needed the most turn of their threetime captain gutt <person player="kirk cousins" race="white" position="QB">cousins</person> he finds three different wide receivers and then he uses his tight end has set up a touchdown here at the regulation but <person player="kirk cousins" race="white" position="QB">cousins</person> did it with his legs as well scrambling for a first down manage the clock perfectly he shot <person player="keshawn martin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">martin</person> down to one foot fine tail baptizing great football now youve got<person player="brandon boykin" race="UNK" position="DB">brandon boykin</person>back the star of this bowl game waiting against hands on it one more time and here it is at the five he scored on safety on a reception on a punt return he s brought down here 22 yard line 13 seconds and one timeout for georgia the long field goal erin <person player="aaron murray" race="UNK" position="QB">murray</person> is able to take a shot down the field again in a field goal position the long field goal for<person player="blair walsh" race="white" position="K">blair walsh</person>the 56 yarder against coastal carolina that would necessitate getting the ball to the 39 yard line so they need 38 yards and 13 seconds with one timeout this is taking me mike weve had she was over times an outback bowl history start the decade on jan 1 2010 offer northwestern a fabulous game mike kafka through its 78 times in that game remember that and then the dogs perdue when georgia rally from down 25 nothing against drew brees and the boilermakers refreshing the overtime rules will have the coin toss and the choice most everyone takes defense first the top in the bottom of the inning each team gets a possession no game clock only in the play clock and if we go to a third overtime you have to go for two sheriff s has got all of the controller so this is <person player="aaron murray" race="UNK" position="QB">murray</person> on the other side to georgia once a senior once a sophomore very similar and strong leaders you have to really be impressed with the way these two teams played particularly with the long layoff mike there s always a concern about teams that lose their championship game that go to play in a bowl game that are a little lackluster because of that feeling after a defeat but these two teams they look as excited as ive ever seen that s the team that came back to down 16 and now the georgia side some of their players are trying to get their guys rallying up to do the same but clearly the momentum on the team that came bad side of the team had came back from down 16 oh georgia hanging their heads a little late her <person player="kirk cousins" race="white" position="QB">cousins</person> an nfl quarterback john i dont think there s any question and i was at that manning passing camp this summer and he was there with about 30 of the top quarterbacks from around the country he s got as many physical skills as as any of the other guys he really does in our dino our referee right the winners going to have a choice that going on offense defense or choosing an end offense defense or an end okay but michigan s stay here from here there s visitors there s your head there s your tail what he gonna call he s gonna call tails guys to call us tails here we go there s a head georgie you want to play defense which end of the field want to play the on tight end okay very good georgia wanted to talk and elected to play defense well put the ball and play first down on the 25 at the south endzone for michigan state guides and sparta s with the ball first overtone of the outback bowl coming your way after these messages and a word from your abc station back at the outback bowl in tampa john gurdon and jen <person player="marlon brown" race="UNK" position="WR">brown</person> mike tirico over john first time for these teams this year and the third time the 26year history of the outback bowl michigan state starts on offense twentyfive <person player="kirk cousins" race="white" position="QB">cousins</person> will get the lady on bail middle and is tied up by avery jones with a big play earlier on a twopoint conversion a gain of three and michigan state having more success running the football there s that one back power with the builtin bubble screen weve seen all week i think michigan state s gonna throw it right here with trips to the right side of the formation spartans <person player="jordan love" race="UNK" position="DB">love</person> to throw it here seniors over here were cutting a damn nickel or marten pressure up the middle swinging out for battling complete his <person player="kirk cousins" race="white" position="QB">cousins</person> had to hang in there and take a shot<person player="jarvis jones" race="UNK" position="LB">jarvis jones</person>well look where he comes from mike i mean they werent getting pressure off the edge so let s bring them right up the middle ee gap blitz right up the middle number 29<person player="jarvis jones" race="UNK" position="LB">jarvis jones</person>hey if i cant beat your tackle ill come right up the middle and that s the beauty of this scheme huge third down for michigan state this is where georgia has relied on pressure throughout this game on third lon hell go from here is just under 40 yards with the wind at their back just we get protection up front of the line there s the senior president were out the energy grows it s intercepted and taken away by the car <person player="bacarri rambo" race="UNK" position="DB">rambo</person> s out of the 26 yard line so now with a flag on the back end of it now georgia will have a chance to win the game with points sanders cummings it s sanders cummings comes on a short quarter bliss just like they did earlier in this football game they create another turnover the post play after the interception it was contacted looks like a late hit which <person player="bacarri rambo" race="UNK" position="DB">rambo</person> is hopeful to score and in the game with a defensive score at overtime now the administration of this flag after the play very important determining when it happened number one here s a tornado during the return in a personal foul on number 36 on georgia by ruled out penalty it s automatically defined it will be first and tenth now for georgia at the 25 matic declined because it s after the interceptions of possession has changed hands so that foul doesnt change who would get the ball it s georgia ball no points at the top of the first ot oh sanders cummings is going to come off the short side of the field he s not going to be blocked and it s just a great job by georgia blitzing and playing zone coverage behind the blitz and when you have a veteran safety like <person player="bacarri rambo" race="UNK" position="DB">rambo</person> that s when they flourished the most <person player="bacarri rambo" race="UNK" position="DB">rambo</person> has 13 interceptions he s made a living playing in this blitz happy scheme of pod grantham he s got a tough decision should he turn throw or come back to athens next year all these bulldogs come back hell be a top five team ive been mike he s a ball monkey who safety who is said i used to be a hard hitter now im turned into a ball halter back there and he like many of the other players weve talked about today will make that decision now all georgia needs is a field goal to get the win i expect michigan state to be very aggressive knowing that trying to knock the bulldogs out of field goal position and look as in the game at running back for the bulldogs<person player="carlton thomas" race="UNK" position="RB">carlton thomas</person>all 162 pounds of them 5 7 <person player="carlton thomas" race="UNK" position="RB">thomas</person> gets the handoff left open sealed contact made by<person player="isaiah lewis" race="UNK" position="DB">isaiah lewis</person>strong safety out of indianapolis has been davis high school they have all these young backs in georgia and i think <person player="carlton thomas" race="UNK" position="RB">thomas</person> is the guy they trusted the most picking up blitzes handling audibles carrying the ball or catching it not be surprised at mark rick doesnt hand the ball off again given the fact that they are in field goal position in a field goal wins this game for tomorrow bucks mark did tell us yesterday john s my most dependable back well tim <person player="carlton thomas" race="UNK" position="RB">thomas</person> started that sec championship game this is gonna get right to the middle of the field here and from near a field goal is 43 yards theyre gonna go for it on third down and bring out <person player="blair walsh" race="white" position="K">walsh</person> interesting decision here you want to mess around anymore go to walls to his sophomore year won a game against arizona state he has a chance to take the alltime georgia points record on his final pick as a bulldog he s missed 12 this year michigan state is a time out to ice him theyll use it before the attempt by walls <person player="blair walsh" race="white" position="K">walsh</person> has had an up and down year this year mike two years prior to this you only had five misses combined but yes he s had a dozen misses this year and michigan state has the perfect man to block this kick either goulston number two or 99 <person player="jerel worthy" race="UNK" position="DL">worthy</person> both have a knack for blocking kicks so many great college programs and george is right there with them it s about family and tradition of generations over the years the snapper is ty fritz his dad mitch snapped for kevin <person player="drew butler" race="white" position="P">butler</person> one of the great kickers in tortue history you see ty and kevin s son drew s the punter is the holder so a lot of georgia history connections to<person player="kirk cousins" race="white" position="QB">kirk cousins</person>hoping that his last play as a spartan design interception there s <person player="jerel worthy" race="UNK" position="DL">worthy</person> 9998<person player="anthony rashad white" race="UNK" position="DL">anthony rashad white</person>theyre going to push right up the middle 42 yards for the win on the way he has missed five field goals between 40 and 49 so the decision is to center in the middle of the field not get further down the field pasta scoreless overtime number two after this a reminder coming up espn already underway with its coverage of the 2012 rose bowl game presented by vizio game has a kick get going to in a few minutes it s oregon and wisconsin kickoff at 5:10 eastern time so about 1617 minutes away glad to spending that time on the way there with a spark rick s kicker missed the field goal they put back bowls of

player="malcolm mitchell" race="UNK" position="WR">malcolm</person> or going on a corner routing his oneonone coverage in<person player="johnny adams" race="UNK" position="DB">johnny adams</person>does an excellent job i think at the end of the play wow good tight cover no huddle offense <person player="aaron murray" race="UNK" position="QB">murray</person> gettin this play from the sideline watch<person player="max bullough" race="UNK" position="LB">max bullough</person>the middle linebacker of michigan state pill counter with all aboard his own like this better part of three and a half hours this play killed alston false start on the offense number 71 it s a fiveyard penalty and it will remain second down and now a kicker is missed 442 if they dont gain any yards well after making 47 yarder and now were going for the most part into this north wind 10 to 15 miles an hour he got a credit <person player="jerel worthy" race="UNK" position="DL">worthy</person> rashad right they havent slowed down they played a lot of snaps to the big players today youre right john <person player="jerel worthy" race="UNK" position="DL">worthy</person> some pretty well today second at 15 learn from the 30s coasting company he got brought down marie keeps the play alive on the roll it s going to get out at the line of scrimmage third down coming up no game good defense by the spartan while theyre running a double move to freshman<person player="malcolm mitchell" race="UNK" position="WR">malcolm mitchell</person>he s going to run a hook and go and isiah <person player="isaiah lewis" race="UNK" position="DB">lewis</person> says im not buying it it s going to be on the other side of the screen on the left side of the screen but they tried to get<person player="malcolm mitchell" race="UNK" position="WR">malcolm mitchell</person>number 26 on a double move youll see it right here and isiah <person player="isaiah lewis" race="UNK" position="DB">lewis</person> wheeled nicely to cover him gotta get to the yards here at the georgia third day the back is called to <person player="carlton thomas" race="UNK"

player="tavarres king" race="nonwhite" position="WR">king</person> and we will have it 47yard into the wind field goal attempt coming up here plus a four deep zone youre going to see a four deep zone and the spartans run over load pressure with it so <person player="aaron murray" race="UNK" position="QB">murray</person> has to get rid of the football and again it s just good solid defense dark wes denard good zone recognition big field goal right here <person player="blair walsh" race="white" position="K">walsh</person> needs to redeem himself georgia for the lead pick great to see a senior not in his kicking career on that missed field goal helps a great kick right there was they lose five yards and those who are critical of the college football overtime rules we had this fodder to your argument or three plays lose five yards still get a chance to score points<person player="kirk cousins" race="white" position="QB">kirk cousins</person>on that last drive weve been looking at his hand too during these two possessions for georgia believe him cut his hand is coming back in there for this last drop so <person player="blair walsh" race="white" position="K">walsh</person> the kicker one senior almost had his career end on a missed field goal but he got a chance at redemption <person player="kirk cousins" race="white" position="QB">cousins</person> threw an interception now he gets a chance at redemption he gets a chance to win the game first bowl win in the mark dantonio era and for these seniors if they could score a touchdown fuzzy burl s tee shot <person player="keshawn martin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">martin</person> first down 13 yard line gave him 12 for that time <person player="keshawn martin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">martin</person> just runs a quick

position="DB">love</person> football look out there number 62 chris mcdonald <person player="joel foreman" race="UNK" position="OL">foreman</person> number 67 this offensive lines come a long way in the last seven or eight weeks and theyve taken this game over i think in the second half like theyve done a great job blocking these bulldogs for the most part this was an offense held under 75 yards in the first half and had only two first has at seven consecutive three announced at michigan state s offense late first half early second half and then spun around with an interception the opportunity to take the game over now you see saw the lead here a couple of times job mike and i really think the winner of this game potentially is a top 10 team so there s a lot at stake i do believe these two teams wanna finish in the top 10 said earlier both teams had a chance to really finish this season with a lot of glory just the big call right here this replay challenge probably least five yards after reviewing the play the receivers knee was down on the 18 yard line they will bring them yard line itll be second down and three on the 18 yard line weve credited a target on this crew damn blum upstairs replay officials done a nice job this afternoon here as well mm one last time michigan state won a bowl game beat fresno in the silicon valley bowl only went to one ball
