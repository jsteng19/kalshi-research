============================================================

in boulder they love their buffalo and where the buffalo roam is where the sooners invade town folsom field in boulder as we get set for the 4th ranked team in the land against the oklahoma sooners and with what went on today colorado can move up in the national rankings if they win florida having lost to auburn will drop down nebraska and penn state will move up colorado can do likewise if they can get by oklahoma tonight can i get everybody im brad nessler welcome to folsom field we get set for a huge game here tonight in the big 8 same situation though as two years ago at that point colorado was perfect at five and oh oklahoma is coming off a loss to texas and three and two but they came in here they played tough and gary danielson it took a late colorado field goal for the buffaloes to try a few more get a lot of turnovers and<person player="kordell stewart" race="nonwhite" position="QB">kordell stewart</person>didnt play on that football game when youre talking off it i dont think there s another college football team playing today that has a triple threat like colorado coming at you i mean if these three guys were out different teams <person player="michael westbrook" race="UNK" position="WR">westbrook</person> a wide receiver might be mental for the heisman salams being mentioned for the but the guy that s making it go is<person player="kordell stewart" race="nonwhite" position="QB">kordell stewart</person>in my mind they play a 1 back offense here in colorado but in reality<person player="kordell stewart" race="nonwhite" position="QB">kordell stewart</person>makes it a two back offense because of his ability to run the option he s averaging 66 yards per game running the ball the number 2 rusher on this football team and if oklahoma wants to slow down this team theyve got to stop that man well that s a terrific trail i guess for the buffaloes you talk about threes three weeks ago gary gibbs went back to the wishbone panic move on his part well not really i think was more personnel they werent getting much out of the fullback and they wanted to get a guy in the game<person player="jeff frazier" race="UNK" position="RB">jeff frazier</person>a tailback <person player="james allen" race="UNK" position="RB">allen</person> was running the ball but hitting <person player="jeff frazier" race="UNK" position="RB">frazier</person> in there as another running back and moving more to pull back watson <person player="terence brown" race="UNK" position="QB">brown</person> their offensive coordinator told me for oklahoma to stay in this football game gerald more add fullback well have to get a hundred yards theyre gonna have to keep this games closed and no turnovers police he s a bruiser with tailback speed while the dream continues i guess for colorado a perfect can they keep it going let s go down to adrian karsten if he doesnt get run over by ralphy three justin people are the buffaloes took the field here same kind of talk ive been hearing all week long ill just talk about a national title you know these guys speak very boldly and openly about this not like other programs ive been around for guys late oh geez national championship dont they say that s the loudly we cant talk about it<person player="michael westbrook" race="UNK" position="WR">michael westbrook</person>told me something interesting though he said you know with our schedule and our record now one loss could be immediate elimination something else got to keep in mind these guys have them played here at home since we were here with wisconsin three weeks ago but consider the fortune that they have had in the last three weeks in the top 20 schedule theyve got coming up in the next three weeks now some playbyplay announcers suggested earlier this week that if the buffaloes run the table they deserved the national championship brad man second that motion well i tell you what it s a pretty big table and it gets a little bit bigger tonight in the big eight the sooners are here the buffaloes are waiting on them weve got the kickoff when we come back were in cool 52 cool a possibility though that some rain could move in and at this elevation the rain could get a little white before the game s over if it cools off too fast but right now it s perfect gary gibbs wishes things were a little more perfect in his sixth season at oklahoma the heat is on having lost to texas again he is old poor and won against colorado and bill mccartney winning his coach this programs had in his 13th year and is this a team of destiny well certainly things have gone the buffalos way in the late stages of a couple of huge games already this year oklahoma won the toss theyve deferred and will kick and that means<person player="james kidd" race="UNK" position="WR">james kidd</person>will drop back deep for colorado nine game winning streak on the line for the buffaloes in front of a hometown crowd of his adrian said at home cookin must have tasted good this week they havent played on this field since the last time we were here when they took on and trampled wisconsin i think trampled was a key word on that i was down in the field it s perfect out in the field everyone was throwing the ball perfectly and it was no weathers no factor yet<person player="scott blanton" race="UNK" position="K">scott blanton</person>got a cheetah the

eight yards <person player="tyrell peters" race="UNK" position="LB">peters</person> made the tackle defensively for oklahoma and the yoyou defense looks like this up front<person player="cedric jones" race="UNK" position="DL">cedric jones</person>their lead man six sacks with <person player="fred lewis" race="UNK" position="DL">lewis</person> and campbell<person player="tyrell peters" race="UNK" position="LB">tyrell peters</person>a sophomore is their leading tackler from the linebacking core with rosen berg <person player="mario freeman" race="UNK" position="LB">freeman</person> and de kwazii and in the secondary there s been a shuffling going on back up strong safety wendell davis starts for<person player="larry bush" race="UNK" position="DB">larry bush</person>on the corner with johnson <person player="rod henderson" race="UNK" position="DB">henderson</person> and<person player="anthony fogle" race="UNK" position="DB">anthony fogle</person>they second down and along to colorado opening drive of the ballgame salons got a first down he s got about three more out to the 33 yard line goes rush on before mariel <person player="mario freeman" race="UNK" position="LB">freeman</person> and<person player="tyrell peters" race="UNK" position="LB">tyrell peters</person>can make the stop there s his numbers on the season a very impressive 179 per game brad talking in with over shawn <person player="rashaan salaam" race="UNK" position="RB">salaam</person> and just watching him play football you can really come to appreciate how balanced and the entire package that he has the way he blocks the way he runs in the way he receives that s why he s so valid within the football team first down one minute into the action the 33yard line nice play fake by <person player="kordell stewart" race="nonwhite" position="QB">stewart</person> fires it out complete grapefruit paid the price on the corner as <person player="darius holland" race="UNK" position="DL">darius</person> johnson came up and got him low and the cartwheel landed him right about of the line of scrimmage johnson the <person player="jr conrad" race="UNK" position="OL">jr</person> terrell texas the best cover men in that secondary for the shooters talking to defensive coordinator tom hayes from oklahoma he said the key to the game for oklahoma on defense is not to allow colorado to run between the tight ends last year they pushed cal oklahoma up and down the field he said if we could their successful running inside the tight ends were in trouble and remember that s a two tight end situation at all times second down seven side goes to long puts his head in to wendell davis and carries of our bounds into the colorado bench as he got it across the 40yard line itll be short of a first down by a couple what s tough about this balanced offense for colorado with two tight ends two wide receivers is it forces the defense to commit one of their secondary peoples people to either one side of the formation or the other there s no strong side of the formation so<person player="kordell stewart" race="nonwhite" position="QB">kordell stewart</person>is able to go up there run i check with me offense and either run it right or left away from the defensive strength 51% to saw third and three here from their own 40yard line<person player="michael westbrook" race="UNK" position="WR">michael westbrook</person>emotions <person player="kordell stewart" race="nonwhite" position="QB">stewart</person> looks to <person player="michael westbrook" race="UNK" position="WR">westbrook</person> you got it first down colorado at the 47 yard line<person player="michael westbrook" race="UNK" position="WR">michael westbrook</person>no doubt an allamerican candidate as a wide receiver a couple years ago a thousand plus season just a simple cruel route when you get<person player="michael westbrook" race="UNK" position="WR">michael westbrook</person>he s such a big receiver out there look at that s well covered by the oklahoma secondary but i can guarantee you that when<person player="kordell stewart" race="nonwhite" position="QB">kordell stewart</person>throws a curl like that that ball is not in the air a half a second he can really zip it you said to me <person player="michael westbrook" race="UNK" position="WR">westbrook</person> is huge when you get down there his unbelievable first down donolato at the 48 yard line drivers got it at their own toy rush science salon shawn takes it into the oh you end at the 48 <person player="david campbell" race="UNK" position="DL">campbell</person> hey the stop defensively for the shooters one unique part of this offense also is the depth of the guards for colorado and what theyre required to do because of that depth you see colorado s guards here buried deep lined up what they do is come around because of that depth and pick off linebackers this time maoli comes around picks off the inside line back there<person player="mario freeman" race="UNK" position="LB">mario freeman</person>that time and youll look at that all night the guards are really <person player="fred lewis" race="UNK" position="DL">fred</person> deeper than the quarterback in the alignment they sure are got around for four yards second down and six seven flow of the buffaloes drive <person player="kordell stewart" race="nonwhite" position="QB">stewart</person> nice play mate they go to his safety valve that s a tight end and he alexis first down lost the ball but it goes on bounce alexis really took a shot at about the 36 yard line from <person player="tyrell peters" race="UNK" position="LB">peters</person> and he s still down big hit by<person player="tyrell peters" race="UNK" position="LB">tyrell peters</person>the guy talked about who s their leading tackler just a sophomore a true sophomore also freshman allamerican last year and that s really the key for oklahoma in this game if they could force a couple turnovers colorado has done a good job of not turning the ball over in their own envis this season and oklahoma needs a couple of stops like that to slow down the offense for del <person player="kordell stewart" race="nonwhite" position="QB">stewart</person> bacon to slam on this play looks downfield doesnt have then he knows he has a dropoff to the outside that s the patience i think<person player="kordell stewart" race="nonwhite" position="QB">kordell stewart</person>is brought to his game in 1994 that he didnt have a year ago here s the hit at the end against the huge five in right there that one right in the kidneys below the eights to matt lep s us the sophomore out of frisco texas and he is still faced at 65 250 pounder and the perfect book in tight end for <person player="christian fauria" race="UNK" position="TE">christian</person> fourier on the other side so an injury with 11:55 to go first quarter so what do you think i want those qualities on our team i think we can get them let s go ask gosh come over here second son yeah you baby could you turn around note these sweats come in teal is that seam double stitched you

in boulder colorado you can find some free spirits down there ill tell you that much out here colorado has moved it down the field in their opening drive lexus the tight end up on his own power<person player="desmond dennis" race="UNK" position="RB">desmond dennis</person>who s coming to take his spot in the lineup but matt did get a first down before he was tagged in the back on that tackle and he got it to the 37 yard line first down colorado so far and <person player="rashaan salaam" race="UNK" position="RB">salaam</person> this time a short game for rashad first hit giles and<person player="baron tanner" race="UNK" position="DL">baron tanner</person>who helped clean up fran when colorado was able to run the ball inside on a football team that really scares the defense because theyve got four quick receivers on the line of scrimmage two tight ends right theyre ready to go out at least second of course the two wide outs oh well you cant commit another guy up there to stop the run youre in trouble tom mason s defensive coordinator realizes that second down and seven wall at the sooners building four yard line or else do it playaction plugin time goes to his tight end again who just got back in there matt lexus and matt got a couple yards before he s brought down let s go to mike tirico for an update mike bradd in the pac10 arizona leading 10 7 just trying to run out the clock at washington state antwon carter is stripped by mark fields who recovers washington state runs a couple of plays <person player="tony berti" race="UNK" position="OL">tony</person> true and odd to try a 44 yard field goal after a delay of game penalty wide left and desert swarm slips the palouse noose by three huge delay again penalty the first big play down why did they move the goalposts turnable at the 32 it s third and five tenth play of his opening march for the buffalo <person player="kordell stewart" race="nonwhite" position="QB">stewart</person> with 20th time again whoa chicken goes incomplete intended for <person player="michael westbrook" race="UNK" position="WR">westbrook</person> a couple guys out there yeah i dont know i think you might have been throwing that for ta coming up the sideline but <person player="michael westbrook" race="UNK" position="WR">westbrook</person> has such nice range kind of goes for the ball and you you have to do that you see it right there go to kristin say hey im sorry i thought that was for me so it s gonna bring out the field goal unit it s a big stop for this oklahoma football team early in this football game neil vasca richie and his season long is 48 would have asked for a 49 yarder and he can hit it here anderson to hold and it s no chance way left while most sees colorado take it really down the field forces the field goal attempt that it s why so thatll bring out the suitor office<person player="garrick mcgee" race="UNK" position="QB">garrick mcgee</person>their quarterback he says im not a true option man or a wishbone quarterback by any means his stats are improving as a thrower though alan <person player="jerald moore" race="UNK" position="RB">moore</person> and <person player="jeff frazier" race="UNK" position="RB">frazier</person> join him in the bone when it s in there<person player="pj mills" race="UNK" position="WR">pj mills</person>had the only touchdown last year against colorado <person player="albert hall" race="UNK" position="WR">hall</person> and <person player="stephen alexander" race="UNK" position="TE">alexander</person> joined him junior <person player="jr conrad" race="UNK" position="OL">conrad</person> two years ago a center last year left tackle now a right tackle with overton <person player="chuck langston" race="UNK" position="OL">langston</person> <person player="david campbell" race="UNK" position="DL">campbell</person> and stinks and a first play is gerald war the fullback then gary talked about is going to be an important cog in this sooner offense <person player="shannon clavelle" race="UNK" position="DL">shannon</person> clavell leads this club in tackles for a loss with hickson highland upfront<person player="ted johnson" race="UNK" position="LB">ted johnson</person>leads the club in tackles he s the man the wishbone will have to account for <person player="matt russell" race="UNK" position="LB">russell</person> jones and philips rent out the linebacking core and <person player="donnell leomiti" race="UNK" position="DB">donnell</person> leo metis become a big play man in the secondary to strong safety and an interception return for a touchdown last week is the other safety facility lexan on the corners and this time<person player="ted johnson" race="UNK" position="LB">ted johnson</person>and company are there to make the play watson <person player="terence brown" race="UNK" position="QB">brown</person> told me one of the key changes for his office in this game to run the bull back was to go wide split look at the spacing in here between the oklahoma offensive linemen they want to spread that colorado defense out and force the defenders to take a side and try to crease it with the fullback theyll stay with the i back field now with two wide receivers magine with pressure locks it up and too far out of well<person player="pj mills" race="UNK" position="WR">pj mills</person>colorado defense came up big on the opening series man pass route plenty of protection both running backs to the left side but<person player="ted johnson" race="UNK" position="LB">ted johnson</person>kind of reads the play from the inside it just shoots the gap and that forced <person player="garrick mcgee" race="UNK" position="QB">mcgee</person> to throw the ball before you really want to do but on the other hand bread there really wasnt anybody open on that play it was a good throw away send audrey now in put a little pressure on but he kicks this one high off the side of his foot it did take a decent bounce right near the sideline with a big colorado at their own 33 on offense when we come back for opening drive marched it down the field missed a field goal theyve got it back though after it s three and out by the sooners and with 859 to go first quarter first down buffalo our own 33 yard line and the option is<person player="kordell stewart" race="nonwhite" position="QB">kordell stewart</person>the pitch to salon at loose scooped up by<person player="rae carruth" race="UNK" position="WR">rae carruth</person>who slides out of bounds way back at the 25yard line the relationship between <person player="rashaan salaam" race="UNK" position="RB">salaam</person> and<person player="kordell stewart" race="nonwhite" position="QB">kordell stewart</person>that time was too close <person player="kordell stewart" race="nonwhite" position="QB">stewart</person> had to pull out a little bit and youll see that <person player="rashaan salaam" race="UNK" position="RB">salaam</person> was about three yards from he needs to be about four and a half yards when he pitched out it s surprised and you can see it off his left shoulder of salama bad pitch by <person player="kordell stewart" race="nonwhite" position="QB">stewart</person> but i dont think he was quite sure of where <person player="rashaan salaam" race="UNK" position="RB">salaam</person> was for the pitch so it forces a long yardage situation for the first time for colorado second down and 18 why i asked you to stuart a man in his face as he completes it back near the 30yard line delicious who s been his favorite receiver so far three catches for lapses what that might mean though is nobody else is getting over well i think what youll see oklahoma doing this football game is take away the weapons from<person player="kordell stewart" race="nonwhite" position="QB">kordell stewart</person>and make him throw to guys he s uncomfortable throwing the ball too he likes to go to <person player="michael westbrook" race="UNK" position="WR">westbrook</person> he likes to go to 4ei he likes to go to rashad <person player="rashaan salaam" race="UNK" position="RB">salaam</person> so just like in basketball you make them go to this left hand if colorado s doing a good job i mean oklahoma excuse me is doing a good job of forcing<person player="kordell stewart" race="nonwhite" position="QB">kordell stewart</person>to throw to people he s not in to try and it s working so far a big egg for that 65 all of that and then some here throw down a $13 otto we errand for <person player="michael westbrook" race="UNK" position="WR">westbrook</person> he s out there he couldnt hold it but a flag flies <person player="darius holland" race="UNK" position="DL">darius</person> johnson may have both right is the ball arrived well <person player="darius holland" race="UNK" position="DL">darius</person> johnson was riding his back on that play when you have third and 14 for a secondary you always are anticipating that receiver curling up for the first down this time elliott you select the coordinator said were just going to go wrong and test them hell see<person player="michael westbrook" race="UNK" position="WR">michael westbrook</person>theyre going to try to bracket him inside out but to the outside <person player="darius holland" race="UNK" position="DL">darius</person> johnson number 40pound only feet on the defense 15 yards that is a good call you see his right hand grabbed <person player="michael westbrook" race="UNK" position="WR">westbrook</person> s right hand <person player="michael westbrook" race="UNK" position="WR">westbrook</person> almost comes up with an acrobatic catch but actually it s a pretty good play by johnson because he was beat and in college football it is only a 15yard penalty instead of the point of the spot of the foul what is it what it does give though is colorado of first down at the 45 yard line <person player="michael westbrook" race="UNK" position="WR">westbrook</person> involved in huge plays this year already of course the catch against michigan the catch preceding that one and then the catch that set up the lastsecond field goal to beat texas play fake cornell <person player="kordell stewart" race="nonwhite" position="QB">stewart</person> went right by the outside linebacker and flipped it out before a his other tight in and for ea s got another colorado first down and a pickup of 11 is he s run out of mike tirico mike bradd southern couch trying to get to three in one second place alone in the packs and rob johnson s out sean walters is not turns the corner gonna go the distance 61 yards the trojans at the farm lead stanford by 14 nice tightrope job down the sideline no score here 747 ago first quarter selam fountain opening up that one he could score one down at the nine years touchdown saving tackle by<person player="anthony fogle" race="UNK" position="DB">anthony fogle</person>but 36 yards for raja sarang did you see this guy accelerate when he saw the opening on that play gianna crack and he was through it you dont see many backs take a play like that and just cash it right here good blocking on the front side the emphasis gets the down block the guard comes around and fits on the inside linebacker <person player="mario freeman" race="UNK" position="LB">freeman</person> boom there s the crack and he s into the secondary track beat to the end zone info goes very fortunate it s just a kind of hogtie him from behind that would have been a scoreboard changing seven yard line first in gold colorado <person player="rashaan salaam" race="UNK" position="RB">salaam</person> the other inside but a touchdown he got him close and then he got him in six nothing buffalo hell bhaskar rich in in for the point after not many teams with as many weapons as colorado is featuring in this year s version of their offense and speed and throw the ball all the same backfield in the same formation what a combination was 67 yards on seven carries trying to get point number seven buster richie weve got flags down on a play tom ahlers our referee deadfall illegal procedure movement on the offensive line five yards repeat im down im down so well have to try the extra board again very calm bill mccartney his team in front with our opening touchdown though mccartney was expecting a very strong extra from effort from this oklahoma football team tonight told his players to prepare for it yards deeper still has the extra point up and good seven minutes and 54 seconds remaining in the first quarter the numbertwo rusher in the country is off to a great start seven of eight colorado the llamas found a way to slice up some defenses this year and he did so on that last drive to score the touchdown as you go into buffs deli youre gonna find that a salami sandwich will get you a hundred and eighty four and three against northeast louisiana you slice it the next week that s his worst game four touchdowns against wisconsin 85 on the ground then 140 wanted to against michigan he told us yesterday s pretty proud of that one then came 317 the most texas is ever allowed and a touchdown and against missouri 166 and two just a normal week tonight 67 yards seven carries had a touchdown pretty good ingredients for the sandwich you dont need much else to go on that sandwich to make it work you know you just put the salami on your duck oscar richie the kick bills and phrase near back deep<person player="pj mills" race="UNK" position="WR">pj mills</person>from the five thunder down there <person player="lendon henry" race="UNK" position="RB">henry</person> homo will start at about the 17yard line oklahoma has not been happy all year long with their special teams in particular their kink returned units they have struggled and it s been part of the reason they havent scored any points so far this season in the first quarter the second quarter is a different story but they have not gotten off to a good start that s not a good sign playing against colorado with a slow start as you know that means you never lead the first ball <person player="derek west" race="UNK" position="OL">derek</person> <person player="garrick mcgee" race="UNK" position="QB">mcgee</person> s off playaction got some pressure and he s in trouble got what he could and it s not back to the line of scrimmage though<person player="ted johnson" race="UNK" position="LB">ted johnson</person>and<person player="greg jones" race="UNK" position="LB">greg jones</person>the linebackers are coming in from the outside and flavel from the middle one of the loss of one one of the problems when youre trying to find a running game which offensive coordinator watson <person player="terence brown" race="UNK" position="QB">brown</person> is trying to find for garry gibbs is that you try to do a lot of different things theyre running a little bit of bone a little bit of eye a little bit of pass offense from three wide receivers consequently i dont know if you do any of them that well and passing is the first to suffer and watching brownish hair maybe if too much or theyve tried to simplify to the fly the 20yard line<person player="mike phillips" race="UNK" position="LB">mike phillips</person>with a tackle but a penalty marker is the play began we have a dead ball penalty ileal procedure on the offense five yard doesnt help the cause at all either gary talked about a large line splits for the sooners an adrian is colorado done anything about that defensively here s the situation brad exactly what theyre doing here talking about the adjustments to the defensive lines the gaps escena oklahoma had the line much wider gaps in the scout team actually sold colorado this week what coach hank winces died now has closed everybody down inside and get a great price on the quarterback as you can see right there i doing a shoot inside gun and <person player="garrick mcgee" race="UNK" position="QB">mcgee</person> had to throw a jump pass early end zone incomplete if you notice all the great passing teams either in college football in the nfl youll see real tight line splits it s tough to block a pass protection from an island and really each offensive lineman is on an island this time a little bit of a screen pass but<person player="ted johnson" race="UNK" position="LB">ted johnson</person>is all over that play throwing with the <person player="james allen" race="UNK" position="RB">allen</person> that was his man and he was right in position<person player="ted johnson" race="UNK" position="LB">ted johnson</person>s been all over the field already in the first quarter it is third down 16 636 remaining mcghee fires outside completes it not even back to the original line of scrimmage is <person player="pj mills" race="UNK" position="WR">pj</person> mill and it is three and out again for the shooters now theyre gonna be putting gear there talking to colorado defensive coordinator mike kane quits he said we are on the verge of being a great defensive football team all s we need is a little more consistency and he thinks that he can be as good as any college colorado defensive team he s ever coached him tim dr emad his first appearance in a shooter uniform last week i dont know if he likes his spot right now to punt but he did get a nice high kick<person player="chris hudson" race="UNK" position="DB">chris hudson</person>waits on it and waits on it and takes it gutsy move by <person player="chris hudson" race="UNK" position="DB">hudson</person> he s a great punt returner though and he s go on the sidelines<person player="chris hudson" race="UNK" position="DB">chris hudson</person>lost with all that he s got first and goal no people who tell you when to turn overs occur most turnovers occur when the presence of a big play is happening for the offense<person player="chris hudson" race="UNK" position="DB">chris hudson</person>runs a punt return as good as you can run one but right as he s going in stripped from behind turns the ball over and this is a dream turnover for oklahoma hell see it he thinks he s going in from the backside i think it s wendell davis the owner coming from the backside gets to play and the ball stays inbounds a huge turnover for the oklahoma football team who looked to be a little bit scared tremendous recovery before i went out of the bad news for the shooters they live inside their own five theyre still inside their own five where <person player="matt russell" race="UNK" position="LB">russell</person> made the tackle on frasier and there is <person player="darius holland" race="UNK" position="DL">holland</person> doing a dance up front but <person player="darius holland" race="UNK" position="DL">darius</person> howard made the tackle that time but frasier did not really find the whole that time he had an outside of he would have stay with offensive coordinator mike banquets gary talked about a couple of plays ago put together from used impressive defensive group terrence <person player="terence brown" race="UNK" position="QB">brown</person> is in at quarterback he is the true option quarterback of the two for oklahoma but he s in a tough spot motion had appeared before the snap out of the wishbone and lee markers on the play looked like<person player="james allen" race="UNK" position="RB">james allen</person>came out of his stance dead ball false start on the offense there s not too many half distance you can go is watching <person player="terence brown" race="UNK" position="QB">brown</person> what s on his troops will be at the two yard line oklahoma s offense has not even come close to being comfortable in this football game let alone try to make successful plays their office just looked so much out of sync and just snapping the ball that s a huge problem i dont know if that foul of penile energy fez wasnt out there where they did you do successful right now they are definitely out of sync inside the 2yard line second down and four from the bone more the pullback and he only got about the poor and a half what little opening there was closed in a hurry and thatll be third down and about eleven brad i thought this was the second time in a row on oklahoma running back had room to the outside looked to see if there wasnt room to the outside and more just be a little bit more patient with it to the outside if he couldve came he had at inside the tackle and the rather running back blocking there he just kind of came up on the play before he did it barry <person player="harry stamps" race="UNK" position="OL">stamps</person> his left tackle it is third down along 10 almost 11 before 20 left first quarter round the quarterback slips and goes<person player="matt russell" race="UNK" position="LB">matt russell</person>helped him slip the inside linebacker and the punting situation becomes even more intense for tim dr egan is he s going to bad news is you got to give it back to<person player="chris hudson" race="UNK" position="DB">chris hudson</person>hudson had three great returns in the win over wisconsin when we were here three weeks ago daughtry s got to get rid of it in a hurry and does <person player="chris hudson" race="UNK" position="DB">hudson</person> runs up on this one at the 44 got around the first man and goes at the 41yard line gives us time to check in with mike tirico mike oh brad as those heisman hopefuls of the colorado offense take the field chance to check what air mcnair did today as prairie view lost its 41st straight game <person player="steve rosga" race="UNK" position="DB">steve</person> mcnair 387 yards passing 107 rushing eight touchdowns to impressive numbers five of those touchdowns through the air mcnair plays southern alcorn state southern on the deuce next saturday at 1:00 eastern back to brad in boulder 2:41 nice tackle that time by<person player="tyrell peters" race="UNK" position="LB">tyrell peters</person>who put a hat on <person player="rashaan salaam" race="UNK" position="RB">salaam</person> very short gain if anything what he did a nice job that time is dodging the offensive guard he didnt take him on strong he kind of gave him a little old lay around the side guard comes out he s gonna miss the guard right there comes in and make headsup tackle on <person player="rashaan salaam" race="UNK" position="RB">salaam</person> krishna a number 65 kind of went low <person player="tyrell peters" race="UNK" position="LB">peters</person> just a little bit too quick with that type of block go give the oud fence a little bit of credit for having to be out there the whole quarter theyre all but about nine stacks salive again broke through by the first out the shot goes inside the 30 to the 29 roderick s <person player="broderick simpson" race="UNK" position="LB">simpson</person> another tackle but salam with 11 more yards brett i think one of the great additions that bill mccartney made to his staff was when he brought elliot you slack offensive coordinator into this team worked with them at michigan before came in here he s one of those guys i dont know let me take a shot looks like this guy here right over one more their glasses oh yeah <person player="kordell stewart" race="nonwhite" position="QB">stewart</person> trying to throw back to the other side and <person player="michael westbrook" race="UNK" position="WR">westbrook</person> they might have had two guys in the same area again at 4ei in <person player="michael westbrook" race="UNK" position="WR">westbrook</person> incomplete what i think elliott used lack brought this football team was toughness bill mccartney changed his office from an option to a passing attack but i think what elliott did here you guys got you on tv now we can see the brothers play there but it came in with a little bit of more toughness from that offensive line theyre well balanced but brad this is a team that runs the ball 48 times and passes in 24 the mainstay is our game is power on the offensive line second out of 10 that line comes up the 30yard line we get tough on salon leaders again in there along with sterling lucky the outside linebacker to make the hit yeah i think you got to give a lot of credit to the oklahoma defense because they have hung in this football game <person player="tyrell peters" race="UNK" position="LB">peters</person> and <person player="mario freeman" race="UNK" position="LB">freeman</person> have been making a lot of stops just that one big priest by <person player="rashaan salaam" race="UNK" position="RB">salaam</person> it s been the only big play theyve given up there you see tom hayes defensive coordinator he s in his fourth year here this year and he said gary we dont step over the ball inside dont show a lot of shots those teams trying to hang in on a third down at against a very explosive offensive group in colorado and emotion filled receivers to the left <person player="michael westbrook" race="UNK" position="WR">westbrook</person> wanted to go that way and he s pressured he comes out of there with it <person player="kordell stewart" race="nonwhite" position="QB">stewart</person> dives down he might have gotten a first down at the 19 yard line i think there s the other dimension gear boys average in 63 yards rushing per game and he doesnt really want to be known as his family quarterback well it s tough youll see number 56 lucky come in from the inside doesnt make the play once cordell <person player="kordell stewart" race="nonwhite" position="QB">stewart</person> breaks her containment he s out to the safeties anderson and folk will make the tackle but not before <person player="kordell stewart" race="nonwhite" position="QB">stewart</person> picks up a first down nance that is sold her unnerving for offensive coordinator when you have a good coverage any breaks containment makes a push back six three to ten we talked the top percentage in the conference any runs 4:35 this guy s pretty fast too so ill put his hat down on <person player="darius holland" race="UNK" position="DL">darius</person> johnson won the battle momentarily he s readjusting the chinstrap because he s got it down very close to another first down for colorado brian stolen berg the junior center does a good job this time reaching to his side and handling the nose tackle by himself youll see he blacks<person player="fred lewis" race="UNK" position="DL">fred lewis</person>and allows <person player="rashaan salaam" race="UNK" position="RB">salaam</person> to crease it right up the gut when you can block the nose tackle with the center youre gonna have a good chance of running the ball between the tackles brain inside a sauna use colorado as you saw the numbers were under a minute weve got second down less than a yard selam first down colorado first and goal severa jones on the stop selam closed it in on a in quarter number one selam will take himself out of the game when he gets tired but it s not likely he s going to get real tired against texas he ran from 317 yards and it was 110 degrees now it s nice out here but it s not 110 degrees first and goal colorado last half i have it at the 7 selam trigger in from 7 up down i formation selam behind his walker s touchdown the second time that i and rashad <person player="rashaan salaam" race="UNK" position="RB">salaam</person> justkeep role in those seven is seven yard touchdown for the second time is even one of the few formation changes that colorado give you when they get inside the seven 8 yard line they bring in a blocking back and still two tight ends but they still give it the number 19 oscar itchy it for the point after right down the middle tonight so far to tuck down well that s what theyd like to see happen at the end of this season a great start against another top 25 club brad you called it <person player="leon merritt" race="UNK" position="RB">leon</person> merit is a guy gonna buy <person player="keith miller" race="UNK" position="RB">keith</person> just outside the screener he s going to come inside and get on this linebacker that s what makes the play go here he comes<person player="leon merritt" race="UNK" position="RB">leon merritt</person>he s 240 pound freshman fit and the inside linebacker there s the crease <person player="rashaan salaam" race="UNK" position="RB">salaam</person> has the patience to stay with the play coming from the other angle you want to play safety on this one mayo lee comes in takes one guy <person player="mario freeman" race="UNK" position="LB">freeman</person> gets blocked by merit a walk in as you said lay it off the blocks and waiting for that block the patience of <person player="rashaan salaam" race="UNK" position="RB">salaam</person> helped him score the cap dr gary had that saved patients earlier on that longrun agana waited waited and then another gear and that s really what the great backs have i think that if there s something that eric dickerson had and is he was able to glide into the into the hole and then explode through the hole and slammed it something you really cant teach slama has enough confidence in a speed that he can take a bit experimental austerity the kick trouble because their office has been able bill s pants under this at the 8th to get to the 19 and a flag flies in a pret again no patience for the play that was supposed to be a wedge block he didnt give it time went to the outside and really did not give the play a chance to pop in norman they did call it the not so special teams on kick returns it has not helped their cause or their field position throughout the year well when you do this you take the blocking angles away from your guy and you cost penalties and that s exactly what happened here now the holding calls going to take them into worse territory inside the 10 yard line so far oklahoma 9 plays 11 yards out only other receiving team grint there is some good news for oklahoma though first quarter will end at 14 seconds which is one or two play eric <person player="garrick mcgee" race="UNK" position="QB">mcgee</person> back in at quarterback with 14 left first quarter right outset back to it on the option <person player="james allen" race="UNK" position="RB">allen</person> get some positive yards james got it up in here the 15yard line picked up almost five and that will bring quarter number one to a close penalty marker on the play with three seconds left and it is another holding call against the senior brother at the distance and now theyre going to be huddling down in their own end zone again five penalties already in the first quarter against oklahoma because im one of the inside linemen that forced actually forced mckee wide berth couldnt exactly tell you who it was could prevail or <person player="harry stamps" race="UNK" position="OL">stamps</person> was holding inside leg was been kerrville to the left town guard but penetration by the collar align those big splits colorado and mike gatewood city been supporters maybe adjust with the sheet in the gaps oklahoma wont get this play off the quarter will they come to the line again though out of sync you should know the porters going to end let s go regroup and start the next quarter now theyve got a couple minutes to work on the sidelines and dont wanna colson field the colorado by 14th annual southern adrienne carson im brad nessler at folsom field were colorado leaf 5:14 to start the second quarter how bad was it for the sooners in the first quarter thatll tell you often bad years behind 14nothing the first court in the games not as close to the story of the paper ajitha throw up his own end zone incomplete got it out to <person player="pj mills" race="UNK" position="WR">mills</person> he couldnt hold it when i was a wellthrown ball in a game like this when youre trying to come out of your own ends on someone is going to have to make a play for this colorado football team <person player="garrick mcgee" race="UNK" position="QB">mcgee</person> put the ball in a catchable position <person player="pj mills" race="UNK" position="WR">mills</person> has to come up with it <person player="derek west" race="UNK" position="OL">derek</person> <person player="garrick mcgee" race="UNK" position="QB">mcgee</person> had a bad game against texas a&amp;m but the statistics that approved weekly since he had almost 200 yards throwing last week in a careerhigh fiftyseven rushing in the loss to texas watson <person player="terence brown" race="UNK" position="QB">brown</person> admitted that for so many formations he had to tie simplify things not just for <person player="garrick mcgee" race="UNK" position="QB">mcgee</person> but for the rest of the team as well not too simple on the second down of 18 near your own endzone flags fly before the snap well finally something s good happened for this football team they drew <person player="kerry hicks" race="UNK" position="DL">hicks</person> off looks like he touched the center coachmen on the deep end because of just a little bit more room to work as i bought it out side the seven yard line again read oklahoma needs to establish the fullback but id love to see jailed more just take that ball to pull back it just cash them and say a holes gonna be there dont look for it well he s way up the end of the throw again wide opens to tighten and a first down oklahoma finally they got something to go positively and it s steven <person player="stephen alexander" race="UNK" position="TE">alexander</person> their freshman yeah when everything goes bad go to your freshman yeah this guy s gonna be something special like six foot eight inch high jumper in high school he s only about 220 pounds now but they fake to the tailbacks both backers step up there s <person player="stephen alexander" race="UNK" position="TE">alexander</person> in the slot nice throw by mcgeehan this guy will be an allamerican before he leaves oklahoma and his first catch against iowa state that he fought for 450 yards last week an 18yard are there as the sooners working first down at the 24 theyre first first down his knee go down yes believe so this play worked against colorado once last year out of the four times they ran it i think it s a good look at play but youve got to keep your footing of the pitch has to be perfect it s a slow developing but it wasnt going to be a counter play a misdirection counter play coming back other way youll see it he catches the ball and <person player="james allen" race="UNK" position="RB">allen</person> goes down on the slip right there you know oklahoma plays on astroturf but nothing new here it seemed like good footing when i was down there before the game just tried to start to fast second down at 16 now after picking up a first down and go six yards in the negative category split backfield down check it down the law from again with time running out of it baby got back to the line of scrimmage my life as a ball luciano havent they do <person player="matt russell" race="UNK" position="LB">russell</person> you know grantham we were here watching wisconsin can pace it by this football team he really had the feeling that wisconsin was having success moving the ball they just were beating themselves for oklahoma in this game theyre not having any success moving it you can see it stripped from behind that time by <person player="shannon clavelle" race="UNK" position="DL">shannon</person> clavell the balls loose that was a good call and vicki turns it over on a play where he didnt have anybody to throw the ball to he was just trying to get something out of nothing <person player="matt russell" race="UNK" position="LB">russell</person> with a big play second team freshman allamerican last year with the turnover and it sets colorado at the sooner 18 yard line remember what we talked about when theyre inside the 20 theyre tough <person player="kordell stewart" race="nonwhite" position="QB">stewart</person> though is gonna go down for a loss<person player="tyrell peters" race="UNK" position="LB">tyrell peters</person>and you can see why he leads the club and tackles he s all over the field so far working hard at<person player="kordell stewart" race="nonwhite" position="QB">kordell stewart</person>gives him a pat on the hat well i dont think you can fault this oklahoma defense i mean theyve played well not there s not a lot of people that are going to slow down the colorado offense oklahoma just has to do a couple first downs at least and gain some calmness on their offensive football team <person player="mario freeman" race="UNK" position="LB">freeman</person> and beaters are playing outstanding football games <person player="michael westbrook" race="UNK" position="WR">westbrook</person> inside rashad <person player="rashaan salaam" race="UNK" position="RB">salaam</person> slices his way inside the tenyard line he s going to be close to a first down that time he broke right behind <person player="martin chase" race="UNK" position="DL">martin</person> to <person player="martin chase" race="UNK" position="DL">chase</person> number 93 the nose tackle but great vision he has from the tailback position he s off that deep in this situation here s the tailback watch him break behind the nose tech which all great tailbacks do in this play <person player="martin chase" race="UNK" position="DL">chase</person> is there he s got the tackle boom cut back blocked net play could have run anywhere from the left tight end all the way to behind the nose tackle that s the type of running that salam has great vision from a tailback position a hundred 11 yards and i think that s gonna put him over a thousand for the season and remember we are in week six there s what he s done this is first half statistics 111 almost eight yards of carry and two touchdowns he s a pretty good pace now he s up there with some big man facilities perform for 2,000 yards well that s the kind of casey s on a thousand four of the season get maybe back to the line of scrimmage this time<person player="martin chase" race="UNK" position="DL">martin chase</person>gary said if you put the season together for rashad <person player="rashaan salaam" race="UNK" position="RB">salaam</person> where would he end up how about with this group sanders alan rozier lashawn johnson last year <person player="tony berti" race="UNK" position="OL">tony</person> dorsett <person player="tony berti" race="UNK" position="OL">tony</person> dorsett at the time put it and now that 2162 would be pretty strong i hate to say it but there s four heisman trophy sitting on that page right right and possibly a fifth and you know if cordell <person player="kordell stewart" race="nonwhite" position="QB">stewart</person> isnt on this team kind of taken some of the votes you might see rashad <person player="rashaan salaam" race="UNK" position="RB">salaam</person> heading up as maybe the leading contender for the trophy i dont think he cares most about it second and goal at the 7 hello in the magic number if they give it to <person player="rashaan salaam" race="UNK" position="RB">salaam</person> from the 7 he s got it again and rochon just keeps rolling those sevens you saw gary gibbs he s got to get his football team back just a little bit of confidence right now they could go south in a hurry another isolation play right up the middle this time<person player="keith miller" race="UNK" position="RB">keith miller</person>number 37 is the flow back <person player="rashaan salaam" race="UNK" position="RB">salaam</person> seasonal boom into the hole and out of the hole as good as anyone ive ever seen run from tailback takes the hit the face but holds on to it bhaskar rich in the point after all night for the sooners so far at 11:53 to the half <person player="rashaan salaam" race="UNK" position="RB">salaam</person> with three touchdowns already when something brandnew something fresh and exhilarating comes the exact moments youre ready screamingly ready for it it s not coincidence aurora by automobile see what happens when you demand better dont let a new car name it be a financial burden get smart least by gmac it just might give you something you wouldnt mind carrying around dont know a new car payment get you all wound up get smart least by gmac it can put a new spin on affordability espn s presentation of cfa college football is brought to you by ohs mobile and your local lowe s mobile retailers and by the american express car dont leave home without it they had plenty of reason to cheered so far at folsom field 21 to nothing colorado 11:53 to go first half havent we done this already once brad i think we did it earlier this year didnt we the team was in red too oscar richie taking a yard deep the little indecision build brings it out he broke through the pack<person player="pj mills" race="UNK" position="WR">pj mills</person>knocked out by oscar rich ian or he might have been off to the races 102 yards he got out to the 34 yard line well finally something is good for this happen for this offense where they could start to run some of the place a little bit of room near the 34 for the suitor office probably have about thirty percent more offense you can run from the 30yard line than you can for this run yard line garrett could be later company have a quarterback carefully keep trots on now<person player="james allen" race="UNK" position="RB">james allen</person>will drop out <person player="jeff frazier" race="UNK" position="RB">jeff</person> fraser as the who gets the call for that s more than im running for the whole in just anticipating that whole to be out there one one whole wider he was giving up on the play that s what needs to be established for this local obon offense to work tonight or a hundred six yards against texas tech is best game this year as we look at his seasonal numbers and he had<person player="james allen" race="UNK" position="RB">james allen</person>commit virtually identical as a stat category <person player="jerald moore" race="UNK" position="RB">moore</person> is a fullback but he s got tailback track speed field positions in all colorado so is the scoreboard here comes <person player="jeff frazier" race="UNK" position="RB">frazier</person> he s the guy was maybe the most speed in that backfield that s got a first down for the sooners out at the 46 yard line<person player="jeff frazier" race="UNK" position="RB">jeff frazier</person>got hurt a year ago who follow sooner football no and open the door for<person player="james allen" race="UNK" position="RB">james allen</person>but he s back healthy this year and that s what really prompted the three back offense really it s been a twoyear situation for this kid <person player="jeff frazier" race="UNK" position="RB">jeff</person> razors shoulder surgery at 92 and then injured his left knee just a few days before the season opener was a starter last year or would have been true for that injury and so it s been a long haul back from shoulder and knee surgery great size on that spot back there 6213 first down this is the deepest penetration for the students if you want to look at it that way theyre still on their side of the field but theyve worked it to the 46 <person player="garrick mcgee" race="UNK" position="QB">mcgee</person> fires out found his receiver and it s gonna be a tough first down and finally the colorado territory at<person player="albert hall" race="UNK" position="WR">albert hall</person>made the catch and the first down for the sooners down to the 42 but he looks over to get the call but watson <person player="terence brown" race="UNK" position="QB">brown</person> told me <person player="garrick mcgee" race="UNK" position="QB">garrick</person> magee is an accurate thrower but he has to keep things fairly simple for him in the passing game right fraser got tagged pretty good by<person player="mike phillips" race="UNK" position="LB">mike phillips</person>ted johnson let s go to mike tirico brad mr <person player="rashaan salaam" race="UNK" position="RB">salaam</person> is now second in the nation in rushing because napoleon kaufman was held to 80 yards on the ground today but he did have seven here on this touchdown run as washington was able to win easily and usc did hang on to beat stanford by the way 27 20 another big day on the ground this one from sean walters raja <person player="rashaan salaam" race="UNK" position="RB">salaam</person> the big night so far as gary said on they didnt care less about the heisman when we said to hit who do you think should win it he said the bowling the coughlin no he said we were friends when we were getting recruited together weve kept in touch and he said i dont think there s anybody the country s ever needed i dont know well there s josh putting on his own show tonight i think with the quarterbacks struggling this year and gone having hot and cold games the running backs a good look at the shot who s over a thousand for the season averaging six point seven and 15 touchdowns he came into the weekend as the nation s leading scorer with 12 touchdowns and as quickly added 18 more points to that total he s the third leading receiver on the football team and i think most impressive you know you see a lot of tailbacks everybody s rotating their tailback selam plays all the time here s that powder come back the other way for<person player="james allen" race="UNK" position="RB">james allen</person>waiting on a block slipped down and helps down by <person player="shannon clavelle" race="UNK" position="DL">shannon</person> global boy is upset with himself and i think this is the story of the football games so far the oklahoma football players are trying to make a touchdown on every play theyre not patient with the play there so methodist football games so fired up trying to perform on national television you see the cutback blocking the counter blocking by the offensive line for oklahoma good job that time by milton overton but the running backs have no patience for this running game so far theyre slipping theyre falling theyre jumping off sides are not staying with the holes <person player="james allen" race="UNK" position="RB">allen</person> is minus seven erica <person player="garrick mcgee" race="UNK" position="QB">mcgee</person> in the middle intercepted liam eating drop the ball let s see who s coming at this time penalty markers down weve got a little bit of everything going on in this play liam et got the pick and then lost the handle the officials will huddle i dont know how much the side judge is calling in this plays waving his arms like it was not a fumble saying that he was down before he dropped it but there was going to be thrown to <person player="stephen alexander" race="UNK" position="TE">alexander</person> over the middle and looked like <person player="stephen alexander" race="UNK" position="TE">alexander</person> overthrew an older anna but five yard penalty from the spot of the foul first down colorado so forward lateral is what the call is after the interception youll see <person player="stephen alexander" race="UNK" position="TE">alexander</person> s somewhat overruns the whole as far as <person player="garrick mcgee" race="UNK" position="QB">mcgee</person> was concerned the immedi gets the play right here and he was trying to pitch this play that s why they called it an anemic illegal forward ladder on the play so a little mo with a couple of turnovers and again last time i was at their own 18 yard line at least this time it s back wouldnt be surprised to know go for home run here after 34 first down <person player="michael westbrook" race="UNK" position="WR">westbrook</person> got his box<person player="michael westbrook" race="UNK" position="WR">michael westbrook</person>cut back inside another block downfield and <person player="michael westbrook" race="UNK" position="WR">westbrook</person> all the way to the 26 yard line well i guess that s going for the homer under both for the triple i guess the last block he got was from <person player="bryan stoltenberg" race="UNK" position="OL">stoltenberg</person> is center 40 yards downfield i think just see the option play right here come to <person player="michael westbrook" race="UNK" position="WR">westbrook</person> the other direction but if we could stop it right about here stop the plate here here s <person player="rae carruth" race="UNK" position="WR">carruth</person> see if he doesnt grab the defender on this play right here that should have been a penalty grabbing tim denton from behind in that play successful play that i think <person player="rae carruth" race="UNK" position="WR">carruth</person> got away with one on that play <person player="michael westbrook" race="UNK" position="WR">westbrook</person> worm s it off to the 26 first and ten colorado over the middle back to <person player="rashaan salaam" race="UNK" position="RB">salaam</person> out of the backfield that s his first catch tonight it picks up about seven yards <person player="anthony fogle" race="UNK" position="DB">anthony</person> bogle tried a fifty made the stop try to get a handle on this offensive euro defensive coordinator elliott you select the offensive coordinator come from ohio state coached at michigan a lot of people said i agree he s just a running coach a line coach he said you know i used to have a lot of tendencies but i never had this kind of talent for me inside the 20 is colorado that s the bad news if youre a sooner fan because every trip inside there is resulted in a store and all three of the touchdowns the buffalo wrestlers got mantoman coverage <person player="kordell stewart" race="nonwhite" position="QB">stewart</person> keeps it nice spin move and he s got it down inside the ten a<person player="kordell stewart" race="nonwhite" position="QB">kordell stewart</person>is a four at 3:40 gap that s right for 340 is it fun you bet when youre ahead 21 nothing and anything you call works it s fun playing quarterback ask eric vikki how much fun it is the other side right now its first and goal at the 9 yard line the suitor defense is probably hoping that oklahoma erratic colorado doesnt get it to the 7 yard line yeah is then you know what will happen and comes the core back salon this time from the nine touchdown oh boy i want to show this junior from san diego s foot nine tonight and give credit to the offensive line to europe you know youre correct he reads the holes and he shoots through them i dont know if anybody could really run the ball better than he s running in this game but what a powerhouse offensive designed this team has put together an ear collar speed is about to have its 48 and they do and this young man has just tied a school record for rushing touchdowns in a single game and we still have a long way to go 719 to the half 28 to nothing colorado buffaloes by 28 to 7 19 left in the half our sega sport studentathletes have a game of oklahoma derrick mckey the quarterback and junior from tulsa with a 32 gpa and sociology and a bigot of a high school speaking tour it s deal bhaskar ichiya the junior california 35 gpa film studies at the college youd like to become fill this for extra points already that i need his kickoff that s upcoming love to study this film oklahoma wish this was a sega video game maybe start over hit the reset button right bills as to backpedal 6 yards deep <person player="pj mills" race="UNK" position="WR">pj</person> wont bring it out oklahoma will work from the 20yard line spin the rochon <person player="rashaan salaam" race="UNK"

the bad wheel and fires and it s almost intercepted by<person player="chris hudson" race="UNK" position="DB">chris hudson</person>got his hands on it coverage on the corner kind of tough to pick up third down the last four times oklahoma s head third down conversion 16 yards 10 yards 13 yards and 14 yards now it is fourth and 14 enter tim daughtry boys at county spot you gotta watch out for this

there as he was earlier wendell davis who caused the earlier fumble recovers this one hey it s 28 to nothing in oakland colorado has turned the ball twice on a over twice on punts see it makes one move coming from the side this time trading in his left hand number 17 on the receiving team ron hanson s the guy who made you see it chris hunts a great confidence in his skills holding it basically in one hand <person player="rod henderson" race="UNK" position="DB">henderson</person> comes in and pokes it out and oklahoma finally has something good happen in there for this football game for that little davis trying to scoop that way one hand did the smart thing when he couldnt find a handle and that s cover it right there suitors twonothing buffalo on the wishbone but he keeps this time and he gets down there to the 12 yard line limping around earlier and didnt live on that one nice run by eric <person player="garrick mcgee" race="UNK" position="QB">mcgee</person> to pick up a first down well of course<person player="garrick mcgee" race="UNK" position="QB">garrick mcgee</person>started his career at arizona state when junior college came back here played spring ball is not really an option quarterback says he does a lot like to be known as an option quarterback but in this type of game you got to do whatever you can to make the ball go forward coming back the other way is alan and he s down the other nine yard line picked up almost four alan wilden made the stop along with <person player="mike phillips" race="UNK" position="LB">phillips</person> oklahoma we talked about colorado s proficiency inside the 20yard line oklahoma inside the 20 this year 16 in possessions half the time they scored touchdowns three field goals and they are desperate need of a touchdown to right the ship here and try to work their way back into this football game the second down and seven they can get a first down at the two now go with the bone flags down is more got a couple from the pullback spot but again there seems to be confusion out there i think<person player="kerry hicks" race="UNK" position="DL">kerry hicks</person>that time anticipated the count and he was offside either that or someone moved again dead ball land infraction on the orphan penalty s not helping the cause tonight obviously now youre not gonna beat colorado unless you play at least play solid football on your own right now oklahoma is their own worst enemy in this football game looks like the center kind of puckers this time with this play that s why i carry hips there you see it that puffer said carry hips i can go in the procedure he keeps pays the price<person player="ted johnson" race="UNK" position="LB">ted johnson</person>up high rasca is there teller otter lines up in a front that looks like a 3/4 but really<person player="ted johnson" race="UNK" position="LB">ted johnson</person>is their middle linebacker he s the guy that s responsible for the quarterback an option football that johnson the leading tackler right there he s going to read that blacking bags come across the face and be right in the face of the quarterback nice jab for the leading tackler but this in number seven

that downfield that time maoli is going to get called for pushing on the play key to the offense i believe is having a one back off it s being able to run the option dont have to run it a lot just enough to keep the defense honest goblak whoa yeah legal pushpull domestic pushing there s a little push baloneys they only closed at old bailey on colorado for the first time chris daly s olia sophomore eliot you slack who s coached a long time in college football city s the best offensive lineman ive ever had to coach the guy named jumbo eliot pretty good offensive lineman at michigan he said this guy is the best ive ever worked with six for 280 pounds a good one natalie puts it back at the 16 yard line 14 <person player="michael westbrook" race="UNK" position="WR">westbrook</person> commotion there s a little delay drawn a salam mashhad salam got it back to the original line of scrimmage the other 20yard line pretty special lady watching salam in the stands tonight i think adrian

race="UNK" position="RB">salaam</person> meaning righteous faith and peace there hasnt been a lot of peace out there if youre an oklahoma sooner trying to bring him to home tonight was it he impressive to talk to though im sure was his answers just came out so truthful and honest about though why he wanted to say ask him about the heisman and even thought about you could tell you thought about the good habits everybody s in the hunt<person player="kordell stewart" race="nonwhite" position="QB">kordell stewart</person>plug it time to throw comes back <person player="michael westbrook" race="UNK" position="WR">westbrook</person> the antenna concealer and broken up by tim denton was in position to make the play and he got away with one there looked like his left hand was on <person player="michael westbrook" race="UNK" position="WR">westbrook</person> s back when<person player="kordell stewart" race="nonwhite" position="QB">kordell stewart</person>came to the back side youll see his left hand around the waist that s really what caused the interference call or non call or at least the reaction from the colorado bench weve have a little dosey doe go out there here s andy mitchell finally gets a chance to try to warm up his hands and his leg the suitors with ten man up and they might get to it very close that s blocking that book <person player="pj mills" race="UNK" position="WR">mills</person> makes it a risky play penalty markers down as well seems like every time we have a punt return we have a flag on the play all right oklahoma s very fortunate to get this ball back tinman rush and <person player="pj mills" race="UNK" position="WR">mills</person> does not call a fair catch with eight guys staring at him right in the face no coordination in the special teams play between <person player="pj mills" race="UNK" position="WR">mills</person> and the call of a block was it was it on you as he points it <person player="matt russell" race="UNK" position="LB">russell</person> youll see what <person player="pj mills" race="UNK" position="WR">mills</person> does is kind of misjudged the ball number 46 johnson is the guy that s too close you got to give him a yard <person player="pj mills" race="UNK" position="WR">mills</person> should have called a fair catch though he s very fortunate to get away with that one that was pretty close <person player="pj mills" race="UNK" position="WR">mills</person> this plaintiff but again came up friday for their guys trying to make big plays out of nothing again but he fumbles the snap and gets back or maybe a loss of a foot you cant question the desire that the oklahoma football players are putting in this game that to try to win it please their fans and take some of the pressure off their head coach but when you try a little bit too hard sometimes you try to do things that just not capable of doing theyre going to take one of their timeouts with 123 a remaining in the half well take a break as well and well see if the suitors can get on the board when we come back they trail by 28 a minute 23 seconds for landing in the half ball colorado of this big 8 matchup tonight pull some field in boulder <person player="derek west" race="UNK" position="OL">derek</person> <person player="garrick mcgee" race="UNK" position="QB">mcgee</person> try to get the suitors on the board which is 123 secondary fires the sidelines it s intercepted picked off by <person player="steve rosga" race="UNK" position="DB">steve</person> raja rasca colorado coming with the blitz was mantoman coverage this was a zone route the backbone down the plant coming up the sideline roscoe plays it perfectly suckered <person player="garrick mcgee" race="UNK" position="QB">mcgee</person> into the throw that time going to <person player="james allen" race="UNK" position="RB">allen</person> out of the backfield and just play a perfect centerfield into safety roscoe comes in and makes the play he had the big interception against wisconsin also in a football game and now oklahoma fellas chance for the twominute offense yuppers mold arms around the balls therefore a couple were approaching a minute the last three passes<person player="garrick mcgee" race="UNK" position="QB">garrick mcgee</person>is thrown have been intercepted by leo beating <person player="chris hudson" race="UNK" position="DB">hudson</person> and then roscoe compares that colorado is going to sit on the 28 to nothing lead and not push it i can guarantee you if this game was closer than four touch south right now they would be pushing that ball towards the end zone here and<person player="michael westbrook" race="UNK" position="WR">michael westbrook</person>youre the white sighs that watch continues door suck it down selam be holding call i think a flag flies in return slides out to the 36 yard line and that it is tenyard repeat second down sub 14th penalty in the game tonight 7 each way halftimes just 35 seconds away and that s when well get our gmac halftime report auburn and florida what a game that was who s number one well everybody moves up a notch and <person player="steve rosga" race="UNK" position="DB">steve</person> mcnair another big day on the ground in the air and with a big first half the colorado buffaloes who are going to move up at the polls now bar we wont know till monday but of course theyve got a half left but this half is belong to them against the oklahoma sooners <person player="kordell stewart" race="nonwhite" position="QB">stewart</person> bitches the salam he s knocked out of bounds with nine seconds left<person player="kordell stewart" race="nonwhite" position="QB">kordell stewart</person>kept tattoo at that time again by<person player="tyrell peters" race="UNK" position="LB">tyrell peters</person>that gets a little old brother that option hit by those inside backers like that grin that a polluted yes i did unfortunately led to a know it three stars that s what we did why your arms arent the same length cherish a kid hit by those inside linebacker to give you pointers you know what s great as the coaches say you dont kidding me hard all right you heard that 14 shots aramas he has done so many times though i carries for positive yardage and carries just a half time oh the buffalo impressive and so has number 19 a four touchdown 100 plus first half for rashon salam and at the break the fourthranked colorado buffaloes making a statement to the national pollsters leading number 22 oklahoma 28 to nothing as we sent it back to the studios in mike tirico mike bradd statement may be an understatement dominant then theyll both be wearing flak jackets john john were just kidding you had a big win there and he s lancer this was third quarter full flip replica were underway at folsom field bring it up cj got tempers pretty good at about the 24 yard line blended hendrie down there the special team stats at halftime as you might guess in the 28 to nothing game 203 the rushing yardage yep for colorado pick out any stance you want you could circle about anything you want in this football game when the total domination by the colorado defense a lot of it has been selfinflicted like this is going to happen right here on this kickoff oklahoma comes out at halftime with another penalty but it s been domination by the colorado buffaloes in the first half 8th penalty on the kick return and instead of being out at the 24 yard line back it goes inside the 15 inside the 10 as a matter of fact that s been the story tonight for <person player="derek west" race="UNK" position="OL">derek</person> and the shooters offense can you believe in street wow check back in with him across the 10 that johnson meets more will pull back nice carson do anything get on camera well i dont know who had it who had a tougher ride that first half adrienne with ralphy or oklahoma trying to hold on to that offense and what he talked about what ralph iii had for a pregame meal i wondered whose pregame meal was bigger tank because we have forgotten eat with him every weekend second and seven suitors and alan the second man kind of ran into his own blocker and there he s highland all at the same time ill bring up third down okay about five or six tell you what<person player="ted johnson" race="UNK" position="LB">ted johnson</person>does so well youre going to get a doubleteam right here watch<person player="ted johnson" race="UNK" position="LB">ted johnson</person>come up and just fill the hole fullback gerald <person player="jerald moore" race="UNK" position="RB">moore</person> s gonna come in and try to block but johnson just is in the hole bang no movement that forces the running back to find another hole that s great linebacker take the play on at the point of attack and make them go somewhere else third down and five in motion the deep pump fakes to the right wants to throw the screen back the other way backtoback tack areas <person player="darius holland" race="UNK" position="DL">holland</person> strut his stuff as well he should well was a double screen youll see carefully fake to his right throw the throw back screen to the wide receiver but it was so slow to delay that dara s <person player="darius holland" race="UNK" position="DL">holland</person> came off the block that time from<person player="harry stamps" race="UNK" position="OL">harry stamps</person>came back and made the play from behind on a wide receiver string straight out just what oklahoma didnt wanna they always had to kick block in fact it might have been we tip the flag flies well have roughing into the punter unless that ball was tipped im not sure it wasnt well that s going to be the question whether he got a piece of it or not maurice enrique s thought he had a piece the play doesnt seem to be arguing bill mccartney s saying what i was questioning was not the ball tips and maybe we can get another look to check here come 45 enrique s comes from the right side your left side on the screen and does he get a piece of the ball you really cant tell in at play it s a good call obviously you could tell how the putter was extended there it could have been dangerous for him but enrique s seems to not be arguing very hard so it appears to me that he did not touch the play and that s a good call wow so that gives the suitors our first down out of the 28 yard line you know what i really think happens you got in there so far it forced the shame happened one little bit the pitch is crazy and frasier got nice yardage across the 35 and<person player="darius holland" race="UNK" position="DL">darius holland</person>again <person player="darius holland" race="UNK" position="DL">darius</person> holidays a quite a player of military brat from las cruces new mexico he lived in panama for a time of it they say the greatest thing about it because he lived in panama he has the opportunity now to talk trash in both english and spanish he s some kind of player though i dont know if that s true least i wouldnt say it s got five tackles in the last three second in georgia looks like a first down parabola filing for gary gibbs in this second half he s just got to get his football team thinking about not so much winning this football game but just coming out and playing some solid football through this half and you know look on maybe you know in the fourth quarter you look up and you if youre within two touchdowns in east i can maybe get excited again but right now gary gibbs has to get his football team back for the rest of the football season let alone this game there s a nice job controlling the first half against texas and that s our texas turnaround the cotton bowl last week subsequently the oklahoma loss gilmore lost his footing id say whatever kind of shoes oklahoma has on they better take them off and get them switched because there have been so many slips in this football game and again i believe kind of coming a little redundant on it s just guys trying to make something out of nothing i think theyre the same kind of spikes that adrienne had on we have to check in here second down twelve straight drop by maggie look out for behind got rid of it as he was hit<person player="greg jones" race="UNK" position="LB">greg jones</person>on the backside came around the corner like a freight train and let mckee had it the past was completed so theyre going to move it up there to the 33yard line <person player="garrick mcgee" race="UNK" position="QB">mcgee</person> got a short completion got hammered is through the ball and our faces at 17 old for seven tonight dan aikido is eleven point three yards per attempt by matt just cant leave yourself in those situation go back fires at opera is tight and near the forty but <person player="chris hudson" race="UNK" position="DB">hudson</person> was there to meet him maybe a gain of five that s about it time to front again that was a morale booster but it really had no chance of trying to pick up the first down it was a get out of the huddle not get sacked play bizzy potter tonight almost had the last one blocks he s lucky he hasnt left me kidding and <person player="chris hudson" race="UNK" position="DB">hudson</person> who had a long return in the first quarter before fumbling near the end of it back for colorado and off the side of his foot a bit this <person player="chris hudson" race="UNK" position="DB">hudson</person> has waves it off that will go out at about the 36 yard line that s where colorado will start on offense and they are healthy and ready to go the twenty eight point lead how about our sideline man adrian karsten is he ugly healthy and ready to go you guys still think im in a ralphie recovery look ive never broke this way that was only going about half speed all right look look at this ive just been told i lettered and running ralphie im gonna fit in right about here guys look she actually signed it herself one question strange cologne she had hey eat my chips yeah i never stopped you before they can you know tell you guys closest ive been to a girl in about four years time yeah the last one you were close to looked a lot like ralphing thanks very much first down so mentally against colorado moves it back to the 26 yard line though mccarthy said this week that he thought his team would face a wounded group of sooners and he said they are dangerous when they come in hella came and wounded and the gashes were getting deeper and the other thing i was impressed talking to him is he says we know the position were in now we cant lose a football game no letdowns no excuses for him for the rest of the year salameh the pits shawn salon after the 31yard line give him five more talking to with rick neuheisel he was talking about calling plays what an offensive coordinator has to think about down a distance what defensive tendencies and i go if if i was calling plays with your team i think about three things weapons weapons weapons because you got him all over just use them rick had a good chuckle out of it that s up he s involved in the past he game he s brought a lot of stability to<person player="kordell stewart" race="nonwhite" position="QB">kordell stewart</person>but elliott you slack the man upstairs to the guy who s directing it second im <person player="kordell stewart" race="nonwhite" position="QB">stewart</person> just going to say for you as may be the only weapon they havent used much tonight and he gets to grab and looks like he has the first down harold <person player="mario freeman" race="UNK" position="LB">freeman</person> a linebacker made the hit this kid will be some kind of tight end at the next level you can bet well he s got a little bit of a groin injury this time i think it s a fillet i didnt hit my eyes on gant delay for the outside linebacker buy some time and then he s to check off the dropoff man if no one s open downfield corey a is just a complete tight end a great blocker has tremendous hands and i think he s probably not a hundred percent in this football game yet but a guy when he s a hundred percent as good as anyone in the country as is va and communications working on his master s quality receptions for the year 85 stuart allday <person player="kordell stewart" race="nonwhite" position="QB">kordell</person> s to the takeoff quite sure how he got fights rl <person player="tyrell peters" race="UNK" position="LB">peters</person> who looked like he had a beat on him but <person player="kordell stewart" race="nonwhite" position="QB">stewart</person> did and picked up 11 and a first down well he wanted to go deep that time to<person player="michael westbrook" race="UNK" position="WR">michael westbrook</person>but they bracketed them but the real leaders right now is saying and quarterbacks are not supposed to be able to run through that i dont know if yet if they were playing flag football that time but he s been able to even get a flag out of momentum to the 49 yard line the colorado offense nine minutes left third quarter it s 28 to nothing buffalo inside back salon this time a cutback and then the little dance into the waiting on to <person player="brent dequasie" race="UNK" position="LB">brent</person> the quasi the junior of midwest city oklahoma sooners the buffaloes rather rushing tonight and marshawn selam in particular here s where he s done it yeah you can see this is the big play right here he had a huge play where he dashed it on that one play the stretch play early in the game but you know a lot of these plays breath this played right here 13 yard this might have started this way and come into here 40 yards over here might have started this way and come that way his vision on these plays is just amazing that s why you upgraded that vision it was a pity play action <person player="kordell stewart" race="nonwhite" position="QB">stewart</person> in trouble got away from one but not the second way<person player="david campbell" race="UNK" position="DL">david campbell</person>finally puts down<person player="kordell stewart" race="nonwhite" position="QB">kordell stewart</person>way back near the 37 yard line colin <person player="collin rosenberg" race="UNK" position="LB">rosenberg</person> is the guy number 27 though that stayed at home early in the game sterling lucky didnt do that but <person player="collin rosenberg" race="UNK" position="LB">rosenberg</person> stayed with <person player="kordell stewart" race="nonwhite" position="QB">stewart</person> and that s the key when you got a quarterback that come out of there on that naked play an out<person player="david campbell" race="UNK" position="DL">david campbell</person>who subsequently made the sack of<person player="kordell stewart" race="nonwhite" position="QB">kordell stewart</person>down after running all over trying to track down the buffaloes quarterback coming into this game the last two years gambled at 12 tackles in games against colorado and comes up favoring his right leg the big seniors gonna have to head off youll see what <person player="collin rosenberg" race="UNK" position="LB">rosenberg</person> he s right here all the action is gonna go this way but you got to stay home and account for the quarterback youll see rosenburg everybody s going one way let s see if<person player="kordell stewart" race="nonwhite" position="QB">kordell stewart</person>has the ball that s what made the play and then <person player="david campbell" race="UNK" position="DL">campbell</person> comes in and kind of gets hit by his own guy i think was <person player="collin rosenberg" race="UNK" position="LB">rosenberg</person> that put his shoulder on his ankle <person player="david campbell" race="UNK"

working so far you might as well you might as well try a fourth down play 1st 2nd 3rd down hasnt done much for you so they will in the way phone the quarterback keeps it and i dont think he got enough he slipped on takeoff it appeared again trying to follow his right guard <person player="shannon clavelle" race="UNK" position="DL">shannon</person> flavel down on the bottom of the pile colorado says

on one of those and said maybe it s time after six years maybe gary gibbs has had all his chances he needs maybe we have to move in another direction now with a guy that wins a heisman and he s as respected i guess as <person player="steve rosga" race="UNK" position="DB">steve</person> owens is by the oh wait so that made the week tougher for coach gibbs im sure it s not a vote of confidence let s put it that way i dont think anything <person player="steve rosga" race="UNK" position="DB">steve</person> owen said really changes the situation for gary gibbs he took over a program of deep trouble from danger you know youre in it you took over a program it didnt have scholarships and he s right at him had a 5 min old last year he had two tough losses a games that you know against the 5 minutes to go against texas a&amp;m there are five points down and of course they ended tough walk from texas so you know theyre running a new bus on colorado put on top three teams independent but again alan slipped and coming up <person player="donnell leomiti" race="UNK" position="DB">donnell</person> leo meeting to meeting the frustration from the oklahoma football players i really have never seen anything like that we saw wisconsin get bombed out of here but it was turnovers this has been a complete disintegration from within in my opinion they just have not been able to calm down in this football game give colorado s defense credit but a lot of it has been self inflicted by the oklahoma football team jumpin offsides penalties on special teams spent very very nasty they look like a group of boxers who never broke the sweat before they got to the rim pump fakes right goes back to a stream passed the other way stalin he does what he can he got into colorado territory but only nabby is again 4 yards now short of a first down fourth and four theyre into the mode now just got to use all four downs the rest of the game it was a great call mike watson <person

nobody could find trot me out man that s 60 to 40 was good and the shut up and continues with left in the third 35nothing bubble oh easy schedule foots to brassica number one says the side a little bit of a dig on the cornhuskers who played kansas state today it survived that and the charts because well i think colorado could pass nebraska bill s it the suitors will have to work from the 20yard line auburn derails florida today nebraska survives kansas state and penn state and michigan had quite a classic that penn state won by a touchdown and now colorado number four and like an old beatles song going up the charts with a bullet we dont know how far the bullet will take them though there you see herschel <person player="herchell troutman" race="UNK" position="RB">troutman</person> having some fun up 35 another <person player="garrick mcgee" race="UNK" position="QB">mcgee</person> back in at quarterback lost one out for more nice catch by the fullback nice over the shouldered rabbi gerald born into colorado territory a pickup of 34 same play that was intercepted right before half when he found mantoman coverage that time and he thought it was zone c the running back come out to the left side of your screen nice touch over the defensive linebacker to the outside ra s goes the guy that makes the same he s one who made the interception earlier was in the middle of field zone that time it wasnt mantoman so a lot different coverage on his player tonight for the shooter but he goes back the other way high and incomplete intended for michael <person player="mike mcdaniel" race="UNK" position="WR">mcdaniel</person> he s up second down at 10:00 at the colorado 46 <person player="garrick mcgee" race="UNK" position="QB">mcgee</person> had to hit his last five passes before that well there s no doubt but he s got a good arm and he s a good passer i just dont think that oklahoma is programmed to throw the ball like this in a comefrombehind position when we talked to watson browns before the game you just said i just dont want to get behind in this football game we just cant come back to the type of game when were down to three touchdowns good susan frustration on the face of the offensive board theyre here the sudan second down and ten it probably should have been handled by<person player="jajuan penny" race="UNK" position="WR">jajuan penny</person>well there s the problem you know again you know youre sending two guys out on a password a pattern colorado has four defensive backs and youre thrown to a guy that s double covered now it s a nice throw but you still have to make a play youve got leo matty and<person player="dalton simmons" race="UNK" position="DB">dalton simmons</person>covering the guy on the curl and it leaves another third long situation were down at 10 50 seconds left in the third quarter there s a third down passing by a beautiful theyre not putting up a first down then heat in here garrett fires incomplete<person player="pj mills" race="UNK" position="WR">pj mills</person>cut inside the throw an outside <person player="dalton simmons" race="UNK" position="DB">simmons</person> again and it s worth down not getting any easier for the suitors doctory will have to come in and kick it away and right now colorado does everybody back deep and frankfurter information trying to scramble somebody back ra s disease i got it you take kostas i dont want to go back there and pump plus delta davis finally trots back id said normally within their pockets our van he was davis gets out of the way lets the fun go and doesnt hurt colorado that they didnt have a punt return man back there and they had a defensive stays they just kept their regular defense out there so back comes the colorado offense and a new quarterback as they think this one is in a hand enough that<person player="kordell stewart" race="nonwhite" position="QB">kordell stewart</person>s night is done in comes coy <person player="koy detmer" race="UNK" position="QB">detmer</person> boy denver saw a lot of action two years ago against this oklahoma sooner group there s his numbers on the season we saw him throw that touchdown pass get ready to watch a guy who loves playing football right he smiles he after he gets hit shopman an original problem at 84 yards in a hurry<person player="rod henderson" race="UNK" position="DB">rod henderson</person>hit him low to knock him off his pins denver was pushed into duty two years ago against the suitors because of an injury to<person player="kordell stewart" race="nonwhite" position="QB">kordell stewart</person>and while he put up big numbers yardage wise and had a couple of touchdowns he also had five interceptions just a freshman then it was just a freshman but he s a type of guy that s got no quit in him when he s behind he s just gonna keep fired in there interceptions really doesnt bother him he s got that attitude of a passer and it really just throwing the ball downfield no matter what the circumstances he s gonna have to hold his first pass for the fourth quarter because we played three at folsom field and control 35 another brad nessler gary danielson and adrian karsten team boulder colorado with a buffalo s lead 35 to nothing as we start the fourth quarter a second down to mccoy dampener on playaction wants a big one lays it out for <person player="michael westbrook" race="UNK" position="WR">westbrook</person> scallion and <person player="michael westbrook" race="UNK" position="WR">westbrook</person> hazard down on the 12 yard line gary said he loves to play 60yard pass hookup the focus of colorado s football team will change next year itll be more pass oriented around this guy right here oh is his talent that his pastor is probably any backup that ever played college football scene a great fake in he had just a tremendous touch now this one wasnt a real difficult throw because he beats him denton by about six yards but quite denver just has that feel for throwing the ball that you can teach for the 13 yard line and half trotman got a couple and then got pasted by perry <person player="terry collier" race="UNK" position="RB">collier</person> let s go down to adrian carson war on corps <person player="koy detmer" race="UNK" position="QB">detmer</person> brat that play is the same when i saw him practice on thursday only coid through it like 70 yards in the air and gary you knows their difference now hell pass it long as opposed to just throwing long <person player="christian fauria" race="UNK" position="TE">christian</person> for you the tight end told me he would love to have just another year to play with boys just because he s such a tough kid well i dont think <person player="christian fauria" race="UNK" position="TE">christian</person> knew he was gonna be on national television you know i could throw out 70 yards to it just took your two throws second down and a chaplain cuts back and he s down with a five a couple yards short for the first down also bill mccartney talking with us about coy <person player="koy detmer" race="UNK" position="QB">detmer</person> and he did throw a touchdown pass in the game against wisconsin and he said you know i cant send the kid in there and tell him not to do the things he loves to do you cant hold back later i picked colorado to win the national championship this year in a preseason polls because i felt they were the only major team that had two quarterbacks and you know nebraska now losing tommy <person player="jeff frazier" race="UNK" position="RB">frazier</person> i think colorado is a better football team than the basketball right now without tommy <person player="jeff frazier" race="UNK" position="RB">frazier</person> florida both way today and they lost that s the other group you would look at yeah that s pretty good right chopin dont think so might have gotten inside the five but <person player="darius holland" race="UNK" position="DL">darius</person> johnson put a hit on him and a flag down in the mix and it is holding against colorado this might blew it back just far enough where they can throw 35 to nothing now it s the largest lead ever against oklahoma by a colorado football well and remember what bill mccartney inherited when he came to colorado this is a team in at 82 points scored against them by an oklahoma team so what a job he s done to turn around a program and now if theyre he s one of the elite programs in the country and as long as he s here they will be on the other side the record as you saw earlier against the teams that sooner fan nebraska s the texas and the colorado s not what he wants it to be obviously 13:11 left with a football game goes back fires to the end zone just off the fingertips of pill <person player="phil savoy" race="UNK" position="WR">savoy</person> we could hold it beautiful read nice throw you like your quarterbacks did not throw behind a nose type of plays and by <person player="koy detmer" race="UNK" position="QB">detmer</person> put it in a spot where just his guy could get the plays he goes from his left side to the right perfect touch just like his brother ty did puts it in a position where it s either a touchdown or nothing nice throw and a nice play out by <person player="phil savoy" race="UNK" position="WR">savoy</person> foster aegean 32 yards they got it with 12 minutes 53 seconds remaining in the football game fourth ranked colorado set to move up in the polls and theyve moved it up to 38 and of it the sooners of oklahoma 38 to nothing with 12 minutes and 52 seconds left in the football game bhaskar richey and set the kick fraser for the suitors the six yard line that s outside got to the party and that is it as we said colorado without a doubt will be moving up and how far do they move up when they go to six and okay well here s what if i was voting this is what i would do i would leapfrog penn state to number one birthday lost and i would move colorado to number two and i would make basket number three i think colorado s played a better schedule and i think penn state buy them a little better win against michigan than colorado did it michigan deserves the number one spot well this is the fourth top 25 team that colorado has faced in the last five weeks and theyve got to lie ahead the state of nebraska knocked around to do that as fraser goes down should never stop talk about ranked teams you look at some of the clubs around the country that have wits against ranked teams colorado already with three that s soon to become a four yeah let s do that right now okay before nebraska got one today over kansas state colorado state eight sally lubitz clubs unbeaten over in fort collins not too far for we are penn state and ah we got their first one with a win over florida talk about finding a big one that fit to eat well and then and that s feed the colorado art and then we played the toughest schedule and we took them on and we feed everybody we deserve trying to break a tackle he does get a first down though nice jab by <person player="pj mills" race="UNK" position="WR">mills</person> that time waiting for the ball and making a fake just as he receives the ball to try to make a big play out of the pass vijay had a couple of catches for 56 yards and the only oklahoma touchdown last year at the twenty seven to ten loss to colorado tj goes by <person player="pj mills" race="UNK" position="WR">pj</person> because his first name was percy and his neck his head and so he prefers it percy james <person player="pj mills" race="UNK" position="WR">pj</person> sounds a little better at it and he runs up for three to get involved a lot that i mostly the pink litter trip top flip boy when bohr started it nose tackle in that game we did against wisconsin when flavel was out with a suspension and he just broke right through for this one here s clint more right here he should be blocked this guy out here is the option man when the inside man is being defeated on a blocking scheme for an option that s going to tear your option apart the defensive end has to be accounted for by either the fullback or the guard second down out of 14 with the loss little fleaflicker gets it throws to a wide open receiver but he threw it over the colorado bench hold the shoulder say a bread to join <person player="jajuan penny" race="UNK" position="WR">penny</person> 9 was standing out on the 40yard line no one within 15 yards of him he s the number one guy again oklahoma not giving the plate a chance in this foot bucket too anxious the play was set up perfectly in the middle of the field wide open cookie getting up all day so he shows what he s made of but the third hearing loads it s got a band wide open and he made the catch at the 39 yard line<person player="jajuan penny" race="UNK" position="WR">jajuan penny</person>well i got open again here yeah both would have been touchdowns this time of busted coverage between eric mitchell and the free safety that time and let the receiver just went right down the field but <person player="jajuan penny" race="UNK" position="WR">penny</person> does make a beautiful catch on a fall it was slightly overthrown brian black the safety holds on the tight end <person player="stephen alexander" race="UNK" position="TE">alexander</person> and boom right down the middle of the field the backups for colorado secondary are starting to make some busts back there and it s causing some problems youre on <person player="jajuan penny" race="UNK" position="WR">penny</person> first catch ever against colorado and a career long 33 otter laid out make a nice grab first down at the 39 yard line 10:35 left in the game fraser 4:36 john <person player="jon knutson" race="UNK" position="LB">knutson</person> made another tackle that s it derrick mckey will absolutely kill himself after he sees that fleaflicker play out open benny was on that first platter aplay back he just dont get him open a more open than that easy for us to say from level 5 camera that since that s his number one guy on that play and that s who s designed to go through you gotta say you got it forward to the back second down and seven for other ten minutes in the ball game my actions for the day deep down the middle oh what a hit michael <person player="mike mcdaniel" race="UNK" position="WR">mcdaniel</person> madame mistimed his jump just a little bit and then he was made of <person player="mike mcdaniel" race="UNK" position="WR">mcdaniel</person> sandwiches 17 yard line im <person player="mike mcdaniel" race="UNK" position="WR">mcdaniel</person> jenny wilkins number 20 was sitting in center field that time if heda looked for the ball he could have got a pick but all he had eyes for was for <person player="mike mcdaniel" race="UNK" position="WR">mcdaniel</person> on this play youre a big big burger right here he was coming to get it it s ready all right calm boom we have <person player="matt russell" race="UNK" position="LB">russell</person> from one side and kenny welcome to the other with or without fries either way third down and seven but he lays it out long for <person player="pj mills" race="UNK" position="WR">mills</person> almost intercepted by eric mitchell now weve got a lineman down these junior <person player="jr conrad" race="UNK" position="OL">conrad</person> the right tackle for ho you like <person player="jr conrad" race="UNK" position="OL">jr</person> 311 pounder absolutely nothing worse in a game that being shut out 38 to nothing and having one of your starters in that position well take a timeout with an injury with nine minutes and 37 seconds remaining in the ball game in its colorado 38 to oklahoma nothing as we develop the new porsche 911 carrera our german test center was buzzing with new thinking a radical new suspension a more powerful engine the suggestions came from far and wide the new 911 is still available in red black and white but what fun would that be good news for oklahoma 937 all what s left i guess shooters driving in there and scrap but the trailing 387 fourth down at seven the g steps ahead a tip to the line and complete<person player="mike phillips" race="UNK" position="LB">mike phillips</person>i believe is the guy who got his hand on it everybody in the act offense and defense and special teams just a couple of miscues as far as turnovers by colorado or this thing would be looking worse check in with mr karsten but a lot of the physical dominance we have seen on colorado sparked a lot of that credit has to go to ej priests he is actually doctor really has his phd really the only strength and conditioning coach in the country has such a screen up his approach to the buffaloes is running 12 races if you can believe that not 12 games 12 races what he wants to do is have them peak physically actually in a certain hour on game day or in this case game night the idea of just maintaining strength in the weight room is gone he wants new personal bests every week he s also pull mccartney s body guard he comes fast me about five minutes ago says back up back up that s the second big buffalo you got next to tonight second down at fours denver on a broken play picked up six close to a first down is going to be london <person player="lendon henry" race="UNK" position="RB">henry</person> when then <person player="lendon henry" race="UNK" position="RB">henry</person> is another true freshman that colorado people are very excited about and he s really coming out yet not gone through what they call the ncaa clearing house the last time we were here so you didnt play against wisconsin because his transcripts from high school if not all been cleared through for him to take part in that game from port arthur texas got the first down to the 48 roderick <person player="broderick simpson" race="UNK" position="LB">simpson</person> is the one that any rolled out of eight minutes and 17 seconds to the ballgame gary were talking about during one of the breaks colorado s done this meaning six wins for the most part on the road yeah that s what s the amazing thing all these stats that colorado s put up they played the face of their schedule so far on the road this is just their third home game right here they put on more stats they said it was nice last night to have their the tax would go to a theater instead of a conference room at a hotel on the road penalty markers in the backfield as deborah throws incomplete yeah kristi andersen slipped and fell on the comeback that time in a timing route she see the signal for holding idle back it up make it to first down and 20 but the scheduler we talked about it does it end the night as far as ranked teams for bill mccartney of the buffaloes because next up theyve got another big 8 matchup with kansas state and then of course in two weeks nebraska ah get back to the 32 yard line here s their remaining schedule of course it will be six and oh when this one s over then kansas state at second ranked nebraska oklahoma state at kansas is no easy one either than iowa state to cap it off went through that schedule you should be somebody s number first in 26 <person player="lendon henry" race="UNK" position="RB">henry</person> wraps up as soon as he got to the line of scrimmage the bluest of those man but sooner defense i think is you know played about what i thought theyd play like theyve just got no help from their offense and you just keep giving back that ball to colorado you know you give up 38 points but when you consider that your offense hasnt done a thing in this football game you know but normal offense you know keeps the game much much closer for 38 points oklahoma s total yards in this game crowd over the middle had a tip inside might have been<person player="fred lewis" race="UNK" position="DL">fred lewis</person>again for those manner gotten away of that aerial story of this one though is colorado when they got it they did something with it like four consecutive touchdowns on four straight possessions in the was rashad <person player="rashaan salaam" race="UNK" position="RB">salaam</person> seven yards seven yards seven yards in a nine yard or just to break the monotony yeah there it is right there though oklahoma right there unforced errors i believe in this put ball game has really been tougher alcohol and motion ive done the right side of the colorado line alva thomas baby cow his stance a little bit too quick deadfall youll procedure all start on the offense down how does will make it third and thirty while youre at it now weve been here two games of fifty five points against wisconsin thirty eight points here against oklahoma i expect bill will be sending us airplane tickets higher every remaining home game im not coming back third thirty lays it out for kid and it s intercepted wesley picks that one off for the suitors nayland wesley the junior on a houston for deal with her like i mean coin would have liked to have thrown that another 10 or 15 yards his kid had to stop for the ball but just as good as a punt in this situation it s 6:40 for all of remains the sights 6:44 left of this one buggy laying that long and it s intercepted right back by colorado and it s kenny walking and bringing it the other way for the buffaloes garak will be better days or nights this is not honorable jenny wilkins just playing basically centerfield throw them to <person player="jajuan penny" race="UNK" position="WR">penny</person> again number 89 there you see mother is on the left side of your screen just standing there what even in the middle of the field just like a terribly poor read by mckee that time trying to force something into nothing that s really been the story of this football game oklahoma trying to make a play on every play when they really dont have it available to it oh offense havent given it up a moment ago gets it right back with coy <person player="koy detmer" race="UNK" position="QB">detmer</person> if the controls of the

tuck run just had his foot hit the chalk line on the sidelines as he was making his well see youre sitting quite gently when he s going to have to do if you run this offense one back at too tight in
