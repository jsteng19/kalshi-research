============================================================

today s spotlight shines on two quarterbacks one is a newcomer helping lay a new foundation to a onceproud program the other another firstyear player who replace one of the best alltime players in the big east and led his team to one of the biggest wins in school history today it s syracuse and usf in the big east etwork game of the week right now welcome to the big east network game of the week presented by pnc this afternoon were in syracuse new york the home of the horns it s the biggest opener for syracuse and the undefeated bowls of uss george shelby number 95 a twotime allamerican defensive end for usm this afternoon hell have his ears pinned back and his eyes focus on the quarterback at syracuse number two<person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">greg paulus</person>a graduate student but playing quarterback for the first time in his collegiate career hi everybody along with former pitt quarterback john can jamie im mike gleason great to have you with us quinn chess nick the third member of our broadcast team well be checking in momentarily well get back to the usf syracuse game in just a second but first let s get you up to speed with the rest of the big east conference here we are noon on saturday and it s been already a busy week games on thursday and friday well the big east is really playing earlier in the week and getting things done and i think it s starting to separate in the big east a little bit with cincinnati still undefeated but pitt and west virginia both playing well and it all started with west virginia on thursday night knocking off colorado bouncing back with that log to auburn where they had six turnovers but they had four more on the first half against colorado on thursday night hit with a big second half against louisville last night is bill stahl fires three touchdown passes that gives him 11 for the year tying tony pike of cincinnati but tony pike heads for oxford ohio to take on the red hawks to miami who knows how many touchdown passes he could throw this afternoon let s get back to that west virginia game on the thursday night john yeah west virginia home coking is what the mountaineers really needed because knoll devine was running up and down the field 220 yards rushing he had a <person player="rob long" race="UNK" position="P">long</person> of 77 for a touchdown he had a 10 yard average so the mountaineers overcame again four turnovers but at home had enough to win and pittsburgh did a great job of bouncing back after that loss at nc state i think the story of the game was bill stahl he really controlled the tempo of the game 342 yards passing and three touchdowns on the road at louisville but cincinnati theyve been the flagship of the big east conference so far early in the year and the combination of tony pike tamar t gilyard has been unstoppable gilyard last week against fresno state had nine for a careerhigh 177 yards and two touchdowns and tony pike he may be mentioned in hydron talk so it s been exciting for cincinnati one year ago tony pike got his first collegiate start against miami all he did was hit 20 of 24 passes right now let s check in with our big east insider quintus nick who spent part of yesterday talking with bill stewart the head jokes of west virginia yeah i got coach seward on the phone yesterday afternoon he posed a question to me that how often does the team give the <person player="torrey ball" race="UNK" position="DL">ball</person> away for time yet still win he was basking in his team s perseverance and really pointing to this week of practice he said were bringing out the super glue were bringing out everything possible to focus on <person player="torrey ball" race="UNK" position="DL">ball</person> security the star in his mind was noel devine especially the drive late in the third quarter in the start of the fourth quarter he felt that that cemented the wind and good news for mountaineer fans scooter barry their star defensive lineman will be back in uniform next saturday here in the carrier dome for pitt they want that i spoke to him this morning going in a halftime fit was down 10 7 i asked him what changed he said nothing changed that we stayed calm we stayed composed we stopped shooting ourselves in the foot talked about his quarterback he felt that pat stoll was most effective excuse me bill cole was most effective throwing beats because he got all sorts of time to throw and keep in mind fit has only given up three facts all season and meanwhile they have generated 23 sacks in five games all right thanks a lot quinta getting back to our big game now the bowls of us depth and the orange of syracuse baba bowl clicking to start five and oh syracuse if they could win this game today john theyll be over the 500 mark for the first time since september 30th of 2006 usf goes down to tallahassee last week and knocks off florida state it s amazing not only that they won the game but <person player="bj daniels" race="UNK" position="QB">bj</person> daniel he wins in his hometown and the numbers he posted were phenomenal well the redshirt freshman really didnt look like his first start because he had everything under control in that big win probably the biggest win in school history at 17 to 7 he had 341 yards of total offense to touchdown he rushed for 126 yards and like this guy is very big very athletic he s a slashing type of runner and he must let the game come to him in his second start dont really push the issue here on the road in the carrier dome let the come to him how about that guy playing quarterback at syracuse used to play point guard yeah yeah yeah the old guy everybody said he couldnt do it he s hitting 68 percent of his passes<person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">greg paulus</person>would a terrific story after playing point guard for duke and being really everybody s allamerican pumped at syracuse and does a terrific job of just leading this office he s played extremely well he s made great decisions at the quarterback spot and he moves around the pocket to keep plays alive and i think his poise and his determination at the quarterback spot will keep syracuse in this game now the key for <person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">greg</person> today really dont get trapped in that pocket try to move the pocket use your snap down to keep those big defensive ends off of them well hell try to get the <person player="torrey ball" race="UNK" position="DL">ball</person> to number one<person player="mike williams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike williams</person>a couple of weeks ago in the win against northwestern 11 catches 209 yards currently he is number two in the big east with 109 yards receiving a game syracuse usm the kickoff is coming up on the other side welcome back inside the carrier dome in syracuse the orange and the bulls are ready to roll and before we kick this thing s off but let s go downstairs and check in with twenty standing by with <person player="doug hogue" race="UNK" position="LB">doug</person> marrone coach what was the most important thing you told your teams before coming out oh youve got to relax and play hard today and display our game and and again that fell push too hard and just played 13 football if there s one trait that s going to get this game won for you what was that big well i think we have to you know put up points off mentally and we have to contain their defense and then why do you have to play well and this board about the tremendous talent and we have to stop him thanks great thank you all right thank you quench where do john us self won the toss they deferred theyll kick some syracuse without the <person player="torrey ball" race="UNK" position="DL">ball</person> first i think they want to get that defense out and try to create field position with their defense and really the uphill battle for the orange on special teams and on offense is to control the football game and keep that<person player="bj daniels" race="UNK" position="QB">bj daniels</person>explosive offense on the sideline number 32<person player="eric schwartz" race="UNK" position="K">eric schwartz</person>ready to kick things off for the bulls the defend he saw moments to go<person player="mike jones" race="UNK" position="RB">mike jones</person>back there s great <person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">paulus</person> he s jacked up and ready to go getting that right wing loosened up and here we go this football game is underway the big east opener jones set the 15 at the short kick disgustin running room penalty flags dropped to the 35 yard line john cuts it back he s still on his feet over the 45 and dropped at the 47 a return of 33 yards but again penalty flags back at the 35 yard line oh 33 replaced me tenyard penalty from the spot of the foul percent while the holding penalty goes against the dan vaughn backup linebacker for syracuse a<person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">greg paulus</person>now cognizant of those two big defense events taking the field for the first time in the big east oh a different time a different type of game for <person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">greg</person> pollock he s going to face a mean pass rush and an aggressive defense though still have to stay within himself he s doing doing a great job of making decisions and i like all the intangibles that <person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">paulus</person> brings to the table at quarterback so hell have to use his weapons on the outside but a good mixer running past today six touchdowns only four interceptions and completing close to 70 percent of his passes this season 68 percent that s amazing first play from scrimmage twin receivers top of your screen out of the i formation and they give it to the <person player="rob long" race="UNK" position="P">long</person> carter he pops about the couple would be popular except over the 20 drops about the 23 24 yard line let s take a look at our impact players brought to you by the united states marine corps and delon carter is one of those impact players along with<person player="mike williams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike williams</person>he has a string of 24 straight games with the reception we just saw carter on the last carry he had four touchdowns his first career receiving touchdown last week and then does <person player="doug hogue" race="UNK" position="LB">hogue</person> on the defensive side a converted running back hell make plays on the defensive side in the iformation williams in motion playaction rippen s polyps looking down the middle finds his hands up over the 4045 trip after a gain of 20 is <person player="mistral raymond" race="UNK" position="DB">raymond</person> going to get flagged for a late hit i think though i think<person player="mike williams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike williams</person>are going down the sideline first up ya personal foul mic against the bulls and that s going to give the orange instant fuel position nice play call on the outside by rob spence the offensive coordinating get and <person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">paulus</person> on the edge and then the explosiveness of<person player="mike williams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike williams</person>running through and definitely a personal foul williams already out of bounds probably a good yard yard and a half when he was hit into the bench so mistake football early by the bulls mike going the tight end mrs carter trying to sweep left cuts it back and he picks them here two or three put the <person player="torrey ball" race="UNK" position="DL">ball</person> on the carpet usf says theyve got the football and they do first turnover the <person player="torrey ball" race="UNK" position="DL">ball</person> game and in south florida coming up with the fumble recovery quite in <person player="quenton washington" race="UNK" position="DB">washington</person> the sophomore cornerback out of fort myers florida and carter doesnt fumble often but this is a big one for syracuse they would like a change mike it looked like a hand on the football right there might have been 97 tyrell <person player="terrell mcclain" race="UNK" position="DL">mcclain</person> who came by with the left hand to strip the football away from the loan carter but that was exactly the way they wanted this to start but theyre going to take a look at this we see its partners mean who was down on the play <person player="doug hogue" race="UNK" position="LB">doug</person> marrone the head coach at syracuse john saying it s imperative that we come out fast and as we take a look at it so they did come out fast they were moving the change week they came out with lightning pay standalone carter at plenty of running room off the left side let s see if that knee touches down there s the first contact on the outside by <person player="quenton washington" race="UNK" position="DB">washington</person> cant tell if the <person player="torrey ball" race="UNK" position="DL">ball</person> down low the <person player="torrey ball" race="UNK" position="DL">ball</person> was out i think that s a good call by the officials the needs of the loan carter were still off the ground when this <person player="torrey ball" race="UNK" position="DL">ball</person> comes out a good stripped by<person player="terrell mcclain" race="UNK" position="DL">terrell mcclain</person>right there with the left hand and you can clearly see <person player="torrey ball" race="UNK" position="DL">ball</person> out and the knees were knocked down so that play is going to stand the shame too because the way they started they moved the pocket which we talked about in the open get <person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">paulus</person> on the outside he hit his playmaker on the outside<person player="mike williams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike williams</person>with a nice crossing route and then delon carter had a couple big runs good rips in that first series but you cant put the <person player="torrey ball" race="UNK" position="DL">ball</person> on the carpet and you can call bill stewart on the phone or they wants that on the phone you cant turn the football over in conference games in big e s games anytime really but especially at home here the play stands as tall first times south florida town tomczyk the referee here this afternoon part of the big east officiating crew have a look at it just ten fumbles only three lost fumbles this is their fourth loss on the season it was a good effort on the outside they get what they want out of the sweet play but a good strip of the football again by <person player="terrell mcclain" race="UNK" position="DL">mcclain</person> and then ill give the bulls to football great field position to at the 39 yard line vj daniel drops the football on the carpet syracuse has a fax let s go get the tip number 90<person player="arthur jones" race="UNK" position="DL">arthur jones</person>earlier this week john they thought he might not play because of a light injury he comes up with a big big turnover center quarterback exchange for the <person player="jerrell young" race="UNK" position="DB">young</person> quarterback in his second start first play of the game that s not how you want to start on the road couldnt tell if that <person player="torrey ball" race="UNK" position="DL">ball</person> got up to vijay daniel s his hands but you dont want to lay it on the carpet when you get instant fuel position to giftwrap it right back to syracuse look like anytime that youre going to have a trap play that center goes away from you youre really as a quarterback have to ride that exchange switch directions once again and the handout covers up that football put down the 30yard line gain of ten for the launch i tought of ohio<person player="nate allen" race="nonwhite" position="DB">nate allen</person>making the stop wow syracuse looked at running the football big lanes huge gaps in the middle that south florida defense last week against maine you saw the numbers for touchdown three rushing and his first collegiate receiving touchdown so carter picking up where he left off couple positive plays after the fumble 713 yards as a rookie his freshman year two years ago little pump fake hollis feeling the pressure and he gets it off he throws it out of bounds that was number 97 trauma playing the nose tackle coming in putting on the pressure i like the play call by rob spent the offensive coordinators second in short they try to pump that outside ex receiver screen to<person player="mike williams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike williams</person>try to draw that second area and then get the big play out of the backfield by <person player="michael lanaris" race="UNK" position="LB">michael</person> jones on the wheel route <person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">paulus</person> didnt like what he saw and made a very positive play out of something that could have been disastrous just throws the football away now they come back with third and short third and 1 20% conversions on third down usf giving up on a 19% that s going to be interesting cause completes at the catarina and they do the change to pick up the foot down let s go back downstairs with cool consequence mike when you think about<person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">greg paulus</person>as a point guard one thing in basketball you cant do it throw the <person player="torrey ball" race="UNK" position="DL">ball</person> out of bounds have to turn over but he s learning to throw the <person player="torrey ball" race="UNK" position="DL">ball</person> away on the football field and that second down play was a great example of his maturity to thrown the <person player="torrey ball" race="UNK" position="DL">ball</person> towards the sideline learning to live another day and they convert the third down point so it s a good point that john kettering brought that up in our meeting yesterday john our producer with the rob spence the offensive coordinator about point guard contraband yeah that s a good play now spence was thinking of that minnesota game of course in overtime when he didnt throw it out of bounds his carter bounces to the outside carter penalty flag drop and he s been side to 20yard line the yellow hankie back at about the 25 alon carter coming in with 75 carries about 51 more 77 off a 10yard cleverly first up <person player="tucker baumbach" race="UNK" position="OL">tucker</person> bomb baca they senior 65 307 pound right guard called for the whole mike i would think itd be so important right now for syracuse it being the mindset that they have to come away with points after giving the football back to the bulls and then getting it back the lone carter bouncing it outside theyre really running at will on this defense but the main objective getting early in this game is to score first to really put the bulls behind and see how the <person player="jerrell young" race="UNK" position="DB">young</person> quarterback responds so on this series im not saying they have to have six but they have to get on the board coach brown saying that usf is dominated when leading at halftime as well cuts it in puts his head down inside the 30 the 28 yard line again if six that time for syracuse<person player="mike williams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike williams</person>coming in averaging 139 yards receiving why they <person player="aj love" race="UNK" position="WR">love</person> to have him back after sitting out last year he had 25 straight games just changing that but with the reception today fourth best in syracuse history and this big guy that really is a playmaker and i wouldnt be surprised if they like to throw post down in the plus territory talking with head coach <person player="doug hogue" race="UNK" position="LB">doug</person> marrone yesterday they want to get behind these safeties in the middle of the field second and 14 they have to get down to about the 15 just inside the 15 yard line playaction call looking steps up in it picked off penalty flag down but <person player="nate allen" race="nonwhite" position="DB">allen</person> what s the pick joe on his feet inside the 45 yard line the penalty back and about the 32 two flags down after the return of 40 by<person player="nate allen" race="nonwhite" position="DB">nate allen</person>boy<person player="nate allen" race="nonwhite" position="DB">nate allen</person>why mr clutch for that usf defense returns at 40 yards you go back to oh 70 at the the big int against pittsburgh the fumble recovery against west virginia personal foul jeff locke 49 in the office at pedaling beads flying on the return legal block in the back 29 under 5 feet 10 yard penalty parts out who might we talked to defensive coordinator joe tracy from the usf pools and he said his goal in each game is to get three turnovers well then on their way to that free turnover mark now theyve got two in a terrific play by<person player="nate allen" race="nonwhite" position="DB">nate allen</person>just timing that pass play up of<person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">greg paulus</person>cutting right in front of the receiver easy paul is stepping up in the pocket but a better timing play right in front of the tight end number 80<person player="nick provo" race="UNK" position="TE">nick provo</person>and then it s off to the races he s got a lot of guys in <person player="josh white" race="UNK" position="OL">white</person> shirts trying to get him into the end zone that penalty will bring the bulls off and back inside of their 30yard line but theyre accuse turnovers to today theyre plus three coming in but you cant turn the football over especially with when you get the football on a turnover in the plus territory there you go back to that minnesota game as far as turnovers that died int and of course the first play from scrimmage for <person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">greg</person> collins was snapped over his head 19 seconds later minnesota had the lead talked about joe tracy and the turnovers they got poor against florida state last week this one s complete and it s all and he put the <person player="torrey ball" race="UNK" position="DL">ball</person> on the carpet i think therapy s may have it again oh my gosh dante bupropion had two first down or close to it and now he cost it up it looked like<person player="arthur jones" race="UNK" position="DL">arthur jones</person>again came up with the football remember big number 97 is around the football in us interesting john when you think of number 97<person player="arthur jones" race="UNK" position="DL">arthur jones</person>he thought about possibly going into the nfl draft as we take another look at it well this was one heck of a hit from the secondary coming up it looked like 35<person player="mike holmes" race="UNK" position="DB">mike holmes</person>comes in from that free safety position and just jars the football loose look at this big hit i dont believe <person player="dontavia bogan" race="UNK" position="WR">bogan</person> ever saw our homes coming from the secondary then you see big 97 all six for 293 pounds on the football and syracuse again in their version of the wildcat all the salian here in syracuse<person player="antwon bailey" race="UNK" position="RB">antwon bailey</person>he s carried at 21 times and a handoff to <person player="michael lanaris" race="UNK" position="LB">michael</person> jones the sophomore he posted on the carpet the <person player="torrey ball" race="UNK" position="DL">ball</person> is free you lose the both have it or do they eileen has two or three opportunities and the bulls have it back oh my gosh i mean i thought the <person player="torrey ball" race="UNK" position="DL">ball</person> looks slippery thursday night in that west virginia game it looked like<person player="jerome murphy" race="UNK" position="DB">jerome murphy</person>from the secondary comes up and <person player="doug hogue" race="UNK" position="LB">doug</person> marrone is not happy on the orange sideline i can tell you that four minutes and 10 seconds into the <person player="torrey ball" race="UNK" position="DL">ball</person> game we turned it over five times it looked like 11 in <person player="josh white" race="UNK" position="OL">white</person> <person player="sabbath joseph" race="UNK" position="LB">joseph</person> strips the football and nobody could get on it either for syracuse or for south florida there you see the right hand right there coming in to strip the football a good defensive play by the bulls they get the football back but can they hold it<person player="sabbath joseph" race="UNK" position="LB">sabbath joseph</person>s forced to fumbles against florida state in tallahassee last saturday here we go out of the shotgun both blanchard he s hit the and syracuse going after the football once again and that s a successful play for the bulls right now theyve held onto the football five combined turnovers in the first four minutes and 10 seconds so i know <person player="jim mckenzie" race="UNK" position="OL">jim</person> leavitt is a tease right now and the offensive coordinator mike analysis is a tease because they retain the football for a second down <person player="jim mckenzie" race="UNK" position="OL">jim</person> loved it the only coach the bulls have down bokken and motion to the top of your screen bargain turn saw the orange helmets and drop the football incomplete nice nice break on the football by kevin scott the junior corner out of tamarac florida but <person player="bj daniels" race="UNK" position="QB">bj</person> daniel put the <person player="torrey ball" race="UNK" position="DL">ball</person> where he needed to put it the whole town tallahassee florida

position="WR">aj love</person>now with ten receptions on the year but a nice strong throw by <person player="bj daniels" race="UNK" position="QB">bj</person> daniel daniel s mike pork gets the call sutter steps inside the 40 yard line picks up about four on the play let s take a look at our impact players brought to you by the united states marine corps well it all starts on defense for the impact players george salvi and keyon wilson selvi everybody s allamerican and wilson leads the team with 22 tackles but<person player="carlton mitchell" race="UNK" position="WR">carlton mitchell</person>he s a big play guy on the outside already this season he has two receptions of plus 50 yards and one of 65 second and six for the bulls number seven <person player="bj daniels" race="UNK" position="QB">bj</person> daniel said last week s game was not about him it was about the balls but he said nobody listened obviously he got all the accolades for it puts his head down and picked up one maybe two the starting lineups for the bulls in south florida on the top of the screen just above the scoreboard there<person player="mike ford" race="UNK" position="RB">mike ford</person>while watching cut downs of a freshman this coming back off the suspension 14 carries now so far here the fall of 2000 theyre down for the bowl for at 49% this year but from the pocket drops it off it s complete and it s pulled in by<person player="carlton mitchell" race="UNK" position="WR">carlton mitchell</person>the leading receiver on this <person player="torrey ball" race="UNK" position="DL">ball</person> team again a five that time and boost the change to come for the first time so far in this game mike both of these quarterbacks have shown the ability to really date pool under duress good job by thera keys forcing and closing the pocket down but<person player="bj daniels" race="UNK" position="QB">bj daniels</person>has the ability to escape with his speed to the outside but still has his head down field and is aware of where his receivers are and <person player="carlton mitchell" race="UNK" position="WR">mitchell</person> makes a big third down conversion mike board remains in the backfield with<person player="bj daniels" race="UNK" position="QB">bj daniels</person>or lipstick all spin still honor speak and stumble forward most of the 25yard line let s go downstairs with quint mike yesterday when we spend time with scott shay for the defensive coordinator here at syracuse an answer about bjj we have to cage him contain him and keep him in the pocket that he can turn a foursecond play into a 12 second play and that s what you just saw on that last third down conversion and also for they really wanted to take the running ability away from daniel and make somebody else beat them defense or on the ground and that s exactly what theyre doing we havent seen <person player="bj daniels" race="UNK" position="QB">bj</person> daniel s run it effectively but he s done a nice job of getting out of the pocket so if he does get the d outside while he cuts on a dime though there s my fourth little delay or i think inside ten five buck down you are set 26 yards mike bull his second decision my cat pick your poison for usf when youre deciding who you want to run the football because i try to take away<person player="bj daniels" race="UNK" position="QB">bj daniels</person>is running ability you still have to deal with a big back and a strong back in number 26<person player="mike ford" race="UNK" position="RB">mike ford</person>he breaks two or three tackles and at his side six to 225 he s going to break both arm tackles and he gets in for the touchdown looked like he did his freshman season indeed it healthy they play 62 yards<person player="eric schwartz" race="UNK" position="K">eric schwartz</person>on for the extra point and it s good 7 minutes and 8 seconds to go in the first quarter here from syracuse the bulls on top they

job offensively and keeping syracuse off the scoreboard but i like what their chief is doing offensively theyve been able to run the football been able to throw it they just need to hold on to the football and that has not been easy to do here this afternoon the five turnovers in the game three possessions for syracuse and they turned it over all three times and theyve been able to move the football just as the bulls did last serie<person player="eric schwartz" race="UNK" position="K">eric schwartz</person>with the kick mic john said about the 50yard line go hit and he s hit hard about the 28 you know you look at the touchdown drive after the return of 23 south florida here s the touched on my bike for as a terrific job is waiting for his blocking to get out in front been plug feed did an excellent job pulling to the outside and well as jazz time the left guard and all ford had to do was wait for those two guys to clear and there was a huge hole off the right side and broke two arm tackles about the 10 yard line but eight plays 62 yards into big third down conversion on the drive at one third and eight one third and four and you look at syracuse john you talk about the three possessions three turnovers twice they started in usf territory once at the 38 once at the 33 but they copped it up both times <person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">paulus</person>

middle not too much running room theyll gain of one maybe two now let s take a look at the principal financial group edge for the game well i thought going in it would be protect call us and make us f earn it but now im going to change it to hold on to the football because syracuse has had great opportunities in the plus territory but they still have to protect the pocket in pallas keep him clean and then make the bulls earn it they cant give away big chunks of yardage on defense have a big third down play again keep in mind syracuse 20% on third down this year usf number one on the big east at 19 percent defending it all up some of the middle and it s almost picked off<person player="mike williams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike williams</person>had his hand on it a tip tips and a

great quarterback and he did such a great job in leading the bulls he became the big east alltime yards leader and here s the injury on the play we looked very harmless but he got that leg caught underneath him and i know that mike canales the offensive coordinator was so disappointed and so dejected when he would when he was hurting he was asked how he was sleeping and he said yeah im

thing as <person player="matt grothe" race="UNK" position="QB">matt</person> said he hurt his shoulder against charleston southern and he was just about the call mike pinellas up in the booth and say take him out but the defense made a good play the offense went back on the field and bang that s when he got hurt yeah you never know when it s your last play and he played a <person player="torrey ball" race="UNK" position="DL">ball</person> like it was his last play he gave it all he had every timeout turned out brophy had a hd joint sprain in his shoulder the same injury that oklahoma sam bradford had daniel s fires and it s incomplete looking for number two<person player="carlton mitchell" race="UNK" position="WR">carlton mitchell</person>we had the good throw on third down and<person

here<person player="delbert alvarado" race="UNK" position="K">delbert alvarado</person>averages about 43 it s a high kick and this one is sailing into the end john so syracuse look at the <person

to five and oh in 2009 syracuse trying to get over the 500 bar for the first time since 2006 7 nothing usf welcome back inside the carrier dome <person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">greg</person> paula s heading back out on the field after playing point guard at duke for four years he talked to us about his transition back into football i think im still learning that and there s something different that im learning each practice each game each meeting whether that s with the coverage rotation whether that s just feel more comfortable in the pocket when to step up when to leave the pocket so im still learning as i go and i really like the process of trying to get to where id like to be well john can jamie during his high school day six new york passing records 11763 yards 152 touchdowns from 42 games and he started hot today with three or four but since then now he s over his last three with one interception so not all on <person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">greg</person> paul s but things are there to take advantage of in this bulls defense wall plays 44 yards of total offense so far for paulo some company watch the fella looking down the field has one he has the <person player="torrey ball" race="UNK" position="DL">ball</person> williams crop decide the 25 brought down by quentin <person player="quenton washington" race="UNK" position="DB">washington</person> the sophomore quarterback for the gain of 54 for the cuse there s the poke pattern that head coach <person player="doug hogue" race="UNK" position="LB">doug</person> marrone was talking to me about yesterday they want to take advantage at the middle of the field and get it to their playmaker<person player="mike williams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike williams</person>a terrific catch a good adjustment to the football call us after playaction pass nobody in the middle the field he tried to make it easy on his big <person player="josh white" race="UNK" position="OL">white</person> out and he threw a strike down the middle for a big play now the orange again in positive field position today s first and 10 line is brought to you by overstockcom the orange on the move again inside bull territory trailing by 7 there s the stallion<person player="antwon bailey" race="UNK" position="RB">antwon bailey</person>we could see that 20 or 25 times today according to the offense according to rob spent tackle made by<person player="craig marshall" race="UNK" position="DL">craig marshall</person>you know rob spence with donek clemson of course we all know thunder lightning james davison cj spiller s he said coming here you find out who you have and he said as far as running backs he really likes these running backs he says he s not going to compare him with the guys down in clemson but theyre almost in the same league well theyre hardnosed runners they run north and south theyve got a little bit of burst they can catch the football as well so i would be pleased as well coming into the situation at running back trips at the top of your screen <person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">paulus</person> stops fires looking for jones and he overshoots him<person player="mike jones" race="UNK" position="RB">mike jones</person>number 37 a sophomore from middleton pennsylvania a <person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">greg</person> wallace we mentioned 44 yards and 12 plays coming in to describe to two fumbles and int a 25 yard punt this drives so far 56 yards for <person player="doug hogue" race="UNK" position="LB">doug</person> ron wouldnt be surprised and see that set later on in the game from head coach <person player="doug hogue" race="UNK" position="LB">doug</person> marrone and maybe have his quarterback<person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">greg paulus</person>looked like a pass and maybe used that quarterback running ability on the quarterback draw nobody in the middle of the field for the bulls on that last play third and seven all 20 of time fires and it s almost picked off knocked down again penalty flag<person player="mistral raymond" race="UNK" position="DB">mistral raymond</person>made the defensive play but he might have had his left arm wrapped around the receiver it was funny because the receiver i think the <person player="torrey ball" race="UNK" position="DL">ball</person> was tipped though and that s why the officials are talking i think the <person player="torrey ball" race="UNK" position="DL">ball</person> was tipped and theyre going to allow the contact in the by <person player="mistral raymond" race="UNK" position="DB">raymond</person> in the secondary because there was a the back official was right there in the end zone did not call it the field side official called the play so they may call this back off im not sure looked like it looked like the <person player="torrey ball" race="UNK" position="DL">ball</person> was tipped so foul on the play were going to take another look <person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">paulus</person> has what he wants down the middle of the field and that s where the <person player="torrey ball" race="UNK" position="DL">ball</person> was deflected right there at the linebacker spot so that s going to nullify the pass interference in the back end by mental <person player="mistral raymond" race="UNK" position="DB">raymond</person> the homecoming crowd here at syracuse didnt like it but to ryan a <person player="ryan lichtenstein" race="UNK" position="K">lichtenstein</person> will try out 40yard field goal one of the early success stories in the big east conference he s number one in the big east right now im going to go upstairs and take a look at this one and make sure they get the call right so look and cena will take that <person player="rob long" race="UNK" position="P">long</person> walk back to the sidelines and and <person player="doug hogue" race="UNK" position="LB">doug</person> marrone this still could work in favor of course you have to look and find an indisputable video evidence when theyre upstairs looking at it were going to take another look at this it looks like keyon wilson here is going to be the linebacker that tips the football let s take a look at right hand right there looks like it deflects the football ever so slightly and that allows to contact in a secondary were going to slow it down right there i mean it looks like the back end starts to wobble as the <person player="torrey ball" race="UNK" position="DL">ball</person> gets by wilson which indicate that either uh place a is s called forth doubt i think the <person player="torrey ball" race="UNK" position="DL">ball</person> was just ever so slightly tipped and that allows the contact in the secondary and it allows head coach <person player="jim mckenzie" race="UNK" position="OL">jim</person> leavitt to breathe a little bit easier what do you think about the kicker the unfresh minh that i am but a <person player="tyson butler" race="UNK" position="DB">tyson</person> i dont think so i think he s so happy to be out there he s going to he did a boot it through no matter what he s a walkon on scholarship now after a couple of kickers left the team he s seven of eight and he s three for three from this distance from forty to forty nine this one from forty up and it s good brian looked and seen the freshman now eight of nine in 2009 number one in the big east conference already has the gamewinner against northwestern so life is pretty good right now for the <person player="jerrell young" race="UNK" position="DB">young</person> freshman a nice job by syracuse taking advantage of a big play opportunity from <person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">paulus</person> to<person player="mike williams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike williams</person>head coach <person player="doug hogue" race="UNK" position="LB">doug</person> marrone talking about the deflection in the defensive backfield still wanted to get seven points to tie this at seven all but they do come away with points with 150 left to go in the first quarter but the big play in that drive was the pass later <person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">greg</person> hauls out the play accident really sucks everybody up inside and it s one on one on the outside and we talked to head coach <person player="doug hogue" race="UNK" position="LB">doug</person> marrone yesterday said he wanted to throw that post play at least five six seven times in this game today because he thought that he could get the middle of the field but in the middle of the field you can see the coverage there s no secondary help in the middle of the field back here so that s where they want to attack after playaction theyre able to get their biggest playmaker on the field<person player="mike williams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike williams</person>there s a vacated spot youre able to get 50 60 yards at a clip and makes it a lot easier for your offense this four point you know it s amazing you looked at great policy had a 346 yard passing game against northwestern donovan mcnabb and don macpherson two of the best to play at the school they never had a 346 year some games well they ran it pretty effectively when they were here i can tell you that there s the kick and it s going to be taken out of the endzone hogan and he couple over the 20 dropped at about the 23 yard line on baby of hogan returns to 24 yards enough to make the stop before syracuse number 22 that said<person player="torian phillips" race="UNK" position="WR">torian phillips</person>7:3 bulls coming to the game a lot of people in the stadium talking about the the fact that the bullet only favored by six six and a half points coming in here and you talked about the spread you know the bulls against their cuse over the last four years being so great at the start of the game it is a bit of a surprise but theyre just been playing well as of late <person player="torrey ball" race="UNK" position="DL">ball</person> at the 20 for daniel s play action steps up plays fine is so some of that speed but number 32 dug hole saying hey im quicker youre not going to get around me hold the junior when the yonkers new york comes up from his linebacker spot to make the time he had the former running back turn linebacker has some jets of his own and i think that <person player="bj daniels" race="UNK" position="QB">bj</person> daniel took for granted that he was going to get a regular speed on that linebacker and it was a nice play by <person player="doug hogue" race="UNK" position="LB">doug</person> hope all three of these linebackers former running back so they all play fast and physical defensive coordinator scott shafer says <person player="doug hogue" race="UNK" position="LB">doug</person> howe he know he may have a chance at the next level to continue on if they put on some pounds but great pursuit he always has his hands around the football that goes down as the sack so that s the 11th for syracuse this year <person player="bj daniels" race="UNK" position="QB">daniels</person> rolls out of the pocket fires they metal down the field and a great defensive play as number 26 down there that s kevin scott the junior from your alma mater st thomas aquinas yeah st thomas aquinas high school a junior on the tamarac florida making a nice play on the football that was a good throw by <person player="bj daniels" race="UNK" position="QB">bj</person> daniel he gets out of the pocket he does need to put a little bit more air under this football and let his receiver go but a good play on the football by scott and now a big third down situation defensively for the orange bowl two of three on third down so far here this afternoon in the dome mentioned earlier in the broadcast 49% on the year inside of it in the first quarter out of the shotgun playaction <person player="bj daniels" race="UNK" position="QB">daniels</person> look and he fires people looking for <person player="aj love" race="UNK" position="WR">love</person> and he overshoots him by about five yards nikko scott on the covered side time for syracuse he s got an arm doesnt it night yet he does nice defensive stand that time by derrick use that<person player="bj daniels" race="UNK" position="QB">bj daniels</person>looked at his wide out<person player="aj love" race="UNK" position="WR">aj love</person>and it was a miscommunication <person player="aj love" race="UNK" position="WR">love</person> saw his quarterback break containing started to come back to the quarterback just as <person player="bj daniels" race="UNK" position="QB">bj</person> daniel let it go so <person player="aj love" race="UNK" position="WR">love</person> may be stopped on the ride a little bit but he was trying to come back and help his quarterback<person player="delbert alvarado" race="UNK" position="K">delbert alvarado</person>will punt just over his 10yard line<person player="donte davis" race="UNK" position="WR">donte davis</person>is standing at his 35 so syracuse should and i emphasize should have good field position as they open up the second quarter this one goes off the side of his foot a little hits at the 40 takes the bull bounce down to about the 30 and it might have been gone closer to the 31 yard line 47 yard punt dont return for searcy all right john let s take a look out the principal financial group edge to the game for south florida well i thought offensively they needed to use their playmakers and plant it in forward in the backfield and <person player="carlton mitchell" race="UNK" position="WR">mitchell</person> on the outside <person player="aj love" race="UNK" position="WR">aj</person> loves get the football and spread it out and then defensively keep the heat on<person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">greg paulus</person>and keep the heat on that running game try to make them onedimensional and that s what <person player="jim mckenzie" race="UNK" position="OL">jim</person> leavitt would <person player="aj love" race="UNK" position="WR">love</person> to do and mike and also their defensive coordinator joe treci just keep the pressure on paulson force him into bad situation 32 seconds to go in the first quarter orange on their home coming down by 473 <person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">paulus</person> dumps it daily he s got some running room and the first down up over the 45 close to the 50 yard line in of 64 antoine <person player="antwon bailey" race="UNK" position="RB">bailey</person> the 58 sophomore from landover maryland tonight call on first down by rob s offense the offense coordinator getting that speed to come up field on that defensive front and nobody in that back seven for the bulls defensively and they move the chains very easily the last two possessions for the orange big plays on first down last theory a big broke down the middle to<person player="mike williams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike williams</person>now you got a screen pass and it put syracuse in a nice situation oh scott shafer the defensive coordinator for syracuse told us yesterday everything is overrated we can play with these guys were not afraid of track times were not afraid of vertical jump but right now theyre down for seven three to the balls of us get back inside the carrier dome for the second quarter here in syracuse right after this time up welcome back inside the carrier dome seven three bulls on top of the orange so mike gleason john to jimmy quinn kuznick and john you look at the first 15 minutes kind of interesting we look at the key players yes the bulls come out first offensive play they get a quarterback center exchange problem it turns the football over to the orange but they reciprocate and <person player="michael lanaris" race="UNK" position="LB">michael</person> jones putting it on the carpet and they give it right back to the bulls but bulls were able to take advantage and get outside the pocket offensively and theyve done a nice job of trying to get it to pearl <person player="carlton mitchell" race="UNK" position="WR">mitchell</person> on the outside and that led to a bike port big run off the right side and a touchdown so five turnovers in the first four minutes and 10 seconds was really a story of the first quarter and now syracuse trying to take advantage again a excellent field position theyve done a nice job on first down in the last two series to get themselves closer to scoring position and you look at the numbers i said an interesting first 15 minutes both head coach is probably a different word yeah i mean five turnovers in four minutes and 10 seconds the first 410 here we go the second 15 minutes now <person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">paulus</person> at the controls for syracuse out of the shotgun averaging about 230 passing yards again just shy of a hundred yards rushing bollocks here comes the rush fiers has his man markus sailes first down <person player="jerrell young" race="UNK" position="DB">young</person> sophomore from christian brothers academy a gain of 10 on the play nice read by <person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">greg</person> paul s because the bulls tried to bring some heat and the most interesting thing so far through the first 15 minutes and early into the second quarter is really really havent mentioned george salvi s name or<person player="jason pierrepaul" race="UNK" position="DL">jason pierrepaul</person>the pressure inside by <person player="terrell mcclain" race="UNK" position="DL">mcclain</person> and <person player="aaron harris" race="UNK" position="DL">harris</person> syracuse is neutralized the big front four of the bulls and that s been a big story of them really having controlled a football im glad you brought that up <person player="doug hogue" race="UNK" position="LB">doug</person> marrone said hed kick himself if the defensive ends beat them because they worked so hard to make sure that didnt happen ollis keeps the <person player="torrey ball" race="UNK" position="DL">ball</person> inside the 40yard line were inside the carrier dome in syracuse it s homecoming 2009 for the orange says the orange take on the bulls of usf along with john can jamie fantastic mike gleason here great daddy with us on the big east network game of the week mike this might be another opportunity just as <person player="doug hogue" race="UNK" position="LB">doug</person> marrone would like to take advantage of the middle of the field to try to get his playmaker up at the top of the screen<person player="mike williams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike williams</person>a chance at that post pattern again trying to make a big play ends up at the top of the screen there trying to make a big play on on second down here all us again the quarterback draw not afraid again here comes up and mr <person player="mistral raymond" race="UNK" position="DB">raymond</person> that lowers the boom <person player="mistral raymond" race="UNK" position="DB">raymond</person> s a good hitter we talked about his athleticism and his leadership he s getting those guys to the line of scrimmage quickly to try to snap the football and picks up the first out on a quick step may have called timeout the bulls may have called timeout before that <person player="torrey ball" race="UNK" position="DL">ball</person> was snapped hello south florida good call john at least them with too <person player="jim mckenzie" race="UNK" position="OL">jim</person> leavitt 91 and 52<person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">greg paulus</person>s first big east game and they talked to us about facing the bulls in south florida well they do a lot of things really well defensively the speed and athleticism what they have at all positions it s not just keyed in on one area the t line the linebackers the secondary from what ive seen on film you know they cover so much ground in such a short period of time so where you might think there s a window you can fit a <person player="torrey ball" race="UNK" position="DL">ball</person> in you know a closes so fast so put a little bit more the outside you know try to anticipate that i anticipate the speed they rush to rush the quarterback and they really put good pressure on you know chasing in try to keep in the pocket they make plays everywhere so these are the things that we need to be aware of anticipate and do a really good job of taking care of the <person player="torrey ball" race="UNK" position="DL">ball</person> and moving the chains gregg qualis the quarterback is proud parents in the stands of course he s from syracuse leading christian brothers academy to a 2004 state championship right here in this building belong carter five two leans forward gets the first down are pretty darn close nice tuck an effort by number three for terrific part running and you mentioned rob spent liking these running backs to the clemson pair thunder and lightning that time it was thunder and lightning in one run because he was stopped right at the line of scrimmage and now theyre fischels are going to bring the chains out to see if indeed he had enough for the first down so a nice job on third down and short by the lone carter he coach schaefer up there in the booth the defensive coordinator rob s fence of course at clemson for the last couple of years and nice round of applause for the oranges the lawn carter picks up the first down lobs fence right there and <person player="doug hogue" race="UNK" position="LB">doug</person> marrone you know it s funny rob spence talking about rob spence it s amazing how before policy even came onto the picture ill finish this story right after this play but before he came out of the picture he told <person player="doug hogue" race="UNK" position="LB">doug</person> maroney said we need a point guard to run this offense and that all of you believe in destiny or not there s some razzle dazzle the first a man is carter s picks up a couple all be holds and shows up on the doorstep but a point guard we ended up getting somebody that could make those second decisions and can see the entire field just like a point guard we see the entire course so you know the quarterback is a heady quarterback and he likes to take chances but he knows the risk limitations that <person player="doug hogue" race="UNK" position="LB">doug</person> marrone has put on that position but it allows him to be himself and i think as the season grows on youre going to see direct call us grow in to a fine quarterback <person player="doug hogue" race="UNK" position="LB">doug</person> marrone kind of tongueincheek said ok well see if youre well that s right youve got your point guard let s see if it works all right now they trail by four seven two three <person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">paulus</person> drops back fires finds his man that s the freshman <person player="alec lemon" race="UNK" position="WR">lemon</person> and <person player="alec lemon" race="UNK" position="WR">lemon</person> move to change another first out <person player="alec lemon" race="UNK" position="WR">alec</person> lemons but the maryland state record last year with 1000 over 1600 yards beyond wolfson comes up with a cue stop where you went down theyre accusing control the second quarter so far theyre doing a nice job of spreading the football out mixing the run and pass and not allowing those defensive ends for south florida to pin their ears back and come and collapse that talk a lot of screens a lot of misdirection can snap count changes all it s doing an excellent job of running this off <person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">paulus</person> at the redzone mark 20 yard line comes back william glenn puts his head down inside the can another first down for syracuse deon wilson again on the stop for the bulls as he gets them out of bounds but not before they move the change in at 11 first and goal now for syracuse just like<person player="mike williams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike williams</person>blew a tire on that screen coming out holding a shoe but a good job of distributing the football a nice blocks on the outside and<person player="mike williams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike williams</person>uses his speed to get around quentin <person player="quenton washington" race="UNK" position="DB">washington</person> the cornerback and gets that <person player="torrey ball" race="UNK" position="DL">ball</person> on the outside uses that free arm to stiff arm to get outside and move the chains again for the orange that are knocking on the door inside the 10 yard line 82 percent success rate in the red zone 17 possessions 10 touchdowns for field goal falls on the

my schedule and make the call i think that s pretty classic i think it s great he just made the best offensive lineman for the pool sampson genus whip at the line of scrimmage daniel s circles 1097 in pursuit daniel s turns it up and he pays the price wow there for penalty slide coming down late gain of 3 on the play but john one thing syracuse has been doing face that 51b says 15yard penalty first up putting helmets on the <person player="torrey ball" race="UNK" position="DL">ball</person> but that time they grabbed the facemask that s the infraction well it s an attack defensa defensive coordinator scott shafer is put in and the kids like to think theyre in attack mode all the time and that time they made a really good play they botched the screen play to the wide side but it looked like<person player="andrew lewis" race="UNK" position="DL">andrew lewis</person>in his pursuit of <person player="bj daniels" race="UNK" position="QB">bj</person> daniel s may get the facemask right

palace 17 plays 120 yards no turnovers they look good on stairs in the clock with quinn it s amazing the more codes as we talked around the bigge how impressed they are with what brett halls has been able to do in a very short timeframe the guys did not play spring football left here the challenge first of all learn the schemes with decker both transform his body a point guards body to a college quarterback cloudy he basically missed four years of weight training he s tried to do that in a short period of time experience a little dead arm period in august as well while he was competing for the starting clock but he has bounced back his arm strength now getting stronger and stronger each week next went and biggie s football fan shiqi followed quint and our biggies network drew on twitter at twittercom/zeromd geeks with us and all of your fellow fans of course well be a real tweet that is on the card i know i know just read you stick in his grip you know it s a good point that the quit

said great fifth grade but not a big basketball fan first he was in the nfl in rome same time in new orleans led the nfl twice and total offense you know those offensive linemen they dont get around much over the middle that s once picked off<person player="jerome murphy" race="UNK" position="DB">jerome murphy</person>that s his second this year and nick probowl was trying to go to the middle john you mentioned the fact that said they had a hit for fiveo post this year robbo just coming off an injury and he s down again on the field well look like and paul <person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">paulus</person> was anticipating<person player="mike williams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike williams</person>to get into that window it was in between a post and a quick slant and it looked like<person player="mike williams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike williams</person>backed off of the route just as <person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">paulus</person> was stepping into the throw and that led the football right to<person player="jerome murphy" race="UNK" position="DB">jerome murphy</person>who gladly accepted and you can see <person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">paulus</person> s dejection and that offensive backfield thinking he thought<person player="mike williams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike williams</person>was going to sprint through that window he is anticipating throwing the balls gone it looked like williams backed off of the route good pickup i just saw <person player="jerome murphy" race="UNK" position="DB">murphy</person> with the pick and i saw robbo go down but youre right he was looking for<person player="mike williams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike williams</person>over the middle that s the fourth turnover now for syracuse they came in plus two on the year let s hope dick <person player="nick provo" race="UNK" position="TE">provo</person> is okay because it looked like he just got the the knee run into on the on the roll by <person player="jerome murphy" race="UNK" position="DB">murphy</person> left <person player="jerome murphy" race="UNK" position="DB">murphy</person> here he just ducked down and that leg was extended and he gets upended he immediately goes and grabs that left knee robbo averaging 14 yards of cats this year missed a couple of games because after being injured in that minnesota opener well fun south florida here coming out i might go play action and try to use<person player="bj daniels" race="UNK" position="QB">bj daniels</person>either on the edge or throwing the football because syracuse has had the answer to the running attack so far so now there s six turnovers in the game daniel s fires <person player="carlton mitchell" race="UNK" position="WR">mitchell</person> top of your screen a good pursuit and the kevin scott is up to finish him off<person player="mike holmes" race="UNK" position="DB">mike holmes</person>safety you make an initial contact on the coverage <person player="mike holmes" race="UNK" position="DB">holmes</person> bounce from the corner to safety last year and scott shafer said is much more at home in 59 he s a football player and i knew that a couple years ago when he was a freshman making plays on special teams and i like the way syracuse is attacking the football theyre running around and playing aggressive defense and that s what defensive coordinator shot see for <person player="aj love" race="UNK" position="WR">love</person> to see like forward on the backfield on with<person player="bj daniels" race="UNK" position="QB">bj daniels</person>second and seven and it steps up fires looks fines touchdown<person player="carlton mitchell" race="UNK" position="WR">carlton mitchell</person>33 yards his second this year the junior from the lutz florida the redshirt freshman at quarterback is growing up in a hurry watch him step up and let the pressure go right by him he eludes it and just had a knack for getting up into that pocket he knew nobody was down in centerfield and kevin scott was beaten on the post pattern by<person player="carlton mitchell" race="UNK" position="WR">carlton mitchell</person>we talked about him being an impact player and a bigtime yardage gainer on the outside as they attack on the extra point to make it 14 to 6 hole but a great job by vijay <person player="bj daniels" race="UNK" position="QB">daniels</person> finding his weapon on the outside and how about john that pocket presence it s hard to teach that ism you dont teach this this is instinct and you just have to feel the pressure step up deliver the football and good things happen to you lbj jános just through his fifth touchdown strike the season 606 to go 14:6 now as both the syracuse turnovers resolved in touchdowns for the bold i should say both two of the four turnovers falco syracuse he s only can touchdown for the bowl he s got a word on the tight end<person player="nick provo" race="UNK" position="TE">nick provo</person>injured his left knee and probably wont see him very uncertain about his return i would doubt if he saw him for the rest of the afternoon yeah i didnt look good mike the way that he he buckled over and just immediately grabbed that left knee<person

runs into a lot of traffic it s over the 25 run out of bounds i of the 28th the return of a lot of yards and let s take a look at that pocket presence once again the pocket president youre going to see mike youre going to see<person player="mike holmes" race="UNK" position="DB">mike holmes</person>come out of the center of the field and he s got mantoman coverage but the outside technique down here by the corner backs going to allow the middle of the field wide open for the post pattern kevin scott at the quarterback position played outside technique and man coverage and that allowed the middle of the field to be wide open youre going to see <person player="mike holmes" race="UNK" position="DB">holmes</person> come from this position inside and he s going to have the first back out strong he s looking for anybody nobody comes out so he s going to try to help but he s much too late <person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">paulus</person> under center this time this is carter ill stripping to jump over the 30 i sent at that time i go on counter gain of six a right mike delong carter with that jump step to the outside he he lost the shoe on the play but a good positive start for syracuse on first down with 540 left to go before halftime in county they would <person player="aj love" race="UNK" position="WR">love</person> to put seven points on the board and not have to settle for another field goal before halftime carter a former mr football in the state of ohio and you of course were born in youngstown you know you they take their football pretty serious they sure do in that state as a matter of fact <person player="doug hogue" race="UNK" position="LB">doug</person> marrone talked yesterday about infiltrating more into the buckeye state to get some players here s williams first down third few come on his feet and he couple to the 45 drop it 2:13 for mike alia mike really good read by <person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">greg</person> calls on the play had a swing pass to the whiteside he let the backer just expand with the swing pass and that allowed<person player="mike williams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike williams</person>he s run a 10yard stop he turns around gets the <person player="torrey ball" race="UNK" position="DL">ball</person> right on the number one number in the middle of his chest and then he goes to make a couple more yards though ninth decision and good timing by <person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">greg</person> paulin i mentioned williams averaging 109 yards a game at six catches for a hundred and six already here this afternoon he still have 447 to go before halftime <person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">paulus</person> he said himself he had <person player="alec lemon" race="UNK" position="WR">lemon</person> the freshman running down the middle of the field looked like he was wide open unless the nickelback mike s and <person player="tyson butler" race="UNK" position="DB">butler</person> was a playing awesome back there the deep station it looked like <person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">greg</person> paul s who s trying to get the football to the short side but im sure they may come back to that play when they get him on the sidelines and say listen when we do that again take a peek back side because you had <person player="alec lemon" race="UNK" position="WR">lemon</person> down the middle<person player="antwon bailey" race="UNK" position="RB">antwon bailey</person>now behind <person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">paulus</person> who will take the snap under center vollis the drop play <person player="antwon bailey" race="UNK" position="RB">bailey</person> and he moved to change another first down for two it was settled that time<person player="nate allen" race="nonwhite" position="DB">nate allen</person>coming up in the free safety spot to make the make her stop boy good job of running in a great job by this offensive line <person player="tucker baumbach" race="UNK" position="OL">tucker</person> bombeck at that right

do a great job of really vacating the bulls in the middle that defense and weve talked about this front seven being so tough we havent talked much about them 334 remaining before halftime <person player="antwon bailey" race="UNK" position="RB">bailey</person> takes the pitch turns it up and he s dropped it about the 40 were inside the carrier dome in syracuse great to have you with us for the big east network game of the week along with john and jenni quinn fest and godlike gleason as the bulls you see the numbers there they leave the series for ole and <person player="doug hogue" race="UNK" position="LB">doug</person> marrone said this is the one team in the big east that has been a lopsided score over the last four years probably an average of 35 to aid in getting worse i remember ive been royster a penn state after penn state played the syracuse team he said it wasnt the same guys we played last year know and the good thing about their keys after all the turnovers theyre only down 14 sixth or one play away from getting right back in this game wallace looks and he had his man <person player="cody catalina" race="UNK" position="TE">catalina</person> the junior from rossdale pennsylvania i think he wanted to run with that football before he had his hand under control he drops it incomplete so third night now for syracuse that was a good job by keyon wilson the linebacker the senior out of jacksonville florida staying home this guy you want to talk about tough he had a groin injury last week going into the florida state game he s played through it that week and now today in the right hand he injured against florida state 25 stitches in that hand and didnt bat an eye so this is a guy that you know you have to drag him off the field you can see his numbers on the season one forced fumble but he s a heart and soul that defense from that linebacker spot joe tracy the defensive coordinator thought he was done for the day and he came back after getting those 25 stitches and im ready to go coach and so tracy calls his band everybody looked at tracy like he was crazy yeah 14:6 are coming up on the biggie spent work halftime report drake wallace will sit down with the john during condemning scorner and quit visits to syracuse worldrenowned a school of public communications and of course well break down the orange offense in this week s big east break down for some highlights anonymous it all coming up on the big east network halftime report which is only 248 to go as great carlos cam in two touchdowns more than ints he threw a couple of picks here today so he s dead even in that regard dow six and six looking forward to the conversation you had with the<person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">greg paulus</person>right after this play got ask a quick question wallace and he s going down and that will go down as they sack and like<person player="aaron harris" race="UNK" position="DL">aaron harris</person>was the first guy there but a lot of guys forcing great call us mike in an uncomfortable position trying to get back an initially good protection but theyre the first guy there is carell mcclane 97 and then<person player="aaron harris" race="UNK" position="DL">aaron harris</person>cleans it up form both those inside guys took a lot of snaps last season and joe tracy said it s really been paying off early this season why my yeah minus seven on the play i was going to ask you your thoughts of <person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">paulus</person> a lot of people didnt think he could do it apologize not really because he played at such a high level at duke playing basketball and he was really known for his football just as much a basketball coming out of high school so you know four years is a <person player="rob long" race="UNK" position="P">long</person> time but if you really have that desire and that passion to do it you know you have the ability you had it just a short time ago so i wasnt surprised but i am surprised and watching him play and see how efficient he s become from the first game on he threw he has couple picks today but he s thrown in the right areas in the right spots and the right reads and he s getting people set up in the right spot offensively getting in and out of a huddle and he s doing it with efficiency so i like the way <person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">greg</person> pollock plays the quarterback position 28 yard punt that time by<person player="rob long" race="UNK" position="P">rob long</person>now it s hard to believe college basketball season is right around the corner dont miss the basketball powerhouse showdown between syracuse and florida in the third annual sec big east invitational held at the st pete times forum in tampa that will be coming up on december 10th for tickets and travel visit sec big east invitational calm minute 57 to go vijay <person player="bj daniels" race="UNK" position="QB">daniels</person> out of the shotgun bowl planter gets the call spins and he goes down over the 20 yard line of up to 23 looks like their keys may use one of their timeouts here with 147 left and counting for half times talking about <person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">paulus</person> mike 10 of 24 147 he does have the two interceptions but he s done a good job of keeping syracuse in the game now this defense has to do a good job and you see <person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">greg</person> on the sidelines the defense has to do a better job now keeping usf out of the end zone and <person player="jim mckenzie" race="UNK" position="OL">jim</person> leavitt to get any more points before halftime <person player="jim mckenzie" race="UNK" position="OL">jim</person> leavitt talking with him by phone this week and instead the florida state game was they the biggest one in school history of course they beat number two auburn a couple of years before that within a couple of days later he said you know what it s just one game and he said we really havent played anybody so it was our first real test of the year well it s one game but it was one big game for all those fans of south florida and he asked him about his celebration way so i got to celebrate in the locker room a little bit on the bus on the way home but that was it you know so he enjoyed it but for a very short time second and six for the bowl on top 14 to 6 and then averaging about 38 points the game and there s a penalty flag down and a good pursuit up front for that syracuse defense as<person player="chandler jones" race="UNK" position="DL">chandler jones</person>the younger brother of<person player="arthur jones" race="UNK" position="DL">arthur jones</person>holes are going back timeout syracuse your final turnout tomtom s lickity referee second timeout informing us that syracuse was exhausted all their timeouts here in the first half so <person player="doug hogue" race="UNK" position="LB">doug</person> marrone and <person player="jim mckenzie" race="UNK" position="OL">jim</person> levesque two going at it for the first time around of course of leaving the new orleans saints last year you know<person player="bj daniels" race="UNK" position="QB">bj daniels</person>earlier of quinn was talking about<person player="matt grothe" race="UNK" position="QB">matt grothe</person>and vijay <person player="bj daniels" race="UNK" position="QB">daniels</person> of ej <person player="bj daniels" race="UNK" position="QB">daniels</person> only a redshirt freshman and stepping into a program that <person player="jim mckenzie" race="UNK" position="OL">jim</person> levitz built and boy they this is one program that certainly took off went 1a in 2001 conference usa and oh three bcs the big east in 2005 finding the number two in the bolt a couple of years ago and <person player="jim mckenzie" race="UNK" position="OL">jim</person> leavitt said they can now when he retires there is going to buy season tickets who just watch for football because he s a bull throught room i could see him on a boat eating chicken wings in the back of the boat and watching game watch the bulls live because you know he started this with one trailer and it s come do you know on the road at tallahassee last week taking down florida say so oh blanchard troubles on the carpet and you orange threw a minute 37 to go or have the <person player="torrey ball" race="UNK" position="DL">ball</person> inside the 15 yard line number 24 let s <person player="max suter" race="UNK" position="DB">max</person> seward great opportunity though the orange can capitalize that s the last thing you want to have happen if youre a bull on offense is to give up the football terrific hit just a helmet right on the football by number 25 look like durrell smith out of that linebacker position he has two forced fumbles on the season make it three just a terrific tackle there s the last thing you want to do is give up the football this deep in your own end with only a minute 36 left to go before halftime let s see if ill call us after this timeout by the bold looks like they werent ready to go back on defense by getting back to those linebackers for syracuse as you mentioned all former running backs and the darrell smith forcing that fumble get ten tackles against penn state ten against northwestern it s ten against maine i mean these guys he goes to 36 hole goes to 23 and<person player="ej carter" race="UNK" position="LB">ej carter</person>the will the true freshman at 222 these guys put 10 15 20 pounds on and they could play with anybody just a great job by girls myth out of that linebacker position and then mack souter gets up and recovers the fumble but there s the form tackle right there head on the football nothing that moses planter could do on the play but try to crawl and get the football but mack souter beats into the punch and now the key for syracuse is a minute 36 no timeout that s plenty of time with the <person player="torrey ball" race="UNK" position="DL">ball</person> on the 14 yard line to get points they want to protect it theyd like to get 7 to close this gap but they have to come away with positive points get points on this drive has been huge to get the now because there it is football game now theyre going to put south florida on their heels as they can narrow the gap to one covered by experiencies first out south florida we charge with the timeout so <person player="jim mckenzie" race="UNK" position="OL">jim</person> lovitz are charged with the timeout the ruling stands it was a fumble recoveries they had them take another look at it and here comes <person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">paulus</person> and company now down 14 6 with a 36 to go before halftime on homecoming the chance to check out this bull deep in florida

position="TE">catalina</person> close to the 10 yard line russell down by a host of bull welcome syracuse mike here on third down you want to throw the football in the end zone take a shot getting coming away with six points there you dont want to throw it underneath take a shot in the end zone if you dont like it throw it away and at least you come away with a field goal opportunity to keep yourself an opportunity to get six points at about the 5yard line they can still pick up a first down with 35 seconds to go little pump fake were gonna save glands glands as you talked about earlier on the broadcast jump all even up and god give your best player an opportunity to go up and get the football and that s exactly what brett wallace did on that third down opportunity he hung the football up with enough air even though there was a safety over the top he s going to bet<person player="mike williams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike williams</person>can outjump anybody in that secondary for the football and under thrown pass a great job of going up and getting the football and closing this cushion to possibly one point let them steam right down the middle he does exactly that 29 seconds to go before halftime 1413 syracuse within one in williamstown seven catches 117 yards in a touchdown he s having himself a career day you can see the safety over the top he s going to go over but<person player="mike williams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike williams</person>going to out jump most defenders for the bulls in the secondary actually they overrun the past and it was lucky that the <person player="torrey ball" race="UNK" position="DL">ball</person> was underthrown call us at a nice job of putting enough air under the football to give<person player="mike williams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike williams</person>a chance to play the football when <person player="quenton washington" race="UNK" position="DB">washington</person> number two doesnt even jump there s a quick pump fake on the outside that allows william to get around <person player="quenton washington" race="UNK" position="DB">washington</person> and up ahead of <person player="mistral raymond" race="UNK" position="DB">raymond</person> the safety coming across from the middle of the field great athleticism shown there by<person player="mike williams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike williams</person>great shot by our camera guys because you saw number 95 trying to come in on the edge and nick s fellow the left tackle doing a great job of keeping him off of his quarterback here s the number 7 for 117 he s in good company come into the game juilliard of cincinnati each had seven catches of twenty yards or more and williams sitting out last year six to 204 pounds great size keep in mind in 2070 at ten touchdown catches last year syracuse had 11 for the team for the entire season losing him last year due to academic problems really hurt their offense you can tell how much it means to<person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">greg paulus</person>in the orange about getting him back on the playing field and being so productive but you can see the leadership quality of paul s going around saying hey guys were right in this game you know let s keep it up let s keep it going were going to win this football game and that s what you expect out of your leader at quarterback along with the short kick <person player="dontavia bogan" race="UNK" position="WR">bogan</person> again at about the 16 yard line turn slips and falls down over the 25 with 25 seconds ago early turn of ten so the bulls lead it by one 1413 25 seconds to go take a knee when you go for well you got one timeout remaining i dont know if you either two schools about either take a knee or you get back in shotgun and try to get<person player="carlton mitchell" race="UNK" position="WR">carlton mitchell</person>on a go route just throw it up if you throw a pick no big deal it happens a fifty or sixty yards down the field they already have three trisko time future saying repeating over there number 41 coming up that brian gilliam a junior youngstown ohio your birthplace john a lot of dejection on the south florida pool sidelines you can see a lot of guys in <person player="josh white" race="UNK" position="OL">white</person> jersey kind of stumbling to the locker room where derek you says little hop in their step and sprinting to the locker room so this momentum has changed drastically a couple times with all these turnovers in the first half but it s a one game onepoint game quinn standing by with <person player="doug hogue" race="UNK" position="LB">doug</person> brown when coach how do you best describe the importance of that last touchdown well it s important you know we got it back to it on one point and though we have to do is stop turning the <person player="torrey ball" race="UNK" position="DL">ball</person> over and execute them better how do you begin to address the turnovers with your team but we got a hold on the football is the first to win address at halftime thanks thank you thanks quick you know <person player="doug hogue" race="UNK" position="LB">doug</person> marrone said earlier in the week get john that would be a challenge for any nfl offensive line against this usf defensive front pretty good job of misdirection keeping away from those big guys thought theyve done a great job of moving the football sideline to sideline and keeping those guys off of <person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">greg</person> paul while saturday afternoon in syracuse tons of turnovers but big mole as john mentioned just shift it to syracuse halftime 1413 bulls on top of the orange homecoming 2009 coming up back a trip down to the corner and jimmy s corner he s with great policy welcome to our big east network halftime report inside the carrier dome in syracuse the bulls and orange are halfway through their big east openers so we head down to concetta s corner this week john sat down with<person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">greg paulus</person>who s defying all the odds jumping from point guard at duke to quarterback right here with the cue for the second installment of king james corner were glad to be in syracuse new york and with syracuse quarterback <person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">greg</person> paul <person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">greg</person> thanks for being on congeries corner today thanks for having me i got to ask you starting off it just a whirlwind experience for you coming back to where it all started for you in high school after a terrific college career at duke playing basketball for a legendary coach how does it feel now to come back and syracuse and play quarterback it s exciting at a lot of different levels to play football again to be able to get a masters at newhouse to be able to come home in a place where i grew up watching the diamond hats tomorrow harrison s light creamy so to be a part of syracuse again and put on the syracuse university uniform it s a pretty unique and special feeling when you were done playing basketball duke what made you realize that hey ive got another year of eligibility if i play another sport because you always have that in the back of your mind that you know there might be a chance i could play somewhere for one year someone mentioned it to me at some point i believe towards the later stages of the basketball season and i blew them off it s not i want to hear about basketball first you know at the end of the season ill look at all the options no matter what that might be and so you know i got a couple calls showing some interest about this fifth year possible workouts and i think that kind of got me thinking a little bit about it so i called my brother told me all about this he s a quarterback at unc and we started throwing the <person player="torrey ball" race="UNK" position="DL">ball</person> around i started to get that itch again that field the <person player="aj love" race="UNK" position="WR">love</person> of the game and i really missed it hitting the big three in basketball i mean that s got to be a thrill in front of a packed house cameron indoor arena how does it feel to throw your first collegiate touchdown in the carrier dome or when that happened how does it feel i was really excited and then we were down at the time so they get that touchdown and to kind of get that one push aside and kind of move over a little bit towards what s going to happen it was really exciting and i think that as time s going on hopefully we can get a few more in there did you practice that dance i i dont even know what i did but i thought it was good it s just a lot of fun out there im having a blast putting on the football uniform being around these guys playing for syracuse being a part of coach maroney coach defenses system and hopefully we can build this and put it in the right direction so you know without me being around here we can you know keep elevating and taking this program to you know where it used to be not taking anything away from anybody that you competed against in the summertime did you know in your heart it just was going to be your job no i had the confidence of my ability what i can do and all the things that i can help a team with i knew that coming to syracuse there was a few quarterbacks here coach morrell said these are the guys we got a year and have to win it and the best guy is going to get it but you know i knew that going into the situation and i worked as hard as i could as far as learning the offense getting the habits back and throwing again every day after not doing it for four or five years and i really just had to shorten the learning curve to the best of my ability and you know things have kind of fallen into place and i got to keep getting better and better to get to where i want to be im not there yet well i was a big fan of you when your reigning three im a big fan of you now wearing the orange playing quarterback thanks for coming on congenic scorner and the bestloved tomorrow thanks for having me you got it and obviously his teammates are big fans of his as we talked about in the first half i dont know what s more impressive the 68% completion or the fact that his teammates named him captain well i know his first year head coach <person player="doug hogue" race="UNK" position="LB">doug</person> morones a big fan because you get instant leadership instant credibility he s just a playmaker and he s a captain he s a leader of that team and everybody rises to the occasion as he goes this team s going to go well as paulists mentioned he s working

halftime report were inside the carrier dome a very interesting 30 minutes 14 to 13 the bulls undefeated at 4:00 no on top of syracuse if trying to climb over the 500 mark for the first time since 2006 the o clock on the wall says it s time to check out our big east breakdown in <person player="lonnie johnson" race="UNK" position="DB">johnson</person> tummy now takes us through some of that new syracuse offense play action in misdirection for syracuse is a very important part of their office and they will have to use this to slow down necks out portable front 7 you can see the play action inside and then they end around to the short side of the field this is very effective to keep george salvi paying attention and staying at home again the playaction pass which <person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">greg</person> pulse is very effective in using will slow down this front seven and allow<person player="mike williams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike williams</person>their big playmaker to get behind and secondary for six points and big plays youre going to see it again great playaction fake by <person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">paulus</person> will allow inside and then outside freezing that secondary about 10 to 12 yards off the line of scrimmage with their eyes in the backfield that allows<person player="mike williams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike williams</person>to get deep into that secondary and makes big plays for the orange now on the outside youre going to see a bubble screen take place as well well pulse will be in shotgun formation he will go ahead and pump to the outside again allowing that defense to bite and get behind the secondary very important watch the eyes of the quarterback he s watching paul the entire way on the bubble screen fake he takes the bait just like they want to<person player="mike williams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike williams</person>eludes that pressure gets behind the secondary and is in the end zone for six points carrying out that fake is so important ism well they did a great job of that the first half allowing that fake to take place get those secondary eyes in the backfield and then throw it over the top and they did a terrific job of finding the pump fake their to the outside that gets the safety over the top and that allows<person player="mike williams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike williams</person>to go up a make a play on the football and it was touchdown syracuse nice protection that time for<person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">greg paulus</person>couple of picks but he got that touchdown he s got syracuse within one of us steps well take a look at the highlights and the stats for the first half here from the carrier dome so the big each network game of the week continues right after this welcome back inside the carrier dome 1413 well check those numbers of the first half momentarily because they are ready to go as<person player="rob long" race="UNK" position="P">rob long</person>has heated up and he s ready to kick off of course usf won the toss they deferred they gave the <person player="torrey ball" race="UNK" position="DL">ball</person> up and now they will get the <person player="torrey ball" race="UNK" position="DL">ball</person> to open up the second half dante via <person player="dontavia bogan" race="UNK" position="WR">bogan</person> hell wolfson the defense and the second half is underway if they low but <person player="rob long" race="UNK" position="P">long</person> kick down at the goal line is <person player="dontavia bogan" race="UNK" position="WR">bogan</person> <person player="dontavia bogan" race="UNK" position="WR">bogan</person> looking for that wedge in the middle of the field and he s crept off at the 15 coming up to make this stop there is robert nieves or the orange let s look at the numbers on for the first 30 minutes done well the numbers were glaring when it comes to turnovers but i thought both teams really tried to settle down especially syracuse closer to the half five turnovers in the first four minutes and 10 seconds really was the story but total yard syracuse over 200 to 205 and then first down 12 first down so theyve done a nice job offensively now they have to set the tone that the offense carried into halftime bring it to defense and try to go three plays an out in their first series here we go first play second half bulls averaging about 39 points to game 14 on the board holding on to the onepoint lead<person player="bj daniels" race="UNK" position="QB">bj daniels</person>plenty of time going deep <person player="carlton mitchell" race="UNK" position="WR">mitchell</person> has at the 50 40 30 20 he is gone in the house first place i can have touchdown bull wow somebody just put the air out of the carrier dome we talked about an 85 yards<person player="bj daniels" race="UNK" position="QB">bj daniels</person>throws a strike right in front of the syracuse bench their big playmaker<person player="carlton mitchell" race="UNK" position="WR">carlton mitchell</person>just a huge play coming out of halftime we talked about the momentum changing and shifting gears from the bulls to the orange well it s right back on the green and gold right now he eludes the last wouldbe tackler and nikko scott and goes the distance for six points <person player="eric schwartz" race="UNK" position="K">schwartz</person> shawn with the kick is up it s good and <person player="carlton mitchell" race="UNK" position="WR">mitchell</person> now with four catches a hundred and twenty six yards and a couple of touchdowns as he continues to climb the alltime usf look i talked about an accurate throw playaction nice protection on the first play the third quarter and this <person player="jerrell young" race="UNK" position="DB">young</person> redshirt freshman just lets it rip down the right sideline got was the last person around the 30yard line that could make a play for the orange it s just a great job of playaction pass youre going to watch the safety in the backfield and the defensive backfield watch the playaction and let s see what happens when the playaction happened he goes to the inside and then goes back to cover on the underneath route and just a terrific job of being accurate with the throw by<person player="bj daniels" race="UNK" position="QB">bj daniels</person>he s a <person player="jerrell young" race="UNK" position="DB">young</person> quarterback but he made those plays last week on the road in his first start at florida state he comes back in the third quarter and sets the tone for the bulls offense really jumps out as the poise with a capital p some people said and they included a couple of big plays against the seminoles <person player="rob long" race="UNK" position="P">long</person> passes break down in the seminole secondary but ill tell you this superman has a lot of poise to step up there the way he did when<person player="carlton mitchell" race="UNK" position="WR">carlton mitchell</person>as well we talked about him being one of those impact players at the beginning of the game he makes big plays in bunches those inside the 5yard line breaks to the outside you see some green estefan gets up to the 35 what was the 35 yard line for<person player="mike jones" race="UNK" position="RB">mike jones</person>we turned him 33 we took a look at the suit quarterback <person player="bj daniels" race="UNK" position="QB">bj</person> kendall <person player="bj daniels" race="UNK" position="QB">daniels</person> and <person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">greg</person> paul looks a lot better for bk daniel s after one play of the third quarter 7 of 204 161 yards two touchdowns now and he hasnt turned it over which is a good thing<person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">greg paulus</person>has two turnovers but 12:22 for 163 and it s four to go into halftime so let s see where they can pick up offensively now the orange remember mike they had a good mix of run and pass in that first half the lone carter had 30 yards rushing the football<person player="antwon bailey" race="UNK" position="RB">antwon bailey</person>kicked in for 13 so they did a good job rushing the football play action the carter follows right spyer s sannansan completes its coverage on the play by drill <person player="jerome murphy" race="UNK" position="DB">murphy</person> that time normally the strong take actually playing corner because so tracy s shuffled that defensive secondary this week as a couple guys playing different positions due to injury but the one constant is <person player="jerome murphy" race="UNK" position="DB">murphy</person> being back there he s one of the game changers on the corner on the edge for this bull defense and of course<person player="nate allen" race="nonwhite" position="DB">nate allen</person>free safety with a big int earlier in the first half follows two picks and a touchdown here there s lemon<person player="alec lemon" race="UNK" position="WR">alec lemon</person>and a good pursuit so once again by the defense coming up to a make the stop is a<person player="kayvon webster" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kayvon webster</person>a true freshman employed well the adjustment it looks like the florida state or excuse me south florida has made in the second half is joe tracy their defensive coordinator really pressing the issue when the orange is trying to go outside for their screenplay trying to get up and attack those receivers not give them a lot of room or a lot of time for those offensive linemen to get downfield <person player="antwon bailey" race="UNK" position="RB">bailey</person> and carter in the backfield now for syracuse out of the gun as follows on a third and ten aachen stateimpact one up over the 50 yard line<person player="mike williams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike williams</person>117 first half yards gaines 15 more you know john coming in he had a as far as career receptions houston gaining on scotch suede he s with 139 812 nopales doing a nice job of stepping up and staying in that pocket today s first and ten line is brought to you by overstockcom paul is doing a nice job of anticipating where his big play receiver<person player="mike williams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike williams</person>would be on that in route and williams went up and took the football away williams down eight catches for 133 eight gives him 120 s this 19 shy of the school record not a hit the left side alive there s pee on wilson number 42 getting another tackle along with some of that defensive front but you know what barone was saying earlier this week he said you know or he told us he hit himself he left the defensive ends tell him that he s in a good job of staying away from this guy derek is trying to get to the line of scrimmage and get an advantage you can see the dejection on the sidelines of <person player="doug hogue" race="UNK" position="LB">doug</person> marrone he wanted to snap that football right away looked like the bulls were confused defensively second and nine from the gun hollis that was a run from the getgo gets back to the line of scrimmage some of the bull showing read and defense looks good on stairs and quinn mike it s amazing the difference one play can have on the momentum of a building and the energy in a building it was great seen here at halftime homecoming crowd today class the 1959 national championship undefeated team honored at halftime everybody in good spirits a certain buzz in this building and then one play later<person player="bj daniels" race="UNK" position="QB">bj daniels</person>carlton metro and all of a sudden the building is you know kind of back to that flatness that s been here for the last three or four years well quint well see if they can get something going now as far as electricity four of eight it s just an bad 50% considering theyre 20% out of the year from thursday <person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">paulus</person> biasing time and he s got the first down well i didnt look like a guy that s been out of football for four years that s not well that was impressive because the play before looked like <person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">greg</person> paul got up a little bit slower from the big hit he took at the end of the play but on third down instinctively he does step up into the pocket and he sees hey nobody here im going to tuck it and run i can get this first down and he has a nice job of trying to get underneath that last hit just intangibles do you have to had that clock in your head as a quarterback he felt like he needed to tuck it and run and moves the change for the orange 11 minutes to go in the third quarter <person player="antwon bailey" race="UNK" position="RB">bailey</person> jones razzle dazzle all it just comes up and grille disrupted that play<person player="chris robinson" race="UNK" position="LB">chris robinson</person>find finally make the tackle but theyll look just a redshirt freshman from delray beach boy watch this john this guy can really hit against the bars presley last week against florida state watch him de cleat this <person player="jerrell young" race="UNK" position="DB">young</person> man yeah <person player="jerrell young" race="UNK" position="DB">young</person> man going one way football going another and that was the biggest one of the biggest hits early in this season i dont care what level would conference your plane and that was a deep leader knock out <person player="jim mckenzie" race="UNK" position="OL">jim</person> he is standing eight it s over with and presley thought he had some running room picked up five or six looking for more and logistic nowhere from that safety spot and if he laid the wood knocked up the <person player="torrey ball" race="UNK" position="DL">ball</person> and that s one of the turnovers that gave the bull some good field position last week <person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">paulus</person> comes up the loss of mark that time im looking for his old high school teammate of our <person player="lavar lobdell" race="UNK" position="WR">lobdell</person> who is off to a slow start just four catches this year for the fifth year senior and<person player="jerome murphy" race="UNK" position="DB">jerome murphy</person>helped pressure in the pocket that time by coming on the short side blitz when we you talked about john logistic just a freshman just a freight job of pressuring the pocket when they bring him on the blitz but he comes with authority from that secondary just as a terrific job for joe tracy and head coach <person player="jim mckenzie" race="UNK" position="OL">jim</person> leavitt by filling the void in that secondary and they can move him around in different spots very active with just only a redshirt freshman the <person player="mistral raymond" race="UNK" position="DB">raymond</person> the junior getting the start for the second time is loose bones complete again and<person player="nate allen" race="nonwhite" position="DB">nate allen</person>makes the stop before they pick up 11 more for the oil boy great job of coming back to the football they<person player="mike williams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike williams</person>you can see it from the quarterbacks point of view a little bit of pressure he settles himself again reset his feet and then comes back to the football through the hole there s<person player="mike williams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike williams</person>to attack the <person player="torrey ball" race="UNK" position="DL">ball</person> that s what all good receivers do i wouldnt be surprised if they try to go right back to them our numbers are staggering today 144 yards the rest of the team only had a hundred converted a third and 10 and 39 on this drive and some of the law still city that they used to talk about coming back inside the courier going up a lot of smiles just below the press box here the orange fans liking what theyre seeing with <person player="doug hogue" race="UNK" position="LB">doug</person> marrone so far well i think i think <person player="doug hogue" race="UNK" position="LB">doug</person> brings back the toughness of syracuse and i think he brought back a mentality that theyre going to play that his way in his way is the right way and it s oldschool but yet they do flashes of different things that it gives them on you know the screens the drawers the counters they do enough in their offense and they have they play tough tenacious defense inside nine minutes 20 1 to 13 the bulls leave the orange with the orange on the move <person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">paulus</person> fires should have been shot that time mike going through the first fight of that and so syracuse where s quinn mentioned that 1959 national championship team by led by ernie <person player="donte davis" race="UNK" position="WR">davis</person> and you look at well ten and seven and big east openers three league titles in 97 98 and 2004 and syracuse football by the numbers all 675 wins that s more wins than any other biggy school and 22 bowl appearances that s their something they would <person player="aj love" race="UNK" position="WR">love</person> to get back to this year oh looks and this one s the bucket its jack and thank the defensive cluster rubble on the play at the end of the play mike here keeps they have this back oh my gosh we shot seven turnovers in the first half now the bulls it looks like they have it im not sure policies dragging that right shoulder a little bit he was banged up he took a couple shots during that series of plays and that one was vicious<person player="kayvon webster" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kayvon webster</person>the true freshman from florida with the pick his first of the year paul is trying to settle himself trying to go to<person player="mike williams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike williams</person>again it wasnt so much the hit but the course on the arm that s a problem and that s where you have injuries in that rotator cuff we saw <person player="chad battles" race="UNK" position="DL">chad</person> pennington last week in the nfl have something a problem with his shoulder just like that the arm gets the big wingspan of pierre paul was able to get right in front of the throw of pollock five turnovers now john for syracuse <person player="doug hogue" race="UNK" position="LB">doug</person> marrone said they would have beat minnesota if they werent 1 for 12 on third down on that first game now five turnovers the interesting to see what happens here a little option play<person player="mike ford" race="UNK" position="RB">mike ford</person>averaged seven yards the pop in the first half he s inside the 30yard line before being knocked out loud boy great patience by <person player="bj daniels" race="UNK" position="QB">bj</person> daniel whew he eludes the first defensive end on the opposite play but then has the sense to keep relationship with the tailback and he still has relationship enough to pitch the football great job by the quarterback and also by<person player="mike ford" race="UNK" position="RB">mike ford</person>of not giving up on his quarterback in a fake play right after the turnover bobby j <person player="bj daniels" race="UNK" position="QB">daniels</person> opened up the second half first play of the second half 85 yard touchdown strike<person player="carlton mitchell" race="UNK" position="WR">carlton mitchell</person>now he has the bulls on the move after the 21 yard gain by mike for <person player="aj love" race="UNK" position="WR">aj</person> <person player="bj daniels" race="UNK" position="QB">daniels</person> left changes direction and he kind of stumbled forward a gain of a company let s go back downstairs with quintics mike syracuse is training staff looking at the right throwing elbow of<person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">greg paulus</person>deciding that was safe to let him throw he s standing up right now and taking some warmup throws so things appear to be to be okay for <person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">greg</person> pause ill keep your fingers crossed because as you mentioned the torque the torque and grabbing of the arm i can really abuk with that larry that s where you have problems there you see correct number on the afternoon three interceptions and he played better than that but reality is they turn the football over again and the bulls are driving second and 15 you say <person player="bj daniels" race="UNK" position="QB">daniels</person> looking for his tight end <person player="ben busbee" race="UNK" position="TE">ben</person> busby usually a been wearing the number 82 wearing that number 10 this afternoon keeley dorothy s door number 10 he was a star high school running back out of kalahasthi went to the bolt in january of 2007 during a morning workout he collapsed and died what was ruled a

his playmaker receiver on the outside<person player="carlton mitchell" race="UNK" position="WR">carlton mitchell</person>and a swing pass go to the short side <person player="bj daniels" race="UNK" position="QB">daniels</person> all you had to do was turn his head to the right the linebacker expands out to the weak side and the curl route wide open so a nice play by<person player="carlton mitchell" race="UNK" position="WR">carlton mitchell</person>moving the chains and a good accurate throw by daniel single running back mike board busby emotion is pulling hit immediately nice job coming up from the quarterbacks like kevin scott in him in the backfield but ford spun and got back to the line of scrimmage actually gained a yard on the play nice aggressive play called offensively by scott shafer bringing the short corner kevin scott in the short side of the field he s able to get into the backfield and eliminate a big play potential <person player="aj love" race="UNK" position="WR">aj</person> daniel when he was talking about what he learned from<person player="matt grothe" race="UNK" position="QB">matt grothe</person>one thing he learned the biggest thing some said it he runs out of real estate but he finds some more good job by the orange and again it was kevin scott coming up with a quarterback spot to make the initial contact but daniel said he learned a lot from growth you especially about taking command in the huddle all over you when you had total command of the other well i was nine because my father made me do it i was convinced first no you know what it all comes with time and it comes with being positive and it comes with you know making play you know the better you are the better the more confidence that your teammate avenue the more they quiet down to let you control the huddle opt out<person player="bj daniels" race="UNK" position="QB">bj daniels</person>find some greens got some wheels thought about it cuts back inside the five and he goes down so it s going to be really lola mike on this spot all he had to do is get to the five or inches beyond just another athletic play by<person player="bj daniels" race="UNK" position="QB">bj daniels</person>keeping those legs going we talked to mike canales the offensive coordinator talking about how confident he is how athletic just just makes plays with his legs youve got to set the strong arm and it s hang off right now but it may be just a football short of that first down it looks like the bulls make quick snaps it and get up to the line of scrimmage and try to push ahead for this fourth fourth down try perfect three for three on the year fourth down get into the big backcourt he s got the first down and the touchdown so mike board with 12 touchdowns rushing as a freshman picks up his second here this afternoon good northsouth running by the junior out of sarasota florida mike board goes in for a tough run good job at the point of attack by the orange but just outmatched you get mac souter at 511 190 coming up from that strong safety spot taking on a guy that 6 to 225 most of the time mike boards going to win that battle 6 to 225 im not sure what he played out as a freshman but he seems thicker nice he s bigger and swartz there he meant visit this time but the bulls go eight blades 48 yards in four and a half minutes right now they open up the scoreboard well breathing thanks to number 26<person player="mike ford" race="UNK" position="RB">mike ford</person>and he has his third touchdown this fall 27 to 13 volts on top welcome back inside the carrier dome the biggest network game of the week presented by dnc 27 to 13 right now the orange fans watching the bull score one more guts down they missed the extra point four minutes and seven seconds to go you know <person player="jonathan meldrum" race="UNK" position="OL">jonathan</person> jimmy writes a column every week on the espn boss website and i believe you said it was 31 the 13th final four that s what i was thinking you know coming into the game but hopefully the oranges with 407 left to go in the third quarter can prove me wrong with the bulls of scored 20 of their 27 points they off of 5c reduce turnover so that leads through this 27 to 13 lead and you know the polls arent innocent on their turnover part anyway theyve had three turnovers themselves so theyre keeping the orange in this game as well 407 to go in the third quarter<person player="eric schwartz" race="UNK" position="K">eric schwartz</person>with the kick it goes to jones again inside the 10 going up over the 20 penalty flag drops and 116 one coming at about the 32 so two flags down on the field return of 14 for<person player="mike jones" race="UNK" position="RB">mike jones</person>illegal block in the back the p8 in the return team pass addition to the goal hurt that so the infraction who pushes it back for the orange were going to take another quick timeout with four minutes and one second to go

december 9th and 10th in both new york and tampa and by liberty mutual insurance responsibility what s your policy yeah were looking at the carousel mall the carousel shopping center here in syracuse

the first half and now coming out a couple turnovers put the pulls up 27 13 and now the orange pin back inside their own 10yard line a lot of green lot of ground to make up trailing 27 to 13 <person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">paulus</person> comes up williams picks up the 9 on the reception the wyndham continues to all pile up the numbers and remember mike <person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">paulus</person> was a bit dinged up in that last series with that shoulder or elbow problem that quint brought to us from the sideline so he comes out throwing on first down and it looked pretty good on first down with the velocity then catches now 153 yards for williams dimension in career receptions he had a hundred 12 coming in the school record scotch wade he holds at 139 right up the middle trying to move the foul and with the change orders originates and 23 seconds to go look at that full defense in the speed they have at the new defensive coordinator joe tracy used to be at cincinnati youd mentioned he you tackle at 80 85 percent you get three turnovers you have a good chance to win they were 81 at cincinnati when they did that yeah they really do and they want to play pressure defense they want to force the issue at the line of scrimmage theyve got those big four down linemen that can put pressure on you and sergey s has done a good job trying to contain those guys but that defensive speed you just cant coach that vollis felt the pressure checked off take 10 pierre paul the big east defensive player of the week as his first college touchdown sacré forced fumble free tackle for loss against florida state but that memory will linger a <person player="rob long" race="UNK" position="P">long</person> time a pick six well you talked about pressuring the pocket that s exactly what this bulls team did on the screen play it was just a little screen but great athleticism by the junior<person player="jason pierrepaul" race="UNK" position="DL">jason pierrepaul</person>just as excellent job of staying on the line of scrimmage scraping down the line of scrimmage and then getting that gift wrapped right to him for the interception for a touchdown this guy s a student of the game and it s very important to him studying all the time in the classroom watching film you know he only can be screened so many times before you read one and you take it the other way<person player="eric schwartz" race="UNK" position="K">eric schwartz</person>a good this time on the point after were going to take another timeout<person player="jason pierrepaul" race="UNK" position="DL">jason pierrepaul</person>ten and a half sacks last year at junior college allamerican now he has his first touchdown on a fort scott community college in kansas back at the carrier dome with more after this 34:13 now the bulls looks like theyre getting closer to going five and oh right now john let s take a look at our good hands play of the day brought to you by allstate boy nice read by<person player="jason pierrepaul" race="UNK" position="DL">jason pierrepaul</person>he s just going to scrape along the line of scrimmage he feels like he s not getting blocks like dr vaughn back so he hangs and slides down the line of scrimmage right in front of<person player="antwon bailey" race="UNK" position="RB">antwon bailey</person>who was waiting for the screen pass and that s the allstate good hands play of a play of the day the interception for a touchdown by the big fella decent <person player="jason pierrepaul" race="UNK" position="DL">pierrepaul</person> offers from florida florida state miami nebraska oklahoma and he winds up at usf because his job is to take the pressure off george shelby and if you can do that no pressure now six turnovers have led to 27 points for the bulls here this afternoon 252 to go on the third quarter 34 13 jones again at the vibe john finds it seems diesel takes it over the third and 35 drop at the 36 let s go back downstairs 20 mike <person player="jason pierrepaul" race="UNK" position="DL">pierrepaul</person> took a nontraditional path south florida the son of haitian immigrants as a youngster he broke his leg three times there s some hesitation a play football this is play high school football is your new year humanity kicked around went to to junior colleges rolled in south florida after 18 credits of summer school this year started practicing at camp two weeks late he clearly is one of the brightening stars in the big east that s a great point went so he s just coming into his own missing a two weeks of camp yeah he s only going to get better and probably a little bit bigger six six 265 and he can do a backflip in full gear and that youll see it on the field but that s tough for ya draw play at the carter and carter is the buckle down gone by williams the backup linebacker what a good tackle is bates by williams the junior out of miami who did an excellent job of corralling the loan carter there was a couple ways he could go he s decided to go outside it carter and i could open field tackle by williams all the seven the gun 16 of 31 for 198 yards for paulists one touchdown for fix now goes right back to work dante <person player="donte davis" race="UNK" position="WR">davis</person> up over the 40 im going to stop button <person player="quenton washington" race="UNK" position="DB">washington</person> top floor penalty play mike they may call that horse collar play because he went backwards in a hurry i know he was hit but it looked like one of the defenders may have reached in to the inside of those shoulder pads and brought him back towards rivet 42 face that 15yard penalty first down let s be on wilson senior from jacksonville declare though he said he wants to average about ten tackles a game and pick up where tyrone mackenzie left off last year well the good thing about <person player="kion wilson" race="UNK" position="LB">kion</person> is the guy loves to practice and he loves to play and that s the one thing that joe tracy their defensive coordinator said that you cant get this guy out of the pill room and off the practice field that s why he s always around the football a great story how his family moved to here s carter not too much running room get back to the line of scrimmage and nowhere to go it s a wall a wall a bull something you dont want to run into as a wall full take number 95 george selden 203 tackles coming into the game 64 and a half backwards for la 27 a half sack pretty good numbers is outstanding and really he s been silent today i thought the syracuse knicks feller that tackled a sophomore tackle out of baltimore has done a nice job on george playaction here comes the pressure nice job of eluding the rush and this one s picked off wow<person player="nate allen" race="nonwhite" position="DB">nate allen</person>gets another inp hump john earlier in the broadcast were talking about <person player="nate allen" race="nonwhite" position="DB">allen</person> that s the singing to sleep here but oh seven we turned an int 37 yards and int returned a fumble against west virginia against auburn he had an int forced fumble recovered a fumble last year against kansas he had that pick for 41 seconds to go to set up the game one of the skies mr cluck when <person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">paulus</person> did an excellent job of eluding the pressure the first pressure and then he gets hit by keyon wilson but just a better break on the football by<person player="nate allen" race="nonwhite" position="DB">nate allen</person>then he wrestled the football away from <person player="marcus sales" race="UNK" position="WR">marcus</person> alice on the bottom of that pile so good job by<person player="nate allen" race="nonwhite" position="DB">nate allen</person>and just two turnovers you cant you cant win with half of those turnovers let alone having four in the first half and three in the second to seven total that s a recipe for a lot it s hard to win at any level with seven turnovers i mean west virginia found that out against auburn when they turned it over six times there s log with the end around and he picked up the first down and he s bounced out of bounds by number six at they moan murchison celebrating its goodyear sponsoring the good hands here though that allstate make contributions to participating university general scholarship funds for each field goal an extra point penn state allstate has contributed more than 18 million dollars in scholarship money good hands people winding down here in the third quarter<person player="bj daniels" race="UNK" position="QB">bj daniels</person>playaction plenty of time second quick feet we had plenty of time but very quickly was irrelevant the middle linebacker and he still avoided him he s a slashing type of runner and he can turn it on and turn it off in an infant it looks like it s the top speed within a couple steps and that s the one thing you really dont anticipate as a defensive lineman or a defensive end or a linebacker is how elusive and how quick<person player="bj daniels" race="UNK" position="QB">bj daniels</person>first and second step really is one thing we really have another chance maybe it s a credit to syracuse of defense so we havent really had a chance to seem cut on a dime like you did against florida state i think you really got florida state off you our last week well 45 minutes in the books 15 minutes to go here on homecoming 2009 34 for the bowl 13 for syracuse the final 15 minutes coming up to the dome right today as we take a look at clinton square in syracuse new york bobby gray skies here in syracuse it was sunny blue skies are earlier today and right now those clouds have kind of hovered over the field inside the carrier dome the orange moving the <person player="torrey ball" race="UNK" position="DL">ball</person> down 1413 that all of a sudden some bad things happened seven turnovers now five ints john yeah the most since 1982 against penn state and they come in bunches and to start the game he cant read the football on the carpet alone carter was the guy that started all the miscues and a couple interceptions and then a return on the edge you get another fumble then you break off of a route another interception is we get hit from behind and when you stop your throwing motion and a gift goes to<person player="nate allen" race="nonwhite" position="DB">nate allen</person>and then the biggest gift of all was on the screenplay where<person player="jason pierrepaul" race="UNK" position="DL">jason pierrepaul</person>was just sitting there waiting for it and then another interception by<person player="nate allen" race="nonwhite" position="DB">nate allen</person>out of that secondary theyve done an excellent job of really forcing turnovers have the bulls but theyre at youth played so well early in this football game and missed you they were only down a point going to halftime 1413 and you saw the five interceptions most since 82 todd norley was the <person player="jerrell young" race="UNK" position="DB">young</person> man playing quarterback that day that had the <person player="rob long" race="UNK" position="P">long</person> afternoon first play of the fourth quarter coming up here for<person player="bj daniels" race="UNK" position="QB">bj daniels</person>he opened up the second half with an 85yard touchdown fires hit <person player="carlton mitchell" race="UNK" position="WR">mitchell</person> cutter stepped aside about shy of the 40 yard line and jeonyul it involved and <person player="carlton mitchell" race="UNK" position="WR">mitchell</person> coming in he was only 343 yards of climbing to the top of the ladder which everybody thought jessie hester would do this year but hester has yet to play be the answer is that foot injury and hamstring injuries really hampered jesse hunter hasnt even been out to play in a game this year as you said mike so the big play guys fault <person player="carlton mitchell" race="UNK" position="WR">mitchell</person> and boys he filled in nicely third and two daniel whooping on top and overshoots his man that s number 11<person player="aj love" race="UNK" position="WR">aj love</person>for his first touchdown in 2009 getting back to you a<person player="carlton mitchell" race="UNK" position="WR">carlton mitchell</person>yeah yeah 130 yards against western kentucky that s when he s jumping over yes because through oars to watch from the sidelines and the hesperides make the trip no you know we felt like in talking with the coaching staff during the week that he may have a chance to play but you know couldnt make it do that foot in hamstring and rien on third and short the bull try to tack on two more points to that 34 point total but overshoot <person player="aj love" race="UNK" position="WR">love</person> down the middle <person player="delbert alvarado" race="UNK" position="K">alvarado</person> with another short field to do it with dante <person player="donte davis" race="UNK" position="WR">davis</person> with the third guess about the 13 yard line 28 yard funky we take a look at one of our flashbacks and number nine don macpherson quarterback heisman trophy runnerup led the syracuse at 87 undefeated season and don macpherson singleseason 213 yards passing now back in 1987 let s go downstairs with twitter standing by with the the former quarterback yes that s right he s here former current college hall of famer back for homecoming you walk in the dome today well what what s the biggest stone memory you have as a player you know the player probably with the penn state win the nine three seven and theyre going to west virginia winning in the atmosphere he s going was probably the biggest thing i remember as an alum what was your reaction when <person player="doug hogue" race="UNK" position="LB">doug</person> marrone was hired i was thrilled i thought it was important that we have a north east guy was important that we have sold over programs i fall <person player="doug hogue" race="UNK" position="LB">doug</person> s career and rita georgia tech at georgia and then in the nfl and i was thrilled that he came back and i think he s the right guy for the job what s the most important thing for him right now in terms of improving the program you know i think he s done really build a great staff you got a foothold back in recruiting in the northeast and he s taking his time with this program building it bringing back to the bring back position something that players can hold on to i think youve done those things already he backed himself into a pretty good quarterback although gregg falls has turned the <person player="torrey ball" race="UNK" position="DL">ball</person> over today what s the biggest challenge for gregg paul s coming straight from the basketball fort to the football field well i think the biggest challenge just getting ranked were getting used to the physical maitre of the football game you know he definitely crowds managing the game managing the court and as a quarterback not much different but you know investable no one s gonna punch in the mouth and that s that s what you have to deal with he s been punched in the mouth today a bit what would a word of advice think he s good enough and that s the beauty of this game is that if you keep getting up you can prove that you can play physically you can do it all unfortunately dont have patience because it doesnt have a lot of time but there are some growing things that that weve seen really experienced in <person player="jerrell young" race="UNK" position="DB">young</person> what about im great seeing you you look great syracuse quarterback from the late eighties don macpherson second in the heisman voting back in 87 thanks gwen to don macpherson to his credit when asked when everybody all the naysayers about paula s saying you cant do it he said exactly that he said well when youre a point guard you dont have to worry about getting punched in the mouth youre gonna get punched in the mouth but you know what his natural talent will win out and look at the jobs out here and he s done that today he s actually been coming back and keep coming back after big hits and he had the shoulder hit you know on the interception he was hit a couple times by the sidelines and you keep seeing number two come out to play quarterback and that s a good sign and that s the maturity level and it s a toughest thing that you have to overcome at that position keep in mind number two get into the game averaging 222 yards passing that s number two singleseason here at syracuse marvin graves past for 231 a game back in 93 as far as any punches mom you know polish will get up play another out of bed we talked about all those intangibles yesterday and had a nice conversation with him that everybody thought halftime and he has that toughness he has that mathy he has that demeanor from going from the basketball fort and bringing that to the quarterback position and he s on a rapid pace and in a fast learning curve but he s getting it done three years starter at duke for mike souschefs key i lost the starting jobs in nolan smith last year and certainly didnt sit around and pout about it really really a good team player throws it out of bounds this time looking for a <person player="cody catalina" race="UNK" position="TE">catalina</person> but how about on the brighter side how about williams im like glen s 11 catches 158 yards a touchdown today well aim has been filled with a lot of turnovers and seven of those on the orange side williams has had a terrific day 11 receptions for 158 and a touchdown and he s been the playmaker on the outside everybody was waiting to see today 1210 to go in the ballgame 34 to 13 syracuse down with the <person player="torrey ball" race="UNK" position="DL">ball</person> trying to get something going theyll have west virginia coming in here next week and the bulls if they get out of here which looks like they will have that big big thursday night game with cincinnati coming up alright john let s take a look not our biggest leaders brought to you by pnc leading the way jarrod brown there you see the big east totals entering this week 335 yards they dropped maybe a little bit after thursday but tony pike right there and how about tony pike s a lot of people are starting to mention tony pike and in the same sentence so you know that s one of those things at cincinnati they can keep it rolling and the bulls look like theyre going to win out here today and big matchup next week as noel devine keeps piling up 220 theyre going to pitch yeah well and theyre swinging out into the flat that s another first down<person player="antwon bailey" race="UNK" position="RB">antwon bailey</person>both in another brawl a soft <person player="jeremiah warren" race="UNK" position="OL">warren</person> patients gear paul through the arms on that gun man on the letter he knocked down so much traffic at the bottom scrimmage i like the pace that that derrick use is running their offense and i like was with <person player="doug hogue" race="UNK" position="LB">doug</person> marrone the head coach is really brought to this university brought back you know he was a player here a former offensive lineman and he s brought back that mentality and brought back that toughness on on both sides of the football bhalla steps up and he takes the hit at the midfield strike deliver all the blow that am <person player="sam barrington" race="nonwhite"

position="DL">ball</person> carrier <person player="antwon bailey" race="UNK" position="RB">bailey</person> let s see if we can pick it up to the right side of our screen youll see three and <person player="josh white" race="UNK" position="OL">white</person> come down and just nail that that head right now leading with the head wasnt helmet to helmet contact but the intent was there i think that

touchdown i had a unique vantage point i was in the end zone actually on the hash i felt like i was playing safety for south florida that <person player="torrey ball" race="UNK" position="DL">ball</person> put in the air<person player="mike williams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike williams</person>there s no such thing as a 50/50 <person player="torrey ball" race="UNK"

that one williams 187 yard the rest of the team 149 here research well mike that the part of the game where the bolton s have to be careful there s nine minutes and 52 seconds left to go the orange only down choose touchdown they have to come out and put a drive together i mean that s a catchable <person player="torrey ball" race="UNK" position="DL">ball</person> on the outside and you have to come down with that if youre<person player="aj love" race="UNK" position="WR">aj love</person>it just puts you behind the chain on second down instead of having a positive first down play as two years the bulls crack in the top ten climbing the number few three years fell and in the collapse so they think thing about that is that past history you know i think that s somewhere in the back of their mind not today but it s somewhere in their mind in very patient active looking it covers that down by syracuse and no one s open for daniel s will keep it himself and he s dropped at about the 21 lots of three on the play remember this is all best at play for negative three yards was all set up by a drop pass on first down so now instead of being in a positive second down situation or maybe even having a first e10 now theyre at a third and 13 and that s gotta cost anguish and a lot of upset stomachs on the south florida sidewalk three of eight on third down and make it four of nine as number 81 dante via <person player="dontavia bogan" race="UNK" position="WR">bogan</person> the junior from thomasville georgia fix up 19 again vj <person player="bj daniels" race="UNK"

player="mike ford" race="UNK" position="RB">mike ford</person>yeah theyve narrowed it down to two and i like the one thing that they said about her he said about hardedged mentality they went oneonone

there s that explosive speed you talked about i mean you look towards the middle of the field and spam he was gone 8 of 24 on the plane for<person player="bj daniels" race="UNK" position="QB">bj daniels</person>we talked about it mike he gets to his top speed about his second or third step and that normally happens if youre a running back not at the quarterback position<person player="bj daniels" race="UNK" position="QB">bj daniels</person>is electrifying he he just has that first about him and he s a slashing type of runner 40 yards today close to closing in on 200 yards passing so

race="UNK" position="DL">ball</person> they really do and they account for everything they communicate well at the linebacker position they set everybody up in front of them and behind them so they theyre doing it theyre doing a great job for scott qi for the new defensive coordinator here and theyre playing at a high level and moving to the football board nice job of waiting for an

position="QB">bj</person> daniel stepped up into the pocket now another big third down situation for the bull who are they going to go to is it s a running style of vijay <person player="bj daniels" race="UNK" position="QB">daniels</person> or is he going to get it outside through his big play receiver<person player="carlton mitchell" race="UNK" position="WR">carlton mitchell</person>swings it up to four to the flat since i whoa still on his feet at the 30yard line had to get down to the 25 first down mack suitors coming over from strom safeties box magnificat back tutor weve got ten tackles

position="LB">doug</person> marrone defense on third down just a combination route with <person player="carlton mitchell" race="UNK" position="WR">mitchell</person> going down and running the curl route and poured out in a flat that time syracuse makes the proper adjustment and coach barone talking on the sideline to see what the bulls are going to do probably going to maybe take a timeout as this clock winds down closer to the fiveminute mark syracuse scoring thirtyseven and fortyone the last two weeks first time they scored 35 and backtoback games from so four but as you mentioned the bulls start to eat claw south florida first bull suits up their first time out of the second half here leaving them with two and syracuse with three five minutes and three seconds to go on the <person

line doing a great job but just setting that wall up allowing<person player="bj daniels" race="UNK" position="QB">bj daniels</person>just a slide to his right slide back to his left and give time for his receivers to find the open area in that secondary youre talking about eating clock where they ate a lot of time plus picked up the first down four hits the right side he s got some running room and first touchdown 126 yards back to the first quarter of the yard that time he s got a couple of touchdowns today two of the 12 of the 34 points in should say were all smith stopping in court now 12

holmes</person>has come from that secondary well with darrell smith ralph smith playing an excellent game is that middle linebacker spot but just a little bit not enough in this game defensively to come over those seven turnovers to really come back and win the battle to field position because of those turnovers have given south florida extra life third down there four of ten 40% diamond season 49% coming in for in the backfield with daniel makes the snap and just takes off and youll find from the getgo and a number 99 that shandler jones the younger brother of<person player="arthur jones"

johnson" race="UNK" position="DB">johnson</person> geminians predicted that during the commercial break what was it that you didnt think hed make well i dont recall the kicking stats right off top of my head but they werent good going into the game alright let s take a look at our liberty mutual play of the game it was the big pass play <person player="bj daniels" race="UNK" position="QB">bj</person> daniel s doing a great job of coming back back up in his own end playaction just stepped up in the pocket delivers it broke down the right side altough <person player="carlton mitchell" race="UNK" position="WR">mitchell</person> had to do was corral it keep his feet elude one tackler around the 30yard line right there and then dont tap down the sideline for the score huge play in our liberty usual play of the game first play from scrimmage to open up the second half it was 85 yards for the score hollis comes over the middle looking for <person player="cody catalina" race="UNK" position="TE">catalina</person> and <person player="cody catalina" race="UNK" position="TE">catalina</person> number that time by the linebacker<person player="chris

and that s because they for seven let me say that again they for seven turnovers and theyve outscored syracuse 20 to nothing in the third quarter as you mentioned mike the big play the play of the game coming right out of the gate to start the third quarter whether landis football game started im not sure if many people were forcing turnovers in that first quarter the <person player="torrey ball" race="UNK" position="DL">ball</person> just seemed like it was greased or something nobody yeah either side i believe south florida had at least two or three right out of the gate as well and it just kept going back and forth yeah the first play of the bulls offensively today was a bad exchange between quarterback and center that s like hey we dont want the <person player="torrey ball" race="UNK" position="DL">ball</person> you take it well just stop you on defense to 2219 clock is running 34 20 now paulo s trying to get some more points on the board markus sailes complete first and was out of bounds over the 35 in a 121 thing that did come true that head coach <person player="doug hogue" race="UNK" position="LB">doug</person> marrone was telling us yesterday he was not going to let george salvi and pierre feel of <person player="jason pierrepaul" race="UNK" position="DL">pierrepaul</person> win the game for them now pierre paul had an interception on that on that screenplay but other than that play theyve really done a nice job of containing those guys they screened him outside they ran draw plays they ran playaction they did a lot of good things they just didnt protect the football enough that s a great point to bring up that s when it s knocked down by the freshman linebacker<person player="sam barrington" race="nonwhite" position="LB">sam barrington</person>i was going to say a syracuse fans may or may not want to hear you take away the the inp turnovers in the game plan was a super game plan that syracuse coming with yeah they did they executed well you know other than the miscues early in the game they laid it laying the football on the carpet second and 10 through <person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">paulus</person> looks right comes back left to<person player="mike williams" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike williams</person>lose the half a yard or yard on the play quarterback sketball fans said join your tune and historic charles their second title of south carolina to watch the bulls compete in the charleston classic that s november 19th through the 22nd the tickets and travel the charleston classic calm inside the carrier dome in syracuse another time on call with a minute 43 to go yeah that s one guy right there that joe tracy the defensive coordinator for the bulls does not want to lose shawn lee gifts doing a great job last week in the historic win over florida state on the road in tallahassee and today doing an excellent job coming up from that strong safety position that s secondary and he can hit you he sure can only a redshirt freshman hello safety over there is mr al <person player="mistral raymond" race="UNK" position="DB">raymond</person> a junior is really number 16 he s done a great job the one of the coaches last year on the staff said that there s no way he would even get on the field here he is starting for these guys he had a different guy evaluating number 16 mr <person player="mistral raymond" race="UNK" position="DB">raymond</person> he goes by the name of skinny troy douglas who moved on to another staff now was asked of <person player="mistral raymond" race="UNK" position="DB">raymond</person> i would get on the field he said if he s in the game there s a sweet bay supermarket im gonna go down and get some chips and a diet mountain dew go home and watch some other games on tv because if <person player="mistral raymond" race="UNK" position="DB">raymond</person> gets into the game this game is over so now he likes to remind everybody that he nicknamed himself sweet bay his areas starting for a pretty good defensive team always somebody start calling me get well if nobody in the family you even do it <person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">paulus</person> go down there s the sack and this one s credited to number 94<person player="craig marshall" race="UNK" position="DL">craig marshall</person>that s the third today for the bulls giving them 13 and it s <person player="craig marshall" race="UNK" position="DL">marshall</person> s third on the season so the bulls on top of the minute 32 to go by a couple of touchdowns and you look at their schedule now theyll have that big thursday night game with cincinnati coming up on october 15th and boy that s going to be a showdown huh well we talked about it you know at the open the big east is starting to separate now theyre starting to separate the bulls and in cincinnati and that big showdown on october 15th in pittsburgh and west virginia trying to fill in the gaps along with connecticut who was off this weekend rutgers off this weekend and you know they get louisville in miami of florida they get to another an opportunity theyve already knocked off one of the big three theyre going to go for number two later this season that s a great point <person player="jim mckenzie" race="UNK" position="OL">jim</person> leavitt said hey we cant play with those guys you got to beat them and they beat florida state now they have a golden opportunity on november 28th against miami that game will be in tampa so that would be a home game for him so a gym liveth <person player="jim mckenzie" race="UNK" position="OL">jim</person> leavitt the head coach of the bulls getting ready for that cincinnati game now in syracuse theyll have the mountaineers of west virginia coming in next weekend so things dont get any easier as they continue to lay the foundation yeah and you look ahead you got cincinnati pittsburgh and in rutgers at the end november 21st so as you said it doesnt get any easier next week they get a week off and then they take on akron so hopefully they can right the ship and do something and hold on to the football next week because both of those teams you take a look at west virginia theyve been coughing up the football as well you mentioned holding on to the football what where does <person player="doug hogue" race="UNK" position="LB">doug</person> marrone take from this football game and he s going to look at it and i like what he said after the minnesota game he says let s say the effort was there but let s not confuse effort with results he s going to look up and see a 34:20 loss for usf but there s got to be some silver lining because they played hard and the game plan was good well the game plan was good and they did play hard but i think this one is a little bit more frustrating because when you take an account you lose the game by 14 points and you give the football away seven times so that s a lot of opportunities where you can have offensively near to go down and get some points and maybe when you have to settle for a field goal instead of punching it in for a touchdown that gap even shortens even more so you got it you got to protect the football that s the number one theme of any football game any coach you ask if you protect the football youve got a chance to win the game well <person player="jim mckenzie" race="UNK" position="OL">jim</person> loveth just picks up the victory that s 92 for him since building this program and he s standing by with quinn when coach what was the biggest challenge that you faced this week well you know we obviously in the first half we werent emotionally playing very very focused football made a lot of mistakes and i dont know if it s because the last game or whatever i just think it s more through just being that much better theyve ever been they were extremely well coached safety they came to play and we were very fortunate that s what youre up 1413 at half what s going on in your mind at that point were in a dogfight well find out what kind of purple team we have that were gonna have to play thirty minutes or a football and and it was gut check time and uh you know just i thought our guys came out respond pretty well how do you best describe creating seven turnovers i dont know you know there are so many turnovers in the first quarter both teams i know who was going to give up the <person player="torrey ball" race="UNK" position="DL">ball</person> more but our defense kid nicole big ones in the second half was huge coach congratulations good road win thank you all right thanks a lot clint so <person player="jim mckenzie" race="UNK" position="OL">jim</person> <person player="aj love" race="UNK" position="WR">love</person> it who picked up his fiftieth winning just a 75th game picks up his 92nd and will be back here and the carry are going to wrap things up right after this commercial message 34 22 final score usf top 10 team the last two years their five and oh now in 2009 our final thought coming up welcome back inside the carrier dome as it empties out here on homecoming for 2009 34:20 usf prevails they head back down to tampa at 5:00 and oh and youre fashionable well i think they play hard you know they come out and play hard defense all the time and i think if they can protect the football offensively you know theyve got a quarterback now that has two starts two big starts and two road wins under his belt so he s going to be huge you know next week when they had that showdown against cincinnati let s take a look at some of the key plays of course it started out kind of sloppy five first half turnovers well it did it started off with a lot of turnovers a lot of humble interceptions theyve done they did it any way you could give up the football they found a way but in between<person player="mike ford" race="UNK" position="RB">mike ford</person>was able to get on the scoreboard and <person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">paulus</person> was able to throw the football at times effectively but he had some turnovers through the air but the big play was the theme on both sides <person player="carlton mitchell" race="UNK" position="WR">mitchell</person> was the big guy going down the field there s another turnover good at good tackle but <person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">paulus</person> will come back if his big playmaker on the outside williams a chance to go up and catch the football couple times in the game here s the second time up in the end zone taking the football away when it was up for grabs it was hid and <person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">paulus</person> again hit from behind and <person player="jason pierrepaul" race="UNK" position="DL">pierrepaul</person> runs in the interception for the touchdown so it was one of those situations where the bulls were able to capitalize on the turnovers not only take the football away but turned it into points and they did a great job of pressuring the pocket <person player="greg paulus" race="UNK" position="QB">paulus</person> did a good job managing the game but just one too many turnovers through the air your thoughts is a former player of the fact that syracuse they turned it over seven times but they didnt quit they got up and they kept swinging well theyre not going to theyve got theyve got somebody that is riding the ship in coach marone and i like what he stands for what he believes in and i think theyre going to be able to be a good team by the end of this season theyre pretty good team now theyre playing hard so just making the same mistake in and once they correct those mistakes offensively defensively and in special teams i think theyre gonna become a more productive team what does marone tell those players now with west virginia coming in next week well theyve got another tough task ahead of them theyve got one of this upper two your big east teams coming in playing at home though they can eliminate the mistakes in capitalised west virginia team that s been coughing up the football so if they can continue to try to get those turnovers defensively create field position and not give it back to west virginia they should be ok look at the standings usf of course five and own now again go back to the last two years where they were cracked the top ten and cincinnati still the team to beat to number ten one of seven top ten teams playing on the road but there at miami ohio so no problem for the bearcats there how do you see that usf cincinnati game shaping up i think it s going to be terrific and i think usf s going to crack that top 25 this week and it s going to be a huge game next week weber eliminates the turnovers going to win that football game all right john thanks sir final score once again the 34:20 bowls over the orange regina to jimmy quinn kuznick and our entire big east
