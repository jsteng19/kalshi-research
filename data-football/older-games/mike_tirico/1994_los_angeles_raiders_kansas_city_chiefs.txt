============================================================

player="patrick bates" race="UNK" position="DB">patrick</person> joe theismann <person player="mark collins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mark</person> malone on the call from arrowhead gentlemen thank you <person player="chris penn" race="UNK" position="WR">chris</person> and this is arrowhead stadium in kansas city where a sellout crowd of 78,000 will watch the renewal of a great rivalry the raiders and the chiefs and the chiefs played the raiders biggest war it was a time to dig as deep as you possibly could to find a way to beat these guys you do that later on that afternoon and i was like maybe to heavyweight fighters this rivalry was built on games of extreme consequence and tonight is no different the raiders scuffled through the first half of the season at four and four and now must pull together to make that promise playoff run the chiefs still think super bowl title yet still seek the consistency that marks all championship teams old rivals with the same old goals in what promises to be the same old war san diego was upset <person player="dan land" race="nonwhite" position="DB">land</person> of the day so kansas city can move to within one game of the division lead with a win and the raiders lead a victory to pull into a second place tie with the chiefs good evening everybody mike <person player="patrick bates" race="UNK" position="DB">patrick</person> along with joe theismann it s great to have you with us for our eighth year of sunday night nfl on espn and we started off with classic rivals joe a lot of people thought that the raiders would end up in the super bowl this year but they have had to scratch and claw just to get back to 500 after that awful start and more than their share of controversy the good news his heart shel says now he has a really good feeling about this team well mike you bring up an interesting point everybody felt that the raiders could be a superbowl team if they could just find a running game and through the first six weeks of the season theyve really struggled but in the <person player="dan land" race="nonwhite" position="DB">land</person> and now they finally have made a commitment to run the football the last couple of weeks <person player="harvey williams" race="nonwhite" position="RB">harvey williams</person> has put together backtoback 100yard rushing games and just this week the former chief has certainly done his share of taunting of his old teammates the raiders and the chiefs have always been great physical contest that s exactly what i expect tonight in this one light and those are the kinds of games that have given the chiefs trouble this year they started three and oh they look like the class of the conference but they have been wildly inconsistent theyre coming off a terrible beating at the hands of buffalo they are five and three but it looks like a shaky five and three well coaches always get a feel for their football teams right about this time and marty schottenheimer he s got to be thrilled with the production that he s getting out of <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">joe montana</person> and <person player="marcus allen" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marcus allen</person> but when he looks at his defense he s got to feel like there s three areas of problems first of all theyve been inconsistent in the secondary secondly given up way too many big plays thirdly they cant stop the run particularly in the nickel now marty has had a great run against the raiders in his tenure as head coach of the chiefs and the way theyve done it mike is theyve done it with great physical football on the defensive side and theyve created turnovers sounds like that s the formula theyre going to need tonight if they hope to beat the raiders absolutely and one of the additions to our coverage this year will come from the sideline <person player="mark collins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mark</person> malone is going to have something special for us each week <person player="mark collins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mark</person> is wonderful to have you with us well thanks mike it s great to be part of this nfl sunday night team you know the game of football continues to become more and more specialized and so too does our coverage im going to spend most of the night tonight focusing with an iso camera on one play we should have an impact on this game we call it the sunday night spotlight and in the spotlight tonight his chiefs linebacker <person player="derrick thomas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">derrick thomas</person> you see him in a replay when he makes his sack were gonna take that a step further were gonna show you his hands and his feet the technique he uses against the pass and the run and how the raiders are going to try to keep him in check we will put that together at a little video report card and represent it to you quarterly so you can see what kind of influence <person player="derrick thomas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">derrick thomas</person> has on this game right all right thank you <person player="mark collins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mark</person> and <person player="derrick thomas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">derrick thomas</person> is certainly one of the reasons that marty schottenheimer has had such great success against the raiders and is perfect here at arrowhead arch shell has never left the stadium with a win as a head coach overall two and seven against the chiefs since taking over the reins of the los angeles raiders these teams have been playing each other since 1960 the raiders with a slight lead the series put the chiefs have won nine of the last eleven <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite"

player="jaime fields" race="UNK" position="LB">jaime</person> williams is giving them something they havent had in a long time a ground game backtoback hundred yard games steve was new ski a combination of size and strength that s made in the anchor of the offensive line he s been voted to four straight pro bowls beautiful atmosphere here at arrowhead stadium two teams that go for the throat williams and laughlin hastur play action <person player="jeff hostetler" race="white" position="QB">hostetler</person> goes for everything on the first play picks it up intended for <person player="tim brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">tim brown</person> but double coverage in <person player="william white" race="nonwhite" position="DB">william white</person> gets his second interception of the season the los angeles raiders had a good idea everybody s been talking about running the football one in the football they come out with playaction but you got to see the safety <person player="jeff hostetler" race="white" position="QB">hostetler</person> makes the fake <person player="tim brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">tim brown</person> runs a little out and up okay he s got <person player="mark collins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mark collins</person> but what about the safety coming from the right <person player="jeff hostetler" race="white" position="QB">jeff hostetler</person> has missed all his long passes this year hi but there s the heat from neal smith you gotta let the qb know youre in the area for haas the 10th interception as opposed to 11 touchdown passes in <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> will go to work playaction to add throws underneath and completes the derek walker his tight end let s take a look at that cheap unit <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> at the ripe old age of 38 has already had four three hundred yard games he s on a pace to throw for over four thousand which would be a career fest <person player="marcus allen" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marcus allen</person> still produces most of the running game a hundred eighteen career touchdown he s number four all time and one of the most underrated linemen to the game tim run hard he s been the starters into the third game of his rookie year behind kimball anders that gets it up to the 39yard on defense for the raiders <person player="chester mcglockton" race="UNK" position="DT">chester</person> mclaughlin has overcome injuries and is now on the verge of stardom five sacks coming from the inside for the first time in their history the raiders used their first draft choice for a linebacker rob frederickson plays the left outside on a unit that needed help and pro bowler <person player="terry mcdaniel" race="nonwhite" position="DB">terry mcdaniel</person> has been the afc defensive player of the week twice this year and matched a careerhigh five interceptions beyond and he chuck s it into the bench area there is a flag down joe used in that hard count he feels like the raiders are coming they go hard count all of a sudden you get him dont forget you only have to get him into the neutral zone and that s the width of the football they do not have to cross over to the other side of the line of scrimmage also defense number 91 fine youre dribbling repeat the down push down archelle told us last night mike the one thing that s killed this ballclub all year has been turnovers that s been his biggest concern its biggest been his biggest concern in the games against the kansas city chiefs they started out first pass interception and these are the two most penalized teams in the nfl that interception by the way the first in 23 quarters for kansas city s defense which lives by the eternal on first and five <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> by wednesday <person player="winston moss" race="nonwhite" position="LB">moss</person> protecting the middle the way <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">joe montana</person> handles the offense is essential tim grunted the center number 61 on <person player="chester mcglockton" race="UNK" position="DT">chester</person> mclaughlin s on the 91 and he has a big lug it could be one of the top five tackles in football right <person player="marcus allen" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marcus allen</person> and <person player="winston moss" race="nonwhite" position="LB">winston moss</person> taking them down dont let him run after they catch the football second and four to a halt <person player="winston moss" race="nonwhite" position="LB">winston</person> mars headed by the ankles to pick up maybe i think right now is when <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> is most in the style of this office do you see my eyes receivers to throw the football to mike usually youd defend it back maybe a tight end dont worry about the wide outs on further kansas city chief often you can spread it out you know right now 38 doesnt sound very old four months and after torte foreman last night <person player="marcus allen" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marcus</person> jana under pressure and down he goes sacked at the 38 <person player="chester mcglockton" race="UNK" position="DT">chester</person> mclaughlin art shell just couldnt say enough about the this guy he already thinks he is in the elite of defensive tackles among among nfl players and his potential is unlimited i think he s the kind of a defensive lineman like a reggie white you cannot block him oneonone to give your senator guards delhi he s just too quick and too powerful naggy our will kick the <person player="tim brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">tim brown</person> to return by a wives <person player="tim brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brown</person> all the way back to the 9 yard

harvie warning at the 25 harry simeon drilled him all peron <person player="neil smith" race="nonwhite" position="DE">neil smith</person> playing with a surgically repaired thumb still leads the line and tackles and has five and a half sacks <person player="derrick thomas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">derrick thomas</person> has six sacks enjoying another allpro year at linebacker after last year

player="marcus allen" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marcus allen</person> called from the best athlete ever played with and second and seven williams on the door by <person player="joe phillips" race="white" position="DT">joe phillips</person> like <person player="marcus allen" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marcus allen</person> the year before and here s some pushing and shoving after the play <person player="harvey williams" race="nonwhite" position="RB">harvey williams</person> comes back in a payback game he wants it in force play he wants it in the worst way and he said a lot of things he s made comments about feeling like marty didnt want him to succeed he s talked about it in the press <person player="neil smith" race="nonwhite" position="DE">neil smith</person> said he told us the other day said listen this is not a good game were not feeling real good about ourselves and <person player="harvey williams" race="nonwhite" position="RB">harvey</person> should learn to shut up because were not real happy and we want to take it out on somebody anger 290pound people there is a flag down the officials are indicating that the play was dead before the pick this will be interesting to sort out and dick hand tack will do it it looks like he s in charge he s telling everybody where to go i like those caps i dont they had to keep there s no play false start prior to the snap on the offense five yard penalty still third down so that means there was no plot yeah but i want to tell you something there may show on the game sheet that there s no play but <person player="jeff hostetler" race="white" position="QB">jeff hostetler</person> made a really stupid bonehead play if you want to throw the <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ball</person> away throw it out of bounds dont throw it at a big offense defensive lineman that was an awful decision would have been a second interception in as many he s made two bad decisions watch this as he s running away spread the net on the right side number 78 slides so the place should be blown dead but i dont see an official jump here comes the official good job good job by the official coming in good call when during nichols s thanks very much you know every now and then you go pick a cherry and falls off a tree right his lap but it s decision by jeff hardshell talked about <person player="derrick thomas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">derrick thomas</person> a lot last night about what they have to do to protect their offense from that man he puts <person player="derrick thomas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">derrick thomas</person> in the category of bruce smith you have to doubleteam them on <person player="neil smith" race="nonwhite" position="DE">neil smith</person> you have to doubleteam on jr say how you have to dougie team them so every time derrick is going to commit himself to rush jeff youre going to either see a tight end chipping on him which beats are going to try and get just a piece of him or the fullback or running back he will not be blocked by one person and he will not be blocked alone by a running back they were resetting the game clock because that play did not count so the time should not have one eleven after the penalty theyre go through the first down marker where <person player="jeff hostetler" race="white" position="QB">hostetler</person> went down the the extra yardage on the fumble we just saw vintage <person player="derrick thomas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">derrick thomas</person> derrick told me that this offseason he studied warren s tailors relentless nature now a year ago quit right there he would have said oh i cant make the play but this is a new derek <person player="derrick thomas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">thomas</person> and <person player="jeff hostetler" race="white" position="QB">jeff hostetler</person> was not thrilled about the new derek thumb the old one was a problem and that one s going to be a bigger problem so <person player="jeff gossett" race="white" position="P">gossett</person> will come on to kick the <person player="danan hughes" race="UNK" position="WR">danan hughes</person> dassit with the best average in the afc third in the nfl mic there was a classic case on derricks paris where they tried to block him with one big offensive lineman and he s just too quick he s too quick they went against what they wanted to do nice high floating kick secular 25 and gets one yard out of a good coverage by special teams 45yard punt <person player="aaron wallace" race="nonwhite" position="LB">aaron wallace</person> makes the tackle and <person player="derrick thomas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">derrick thomas</person> causing havoc in the backfield already nothing nothing first quarter we said injuries might have an impact that i john all playing with a bad back and it s already showing joe and it showed up on the last play mike john all tried to block <person player="chester mcglockton" race="UNK" position="DT">chester</person> mclaughlin on the sack now here he comes off the left side bolts the left tackle in good position there gets the hands out but right now stop as you see you see how his rear end here should be over here under his body he s going to get thrown away and that s the problem he couldnt get himself under his back he s too scared chiefs have the <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ball</person> for the second time now here on 46 in the flat de alicante tackler dives forward we just got back to about the line of scrimmage <person player="eddie anderson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">eddie anderson</person> of whose safety spot to make the stop john alden friday is back by him a little bit more air he sets again im oclock and this is becoming a mismatch he just cant move he s going to have to make better contact or i wouldnt be surprised if he s not out of that lineup in a hurry all even talked about retirements in the last few days because he says he wants to be able to live the rest of his life <person player="marcus allen" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marcus</person> nice cut to get free and <person player="marcus allen" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marcus allen</person> dive to the it s a first down were going to show you a view from our espn goalposts cam so you get a chance to see the patients and the eyes of a <person player="marcus allen" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marcus allen</person> it s out to the right the power side of the line he sets it up and he just continues to slide outside turns up fear and always finishes falling on <person player="marcus allen" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marcus allen</person> trademark he s approaching 10,000 yards a <person player="mark collins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mark</person> only eight other players in the history of this game of reached <person player="marcus allen" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marcus</person> hiphigh <person player="nolan harrison" race="nonwhite" position="DE">harrison</person> <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">jerry ball</person> nearly got it and then greg bit kirk the middle linebacker finished them all there s some intensity on defense out here isnt there yes it s sickening <person player="marcus allen" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marcus</person> of course had his own ax to grind a year ago coming over from the raiders and played very well against his former teammates it still means a lot to him al davis the man who eventually let him go get in the back field again and beaker makes the second consecutive stop and weve got some more pushing there is absolutely no love loss here particularly between the guys that have changed uniforms in the halfback position <person player="harvey williams" race="nonwhite" position="RB">harvey williams</person> and their <person player="marcus allen" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marcus allen</person> i talked to <person player="marcus allen" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marcus</person> in the locker room yesterday and i said now tell me how do you feel about the raiders is it specially she s well publicly i wouldnt say it is but i want to tell you something it is special and itll always be special and just so people think you didnt betray a confidence he went on to say a publicly on out some contact downfield no flag davus covered like a blanket by <person player="terry mcdaniel" race="nonwhite" position="DB">terry mcdaniel</person> that s a great move by the raiders defensive lady that time they brought three people from the right side to put pressure on joe and force him to try and throw the <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ball</person> long you try and throw the <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ball</person> up against these corners not good things are happening see everybody coming to the right side and it allows the big guy in the middle to get to him joe kidd said his feet therefore he cant make the good throw down the field <person player="tim brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brown</person> cygnus fair catch makes it up to 26 only 34 yards but no chance of any return we are still scoreless first quarter john being attended to by the kansas city training staff on the sidelines these example with the back property to appear to be working on his ankle down 17 arizona s leavitt pictures now <person player="chester mcglockton" race="UNK" position="DT">chester</person> mclaughlin returned the cages with those big gloves up seven might mean to point a finger at that thing his fingers so big it like covers the whole side of the line who s he going to point to probably pointing to the guy with the <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ball</person> since i got i got it he s mine five to the 31 <person player="david whitmore" race="nonwhite" position="DB">whitmore</person> gave him a shot <person player="harvey williams" race="nonwhite" position="RB">harvey williams</person> wrote the rare one outside when you take a look at his wife s chart that s not really where he wins the football he sees run 22 times 130 yards outside 61 in the tackle area between the guards and on the outside right this is where he s going to run the football right up in the middle that s where they wanted to be and one of the reasons that <person player="jeff hostetler" race="white" position="QB">hostetler</person> s numbers are down this year williams again <person player="neil smith" race="nonwhite" position="DE">neil smith</person> and <person player="dale carter" race="nonwhite" position="DB">dale carter</person> stopped it mike i know it s 30 short but i think the raiders have got to even maybe try a run here again you would think it s a bet because they need to establish the fact that theyre going to run the football theyre not going to abandon it art came out with the big plate first they they get they get jeff scrambling around now youve got to make this a physical football game you got to make it raiders football kansas city is in its nickel defense which has not been a strong point for the lately now those two williams out of the backfield great catch harpy williams stumbled before the <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ball</person> got there he was on his way down and still had the concentration to pull it in 424 yard you know how we talked about you got to give coverage people credit for sax this is a case where you have to give the raider offensive line credit for the completion look at the time <person player="jeff hostetler" race="white" position="QB">jeff hostetler</person> has look at the job on the offensive line <person player="derrick thomas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">derrick thomas</person> a nonfactor jeff hangs the <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ball</person> up excellently even though <person player="harvey williams" race="nonwhite" position="RB">harvey</person> was losing his footing he still made the catch pretty throw and a great catch by <person player="harvey williams" race="nonwhite" position="RB">harvey williams</person> in the kansas city territory first time play action <person player="jeff hostetler" race="white" position="QB">hostetler</person> under pressure nikhil from behind gets the sack his fourth of the year for darrin mikkel the youngster who came out early was a supplemental draft choice and has tremendous raw talent nicoll gets the sack but neal smith makes this play happen on scrap panic he doesnt get fooled by the playaction fake he holds a position outside does not allow jeff to scramble outside of him there were a net full therefore mikkel comes from behind to make the play after the sack second and 14 williams on the toss touch the name that s a couple flag is down on the board that is a play in my opinion that is not suited for the los angeles raiders offensively theyre too big up front to try and get the guys running laterally false start offense prior to the snap number 78 fiveyard penalty still second down scrap an act to tackle it s a second false start and you know what because playing across from him is neal smith you see that happen to a lot of offensive tackles when youre up against the smith guys neal and bruce or against the <person player="derrick thomas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">derrick thomas</person> when you got really quick rushers outside they have to get moving a little bit ahead sometimes too early you saw these jeans the two most penalized on the league marty schottenheimer was funny sis good grief weve got more penalties no later sokka and 19 a lot of time boss scrambles throws short and complete <person player="tim brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">tim brown</person> couldnt hold it <person player="david whitmore" race="nonwhite" position="DB">whitmore</person> was right there with him and weve got more pushing and shoving back near where <person player="jeff hostetler" race="white" position="QB">hostetler</person> was <person player="neil smith" race="nonwhite" position="DE">neil smith</person> in his second confrontation so far that time with <person player="kevin gogan" race="white" position="OG">kevin gogan</person> you know we talked about the offensive lineman getting help <person player="derrick thomas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">derrick thomas</person> coming from the left side <person player="robert jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="OT">robert jenkins</person> does a good job but there s <person player="harvey williams" race="nonwhite" position="RB">harvey williams</person> just he s not going to do anything but annoy him and maybe grab him on occasion but that time you get both nineteen drop one williams gets to the 46 yard line so it would be fourth and about 13 mikkel made the stop and nickel defense that the kansas city chiefs play has been a problem for him people have rushed for almost ten yards of carry on so if they can get through the night it matched up with the raider nickel and not give up a lot of yards theyll have to feel that theyve improved in that area this is a very conservative call but you can understand why you sort of get the feeling first team to 14 points may win this this game settling into a field position game <person player="danan hughes" race="UNK" position="WR">hughes</person> weights at his 10 gossip goes for the corner and doesnt get it on the 46 yards but theyll bring it out to the 20th <person player="mark collins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mark collins</person>on <person player="tim brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">tim brown</person> 3:15 to go 1st quarter <person player="james trapp" race="nonwhite" position="DB">james trapp</person>ing back up defensive back for the raiders was flagged for 15 yards for a facemask penalty on that pine and you go down and covered kicks he s trying to get away from mincey and he just grabs his facemask and they got him that s just a silly mistake you know the 15 yards for that in this kind of a game to mike you know that theyre going to be looking for anything that has anything to resemble an infraction solutely so kansas city gets a breakdown field position youll start from their own 35 instead of the 12 well that was a bad exchange of yardage scrimmage from the punt was just outside the 45 so really they net ten yards on the right neither team has been able to do much of anything on offense with <person player="max montoya" race="white" position="OG">max montoya</person> another season was so thrilled with what he thought the raiders could do this year wanted to be a part of it again this year <person player="greg hill" race="UNK" position="RB">greg hill</person> the rookie from texas a&amp;m in and takes it out to about the 38 yard line is blocking back another lucky <person player="donnell bennett" race="UNK" position="RB">donnell bennett</person> gary <person player="derrick graham" race="nonwhite" position="OG">graham</person> is in a tackle for <person player="john alt" race="nonwhite" position="OT">john alt</person> and that means consent we will go back to right tackle that s <person player="derrick graham" race="nonwhite" position="OG">graham</person> the 50year man out of appalachian state second and six <person player="winston moss" race="nonwhite" position="LB">winston</person> morris on the tackle you know the one thing ive noticed with this raider defensive line is theyre really getting some great penetration up the middle <person player="chester mcglockton" race="UNK" position="DT">chester</person> mclaughlin coming off the right side that time <person player="nolan harrison" race="nonwhite" position="DE">nolan harrison</person> firing up inside very disruptive to an offensive blocking scheme when the defensive line gets penetration what a huge defensive line <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ball</person> is 3:10 mclaughlin 3:10 that s what theyre listed i cant believe either one of those guys get down here and <person player="nolan harrison" race="nonwhite" position="DE">nolan harrison</person> is 290 the only light weight out there is <person player="anthony smith" race="nonwhite" position="DE">anthony smith</person> he s 265 crisp hen an additional wide receiver for the chiefs <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> find anybody and then throws it away as he takes you by that time the linebackers and the defensive backs did a great job the linebackers underneath holding off the crossing patterns <person player="terry mcdaniel" race="nonwhite" position="DB">terry mcdaniel</person> staying locked up with the receiver crisp a no rookie against <person player="terry mcdaniel" race="nonwhite" position="DB">terry mcdaniel</person> probably one of the top three corners in the <person player="lake dawson" race="UNK" position="WR">lake</person> he s looking in seeing what <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> s doing but yet still keeping pace when <person player="chris penn" race="UNK" position="WR">penn</person> tries to stop he goes back with them and if <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> cant find an open receiver you can guess there isnt a gr kicks another one skyhigh and <person player="tim brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brown</person> will make the fair catch the 30 rare it s been an exchange of punts and right crosses so far 143 to go first below <person player="mark collins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mark</person> but mike i talked to <person player="derrick thomas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">derrick thomas</person> is before the game he said the most important thing were going to do is get off on the snap count and get upfield from there it could make a lot of moves check out the note play early in the second drive <person player="derrick thomas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">thomas</person> comes off the football field right here and he gets the guy beat it s a pressure it goes down as no play but it left a lasting impression he gets help on the second play that is <person player="robert jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="OT">jenkins</person> but again <person player="derrick thomas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">thomas</person> does a great job using his hand something he says he s doing much better he gets back inside crosses the tackle the forest bubble when they doubleteam and that s how nickel is getting open for the sacks mike ryan <person player="mark collins" race="nonwhite"

williams" race="nonwhite" position="TE">jamie williams</person> did not stand a chance holy chopper these people coming after each other second and ten afternoon the readers want to timeout ive been

smith</person> and theyre gonna look like that so he s just checking out those guys in red shirts well here s <person player="harvey williams" race="nonwhite" position="RB">harvey williams</person> opinion of why things did not work out and he was drafted by kansas city i dont know that was something personal that might he didnt <person player="mark collins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mark</person> had against me and i still dont know right now only marty knows that and you know like i said ive been saying earlier im in a place where i want to play it from the beginning i felt like i was gonna be a la rating when i came out out of college but i didnt happen so im like aaaah davis you know is yeah i got you now so im in la marty schottenheimer said you know we gave him we think every chance we could to make him succeed he was after all their number one draft choice that is a guy that you want to succeed absolutely doesnt look good for your record if youre number ones bus down second and ten barbie william certainly not back in <person player="jeff hostetler" race="white" position="QB">hostetler</person> in a flat rat back wheels to a first down and <person player="mark collins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mark</person> wheels to a first down and <person player="mark collins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mark collins</person> was the man who hidden his hurt he suffered a deep v rose a week ago had to be carried off the field a guy who was a tremendous acquisition from the new york giants a coroner who has never been a flashing feels that he and darryl <person player="tracy greene" race="UNK" position="TE">greene</person> are the last two of the old breed for the second week in a row he has gone down hard right side of your screen <person player="jeff hostetler" race="white" position="QB">hostetler</person> throws it out in the flat raft and makes the catch now he throws himself down and it looks like a head right in the know and then he got him right in the head flex it left me a raft just knees him and jams his neck back in and he s down it s like a <person player="george jamison" race="nonwhite" position="LB">george</person> foreman right youre gone campus not to tense random yet used to playful phoenix targets back to the grand game barbie williams cant shake go daran nickel has been the beneficiary of <person player="derrick thomas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">derrick thomas</person> and <person player="neil smith" race="nonwhite" position="DE">neil smith</person> playing outside people have to pay double respect to them and nickels allowed to go oneonone inside im winding down let s see if the raiders choose to get a playoff and <person player="jeff hostetler" race="white" position="QB">hostetler</person> does not and that is going to end a hardhitting in kansas city well be back in a moment what for everybody <person player="mark collins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mark collins</person> not seriously injured although he did suffer a concussion so his return tonight will be doubtful but indicative of the kind of hitting weve had in the first quarter wow the chiefs and raiders get together as lenny <person player="lake dawson" race="UNK" position="WR">dawson</person> and ben davidson ben davidson said in the beginning it s going to be a war and that s what it s boiled down to with the raider with the chiefs losing today excuse me with the chargers rising today the game takes on significance because everybody gets to move up a notch on them and of course the teams have got games against the chargers so you know it makes it more and more important the raiders have rushed for only 24 yards the longest run of the game by houston seven yards and overthrows this been intended for <person player="andrew glover" race="nonwhite" position="TE">glover</person> is titan to be a double coverage at their <person player="david whitmore" race="nonwhite" position="DB">whitmore</person> was improbable and behind the linebacker <person player="george jamison" race="nonwhite" position="LB">george</person> jameson <person player="jeff hostetler" race="white" position="QB">hostetler</person> now only two out of five 36 yards and one pick the offensive numbers do not look good on either side and they are yards rushing 24:23 raiders have an edge thirty two to three in passive three <person player="jeff hostetler" race="white" position="QB">hostetler</person> dumps it for timmy <person player="tim brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brown</person> and he dives for the first down to 45 yard line gain of 11 <person player="tim brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">tim brown</person> had the best year last year of any receiver in raiders history and that is a mouthful 80 catches 11 hundred and 80 yards he s on pace to do better than that this year <person player="tim brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">tim brown</person> working on <person player="dale carter" race="nonwhite" position="DB">dale carter</person> now <person player="dale carter" race="nonwhite" position="DB">carter</person> s in his zone so he lets them go inside now <person player="tim brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brown</person> sees the soft spot he sees jeff in trouble set us down we can make the play he knows exactly how far he has to get for the first down <person player="marcus allen" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marcus allen</person> <person player="derrick thomas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">thomas</person> made the tackle at the 41 yard line excuse me <person player="harvey williams" race="nonwhite" position="RB">harvey williams</person> excuse us switch jerseys for you nice job by the offensive line of the raiders just all they do is get in front of the chiefs defensive people and allow <person player="harvey williams" race="nonwhite" position="RB">harvey</person> to pick a lane or a crease to go through neither team has even gotten close enough to attempt the field goal so williams on the talk behind and as he got inside the 40yard line <person player="dale carter" race="nonwhite" position="DB">dale carter</person> and white came out from the secondary i still dont like that place too much and it s tough to run laterally on the kansas city chiefs <person player="jeff hostetler" race="white" position="QB">jeff hostetler</person> likes to work in a specific area there s the 15 yard area and look at the amount of passes he throws and write about here s where <person player="tim brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">tim brown</person> made the catch for the first down before so that gives you an idea of what the hoss is looking for and really people have defended that outside speed very meager numbers deep constantly under pressure and theyll blow this one did it look like it was moving in leg shot the rocket tried to get out of the chute quick and wound up stutter stepping and illegally moving number 86 all starts prior to the stamp number 86 on the offense fiveyard generally still third down now the rocket had ignition one second early well you know that changes playcalling for our shell and his staff because at third and three you really got the defense playing defense at 39 youve got no choice basically now but to put the <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ball</person> in the air just outside the 43yard line spoilers first half i think in this kind of a case you have to spy <person player="jeff hostetler" race="white" position="QB">jeff hostetler</person> dude you have to sign somebody on defense to get in jeff s face in a hurry if he does break the pocket he is the second leading rusher for the ballclub what better person to possibly be his five and erica crowd on its feet again flag is down <person player="andrew glover" race="nonwhite" position="TE">glover</person> shakes the tackle and dives flip 33 yard line now to check the penalty he would have the first down <person player="darren anderson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">darren anderson</person> number 44 makes the stop offside against the chiefs so the play will stand to gain 10 defense number 58 line up in the neutral zone finley is declined first down well the spy was a little too visible that time but you know it s interesting yeah <person player="andrew glover" race="nonwhite" position="TE">andrew glover</person> really had a choice to either go play professional basketball or a professional football he still has aspirations to go play hope at some point that time he showed some great sheet in dodging gayle <person player="dale carter" race="nonwhite" position="DB">carter</person> and picking up the first down the steam generators the deepest penetration hasta erasmus im on down near the 25yard line <person player="jay taylor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jay taylor</person> on the coverage the pasta continues to get the time he s getting mike dave adolf and the staff of the chiefs are going to have to commit to come after more than four people look at him stand there he looks to his left he looks to the middle he slides a little bit to the right finds rathmann flicks it out for a nine yard game raskind only caught 11 passes through eight games he s parked two tonight 20 up pushed down at the 17yard line <person player="william white" race="nonwhite" position="DB">william white</person> the safety had to make the tackle the raiders are now into one of the areas that have been a concern for them defensively when the other team gets in their red area look at the hole up the middle nice job by that old line gc sprinting to come in and block on the middle linebacker youve forced the defensive back to make the play that s from our goal post cam <person player="harvey williams" race="nonwhite" position="RB">harvey</person> does a nice job of finding the another gaping hole near the 10yard line the strong safety <person player="david whitmore" race="nonwhite" position="DB">david whitmore</person> made the tackle this time theyre running over big old <person player="kevin gogan" race="white" position="OG">kevin gogan</person> all six feet seven 310 plus of them number 66 just continues to pound away and give you a big lane right there hell go down hard and give him a lane to move right up through here go just driving him off the <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ball</person> because he was the threeact create dallas barbie williams again and joe you pointed out earlier <person player="harvey williams" race="nonwhite" position="RB">harvey williams</person> gets the majority of his yardage up the middle they run three straight times you decide to try i think it s great for a little back to be able to do that we see with them at smith thorny powers if you only look at their run charts i think theyll see exactly the same thing you can hide the little guys get them through the creases quick and that s where the holes open up the quickness <person player="jeff hostetler" race="white" position="QB">hostetler</person> again with time six yard line intended for <person player="tim brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brown</person> and good coverage by <person player="charles mincy" race="nonwhite" position="DB">charles</person> minzy and this will force the fieldgoal defense does a good job of tying up all the receivers that s one of the problems michael you have speed on the offensive side of the <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ball</person> when you get down closer to the goal line it negates all the speed you have this is where i think the raiders really missing ethan dworkin who was an exceptional receiving tight end <person player="andrew glover" race="nonwhite" position="TE">andrew</person> brother could become mad jeg er with a he s not out of 12 this year they get the <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ball</person> down and take the putter thrower there is a down on the play you know something the official should go over and talk this one over even if there wasnt a flag they should just go over and talk it over false start offense tired of the snap left guard gossiped with a great catch of the snap and the hole what a terrific job look at the catch and now he moves himself out of the way and still wins about the perfect hole and great patience by jagger he just waits and then just puts it through damn took the center nearly al airmail that one back for two yards and dan will get another opportunity this time it s a 33 yard attempt time is called 951 to go in the half nothing nothing arc s shell like all of us barney schottenheimer the same thing wondering what is going on there s kurt schottenheimer special teams code to achieve dont explain to us what happened i was just gonna say we do not know this it s the reason for that stopping but there is no yardage going either again a 33yard attempt to jagger out of oh still scoreless so he makes an incredible kick off the horrible stamp and then misses one from 33 hold the phone there s another flag down when jagger is really hot kicking teen not counting back out on to the field so it looks like the penalty is not going to go against kansas city that is one of the most bizarre layups ive ever seen in my life walking missile off against the raiders well everybody s walked over to <person player="kevin gogan" race="white" position="OG">kevin gogan</person> so quite possibly it had to be a personal foul that s what im assuming we still havent heard anything would you like this one the be my kite uh yes it s 15 yards it dick one i guess it s our choice it yeah pretty much it a choice here you can write in at home tell us what youd like it to be dick while regardless theyre going to spot the <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ball</person> up around the 39 yard line in kansas city well have i know this kansas city s on offense the raiders are on defense you got it and the <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ball</person> is on the 38 yard line of kansas city and we have no score with 948 to go second quarter and we have no clue what just happened that s right too i wonder if dick has like one of those beepers and we could like call up and say i dont think so you know if you let us know what s going on help you be with us for nfl gameday that s next sunday it s a special time remember 11:45 eastern <person player="chris penn" race="UNK" position="WR">chris</person> berman tom jackson <person player="chris penn" race="UNK" position="WR">chris</person> mortensen phil simms with the most comprehensive pregame show the nfl then at 7 oclock primetime all the highlights of all the games and then at 8 joe and i will be a basildon on the detroit is the lions hosted tampa bay buccaneers we get to see for my money the greatest pure running back in the game barry sanders who now leads the nfl in rushing a thousand david cray came in today for the detroit lions threw three touchdown passes there s a chance we might see a new quarterback in detroit next week he lit it up we are told that <person player="kevin gogan" race="white" position="OG">kevin gogan</person> was flagged for personal foul for punching <person player="neil smith" race="nonwhite" position="DE">neil smith</person> <person player="neil smith" race="nonwhite" position="DE">neil</person> looks no worse for wear <person player="donnell bennett" race="UNK" position="RB">bennett</person> and hill are the running backs and great hill on the top there is another flag down and so is hill after no game what a great job by <person player="chester mcglockton" race="UNK" position="DT">chester</person> mcgraw can firing through the hole and almost making the play but got close enough to create a property both sides defense number 99 line up in the neutral zone fiveyard penalty repeat the down that s <person player="winston moss" race="nonwhite" position="LB">winston moss</person> let s go back to the personal foul play the 15yarder then moved the <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ball</person> out to the 38 here s <person player="kevin gogan" race="white" position="OG">gogan</person> it wolf that bumped by <person player="neil smith" race="nonwhite" position="DE">neil smith</person> and then pushes him and as usual when you retaliate you get caught i guess the idea is to throw the first shot yes it really is it s always a second guy to get snail first and five after the offside penalty <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> and they could poop like derek that s just a great individual effort by <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">joe montana</person> and a terrific effort breaking a tackle by derek walker british he s contained excellent job by <person player="nolan harrison" race="nonwhite" position="DE">harrison</person> outside walker reaches back now he breaks the tackle instead of trying to make the tackle the defensive back wench for swatting the <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ball</person> and he goes in through the six len <person player="lin elliott" race="white" position="K">elliott</person> for the point after true walker played four years with the chargers as an hback he says he loves this offense espn sunday night nfl is once you buy logo athletic get real with authentic team apparel by oldsmobile and youre authorized aurora retailers and by transamerica for life insurance and financial services about power of the pyramid is working for you 7nothing kansas city leading the raiders with 922 to go second quarter mike <person player="patrick bates" race="UNK" position="DB">patrick</person> joe theismann <person player="mark collins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mark</person> malone my entire espn crew with you from arrowhead the rocket waiting for the kickoff from lewin elliot this my al back there with <person player="alexander wright" race="nonwhite" position="WR">alexander</person> right a couple of partners and the rocket from the 11th away from elliot dances had a bounds across the 45 about the 47 yard line a 37 yard return a timeout with nine twelve to go first half and a seven raiders by one game in the standings leading this games seven nothing and that man dan salamu is part of a very interesting defensive scheme that the chiefs play he does not play on the <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ball</person> you see him off the <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ball</person> almost did a half linebacker half defensive lineman this allows him to flow down the line of scrimmage he s not easy to doubleteam and he can pursue and make plays this one against the seahawks he just runs on down just like a linebacker makes a play that s why he plays a yard off the <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ball</person> this is the only defense that you see that he is not having the kind of the year he s had in the past course neither as the rest went to dave eight off defensive unit this thought for the right the pocket complete at the 42 should be enough for first down and <person player="jay taylor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jay taylor</person> on the coverage remember <person player="jay taylor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">taylor</person> s in there because <person player="mark collins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">collins</person> suffered a concussion you know we were talking about dance <person player="marcus allen" race="nonwhite" position="RB">allen</person> lewin and the philosophies behind gave 8 off the defensive coordinator when he was with the raiders he did that with golan he played them off because theyre sort of short and they have great mobility and allows him to slide them down the line arby williams bangs for about four we showed you and film what it looks like now im going to show you there he is he s gonna slide down here and make the hit and make the clerk gets the center slides the slides and see him slide up he did get caught in the watch he managed to slide his feet make the play if you go back a few years it looks an awful lot like tom landry s flexp fencing down a little bit like again he s only one guy flexible 13 karen s chloe to karen picks up about three more therell be a couple shy of the first down <person player="david whitmore" race="nonwhite" position="DB">whitmore</person> makes another tackle from his safety spot and <person player="tim brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">tim brown</person> no attempts except for one to trying it outside the wide receiver and that was <person player="tim brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">tim brown</person> raiders vertical game has become nonexistent in effect until you to run the <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ball</person> i think it will open up with time <person player="tim brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brown</person> to the 25yard line <person player="dale carter" race="nonwhite" position="DB">dale carter</person> makes the spot i like that in the north fence of skinner you me everybody watches doing they went back to pass he was going to go to <person player="tim brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">tim brown</person> they bring them in from the outside in short motion he starts down like he s going to go inside there s the motion starts up the field let s the end clear little shape inside great job on <person player="jay taylor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">taylor</person> now he gets in the soft area first down there s no doubt doubt jeff hostile is going to focus focus fire <person player="jeff hostetler" race="white" position="QB">hostetler</person> s it s seven of 11 84 yards whoops to the end zone alexandr right may have gotten away with a push up and that s what <person player="dale carter" race="nonwhite" position="DB">dale carter</person> is peeping about but no flag <person player="jeff hostetler" race="white" position="QB">hostetler</person> lobbied last year when the broncos made that big free agent off for the <person player="tim brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">tim brown</person> he went to al davis he went off in shell he went to everybody who would listen to say look if youre gonna match anybody s offer match this one because we want to keep <person player="tim brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">tim brown</person> second and ten the outside play for some yardage and stadium bound to get very close to another first care <person player="dale carter" race="nonwhite" position="DB">carter</person> again made the tackle that s the first time the cosplay is giving the man the oppressive 88 something you ever since <person player="mark collins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mark collins</person> got beaned in the head very little pushing and shoving very little joy even saw a smile and hardly way that s a great boy it took all the hostility out of the game not the competitiveness but the hostility great point joe and movement everywhere tracy simeon and <person player="jeff hostetler" race="white" position="QB">hostetler</person> whorfin at each other bull starts offense prior to the snap fiveyard penalty still down third time time to say have had third and short and had a penalty to put them out of you know like you had said earlier you were not option that offensive cadence system she s not that complicated mike im telling you it doesnt take anything the constant plip <person player="jeff hostetler" race="white" position="QB">hostetler</person> hangs in there throws incomplete intended for blubbering is covered by menacing there s another flag down and the chiefs indicating it is against the writers that is going to be on <person player="robert jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="OT">robert jenkins</person> the left tackle on <person player="derrick thomas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">derrick thomas</person> <person player="derrick thomas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">thomas</person> starts hard up outside comes inside <person player="robert jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="OT">jenkins</person> has nothing to do but the tackle and grab it the interesting choice here it would be fourth down and seven if you let them kick the field goal from here do you take the yards and give them another third down shot i think you take the yards and take your chances with your your line because youre going to have third down and 15 or 16 you take your chances here maybe you can stop holding offense number 64 10yard penalty repeat the down third down watch the left part of your here to actually write you funny at <person player="derrick thomas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">derrick thomas</person> goes up hard <person player="robert jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="OT">robert jenkins</person> tries to stay with him <person player="jeff hostetler" race="white" position="QB">hostetler</person> just got rid of it look like the entire defensive line met at gem pasta third down in 15 they put their ears back and they just come derrick comes from one side <person player="neil smith" race="nonwhite" position="DE">neil</person> comes from the other and you sprinkle in a darren nickel and you got a problem here they come boom boom boom that s hoss that s where he goes off the <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ball</person> hard they try to run a little screen in the middle but jeff doesnt even have a chance to set it up officially this is a 50 thank you sir there got the distance and it s true so after hooking is first when jagger comes through from 15 the raiders are on the board with 529 ago line 5th in the afc and kickoff returns at twenty four point two from the seventh straight up the sideline and dropped as he got to the 26 you will not believe the time of possession in the second quarter i mean <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">joe montana</person> and his offense have been on the field 26 seconds this quarter and the raiders has been on the field nine minutes and in this quarter the chiefs have scored seven the raiders have scored three and the big play of course the only big play the 57 yard touchdown pass outside of that the chiefs have gained only 26 yards in time <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> throws complete to davis knocked down by mckay the money caught <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">joe montana</person> continued in thrall and when you look at his record when he throws touchdown passes there 13 and 1 when he does not show a td pass they are 2 &amp; 6 so basically he s done his job tonight everybody else has got to start playing football he s not one running the to go <person player="marcus allen" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marcus allen</person> it s a push down at the 38 yard line great short garnett s runner all these holes especially around the goal this has a great way of finishing he turns his body he knows exactly what he needs to do very smart knows when to get out of bounds when to stay in bounds still a great back first down and hell will get the character <person player="chester mcglockton" race="UNK" position="DT">chester</person> mclaughlin showed you a little bit of the speed coming out for this tackle spot although you would never call <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">joe montana</person> ordinary here s a look at the seasonal averages these different categories 257 completions out of 405 throws at 634% over 3,000 yards with 21 touchdown passes and 11 interceptions but this year with the chiefs <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> is on a pace to top those averages in every category super joe s projected stats looked like this he shatters the norman completions attempts in half a yard gets close to another first down there s a flag down and back to <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> he will also have small increases in completion percentage and touchdowns the interceptions would also be up a little bit and now well check out the flag those numbers on the right are incredible for a man who s 38 years old i was kidding with him the other day i said how s your arm he said it feels like offense on number 83 the hole was beyond the line of scrimmage and behind the end of the run so we penalize ten yards from the spot of the foul repeat the down second down that s the wide receiver <person player="willie davis" race="nonwhite" position="WR">willie davis</person> so i asked actually how s the army he said it feels great i said it should it s only theyve done it completely repaired it but he has no problems with his arm started out working on the whole offseason working on the rest of his body and physically he feels great has had his ribs banged up this year but that has nothing to do his condition it would have bothered him before but now he s he s worked on his chest to stomach his legs fade himself just physically stronger facing second and thirteen here after the penalty and now weve got another discussion on the field now were set to go second and 13 moving on the offensive line and it looked like a grand number 74 jumped a little early neither art shell nor marty shot lightly with the penalties offense number 77 prior to the snap five yards second down coaches really dont mind penalties as much when you trying to do something but making the mental errors like this drives you crazy when youre making a play when youre blocking or something like that that s understandable window youre standing still and you jump offside that bothers it so now it s second and 18 after backtoback penalties anders and alan behind <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> close to a first down needed to cross this earth excuse me close to getting the yardage back on the penalty got up to near the 38 yard line <person player="winston moss" race="nonwhite" position="LB">winston</person> washing <person player="eddie anderson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">eddie</person> <person player="marcus allen" race="nonwhite" position="RB">allen</person> <person player="eddie anderson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">eddie anderson</person> made the tackle this is where joe has to be careful with the football weve got the <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ball</person> on their own so here s skirt and tim you dont want to force the <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ball</person> someplace where it winds up being kicked off and you get the raiders good field position third and 10 in sec <person player="rob fredrickson" race="white" position="LB">fredrickson</person> hasnt the 30 there s also a flag down the rookie for michigan state and that also looked like a cover except <person player="rob fredrickson" race="white" position="LB">fredrickson</person> the first time the raiders have ever taken a line back the raiders are saying it s against kansas city holding on the defense number 29 holding on the offense number 66 killings are all set third down you know this was fast becoming the dick hancock show let s get a lot of camera time at the time yeah well that s a big break for kansas city instead of the sack and forth along and having the puck ill get another crack at third down last time the raiders made a mistake have resulted in a fifth touchdown play you dont want to give <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> many more opportunity makes the first man misfits all writers are there to cover it and it will bring up a punt well it s a great job by the defense of the los angeles raiders you blitz <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">joe montana</person> on third down in ten you make them throw a hot receiver and get your people out there and execute to play absolutely perfectly defense you know i was talking to jim hoss with the beef burger weinberger coach for the raiders and he talked about rob frederick s and he said he reminds him an awful lot of a <person player="mike young" race="UNK" position="WR">young</person> jackhammer high company weve reached it twominute warning check in with <person player="mark collins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mark</person> malone well mike if it seems that <person player="derrick thomas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">derrick thomas</person> has been a little bit silent it s because he s been getting doubleteamed on just about every play especially a good job by greg scrumping it take a look at this play here they try to work him inside on the stunts even when he goes inside there are two blockers waiting for him no chance at all he goes back outside against <person player="robert jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="OT">jenkins</person> who s filling in for parry and <person player="robert jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="OT">jenkins</person> falls for the inside move for the second time in the game ill tell you what he might have something going with <person player="robert jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="OT">jenkins</person> mike and that s exactly what the raiders dont want <person player="mark collins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mark</person> and theyve done a pretty good job on him since very early in the <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ball</person> game <person player="tim brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">tim brown</person> waited to talk to the park back to the front tank trying to find a lane gets to the sideline up to the 27th 13yard return after a punt of 44 149 to go in the half b92 go on the hamp let s check back with <person player="mark collins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mark</person> malone <person player="mark collins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mark</person> well as we look at <person player="derrick thomas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">derrick thomas</person> who s in the spotlight here s some numbers to wrap up what s been happening to him so far in past these situations nine times he s been doubleteam seven the only time he wasnt doubleteam one screen and one coverage if he s getting that much attention somebody else on that defensive line has got to free up and get to the quarterback mike all right thank you <person player="mark collins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mark</person> and were keep an eye on <person player="derrick thomas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">derrick thomas</person> from your viewpoint now with a minute 49 to go on a half the raiders start from their own 27 draw play williams room to run up to about the 33 tracy s sillier than the with the second and four barbie williams again he will not touchdown that believe 20 market just short dance sally more on the tack and it would be the first time they gave you a good spot one set of chains moved and now the raiders want a timeout theyll stop the clock with a minute eight to go interesting the raiders commitment here mike they get the <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ball</person> with about a minute 49 to go in the half you figure well theyre going to throw the football no they come out they run the eye they run <person player="harvey williams" race="nonwhite" position="RB">harvey williams</person> right up the middle get enough for a first down now all jeff needs is a couple of pass completions he gets within jaegers fugo ranks i mean the raiders have really made the commitment to run the football and theyre getting production and coming up at halftime the fastest three minutes in television <person player="chris penn" race="UNK" position="WR">chris</person> berman with all the highlights a preview of the cowboy 49er matchup which should be a beauty and well be back to arrowhead for a first half recap most people have been looking forward to that cowboy 49er game which occurs next sunday for a long long time appear to be the two premier teams in the nfc and the 49ers getting healthy again which is what they needed on that offensive line barbie williams so far as you look at <person player="neil smith" race="nonwhite" position="DE">neil smith</person> 66 yards on 17 carries going for his third straight hundred yard the way with excellent protection to a sideline had one foot go out for motormen as he tried to make the cut to the shabbat he got the that s the one thing that happens youre not interesting enough for night games mike you get a little bit that it s a little cool here the field gets a little swig and your sight start to slide a little bit on it it s funny how different surfaces react to the spikes and the shoes youre wearing first they had a lot of rain for two days the field was covered a portion appears to be an excellent condition building in it s a fast track second in 10th draw plate away simian stands them straight up along as he just crossed the 40yard line jill <person player="joe phillips" race="white" position="DT">phillips</person> also in there the raiders do not appear to be in a hurry with the clock working its way down toward 40 seconds oh youve got a couple of timeouts left i mean you really dont need to be in a hurry you dont want up there actually one time outlet you dont want to leave a lot of time on the clock for <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">joe montana</person> denver broncos have been talking to the raiders about what happened and theyll play up conservatively geron mikkel makes the stop and count kansas city reviews a timeout to stop the clock and at least force the punt school to surprised with the games at an ivy im surprised that the entire process after they called the second timeout if there was there was a minute and 49 seconds to go they ran it down to a minute and eight seconds i thought then they would try to move the <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ball</person> down the field obviously they feel in control of the game and theyre gonna wait and reload the second half im surprised the raiders have controlled the football but it s the chiefs who had the only touchdown and it was too quick strike to walker 57 yards as he caught the <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ball</person> over the middle and romp in and made of 7 nothing jacob came back with his second field goal attempt he made this one officially now 51 yards to cut the lead to seven to three and that s where we stand with 12 seconds to go in the half now gossip on the pun if youre kansas city you come after us with 12 seconds left no because you less than five yards for the first down you take a chance let him punt it down and kansas city had nobody back they were afraid of the fake and also afraid maybe someone with muffet and they didnt want time expired a 54yard that s the end of the first half with our score the kansas city chiefs seven the raiders jury now has joined <person player="chris penn" race="UNK" position="WR">chris</person> berman for the acura halftime report as they try to pull them in one game of the san diego chargers who were upset this afternoon the raiders need to win to get even with the chiefs in the time for second place in kansas city well get the <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ball</person> as we start the third quarter jeager to kick <person player="ron dickerson" race="UNK" position="RB">ron dickerson</person> that s interesting mike the raiders have got to find some points the chiefs have got to find some offense absolutely <person player="ron dickerson" race="UNK" position="RB">dickerson</person> from the tent just got across 20 leagues out to the 23 yard line let s go down to <person player="mark collins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mark</person> malone <person player="mark collins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mark</person> what do you have well mike as you mentioned with the exception of the long touchdown pass from <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> the raiders have dominated both sides of the line of scrimmage marty schottenheimer says hey were playing one of the best defensive fronts in the league weve got to do a better job but a good because john hall s back looks like it s acting up and he might not be out here for the second half at all mike all right <person player="mark collins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mark</person> thank you never be a tough break for kansas city because all one of the mainstays on that big offensive line and overthrows <person player="winston moss" race="nonwhite" position="LB">winston moss</person> on the coverage take the work at the halftime stats pretty ugly isnt well you know mike it s ugh leave your kansas city chief but if youre a raider this is the kind of contest youre basically into you two very good defensive teams youre very balanced and youre managing just not to score points means it s about as even as it is but look at the discrepancy in plays the raiders have definitely controlled the entire have 20 offensive plays for the kansas city chiefs <person player="marcus allen" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marcus allen</person> hit at the line of scrimmage <person player="nolan harrison" race="nonwhite" position="DE">nolan harrison</person> with the bear hug and slams him down but gerry <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ball</person> is the one who makes the first hit give me an idea what <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">joe montana</person> has been up against throwing the football obviously there arent many yards there it is i mean it s it s meagre five four five behind the line of scrimmage he cannot get the <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ball</person> down into this area downfield that s been the problem they cannot advance the <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ball</person> fast past the line of scrimmage and there s one of the big reasons <person player="chester mcglockton" race="UNK" position="DT">chester</person> the doctor he is had without a supply truck complete the <person player="lake dawson" race="UNK" position="WR">lake dawson</person> and now an official comes in and says caught it and the raiders are really upset it s enough for a first down now overall that it s incomplete mixed signals from two different officials but that s what theyre supposed to do is help each other if one doesnt have a good view the other one has to come in and express himself and explain or found finding out which one of the officials is correct right top part of your screen there s the throw the <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ball</person> is in now did it squirt through his arms that s got to be the question he got his hand certainly under the <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ball</person> no doubt about it question is did it squirt through at some point and wind up on the ground with the incompletion its fourth and eleventh and <person player="tim brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">tim brown</person> waits at his forty waters of all time makes it at the 45yard line again only a 34yard punt from a gr but no chance it will return <person player="jeff hostetler" race="white" position="QB">hostetler</person> talking to fred biletnikoff about what they want to do on offense in this series mike let s let s talk a second about <person player="albert lewis" race="nonwhite" position="DB">albert lewis</person> here he is coming in from the outside he starts up the field now he comes in trying to create a lane but youll see marty schottenheimer has so much respect for him he keeps two people right there to make sure they know where he is when the chiefs come up to punt kurt schottenheimer is going to have all of his guys point out where <person player="albert lewis" race="nonwhite" position="DB">albert lewis</person> is that s how much respect and the fans again trying to cheer on the defenseless held the raiders to a field goal look for <person player="tim brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brown</person> and just overthrown by a stride and again good protection <person player="jeff hostetler" race="white" position="QB">jeff hostetler</person> has had the opportunities to complete passes tonight where <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">joe montana</person> has it he s just missed long on a couple of and watching jeff all year all of his deep passes have been missed long and to me that that s a guy trying not to throw interceptions but just trying to get completions or incomplete he s only 7 out of and one quick <person player="harvey williams" race="nonwhite" position="RB">harvey williams</person> running hard the midfield gain of five <person player="david whitmore" race="nonwhite" position="DB">david whitmore</person> made the tackle and is down and now the training staff will come out and attend a <person player="david whitmore" race="nonwhite" position="DB">whitmore</person> for williams 20 carries 78 yards and joe he has certainly backed up the boasts he made coming in he sure has i mean when you take a look at his rushed chart there he is 62 yards right up the middle and most of it is out of the eye and he s either here here or here he hasnt been real successful trying to go outside everything s been right up the gut weve got a timeout on the field 1331 to go third quarter it s still the chiefs by four over the raiders espn s sunday night nfl is brought to you by american honda who has been making quality automobiles in america for the past 12 years by russell athletic for really tough athletic wear that can survive anything get russell athletic get tough and buy motel 6 for a clean comfortable room at the lowest prices of any national chain stay at motel 6 <person player="david whitmore" race="nonwhite" position="DB">david whitmore</person> abele the field under his own power but limping noticeably when he came out theyve also lost <person player="doug terry" race="UNK" position="DB">doug terry</person> a defensive back he was poked more hell return <person player="derrick thomas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">thomas</person> got a little early start and the flag deployed well theyve obviously gotten over to <person player="mark collins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mark</person> college situation in their back to pushing and shoving all sides defense number 58 unabated path to the quarterback five yards first down hello i like that to the quarterback now weve moved up more than just offside and these are the two most penalized teams in the league the raiders nine for seventy yards tonight kansas city three for twenty but the penalty gives the raiders have first down woman schwartz s he tried to make this cut and covered by nipple at the line of scrimmage the last 21 plays that the raiders have run have either been a <person player="harvey williams" race="nonwhite" position="RB">harvey williams</person> run or a pass to <person player="tim brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">tim brown</person> that s the last 21 place that is amazing with all the weapons that you see with the la raiders what happens is they make people defend the speed outside and they really work inside the numbers inside the ashes with the running game inside the numbers with the pass code chan here comes the blitz basket for a hit and drop by <person player="derrick thomas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">thomas</person> <person player="eric martin" race="UNK" position="WR">martin</person> malone has been following him the entire game when you blitz it s pretty tough to doubleteam anybody but what he does here in sort of a delayed blitz if you watch <person player="derrick thomas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">derrick thomas</person> he s number 58 he s right here he s gonna slide he s not going to come right away he s gonna wait and then he s gonna move on the <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ball</person> see how he waits the little weights a little he spy inhofe s no he sees him make the move that s where he s extremely effective in past situation <person player="derrick thomas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">thomas</person> said the difference at being at linebacker instead of defensive end you had the element of surprise and he used it on that one and he just broke art stills career record the alltime sack william for the plan child tacey jumps again let s see if they were drawn i think that one s going to be on <person player="robert jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="OT">robert jenkins</person> you saw <person player="neil smith" race="nonwhite" position="DE">neil smith</person> flinch a little but no one moved and the left tackle <person player="robert jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="OT">jenkins</person> came up just a hair quick cuz he s got a block here <person player="derrick thomas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">thomas</person> now the question will be with the new rule the defensive player cannot induce the offensive man to move by coming into the neutral zone false start offense prior to the snap number sixtyfour fiveyard penalty still third down to make he can move as long as he doesnt get himself into the neutral zone <person player="derrick thomas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">derrick thomas</person> number 58 lower right part of your screen he starts forward but not to induce the offensive lineman to reduce himself and produce a penalty in 21 <person player="jeff hostetler" race="white" position="QB">hostetler</person> throw short to <person player="tim brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">tim brown</person> this is where he is the most dangerous after the catch anderson takes him out of bounds at the kansas city portal and there s another flag down and this one s back for <person player="jeff hostetler" race="white" position="QB">hostetler</person> watch this one might go against <person player="neil smith" race="nonwhite" position="DE">neil smith</person> <person player="jeff hostetler" race="white" position="QB">hostetler</person> and prep the neck were going at it pretty good the flag is up somebody s going to get 15 after the play was over we have a personal foul on offense number 78 and a defense number 90 pin leaves are offset for offsetting personal fouls after the place of the placed and al davis obviously not pleased with that and the officials trying to keep a lid on it there you see number 78 number and number 90 little pushing and shoving that was only the beginning of it he continued long after the play fourth and eight and gossip will come on to punt <person player="danan hughes" race="UNK" position="WR">danan</person> here is waiting at the 10 for kansas city but they dont put the big rush on gossiped again goes for the corner got very close but didnt make it a 43yard punt but a net of only 23 timeout 1118 to go third quarter still seven three cans both ballclubs wearing their throwback uniforms the 1963 version and of course 1963 a tremendously significant year in the history of the los angeles raiders as out davis took over the operation of the franchise led them to such great success over the years things have been a little lean in the last few trying to get the raiders back to where they have been throughout the years <person player="kimble anders" race="UNK" position="RB">kimble anders</person> on the clock so rare carry for him and it produces nothing these teams playing each other tonight for the 68th time in this series and as a player or coach art shale has been involved in 55 of the line lately as a coach he s not done too well in fact never won here at arrowhead second and slightly more than 10 <person player="marcus allen" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marcus allen</person> checks back yet <person player="marcus allen" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marcus allen</person> running hard across the 30 and i think this will come back on a hole rob frederick s in the outside linebacker the reason there was so much space out there is somebody had a great grip on frederickson ill tell you the raider defensive line has done a great job their front seven is just shutting down everything the raiders want to do when it comes to trying to run the football holding offense number 87 penalized 10 yards repeat the bound second down tight end traci green all 282 pounds there he is right there he s gonna latch on and hold onto <person player="rob fredrickson" race="white" position="LB">rob fredrickson</person> right around his hip he comes down he s got him now he s hanging on to him hanging on to him the official the official is right on the end of the line he rides him all the way out second and 20 then <person player="mark collins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mark</person> it all the way back to the 10th gets a yard or the raiders have been tough and that was <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">jerry ball</person> all 300 plus pounds of him just standing him straight up art art shall describe the acquisition of <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">jerry ball</person> is great watch it on the right part of your screen look there s a hole oh there s a hole great guilt he says to himself i got something and then there s <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">jerry ball</person> and he s got nothing a lot of people thought <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">jerry ball</person> was washed up with a couple of injury seasons once a great ballplayer he looks like he s coming back to that for <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> slide and tried to buy some time to the 20 25 yard line still be well shy of a first down <person player="chester mcglockton" race="UNK" position="DT">chester</person> mclaughlin chased him down field and the raiders defense does its job again you always wonder what <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">joe montana</person> sees were going to show you from the goalposts camp as he goes back in the pocket he s looking at the secondary dropping back matchup man the man the linebackers are in zone nobody open has nowhere to go with the football comes back to the right kimball anders manages to do a good job to get his team in punting position and the injured player is <person player="albert lewis" race="nonwhite" position="DB">albert lewis</person> the brilliant corner who came from kansas city to the la raiders well check on his condition when we come back 9 28 to go third quarter seven three the chiefs continue to lead the raiders in a hardhitting defensive battle here at arrowhead 9 28 to go third period <person player="albert lewis" race="nonwhite" position="DB">albert lewis</person> limped off the field and that will put <person player="lionel washington" race="nonwhite" position="DB">lionel washington</person> the man he displaced in the starting lineup back out there <person player="tim brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">tim brown</person> waiting on the punt of lui a gr <person player="tim brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brown</person> up to 24 got a wall forced him to cut back in and then in there and got a piece of the tackle but a huge return 47yard and the first big play of the night for the raiders what a great job by not only the special teams punt return unit but by <person player="tim brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">tim brown</person> showing great patience to set up the blocks watch the right part of your screen he sort of cruises sets it up now he breaks out there it is the worst set watch him turning the right side no button there got great speed antioch trice knock them back inside but nobody s been bring so the leaders set up shop at the 28 yard line that wants it on the first pass incomplete contact down there with the rocket and j <person player="jay taylor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">taylor</person> but a little incidental you want the oneonone matchups where you win the long balls down the suit they would have hit the line of scrimmage see the rocket does nothing to make jake <person player="jay taylor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">taylor</person> think he s going anywhere but deep so you know jeff only puts the <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ball</person> where he can but the rocket never helped them by trying to freeze <person player="jay taylor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">taylor</person> at the line of scrimmage <person player="jeff hostetler" race="white" position="QB">hostetler</person> has missed on six of his last seven carving williams struggling for additional yardage stephanie the 21 where <person player="david whitmore" race="nonwhite" position="DB">whitmore</person> is back in the <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ball</person> game makes the stop and another injury and it s salia moa the eightyear veteran out of arizona state who has had some knee problems missed a couple of weeks and came back loosing a lot of guys go down tonight the scariest looking one was <person player="mark collins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mark collins</person> who was immobilized for a while it turned out he had a concussion salia moon number 97 right in the middle of your screen you see him go down and bent backwards looked like somebody was rolled up on the leg and he went and we will check on sally imola when we come back timeout on the field back to our head in a moment kalia mullah the big defensive tackle still down for kansas city the report on <person player="albert lewis" race="nonwhite" position="DB">albert lewis</person> he has a knee sprain his return tonight is questionable for the raiders and let s take a look at the standings in the afc west because this is a critical game for both of these teams in their effort to catch san diego the charges and stan humphries hurt coming back to the pack a little bit they lost today kansas city win tonight would get the chiefs within one game of the divisional lead if the raiders win both the chiefs and the raiders would be five and four both two games out out davis quoted earlier this week is saying this isnt over yet it s going to be a horse race somebody is coming out of the pack to challenge he left unsaid i think it s gonna be us well i think i think it s his football team i think the raiders have proven over the last four weeks that theyre as good as anybody in the afc they just defeat themselves first they had the turnover on the opening possession the interception since then they protected the <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ball</person> rather well and this has got to be a terrible sight for kansas city they saw <person player="mark collins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mark collins</person> down for a long time earlier has had a couple of other nicks and now sally emoto has been a big part of their line for a long long time he is hurt and they have some tough games coming up especially the chargers coming in here next week we dont know about the availability of humphreys for that when they have to go against the browns were also 72 then they go back to the division for a couple of games they still have to face the dolphins and it all ends up christmas eve in los angeles to play the raiders club very nice to give you a raiders game on christmas eve is no merry christmas and christmas day yeah rob waltrip who was placed inactive the rookie is a defensive tackle that they would have available but he s not so theyre really thin in the defensive line particularly a tackle where greg cragen is going to have to come in a pelham <person player="pellom mcdaniels" race="UNK" position="DE">mcdaniels</person> can play defensive tackle but they have enlisted to the most part as an end that s a look at <person player="joe phillips" race="white" position="DT">joe phillips</person> third and five biggest play of the game <person player="jeff hostetler" race="white" position="QB">hostetler</person> s ducks under pressure rid of it the sack by <person player="george jamison" race="nonwhite" position="LB">george jamison</person> the longtime detroit lions that will force a fieldgoal lot of respect for <person player="jeff hostetler" race="white" position="QB">jeff hostetler</person> s running ability right behind the post he cant hide watch <person player="george jamison" race="nonwhite" position="LB">george</person> jameson he s not going to commit to the rush he sees the back block so he s just hanging there he s mirroring jeff he s mirroring jeff he sees jeff take off he closes and makes the play jaggu boys hit 151 the score remains well be back to kansas city after this seven to three chiefs over the raiders 759 to go third quarter let s check in with <person player="mark collins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mark</person> malone mike the raiders have been dominant on the offensive line and <person player="derrick thomas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">derrick thomas</person> really hasnt been much of an impact one of the areas he s improved in is over the tight end we take a look at the video against <person player="andrew glover" race="nonwhite" position="TE">glover</person> he does his job and has some pretty good leverage on him but he never gets off the play and honey williams is up inside from 5 yards to the left side rothman coming at him gets inside and again <person player="harvey williams" race="nonwhite" position="RB">harvey williams</person> up inside <person player="derrick thomas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">derrick thomas</person> really hasnt been that impact player the guy who s constantly around the running back might bar a thank you <person player="mark collins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mark</person> kansas city s offense has done virtually nothing tonight this will be the 8th time they have had football they have four first down count up for but they also have the games only touchdown play action <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> the <person player="kimble anders" race="UNK" position="RB">kimble anders</person> out in the flat he goes absolutely no raiders have been so tough let s go back to <person player="mark collins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mark</person> mike some updated numbers right here in this spot like <person player="derrick thomas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">derrick thomas</person> the the raiders have run the <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ball</person> 22 times total ten of them at <person player="derrick thomas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">derrick thomas</person> for 43% and the word has always been in this league if you want to love the football run it at derrick because hell kill you if you run away from him mike who ns putting a word on some other great linebackers lawrence <person player="jay taylor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">taylor</person> for one of them you try to run away it just chased you down with a great speed no gain on the pass completion second and 10 takes a couple of shots together the yard line give them about four gregg beaker and <person player="winston moss" race="nonwhite" position="LB">winston moss</person> on the tack you reach points in the game mic where plays become critical not that theyre going to cause a touchdown for your a field goal position this is a very critical play for the kansas city chiefs offense tetley s give their events and blow and give them a little bit of rest theyve got to get a first down here by the time what a shoot top catch this is this when he takes right off his laces he s begging him down to tie his shoes in the <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ball</person> lands in his hand and the lower part of your screen tight end releases up the field the full bags covered underneath joe makes the throws and look at this right off the shoe top what a great catch this is the first time kansas city has taken a snap in further to make the tackle the kansas city chiefs on the right side you got the right side of the offense right there gram and ziggler theyre gonna just fire out <person player="marcus allen" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marcus</person> is going to make the play that s the power side of that line look at the hole that did create <person player="marcus allen" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marcus</person> does a great job of running after he gets in the open field broke at least two tackles on that 20 yard run they get up to the line of scrimmage in a hurry <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> throws complete to davis <person player="lionel washington" race="nonwhite" position="DB">washington</person> who s in there for albert louis makes the tackle well the offense has finally come alive for kansas city and it s coming alive because of the production of the two veterans <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">joe montana</person> and <person player="marcus allen" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marcus allen</person> second and four <person player="mark collins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mark</person> slipped as he tried to make his cut he s down at the 20 <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">jerry ball</person> covers him there the kansas city chiefs are reached in the area for their and that has created nothing but problems most teams call this the red zone inside the opponent s 20 but if your kansas city chief they call it the gold zone that was given by tim brunner their center because that s where you got to <person player="keith cash" race="nonwhite" position="TE">cash</person> in touchdowns only 47% 22nd in the national football league and tv production down inside the gold zone so at the tent gun 38 this is one thing you just dont expect from <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">joe montana</person> you can defend his arms but he s never been known as a scrambler but here he just touched it down he sees the mantoman coverage and you can see he s not real accustomed it s slidin but he still manages to get down <person player="nolan harrison" race="nonwhite" position="DE">nolan harrison</person> chased him down its first and goal at the 7 from 2010 shows incomplete excellent coverage by the radar secondary im going to show you the problem are created for the kansas city chiefs down in the red area theyll have an offense that s set up to go well against me and the man so they run a lot of angles and stuff but here look at the raiders watching to go back into zone coverage the linebackers are all going to find places to go when youve got quick posts and picks come in and look at the linebackers look at how they do all have to it here here here here here theyve got everybody covered for the kansas city chiefs <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> to <person player="marcus allen" race="nonwhite" position="RB">allen</person> gets to the four almost looked like a replay you play against the new york giants and the giants work to me the first that created those problems in our offense we had did a lot of similar things that the chiefs do and the problem was is they played a lot of zone what you have to do in the red area to going to be a red area team a good one you must run the that defeats the zone defenses make a bring the safeties inside third and goal from the for the chiefs trying to put it into their second touchdown nail as he got to about the war speaker with a big hit decision time for art show what do you do there s no question you kick the field oh that s in this kind of a football game every coin has value and they just to a flag and call procedure against kansas city mauriz schottenheimer sayin how do we get procedure we have anything lined up yeah illegal formation on the offensive team an ineligible player was on the end of the line the penalty is declined fourth down whoa i must have been on the play before because it couldnt have been on that flake no there wasnt a plane us there was no formation did i know something they had a <person player="jarrod bunch" race="UNK" position="RB">bunch</person> of guys milling around a confusing night 19 yard field goal attempt for lynn ellie my snap got a dead that s the second time a holder is done job tonight that was <person player="louie aguiar" race="white" position="P">louie aguiar</person> who went up and got it and the snap from <person player="joe valerio" race="UNK" position="C">joe valerio</person> who s centering tide from both punts and points plus <person player="danny villa" race="white" position="C">danny villa</person> is out with the back spasm so <person player="joe valerio" race="UNK" position="C">valerio</person> not only scores touchdowns but he makes the field old attempts interesting what a great job by <person player="louie aguiar" race="white" position="P">louie</person> he goes up resets it look at how he s sixth held on the ground to get out of the way of lynne elliot this is just terrific i hand coordination to make a play he did that whole thing moving that was a moving field goal that s a great play by the kick or two to be able to stop it and still get enough momentum to put it through weve seen one by each kicker this evening and it gives the chiefs a seven point lead with 246 to go third quarter seven points is huge

buccaneers barry sanders leading the nfl in rushing a thousand 82 yards this early in the scene well get to start because <person player="scott davis" race="UNK" position="DE">scott</person> mitchell broke his right hand he s a lefthanded thrower but he is out indefinitely the rocket waiting for another and gets it from the seventh slides down at the 22 dirt cupboards by kansas city specialty knee <person player="marcus allen" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marcus allen</person> getting a bleeder and the scoring drive took 5:13 off the clock by far the best drive in fact the only drive in kansas city has had tonight the key play <person player="marcus allen" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marcus allen</person> s 20yard run the other key play <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">joe montana</person> scrambled his market here s <person player="marcus allen" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marcus</person> they go over the right side we will see he does a good job of gaining seven yards after the first of his through the arms of <person player="david whitmore" race="nonwhite" position="DB">david whitmore</person> oh he had six staring him in the face the <person player="mike young" race="UNK" position="WR">young</person> man who was part of the <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">joe montana</person> train it was played so well <person player="jeff hostetler" race="white" position="QB">jeff hostetler</person> tries to get a little cute here he tries to look to the left to hold the safety and come back the <person player="tim brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">tim brown</person> once you see that look to the left he s frozen to the left now you can fat quick to the right thing but he didnt fool anybody ten rounds on the go right through and the <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ball</person> winds up on the ground <person player="joe phillips" race="white" position="DT">phillips</person> with the bear hug i dont care if the raiders do make a commitment to run the football and <person player="tim brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">tim brown</person> sooner or later they have got to try and throw the <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ball</person> downfield and get <person player="alexander wright" race="nonwhite" position="WR">alexander</person> right and james jet involved in his football game they cannot continue to do what theyre doing it s always been the trademark again for <person player="tim brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">tim brown</person> and <person player="dale carter" race="nonwhite" position="DB">dale carter</person> a we talked about the vertical game there the reception s down over 20 yards tim ground three rocket <person player="raghib ismail" race="UNK" position="WR">ismail</person> to <person player="alexander wright" race="nonwhite" position="WR">alexander</person> right james jets are speed guys with one between the two of them the chiefs make a little bit of a substitution <person player="dale carter" race="nonwhite" position="DB">dale carter</person> is now back to return the punt a high saving farther disdains the fair catch and pays for it never had a chance upon a43 the first man downfield to get the hit go back to your point if youre only going to go to <person player="harvey williams" race="nonwhite" position="RB">harvey williams</person> or <person player="tim brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">tim brown</person> it makes it a lot easier to play defense well what it allows you to do mike it has allows you to play defense because there you dont have to worry about a threat outside if you play zone defense on first and 10 it s a great one so eventually it s going to shut down your running game as well we shifted to kansas city throwing for dolphin nearly intercepted mcdaniel one of the great cover guys ran the pattern better than <person player="lake dawson" race="UNK" position="WR">lake dawson</person> did you know what i saw on that particular play i saw <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">joe montana</person> gain confidence in <person player="lake dawson" race="UNK" position="WR">lake</person> dawes method he throws the <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ball</person> up even with <person player="terry mcdaniel" race="nonwhite" position="DB">terry mcdaniel</person> there he s figuring that <person player="lake dawson" race="UNK" position="WR">lake</person> can go up and take it away from that s what makes my three and alan harper so special they make plays down to feel the chiefs less than half of their normal 57 the blitz <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> under pressure throws on the run who s made 40 tenses tonight knocked down by anderson and <person player="patrick bates" race="UNK" position="DB">bates</person> you really crushed him between him but another clutch catch for <person player="derrick walker" race="UNK" position="TE">derrick walker</person> <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">joe montana</person> s not considered a scrambler but definitely mobile he sets in the pocket here comes the pressure up the middle slides to the right makes the throw good catch big hit look like walker delivered more than he took and they are just short of the first down so be third in inches this is where i think <person player="marcus allen" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marcus allen</person> is so special just give him a little bit of a crease that he s going to find a way to get the first down marty schottenheimer says he has not begun to age as a fine wine yet sigler reports is in an eligible receiver new macphail <person player="patrick bates" race="UNK" position="DB">patrick bates</person> made the saving tackle after the gain of 12 we havent won a great job up the middle by grunts <person player="will shields" race="nonwhite" position="OG">shields</person> and dave shot right at the middle of the raider defense coming right at you right at the heart <person player="marcus allen" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marcus</person> doesnt have to look very far he s going right up the middle big hole <person player="eddie anderson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">eddie anderson</person> tries to make a play great job by that right side sixtyeight will shield s 74 derek grant nice space sir insect sack of the season the <person player="mike young" race="UNK" position="WR">young</person> man who always said just give me a chance to play everyday and ill show you that i can play the run too and he leaves the defensive line intact great quickness great speed plays laughs green plays off green now he s neutron him and makes the move on joe interesting talking to him last night says there s three things that we have to do out physical penetrate and hit the quarterback three second and seven the goodlooking rookie out of texas a&amp;m crosses midfield again rob frederickson made the tackle and that s the end of the third quarter the kansas city chiefs clinging to a sevenpoint lead after three quarters the raiders down to the chiefs by seven and it s the old folks getting it done well <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">joe montana</person> continues to be <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">joe montana</person> he s making great throws <person player="marcus allen" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marcus allen</person> picking up key first downs making great runs up the middle marty schottenheimer told us at some point in the game if the chiefs were gonna win they had to run the football that s exactly what theyre starting to do theyre starting to run the football and make place they had 82 yards of offense in that quarter only one court lead in the entire first half facing third and 12 here though the run complete but itll be short of a first down the catch made by <person player="willie davis" race="nonwhite" position="WR">willie davis</person> had sakes who would not let him get to the sticks good throw on a run now marty s got to make a decision the field goal before was a nobrainer now he s got to make a decision memory said when we had them in preseason im gonna go for fourth and ones im gonna go for fourth and ones but this is against the writers and they are going to go for it now marty wants to talk it over so the chiefs will burn a timeout on fourth and one from the 38 yard line and with the wheel changes joe we have seen so much of this this year teams deciding to go for it on fourth down the fans have cheered for decades go for it and the teams have certainly responded this year well your defense is playing good football the raiders have only scored three points that s one factor to consider the other thing is youre on the 38 yard line if you punt the <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ball</person> it goes in the end zone you wind up only nettie 18 yards and the raider defense is 25th make it 24th in the nfl are the chiefs 24th but the raiders are 25th on defense so who s got the advantage there neither one of them have been very good in that situation i say you throw a wall statistics out at this point what you do is you take a look at the way your offense is doing theyve got some momentum you dont want to take it away from them youll have to go for it this is a gut check all short yardage is mike is desire its desiring the attitude on both sides of the <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ball</person> well well find out right here who has the most on fourth and one chiefs already up ten three in <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> wanna control fort point get the first down way makes the catch ill tell you something <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">joe montana</person> knew exactly what he he tried to get everybody in the huddle before the timeout he had the play right from the beginning sprint to the right little sprint out late <person player="lake dawson" race="UNK" position="WR">dawson</person> out in the flat know exactly where you have to get to get a yard cast the first down <person player="mark collins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mark</person> and make the play they drove him back but not before his progress had before tries to cut it outside nice play by mclaughlin to get a piece of the ankle and slow up so <person player="nolan harrison" race="nonwhite" position="DE">nolan harrison</person> could rink for tackle second thing the secondhand 55 yards from <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">joe montana</person> <person player="marcus allen" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marcus allen</person> 40 yards rushing a major improvement over their first half number lady stop lights when they come the gateposts the davison it s knocked away well you just cant throw the <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ball</person> where <person player="terry mcdaniel" race="nonwhite" position="DB">terry mcdaniel</person> is going to be because youre not going to complete it he has so many different ways of covering people oneonone sometimes he bumps him at the line sometimes he plays off on this particular play he s off a little davis but he s looking at <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">joe montana</person> the break is made he closes on the <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ball</person> he figures i have as much right through it as you do but great defensive back feels i mean from the adjust superb eight <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> <person player="marcus allen" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marcus allen</person> vintage <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">joe montana</person> vintage <person player="marcus allen" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marcus allen</person> who for his entire career has been a great receiver out of the backfield but mike that play was made by <person player="kimble anders" race="UNK" position="RB">kimble</person> andrews blitz pickup here comes the air comes andy anderson watch anders come in and block him and make this play possible great job by the fullback he lets the guard take the linebacker he goes after the defensive lineman allows <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> to get the <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ball</person> off great job by the old line in back like milk checks in and hell get the carrot one yard and no more so once again the raider defense faced with the task of keeping kansas city out of the end zone trying to force another field goal the raiders did something very unusual he stay tried to flick <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">joe montana</person> when i talked to paul hackett yesterday the offensive coordinator he said we just dont see a lot of blitzing because people are afraid to come after joe that s why but our chill made the decision to go after it and paul made a good call and dumps it off and anders got to the ten yard line swarmed under there <person player="winston moss" race="nonwhite" position="LB">winston</person> lawson <person player="patrick bates" race="UNK" position="DB">patrick</person> pace and rebates this isnt this is a very interesting situation for the chiefs and so that if they do get five yards in the first down it can probably burn another four minutes off the clock if they want to try and drive this fight through the waivers hart they can go into the end zone and try and get touched on third and five <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> under pressure throws incomplete but there s a flag down <person player="anthony smith" race="nonwhite" position="DE">anthony smith</person> got to <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> in a hurry couldnt get set to throw the penalty flag would be against kansas city but obviously they would turn that down and bring up a fourth down you think so holding offense number 66 penalty is declined fourth down <person player="ricky siglar" race="nonwhite" position="OT">ricky</person> ziggler the right tackle derick <person player="derrick graham" race="nonwhite" position="OG">graham</person> started there but moved over to left tackle and <person player="john alt" race="nonwhite" position="OT">john alt</person> went out of the ballgame kansas city came into this game with 21 holding penalties the secondmost in the nfl got another one there this will be a 27 yard attempt by <person player="lin elliott" race="white" position="K">lin elliott</person> to put his team up by 10 and it s good so twice kansas city has threatened to get touchdowns deep and raider territory theyve had to settle for field goals but they lead by ten espn s sunday night nfl is brought to you by sylvan 100% cotton no wrinkle clothing buy the new passat br6 and by taco bell featuring the fully loaded sevenlayer burrito 11 minutes 13 seconds to go in the ballgame 13 3 the chiefs and 11 13 may sound like a long time but it s not the way these offenses in london i long time to get anywhere line drive kick for the rocket to the 26yard line horse collard there <person player="danan hughes" race="UNK" position="WR">danan hughes</person> downfield ziegler gets called for holding <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> gets knocked on the ground and alex gives the offensive line coach is letting the offensive line know that theyve got to do a better job in particular theyre giving it to <person player="ricky siglar" race="nonwhite" position="OT">ricky</person> ziegler and saying youve just got to get it done with all that of the game theyve gotta count on him to make plays in the offensive line the raiders offense has got to produce they need to scores in the last 11:05 <person player="jeff hostetler" race="white" position="QB">hostetler</person> s short to cover simian in on the stop along with <person player="doug terry" race="UNK" position="DB">doug terry</person> and <person player="derrick thomas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">derrick thomas</person> also over there gain of only five the raiders with 15 <person player="harvey williams" race="nonwhite" position="RB">harvey</person> william dance us outside got away from <person player="dale carter" race="nonwhite" position="DB">carter</person> enough for a first down out of bounds the 39 <person player="harvey williams" race="nonwhite" position="RB">harvey</person> winds may have popped off a lot coming in saying how much he was looking forward to playing his former teammate he s backed it up with his performance but they both doesnt have i think the kansas city chief defense has done an excellent job and <person player="harvey williams" race="nonwhite" position="RB">harvey williams</person> has certainly backed up everything he said like you mentioned like 24 carries nine <person player="jeff hostetler" race="white" position="QB">hostetler</person> nowhere to go with it incomplete eventually intended for <person player="tim brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">tim brown</person> and <person player="dale carter" race="nonwhite" position="DB">dale carter</person> shaking his head saying no sir not on me good job by the offensive line they are given hostile lot of time but <person player="george jamison" race="nonwhite" position="LB">george</person> jameson number 57 right here watch what he does on this play he is not committing he has <person player="jeff hostetler" race="white" position="QB">jeff hostetler</person> he is the spy past edler slide slides to keep good runs for the first down but there s jameson right in front of them forced him to throw the football excellent defense and <person player="dale carter" race="nonwhite" position="DB">dale carter</person> with great coverage he s had it all shortening completely right over the head of <person player="harvey williams" race="nonwhite" position="RB">harvey williams</person> that darrin mikkel was right in his face so he just hasnt been able to find anybody a lot of credit to that defensive secondary theyve done an excellent job look at it this way mike when you throw the <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ball</person> to <person player="tim brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">tim brown</person> how many people you have to defend out there exact they like i said theyve got to put the <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ball</person> on third down and ten but on first down us ive got it other people <person player="jeff hostetler" race="white" position="QB">hostetler</person> rolling now 22 an interception he s been sacked three times now he faces third and 10 time to throw again and completes us from the <person player="tim brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brown</person> <person player="eddie anderson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">eddie</person> bob more than a first down at the 49yard and for one of the few times kim <person player="tim brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brown</person> had a <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ball</person> on his hands and couldnt hold it you have a dip tail <person player="dale carter" race="nonwhite" position="DB">carter</person> an awful lot of credit he timed this hit absolutely perfect <person player="dale carter" race="nonwhite" position="DB">carter</person> s backing off theyre in a zone theyre playing a soft zone he slides back <person player="tim brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brown</person> does a nice stutter step accelerates out excellent throw but just as he s in the air he knocks it away from him so the balls on his chest he loses it the raiders will have to punt away low line drive gets the bounce <person player="danan hughes" race="UNK" position="WR">hughes</person> picks it up at the thwart cuts it back got out to the 25yard line <person player="wes bender" race="UNK" position="RB">wes bender</person> made the tackle or he might have gone another 30 well be back to kansas city right after this 133 chiefs be two left in the game weve seen where people have run tonight weve seen where <person player="jeff hostetler" race="white" position="QB">jeff hostetler</person> is throwing the <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ball</person> let s take a look at where <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">joe montana</person> s thrown it tonight <person player="gerald perry" race="nonwhite" position="OT">perry</person> has that little receiver makes a great catch here they are running back 10 up 11 hed only expect 58 yards tied in these are the big ones right there he s throwing to the wide receivers sparingly because that the raiders have got such great corners may as well stay away and derek walker s done a heck of a job of keep sideline and wide for <person player="lake dawson" race="UNK" position="WR">lake dawson</person> <person player="lake dawson" race="UNK" position="WR">dawson</person> playing tonight getting to start because <person player="jj birden" race="UNK" position="WR">jj</person> burton has some crack bones in his lower back and maybe out a couple of more weeks that <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ball</person> just absolutely slipped at a joe s hand just squirted right out high hard and away kansas city s biggest ally right now is the clock with 9:28 ago and the raiders down to scores trying to get outside and cant frederickson makes the big tackle and now <person player="lionel washington" race="nonwhite" position="DB">washington</person> and <person player="lake dawson" race="UNK" position="WR">dawson</person> are hooked up i think if im having a real problem with the consistency of the flags there was a case where <person player="lionel washington" race="nonwhite" position="DB">lionel washington</person> threw a punch and there wasnt a flag method not that you can you know feel eyes where we want but theyve had offsetting penalties before with flags now they dont have one this is the raiders in chiefs i guess <person player="lake dawson" race="UNK" position="WR">dawson</person> walks up with <person player="lionel washington" race="nonwhite" position="DB">washington</person> trying to do a job lock him he grabs his facemask nothing happened so damn <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> throws income contact on the plane no flag <person player="lake dawson" race="UNK" position="WR">lake</person> khasan again covered by mcdaniel perfectly man if there s a better corner in the lead theyre separated by very thin margins let me tell you will you watch mcdaniel and darryl <person player="tracy greene" race="UNK" position="TE">greene</person> <person player="eric martin" race="UNK" position="WR">eric</person> <person player="marcus allen" race="nonwhite" position="RB">allen</person> yes sir guys like that who were just incredible defensive back <person player="tim brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brown</person> weights at the 35 this is the seven fun for kansas city the part on that possession anke art it s another gorgeous shot 2:22 returns just across the 39 yards after a 52yard effort from a gr8 48 left the writers need something on us eight 48 left to kansas city defense has held the raiders to three points and lead by 10 in a game that would move who that was in one game of the lead in the afc west greater offense it s been a twoman show the rest of the team of 23 total yards williams on the receiving end of that one out to the 34 this is a must drive for the raiders theyve got to get something over here whether it be a field going for a touchdown theyve got to get in position to put some points on the board with 8:30 left in the game second and seven <person player="jeff hostetler" race="white" position="QB">hostetler</person> <person player="harvey williams" race="nonwhite" position="RB">harvey williams</person> again same thing shortgame falls down on the catch picks up another three kansas city chiefs figured it out well if the raiders werent a throw short well let him throw short there they are 1 2 3 4 they created umbrella they make them throw out here in the flat that s exactly what s happening theyre taking away the deep stuff taking away the middle making them throw 4 yard gases to the flat 3rd and 4 were in trouble <person player="neil smith" race="nonwhite" position="DE">neil smith</person> wrapped him up and then got help from sally amore most of the night <person player="jeff hostetler" race="white" position="QB">hostetler</person> has had a lot of time to throw and still hasnt been able to find people sometimes a receiver becomes a crutch mike in this case <person player="tim brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">tim brown</person> comes in they know they need remember they hit that short cast before there he is he freezes <person player="jeff hostetler" race="white" position="QB">hostetler</person> s hanging hanging hanging with them sorry <person player="neil smith" race="nonwhite" position="DE">neil smith</person> just keeps on coming just tosses skeptic aside so theyll have to pull it away with 7:18 to go in the ballgame wobbly kick and <person player="danan hughes" race="UNK" position="WR">hughes</person> makes a good decision lets it bounce and it will die at the 25yard line 44yard punt no return still a 10point lead city chiefs are seven minutes and six seconds away of crawling will didnt one game of the san diego chargers they would raise their record to six and three and marty schottenheimer would continue his dominance over the raiders especially here at arrowhead tough night to <person player="jeff hostetler" race="white" position="QB">jeff hostetler</person> the offense in the second half only twenty nine yards two first downs and now if kansas city throws the <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ball</person> on this possession im going to be it s about three interesting with garrett hill carrying the football paul hackett the offensive coordinator of the kansas city chiefs in a meeting this week told his <person player="mike young" race="UNK" position="WR">young</person> guys <person player="lake dawson" race="UNK" position="WR">lake dawson</person> <person player="greg

its way towards six minutes it is a 10point kansas city lead the raiders that they lose this game would fall to four and five after scratching their way back to 500 third and four and now <person

position="DB">eddie anderson</person> the free safety was on the coverage that time the key for quarterbacks mike is to read to create a passing lane on this particular play looking with the offensive line to see that out to the right right there <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> has a place to throw the football he s got a lane right through the middle there

penalty marker down and it will go against the raiders holding offense number 76 10yard cuddly repeat the down first down that steve was dusky has gone to four straight pulp throw balls just a tremendous offensive dart flag for holding on that one 11 penalties against the raiders 85 yards the chiefs have been hit with 4/4 rohtak the raiders in second place in penalties trying to catch him i think they have first in 20 after the holy call and movement along the offensive line scrappin act jumped early you know it s interesting my i think that s the third authentic to get the first down that s the 12th penalty called against the raiders at least accepted theyve been a couple more that have either been offsetting or not taken now davis s expression says it all first in 25 the raiders are going the wrong direction big rush screen des williams &amp; williams falls down ed may have cost him 10 15 yards have blockers in front good call against the pig wash excellent call they had the zone set up they got some people out in front of it <person player="harvey williams" race="nonwhite" position="RB">harvey</person> just slip second in 20 to look at the clock 427 left hostile aliens in the flat that that s out of bounds <person player="jay taylor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jay taylor</person> makes the tackle <person player="harvey williams" race="nonwhite" position="RB">harvey williams</person> and <person player="tim brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">tim brown</person> i cant even say theyve been the primary targets for <person player="jeff hostetler" race="white" position="QB">jeff hostetler</person> tonight they are the only ones except for one cast shown dance mistake part of the getting the chant from the kansas city crowd it s third and 17 they cant go with the short stuff here one of your time for <person player="jeff hostetler" race="white" position="QB">hostetler</person> there s <person player="tim brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">tim brown</person> and hands the first down at the kansas city 37 <person player="george jamison" race="nonwhite" position="LB">george jamison</person> made the tackle well that s you know <person player="jeff hostetler" race="white" position="QB">hostetler</person> and <person player="tim brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brown</person> must be pretty good if everybody knows where it s going and they still get it that is just a bad bad execution by a defense you know where <person player="tim brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">tim brown</person> is late in the middle of the football field there is nobody in the middle of the football field accepts going to be tim ground <person player="jeff hostetler" race="white" position="QB">hostetler</person> duck lover to the 13 yard line and there s a flag down on this one a gain of 23 will it stand 13 penalties 95 yards well you just cant have that no you cant keep going back but now when you make it big plays at a crucial time of the game illegal too many women same time friday with snap fiveyard penalty repeat the down first stop turns out to be a 28 yard penalty because they lose the game than another five for the illegal motion and not only that mike it was a different type of a look a different formation if something you put in your playbook to get a good play that now has been totally wasted because they didnt execute first and 15 <person player="calvin jones" race="UNK" position="RB">calvin jones</person> texan and hell get the catch and gets out of bounce 38 yard line the first reception of the year for the third round draft choice from nebraska and in <person player="harvey williams" race="nonwhite" position="RB">harvey williams</person> on the sideline 93 yards yes for 28 yards receiving he s had a heck of a night so why is he on the sidelines with the sereth hertz team picked up needs a little rest hey he risked a lot three minutes and 13 seconds <person player="jeff hostetler" race="white" position="QB">hostetler</person> completes this one dick plumper and blubber is very close to having another first down at the 26 <person player="tracy rogers" race="UNK" position="LB">tracy rogers</person> begs to tackle well kansas city will give them a lot of the short stuff because it s really eating up the time and now the raiders trying to go hurry up in kansas city trying to get his players off the field and now the chiefs will call a timeout they did not have the defense set that s a good timeout for kansas city and all right theyre not going to need bears at the end like the raiders are let s go to bart malone on the sidelines <person player="mark collins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mark</person> well mike weve just about chronicled everything that <person player="derrick thomas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">derrick thomas</person> has done tonight but the one thing we havent talked about is whose pass coverage let s take a look at the impact he has when he drops into pass coverage here he gets underneath the hook against <person player="alexander wright" race="nonwhite" position="WR">alexander wright</person> takes away the hook forces <person player="jeff hostetler" race="white" position="QB">hostetler</person> back late and almost cost us the near interception by <person player="david whitmore" race="nonwhite" position="DB">whitmore</person> but the most important fact that he s been in this <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ball</person> game so far as the tt meanies it s taken people out of the pass routes joe and that might be why <person player="jeff hostetler" race="white" position="QB">hostetler</person> hasnt been able to throw the football downfield the facts or to <person player="andrew glover" race="nonwhite" position="TE">glover</person> until recently when <person player="derrick thomas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">derrick thomas</person> was back in coverage mike joe what do you think of that i ride on it i think <person player="mark collins" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mark</person> hits it absolutely right he has such a profound effect on other elements of the game with two people being committed to block him you take out an entire back out of the backfield which is taking away underneath coverage and allowing the deeper passes to be complete first attended with 246 to go on the game raiders down by 10 points they need a touchdown on a field goal here comes the blitz <person player="jeff hostetler" race="white" position="QB">hostetler</person> tries to throw the <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ball</person> comes loose and the raiders head excuse me kansas city got it it looked like rathmann fell on it kansas city football and that could ended one of the rare times that the chiefs have decided to go after <person player="jeff hostetler" race="white" position="QB">hostetler</person> which is coming right up the middle it comes tracy simeon and they just really collapsed the pocket and allow smith to come around on the outside and just grab jeff s arm <person player="neil smith" race="nonwhite" position="DE">neil smith</person> coming hard around the corner just us flick the <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ball</person> away and now kansas city totally in the driver s seat fights him <person player="marcus allen" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marcus allen</person> trying to get outside goes down to one knee then gets back up but he s down there s a 28 yard line <person player="lionel washington" race="nonwhite" position="DB">lionel washington</person> makes this stop and the raiders will stop the clock they will have two timeouts left and obviously they have made their decision there you try to use them here on this possession to save as much time as possible so constantly with the fumble after an intersection on the first play of the ballgame it has not been a good night for them and this is <person player="marcus allen" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marcus allen</person> limping off after that last play where he s tackled this will get <person player="greg hill" race="UNK" position="RB">greg hill</person> back in the <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ball</person> game <person player="marcus allen" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marcus</person> takes it up inside sees everybody there <person player="lionel washington" race="nonwhite" position="DB">washington</person> comes up just as friend he just advantages to plant his foot in such a manner that it creates a problem and he takes off and tries to run and slips again here s the reverse angle right there when he jams his left foot in to try and make some kind of a cut and keep his feet just keeps on going raiders were trying to strip the <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ball</person> there s great hill features frozen down at the 25 and the raiders will call their second timeout and one of the raider players is down after that for <person player="winston moss" race="nonwhite" position="LB">winston moss</person> the injured player where s coming up after our broadcast is sportscenter dan <person player="patrick bates" race="UNK" position="DB">patrick</person> and <person player="keith cash" race="nonwhite" position="TE">keith</person> over limited standing by for that get you caught up on everything in the day of sports of course well look back at foreman and more the remarkable outcome of that the wrapup of the nfl and our sunday night conversation is with <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">joe montana</person> and then prime time with <person player="chris penn" race="UNK" position="WR">chris</person> berman tom jackson and <person player="robert jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="OT">robert</person> roberts the complete wrapup of today s action in the nfl and some shockers around the league today congratulations to dave shula and the cincinnati bengals they got off the schneid beat the seahawks today got the win in overtime third and 16 for kansas city what definitely gets to the 31 by greg beaker and the raiders i think im going to take the tournament warning time out and save one here six on the flight and that s exactly what theyll do theyll let the clock run down to two minutes and preserve a single timeout so we reach the twobit award in kansas city in permit 133 two minutes left in the game the chiefs bite an over the writers from arrowhead and a delighted 78,000 sellout crowd has watched marty schottenheimer hz defense do the job in their three losses they only had one takeaway in their five wins they had 19 tonight they had two and as you go around the league it never seems to change you take the <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ball</person> away from the other guy you win yeah and if you get it if you get around to it s just about even <person player="jeff hostetler" race="white" position="QB">hostetler</person> hoping for two miracles here in the last two minutes gr has never had a punt block in his career and this one will roll dead at the 34 the clock will run until somebody touches that <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ball</person> low and the chiefs doing a great job of surrounding the football and letting another 5 or 6 seconds tick off the clock they ran 14 seconds off the clock on a punt on a punt that s a pretty headsup football so now the raiders with an unenviable task especially since their offenses produce very little all night long now you really got to try and get a touchdown and youve got to give it up so that you can at least get yourself maybe an onside kicking an opportunity for a shot of the field goal i would look for him to put the bar right in the middle jettison the ballgame he s <person player="jeff hostetler" race="white" position="QB">hostetler</person> dumps it off the william williams gets a block picks up about 10 yards after the 44 the other thing that the raiders have to be conscious of is they have to be conscious of trying to get to the sidelines and stop the car cutting back into the middle of the football field plays right into what the chiefs wanted to do absolutely and there was a flag down in the secondary discussing the options with <person player="jeff hostetler" race="white" position="QB">hostetler</person> illegal contact defense number 44 five yards automatic first down so they give up about four yards on the game to get the automatic first down that doesnt make any sense job the way they get you need every inch you can get you need every second you can get you need to go for on fourth down anyway sure now only a minute 30 left <person player="derrick thomas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">thomas</person> d smith getting set to saddle up and <person player="jeff hostetler" race="white" position="QB">hostetler</person> throws on the was all over ken <person player="tim brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brown</person> and the <person player="jeff hostetler" race="white" position="QB">jeff hostetler</person> does a good job of hanging in the pocket marty schottenheimer trying to tell his guys dont worry about arguing just get back and get set because theyre in a hurry up offense illegal contact defense number 34 five yards first down how would that not be interference since the <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ball</person> was right there how would there be no time running off the clock still a minute son did absol the clock tip youre right joey did not <person player="jeff hostetler" race="white" position="QB">hostetler</person> the bomb the rocket all <person player="jeff hostetler" race="white" position="QB">hostetler</person> has to do is hang this thing out and he s got six the rocket had him beat but the pass was underthrown an anderson got there just in time give a lot of credit though to that front floor they put pressure on hassan he wasnt able to step in this <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ball</person> just hangs in the air and winds up hitting the anderson right in the top of the head <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ball</person> comes in does it anderson does a nice job of trying to catch up to it the rocket just couldnt wait for it any longer and you wonder how do you let a guy beat you deeply you know that je taime <person player="jeff hostetler" race="white" position="QB">hostetler</person> over the minute picked off vitamin c there s a flag down in mincing not that amounts to 48 yardline now let s check the penalty what a wild game im going to go out on a limb im going to say it s illegal contact im going to say there are people who have hit sitcoms that are on camera as much as dick hand this is unbelievable i mean the kansas city chief defense is taking it as an opportunity to play the contact was legal so no penalty and it s a huge call against the raiders and for the chiefs and <person player="jeff hostetler" race="white" position="QB">jeff hostetler</person> wants to know what the why why is it official throwing the flag if the contact was legal good point what did he have a second chance to think about it i mean your eyes tell you something i never understand that when they throw a flag and pick it up and say that well it didnt really happen but it didnt happen why did you throw the flag the only thing i can surmise is that another official came in and said well it wasnt 16 straight wins when they forced three or more turnovers that was their third all the chiefs have to do is kill the clock the raters can only stop at once and fred biletnikoff is getting his two cents worth theyre talking about half and there s another flag down and this may be on the raiders bench i well i think i think fred biletnikoff is looking for an explanation as to how you can throw a flag and not have it happen i think he put it in a little bit stronger terms because he got a pen i think he may have but no explanation as to the call again but fred is the likely culprit and now <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> kneels down well mike <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">joe montana</person> continues on his streak he was 13 and 1 when he threw a touchdown pass prior to this game tonight he s now 14 and 1 when he throws a touchdown pass the raiders took their last timeout with 108 to go <person player="marcus allen" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marcus allen</person> at a critical 20 yard run and a critical last play for him in this game because they do have the chargers coming in next week he went down twisted his ankle question is how much will that affect him as he prepares this week for the charges the numbers on <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> nothing to write home about but certainly he authored the only big offensive play for kansas city in his 57 yard touchdown pass to <person player="derrick walker" race="UNK" position="TE">derrick walker</person> in the first half sportscenter force follows our broadcast a bittersweet return to kansas city for <person player="harvey williams" race="nonwhite" position="RB">harvey williams</person> he played very well but his raiders are going to go out the score remember my cartel told us last night that every one of these games has boiled down to the raiders making mistakes that have hurt them that s exactly what happened with the score at seven three in the third quarter after big punt return of 47 yards the raiders had the <person player="jerry ball" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ball</person> in kansas city s 27 yard line run three plays gain one yard and missed a field goal and <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> with the kneel down and have to do it one more time schottenheimer against the afc west through tonight nine and two against post seattle narrators eight three against san diego the only losing record to that curse at john elway who has bedeviled in his entire career whether he has been in cleveland or kansas city we asked him the other night didnt that win in denver wasnt that really special to you i mean let s let s get serious these know it s just another step in trying to get where we are now hell eventually look back at that and say boy that was some night and <person player="joe montana" race="white" position="QB">montana</person> takes a knee and that s it a bitterly fought ballgame between these two clubs and kansas city will come out with a 133 when boy it was a defensive battle it was a defensive battle when the chief started to run the football they took control of the game the raiders had their opportunities and they got away from but ill tell you something were looking at a great <person player="mike young"
