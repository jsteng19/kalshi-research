claiming this entire season with <person player="graham harrell" race="UNK" position="QB">harrell</person> and they find space and it s not a good sign their protect the texas see number five hobbling off <person player="baron batch" race="UNK" position="RB">baron</person> thatch circles ours are running back as an extra steveo wide open down the middle to the 41 yard line and he connects with romain swindle they will find themes if you present them and this time see how to linebackers <person player="baron batch" race="UNK" position="RB">baron</person> back it opened up a ninth boyd in the back end of that zone and again the experience of<person player="graham harrell" race="UNK" position="QB">graham harrell</person>recognizing and putting the ball right we have to pitch remains wendell working our <person player="michael crabtree" race="nonwhite" position="WR">crabtree</person> s left leg or a part of that leg first down and 10 and they come back with a running play with <person player="shannon woods" race="UNK" position="RB">woods</person> his second carry this is one thing currently that coach leach has added to the offense they are running the ball mack brown telling us look theyre running the ball better than they have i think it s the best running game that he s had since he s been in lubbock and i asked him and we talked to him this week we said why why this year why are you running the ball more he said well we have got two great backs and a big strong physical offensive line they averaged 139 yards this year on the ground which is the best he s ever had book strike again <person player="detron lewis" race="UNK" position="WR">detron</person> <person player="louis vasquez" race="UNK" position="OL">louis</person> s first catch of the night dec 15 and sir with will muschamp here early at least their attempt had an answer to try to come after<person player="graham harrell" race="UNK" position="QB">graham harrell</person>is every single snap youre seeing a different look the linebackers are up showing pressure the snap they drop the next play theyre sitting back to the outside they blitz to the inside theyre trying to create from havoc and some pressure on this veteran texas tech offensive line and so far gram heroin company had handled it reserves second third down on this opening drive from the horn 35 yard line need four down he goes sack for the first time wrapped up by <person player="roy miller" race="UNK" position="DL">miller</person> roy and <person player="roy miller" race="UNK" position="DL">miller</person> with the game s first sack and remember now that <person player="graham harrell" race="UNK" position="QB">harrell</person> has been sacked only three times everybody talks about texas and they think about a rack bo and kendall on the outside this gives you the idea the importance of having a push in the middle and<person player="roy miller" race="UNK" position="DL">roy miller</person>it s more than capable of doing that that will be very important tonight protected the defense before seeing a rare texas tech coming liqueur with juan <person player="quan cosby" race="nonwhite" position="WR">cosby</person> not deep for the horns so the red raiders failed to score on their first possession and now they down at hunt and koch lacroix will have to go the distance 99 yards awaits the man everyone believes is the frontrunner right now for the heisman trophy he s about to be tested in the lovin all fired up no easiest part of the stadium koch <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">mccoy</person> must operate in the shadow of his to that fine point of power i formation conservative and hands on safety a safety on the first hand off of the game<person player="colby whitlock" race="UNK" position="DL">colby whitlock</person>the nose man is it on chris ho benaiah and it s two nothing rit raiders that s one way to get this crowd back into the game after being forced to punt offensively just a push here by win lock and watch him just watch the defensive line just overpower texas up front<person player="richard jones" race="UNK" position="DL">richard jones</person>getting a push <person player="colby whitlock" race="UNK" position="DL">whitlock</person> open i didnt have a chance by the time he had to football oh he can fear black jerseys breaking face these guys have been hearing for over a year that they cant play any defense theyve been waiting all year for something like this cause the horns will kick it away from the 20yard line red raiders will have the ball after the safety guns were up at the neck safety in this stadium slave like that madeline give you the points but change to momentum in a big way it looked like a block punt for block field goal john goal will punt it away koch <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">mccoy</person> s on the head taught me to <person player="greg smith" race="UNK" position="TE">greg</person> davis up in the booth bobbled on the 35yard line and so<person player="graham harrell" race="UNK" position="QB">graham harrell</person>comes out krispin iiters <person player="michael crabtree" race="nonwhite" position="WR">crabtree</person> returning to the game after you saw them tape that ankle up down below im sorry i was going to say about<person player="graham harrell" race="UNK" position="QB">graham harrell</person>starting at 35th game protect the second the reason that s important is yes all the way back to kliff kingsbury for mike leagues to have a veteran quarterback and i think that has a lot to do with why this offense is hitting on all cylinders coming into the night s game darryl is back in the gun which is the running back belong to the right here comes <person player="shannon woods" race="UNK" position="RB">woods</person> is third carry from scrimmage am now lisa what did you find out about <person player="michael crabtree" race="nonwhite" position="WR">crabtree</person> s injury well <person player="brent nickerson" race="UNK" position="DB">brent</person> like you said they were working on his left ankle and i spoke to head trainer steve pincott and he said it s the same ankle that s who s been bothered with over the last couple of games like you said they paint it up a game of tumblr pills dont know what those skills were but they said he s fine what they want him to do is keep talking to them the training staff so they can monitor how he feels throughout the game the longhorns have been very successful against some very talented receivers the last couple of weeks and certainly theyll have their eye on number five second batman v <person player="graham harrell" race="UNK" position="QB">harrell</person> steps off to the right and throws complete for the first down he hits lewis you can see a lot of these kind of look for this office tonight harold feels the pressure but theyre going to pick on beasley the corner he has to make a decision he comes up again on the receiver that s out in the flat giving a nice big window for <person player="graham harrell" race="UNK" position="QB">graham</person> heroin one peril was able to get away from the pressure a very easy throw for him for a big game will must chance defense under fire there s that inside shuttle pass the horns view that basically as a run and that is <person player="baron batch" race="UNK" position="RB">batch</person> number 25 volt carrier on and so will muschamp has to change up consistently not face the passing attack quite like this you give up some numbers in this conference when you face these kind of quarterbacks and these kind of offenses but the key is being able to make plays when you have to to be able to either prevent a touchdown and force a field goal or be able to come up with a big turnover trying to get through that wide gaps in pursuit apparel on the move right and a timing reception at the 30yard line <person player="michael crabtree" race="nonwhite" position="WR">crabtree</person> making the grab and the chains move again another great example of<person player="michael crabtree" race="nonwhite" position="WR">michael crabtree</person>working back to find<person player="graham harrell" race="UNK" position="QB">graham harrell</person>graham harold s going to scramble he s going downfield to clear out as though he realized his quarterbacks in trouble and help out the hands by number five to be able to pull that ball in what a great look at pratt free bracketed he took the corner banged into him and with those great big hands of his snares it now <person player="michael crabtree" race="nonwhite" position="WR">crabtree</person> come out of the backfield if you want to circle to the left <person player="graham harrell" race="UNK" position="QB">harrell</person> cant find him open right away so he moves to the right itll be second down you touched on i said a little earlier about the importance of mixing up looks when you have a veteran quarterback like<person player="graham harrell" race="UNK" position="QB">graham harrell</person>again it s every every week in this conference youre talking about a quarterback that s starting it is almost a third year or fourth years and starting quarterback when you have that kind of experience it s like having a coach back there looking into these eyes of this defensive it goes up it is like having a coach because he is son of a coach played for his daddy over in ennis texas which is not too far from dallas texas and mike leach swears by his decisionmaking that time he almost made a mistake with<person player="aaron williams" race="UNK" position="DB">aaron williams</person>closing him and erecto coming off that line now the one thing to remember about the defensive linemen in a game like this not sure muschamp and everybody on that defensive staff know this when you pursue a quarterback as often as they do you get to the fourth quarter your tongue is hanging when they throw as many trains as they throw it s another reason that you get fatigued that s like depth and rope rotating body then it s so important when youre trying to defend these types of offenses and the big third down here muschamp trying to overload the front tries to get to harold does not battery again rips away to the 12yard off the size of the hand and the strength of number five this is called a back shoulder fade this is designed to throw back to the back side he s actually doing this on purpose it makes it so hard for beasley who thinks he s going downfield but the ball is thrown back behind the receiver and be quite an advantage for the receiver knowing the ball will be thrown there it s all about the timing again between heroing <person player="michael crabtree" race="nonwhite" position="WR">crabtree</person> remember now this drivers setup by the safety i came on third in ten already <person player="michael crabtree" race="nonwhite" position="WR">crabtree</person> with three receptions here tonight back to the running game with number two <person player="shannon woods" race="UNK" position="RB">woods</person> beasley you have a busy night if theyre going to keep coming at him okay okay he can say coach i need a little more help over here but throwing at me theyre running at me this drive is which is a great example of texas tech and how they can attack you in different ways well see if theyre able to finish off this drive that s been at the key tonight can these offenses for when they get into the red zone and not have to settle for field goals steps away from the pressure still waiting wow incomplete and he had a touchdown and <person player="edward britton" race="UNK" position="WR">britton</person> who had a big game last year in austin couldnt hang on<person player="graham harrell" race="UNK" position="QB">graham harrell</person>showing the<person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt mccoy</person>is not the only quarterback who s somewhat nifty in the pocket gets away from that show and then lewis dives now he s got all kinds of time throwing way back all the way into the middle of the field which is a nono but he s got his man there <person player="edward britton" race="UNK" position="WR">britton</person> just unable to hold on to it that s checks into the backfield now weve got third and 10 you know the horns will be looking for number five theyre well off the line theyre going to try to flit off they get there they cannot off the back foot incompleted he was going for number five they put pressure on in that time they hurried harold and will muschamp would tell you that that s as good as it s at even if you put pressure on him and it forces him to maybe throw it before he s ready that s as good as a sack especially on third down here s a big story young<person player="matt williams" race="UNK" position="K">matt williams</person>who was 9 for 9 as a walkon it wasnt really a walkon coach sent somebody in the stands to giddy after he came out and hit that 30 yarder to earn a year s free rent over at the linwood condominiums players dont even know him he s williams he s simply lindley here it is folks his first field goal within 29 yards who rips it total how about this young man one of the stories of the year in college football but now i hear the longhorns youre saying okay settle it we gave up a safety but a whole field goal that s a victory for the horde out there saturday night football on abc wont you buy southwest airlines low fares no

put the chorus first pass of the night and why not it comes in having completed 82% how about the impact guys go well and cope a boy has an arsenal of weapons weve seen on these last three weeks threat last three weeks <person player="jordan shipley" race="UNK" position="WR">jordan</person> ship leaves on fire 34 reception to get the last three weeks<person player="quan cosby" race="nonwhite" position="WR">quan cosby</person>on the other side unique ways of trying to get him the football you just saw that keep an eye on ight on five feet whitaker he s been banged up he will be in the game as the game goes on and on the astroturf with his speed he could be a factor second down and three inside scylla pass open eyes short of the first down on their first series on the first play as we see <person player="quan cosby" race="nonwhite" position="WR">cosby</person> who caught that pass took a lick hardhitting game time at coppa koi in the last three weeks against oklahoma and of course missouri and oklahoma state how many times did we team texas answered when theyve been challenged let s see if they can do it again on the road the tough environment can they answer being down by five third and one and they run over nyah and it s going to be close tried to stick his helmet across that yellow line which indicates first down but theyre not getting the spot there<person player="richard jones" race="UNK" position="DL">richard jones</person>and<person player="brian duncan" race="UNK" position="LB">brian duncan</person>duncan number 57 is a very talented linebacker somebody needs to get down in the huddle for the texas team and talk to the offensive line because these first four snaps big advantage for texas tech with the intensity and battling up at the line of scrimmage anette when a year ago in austin 59:43<person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt mccoy</person>rushed for 51 yards as we take a look at this inches away and here we come mack brown told us this week of all the teams that he plays in a big 12 against texas tech because possessions are so key he will take more calculated risk against mike leach go against the norm it wasnt the importance of holding on to the football and scoring points here s the first one and it s big <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">mccoy</person> himself remember he got 51 he gets stood up he gets put up but he may get the spot they may indeed get the spot forward progress or being indicated there by the line judge and what do you think generous wack if im mike leach at the very least by my request another look at this it didnt look like texas moved forward at all it looked like maybe picks up on a foot and a half there maybe to get the first down but again texas tech mean business up front tonight i thought there was a early surge kirk in which <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">mccoy</person> moved toward that first down and then it gets thrown back leather clothes take a second look right there how he gets pushed back yeah it mean were there s a great look at it right here it s closed obviously i dont know if it s going to be able to be changed just based on the slide but at the end of the day my point is texas tech up front right now is attacking texas is all offensive line play fake and complete should have been handled by<person player="greg smith" race="UNK" position="TE">greg smith</person>even though it was a touch high most teams during the vocaloids streak of completing so many passes have decided to attack in a blitz in quite a bit now texas back their reputation is a bin but dont break defense they would rather play zone make you execute all the way down the field and then get into the red zone and see if you can execute and put it touchdown on the board the ruffin mcneil kirk took over as a defensive coordinator after nine games last year he s been trying to bring the heat here tonight second down and ten rushed only three that time and you could not a fumble their rule of incomplete didnt have it long enough <person player="dan buckner" race="UNK" position="WR">buckner</person> was antenna receiver rushing three dropping eight defeat both the defense is playing a bit of a cat mouse game with the different look this is the area is vomited never have control there have possession this is the area where<person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt mccoy</person>is attacked the most inside the area where the linebacker bennett hosteria with <person player="jordan shipley" race="UNK" position="WR">shipley</person> and these other receivers that time them unable to hold on to him third and then prior to the snap prior to the snap delay a game often five girly fill third down the longhorns are rattled early now mack brown and the coaches are going to have to settle them down to get them in this rhythm there s no question theyre just a little bit off stride here then i go deep got a man open simply cant hold on folks theyre not executing for three straight weeks they execute in one play after another and coke liqueur ii took another link they get fresh runkle koi takes a little time for this play to develop they lower the boom on in there and i want you to look at one on one opportunity to cope with i see with his favorite target <person player="jordan shipley" race="UNK" position="WR">shipley</person> going up against chris <person player="brent nickerson" race="UNK" position="DB">nickerson</person> the balls theyre very easily could have been a touchdown that was<person player="daniel howard" race="UNK" position="DL">daniel howard</person>who got in on the quarterback sucker that running rugby punt trying to get on the ground as quickly as they can and it filled it dangerously by wolf at the 5yard line williams down to make that stop tech leads it five nothing you mike youre a friend of mine youre a great coach dont do anything different just do whatever youve been doing because whatever it is it works youre an amazing guy motivate those players you may very well come out with a victory donald trump a friend of mike leach leach tour in new york with his family paid a visit to his office unannounced later trump contacted him and theyve been telephone buddies ever since they talked two days ago fumbling the end zone is that a laterally and complete the line judge right there said forward pass incomplete itll be second down that punter for 60 yards but that s a great story but though he s talking about strange of a couple that s an odd couple right there another snap issue protected tank herald fortunate to be able to get a hold of this football that s not that bad about it his knees he misses it but look out quick texas get in there to put the pressure on to<person player="graham harrell" race="UNK" position="QB">graham harrell</person>steven hamm be bending over the ball now on the second down and ten back to the running play and that s brewing <person player="roy miller" race="UNK" position="DL">miller</person> making the stop on back the third downs have been interesting for texas tech so far tonight now they hit two of four will muschamp continues to mix it up showing different pressures backing out showing no pressure at all and in bringing it my guess is here third down the texas tech back into their up close to their own endzone probably going to bring some kind of pressure here to try to force<person player="graham harrell" race="UNK" position="QB">graham harrell</person>out of the pocket leach will throw going in going to go deep midfield by<person player="edward britton" race="UNK" position="WR">edward britton</person>remember he dropped that one down on the goal line but this time he comes up with a huge third down play i guess <person player="curtis brown" race="UNK" position="DB">curtis</person> brian hey<person player="curtis brown" race="UNK" position="DB">curtis brown</person>last week stepped in for shonky brown it did a great job against ted bryant but this give you an idea effective attack and how you get so caught up in beat ron lewis and<person player="michael crabtree" race="nonwhite" position="WR">michael crabtree</person>i mean it s britain the speeds are on the other side that gets downfield and beat<person player="curtis brown" race="UNK" position="DB">curtis brown</person>for a big play jarrell has already thrown for 133 yards against the horns defense raiders up five going again on the move hell throw this one away and then we suck it down and then and let s go to <person player="matt williams" race="UNK" position="K">matt</person> winer in new york <person player="matt williams" race="UNK" position="K">matt</person> all right <person player="brent nickerson" race="UNK" position="DB">brent</person> our nominee for the pontiac gamechanging performance comes who go to state and georgia tech seminoles threatening to take the lead in the final benefit cooper taylor jarred the ball loose from <person player="marcus bunton" race="UNK" position="DB">marcus</person> s deck seals its first ever acc win over florida state you can go for your funny at game chances this woman s starting tomorrow at 9:00 on espncom mr herbstreit i certainly hope you two are in the northwestern s winning play as a game change our moment that is reception recoup did he play the year there s crap hurry on that middle screen except about 9 and reaching down toward that ankle again remember it s bothered him a little bit lisa gave us the report for down below you touched on it texas looked at this is part of the run game and texas tech will continue to run different forms of the screen it slows down the pressure from the defensive line coming after<person player="graham harrell" race="UNK" position="QB">graham harrell</person>and it wears them down it s just another wrinkle another thing for the defense to have to deal with third in two and whoops back in as the running back and now barrel against this defense is going to back it up and give them the passing level great branch for the 30yard line<person player="graham harrell" race="UNK" position="QB">graham harrell</person>saw that coming all away with interesting hair brown talked about were the main reasons<person player="graham harrell" race="UNK" position="QB">graham harrell</person>didnt end up going to often is because of his inability to won the football or his desire to run the football and now as you see it a big third down<person player="graham harrell" race="UNK" position="QB">graham harrell</person>showing it again he didnt run the ball look at this who would have ever guessed in the first quarter the texas would have the football for about two and a half minutes it sounded two minutes here in the opening quarter play fake fires complete again a glory ours erik <person player="eric morris" race="UNK" position="WR">morris</person> the senior people always want to know what s different about mike leach and in his version of the spread of course they spread you out from sideline to sideline i think it s the way they utilize so many different weapons everybody is involved in throwing being able to throw the football and mike leach and his quarterback to a good job of not only spreading the field of formations but actually throwing it to a number of different targets second one here comes back first down plus with a 15yard line this is the biggest difference with texas tech this year youve got to be able to respect this and the reason that s important listen they only run for 139 yards a game but the fact that theyre willing to do that it s different this year they can control the line of scrimmage with the line and they have two backs that can run the football and it slows down again the pressure eventually on<person player="graham harrell" race="UNK" position="QB">graham harrell</person>because the defense cant pin his ears back alarm you know that costume harold saw it coming and tried to speed it up but that late shift caught on out on that rattle you got the time the first of a half like number one got somebody online 30 second time 35 leach doesnt like bernie one right there but they did to save the five so well take a timeout here a boxing coach who has saved countless kids from the streets sugar ray leonard george foreman oscar de la hoya joined the extreme team an allnew extreme makeover home edition sunday 8:00 7:00 central on abc ray veilleux s going in first down and 10 time running out of the opening quarter all day we get the first down as a penalty flag comes flying <person player="eric morris" race="UNK" position="WR">morris</person> was struggling to get it at you is it a facemask it looked like<person player="earl thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">earl thomas</person>came in hi he s trying to come in to make attention bow faith math keeps smbus well a festival automatic first down and if it was <person player="earl thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">thomas</person> but a great job of sitting in his own planning the whole<person player="eric morris" race="UNK" position="WR">eric morris</person>once <person player="earl thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">thomas</person> comes in he grabs the side of the helmet very close that big mass they got it will harold show mac brown again he s a runner he s run for a few touchdowns in this offense seconds ticking away itll be back touchdown bearing back with the evenings first story this first quarter my opinion is tech suspect controlling the line of scrimmage on both sides of the football<person player="matt williams" race="UNK" position="K">matt williams</person>a field goal ten for ten what a fine one night in the stands now he s one of the most popular players at texas tech well return after this press it didnt work my abc stations twentyseven plays of that first quarter for texas day eight for the long run about three weeks back the horns fell down 11 to oklahoma you know what happened of the king and <person player="jordan shipley" race="UNK" position="WR">shipley</person> is back deep with confidence that s been their characteristic this year this run of being ranked at the top though probably heaping college football but all who played in a had a big comeback in an opportunity to do that paradigm shift is out to the 20 and there s a penalty on the return let s go back to the touch time for rent this is your kind of football watch two guards just little kickout block right here and a big block by the center to open this up for the running back <person player="baron batch" race="UNK" position="RB">baron</person> back look at the line control thing and look how nasty this texas tech offensive line is watch hand me the center right there in the middle number 71 he locks up with muckelroy the leading tackler from texas takes him into the ground and buries him into the end zone sends a message along with the block that s how mike leach described his offensive line in the last practice he said nasty maybe i shouldnt say that they look nasty im very big bastard or a big 12 officiating crew our referee karl richard illegal block in the back by the return team number 81 the ball fourth in the longhorns are off stride here early there is certainly no question they just gave up a 10blade 96 yard scoring play were down by 12 and the staff searching for some answers but you say you want to be the number one team let s show america why youre the number one team you can see what happened that s the bat who picked off three kansas passes last week and that rather than <person player="hunter lawrence" race="UNK" position="K">lawrence</person> could throw over naya there s a fine receiver after the 14 we check them on that whiner in new york man all right <person player="brent nickerson" race="UNK" position="DB">brent</person> here s another nominee for the ates being a home america player of the week both on the state receiver dez bryant has been great all season nine catches 171,000 touchdown resume the cavalier out of iowa state textmode to five one two three four on june 18th meanwhile it s home and cast your vote second down and three from a koi in

<person player="brent nickerson" race="UNK" position="DB">brent</person> i am very very impressed with ruffin mcneill the defensive coordinator and what he s been able to do with his texas tech deep is early in this game getting a lot of pressure with just four theyre not being overly create over complex with their scheme with how theyre attacking theyre watching with four just winning the battle of what one more defensive end from east carolina for that broad a circle a man wont give it going mcniel getting squeezed and see say brandon see say from atlanta georgia closed it down how do you like to be<person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt mccoy</person>running into this role of jersey looks in a great job especially this defensive line the way theyre getting in their

on abc cant find a ticket so you take to the trees look just like the old days and not all gang in baseball on to get a peek here the red raiders and<person player="graham harrell" race="UNK" position="QB">graham harrell</person>pulls out and drops it off underneath the <person player="shannon woods" race="UNK" position="RB">woods</person> was the running backs gotten nine more before mcelroy pulls him down now curt look at the pacific life game summary pretty onesided here that this is shocking at this point through a court <person player="dustin earnest" race="UNK" position="LB">earnest</person> in a couple minutes scram harold having a great day what you would expect and the shocker is called the boy not only that he s not having much production he s just he s sitting on the sidelines not kidding very many opportunities because of the way<person player="graham harrell" race="UNK" position="QB">graham harrell</person>is performing and also just because texas tech keeps putting him to the sidelines second down and one here comes which for the first down breaking today like different looking office with that running game beasley for his would stand it there s so many things you have to defend and they do such a good job of giving different looks it just makes the defense constantly on their heels with their heads moving back and forth trying to speculate where the ball might be going they do such a good job of mixing in just enough run with the past beasley never leave is shaken up on the play down at the 32 yard line being tended to by the texas medical staff well the chase is on in texas you go over the speed where they think he s 5under kenny anybody anybody slow down jimmie <person player="cody johnson" race="UNK" position="RB">johnson</person> going for the threepeat that would be something now coverage begins with nascar countdown at 3:00 eastern on abc there s there s your standings and so for a guide it doesnt really follow this is that jimmie <person player="cody johnson" race="UNK" position="RB">johnson</person> or is that the car or is that the guys changing tires all the way above okay okay i did jimmie <person player="cody johnson" race="UNK" position="RB">johnson</person> you know at a certain point when those guys are on the edge they make all the difference in the world and for him to have won the last two chases yeah and now to be headed he s headed for the hall of fame okay he is a difference maker but dont take anything away from that crew nothing away from the car they do a great job you know really our there s three races left for jimmie <person player="cody johnson" race="UNK" position="RB">johnson</person> to threepeat okay go jimmy those down in ted now for the red raiders inside handoff breaking his <person player="baron batch" race="UNK" position="RB">batch</person> who scored the game s first touchdown muscle eat his way to midfield and they continue to pound away on the number one team in the country i hear great vision by <person player="baron batch" race="UNK" position="RB">baron</person> patch youre right it s an offensive line weve fought throughout this entire broadcast theyre controlling thing but it s just a vision and then to cut back there by <person player="baron batch" race="UNK" position="RB">batch</person> and it gives you an idea once you make that first time in there are such big themes because you were spread out so far in this defense you break through that initial line of scrimmage and youve got room to run read <person player="louis vasquez" race="UNK" position="OL">vasquez</person> can be <person player="brandon carter" race="UNK" position="OL">carter</person> and win let s your offensive line <person player="graham harrell" race="UNK" position="QB">harrell</person> wide open in the middle is window put three receivers to the top great protection by the offensive line look at the linebacker it s a great idea muckleroy turning looking to the left looking to the right but a time he realized in swindles going to come through his area he s already buying that a huge spot right there again for harold to throw the football they faked by errol he s going to drop off another screen past the patch and that one was read perfectly that time by william we want to show you this offensive line <person player="ryland reed" race="UNK" position="OL">ryland</person> read folks at 673 414 pounds he spent four years in the chicago white sox organization and the righthanded pitcher luis <person

carter</person>capice mr halloween over there wants to be a pro wrestler i mean this is this is an nfl size offensive line is no doubt about when look what theyre leading here that kind of possession though <person player="graham harrell" race="UNK" position="QB">harrell</person> they get in time cant find anybody open you know im impressed by harold buying time with his feet now he doesnt take off downfield but weve seen him moved to the right that time to the left he buys extra time im really impressed when he buys time the spacing of this offense is so important and you can see that they work on him moving and getting out of the pocket and then not panicking as wide receivers but they they and find the opening in the zone and stay away from each other start there four of six down on third down lead 14 drops back to midfield fires reaching for the first down and you got it while leon talk about a first down pitch going back near midfield before he finally unloaded her and this what are you to do here you rush for your drop seven you cant get pressure on him it s a <person player="jamar wall" race="UNK" position="DB">wall</person> as an offensive line he s just dancing around waiting until somebody breaks open and again you go back to the relationship between the wide receivers this case lee long and the quarterback<person player="graham harrell" race="UNK" position="QB">graham harrell</person>they always know how to work back the<person player="graham harrell" race="UNK" position="QB">graham harrell</person>there it is first down it s clerk another guy for ten second the mad scientist a dial of another one meanwhile on the other side when we talked to muschamp we said are you at all concerned about this young secondary in deep against this passing attack he snapped like this theyre sophomores theyve been around long enough now but they are under assault here tonight low snap fix it up man wide open touchdown<person player="eric morris" race="UNK" position="WR">eric morris</person>his fifth touchdown of the season they call him elf because he usually finds the space underneath the zone and makes plays all our wes welker who used to

height play by<person player="eric morris" race="UNK" position="WR">eric morris</person>and again the weapons here these guys remind me of just jim ray they look like they just practice he s routes over and over and over again and theyre just in rhythm it in safe right now in this game so far just a tremendous performance by the tech defense incomplete and suddenly at his second in ten we have not seen coke <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">mccoy</person> and his texas offense struggle like this all year this is where youre tempted youve got a number of drops the it s dominated by this texas tech defensive line threeman rush and it is suddenly third and 10 i think he had a free play man that they move a detective may have knew that to top the defensive end offside he frets mber 46 fiveyard penalty still second up that is the first penalty of the night against the raiders and that s a bit of a story they are one of the most heavily penalized teams in the country they with that entire first quarter without a penalty not going to buy pumpfake nobody open was to take it out of bounds short of midfield mack brown im sure reminding his team the last time they came to love it remember they were down 21 to nothing fought their way back into the game and eventually won 35 to 31 if im mack brown im reminding him mister hey were veteran team long way to go keep your poise almost picked off charbonnet<person player="daniel charbonnet" race="UNK" position="DB">daniel charbonnet</person>who transferred from duke almost picked it off this defense is incredibly wellprepared and what theyve seen from <person player="matt williams" race="UNK" position="K">matt</person> from both <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">mccoy</person> and the success that they have had any last few weeks sitting on route knowing what s coming before it even comes weve seen pope appointee last two or three weeks make every single throws making the same throws the difference inspected tech is all over his receivers this is the second consecutive three and out for the horns this will mark three straight prints after yielding a safety on the first play from scrimmage and this one will go out of bounds and it will be marked on the 13 yard line the number one team in the nation under fire lubbock texas well that opening drive tech punted that set up the safety then in their next three field goal touchdown touchdown and now theyve got it again come out short of the 20 yard line first and 10 blank screen with pratt free another first and then put it down there s a fumble horns are signaling if theyve got it backgrounds right in the middle williams get away with it<person player="aaron williams" race="UNK" position="DB">aaron williams</person>wow big play in texas in football another bigplay protected tech friend <person player="michael crabtree" race="nonwhite" position="WR">crabtree</person> can make this catch he gets now feel minnie gets hit the ball is away from his body the ball is out it lands right on top of a texas defender <person player="sergio kindle" race="UNK" position="LB">kindle</person> watch <person player="sergio kindle" race="UNK" position="LB">kindle</person> yep the linebacker number two move in on the ball watch him rip it i think it lands right it bounces right into his stomach then williams jumps over there<person player="aaron williams" race="UNK" position="DB">aaron williams</person>jumps on the ball and recovers it so now their best field position on i their best opportunity to climb back in the middle of it overnight well run on first and then <person player="michael crabtree" race="nonwhite" position="WR">crabtree</person> being consoled by one of the coaches on the sidelines over there could be the big play to texas needs to spark his team the thing that i want to talk about texas has to do is run the football it s the first time this year we have seen a lack of a running game from texas purse them in a football game texas tech has two safety synergy look at it right here and you have two safeties and a thief youve got to run the football the other night does just that runs it for a 1st and 10 but bath comes up from one of the safety spots to make the tackle if im in a crown and im <person player="greg smith" race="UNK" position="TE">greg</person> davis the offensive coordinator im talking to that offensive line and saying guys enough is enough weve got to control the line of scrimmage if theyre going to play with two safeties back we cant throw the football down field we have to run the ball which means youve got to win youre blocked up front safety s a <person player="jamar wall" race="UNK" position="DB">wall</person> off that line of scrimmage again instruct why this time obon i didnt have a chance charbonnet kept him outside that time it did a very good job and if you have to hit frank now you cannot take so much time to develop a play when you get a big turnover youve got great deal position you have an offense that s been sluggish those first two plays i think are exactly what texas needs to do run right into the center the texas tech defense north and south you cant bounce out to the outside of a slow developing play the defense is moving to say now second and 13 before and he s in trouble again sacked by<person player="brandon williams" race="UNK" position="DL">brandon williams</person>the two here from fort worth texas number 84 again this defense wellprepared with both <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">mccoy</person> drops back to pass they are taking away every option the safety s coming in not doing any print downfield they are able to come up and help on the crossing route the linebackers and corners are taking away the receivers to the outside both <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">mccoy</person> has nobody to throw the football third and 16 cant find anybody steps away throwing down at the 48yard line v williams again what an impressive effort texas tech defense this is where<person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt mccoy</person>has been making plays in his last three weeks to get very good defenses feels the pressure okay gets away from it now were used to seeing him run away from the defense and make a play he

run so far for the story of this game really have been the performance of the road raider defense they always expect the road later offense to move the ball which which they certainly have done completely outside short of a first down and all right how many do you think up to seven yeah go ahead for pretty close my friend pretty close okay it has been three oh thud kingsbury okay bj7 sanatorium harold for a bonus answer do you know some of the others im including harold commission switch how about fungus a country where no clinging plane was definitely <person player="david snow"

running it back with <person player="shannon woods" race="UNK" position="RB">woods</person> down to the 32yard on or this offensive line is just taking control of the game read with a nice blog on a rack po and then look at him get to the second level great blocking and great play calling by mike lee this texas defense is completely completely on its heels and again with <person player="shannon woods" race="UNK" position="RB">woods</person> for another first down and into the red zone and this is the aspect is it s different this is very different if youre not familiar with my fleet and youre watching for the first time youre seeing this balance youre seeing this running game they havent had this in the past theyre running the football right now and controlling things upfront and now theyll go back to the breadandbutter and be able to throw the ball theyre going to close cannot 100 yards rushing maybe before this happened we only need 30 yards to do that it could have a breed of yard rushing here in the first half that you scored the touchdown first tackle by <person player="sergio kindle" race="UNK" position="LB">kindle</person> it s back for a yard let s check in bullet down below with lisa well <person player="brent nickerson" race="UNK" position="DB">brent</person> you know kirk is always talking about body language texas all fences over here sitting on the bench looking absolutely shellshocked earlier in the quarter crop report was going up and down to the offense trying to rally his troops telling them look theyre not doing anything special nothing we havent seen before we just got to play our game so far though texas hasnt responded frank theyll be reminded not only of the comeback that kirk lowe javad but what happened last year in austin they came from behind and overpowers the red raiders in the fourth quarter carroll could break a crap 3 again the work of<person player="michael crabtree" race="nonwhite" position="WR">michael crabtree</person>we saw last year without physical year just pushing brown to the side make the catch of this witness what separation he never gives up he s physical he s athletic and he has desire life reminds me

goodlooking prospect there and williams number four protected this time sitting on a route himself not allowing<person player="eric morris" race="UNK" position="WR">eric morris</person>be able to make those play they will not go for the field goal here mike leach has dialed up a both end for first down marker right at that 10 yard line and now hell flows back out did not draw them offside well see if leach sends young williams out out of the field to attempt another field goal so here is<person player="matt williams" race="UNK" position="K">matt williams</person>who learned the kicking job winning a contest four years free rent two weeks back and when leach was notified that he was eligible to play put him in uniform hit nine extra points last week against kansas has already hit a field goal in this game and he rips 831 yarder holy toledo steps in no problem i saw some signs that came dave saying he was the player of the year that williams for heisman we got there and made story course on election eve monday night football it s the steelers and a redskins in washington captain chris berman will speak with john mccain barack obama in their last national interviews so itll be the steelers and the redskins and the redskins under jim zorn seemed to have put it back together again i think after watching them in the first game without what s he doing as a head coach but you know now theyre pretty good take the cameras nice job controlling the game and i think dorn being there coming something im a bengals fan to the nfl seasons been over for me they wont go on a click speed oh i wish so wont go at 60 going to draft right did you say an effort 20 years well they can trade otro cinco or whatever he calls himself a debut hole right there okay look at this look at his numbers tell you the story folks the mad scientist had dominated this one and he s got a fine forever son of a coach well be seeing him on nfl football someday no question about that him get a shot goodlooking player and then it 37 to go back at the end zone and taking a knee is williams now let s go back to new york <person player="matt williams" race="UNK" position="K">matt</person> winer for a sportscenter right now <person player="matt williams" race="UNK" position="K">matt</person> i fred smooth enter right now powered by video tim tebow had three rushing touchdowns today to prove stuff the top floor that s a multibit you had maddie threw for two more all gators who hammer georgia today and the worst loss of mark rick s career people may be creeping up those heisman charts again guys now that s interesting because both <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">mccoy</person> who came in the leader he has faded a little bit here in the is it dont overlook<person player="graham harrell" race="UNK" position="QB">graham harrell</person>graham harold he s able to hold on it win here the 15 go to the big step we both got plenty of time they can strike they start off with a screen over high and what a defensive performance<person player="marlon williams" race="UNK" position="LB">marlon williams</person>has been all over the field for the raiders sitting up here in his first half i see one team that s hungry that s playing with desired it s in black and another team that looked lost that dressed in white alright steps away from the pressure and takes off his best run of the night out to the 44 yard line we got a minutes board to work with and it s the first time weve seen both <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">mccoy</person> have some room to step up in the pocket he s almost back there by dictum but he s able to pick up valuable orders when he s seven yards on that run by <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">mccoy</person> now he comes back with another first down as he strikes the<person player="brandon collins" race="UNK" position="WR">brandon collins</person>brandon makes the reception gives him depth at receiver along with<person player="malcolm williams" race="UNK" position="WR">malcolm williams</person>hopeful coy very comfortable in this obviously still had three timeouts now down at 52 seconds is the clock stopped for the first so the red raiders call a timeout and one of the things that their coach mcneil says youve got to keep rested rushman on the field coming up now the capital one halftime report well have all these scores in highlights john craig and doug and it s been a busy day one of the great plays of the day was northwestern as it appeared that game was headed for overtime up in minneapolis and ball off a facemask intercepted touchdown and it looked like minnesota at that point again killing the clock trying to go surprised that they were still throwing with the ball deep in their own territory while our friend in threat billman is going to be under a little bit of heat about the management of the clock and what went on hey loss to michigan state ill tell you that genome ah antonia wanted credit for getting back and finding a way to win now it s go went today so weve got first and ten tory s got time and it s dropped again this time it s connelly check that that was <person player="brandon collins" race="UNK" position="WR">collins</person> check that that was<person player="brandon collins" race="UNK" position="WR">brandon collins</person>and put that one down in texas what about their fourth drop here in the first half receiving group usually very reliable home perfectly thrown collin looking where he wanted to go before he caught the football 46 seconds for cole that s the way for the portrait dumps it in underneath this shipment and <person player="jordan shipley" race="UNK" position="WR">shipley</person> s got first intent out of bounds at the 30 yard line down this room and that s his first of the night it looked like <person player="jordan shipley" race="UNK" position="WR">shipley</person> had a touchdown earlier in the game and let it get away from him there is a flag down personal foul offense number 74 mike dancer to face 15yard penalty lee stepping down you letovsky and he s got one of the better pass rushers going up against him on this defense the cantor <person player="mckinner dixon" race="UNK" position="DL">dixon</person> off to the far left with his hands up right in the face master locks on to it and a huge gain now the texas steps way back yeah the good call an obvious call but <person player="jordan shipley" race="UNK" position="WR">shipley</person> puts them at least in field goal range then theyre back to their own 39 yard line till three timeouts left texas without 75 yards of offense in the first half in this game incomplete in <person player="brian duncan" race="UNK" position="LB">duncan</person> and that was <person player="jordan shipley" race="UNK" position="WR">shipley</person> going for another one there s another example of this defense taking away the inside route how many times have we seen texas throw the ball in that area or linebackers and safety have a tough time allowing distance not allowing them severs to get to the middle of the field you tied theyre spinning on those route necks i made it nokton <person player="brian duncan" race="UNK" position="LB">duncan</person> just knocked it away horns call the timeout with 35 and curt you know maybe maybe the folks were right when they said texas tech has got a better defense this year certainly what weve seen here in the first half people have been arent familiar with texas tech you got understand it s the team that s been averaging eight wins under mike leach since she s been here back in august with the veteran leadership that they had returning with a three year starting quarterback a better defense a better running it they felt in august this was their year to get by texas to get by oklahoma to go to the big 12 championship so it s not a shock to their fan base they expected this kind of run but what theyve done in this first half ill say it for me im shocked to see them at this point up 22 to three possibly as we get ready here for halftime third and 25 got oneonone on that far side and it s there that was williams and what a great reception working oneonone on that far sideline for 44 yards and it s <person player="brent nickerson" race="UNK" position="DB">nickerson</person> again earlier in this game texas got behind him the balls just thrown up high and you have<person player="malcolm williams" race="UNK" position="WR">malcolm williams</person>at 63 going up and over <person player="brett dewhurst" race="UNK" position="DB">brett</person> <person player="brent nickerson" race="UNK" position="DB">nickerson</person> that time if it s huge catch for texas threeman rush and they sack got to use the convoy with a threeman rush ruffin mcneil telling us we not only have to get the pressure off the edge with our defensive ends weve got to be able to get a push in the middle they rush three and then a fourth defender comes in late but look at the speed it s forcing<person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt mccoy</person>to step up i trips over his own guy but the reason is there s a linebacker pushing him right back into the face of<person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt mccoy</person>there<person player="chris hall" race="UNK" position="OL">chris hall</person>was the lineman that he tripped on texas with one timeout that s a jelly instead and how well the red raiders have played defense here in the face moving the pocket to the right fires back middle incomplete third and 13 coming up with 16 seconds at one time on <person player="matt williams" race="UNK" position="K">matt</person> checking oclock at the very least he wants to get out of here with a second field it has to what makes it so easy for a defense when you can consistently get out to the quarterback with by rushing three and sometimes four and you create havoc for coble boy boy it makes it easy to be able to cover with seven or eight defenders against the receiver <person player="cory fowler" race="UNK" position="K">cory</person> not hitting even 50% the inside shuttle fast open eye hell step out of bounds with these across the 10 yard get out of bounds never use this last timeout to get the field goal team out i dont think got the first down the yard short and he didnt get out of bounds mack brown had to call that timeout from the sidelines when i had some room to work with here picks up a block by <person player="charlie tanner" race="UNK" position="OL">tanner</person> i would say there does a better job there there does a better job there blocking against <person player="brent nickerson" race="UNK" position="DB">nickerson</person> i think it makes it easier for obon ayah to make a quicker decision to either get out of bounds or get upfield he s inbounder it s a very tackle of all theyre at the 8 yard line 6 ticks of the clock got to take a you got to take the point coil stay on the sidelines a question let s go to make this 22 6 here puts it down two scores remember with the twopoint conversion who gets up down a sixteen right here for <person player="hunter lawrence" race="UNK" position="K">lawrence</person> already made a 43yarder here in this one is 25 nails it that s manageable but they look anything but the number one team in the nation filled with at the 4 yard line to the 25yard line and that s where<person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt mccoy</person>s we show you the southwest airlines playbook first snap of the game folks first offensive play was a safety and they just took it from there i think it set the tone tech the tech controlled the line of scrimmage defensively theyve been chasing<person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt mccoy</person>around texas hasnt been able to run the ball consistently on the other side texas tech has been able to run they have been able to protect ram <person player="graham harrell" race="UNK" position="QB">harrell</person> and even when theyve gotten pressure on harold he found his receivers downfield complete domination in that first half by the red raiders stopped again by this radar defense just how good has this defense been here tonight against the texas offense well let s compare what s going on with what theyve accomplished in your pacific life game summary throughout the season scoring 45 points a game tonight only six rushing for almost two of us not only 31 passing for 300 tonight only 68 third down 59% of the year tonight only 1 of 7 <person player="foswhitt whittaker" race="UNK" position="RB">whittaker</person> is going to see some action here as they snap it off to kuykendall and that appears to be a horn first down you look at those numbers and you think how how has texas tech been able to come up with some kind of magic formula to be able to stop<person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt mccoy</person>we touched on it the entire broadcast theyve gotten pressure with their front floor it s allowed him to keep seven defenders and face to defend pull the boys receivers before he keeps it and he s going to get a rip down by <person player="colby whitlock" race="UNK" position="DL">whitlock</person> when you dominate the line of scrimmage you negate playmakers and that s what theyve been able to do <person player="colby whitlock" race="UNK" position="DL">whitlock</person> this time gets penetration <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">mccoy</person> comes off of the play fake the whitaker youre not supposed to see a defensive tackle when you come off of a play fake youre trying to get to the outside the last thing youre thinking about is <person player="colby whitlock" race="UNK" position="DL">whitlock</person> at 290 pounds getting by your offensive guard second as well they drop it in that is <person player="jordan shipley" race="UNK" position="WR">shipley</person> trying to set him loose on the screen <person player="colby whitlock" race="UNK" position="DL">whitlock</person> again making a stop there is one story i want to update everybody on throughout the week in austin number six<person player="quan cosby" race="nonwhite" position="WR">quan cosby</person>or a green jersey that means when you work for background and youre in green that means youre injured so all week long he wore the green and austin and that puts them here tonight if he s not at full sprint third down and seven under pressure again drops it off incomplete that was <person player="mckinner dixon" race="UNK" position="DL">dixon</person> mccrory taking a lickin here tonight at the hands of the red raiders it s pretty good path protection but look at the receiver how many receivers you can see try to find an open receiver there s nobody open everybody is covered by texas tech and eventually the raiders get to<person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt mccoy</person>can he because he has nobody to throw to and again it s the big fella <person player="colby whitlock" race="UNK" position="DL">whitlock</person> who finishes the deal comes right on top of<person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt mccoy</person>tuck her back to punt the rugby punt and puts it on the ground<person player="eric morris" race="UNK" position="WR">eric morris</person>what s his role is going to be downed he was in the end zone with his hand on it go theyre going to mark it right there it s where the football is yep the nfl they had super deal it s a different deal let s take a look at it now this is a 61 yard punt williams has downed it right there this espn telecast available in high definition on abc hd ella red raiders are backed up for their own oneyard line but remember now in the first quarter they had a 96yard drop and koco has been taking a lickin which slips out for a couple of yards and let s go back and look at this we talked about how they got pressure on him and if you look closely if he steps up <person player="colby whitlock" race="UNK" position="DL">whitlock</person> comes up and underneath but all of his weight comes right on the chin of<person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt mccoy</person>homeaway walked off to the sidelines but since he s been on the sidelines he s been a bit dazed spitting blood trainers checking him out second down and eight for the raiders which trying to sweep left and this will put third and short bigtime play that time by bono able to get through there get a hand on would slow him down but this is where texas tech <person player="brent nickerson" race="UNK" position="DB">brent</person> had so much success in the first half it was five of eight on third down situation well see if theyve started his second half with similar success a lot of times he was able to break to the outside and buy time and eventually find open receivers <person player="earl thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">earl</person> s been sacked only one time tonight third down and three keeping on a ground short and it s going to be three and done on this drive and i could set up the horns muckleroy makes the play defensively <person player="brett dewhurst" race="UNK" position="DB">brett</person> for the first times weve seen all this entire football game this texas defensive front taking control that s why well muschamp is fired up that s a great way for him and his his side of the football just start the second half control things up front and negate any kind of running lang at all for <person player="shannon woods" race="UNK" position="RB">woods</person> that s the first three on out of this game for texas tech look for then with <person player="quan cosby" race="nonwhite" position="WR">cosby</person> injured <person player="jordan shipley" race="UNK" position="WR">shipley</person> fields it at the 45 this can be great field position for the horns he s got an alley there is a penalty flag down as he goes into the end zone there is a flag at the 30 yard line it was a questionable block there <person player="brent nickerson" race="UNK" position="DB">brent</person> and i thought i didnt know if texas player got his head on the right side of the shoulder or not it was close there is no foul for illegal block in the back is down <person player="jordan shipley" race="UNK" position="WR">shipley</person> a 45yard punt return and just like in dallas a few weeks ago against the oklahoma sooners <person player="jordan shipley" race="UNK" position="WR">shipley</person> comes up with a huge return and this is the block that i thought was a bit of a gray hair and i said that s where the flag might have been but they picked it up and said no foul and once he got to the outside of course with his quickness he gets to the outside and scored the touchdown but<person player="jordan shipley" race="UNK" position="WR">jordan shipley</person>the leader steps up and makes a huge play for the longhorns now on saundra attempt the extra point number way back nearly going in this game simply dropped what might have been a touchdown pass but this time he takes the punt in <person player="hunter lawrence" race="UNK" position="K">lawrence</person> tax on the extra point and it s 22 thursday stage is set in london you are

position="WR">shipley</person> for a touchdown when we go back to that game remember oklahoma had a lead and started to take control of this football game and just when it looked like oklahoma might pull away who else<person player="jordan shipley" race="UNK" position="WR">jordan shipley</person>comes up with a 96yard kickoff return for a touchdown did put the horns back in that football game and changed the momentum completely around fast for three weeks later how in lubbock cant get anything going on the road youre down 22 to thick who comes up with a big play again <person player="jordan shipley" race="UNK" position="WR">jordan</person> shipper now big series for grandmary last one was three and out and set up that punt return for a touchdown the boards of a plan with some flashy motion on first down he puts it in <person player="eric morris" race="UNK" position="WR">morris</person> s hand shifflett makes a return here i think a lot of people can be talking about that block for the middle to build but a freshman<person player="earl thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">earl thomas</person>initially see the flag coming in of course they picked it up i like with mike leach did on that first play rent it ran three straight times on that three and out this time they come back put the football back into the hand to<person player="graham harrell" race="UNK" position="QB">graham harrell</person>and try to find their receivers in space matches the running back carroll under center will give it to him and he bangs straight ahead for the first down muckelroy making the stop muffled oh i made a big stop on that third down to force that part so number 38 came up big and a little bit slow to get up there is mr <person player="brandon carter" race="UNK" position="OL">carter</person> something to keep in mind of this game moves forward weve talked a lot tonight about texas tech controlling the line of scrimmage on both sides itll be interesting to see which team is in better shape this fatigue start to set in for either side of the ball especially up front for texas tech for texas jerald down the middle and he s got crap three <person player="michael crabtree" race="nonwhite" position="WR">crabtree</person> finds another hole and he s having a good night against them as <person player="blake gideon" race="UNK" position="DB">gideon</person> makes the play they clearly received food some of the receivers on the inside clear it out and then you know that<person player="michael crabtree" race="nonwhite" position="WR">michael crabtree</person>is going to come right over the middle of that defense the linebackers are occupied to the outside opening up with a huge window for <person player="michael crabtree" race="nonwhite" position="WR">crabtree</person> hunter rec pope who is down the allamerican defensive end for the horns he can ill afford to be without him very long he s down at the 22 yard line you hate to see that he means as much the long horn defense as<person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt mccoy</person>does to the long horn offense as far as playmaking ability and leadership seemed to be working on that left leg let s see what he but by hyperextended a little bit is what it looked like it he grasped got it right away means look concern there this is one of his true warriors he added a little boxing to his arsenal to well work on giving some hand speed puts up a ton of weight and weight room and those nice to see him walk off here or be putting a little bit of weight on that no yes it is really gimpy so remember <person player="quan cosby" race="nonwhite" position="WR">cosby</person> and lisa sending up word that it s doubtful of <person player="quan cosby" race="nonwhite" position="WR">cosby</person> will be able to come back for the offense and now well have to keep an eye on a rack pope first down and ten so<person player="henry melton" race="UNK" position="DL">henry melton</person>who was a running back for several years one of the defensive ends they throw that high <person player="michael crabtree" race="nonwhite" position="WR">crabtree</person> now talk tonight about the the big receivers that theyve been in the arena macklin for missouri they held in big catches 66 yards dez bryant week ago in austin 64 74 tonight already <person player="michael crabtree" race="nonwhite" position="WR">crabtree</person> has as many caches as macklin and more yards would you take for those three<person player="michael crabtree" race="nonwhite" position="WR">michael crabtree</person>with you but youve got a you know take a deep bow to macklin speed he s napping they better hop in speed in <person player="michael

280 all right tonight 20 later to have for only the second time this season so they have been one of the better secondhalf teams in college football this year he was a third down most champs got numbers on him and that s sort of a first down incomplete there force the punt must champs defense has come alive here in the second half coming alive up front even with a rack po down the leadership has to be now stepped up by<person player="roy miller" race="UNK" position="DL">roy miller</person>99 and that s exactly what he s able to provide is stepping up and going right by brandon corner it s a oneonone battle getting into the inside move things uses the speed to the outside and<person player="graham harrell" race="UNK" position="QB">graham harrell</person>was a few times weve seen him have to get rid of the football so the riverboat gamblers added again fourth down and three no sign of a punter this guy the people trying to draw him off again looks like it what they were trying to do and hell come on over give him five more yards for the for the punter the court rocks back out second time rent you touched on it texas is defense the adjustments and i dont you know i dont know if it s a huge adjustment i think it s the intensity that s changed on the texas defensive line <person player="victor hunter" race="UNK" position="LB">victor</person> call it a lot of the same paint schemes theyre just now getting after<person player="graham harrell" race="UNK" position="QB">graham harrell</person>theyre winning on third down <person player="jordan shipley" race="UNK" position="WR">shipley</person> is back deep again they went after this punt and i believe theyve got a piece of it to roll down just inside the 20yard line regardless but enormous heat applied by williams take a look and see if they didnt get a piece yes he did tough hombre coke bokura never been a better name quarterback austin 9 of 18 a year ago he was 21 to 34 260 with four touchdowns

clapping you assumed that would be a whole roll angel offense number 74 half the distance to the goal repeat second down near the tuskys had his hands full to our right to left of the offensive line just gets beat to the inside and then he was already past<person player="richard jones" race="UNK" position="DL">richard jones</person>was already gone and his hands and knees and then joukowsky came on top of him and that s when the late black damon jones have no chance to getting to the further steps up intercepted picked off by chardonnay and chardonnay williams continues to be perfect as a rep writers new kicker carbon is right here because thinking coverage and then restrict by restraining i think he was able to get into the lane and i think<person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt mccoy</person>expected him to fall into the flat charbonnet comes up with his fifth interception but he makes it he knows to get to the end zone and emma tech detect an opportunistic defense fifteen interceptions on the year the third of the nation so they get their chances they capitalize this november folks here comes bcs chaos this when you think you got it figured out the ghosts appear 29 to 13 still plenty of time now for the horns but they have been under their loan touchdown is the pump return they do not have an offensive drive for a score they had to settle for a couple of field goals if you want with us in the first half this game is reverberating from gainesville tuscaloosa state college all around the country now and the chaos that began last year in november you can take a look at all of the things that unfolded just when you think youve seen it all doctor and you know it s going to happen you just dont know when when and where it happens every year but you just made a point about this is far from over still seven and a half minutes to go but if it s going to turn hopeful poised leadership and that offensive line better start blocking people to connect this beck is coming after number twelve right here playaction gave him time and he overthrew his receiver second down and ten of course near the end of the game will select a chevrolet player of the game from each team that chevrolet will make a $1,000 contribution to each university s general scholarship fund big challenge for coco koi texas right now it s not trying to get it all back right away theyve got to stick with their plan and not press and not force the issue but that flames right into the hands of texas tech and theyre deepen horse great incompletions and so they stay on the ground this time with posit whitaker this is some fired up group the ruffin mcneil has put on the field defensively for the red raiders here tonight there s ruffin right there took over remember with the nine games remaining and he was the defensive coordinator down the stretch but a lot of energy free mind to defense he wanted the guys to play fast have fun be aggressive fix for that tonight they settle back into a threeman or they have changed that front all night complete for the first down they snaps off a strong throw that time to<person player="malcolm williams" race="UNK" position="WR">malcolm williams</person>not has been a good special teams player hi to<person player="malcolm williams" race="UNK" position="WR">malcolm williams</person>is going to have to step up along with<person player="brandon collins" race="UNK" position="WR">brandon collins</person>kuykendall just because of the injury to <person player="quan cosby" race="nonwhite" position="WR">cosby</person> it s time but he gets hit again and those hits take a toll on any quarterback including<person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt mccoy</person>williams with a nice gesture there s a pitch to whitaker moved to the 38 yard line whitaker could be a good addition here late in this game because of his quickness coming out of camp back in august they felt he was the gun but he battled through some the injury he is now healthy he s a great week of practice and on this astroturf because of his speed he gives them a home run threat in the backfield first down i swear the poise of this texas team and of course the quarterback<person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt mccoy</person>big timetested we talked all week about this being the end of a fourweek run of oklahoma and missouri and oklahoma state and when they have enough gas left in the tank to go to lubbock and deal with texas tech probable the toughest game of the floor first down fifthly again picking up on the leben yards on that play and out of bounds mac tried to portray it through his players as the first of another cycle not the last of the last cycle but you know physically and has to take its toll let s just consider the fact that <person player="quan cosby" race="nonwhite" position="WR">cosby</person> is watching for the side not playing for max now he s lost a rack powe for the night and this is worn away on the horns and a timeout first of the half call here by by texas tech in the quick and we take a look at at our quarterback comparison our two heisman trophy candidates and none of this print no that s exactly what s happened here time what s happened is texas tech which is really shocked me <person player="brent nickerson" race="UNK" position="DB">brent</person> is by winning the battle up front with their defensive line against texas is offensive line theyve kept two safeties at about 15 yards and what defenses do that a good offense will run the football into that law but because theyre losing the battle up front texas peckin is kind of having it both ways theyre controlling things and also protecting themselves against any big plays in the past game so texas is either had to run the ball or try to adjust nick one dime this insect defense down the field and theyve not been able to execute well enough to move the ball consistently down the field to all the credit to the front of this texas tech pika i think on the chlorine he s going to be sacked again that is the full sack of the night brandon would him brings him down that s his second just been talking about what s happening and this isnt an elaborate blitz scheme it four guys just going right five the offensive lineman of texas desire hunger texas tech watch this football game in the top part its entire night theyre showing it with the way this defense is playing now they start that action to the right and bring whitaker s out the other side you know the one player broken theyve been waiting for him because the jc guy is <person player="mckinner dixon" race="UNK" position="DL">dixon</person> and diction is causing a lot of trouble down there as mcneal continues to rotate in defensive lineman staying fresh <person player="brent nickerson" race="UNK" position="DB">brent</person> you talked about the importance of that welcome is neil telling us that <person player="mckinner dixon" race="UNK" position="DL">dixon</person> seven sacks coming into the night has powering quickness<person player="brandon williams" race="UNK" position="DL">brandon williams</person>eight backs coming into the next great tandem and theyre keeping fresh because theyre constantly coming on and off the field third na incomplete and it will be fourth down coming up for the horns there s a long throw and a top row for focal point it was a brown mack is thinking about going here when he s at the is at the 40 gr but the problem is if you fail giving this offense a short feel but max take it down 16 i got to go here ship leaves in his fly right here <person player="brent nickerson" race="UNK" position="DB">brent</person> see if they try to get him the football quick kick the second of the year by <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">mccoy</person> a second time he s done it and there is a penalty flag down at the 41 yard line i dont know if they had enough men on the line of scrimmage illegal formation offense 6mm line of scrimmage step ten eyes decline with overplay first down second sector so the mad scientist theyre not forget about that let s just take a pause before left a little perky okay were over here he s a beauty he s one of our alltime favorite quotes they had nobody in the game quite like mike leach every coach will tell you that every player will tell you that and all he does is put tons and tons of points up on that scoreboard kind of a perfect fit isnt it michael enos were in love it with texas neck have to be a real real good job get him out the texas defense has stepped up twice to for scram harold and sidelines you see what happened here the third film kendall s coming and a perfect strike with a penalty flag thrown on the play as lewis receiver time that umpire throws out often number 65 hands to the face half the distance to the goal repeat first down that s goes second time i think weve seen that call tuna i told you there s a bit of a nasty streak on text effects offensive line he s high he s done whatever it takes they keep <person player="roy miller" race="UNK" position="DL">miller</person> hook up back at the paddle a couple gladiators you got it man thank you coaches said weve had enough ability that back you can do whatever it takes big fella we dont want to see 99 anymore back there on our man his <person player="shannon woods" race="UNK" position="RB">woods</person> made the most out of that get into the short side sideline <person player="blake gideon" race="UNK" position="DB">gideon</person> function on that speed and that quickness comes in handy look like muckelroy was able to penetrate had a pretty good angle via watch but he got around the corner picked up with you play has been relatively quiet here in this half is prepped remember in catching the one in center field took the time from jailbreak screens all the way to the bottom there it is you called it kirk they put him over there set it up perfectly it s kind of sneak him around and i think the biggest difference with mike leach in the offense beyond the running game is how theyre doing such a good job of moving<person player="michael crabtree" race="nonwhite" position="WR">michael crabtree</person>around and look at the effort in the block that to me is the overlooked thing from texas tech the other receivers that dont make a catch are so willing and almost excited to block for their teammate from especially <person player="sergio kindle" race="UNK" position="LB">sergio</person> kendall number two is a bigtime football player lord adams he come play it now he s standing over there right part of the defense number two snaps off incomplete this is

leach brought the entire offense down and he s the insider depaul he s talking to his offense right now he knows theyve got to generate something theyve had a couple of three and outs there s a lake pitch out of bounds texas ball you got to tail back in the game right now it hasnt played a lot of football hopeful coy cant hang him out to dry like this he stretches at play stretches to play and in

there s about a minute to go watch the safety theyve been back there the whole game and what it does important cold to throw in the disc area right there that s the only thought he had patrol the

simply gave a little move to the outside to set him up and then cut back towards the middle i think everybody could tip past there that class was tip tip pass means it cannot be pass interference okay were gonna do that upstairs i think that s what every play should not mike is mean hain that should negate any kind of pass interference that ball is definitely tipped up front it s gonna pick up this flag the previous play is under further review so upstairs our replay official is terry turlington the area width option right here my limo pick this big ball up there the flex internet after that all

throw in the quick slant which texas tech does so well and so often once they get inside the 10yard line if youre a defensive back move in about a yard or two to the inside to take that easy throw away third and seven peril in trouble succulent not going away as kendall came in and cleaned it up but it was <person player="roy miller" race="UNK" position="DL">miller</person> and his buddies from

and incomplete <person player="michael crabtree" race="nonwhite" position="WR">crabtree</person> texas census emergency at this point with the ball inside the 10yard line theyve got to get pressure on harold is that a penalty flag that the was thrown weve had some heat flags south interfering often number 5 15yard penalty repeat second down the big physical wide receiver top of the screen well i dont know how you think and then the receiver slipped brown there was contact initially and the bad break on this was the fact that brown i think then slipped down and the official saw him on the grounds i think along with that initial contact i named it was lucky on <person player="michael crabtree" race="nonwhite" position="WR">crabtree</person> or i think there was contact on both sides there but because brown lead down maybe they felt that he hits bigger foot by <person player="michael crabtree" race="nonwhite" position="WR">crabtree</person> bursting goal but it s not at the 25yard line fires in zone this time not holding on his lewis k14 old <person player="earl thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">thomas</person> the freshman gameplay <person player="blake gideon" race="UNK" position="DB">gideon</person> have been tempted tonight but<person player="earl thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">earl thomas</person>who continues to improve in make plays had tremendous closing speed because i thought that ball might might sneak in there and get to lewis ill tell you what<person player="earl thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">earl thomas</person>last second comes up and not that football way great play again by another question from second goal there is going to get enzo incomplete he came right back to lewis that s one gram heroin love the hat back middle of that defense opened up he had exactly what he wanted he had lewis breaking to the middle the linebackers are occupied you see baba know takes <person player="shannon woods" race="UNK" position="RB">woods</person> look at the middle of that field he makes that catch he s got a chance to get upfield and if you can break a tackle from <person player="blake gideon" race="UNK" position="DB">gideon</person> closing in on him he might get into the end zone with a few passes that harold missed to third down this cambridge by almost intercepted almost picked off by <person player="earl thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">thomas</person> he took a 97 mile an hour fastball of the chest to care i dont think he realized that that ball was getting to him and two it actually bounced off of him at the last second he went to to make a play on the receiver and then he realized the ball was over thrown to the smaller<person player="eric morris" race="UNK" position="WR">eric morris</person>and it hits him right to chest you talked about in a break when you were talking about he go for it on fourth down or will he kick a field goal after the last one got lost now they may go to the longer legged kicker here they may go to the left footed youngster he s a little bit longer history and it inhales it they send corona onto the field he s been the kickoff man he hits the long one and it s 32 26 they lead it by six minor folks stay tuned after the game for your late local news over most of these abc stations and they havent had enough football worn over

field goal as the ball on the table it has come out on the 20yard line take a look now at the espnu allstate standings review certainly this game is not over but if you want to speculate if the longhorns lose does alabama automatically climb to number one kirk what s your feeling i think it depends on how voters look at this texas tech team and also what florida did today bren i expect florida move up in a big way and i think alabama morley likely would secure that number one spot there one you have to watch is oklahoma can put 60 58 on now on the blaster all right 1st down and 10 now for coker boy trying to engineer still another fourthquarter comeback trail 5 6 got booty atop a couple of timeouts remaining second down and ten went there <person player="jordan shipley"

being a difference in this game when texas wants to run the football now were starting to see just a little seam and it his help playing on his astroturf what acceleration we have not seen that from this texas open all year from a running back complained shepley while the sudden there s a hippo there s a rhythm that weve come to expect from<person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt mccoy</person>these last two possessions this is texas this is<person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt mccoy</person>this is what we expected to see this entire

duncan" race="UNK" position="LB">duncan</person> talked about him a lot tonight finds both the toy ruffin mcneil telling us we cannot allow a big crucial points in this game so mouthful before the scramble for ours well have somebody constantly watching him when he takes off the run open aiya back into the game and he appeared to have the first now be super the see if you get to the spot it s

big lead used to of their timeouts when it seemed that they might be meaningless those two timeouts would come in handy if texas ends up scoring a touchdown there s a great day this upstairs calling up the plays dolokhov he stood tough here tonight folks they pounded and pounded on him and yet here he comes cant count the young man out he s had six fourthquarter wins already and comeback mode he s looking for number seven if you ask<person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">colt mccoy</person>after this game about the individual numbers with him compared to<person player="graham harrell" race="UNK" position="QB">graham harrell</person>and if he s able to somehow get out of this game with a win he could care less about those individual stats weve already had some wonderful images from the day fabulous finishes in the bigs and northwestern the game was approaching overtime and interception when they judge that when he field goal for the spartans in florida rushing georgia in jacksonville and pittsburgh winning a for overtime thriller and south bend against the fighting irish and out in the rain in berkeley california beat oregon and now cal will head down the

this défis that has not been there most of his night in a huge game there on first and 10 <person player="greg smith" race="UNK" position="TE">greg</person> davis would like to take a little more time off the clock as he scores two and a half minutes remaining <person player="colt mccoy" race="white" position="QB">mccoy</person> keeps it got the first and 10 steps out of bounds so itll be first end

back in dramatic fashion to take a lead with 129 rene in this offensive line death up on this drive but it was a run for the past they took control of the scrimmage for the first time i think the entire night and allow vocaloid and his skill to do what they do been so it s up to<person player="hunter lawrence" race="UNK" position="K">hunter lawrence</person>there s the quarterback on the coach blotting what theyre going to do and they are down for the first time tonight 33 32 wow what a turnaround here how about the blocking up front a counter play and look at the hole from vaughn dramedy to run right through there s nobody there offensive lineman hicks and blackery come around hey open that up and i got to go back to cocacola it hopeful boy has been on the road all night and look at him he is willing his team to a victory here tonight now it s up to the defense to try to hold on and remember doubt red raiders need a field goal they had a 42 yarder kicked by corona who s been handling the kickoffs theyve got 129 and theyve got that one timeout you 1:29 for my fleet by the 6minute for most most offenses 20th time <person player="justin tucker" race="white" position="K">justin</person> sacher will kick it off melissa s back along the <person player="jamar wall" race="UNK" position="DB">wall</person> they expect to return this it s war and he s coming out

up and i seen great acceleration and now we just talked a lot about corporal boy a template goes back to<person player="graham harrell" race="UNK" position="QB">graham harrell</person>and our opens they adhere to the greatest quarterback in college football pulpit i had his moment he took advantage of it now it s back to number six and black gram <person player="graham harrell" race="UNK" position="QB">harrell</person> to see what he can do a lot of people said it might be the last quarterback with the ball and the <person player="john gold" race="UNK" position="P">gold</person> buries his head and ran <person player="graham harrell" race="UNK" position="QB">harrell</person> will see what he can do snaps it off on first down and that s the running back back in slips out lot continues to run did not get the first down one time out texas wants to keep everything in front of them and try to prevent texas tech from getting out of bounds to stop the clock final minute where is that quick pitch over to the banker for the first and 10 that s lewis takes it the midfield now and theyre moving closer and closer to field goal range or corona and the most important thing there is they pick up the first down the clock the game clock will stop giving grant <person player="graham harrell" race="UNK" position="QB">harrell</person> enough time did you think fed up here they didnt have to waste the time out another person time stopping the clock with lewis s reception again almost impossible to stop this backside quarterback that shoulder the corners going down here taking the receivers going to run down the sideline the timing patterns go to the back shoulder perfectly designed there by that context harold and that s a first in ten oclock by britain timing again carol this time going to the other side print you cuts on <person player="edward britton" race="UNK" position="WR">edward</person> group tonight what a big game he s had if that ball is thrown latest an easy play for beasley is throwing on time britain goes up in another big play cant take a sec deflected intercepted texas though they rule it down incomplete i thought for sure that he had deflected it to <person player="blake gideon" race="UNK" position="DB">gideon</person> there s eight ticks of the clock left if texas tech needs to get organized here because the play clock is already started the balls up in the air the true freshman<person player="blake gideon" race="UNK" position="DB">blake gideon</person>brent comes underneath it as realize you work on all the time it goes right
