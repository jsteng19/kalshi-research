============================================================

music anticipation and electricity are back in the owe you a new coach new leaders filled with an all tiny work ethic the pups are here in oklahoma faces its first big test for support sooners of the pass come to mingle with those on the present perfectly prepared to lay it on the line for 30 minutes per day but i dont want anybody one out there thinking that you guys play better than you are capable of playing or that youve got to do something that you havent already done you have the capacity the windows football game and what we have done the magic appears to be back and ready to follow the chief and his sioux nation will be back with colorado and oklahoma next colly memorial stadium norman oklahoma number four colorado in town to take on number ten oklahoma and this has been the hottest ticket around for some time hi everybody ron franklin along with mike gottfried and welcome to saturday night cfa and mike this really surprises me but in talking with the number of the seniors on the ou u squad yesterday this is the first time in their entire career here that they will have played before a capacity house it s been lean times but the point is obviously howard schnellenberger is selling it and theyre buying it well theyre buying that the players are buying it in the crowd on this crowd is electric tonight this is going to be a great atmosphere for this ballgame but youve got to remember hollow rattle in the last five years has been in a lot that gives a lot more big gains atmosphere will be important in my call so what s extremely interesting about this one tonight with all that is on the line between number four and number ten for both teams it is in the hands of extremely young and inexperienced quarterback without a doubt you get oklahoma with the little lefthander<person player="eric moore" race="UNK" position="QB">eric moore</person>he s a redshirt freshman he s very active on the corner and a very good thrower and i expect that theyll run the option with him a little bit tonight on the other side you got<person player="john hessler" race="UNK" position="QB">john hessler</person>who s taking over for the injured boy <person player="koy detmer" race="UNK" position="QB">detmer</person> he had a whole week to practice so youd expect him to be better but i look for rick neuheisel to try to protect him with a good running game with two tight end offense folks what was really interesting last night oh you just went through their walkthrough under the lights here at owens stadium there were 2000 people here just to watch them go through there there are their motions early let s go down to the sidelines mike adamle is there and <person player="michael rose" race="UNK" position="RB">michael</person> that atmosphere is absolutely wonderful isnt it boy it s terrific it makes me want to play again ron you know the two coaches quite a study in contrast you got the venerable sage howard schnellenberger against the young wizard wizard rick neuheisel there is different as night and day but they do share one common bond january 2nd 1984 four new high school it was his greatest day as a college player four touchdown passes that stunned the university of illinois they won at forty five to nine in darren neuheisel <person player="michael rose" race="UNK" position="RB">rose</person> bowl in just a few hours later schnellenberger x greatest moment as a college coach a 3130 victory over nebraska in the orange bowl and a national championship for miami fate has brought them together again tonight gentlemen okay mike thanks very much that is strange that both would win those honors and heckled on the same day and so many years have parted and wind up here in this football game tonight and this is an early game for these two teams as far as what with what they have played in the past rick neuheisel the second youngest coach right now in division one ron cooper of louisville is the only one younger than him and i think were only talking about a few days but it s it s been a transition that that has been very smooth he was the offensive coordinator he was the quarterback coach conference game mike in a hundred 71 games atropine homes and women why because miami was independent because louisville was independent back to last conference game and he played in i think was when he was head coach of the baltimore colts he got fired it is a situation that the men he traveled all over this state in a nineday period they went to over 30 cities he talked to the people he pressed the flesh just like the politician and he said im here to sell you something and it s not a bill of goods get on board this wagon and we gonna try to take it in the right direction tonight i think that s what s so big for them in this ball game mike he s because he wants him took the baby they bought it it s going well but they got to continue running he made a statement this week he said were going to kick colorado to build up his players and give them some confidence that he s out there and every one of the colorado players has that tackle to their locker room to the near side is <person player="herchell troutman" race="UNK" position="RB">troutman</person> that s linda the pin rate to the fire strike her shell <person player="herchell troutman" race="UNK" position="RB">troutman</person> an average of fifteen point seven you can see his long is just under 40 kicks it off and this meeting between colorado and oklahoma is underway out of the game zone so it gives us an opportunity to check the <person player="matt russell" race="UNK" position="LB">russell</person> athletic starting lineups for colorado<person player="john hessler" race="UNK" position="QB">john hessler</person>think about it last week he had about 15 seconds to think about plane now he s had an entire week the wide receivers<person player="rae carruth" race="UNK" position="WR">rae carruth</person>he may be one of the speediest receivers in america some people say he runs under for two and the offensive line this is really an outstanding piece but the man there in the middle <person player="brian lewis" race="UNK" position="P">brian</person> <person player="bryan stoltenberg" race="UNK" position="OL">stoltenberg</person> out of sugarland texas he is an extremely fine one and that s where it all starts right there he not only calls the defensive calls great experience and a very very fine offensive center southland on the first play and a flag comes down she stopped at the line of scrimmage damn live the referee in tonight s ballgame says its motion against oklahoma the starters defensively for the ou s sooners running from the 43<person player="cedric jones" race="UNK" position="DL">cedric jones</person>doesnt say a lot but a lot of people say he is a quiet assassin very fast group of linebackers you will see broad rick <person player="broderick simpson" race="UNK" position="LB">simpson</person> 51 all over the steel tonight he could run with a lot of the running backs and in the secondary some big ones back here late on <person player="maylon wesley" race="UNK" position="DB">wesley</person> has won the job of presentence become one of the real leaders on those defensive team complete near sidelines and james kid and he will be pushed out of bounds at the 32 yard line and just like that or has given up their first first down to colorado what oklahoma has to stop in his colorado offense tonight if you see in the last week s ballgame against am they had over 20 plays of 10 yards or more versus a&amp;m last week says 15 there but there was really 20 plays and they had one drive of 13 plays against texas a&amp;m so their big play offense that oklahoma has to shut down to see the buffaloes in the two tied in a line only one setback and it goes to track them south when not very big at 57 180 but you could see heads go back to speak popped it hard into the line of scrimmage<person player="john hessler" race="UNK" position="QB">john hessler</person>the quarterback tonight two coaches from colorado told me yesterday that he had an excellent week of practice mic some people said well last week ii didnt have much time to think about it now he s had an entire week you kind of take an opposite opinion of that dont you yeah he got more snaps in practice this week so really isnt it better this way and he takes a pretty good shot as he s knocked out of bounds just across the 35 it s britvic way singh who is over there the first sooner to get to him all right i told you these linebackers youll see the quasi <person player="broderick simpson" race="UNK" position="LB">simpson</person> and<person player="tyrell peters" race="UNK" position="LB">tyrell peters</person>and they are all over the field ron going back to what you said about<person player="john hessler" race="UNK" position="QB">john hessler</person>he s been in the program for three years so that s two spring practices so he s had a lot of in this office that s what you expect you back up for that stuff up and let s see if he can come to even vote on this one it s the third day as lynch says he s going to be sacked first time tonight<person player="cedric jones" race="UNK" position="DL">cedric jones</person>the senior on a piece from ammar he s there to wrap him up vic number 57 the quiet assassin and that s what you want here boss clock when youre at home and you want to crowd the ballgame you want a big sack right off the bat <person player="cedric jones" race="UNK" position="DL">cedric</person> jeongu s is that against clint more of the left tackle oklahoma should end up with good field position on singing into the wind dj <person player="pj mills" race="UNK" position="WR">mills</person> back in the deep safety look at the wind hold this part up it is going to hit at the 39 and now takes the colorado bounce and<person player="pj mills" race="UNK" position="WR">pj mills</person>hollers get away from it 33 yards on the kick this is the way the sooners will start with the youngster<person player="eric moore" race="UNK" position="QB">eric moore</person>at quarterback and he s got to get off to a fast start faster that he has the last couple of weeks the wide receivers oklahoma loves their tight ends particularly steven <person player="stephen alexander" race="UNK" position="TE">alexander</person> really fine athlete and good hands and up front this is a veteran offensive line stamped probably the most consistent but mike this is the first time in a year because of injuries that this entire group has been together playing first down in hard by six now seven white shirt colorado buffalo this is the way they start carrie <person player="kerry hicks" race="UNK" position="DL">hicks</person> number 94 mike every time we do them it seems as though he comes up with a big ball game out of salt lake city the linebackers<person player="matt russell" race="UNK" position="LB">matt russell</person>he plays in the middle his teammates say he s simply a madman he s a perfect middle linebacker this is a good group into secondary couple of inexperienced players but now lee a meeting he s mr big play for colorado smells that this is what he does ii think that s the surf ball and send them to something big i think the big factor in this ball game tonight is the conspire against car this goes on the offensive line<person player="eric moore" race="UNK" position="QB">eric moore</person>the lefthander quarterback howard schnellenberger and gary nor do offensive coordinator really like him he s 23 out of 53 two interceptions one touchdown oklahoma with the players shaken up and down at the 46 yard line and you can see more is up checking on<person player="james allen" race="UNK" position="RB">james allen</person>the junior out of wynnewood oklahoma he is the tailback he and more have been they used to share time now theyre in the same backfield but you can see the trainer s are looking at his right ankle we hope that he only stunned it to see the grimmest sometimes you do just stun it it seems bad at first and then after you walk around a little bit it s better chef fraser will come in and he is an extremely good replacement number 19 a junior out of oklahoma city fraser is 61 213 pounds and to see his knowledge and if the average at 72 all coaches would love to have a replacement people are the prokaryotic three good running backs the line of scrimmage and that is<person player="matt russell" race="UNK" position="LB">matt russell</person>the middle linebacker who he just talked about they called him a madman and he before he s perfect for that middle line backing position he loves to put a headgear in there ron im going to repeat it i think the offensive line dhokla hoping it gleams in their hands tonight whether theyre not they can handle this colorado front and run the football that s going to be the key because they want to take pressure off of<person player="eric moore" race="UNK" position="QB">eric moore</person>the young quarterback he lost two yards so it s second down and shows blitzen here they come under pressure alexandr they had singled up on the because of the blitz and it is a first down folks was applying the pressure they brought mike both number 91 just trying to pressure eric worre because it stands right in there finds his tight in steven <person player="stephen alexander" race="UNK" position="TE">alexander</person> for a good game when the new coaching staff came in there at more thought they were going to switching the receiver he went up to see gary northeast and im not a machine but im gonna be a quarterback then he swept he has fought him so far that he is a good quarterback he really has<person player="james allen" race="UNK" position="RB">james allen</person>okay he was back from oh my de mayo clinic colorado sets the blitz again in the run straight ahead at <person player="matt russell" race="UNK" position="LB">russell</person> and<person player="kerry hicks" race="UNK" position="DL">kerry hicks</person>will combine on the stop mike only ask you something last week against texas a&amp;m colorado just blitzed and blitzed and blitzed can they afford to do them in here theyre starting off that way tonight but more it you have to defend him because he can run the football youre right he s the hidden factor because if you blitz<person player="eric moore" race="UNK" position="QB">eric moore</person>and he gets out of that pocket your running man coverage with your second derek worst hit ball big plays and scrambling in his offense what do you do rolling more roll him get him on the outside boy as time gets is tied in well take it to the 31 and mike tirico let s check in with you the first time tonight well ron southern cow is looking to move to to a tow and the pac10 looks like theyll be able to do it brad otten now in a quarterback touchdown to the tight end john allred an 18 yarder usc leading arizona state 16 to nothing mike they may be fortunate that this was their draw this week with these suspensions and all the distractions and you know might that happen so late even happen in too early in the week he would have been tough but it s tough to make adjustments that it happens look at the lip sometimes your prayers rise to a different level when something like that happens blitz you can but it should not get good when half the first down as rasca comes up to make the tackle and it was <person player="gerald williams" race="UNK" position="WR">gerald</person> more number 7 who pancake the defensive play watching tape today on oklahoma <person player="gerald williams" race="UNK" position="WR">gerald</person> nor is the complete back good block as a fullback he s a good solid runner has great hands out of the backfield before this game s over youre gonna see number seven <person player="gerald williams" race="UNK" position="WR">gerald</person> moore was some big catches but he s got the whole package run with his<person player="greg jones" race="UNK" position="DL">greg jones</person>that he was blocking on so the sooners move the chains we had no score about to go into nine minutes this opening quarter and the running the quickness of the pursuit of colorado more tries to turn the corner but he cant get it done and it s <person player="ron merkerson" race="UNK" position="LB">merkerson</person> who comes over to make the hit you talked about colorado they made a complete switch on defense now theyre more of a blitzing team there were 50 defense last year five down now there are four three team and theyve really kind of gone to the nebraska philosophy hey were going to heat you up sic them penetrate all that so it s a different style of defense under rick neuheisel mike more and more teams are getting away from they from the lead defenses wont that speed on the field attack to be 11 yard and finally to put a stuff out of him at the 75,000 partisans really like it were all here is mostyn doubt more here so that leaves just one line back from the box really as safety is going to have to end up making this play on<person player="james allen" race="UNK" position="RB">james allen</person>there s just nobody in the middle of field good call by gary norton chickens boy of the tribe coming as he takes it at right guard and darrell <person player="daryl price" race="UNK" position="DL">price</person> wraps him up the other big question for colorado us tonight that came off a very emotional am game but when you have backtoback games like this oklahoma s been pumped to this game theyve hit they had san diego state smu in north texas they really havent played the opponents of colorado has played so it s a second down if you just joined us picked up one first down but had to kick it away and now the sooners on an extended drive with a second down inside the 10<person player="james allen" race="UNK" position="RB">james allen</person>maybe has one in carry hips he s holding on to him now third down they can pick up the first down at the 1 mike do you continue to hammer away at this tuck run defense or do you put it off this time this is where i would expect<person player="eric moore" race="UNK" position="QB">eric moore</person>on some type of role maybe an obscene play or some type of rollout on the playaction where he has a run past capabilities and they like theyre tight in so the tight end is a big play type receiver <person player="stephen alexander" race="UNK" position="TE">stephen</person> in <person player="stephen alexander" race="UNK" position="TE">alexander</person> in their situation i think that s who id look for number eight headed for the corner and even as fast as moore is look how many white church were out there to honey about about well that s the roll out that s the run past theory that youve got<person player="matt russell" race="UNK" position="LB">matt russell</person>number 16 was able to knock him outside no fake at all on this place theyve got to run past possibility and you see<person player="pj mills" race="UNK" position="WR">pj mills</person>is wide open in the back of the end zone they just didnt see<person player="pj mills" race="UNK" position="WR">pj mills</person>they missed that one ron he s wide open that s a touchdown for oklahoma that did does that get because everything did not see the field jeremy <person player="stephen

should say on espn2 sighs <person player="baron tanner" race="UNK" position="DL">tanner</person> and malin <person player="maylon wesley" race="UNK" position="DB">wesley</person> combining in the stop and oklahoma s trying to do because of the great running game that colorado has is they were trying to move our defensive ends in a little bit inside the tight end but theyre getting sealed a little bit but that s what oklahoma wants the ball to bounce to the linebacker team gets sealed but the linebackers are not there to make the play second down the line to make for colorado just two inside the owe you 13 shopping for the game : early in this scheme run it is something that s very obvious is that oklahoma s defensive backs are really concerned about the speed of colorado s receivers theyre way off of them and that s why theyve been open with the short passing the outs and so but they really fear their speed on the outside and that s what jim hester has to take advantage of the quick and <person player="phil savoy" race="UNK" position="WR">savoy</person> and davison kid because theyre there theyve got the cushion a good cover guys for had an interception last week s game against the university of north texas it is third down <person player="rae carruth" race="UNK" position="WR">carruth</person> is the man that he wanted darius <person player="darrius johnson" race="UNK" position="DB">johnson</person> had the cover and field goal team who come on which means neo bhaskar rich ian the senior of arcadia california master richie and six of seven as longest is 46 yards this ball is going to be placed down at the 27 3,700 attempts plenty of distance and he is no so let s take a break 1:56 left opening quarter treating up in suitors now this was just a couple of moments ago as heisler talking to his head coach on the sidelines some instruction as far as that last series this concern and what it appeared to me is that john hester was saying hey i was high with the ball i mean i had him there and were gonna be okay and that s what rick neuheisel time he they got some cushions on the outside the advantage of <person player="terence brown" race="UNK" position="WR">brown</person> in the game at wide receiver he s at the top of your screen as as soon as gil from the shotgun gonna go on top of it she s looking for god in oakland and over to terrence <person player="terence brown" race="UNK" position="WR">brown</person> i had be broken open the terrence <person player="terence brown" race="UNK" position="WR">brown</person> is last year s quarterback he said i dont want any part of that quarterback this year put me at wide receiver and eric or what did gary gordon said now ive heard this rumor about me going to wide receiver i dont want any part of that i want to be the quarterback more three or four 34 yards his first incomplete pass so both quarterbacks started off with it to the very warm hand tonight all in the audible you see the linebackers in the middle come on see the complete in pity really took a shot from rasca after the ball went by him sometimes you can fade a young quarterback into something and i think that s what colorado was able to do fade him into another long throw <person player="steve rosga" race="UNK" position="DB">steve</person> nebraska the safety just sitting back here on the hash they baited him with the stunt but no one s come and see sometimes dont blind backers a good up fair like theyre gonna blitz and bail out of there i think they talked derek moore into a bad play well it s a third down now they need to pick up tenyard you need to go to the 30 the middle screen and it is too low picha eight <person player="pj mills" race="UNK" position="WR">mills</person> is the man they were looking for and then it came clean and that s something now that if youre colorado s defensive coaches you know youre able to come through on that boots that clean you want to still continue to heat him up you see how they come through clean even though it s a screen<person player="matt russell" race="UNK" position="LB">matt russell</person>came through to untouched how to expect more boots and out of colorado as this game goes on ryan <person player="brian lewis" race="UNK" position="P">lewis</person> to kick it away game to rostov to the 27 one two three flags coming from downfield that s a 53 here at boot nine on to return wendell davis was there to make the tackle and special teams in the back table against the buffalo break3 nothing oklahoma leading over colorado well be right back oklahoma three to nothing with only 132 left in this opening quarter and there s only been one quarter this year that the buffaloes have not scored points in pacifica take advantage of the outside run because they definitely have two wide receivers that s what takes it s a trap minister on it involves two caca get the complete that s right for ruth dj darius <person player="darrius johnson" race="UNK" position="DB">johnson</person> was there to make the hit on him after a gain of five here s what youre looking at on the outside<person player="rae carruth" race="UNK" position="WR">rae carruth</person>with the coverage and the cushion on the outside that s<person player="larry bush" race="UNK" position="DB">larry bush</person>number 31 just backing out into late coming up is darius <person player="darrius johnson" race="UNK" position="DB">johnson</person> on the hip that s out there for colorado whoops his ovitz a sooners darius <person player="darrius johnson" race="UNK" position="DB">johnson</person> and maybe shaken up a little bit there getting him off the field and they got a replacement in and the whistle is blown and the stoppage in play but no timeout was charged later massaging that arm it looks as though he might have got the stinger at the arm was window davis to the 28 comes in replacing me the action in the pitch back to chocolate oh my goodness marquise <person player="martin chase" race="UNK" position="DL">chase</person> numbered 93 the sophomore at a loss right there to make the hip tip type <person player="tyrell peters" race="UNK" position="LB">peters</person> was there also ron and he was suspended that s number 45 he was suspended last week as you seen that for us defense only 507 theyre giving up the game average then when youre suspended when you dont play the game in saturday for howard schnellenberger you play on the toilet bowl on monday with all the guys who dont play in the game they nickname a dead bowl and they made their starter play in that game last week he played in place all the coaches were just crossing their fingers and hope that he got out of that healthy well in that opening quarter oh you held colorado to ten rushes and 20 yards three to nothing well be right back to norman with more some of the capacity crowd here in norman oklahoma tonight over 75,000 strong out to see this one first time ive had a son out here since 1989 and these are the numbers on the first quarter as we said colorado 20 and even first perceptual misdeal voted and he lobs it and over trials mixes good heavens boy he had him and he was being team he was not to himself as he couldve run that goal that s the straight to john hester oh he has good mobility and he can get out of the pocket and he made that play

thomas</person>so they arent experienced in subject jones is taking advantage of that sailors said being called i believe by comical yes colorado is calling the timeout as <person player="john hessler" race="UNK" position="QB">hessler</person> had come over to the near sideline well take another ten to nothing tonight oklahoma leads with 9 minutes in 23 seconds left to play until the halftime like the fumble just a moment ago gave cu the ball at the 17yard game they have not been able to take advantage of bid opportunities tonight on the last series the 41 yard kickoff return we didnt get anything out of it here they gotta get caught some time roma s defense it runs so well on defense they can make good clothes kessler complete at the 19yard line and then shut just be patient on the outside jeans kids with the tenyard completion here looks like oklahoma so concerned about the colorado speed on the outside so now it comes down to a third down and they still need to eat 11 yards to pick up the first down theyve got to take it down inside the ou8 jutsus fusion in that huddle you could see <person player="melvin thomas" race="UNK" position="OL">thomas</person> maoli <person player="bryan stoltenberg" race="UNK" position="OL">stoltenberg</person> is gonna call a timeout that s a problem sometimes when you send verbose it goes in sometimes hed get it mixed up and you guys spend the time off shoulder go to take it with him 916 left until the halftime well be right back so 10 to nothing colorado still with the third down and about the 11 and half on his 12 yards to pick up the first down and theyve had to call a timeout because the play that came in there was confusion cb got it worked out third down conversions tonight aspyn s in motion nasa to the middle either spots aboard touchdown that s what<person player="john hessler" race="UNK" position="QB">john hessler</person>needs in this ballgame around the completion like that to get back started again but now colorado is going to be called for a 15yard penalty for too much celebration clint moore number 66 at left tackle did a really good job on<person player="cedric jones" race="UNK" position="DL">cedric jones</person>that time to make sure his young quarterback had time to get the pass away once standing on the side <person player="gerald williams" race="UNK" position="WR">williams</person> but this game is just absolutely going down a real steep hill there for a bit and all of a sudden mike that the last minute on the clock has just has taken 20 minutes to play i like what colorado s doing offensively i really feel like theyve got a pretty good game plan in this game just have not executed early have some things opening the passing game john lurie has called his officials together mike what could they possibly be talking about there four flags down in the end zone well what john was saying if you can read his lips unsportsmanlike called against colorado and it will be stepped off on the kickoff and that s where the benefit of the wind that youre back when the kickoff show for sure howard howard just summed up the situation for us is it anybody know what the hell s going on and he s exactly right were asking the same question i think they give them their choice dont they yes they do give them their choice that might be the holdup colorado was able to force the turnover turn it into points theyve elected to take this on sports the right here well i did see a personal foul call maybe that will be assessed on the kickoff courtesy i was commenting to you today about the games ive watched i do not see the celebration thing called as much as i saw early in the season okay were going to show you a couple of things after the extra point attempt here might fit that may kind of sum up why the flag were thrown pastor rich ian to attempt an extra point 35 yards plenty of distance and he s got it so it s tim seven now back and surely the touchdown but protection here<person player="phil savoy" race="UNK" position="WR">phil savoy</person>with a catch i must check<person player="john hessler" race="UNK" position="QB">john hessler</person>after the touchdown that s the only thing we can figure is that the <person player="john hessler" race="UNK" position="QB">hessler</person> celebration and that s when the flags were thrown need to take that flag was gone now well see if the personal firewalls espn is your home for college football again next saturday at 11:30 it all starts with college gameday and 12:30 michigan takes on northwestern at 3:30 and 7:00 catch up on all the scores and highlights and at 7:30 see if miami can slow down the florida state seminoles at 10:30 we put a period on the day all of that next saturday so to repeat the sequence that occurred 15yard penalty they stepped it off the extra point attempt had to come from the 25 which made it the 35 yard attempt in the bus collision knocked at home so we have a 10 7 ballgame and there was not a personal foul call more waiting on the sidelines as<person player="pj mills" race="UNK" position="WR">pj mills</person>lashes texas well take it off

first time then you got it total more than the ground stop the clock and give you a player to to be able to throw into the end zone this changes the whole theory of the thing without a timeout now you got very nice good clock management i shall just did they not only discuss this play that the war is theyve got a couple plays going here to pick up the first down in there ready ii think this be accorded that sneaked in to tight ends to wide receivers and<person player="marlon barnes" race="UNK" position="RB">marlon barnes</person>the only setback much but i think he got it now they need to get set again and be ready to go in the next play whistle far away oh we wouldnt need some carrier pigeon you tell us where they made it or not this this is now the highest press box ive ever done a game in and i have to say the most unique experience is ive never seen the topical pump before and here s where we are see those speakers who are those lights are at the very middle of that a georgia pine say they got the first down at his first stint in colorado with 26 now 25 seconds to clock is running sex to throw in for the touchdown still in the first playoff to the first time this good job an offensive coordinator cloud over our taking the first down they had the second play already up there and there s still 17 seconds to go on the clock and mike that drives going to be like 71 yards that was very very baskar idiom with the extra point he s right down the middle so 17 seconds left until halftime it is 17 to 14<person player="rae carruth" race="UNK" position="WR">rae carruth</person>number 21 just for the corner rob<person player="john hessler" race="UNK" position="QB">john hessler</person>quit quit presents in the pocket good protection by the offensive line given the time and<person player="rae carruth" race="UNK" position="WR">rae carruth</person>beaten number 17<person player="rod henderson" race="UNK" position="DB">rod henderson</person>for the touchdown it s been a good first half boy has it ever rick neuheisel happy with that call and you know mike to saying i think the point that we need to make on both sides of the line as young john is being congratulated at over here and on the other side of the field were talking about they have not played major college football both teams undefeated in in front of the village for 10 days not it s 75 thousand folks at they havent acted like they even know that this other stuffs going on well rick neuheisel had a good point he said i was always a backup quarterback for a long time in ucla and homer smith who was the quarterback coach explained to him he said you always have to be ready so you have to prepare yourself mentally even though youre not getting as many snaps and practice prepare yourself mentally john hester has done that he s ready to go molested five yards deep into the endzone mike tirico in talking about backup quarterbacks georgia lost mike bobo their starter having to turn to former tailback and wide receiver hines ward today tough to make that start against the alabama defense which scored 21 points including this <person player="cedric jones" race="UNK" position="DL">cedric</person> samuel touchdown bama shutout the dollar s mike ill tell you what if you got as many raises in your life as positions hines ward s had to play at georgia youd really be a rich guy he s played like six different positions wide receiver quarterback tailback they had used to commit everything down to georgia numbers on a thursday at 14 appointed 140 yards and two touchdowns 17 to 14 oklahoma leading over the colorado buffaloes is were here at halftime and mike off the top of the telecast we talked about the two young quarterbacks what kind of grades would you give them for the first day of a play i give them both a name because i think both of made big plays in the first half fair ignore here of the past along <person player="jajuan penny" race="UNK" position="WR">penny</person> for the touchdown come right back with the other side<person player="john hessler" race="UNK" position="QB">john hessler</person>with his touchdown pass to<person player="rae carruth" race="UNK" position="WR">rae carruth</person>both the pat big half and they really oklahoma s had a better running game so theyve benefited erik nor more than john hester s running game of colorado but colorado started to get a little success in winning game there in the second quarter you and i talked during the halftime as you look at<person player="pj mills" race="UNK" position="WR">pj mills</person>who is the deep man for the sooners we felt as though that maybe <person player="john hessler" race="UNK" position="QB">hessler</person> was kind of getting into the rhythm of the game more than in the first quarter i see more things open for him than i really do for erik lora jason leslie the six yard line and let s check in with mike adamle who s with a special guest mike hawaii the numbers for<person player="john hessler" race="UNK" position="QB">john hessler</person>14 of 22 touchdown passes looks like he s finally settled down a little bit i think he is you know he s just got to get in this rhythm and i think he did write 30 in the second half into the first half you know he hit that touchdown pass and you know he told me he felt real good about things so i know you guys one of the reasons why you made the 66 man travel roster is to room with him on the road and and to be with him on the sidelines what kind of things did you discuss last night in at halftime where i just told him to settle down and take this time out there you know if he feels pressure to get out of there and make something big happen notice you had two shoulder pads on in the knee brace on i feel great you know they want to take it slow and dont want to get swelling in there so ive gotta wait for them boy thanks a lot good luck in the second half coy death mary as you look at the hester on the sidelines 140 yards and two touchdowns oklahoma keeping the ball on the ground as they open the second half of play and it is going to be a second down and short and an injured player is<person player="james allen" race="UNK" position="RB">james allen</person>the junior at a wynnewood oklahoma he was shaken up early on in the contest and 19<person player="jeff

turned into a touchdown oklahoma truly played very disciplined on offense tonight their offensive line which i thought was a question mark coming into this game real he s played well against this front of colorado and theyve been able to control the ball on the ground and control the clock as he looks up and sees colorado showing breath here they come and theyll try to take the night progresses it and he s been a turn make the stop the ball has come loose but they say it is dead at the 38yard line of mike let s take a look at the first half stats and what kind of story do you see here well again i think the fact of colorado when you look at the rushing yards only 32 rushing yards this is a team that three times this year s had 200 plus rushing yards in 200 plus passing yards in the same game so theyve got to find an answer there to run the football theyve not been able to get the big play against this oklahoma defense yet the fraser almost caught for a loss he winds up with a gain of four shorts off this time gets it beside the break off the tackle but couldnt get away from <person player="kenny wilkins" race="UNK" position="DB">kenny</person> wolf class that was a good tackle by <person player="kenny wilkins" race="UNK" position="DB">kenny</person> weapons threestep drop by eric more you like to throw that quick passing game especially when teams are blitzing on you because you know they can pick up the blitz and youre going to get the ball off before they get to the quarterback football game mcgarry nerd who has a hundred ten people here tonight from kentucky has spent $1300 on tickets tonight not that many take another attempt that s a fast third down and short the line to make is the 45 and coming back into the boundary with i think he got it

the yankees win the wild card seattle does not clinch the west on their own thus far tonight one of these two teams is going to get a big play and it s going to change the course of this football game theyve had some big play opportunities just have not been able to advantage and the second down play this is <person player="gerald williams" race="UNK" position="WR">gerald</person> moore who will

good acceleration mike which gives him an added weapon with that body that stocky body that lot of backs dont hand youd like to get the ball to him in the passing game because he is really that s a great hand blitz coming right up the middle moore has time to get it away but that s what the pressure forced him to do threw it too quickly and it was<person player="kerry hicks" race="UNK" position="DL">kerry hicks</person>who was all over gary <person player="kerry hicks" race="UNK" position="DL">hicks</person> the player last week that blocked the am field oh he kept the score of 21

which was which was diamonds let s see if<person player="brian lewis" race="UNK" position="P">brian lewis</person>can get this one away and everybody picks up their man finish her up the middle and ill tell you im not sure that southward didnt get a piece of this room huge cheer from the crowd as this one is going to go inside the 30yard line so they wind up with a 51yard boot time out on the field let s take it with it well be right back oklahoma 17 to 14 and mike what in the world is going on on specialty well first of all 10 men rush your center is not going to block anybody now this is southward again he s going to come through were going to watch him come through and well stop it here in a second ill show you what the problem is stop it right here that s the personal protector now number 27 colin southward ray if colin that rosenberg he just misses the block and now you got another possibility of a kickback he didnt get to it i get to it but most but he forced him to get away a very high a short kick but they got a good bounce the setback by that oh you defense <person player="broderick simpson" race="UNK" position="LB">simpson</person> along with<person player="martin chase" race="UNK" position="DL">martin chase</person>combining to stopping slow development plays against this oklahoma defencing forget about it because theyve learned to well they recover they get

called that these three really solid backers it can run they did lose yard so it s going to be second down is out at the 40 yes the pencil over the middle oh janice kalu and remember he stands rise nobody s gonna touch him in colorado some people say he s under court now senator here s somebody s going to get a big to take over this football 71yard caruth to cut that touchdown pass he s a running back in high school in colorado under bill mccartney recruited a lot of running backs and then moved him to wide receiver this is<person player="rae carruth" race="UNK" position="WR">rae carruth</person>runs under a for 314 you like you said ron ron <person player="rod henderson" race="UNK" position="DB">henderson</person> you forget it strike up the band because youre not going to catch him 71 yards and just like that the buffaloes have gone on time bus to richmond to attempt the extra point he s got it so well take a break 7:54 left in the third quarter and all of a sudden the buffaloes are warming up here s your wakeup call nature lover in fact it works like this now for under 16 thousands get a classic jeep cherokee with 190 horsepower so charge air one the link

in the night the buffaloes are leading look at the scoring drive two plays 69 yards 48 seconds is what they need it that s a big play offense at colorado they gets in that too tight game and they run the football and theyve got so much speed on the outside theyre always capable of hitting it with that big play jason leslie from palacios texas will kick it off transferred in from ucla and they use him specifically for for kickoffs not under this one kicking into the windmills on the garden tune with my cat amis got more on peru my rotten wife we always have known that the buffaloes possess great team speed we just found out why race ruth is the fastest of the buffaloes but this past spring indoors several pro scouts watch here he runs a legit for 240 what s really amazing about rea is that he s a guy who can do it with a pair of shoulder pads on an inhale at filling time you see compete as football players the right guru can like i think youd get a total endorsement from that oh you secondary after that last play at 71 yards bitch name at the top the miracle alamin now this fellow out of defense is aroused after that long touchdown theyve kind of taken control of this football game just before half when they made that play that fourth and one the quarterback sneak then threw the touchdown pass they have had control since that point blocked nor has to find the answer now biggest thing that theyve done also mike they have taken this partisan crowd out of the ballgame for the moment by murchison he is going to be sack that i had to wait for a moment i thought that he grabbed him by the facemask we know the tackle they doing so much flips it inside to see number 33 ron murchison just come through free<person player="james allen" race="UNK" position="RB">james allen</person>tried to block him but that angles too tough<person player="james allen" race="UNK" position="RB">james allen</person>giri s lined up he cant get to ron murchison

cunningham</person>was a receiver last year as an excellent tackler at ou jay kristoff the defensive coordinators brought this blitzing style of defense howard schnellenberger seen a lot of this in his past so he knows he gotta find some answers<person player="tj cunningham" race="UNK" position="DB">tj cunningham</person>good cockroach see if they solve this protection problem they have tinman

right now start hammering away at this defense oklahoma a third tailback on the night for colorado is lyndon huey a sophomore from port <person player="arthur atkins" race="UNK" position="DL">arthur</person> texas number 39 checks into the backfield who gets to handle three maybe four des quasi puts the stop on hand kurt van valkenburg a defensive coordinator for howard schnellenberger is doing a nice job it hits the run maybe telling us he tackles what s a little bit more in the side angle and slant and all night out of those two defensive tackles produce defense has had to play a lot in the last quarter they need a big play right here though colorado s big closed seven big plays in this game that s what you have to shut down and he shut down colorado the rolls of pocket throws the completion to <person player="tennyson mccarty" race="UNK" position="TE">mccarty</person> but the hit is made of mmediately it s going to be third down and long for c use man coverage by oklahoma so they were right on the tight end<person player="tennyson mccarty" race="UNK" position="TE">tennyson mccarty</person>17 as were about to go into five minutes to play third quarter home asking their defense given the stop right here is complete perusal again that s going to be enough for the colorado first down at the oklahoma 44 when you ensure oklahoma knows how fast recruit is also and youre just going to see the big cushion again on the side where<person player="rae carruth" race="UNK" position="WR">rae carruth</person>is on corners bailing out strong safety working inside the rake ruth coming from that inside receiver gets darius <person player="darrius johnson" race="UNK" position="DB">johnson</person> just not able to covering suppose who wanted and tsuboi got turned around<person player="larry bush" race="UNK" position="DB">larry bush</person>was the closest man to it and mike tirico let s check back with you bran colorado s one of 15 division one a schools to have to go to a backup quarterback because of injury ucla s in that mix cade mcnown is 11 of 12 tonight including this touchdown pass to jim mcelroy neuheisel zama mata is up 17 like ive never seen so many lefthanded quarterbacks all of a sudden <person player="kenny wilkins" race="UNK" position="DB">kenny</person> stabler he started all this second down them to glados trilogy oklahoma 44 twice have gotten to him and it s<person player="cedric jones" race="UNK" position="DL">cedric jones</person>in the country because he cos good against the run and he s good in past rush number 57 working on an inside mood clinton more just gave him up he thought he s going to get some help from the guard but he didnt get any help but something johnny helped himself to<person player="john hessler" race="UNK" position="QB">john hessler</person>boy now that was big there im telling you it it is now a third down and 20 as you look at six tackles six hurries in two sacks and east of the law screaming back to the near side of the field theyve got blockers in front and hillary finally run out of bounds at the 22 yard line boy did they catch oklahoma in the right defense so what they were doing is that theyve had long yardage situation and they know that number 57 is going to put his ears back and come so what is the best way to handle the pass rush is just run a screen pass get your guard out in front working working let him come on in and now get the screen to london good blocking heathrow and <person player="brian lewis" race="UNK" position="P">brian</person> s thornton burst open burg just absolutely destroyed the defensive player a special a good car southland is back in the ball game and he s going to take it for a gain of about four maybe five i talked about this earlier when youve been in as many big games as this ballclub has under bill mccarthy partly for the last four years at the fifth year seniors are three years if youre a senior and now under rick neuheisel you get used to plan these kind of games theyre scheduled this year they played four ranked teams in the first five games so theyre used to these big nights and he s going to battle here comes a late flag in as he goes inside the 15 <person player="tyrell peters" race="UNK" position="LB">peters</person> made the stop on so the buffalo express gets derailed for a moment as holding is called on colorado cut the conversation with rick neuheisel when he city down to visit <person player="steve rosga" race="UNK" position="DB">steve</person> spurrier talked a little bit about how he was going to be able to handle being a head coach but he also wanted to still be the quarterback coach and he wanted to find out how <person player="steve rosga" race="UNK" position="DB">steve</person> kerr s spent his time which is good move for him thought the other thing invested within last night and asking him about his youth and and was he going to kind of go against the grain as far as some habits the older coaches had and his statement he made to do those no is that i wont focus discipline intensity all that stuff but also want my kids to have fun so far 50 hi that s a good way to be yet over the middle were almost intercepted <person player="anthony fogle" race="UNK" position="DB">anthony</person> vogel is the man who tipped the hassle rated product the offensive coordinator had the perfect defense on for this play he s got a<person player="anthony fogle" race="UNK" position="DB">anthony fogle</person>sitting in center field in the interception he just didnt make the interception for howard schnellenberger his victory down the middle of the field so boy but number nine <person player="anthony fogle" race="UNK" position="DB">anthony</person> foucault s got this interception he needs to make this play cant guilt colorado too many chances now you have the interception you drop the ball it is stirred down in 16 and he breaks the taco hey and now there is a late flag in the endzone our conversation today about the celebration control look back at this tape and he s going to look at a lot of different things this boyd and his team is not quite where colorado is and then again the big play a big game philosophy of colorado is paying off right not a third quarter but theyre not making the plays and when you miss an interception like that give a football club one more shot theyre going to hurt you guard said on thursday afternoon during the practice that you know he said work were still distance away but this is our first big test but he said id rather play early than i had late because were gonna get better with every ball game baskar incheon knocks home the extra point and as we go to break let s take one more look were going to stay here and and what a great individual effort by lyndon <person player="lendon henry" race="UNK" position="RB">henry</person> it was a good safe called<person player="melvin thomas" race="UNK" position="OL">melvin thomas</person>the right tackle the inexperienced tackle you gonna see him out there he gets the block on<person player="broderick simpson" race="UNK" position="LB">broderick simpson</person>now the other blocks now the cutback by land and <person player="lendon henry" race="UNK" position="RB">henry</person> there s the missed tackle by<person player="larry bush" race="UNK" position="DB">larry bush</person>and it s into the end zone and the nails are coming out again into the coffin of oklahoma missed block there missed tackle by malin <person player="maylon wesley" race="UNK" position="DB">wesley</person> there s another one wendell davis number 28 you cant miss all those tackles by the way you could see 65 krishna olie downfield their offensive lineman it s particularly bourbon <person player="bryan stoltenberg" race="UNK" position="OL">stoltenberg</person> and nioh lead the two guards in the topic they are devastating down field mike they dont miss and howard s upset because he knows that he s got this crowd in here tonight and and he really has kind of played to pied piper and he went and really the reason he did that was to his pleasure some confidence because he felt like theyve been beaten down the last few years barry switzer years here what a hard wilson right there is lockup dont just hit people but lock up on the top sixtyfive most of the week because the internet came back the night really playing a good solid game for the buffaloes so jason leslie will well kick it off for colorado and another 15yard penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct 28 to 17 conewago by 11 the nature all is touched for the up man at the 30 and take it out to the 39 yard line so the sooners will have good field position to open this drive nataly mike you know howard schnellenberger came to norman to bring this new donation as he likes to call a national championship one day so does this game maple were in a development process this is not a national championship game for us what this is for us is a very big and important midterm exam for this new football team that s taking football 101 right now a win now would tell us that we passed the exam to this point and that s what we have to look at it you cant ever say that you cant circle the way against the fourth game of the year on say this is this is it even though you got all the crowd pumped up you know he s got to keep improving this program 6 and 6 record last year just trying to get better so it s going to be second down i like this thing who says sooner nation he s rallying a super nation were here alarms thank you is tied in and plus to the first down as he s wrestled out by liam eating it s been impressive tonight it s a tight end spot leading receiver on this oklahoma team good throw again by eric more to steven <person player="stephen alexander" race="UNK" position="TE">alexander</person> just a flat route makes the catch denali a meeting with the tackle well i asked eric more about steven <person player="stephen alexander" race="UNK" position="TE">alexander</person> i said i i get the feeling youre kind of partial to him and he admitted he said he catches everything in surrounding bundle the snap on the third down and short righto signalling that they have it look like err ignore pulled out too fast and you see the fists go up so that means forth down it means that oklahoma has retained possession and there the challenge to his offensive line right here fourth and one and with 1:15 left in this third quarter miami in florida state perhaps the fiercest rivalry in america miami may be down but it will make their season to knock off their hated foe the florida state no less than the national championship is on the line next

knows it s going to be a patient test he just wants to have the same fire and his players that he asked he is pacing that sideline like a caged lion aright he wants it to be infectious the 14yard we want to see how involved he is in the ball game this is stella burger on that last play just just inches just inches and of course he s throwing with the win at both quarterbacks when they put air under the ball going in this direction have overthrown just by inches listen they hit him with a drunk but if he gets by that wave right there there s a lot of running room for more clock is running with 33 now 32 seconds left in this third quarter the buffalo is down 10 to nothing and then down 17 to 7 in the first half now up by 11 points 28 17 why and there s going to be picked off by liam eating and with that the end of the third quarter with our score colorado 28 and oklahoma 17 were about to be freddie first what s in the bag mcdonald s juicy quarter pounder with cheese two for two

oklahoma with a fourth down and a punting situation snap it is 30 years now nerado s got to return on this time wobbly kick into the wind and by rasca at the 14 yard line garrett peggy we havent seen him tonight he s the backup quarterback for oklahoma but he watched him just a moment ago mike really trying to fire up the troops on the sidelines well he s the senior and you like to see that because even though he s not in the ball game you still expect your seniors to lead little reminder every 10 30 and 50 minutes after the hour you spend updating you on all the scores things going on in the world of sports a tailback for the buffaloes he gets it cave hole to the right side and he is very close to the gain of ten yards as tyrone <person player="tyrell peters" race="UNK" position="LB">peters</person> will wrap him up sometimes your passing game has to be used to open up your running game and now colorado been successful through on the football now im going to turn to the run by the way you make a good point so good that hester s fourth touchdown passes tonight that ties at colorado record kordell stewart and also coy <person player="koy detmer" race="UNK" position="QB">detmer</person> hyde also with four touchdown passes in the ballgame there s coy on the sideline i hope he doesnt try to come back too soon and injure himself so that that he ends any possibility of plans to talk to jerry punch jerry punch talk to their doctor the other day and they felt like he was going to be okay not a lot of swelling and they thought he had good movement make a good decision on that <person player="lendon henry" race="UNK" position="RB">henry</person> puts a head down you could hear the pop up here <person player="tyrell peters" race="UNK" position="LB">peters</person> and<person player="rod manuel" race="UNK" position="DL">rod manuel</person>combine to make the stop on him what kind of balance if the buffaloes had tonight this is what it looks like 284 and rushing only 31 yards in oklahoma s only really given up an average of 50 in the first three games but theyve been the passing team san diego state smu north texas state the boy makes the catch at the 30 and is being pushed back the line to being a gain of four is <person player="larry bush" race="UNK" position="DB">bush</person> and<person player="broderick simpson" race="UNK" position="LB">broderick simpson</person>combined to make the tackle the other thing about the colorado court of actually do not throw a lot of interceptions they dont make a lot of mistakes they know where theyre going the football that s attention to detail as you see coy getting roof laid down in mission texas there s father they know where theyre going with the footballs now they guess for them laughs tolling under 13 minutes left to play in this one and the buffaloes would love to have about a seven or eight minute drive right here didnt get the playoff though this one s gonna cost him five as the whistles are now being blown it is said of a second down at about five it s going to be second down and ten most since his arrival of 94 it thrown only five interceptions mic to back up your point at 434 attempts and you look at<person player="john hessler" race="UNK" position="QB">john hessler</person>coming into this season into the am game he only 215 passes from colorado so all of a sudden it takes only a em game here tonight he s going for four touchdown passes again attention to detail sure looks like were having trouble with the 25 second clock it was showing zero so john lurie has to go over behind the bench and so were going to be held up here for just a second as they try to get that problem rectified and let s check in with mike tirico again mike ron and baseball simple of california loses the yankees in seattle are in the playoffs down 31 chili davis a threerun homer that put california ahead believe that theyve extended now a 53 the

apakah city he will have been not the little silly jones will tip it back to the 45yard frustration you cant make again those mistakes look like a loose snap to grant immunity never choose to handle turnovers you see colorado with zero and howard schnellenberger is ballclub just coughing up a fourth and to situation check the snap out to<person player="garrick mcgee" race="UNK" position="QB">garrick mcgee</person>which had never got back<person player="chuck langston" race="UNK" position="OL">chuck langston</person>hit him in the foot sure did he hit him right the big

good afternoon with<person player="tyrell peters" race="UNK" position="LB">tyrell peters</person>number 45 the junior out of norman rice their bank the stop talking to the coaches yeah they they said sometimes<person player="tyrell peters" race="UNK" position="LB">tyrell peters</person>register run around blocks of course you dont want people to run around blocks and they were watching film one day and they tony said you keep running around box you cant make the play and then all of a sudden made to play they said well the next time you wont be able to make the play they ran around that block and just need to play again some guys just have great ability to get to the football several past otaku and he really gets waxed by sterling lucky and a little bunch of other sooners came in to help out after that smike oklahoma comes back on up and come back with jerry matheny come back with eric more than the the freshman or thank you go with derek <person player="garrick mcgee" race="UNK" position="QB">mcgee</person> again he had him on a little bit of a run that left us malachite instant you place the colorado and the passing game bear down and they need the 47 yard line they get it complete in the near sideline for ruth and pollutes going to have the first down +8 get on the outside the big cushion by oklahoma rake routes as you seen come off the ball 31<person player="larry bush" race="UNK" position="DB">larry bush</person>just gives him a lot really turns and starts to run and again that s the threat of that speed that s what speed will do to you on the outside your corners any eleven knives on five reception pretty good ratio there as far as yardage right tracking straight ahead hell have three peter stop seaman right now colorado s interested in is just running that clock gun down mike adamle let s check with you well three of us were down here at practice last night when colorado was walking through and i think teams in a lot of respects are reflecting in their coaches and rick neuheisel made a point of saying that he believes that football should be fun this is a place for discipline couple of weeks ago was snowing in boulder a lot of freshmen on his team and never seen snow before so he called the timeout in practice he said guys go for it and a big snowball moment and as for touchdown pass magnusson it s romantic he could have built this program he really did he took it when they were really down and people got on him a little bit early and bill moreau to a he stayed waiting me to bill the program even though they lost all those players to the draft last year this is still a solid program the rick neuheisel doing a great job with it well theyre trying to get one more blocking back on this with roscoe he s coming on late and oscar etsion gets it and let s take a break 7:46 left in our ballgame it is the buffalo is it team sevensix caitlin blackboard announces an amazing closeout event one lift off its cable blackboard 72 hour clearance countdown every new 95 must be sold hope until midnight friday and saturday low clearance prices marked on every new 95 ford save up to $5,500 catelynn blackboard 72 our clearance countdown highway 436 6 miles west of i4 apopka it s out of this world im from utopia texas oh cowboys where s the cowboy ahead with the saturn i can get in it with my hat on and im comfortable and still got ancient hats played without a rubber on top which means a whole lot to me i dont like playing by to see my bald head son keep my hat on see come back when you can stay long and 30 seconds on sportscenter to the mariners look to navigate their way to the postseason blues back on the sidelines but the buckeyes remain a pain in the neck plus ernie s amazing comeback truck on over to sports center following the game and remember tomorrow on espn2 the final day of the regular season you will see one of those two games maybe both if they both mean something for the playoffs and if any of the eight playoff spots are still up for grabs after the auto race you will see all the meaningful action on espn back to ron well there you see our new score in colorado 35 at oklahoma 17 and you know right at the beginning of the second half mike adamle had the interview with the with koi pet bird that we thought that <person player="john hessler" race="UNK" position="QB">hessler</person> had calmed down but he was really into the game i think he s calm down all right in the second half alone he is 10 of 14 for 212 yards and three touchdowns looks pretty excited to me right now nation leslie stick two yards deep mr internet ron here s what happens when you get out strong on you all day you try to take it away stop it right there what happens is the corner rolls out though he s in an ease in a position to take away be out now what happens is til some boy sees the coverage now he breaks down the field stop it right here number five has got to be over the top that s mail and <person player="maylon wesley" race="UNK" position="DB">wesley</person> he s not there what do you have you got a touchdown for<person player="phil savoy" race="UNK" position="WR">phil savoy</person>busting coverage the sooners go from their own 32 scored since we had 42 left in the first half just throws it away have a speck jones he was holding on to it oklahoma s second half possessions not been pretty a jay kristoff defensive coordinator with some good halftime adjustments oklahoma missed some opportunities in the first half weve talked about that but again this is a team that s going to get back to the big games under howard schnellenberger he s going to take this time he s going to take a few look ins not many along the way and hell be back in these big games before long get out of bounds and again it s<person player="greg jones" race="UNK" position="DL">greg jones</person>who was out there to make the play number 59 id say barry switzer and spalled these the sooner fans here for so many years the great job he did here at oklahoma and of course butt hits boy yeah i think you call to what the oklahoma the seven dwarfs but they got the right guy to rebuild it flipping from the right over to the left on the bone and the 12 yard line that s clifton <person player="tyrell peters" race="UNK" position="LB">peters</person> who got that one looked like a bad snap again and the only thing i can figure out is there s so much going on around<person player="chuck langston" race="UNK" position="OL">chuck langston</person>with the blitzing and the linebacker on his nose that he s just not concentrating on getting the football back clifton <person player="tyrell peters" race="UNK" position="LB">peters</person> number 44 in the action side again i think what s happened is the bullying has really taken his toll on the shotgun here s the exchange and you see what he has to contend with the linebackers and everything the lo of blitz again the low snap rather clifton <person player="tyrell peters" race="UNK" position="LB">peters</person> with the recovery so were about to go under 7 minutes left to play in this one in colorado on the doorstep kessler with its marlin <person player="marlon barnes" race="UNK" position="RB">barnes</person> let s check in once again with mike tirico mike moments ago in san diego at the murph de buckler pitching to raul mondasey left with a knee injury last night dramatic 2run homer breaking a 1 all tied dodgers lead 31 if they win they clinch at worst a tie in the west not great news for the buck fans who were also rocky fans from ok thank you howard schnellenberger probably thinking about conversation she s going to have after the ballgame he s thinking about tomorrow he wants to get right back to that tape and he wants to get back on the crack and it s going to be a third down as <person player="marlon barnes" race="UNK" position="RB">barnes</person> takes it into the right side of the line this is still a pretty talented ball team oh no question theyve got a defense as good as this is and you got marquee people the linebackers<person player="cedric jones" race="UNK" position="DL">cedric jones</person>theyre just a lot of mistakes tonight not get the interception missed tackles block kicks and just things that did they unraveled a little bit and that s what you expect in a big game sometimes when a team hasnt been in one the way the 25 second clock is running down i would assume colorado is gonna call a timeout either that or just go ahead and wait and fall the timeout just before the clock went down and theyll stop the game clock it s five minutes of 51 seconds left to play so well take a break 35:17 colorado here s another clever idea from plymouth in the new plymouth grand voyage receipt it s not only a seat it s a table and a cup holder it can come with a drawer and once it can convert into two reclining child safety seats overall the plymouth grand voyager seats are the best minivan seats on wheels in fact they are the only minivan seats on wheels clever idea plymouth grand voyager it simply slides folds protects unfolds rules and drives better tom and sue younger began their voyage together nearly 40 years ago today in retirement as carefree is when they first set out that s because for the past 20some years they worked with a broken respect the power lines three a demon we measure success one investor at a time hi may i help you yeah i need some shorts to play basketball indoor or after one full quart or half i guess pick up our place shirts our skins excuse me day or night home or away team or oneonone is active were becoming too specialized for you try just to southwest heavyweight sweats and t s back to where that s right for however you play discus that led the way america plays horse or ping thirty five to seventeen colorado leading over oklahoma dont forget sportscenter coming up college football scores in highlights the major league baseball pennant race and the return of ernie irvan that and more on sportscenter which is cut up right after the ballgame so for colorado tonight they got a wakeup call in that first half as the sooners jumped out ten to nothing did 17 to 7 but here in the second hand particularly they have really come on as we mentioned passing game four or <person player="john hessler" race="UNK" position="QB">hessler</person> and the buffaloes has just been nothing shy of devastating you got an important game you bring he designated a couple games a year where you want with you behind the quarterback <person player="john hessler" race="UNK" position="QB">hessler</person> and you hear the whistle before he got the playoff and that s going to be another delay of game a real important game you might bring ralphy i dont think i dont think they travel ralphy that s the story of the game here at the big place for colorado such an explosive offense with all that speed outside mike adamle let s check in with you again well in point of fact they do travel ralphy but the big is is that the other team will allows him in kansas doesnt oklahoma doesnt that s why ralphy doesnt go on an old i wouldnt bring me i wouldnt come here gonna take it down to the ten yard line and it s going to be fourth down you really have to be a sportsman to let him come if youre the up hands team probably they worry most about the liability they stayed like this where it s closed you dont have a track there s not a area to to the house to the ralphie wed have take him around a couple of times for teaching his path paths as werth wants it to be attempt oscar ritchie and the ball will be placed down at the 18 so the 28 yard of chim dan he s got the chip shot knocks it all and it s up close now 38 to 17 mike adamle let s check with you again well ron for colorado fans wondering if the bucks can win a national championship without floyd entler the big 8 conference has precedence on its side let s go to 1984 remember suitors starter troy aikman before ii went to ucla he broke his leg jamel holloway comes on a wins own next seven games in this suitors half a national title in 1990 bill mccartney lost twothirds of darian hagan charles <person player="darrius johnson" race="UNK" position="DB">johnson</person> comes on and relief and of course everybody remembers last year nebraska fans friendly when tommy <person player="jeff frazier" race="UNK" position="RB">frazier</person> was sidelined by but blood clots brooke barringer s saved the dream season and went seven and oh so there is a little history for big eight backups the other thing about that mike is floyd edgar s probably going to return 34 tonight 348 yards and five touchdowns but as we mentioned to you probably the thing that s most impressive is what he has done in the second half he s got three touchdown passes here in the second half over 200 yards exactly jason leslie kicks it off dj and let s check in once again with mike tirico mike promised mcdonald s break away takes us to lincoln and those chief nebraska quarterbacks that mike was just talking about still happen to hang around in lincoln tommy <person player="jeff frazier" race="UNK" position="RB">frazier</person> today against washington state had two rushing touchdowns and ahman green the tailback had a big day as well over a hundred and fifty yards nebraska wins 147 they play at colorado four weeks from today that is going to be a great football game because colorado s down at home and then barring any unforeseen upsets and some pretty good teams in the big 8 thanks to our set russ oklahoma books it s nebraska also now theyd like <person player="stephen alexander" race="UNK" position="TE">alexander</person> a great deal the quarterbacks do and you can see why anything that s just in his own that but he reached up high and grabbed it in him took it out of bounds his kids only a sophomore he s out of chickasha oklahoma sportscenter coming up next and for just under five minutes left to play in our game didnt find anybody open and<person player="greg jones" race="UNK" position="DL">greg jones</person>is right there with him number 59 that s twice that he s been set ron murchison the linebacker was in coverage on steven <person player="stephen alexander" race="UNK" position="TE">alexander</person> and hadnt covered so well that s where derrick mckey tried to go with the football yoshi <person player="stephen alexander" race="UNK" position="TE">alexander</person> try to go back inside murchison collisions him here there s no place to go with the football then<person player="greg jones" race="UNK" position="DL">greg jones</person>wraps up garrett <person player="garrick mcgee" race="UNK" position="QB">mcgee</person> even complained and off the fingertips of <person player="kenny wilkins" race="UNK" position="DB">kenny</person> and then almost picked off so <person player="brian lewis" race="UNK" position="P">brian</person> ballistic punt of the way he waits back at the six yard line blasket back on a single safety for the buffaloes we fumbled the snap they had to return on the time goes down the sideline and well take it to the 40 and let s check in with mike tirico still keeping an eye on the baseball california ron they are in a very important mustwin situation jt snow threerun homer that extends california s lead the angels try to stay alive in the west race and the wildcard race im so confused im just gonna watch sportscenter in baseball tonight after us to get all straightened out youre confused up on us football people mike youre gonna have to explain that dust you dont know what s going on right right baseball class first peek myself i know you probably have figured out are you number 12 a sophomore out of oakland california 6 feet 205 and where you see the youngster do you think what im seeing number 12 on the floor i youve a blue robin plays the up blocking back in punt formation lot then we saw it last week with higgins but most teams dont use a quarterback in that position but what he can do it he did it against colorado state has take that short snap on a pump formation either throw or rumble go well the other thing is the reason you like a quarterback there some teams dish because he makes the town and he gives the block the assignor so it s a quarterback on the field making decisions garland <person player="marlon barnes" race="UNK" position="RB">barnes</person> with the terry boy dêtre calling to<person player="john hessler" race="UNK" position="QB">john hessler</person>for an autograph under three minutes left in this one sportscenter coming up immediately following our ball game looking at his watch and hard you write this been a long ballgame first half was really quick well run with the ball not gonna get away from<person player="cedric jones" race="UNK" position="DL">cedric jones</person>though is number 57 to put a forearm in this bank a lot of coaches probably tonight after a ball game go home will go home but i think howard s going to stick around here he s been known to pull some late nights after ballgames and go in get the tape right away and go to work right away probably cant sleep anyways sick to his stomach right now so he wants to look at the tape and figure out what he do what he has to do next and that s what you what coaching is all about teaching this young man here has got a clean ride back to boulder but trying to go down before they get him out of bounds and now tonight s abusive players of the game are from the university of colorado quarterback john and history 24:34 five touchdowns that s a school record and from oklahoma defensive end<person player="cedric jones" race="UNK" position="DL">cedric jones</person>six tackles setted hurries two sacks as part of their continuing effort to further the development of a bizarre athletics visa is proud to donate $1000 to each of these universities and $1,000 to the us olympic team on behalf of these athletes rania almost figured he was going to be better tonight because he got all the practice this woman he didnt have it against texas a&amp;m he had probably about 30% of the practice work in practice this week he got most eat all of it so this concentration was excellent tonight and the newer is going football they did a nice job of preparing john hester for this ball game they really did mike i think youve got a heck of a problem the bit more tries to go back well ill tell really i think they understand so well their situations and boy <person player="koy detmer" race="UNK" position="QB">detmer</person> last year same situation with kordell stewart he redshirted kordell stewart took it he knew he was going to be the quarterback i think boy det were still starting quarterback here now i agree with you they got a little bit of a problem there but say winning solves all that winning and theyre wide open offense as bill moreau the athletic director of colorado done in the sidelines to shake hands with his new head coach that play right there is going to wind the bottle bounds and that s not what they want to stop the clock bill standing on dudes which new hunches sportscenter coming up next immediately following her ball game 38 to 7 zealand the buffaloes and oklahoma has been able to score a point in the second half back the last time they scored was with just over five minutes to play in the first half the bootleg action and the third with the shovel pass <person player="marlon barnes"
