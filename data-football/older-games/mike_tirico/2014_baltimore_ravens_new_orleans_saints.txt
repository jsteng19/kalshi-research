baltimore doing a very good job this offense has improved a lot timeout sakes he s in here from new orleans theyve burned two timeouts in the first six minutes well the saints are a mess mike in their secondary just like the ravens are this is a defense under rob ryan that utilized three safeties at a time last year the problem is roman harper s gone they lost malcolm <person player="john jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="DT">jenkins</person> as well with the philadelphia eagles the man they brought in <person player="jairus byrd" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jairus byrd</person> is hurt when

race="nonwhite" position="DB">sanford</person> the saints are in trouble against the spread formations and baltimore knows it there s your point john harper <person player="john jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="DT">jenkins</person> the veterans leave in the off season leaves a lot of money to sign bird from buffalo he inches his knee his replacement was <person player="rafael bush" race="nonwhite" position="DB">rafael bush</person> he got hurt injuring his leg here last week against cincinnati and if any sincere he was a backup as special teamer was also lost to the fractured arm so major attrition that position the 13/4 set tried to cut it back kicks hit him and then the rest of the posse gets there to bring him down <person player="marcus ball" race="UNK" position="LB">marcus ball</person> one of those safeties with the tackle tonto to the safety issues straightened the saints the front seven wood makes it monthly and <person player="cameron jordan" race="UNK" position="DE">jordan</person> followed by the linebacking core who really like hurt his losses on the inside <person player="junior galette" race="UNK" position="DE">junior galette</person> a big sack season last year kenny vaqueros the one experience safety robinson s bench earlier in the season returns to a starting role thatll be real careful with <person player="brian dixon" race="UNK" position="DB">brian dixon</person> a rookie at the top of the screen against <person player="steve smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">steve smith</person> mike way clock runs down is <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> that s the burnet im up i havent played half a quarter past the timeouts to the half or gone three of the six of the youth but gives us something john talked about <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> and this offensive change what is it bit about the kubiak system that fits <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> well it s a west coast system and one of the things i like is it s putting <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">joe flacco</person> under the center and youre seeing more and more timing patterns keep an eye on his footwork tonight five steps one hitch five steps falls out with no hitch he s accurate he s getting better and better he can throw the quick game and obviously with this song stretch running there are some wicked bootlegs and play actions that have clearly hurt moorlands already that s the running game that kubiak was so successful with in denver is the offensive coordinator for mike shanahan and then his eight years in houston has had cook up top smith versus <person player="brian dixon" race="UNK" position="DB">dixon</person> there tonight the saint spring pressure it s going to <person player="steve smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">steve smith</person> nixon pumps into a smith bought it and bounds for the touchdown what a play by <person player="steve smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">steve smith</person> and <person player="joe flacco" race="white" position="QB">joe flacco</person> knew it there s no way <person player="brian dixon" race="UNK" position="DB">dixon</person> can handle the veteran <person player="steve smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">steve smith</person> in oneonone coverage it s an outside release fly pattern and the rookie from northwest missouri has no chance against the 14 veteran <person player="steve smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">steve smith</person> of course the scoring place will automatically reviewed backside comes down as he is just completing the act of the catch there stays secured all the way to the ground and through the end of the play about <person player="steve smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">steve smith</person> last night mike he said im not fond of his saint it s a professional dislike no i just hate the saints and once again he proves his dislike for the new orleans saints what a catch by the battery see if this requires further inspection er it s good it is confirmed as a touchdown so <person player="steve smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">steve smith</person> strikes again against new orleans saints had fourth and goal at the ravens one they got stopped baltimore nutkum for a loss of two and the extra point by <person player="justin tucker" race="white" position="K">justin tucker</person> caps a nine play 97 yards opening drive capped off by an old nemesis <person player="steve smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">steve smith</person> senior 700 door which are you talked about the passion with which <person player="steve smith" race="nonwhite"

monday nights theyll dig out of an early hole here tonight well the saints take over for the second time at the 20 they got down to the 1 what happened opening drive first and goal he opponents one

position="WR">kenny stills</person> the secondyear receiver his 30second catch remember this new orleans team operating without brandon <person player="brandin cooks" race="nonwhite"

in and played well see <person player="jacoby jones" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jacoby jones</person> outstanding kick returner if that pass would have been a first down maybe was worth a challenge

race="white" position="QB">flacco</person> is very involved in this raise and run system what to dissect the saint s defense second and 11 that bullet for <person player="torrey smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">torrey smith</person> lingo be third down these are the situations where the saints must muster a pass rush <person player="cameron jordan" race="UNK" position="DE">cameron

the ravens 73yard cut one shy of his alltime record states could have had a touchdown on a pick six rob ryan s team apparently unhappy they see a very interesting style of punch by cook john watch this he dropped it with a nose down and it allowed him to get that knuckling effect he saw the young returner <person player="jalen saunders" race="UNK" position="WR">saunders</person> back there and he said deal with this so the saints take over third tribe from their own 15yard line back to skills on the run to be the seventh up team on the mills and jets here s chris berman in the studio all

replay the <person player="marcus ball" race="UNK" position="LB">ball</person> is coming out before he s down by contact yeah you need to see a clear recovery and replay to give it to new orleans and

sevenpoint lead don is 15 he s made an impact on the 2014 ravens <person player="justin forsett" race="nonwhite" position="RB">justin forsett</person> puts them up cetera gary kubiak offense is averaging ten and a half yards per play here the first quarter and a half he always seems to find running backs to the <person player="terrell suggs" race="nonwhite" position="DE">terrell</person> <person player="todd davis" race="nonwhite" position="LB">davis</person> remember sixth round pick of the success he had in denver kubiak the offensive coordinator there with guys like the landis gary and mike anderson were coming through relatively unknown unheard of clinton portis was a known factor and he continued that success but a rueben droughns adding to that list and then he goes to houston is the head coach that steve slayton picks up the slack and undrafted arian <person player="glenn foster" race="UNK" position="DE">foster</person> becomes a multiple time pro bowler and now <person player="justin forsett" race="nonwhite" position="RB">justin forsett</person> now at 800 even this year with a bloodied little battered but enjoying the best times of his sevenyear nfl career is led in that touchdown that is baltimore 7 point leads but backs getting the glory but the system really works for these runners certainly does and you got a credit rick dennison who came with them from houston they know what theyre doing touch back saints will take over at the 20 the saints weve seen plenty good backs here over the years all speaking of backs they miss the threat of a reggie <person player="rafael bush" race="nonwhite" position="DB">bush</person> i saw him on a halfback choice and beat patrick willis no problem then they got their heard sprawls and he ran it better than reggie <person player="rafael bush" race="nonwhite" position="DB">bush</person> i saw him beat a jayhawk and i couldnt believe yardage in these back spain but sproles is gone now he s running halfback choice for the philadelphia eagles with similar results in the same dont even run have that choice anymore so they miss that tonnage if they had coming out in the backfield in the passing game like here in thomas s trying to take that role he takes a handoff here and gains four yards thomas had missed the last four games with his injuries and they were missing some of what he brings put john that s been such a difference making part of this offense that is part of the reason some of the starch is not here candidly with sean payton s unit right now as good an offensive coach as ive met and he knows how to use all five eligible receivers and the running backs are good for over 125 catches a year in this system and big plays and they dont really have that element without darren sproles and reggie <person player="rafael bush" race="nonwhite" position="DB">bush</person> obviously second and six cats out of the backfield for <person player="mark ingram" race="UNK" position="RB">mark ingram</person> doesnt catch it as much as thomas does his 19th reception of the year and a first down was <person player="rafael bush" race="nonwhite" position="DB">bush</person> s now with the lions sproles left last year and is off in philadelphia was receiving totals jump we had 70 plus reception seasons five times <person player="rafael bush" race="nonwhite" position="DB">bush</person> had an 80 plus reception season when he arrived and that unique use of these guys by sean payton helped make them a lot of money and the saints very successful and they were great returners and the saints that struggled doing that without them as well 37 they get it in the hands of <person player="kenny stills" race="nonwhite" position="WR">kenny stills</person> that time baltimore waiting on the other side the loss of two and another big play by the rookie <person player="cj mosley" race="UNK" position="LB">cj mosley</person> you can get me once but youre gonna have a hard time getting me twice theyre gonna run a reverse back to the offensive right <person player="cj mosley" race="UNK" position="LB">cj mosley</person> falls back easily and he beat <person player="zach strief" race="white" position="OT">zach strief</person> for the tackle in think the athletic every down future stock marie s got a little pica with the ravens were doing decides to check it down thomas as <person player="drew brees" race="white" position="QB">brees</person> got his thomas takes it right around the 40 yard long <person player="drew brees" race="white" position="QB">drew brees</person> uses <person player="jimmy graham" race="white" position="TE">jimmy graham</person> to gather presnap information when you see the coroner s go over to cover the receivers he knows it s man when he sees the coroner line up over here against the tight end breeze those at some form of a zone or a zone blitz that time it s a zone blitz but <person player="drew brees" race="white" position="QB">brees</person> uses these formations to see the defense now you know it s mantoman because well hill is out here on grand nopales of the net short motion <person player="drew brees" race="white" position="QB">brees</person> third down and complete as again reese s pressure for the flag comes down backed by the quarterback hello team nassau came in there and did he go up to hot personal foul roughing the passer number 90 judy 15 y/o generally automatic push down there you look at it not sock comes right up the middle proud of the helmet to the chin and well take the <person player="marcus ball" race="UNK" position="LB">ball</person> across midfield hits a ravens territory some questionable calls against the ravens tonight one against <person player="will hill" race="nonwhite" position="DB">will hill</person> on third one and that one against lod not top alert for the shot play in this field position had the bullet out the skills national beam on the sideline to a first down gain of seven weve covered a st so many times mike and when sean payton gets the <person player="marcus ball" race="UNK" position="LB">ball</person> between the forties you must be alert for the shot place he carries 8 to 10 shot plays in every game plan and he tries not to go home without using all of his bullets and his second is short in this position id be surprised he doesnt take one here thirtyeight breeze looking has to check it down to thomas help until tackle by <person player="courtney upshaw" race="nonwhite" position="LB">courtney</person> upjohn talking about these alabama linebackers they took up sean the second round in 2012 he and <person player="cj mosley" race="UNK" position="LB">mosley</person> you know pretty good pair to roll tide with roll up shaw s a professional edge center in the running game and underneath in past coverage and he comes off the field he must be a very unselfish football player mike because he doesnt get the opportunities to rush he allows do merville that come in fresh as a daisy and do what he does best the communicating breeze snaps it while theyre talking about it <person player="kenny stills" race="nonwhite" position="WR">stills</person> downfield that <person player="kenny stills" race="nonwhite" position="WR">stills</person> close to the weapon was he in bounds when he pulled it away

position="LB">ball</person> away from <person player="danny gorrer" race="UNK" position="DB">danny</person> gore who thinks he has an interception that looks like duke feet possession to me oh wow you

he s talking to his guys upstairs he s throwing the challenge flag see the <person player="marcus ball" race="UNK" position="LB">ball</person> slips out of his hands and back between his knees and he finally secures it and harbaugh is challenging this call baltimore s challenging the ruling on the field of a completed pass by the saints once he gains complete control of the <person player="marcus ball" race="UNK" position="LB">ball</person> as they fight for it is he in bounds or not got another replay review of oh youre excited about thank goodness resin replay it was a battle with a <person

quad injury but it s a good thing there s only two games tonight mike because dean blandino has been busy in new york it s a the art mcnally deemed a central im candidly surprised at that did anybody

tom benson donation to the hall of fame the owner of the saints sent a letter to all of his fellow owners saying im donating a million dollars towards this legends program to help those who run into hard times and eating courage his fellow owners to do the same thing and they it s a great opportunity for all the owners to help pay back the greats who helped make the game if they do fall on hard times and a lot of credit to a man who kept the saints viable in new orleans and the pelicans the nba team viable here after the tough economic times post katrina well said mike he s been awfully good to a lot of people for a long time and right now he needs his saint defense to get off the field on third down and give <person player="drew brees" race="white" position="QB">drew brees</person> a chance in the twominute drill interesting final timeout taken there by new orleans saints have got to prove they can cover some people mike rob ryan needs the blitz to get the pressure he needs and when that happens somebody in the secondary has got to rise to the occasion the saints are out of timeouts in the unlikely event there s a play that they would like to challenge in the next 23 seconds they cant third and five black oh hey spun sacks thrown down by <person player="junior galette" race="UNK" position="DE">junior galette</person> that s the man they need <person player="junior galette" race="UNK" position="DE">galette</person> big contract in the offseason he s made millions he s from stillman college and that time on his study he finishes <person player="joe flacco"

best records at 7 and 4 along with the chargers and browns and the tiebreakers will start to factor in but you see why this is important for the ravens stay with that 7 &amp; 4 group stay within a half game of their division lead or fall back with the dolphins and bill s at 6 &amp; 5 knuckling one driver by <person player="sam koch" race="white" position="P">sam</person> hook it on the bounce

saints returns to just shy of the 20 yard line no timeouts minute 51 left for <person player="drew brees" race="white" position="QB">drew brees</person> and new orleans this is what <person player="drew brees" race="white" position="QB">brees</person> does very well obviously mike and you gotta remember beer thomas has been out for the last few weeks they love to run screen passes check downs and <person player="pierre thomas" race="nonwhite" position="RB">pierre thomas</person> as good as any back there is in football picking up blitzes but watch out for number 23 early in this series brings complete were getting them six to thomas to the 25yard line new orleans use two of their three timeouts in the first quarter ravens are going to be real careful with this young secondary i dont expect to see any blitzes straight fourman rush where s downs breeze out of the backfield with thomas to the 40yard line what they do they just kill you with <person player="pierre thomas" race="nonwhite" position="RB">pierre thomas</person> in these two minutes situations sideline they complete trying to get it to nicktoons be peace he just called an exotic blitz three men coming from outside the tackle there s a lot of clubs in this raven defense s bag and he s has been around long enough he s not afraid to use any of them <person player="elvis dumervil" race="nonwhite" position="LB">elvis</person> do merville got hit by <person player="terrell suggs" race="nonwhite" position="DE">terrell suggs</person> in that last play they ran into each other right by the

excellent job plastering his man in coverage the quarterback starts rambling buying time it gives his receivers time to get open and it s difficult on these defensive backs nice job by weather third in the short and <person player="drew brees" race="white" position="QB">brees</person> throws complete its <person player="travaris cadet" race="UNK" position="RB">cadet</person> for the first time again no time outs saints are one of the great situational preparation scenes you little sean payton practice and they work on these exact situations no time outs 80 yards and <person player="drew brees" race="white" position="QB">brees</person> is great at managing the clock along with sean shot in the middle it s caught by <person player="marques colston" race="nonwhite" position="WR">colston</person> driven down to 27 and a killer see the screens and check downs and breezes notorious for all three of those in the twominute drill go back to a small play here john 2:23 i think was the exact time on the clock of sean payton uses final timeout on that side of the twominute warning the defense comes up with the pressure gets the sack it buys <person player="drew brees" race="white" position="QB">brees</person> another possession the ravens get the <person player="marcus ball" race="UNK" position="LB">ball</person> to start the third quarter so really can help get you closer here knowing baltimore s coming back out your defense is on the ropes a little bit the small clock management thing it was a little bit of a risk to take but my payoff in points may be the lead for new orleans from the 26 <person player="drew brees" race="white" position="QB">brees</person> pumping taking his shot to the end zone to kolstad touchdown unbelievable riki free safety sneaks into game <person player="terrence brooks" race="nonwhite" position="DB">terrence brooks</person> breeze looks along these shreds brookes dirty body had the interception and the veteran alltime
