to play the first ballgame because theyre excited about plan they want to play how long can the emotional laugh i think the key for nebraska is plays over 15 yards big plays oklahoma state has to stop the big place and they would love to stop him here on third the long two and make the basket go three and out the single setback so dangerous anyone miss starting quarterback job in spring practice tom osborne said they were even in the fall but tommy frazier won the job in spring practice ive ive turned the spring mike and i tail he throws the ball with more confidence now he s a better passer this year than he was last year barring year will wait his tender he will play tonight and certainly through the first four or five games hed get a lot a minute it s the pullback makovicka the senior from brainerd nebraska straight up the middle with their missing tory schlessinger from the year ago who was so effective on that one mike oklahoma state is starting to true freshman and linebacker

two freshmen linebackers a lot of different looks tonight a lot of different options i can think of a lot of teams this would be the last team id want to start to freshmen linebackers against because of so many different things they do on offense you see tommy frazier on a couple of different options here in the game and the injured player back to roy johnson number four bérenger rw mcquarters in the 17th comes in to replace johnson he is the prize of the freshman recruiting plan pillow that s what they needed a brave girl they need a break and they need to get on the board they need to make

away oklahoma state s offense <person player="tony veland" race="UNK" position="DB">tony</person> <person player="cedric jones" race="UNK" position="DL">jones</person> will come out for the cowboys at quarterback andre richardson his biggest weapon the big 8 stop freshman last year with jeff grenier kent walked the club s most experienced receivers played in just four games joined by terrence richardson and mays an allconference candidate brian hope centers a veteran line he line in and waterbury have a combined 54 starts thompson is the deep back nebraska defense<person player="christian peter" race="UNK" position="DL">christian peter</person>the only returning starter out front joined by brother <person player="jason peter" race="UNK" position="DL">jason</person> both thomas and <person player="grant wistrom" race="UNK" position="DL">wistrom</person> saw significant minutes last year in the middle senior<person player="phil ellis" race="UNK" position="LB">phil ellis</person>a butkus award candidate with <person player="jay foreman" race="nonwhite" position="LB">foreman</person> intro williger alongside and <person player="tony veland" race="UNK" position="DB">tony</person> wilander over last year moves over to free safety stubbs williams and <person player="mike minter" race="UNK" position="DB">minter</person> round out a veteran secondary play early in the game here my third in 1552 defense sudden change got to be ready to go on the field get the ball back from the outside for the big it looks like they tried to double him mike<person player="jared tomich" race="UNK" position="DL">jared tomich</person>number 93 the 62 250pound junior youre going to see jeremy off at number 70 trying to go out with the tight in and he just beat him around the corner but <person player="tony veland" race="UNK" position="DB">tony</person> <person player="cedric jones" race="UNK" position="DL">jones</person> didnt help the play because he continued outside they are so quick on the outside and those defensive end slash linebackers come so hard lawson bought the kicker hawley number 43 a junior college player he s a block kick <person player="chris blocker" race="UNK" position="WR">blocker</person> let s see if he can get in there in his first time<person player="tyrone williams" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tyrone williams</person>is the deep man 39yard punt on the month they advanced it three yards timeout on the field no score possession starts at the 28 yard line and their defensive stand by after the turnover was huge philip <person player="travian smith" race="UNK" position="DL">smith</person> direction según there he comes up on a hurry but philip skill man 37yard mike so far nebraska s opened this ball game and trying to power trying to affect those freshman linebackers with misdirection but we remember the biggest weapon they have is the playaction pass with tommy frazier the secondary you mentioned theyre coming up fast when you come up fast against nebraska youre gonna leave somebody open on that post pattern and there s always been something about the nebraska play calling they find a way to get it to pull back or throw that ball at exactly the right time 39 kevin williams the strong side safety made the tackle im talking to one of the freshmen linebackers the other day <person player="billy legate" race="UNK" position="RB">billy</person> stone had practice his eyes were biggest saucers he said i know theyre gonna challenge us right up inside the action makes us think punch doctor what do you have on the oklahoma state sun were already beginning a piece of to platooning in the linebacker corps by lammeter coach <person player="brent dequasie" race="UNK" position="LB">brent</person> guy i remember he started to true freshman inside <person player="billy legate" race="UNK" position="RB">billy</person> stuff mike all right gerry they could use some because frazier already has 37 rushing on four steps on trent fisher and it was half a step overthrown well mike in 1994 when they won the national championship one out of every eight completions was for a touchdown now this should have been a touchdown to <person player="reggie baul" race="UNK" position="WR">reggie</person> ball number seven and the ball is thrown in pretty good shape it just looks like <person player="reggie baul" race="UNK" position="WR">reggie</person> ball just lost his footing trent fisher number 15s beaten but the ball was throwing very well by<person player="tommie frazier" race="UNK" position="QB">tommie frazier</person>mike youre absolutely right it looked like he lost the step when he stumbled and goes down the other 46 yard line norman williams who s quite a story is a nose man at 240 pounds going against that huge nebraska line and he hung in there pretty well he s five foot ten he s short for a nose guard but theyd like to move him and coaches says dont be fooled by his side he s very elusive but he s a wrestler and wrestlers understand leverage just inside the 40yard line caught him in a blitz <person player="brian lewis" race="UNK" position="P">lewis</person> adams the outside backer another is on a stunt <person player="mark gilman" race="UNK" position="TE">mark</person> gillman wideopen against man coverage and tommy frazier s have put it right on the numbers good play call because the brass has got good protection against this stunt you see <person player="mark gilman" race="UNK" position="TE">mark</person> gillman working across the field good protection good completion by tommy frazier youll mike the nebraska looks a little rusty at the start of the game but you have to remember in college football there s no there s no inner squad games or there s no like basketball place greece and yugoslavia there s no team like that so this is your first true test under the lights makovicka and metro the brass delino tonight lorenzo <person player="ahman green" race="nonwhite" position="RB">green</person> number 98 is 6270 coach ted gill the defensive coordinator said he s the most physical player we have you have to do a lot of thinking when youre on defense against the option because you have to play assignment football lorenzo <person player="ahman green" race="nonwhite" position="RB">green</person> had the quarterback<person player="tommie frazier" race="UNK" position="QB">tommie frazier</person>made the best of it it only has 18 career catch what s happening to oklahoma state and their linebackers its direction again because theyre so conscious of the run watch tommy frazier now he fakes one way he moves the other way now the tight end comes behind the linebackers <person player="mark gilman" race="UNK" position="TE">mark</person> gillman the linebacker sitting in there watch linebacker see theyre having to sit in there a little bit for the fake and that s opening the tight end over the middle you could almost hear the freshman <person player="josh cobb" race="UNK" position="RB">josh</person> greene say freshman <person player="josh cobb" race="UNK" position="RB">josh</person> <person player="ahman green" race="nonwhite" position="RB">green</person> in on the tackle again might leave very punch and i handle nice talk with the three freshmen linebackers and caper leblanc put his best he said this is a lifelong dream but it happened a little longer but he said im ready to go anything what dont do this settle down a little bit as this game goes along number 19 defenses you have it designed to option as we know option the ball can either be kept by the quarterback of piste this is a design for tommy frazier theyre blocking the man who s responsible for the quarterback good block by fish <person player="chris dishman" race="UNK" position="OL">dishman</person> number 75 nebraska s seventh first down in the first quarter the numbers on pleasure it s inside the five about the three and the initial guys you have four or five guys on the team that go by initials like rw or bj or a couple of <person player="billy legate" race="UNK" position="RB">billy</person> joe s you got a pretty good football team well i know rw mcquarters a pretty good football player the first drill they had when they had the freshman week the perimeter where you throw a lot of passes he intercepted cool the isolation mike last

school game to the national championship team philips police are returning about shirking the country chris brown on to the home in the nebraska arsenal theyre kicking game because they have kids with no experience what with the first punch down the first touchdown of his junior season 20 girls running the club with thompson and his back dont stray back to 12 thompson bar potential about the 23 yard line in the big gate in russia 19 yard mic against nebraska last year he had six attempts for swell rushing yards tough team to run against andre richards at the helm deal that gets six attempts for eight yards so they give up the russian yards he graduated and nebraska steals the ball thomas comes out with it <person player="tony veland" race="UNK" position="DB">tony</person> <person player="cedric jones" race="UNK" position="DL">jones</person> is gonna have to make some plays at the quarterback position he has scrambling ability he s a veteran quarterback he provides great leadership but he s going to have to make some plays with his ability in this ball game he s got to scramble for some yardage when pressure comes on him but it s gonna have to hit some passes the last thing you want to do and move up front and it was the right guard <person player="josh cobb" race="UNK" position="RB">josh</person> hinson the junior who moved early the wide receiver he is another freshman on third and 11 but weve got a timeout on the field 6nothing nebraska over oklahoma federal building back in april keep an eye on number 17 for oklahoma state rw mcquarters he flies to the near side he s the defensive back they put him in on offense they want to get him the football which screen is set up he got on the corner again come on the field theyre going to get the ball to him doesnt send a real good signal to your other receivers here s a good quick seed flip screen rw mcquarters had opened up in the middle and a good first down my oklahoma state good car by les miles the offensive coordinator oklahoma state s first first out of the game and before that play they had had oh in total he went first look like<person player="jason peter" race="UNK" position="DL">jason

checks in second and 14<person player="phil ellis" race="UNK" position="LB">phil ellis</person>number 41 in on the packet when you prepare for a claim like this if youre nebraska against oklahoma state right you have to go back and look at michigan film because that s where the coordinator came from you get a look at colorado fellas bob simmons came from there and you look at a bunch of tape you look at you practice against about everything you think youre going to see and then once the game starts that call but at a when you have young ballclub drop this line is not handling the defensive line dont want to put it up and get the interception up or get your quarterback killed give it to the fallback punt the ball on this play defense go line<person player="tyrone williams" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tyrone williams</person>is waiting in his own 45 excuse me greg ivey the putter and williams waits at his 45 iv last year a unanimous allbig 8 choice average 44 yards a kick that was ninth in the country and they used an open formation mic so that their two head hunters the two wide receivers that are split here get a chance to get down on the punt returner before he can catch the football charlie 43 is on the near side pick walker supremes not coming this time that s a good but returnable 49yard punt a return of 13 espn is your home for tea with 151 to go first horta mike patrick mike gottfried and dr jerry punch with you<person player="damon benning" race="UNK" position="RB">damon benning</person>number 21 they didnt fail back and then he picks up about seven yards malibu bailey makes the tackle he was running behind <person player="adam treu" race="UNK" position="OL">adam</person> true big number 77 it was so well blocked he had a hard time finding anybody to hit but you get hot and get to hide behind those big offensive lime in there six for 306 49 53 ten and they just kind of hide<person player="damon benning" race="UNK" position="RB">damon benning</person>there s 511 but still five pounds inside the 30 world after 27 yardline guys a program really on the rise in central florida one double 18 that wants to go to one eighth if that great individual panel like marquette <person player="travian smith" race="UNK" position="DL">smith</person> the transfer from florida state and he is tearing up eastern kentucky a 60 yard run a freshman quarterback named on st paul pepper was 12 for his first 12 golden knights had the lead mike a lot of people think don thinks that dante culpepper might have been the best player coming on a state of florida last year a lot of people thought he s going to go to florida ended up with central florida call the state needs another powerhouse football team in the northern audience the nose man nebraska is owning first down now that s one of the few times that oklahoma state has been able to put them in second and long good play by norman williams the middle guard boy defeating that library s rare right now he s fighting for air and low as he can with his big linemen and he s up against<person player="aaron graham" race="UNK" position="OL">aaron graham</person>who 64 275 nebraska thinks the best thunders of ever have of course he may be the best center anybody ever had razor on the option cuts it inside people waiting for like jamal williams number 99 at a high school and that s the end of the first quarter at least a moral victory for of law mistake there only is the ball at the cowboy 23 the third and six bending the deep man he gets the ball first down and more with kevin williams on his back a gain of 13 now 36 was no problem wasnt no and ill tell you what they did she just lined up and ran the isolation at the linebacker just keep your eye on the fullback he s going to stick the linebacker here gonna get a doubleteam on norman williams number 90 there s the doubleteam now there s the block by bryan <person player="brian schuster" race="UNK" position="RB">schuster</person> number 20 81 told one well if youre keeping score at home by the number of true freshman starting on defense oklahoma state you can have another one <person player="jermaine fazande" race="UNK" position="RB">jermaine</person> berto where s ron oklahoma in for the injured junior javon lankford that length were just taking into xray a moment ago and i have been told but after kari couch at langford has fractured a bone in the pan the second metacarpal and theyre showing the tyler will hell be able to be taped to get back in but i doubt well see the do you back in so now three true freshman playing at linebacker for osu right jerry it s gotta be tough to come back in with a broken bone in your hand because when dr judith hands so much frazier silly stone just made something happen because if he didnt deflect this football it was a touchdown because<person player="mark gilman" race="UNK" position="TE">mark gilman</person>the standing wide open in the end zone you see<person player="tommie frazier" race="UNK" position="QB">tommie frazier</person>here s the throw <person player="billy legate" race="UNK" position="RB">billy</person> stone leaps up but you see

somebody we dont cut myself another good play by <person player="billy legate" race="UNK" position="RB">billy</person> stolen when he can stretch the option out that s what you want to do force tommy frees her to keep the ball and run sideline to sideline do not get turned up field that s what they be at that time his great statement by nebraska heck with the field goal we got fourth and six we would try to get a touchdown now they bring on the field goal kicker first round trying to give him a little confidence and put three more on the boys remember he s missed an extra point but he doesnt miss this one brown is true on a and nebraska extends its presentation um thursday 9 thursday and i had open a chris brown to kick it away rw mcquarters the deep man waiting at the goal line and forced back in the end zone again kicked off by chris brown and theyll have to take over at the 20 yard line time for <person player="tony veland" race="UNK" position="DB">tony</person> <person player="cedric jones" race="UNK" position="DL">jones</person> to get something started for this club what if you were calling the offensive plays what would you try to do right now now you got you got to do the unpredictable against when youre out manned and oklahoma state s out man youve got to run when they think youre going to pass richardson is the beat me <person player="cedric jones" race="UNK" position="DL">jones</person> for the crocodile let s go to joe hunt on national television but we ask them was that question said one answer exposure if we win the game in our parliament even get blown out kids watching at home buffoon say hey i can go there and i could be an impact player i want to go be apart or the resulting putts go either way irrespective of the numbers of the scoreboard bob simmons comes on a way that winner in the long range plans for a program i couldnt agree with you more bring some gifts that the bob simmons is going to have a successful program here not with his background weight had a good recruiting year last year in jerry punch talking about the thursday night exposure every team s coaches and players they like to watch this thursday night d now this is the first week of the season there s only everybody s undefeated except two teams whove lost those two early games so everybody s excited and really ready to go so this thursday night game is a great exposure for oklahoma state formation on 2nd and 8th again what is the only receiver with any experience he s only played in four career games and he just made his first two catches and it looked like theyre working on number 16 erik <person player="eric stokes" race="UNK" position="DB">stokes</person> he s off on the sidelines now theyre pulling him up just a second he was given a little bit too big a cushion and they didnt yet luck number 20<person player="michael booker" race="UNK" position="DB">michael booker</person>is in there right now for <person player="eric stokes" race="UNK" position="DB">stokes</person> 16 yeah theyll give him a chance to come off the sidelines watch a couple plays see what s going on getting back in the ball game <person player="cedric jones" race="UNK" position="DL">jones</person> is down hit three out of four for 28 yards and 33 theyd love to keep the drive going moving early by a lot of people now for the cowboys bag of the 33 when you get that penalty and you go up to 33 where you can run and pass you got some options 2/3 you want to throw the ball and you have to throw it the penalty set this interception up for<person player="terrell farley" race="UNK" position="LB">terrell farley</person>the king of college player number 43 and the coaches were telling me the other day if the meetings we have at the brashness that he could be the real deal he can do a lot of things we just find for tom osburn run one in the end zone supposedly the number one junior college refer to the year played at independence community college and gets his first touchdown brown for the point after after the interception return of twenty nine yards and you can feel the air blowing out of the bowl sixteen nothing nebraska so the kick <person player="chris blocker" race="UNK" position="WR">blocker</person> barukh so ops comes up with a big play on the vine it looks like nebraska s second first team quarterback would get a chance to play the next time the huskers get the football and they brought some fans with him about 25hundred showed up nebraska looks just about as tough as everybody thought they were then another pony liftoff chris brown has done a great job let s go back to the intercepts might remember the penalty now look here all the three of the linemen are covered and theyre going to run a stunt and theyre gonna free up and get the pressure on <person player="tony veland" race="UNK" position="DB">tony</person> <person player="cedric jones" race="UNK" position="DL">jones</person> then watch number 43<person player="terrell farley" race="UNK" position="LB">terrell farley</person>make the interception but because of the penalty they were allowed to pressure them here defensively ball thrown right to number 43<person player="terrell farley" race="UNK" position="LB">terrell farley</person>touchdown nebraska no pace no arc no nothing on that throw and it turns into a 29 yard interception return for a touchdown i can tell by williger number 91 met him in the hall and took him back the other one mike he s 65 225 and i was reading one of his comments the other day said when he played the orange bowl last year and he said they got the call to go in the game so i was so refreshing that everything was the same as we practiced i thought a straight line because that s what you want to do as a coach the staff want to put him in he s sweet she s all week so when they didnt guys got a 37 in a half inch vertical jump not carolina senate incomplete and and <person player="tony veland" race="UNK" position="DB">tony</person> <person player="cedric jones" race="UNK" position="DL">jones</person> appears to have a very slow throwing motion and that s why people have been able to see what he s done to to delivering the football you see when he throws the football throws it low and gibbs lineman a chance from their hands up to deflect the football mike you said for the open that the motion is on the side of oklahoma state depth and conditioning look like it s on the side of nebraska and that s a big factor because it s brutally hot down there it was 94 game time holding midfield got a block wrong situation they run a sprint drone and pop it up the middle karen it had to be a beautiful thing in the eyes of bob zimmer philip kind of market into the tailback aware were cooking end of the week back richardson get to talk theyre on the outside with koala girl sort of a doubleclutch on the pitch almost looked like the fullback in the tailback left at the same time and really didnt provide an avenue to get the ball in for <person player="tony veland" race="UNK" position="DB">tony</person> <person player="cedric jones" race="UNK" position="DL">jones</person> good pursuit by nebraska <person player="jared tomich" race="UNK" position="DL">jared</person> thomas wisdom is the single wide receiver far away there is a penalty and theyre boring and rough the option plays a neutralizing claim down here because goal line defense is like the stinking sound ran the option got the bitch out the andre richardson good block by jeff winnie a number six theyre gonna pass on the twopoint play here to try to get within eight and try to kick the extra point large it was the longest one in north football and set up the two yards one that leaves our score at 16 7 unto kicked off the <person player="reggie baul" race="UNK" position="WR">reggie</person> ball and<person player="damon benning" race="UNK" position="RB">damon benning</person>my good teams answer the scores of other teams that s what you strive to do when i hear four four to the back of the end zone so nebraska will start at the 20 and the 95 season mike how is he different how do you defense him different i dont think theyll do anything different offensively with <person player="brook berringer" race="UNK" position="QB">brook</person> berenger he s supposed to be the better thrower of the two although i like tommy frazier s improvement the throwing area ted gill the defensive coordinator says sometimes you start to concentrate on the quarterback switch the foot banter and avoid nebraska didnt wait long pretty loud answer to you know this place stop when youre dead kill the defensive coordinator stop and you look at it right there the play is stopped there s just a missed tackle by number 98 lorenzo <person player="ahman green" race="nonwhite" position="RB">green</person> and then once <person player="lawrence phillips" race="UNK" position="RB">lawrence</person> <person player="eric stokes" race="UNK" position="DB">stokes</person> was in the secondary he s off and running frank solich a running back coach compares him to <person player="michael rose" race="UNK" position="RB">rose</person> here he said he s strong back with good speed theyre gone for two nebraska is going to try to go for two here theyre up 22 7 full house backfield too tight in <person player="mark gilman" race="UNK" position="TE">gilman</person> <person player="mark gilman" race="UNK" position="TE">gilman</person> had a step on the defender you have to remember mike you sitting on the sidelines now he wasnt throwing he didnt work on throwing before he came in so he s got to be a little bit cold my ranking after losing 14 started you can see they dont miss many of those guys right now i think your story of the offensive linemen im gonna let you tell the two didnt play last year was an allamerican i got a starter as a preseason allamerican 27 yard line he is going to be something for the next four years at oklahoma state<person player="terrell farley" race="UNK" position="LB">terrell farley</person>made the tackle in special teams here s the kickoff youre gonna see the wedge warm now what do you want to do is your hunting bag just let them take them on behind the scene then try to break against the grain but nebraska s too much speed<person player="terrell farley" race="UNK" position="LB">terrell farley</person>the player who made the interception made the tackle so theyll start from the 27 yard line galatians got a good program a lot of games on thursday night in fact and well keep you updated on everything at 10:30 or 15 minutes after the hour that getting six and oklahoma state for that 78 yard run before that they had three delay whoops i was too hard incomplete tried to get a garage of pfeiffer s the backup tight in pfeiffer may have been looking downfield roger pfeiffer was just running an option play he s going to go down and just curl in or furrow out against the linebacker here s the route he just works downfield nice sees him on his outside shorter turns inside the dean get his head around quick enough to find the football third and six with 850 q to go for example one of the inside linebackers got him around the ankle and took him down what looks like mike is on the outside the speed of the oklahoma state receivers remember their start three freshman wide receivers tonight theyre starting to play a little bit tighter on the wide receivers and starting to pressure <person player="tony veland" race="UNK" position="DB">tony</person> <person player="cedric jones" race="UNK" position="DL">jones</person> a little bit ivy will kick the <person player="reggie baul" race="UNK" position="WR">reggie</person> ball it was the deep man jackie no protection on the funky a year ago hard return there that was an excellent punt you like your punt to be to hang in the air as long as possible with good depth and that s exactly so he s back in the game for second series down jerry im sure he welcomes the opportunity to play a little bit number 22 blocked in the back there they missed it turner gill the quarterback coach i think you have a problem when you got two great quarterbacks because you cant stack them on top of each other anyone can play you only have one football and you try to keep both of them happy this program keeps guys happier than any program ive seen role players they wait to play their junior senior year they do a good job of that second five whole binary freedom seconds why 20 sure made the savings angle the first thing you seen in an early ballgame is when your team gets tired they get sloppy and when they get sloppy they start missing tackles watched oklahoma state on defense here good they made four characters but number 98 lorenzo <person player="ahman green" race="nonwhite" position="RB">green</person> just couldnt get straight enough to make the tackle look like he s a little tired <person player="damon benning" race="UNK" position="RB">benning</person> six carries 52 yards so far nebraska is already rushed for 221 roger whoa paul has to feel like he s the most fortunate wide receiver in the country when they throw him there s nobody around him but he s overrated and he also made a catch yet and just a half and fate couldnt keep his footing on the first play in brooke behringer overthrows him here so but again that s the playaction pass because you mentioned the rushing yardage please know that 2/3 of the club pride of bill <person player="clinton childs" race="UNK" position="RB">clinton</person> everybody comes up second and 10 and a flag down here itll make the tackle im a 25 john the federal colonel was blocking downfield looked like he had a couple of hand pulls of an oklahoma state jersey interesting about federal he played in south dakota in gregory as a junior and senior a rougher over 1200 yards over the years and still had to send a tape to nebraska just to get a chance to walk on here and i looked at their roster there s a hundred each preparing your to <person player="lawrence phillips" race="UNK" position="RB">phillips</person> in the black roscoe 9 yard line wait on the top of the hole chance once school starts throwing this football to them and be a part of it it will be third down in less than five third downs been an option down for nebraska when it s a nightmare for a thousand the stadium gone that s a nightmare <person player="ahman green" race="nonwhite" position="RB">green</person> meds detangler you got be a little surprised to get to the corner you figured somebody where you gonna be there makes you forced to do one thing or another they blocked it that s the load principle they block them in john petro who had the holding call just a minute ago number 25 so they have to keep up third down has been an option down you see number 25 of that block not debra made up for the play he was called to holding he blocked the safety who was coming up to make the play on from barrington watch stops on the first down with five minutes in 17 seconds were going in barring her only seven and oh as a starter you can hardly criticize anything youve done no and up to you there s a third quarterback on this team that played a pretty good part to success those injury played by <person player="josh cobb" race="UNK" position="RB">josh</person> <person player="ahman green" race="nonwhite" position="RB">green</person> who diagnosed that play very well didnt go with a flaw went back after the receiver they put pressure on brooke bearing her there he was able to try to go back and hit<person player="lawrence phillips" race="UNK" position="RB">lawrence phillips</person>josh <person player="ahman green" race="nonwhite" position="RB">green</person> a freshman linebacker sixfoot to 10th there youre getting some playing six yard line until number 90 you work against the option youre going to face that fullback he s the first threat for updates coming in for you 10 30 and 50 iowa state down to ohio you out of american contract another big a team playing tonight bird in five debra lynn hold onto the wideout those plays are so slow developing youd think somebody would be there to stop it what is once they break the line of scrimmage it s over again i think the defense of oklahoma state is tired theyre playing sloppy theyre missing tackles cris <person player="chris dishman" race="UNK" position="OL">dishman</person> number 75 63 310 pounds junior youre going to see him out here lead the blocking <person player="lawrence phillips" race="UNK" position="RB">lawrence</person> folks just cutting up everybody runs past him number 53 table of blank just tries to reach back and make the play and cant make the tackle <person player="lawrence phillips" race="UNK" position="RB">phillips</person> in his first heisman trophy salvo nine carries on 25 yards three touchdown here in the first that s not a bad performance on a night when is 29:7 let s go to dr jerry punch have been there tom 29 7 nebraska rw mcquarters is the man in the three man formation line drive kick makes the tackle on special teams mike it s interesting the quarterback rotation in nebraska working tonight because theyve got a far superior football team to be interesting when they get into a close football game of how that works for them and next week they play michigan state 90 michigan state s would be surprised the big ten i think theyve theyve got three tough ballgames michigan state s going to be the first one for them itll be an interesting game at east lansing oklahoma state takes over deep in its own territory the tailback and macfarlane wasnt having any other took too long to develop just like my sentence there when you swing the option out and make them run laterally you have no play octavia mcfarland number four has time to read it from his free safety spot to make that flight there was only one d and development death for age 44 to go in i havent the second in 19 of the yard they said to argentina confinement and he got him again back at the three the third stack for nebraska and thomas has been a terror in the backfield well the interesting thing im thinking about right here now a third down i figure oklahoma state s going to run the ball here youre gonna watch <person player="tony veland" race="UNK" position="DB">tony</person> <person player="cedric jones" race="UNK" position="DL">jones</person> fake but nebraska is not reading the fake at all jerrod thomas number 93 makes the play but i think oklahoma state will run the football now who comes back in at the quarterback position does tommy frazier return them after two sir is that way being a game plan i dont think this point it makes much of a difference do you know but it does the number of plays theyre gonna get in the ballgame and phrases got to be thinking i worked hard to get the number one spot i want the majority in the snaps you now want to play i want to be on the turf timeout 250 to go first half break that him to tail the bruins and the hurricanes plus all this force in the highlights and an update sperry much looks a little cooler in the studio guys get the airconditioned all the time oklahoma state facing a third and 20 on the tone for you the brasco become the brass still waiting for at this time jeff oh god no tonight <person player="matt turman" race="UNK" position="QB">matt</person> bevin makes the tackle

theyve got a block from the outside very high but short kick and takes a nebraska bounce will be down at the 34 yard line a punt of only 29 yards and this is from the allbig a punter let s see how the layoff affects tommy frazier i wouldnt think hed miss a beat take a look at the number of plays tommy phrase youre 26 snaps brooke been good fraser with plenty of time to grow she s got his hands on took a little bit too long to throw it with football tommy frazier was waiting for his receiver to clear trent fischer should have picked that one ha tommy frazier with the little fake to his tailback<person player="damon benning" race="UNK" position="RB">damon benning</person>chief just takes too long and he stares down the receiver and through a little bit behind him john bedroll number

s knocking on the door again just so many weapons they committed to it here s the gift of the pullback now watching this tackle to the liveaction gain of maybe a yard as they go straight up the middle of the 3rd one has been and cant get in and nebraska uses its second timeout with 103 left in the half it s so dangerous down here in nebraska what they can do to you it can power you and run right at you with the tailback and we need to pull back<person player="brian schuster" race="UNK" position="RB">brian schuster</person>on the line theyve got the option threat of tommy frazier were you trying to drive ever all your defense éclairs inside then there s always the playaction paint pass off of the fake the run we talked earlier about the timing the way nebraska makes it made it look easy didnt it certainly did again the option so tough on goal line defense reversed out wasnt even touched can you watch nebraska they took the touchdown team right off the field there s no celebrating it s just that s what they expected to do get in the end zone thirtyfive seven buskers cris <person player="chris dishman" race="UNK" position="OL">dishman</person> with a great leave blocked almost all night from his left ankle spot miss brown for the point after noxon through 36 7 in the brands alone im talking about<person player="chris dishman" race="UNK" position="OL">chris dishman</person>number 75 he made two key block on this touchdown center everything around there and <person player="aaron graham" race="UNK" position="OL">graham</person> who is the center theyve built a pretty impressive offensive line nebraska s scored 30 here in the second quarter rw mcquarters waiting on the kick a couple more of the homeless paid games in the future just to watch rw before coming up at halftime well have chris fowler lee corso and craig james theyll be reporting on the donut bowl with ohio u and iowa state miami against ucla a preview of that one and that he won seconds to go they have my mentor the young man who was here and it s just a tremendous safety and back in there and youre talking to pop rw mcquarters a safety in what reason he made his decision to come to oklahoma state as they said he could play basketball for eddie sutton who loves basketball a lot of teams wont let a player play two sports always thought it was great to let him play too but that s the reason they got him here at oklahoma state promised him that he would be allowed to play basketball that was one of the concerns coming in for tom <person player="cedric jones" race="UNK" position="DL">jones</person> the offensive coaches he only had one guy who would ever been in a college football game as a receiver i think theyre gonna have to use rw mcquarters on offense just looking at their ballclub they need a threat on the outside somebody to be able to get the ball to they got a lot of young receivers out there but i think youre gonna third and 10 nice one to stay on his feet and get out of the grass saltzman the junior pool wichita falls texas tom osborne may feel he s had enough there in the first half because he s letting the clock though he still got one timeout left my clock is sitting at zero so obviously it was under the game clock and i just putting the left time run out here against oklahoma state pretty classy move i thought by tom austin big first half for the nebraska offense the ground game up and running in the first game of the season and at the half it s nebraska 36 oklahoma state 7foot stoner chris fowler first bounce 15 to 3 oklahoma state defense off the field brown to kicked him a quarters and rw with a chance from the 1 the quarters pounds is way over the 25 to the 26 let s go to dr jerry punch jerrod guys at halftime at oklahoma state locker room was more like a classroom he s got a very very young ballclub and bob 7 said you know youre only going to get better when you play against the best and theyre gonna get awfully good tonight for theyre playing against the best or one of the best in college football the big concern for the first half was the fact the offensive league they were not attacked when they were making very inexperienced mistakes by over running the football allowing the speedy nebraska offensive backs to cut it back and run it long mike and jerry they did exactly that thompson and renier will start in the back well covered by<person player="eric stokes" race="UNK" position="DB">eric stokes</person>the left corner when they bring our dozen in the quarters into the ballgame youre gonna see him run off the field now he s the target the first play they brought him in they threw the quick screen now they try to hit him on the street but i think eventually as this season goes along youre gonna see number 17 rw mcquarters on offense and a little bit more as he gives you a big weapon good play by <person player="harry stamps" race="UNK" position="OL">harry</person> <person player="eric stokes" race="UNK" position="DB">stokes</person> the quarters was behind him im brave richardson checks in and tailback moving along the offensive line and may have been alonzo mays the tight in who moved first everybody points that song have to be found his defense the way the plane and their initial deemed of season may s a big kid sixsix 252 full target with that 6/6 frame officials talk facetoface for facebook song that can intend after the exchange in penalty which the comic blocked it again had to have a breakdown in the pass protection there because <person player="jared tomich" race="UNK"

player="cedric jones" race="UNK" position="DL">jones</person> throws the football he s going to get some knockdown obviously a playaction and out his good tonight richardson gets it up to about the 29 yard line but still seven yards shy of a first down on third down it s like oklahoma state is conceding third down they dont want to get themselves in a bad situation they know the pass protection is not good right tonight <person player="tony veland" race="UNK" position="DB">tony</person> <person player="cedric jones" race="UNK" position="DL">jones</person> little shaky but hey when youre behind 36f you got open it up a little bit more i mean you got to forget running on third down start throwing the football ivey is on to kick the <person player="reggie baul" race="UNK" position="WR">reggie</person> ball ivey is average 41 yards a kick on for kicks tonight last year he was ninth in the country holding four yards apart nearly got there almost backed up he s got a

position="RB">lawrence phillips</person>is back in there and i back tiger is the quarterback lorenzo <person player="ahman green" race="nonwhite" position="RB">green</person> number 888 table a block makes the tackle let s go to jerry punch doctor guy spoke with odds word and a half time tom husband about the first half of the cornhuskers ask him is there anything at all he didnt like he said not really was very pleased overall with the performance he said that in fact you probably come out of the second half and keep tommy frazier in the ball game because we get a seafaring or some maybe even turnable some but he wants frazier to get some stats from ever he only played three games last year in the regular season left er is volatile hed like to get some experience possibly throwing the football jerry that s a good point with he s gone meet johnny <person player="cedric jones" race="UNK" position="DL">jones</person> the most experienced corner the best cover man well jerry said it the reason you keep tommy frazier in is and i think we may have our first celebration call here but i think the reason you keep tommy frazier in is to throw the football youre ahead by a big margin but this quarter is youre throwing the quarter you want to throw the football in this quarter because you dont want to wait till fourth quarter when youre way ahead tommy frazier on playaction faking the option<person player="reggie baul" race="UNK" position="WR">reggie baul</person>who had some trouble early in the game he does didnt have any trouble here gets behind johnny <person player="cedric jones" race="UNK" position="DL">jones</person> <person player="cedric jones" race="UNK" position="DL">jones</person> i ball off to the races <person player="cedric jones" race="UNK" position="DL">jones</person> got caught looking at the quarterback yeah you see everyone right by him he s thinking option he s thinking all of a sudden im gonna come up and make a play on the option they should have been thinking 76 yards because that s how far that one went and it s 42 7 the problem was working on your passing game is hip hip throw a touchdown on the first pass play you dont get a whole lot of work on it after the defense to do something and i think we are there was a flag down and it has been picked up and i havent heard anything like it s the first celebration call on espn im sure to be followed by many chris brown with a pole dancer and it s 43 to 7 <person player="reggie baul" race="UNK" position="WR">reggie</person> debate grade point average on too proud to donate $3,000 to the brass with general scholarship fund on behalf of aaron <person player="grant wistrom" race="UNK" position="DL">grant</person> rw mcquarters for the kickoff return out to the 24 i said i like the celebration rule but i didnt like that call i think there s a judgement in there and ill that was a poor call i mean that was hardly an outrageous celebration was it that was hardly at all and he raised his hands and i mean cant a kid get excited all about scoring on a 76yard touchdown pass not allowed to but i think there s a middle road on this i said i like the ruling i really do but i dont like this call stuck his hand to this crowd and that s that that s the reason he got it oklahoma state stars over its own 24 jawline and trimming by <person player="jason peter" race="UNK" position="DL">jason</person> jenkins let s go check in with chris power chris guys the big story in baseball a detroit barbie keene we came over there for the big trade allstar shortstop war number six right feel it do you need a gun for and as they have to throw the football here <person player="cedric jones" race="UNK" position="DL">jones</person> throws in the flat grenier cant get to it you said thirddown was the worst to play against nebraska i wouldnt be too thrilled with first and second either well not tonight not tonight it hasnt been a good down on any play both sides of the ball bob simmons is opener tonight not going the way hed like it but he knows his futures he had got a young football team and i think the people around here know they have to be patient with us you cant do it overnight no matter who you are i be 60 punch nebraska has yet to get any significant return yardage of<person player="reggie baul" race="UNK" position="WR">reggie baul</person>driven all the way back to the 25 gilroy johnson the corner came down to make the tackle big dam college football on saturday our early game at 12:30 a nice football team and when you get an experienced quarterback in those first two weeks of season the system <person player="lawrence phillips" race="UNK" position="RB">phillips</person> is the i back rage around the option now theyre gonna say he s out of bounds well a couple of inches and he s gone nifty cutback tommy frazier waited to the right time to pitch the ball to<person player="lawrence phillips" race="UNK" position="RB">lawrence phillips</person>only the sideline stopped him going a longer way i still think this is going to be a series you see <person player="lawrence phillips" race="UNK" position="RB">lawrence</person> <person player="eric stokes" race="UNK" position="DB">stokes</person> the 911 rushes 134 yards 122 average but i think this is going to be a series that tommy frazier throws the football it s time to throw deep over the middle and to hide the whole line who was open what made that play the ball him in the tommy frazier and again watching him in the spring he has taken a lot of pride in the ball handling his pepper he s a complete package with a nice run mike he played eightman football but their high school tremendous worker he came to nebraska as a walkon tailback they told him today it would feel like he had enough speed to be a tailback they moved him to fall back and here he is starting in the first game of the 95 season good running a building here tried to use the straight arm get out of bounds good run pretty good balance for a fullback and his career he s been stopped once behind the line of scrimmage and that the ninth the brass fifteen yards are better bridge on the pass out controllers a complete bovine has two down up to 24 yard line jerry let s go to the doctor i was talking about tommy frazier what a difference a year makes i talked with turner gill the quarterback coach said last year in the early years tommy frazier used it to arms trick he would go back and was very nonchalant about the pass route and he s an armpit to try to force the football this year in the spring tommy concentrated on making of reeds and backed off on not forcing the football at his word five yard line nebraska and mike you have to feel the oklahoma state defense is just whipped out there right now theyre wore down i mean they they now are catching people on the offense to catching blocks their business tackles that as i said before though if we started this thing this freshman linebacker eventually football players but theyre not ready for this attack tonight if you have faced one attack that s the toughest the defendant nebraska for our young freshman linebacker first in goal nebraska already leading a forty three to seven place your on the wall staff set throat touchdown bedroll the wingback came across and was wide open and frazier throws for the score john bedroll got a scholarship just about a week ago he was a walkon did such a good job in fall practice time osman rewarded him with a scholarship and now he has a touchdown reception to boot misdirection play against the linebackers again in the secondary fake the <person player="lawrence phillips" race="UNK" position="RB">lawrence</person> thoughts you see how it opens up the middle john petro number 25 just sits down in that open hole on his own and catches a touchdown pass chris brown who must be getting weary on to the point after knocks this one throw and the wind went out of the oklahoma state sails in the second from the third quarter in the last 18 minutes in 10 seconds nebraska has scored 44 points rw mcquarters at the 6d bright spots for this bhagwat breaks a couple of tackles fights for yardage who gets up to the 28 yard line let s go to jerry punch doctor once you win it your people expect you to win it every year it s as simple as that david thompson in a tailback john throws over the middle and complete for a first down out of 41 to alonso mais bobby when youre watching this ballgame what impresses you so far about nebraska theyve never changed i mean they just just always good i think they probably got a solid up is always good my bobby bowden s going to kindly stay with us for a while <person player="cedric jones" race="UNK" position="DL">jones</person> gives it off the constant attack <person player="larry bush" race="UNK" position="DB">larry</person> arnold number 23 made the tackle bobby i thought danny canal last year improved more than any quarterback i saw last year from game one the game 12 house he performed here early in the fall for real well year ago going the grand try to get the first down and get near the 49 yard line before his push down david thompson and coach joe were gonna have you coming up beginning of november or thursday night november 2nd on our thursday night football against a very very good virginia club you had to shoot a little bit you saw what they did up in ann arbor well yeah it was very amazing ball game a game this is like virginia just dominated three quarters and then did what they were capable and it looked like to me the big differences virginia at the end of the game had nothing left to rush the passer and and that that gave that young man a little too much time that s always a good game coach florida state in virginia will have it this year on thursday night at charlottesville so we look forward to seeing you up there coach yeah hey coach thanks for joining us and good luck to you on saturday hey thank you well see you later yeah thank you bobby thank you jerry must have a pocketful of quarters dinner on the sidelines incomplete line for terrence

dennis sean love had a step on him and tripped in the crowd thought it was because of contact i think it s a good nocall i didnt do because i think their feet got tangled up leslie dentist the cornerback for nebraska watch it here i dont think he interfered with him no i think you just fell down i think good call my agent dont be held hostage seem to be in the top five and has a chance i

interesting now with a new playoff format takes over near a dome 13:5 gives off to the pull back brand and have a chance is blocking the stuff back in the backfield luther hardin number 58 was in there a lot of the backups playing for nebraska now the starters may be done even on defense the thing about nebraska when they go to the second team they dont seem to drop walker a lot of depth this nebraska team and bobby bob is florida state dean have probably the most depth of any team ive seen the last three years comes the blitz <person player="cedric jones" race="UNK" position="DL">jones</person> under pressure leading with john <person player="ahman green" race="nonwhite" position="RB">green</person> receiver on this club because 12 a year ago nobody else back on the roster he talked more than that good pass protection by oklahoma state <person player="tony veland" race="UNK" position="DB">tony</person> <person player="cedric jones" race="UNK" position="DL">jones</person> against man coverage was able to get the foot learning to be let s check in with chris fowler chris what he had got the wild game on a night mike eastern kentucky in central florida in orlando the colonel s are trying to come back this is william morels second touchdown run of the night just about two minutes to play central florida which plays florida state later this year leads by eight back to you all right thanks chris the quarterback for eastern kentucky slated for that game tonight was tommy luginbill the former georgia tech quarterback bill <person player="brian lewis" race="UNK" position="P">lewis</person> is here tonight former georgia tech coach doing this game but he started him last year in the arizona game so i believe he s the quarterback for eastern kentucky and he played bright that georgia tech go on the ground and thompson crosses the 45 maybe picks up to thompson the junior out of okmulgee oklahoma is the pokey from muskogee er no now muskogee is a different deal now what where s he found okmulgee all were oak mulching at the neighboring town must go i wouldnt know the only questions you ever ask me are ones that are unanswerable you know he caught octavius mcfarland i think counting his money as he was running across the field hed better be counting his teeth now octavius number four blitz is on me and coverage nobody on the quarterback <person player="tony veland" race="UNK" position="DB">tony</person> <person player="cedric jones" race="UNK" position="DL">jones</person> family watch octavius number four is counting his money boom shawn love is only 511 180 pounds he loaded on octavius now hell get ripped when that tape is shown on sunday bob simmons may show that about five play first intent and <person player="cedric jones" race="UNK" position="DL">jones</person> comes toward the sideline he wants a timeout for oklahoma state let s go to jerry punch doctor guys talking about the impact of ncaa sanctions here at oklahoma state now they went on probation a fouryear probation in january of 89 now prior to that probation they had two consecutive 10win seasons after that it took them three years to win a total of ten ball games and you said they lost five scholarships a year for three years and off the total of fifteen scholarships off my question is what see what 15 scholarships did here in a program that have been winning ten games a year what could happen in alabama who could potentially lose 30 scholarships twice the penalty that affected oklahoma state well jerry that s a great point that would be devastating to any program as we pointed out earlier with those scholarship losses when bob simmons came here he had only forty six kids on scholarship the way it works not all of them are good players guys you want to use the cupboard was bare and if they do that to alabama whether justified or not where this is just a hypothetical situation you literally take a chance to destroy the program what you do and that s why i think s wrong if the abusers had a hard time getting back oklahoma state s had a hard time getting back in your panic punish into future players find the university to $3,000,000 it s going to hurt them that s why funny guys were three school and a half things happened and bob simmons continues to pay the price for it in his first game the oklahoma state coach macfarlane comes up from his rover spotweld scared they did not make mistakes octavius mcfarland he got the cobwebs knocked out him a little bit ago you know so he s alert now he s gonna try to punish them back a little bit because he took it yet from shawn love that took too long to develop again mike when you run the sweet play it s got to get up in there outside the tight in this longer it goes outside worse chance that s got to be affected and nebraska s always been known for a size but we talked about this last year one of the reasons they could win a national championship as they changed their philosophy not too long ago they knew they needed more speed and they recorded speed they did it after they were beaten by <person player="riley washington" race="UNK" position="WR">washington</person> several years ago joan yen alonso mays against the defensive back he s a six six 252 sophomore sophomore and this is what you like to see if youre bob simmons your team s not quittin theyre trying to get in the end zone here s alonzo mays on the slope delay erik <person player="eric stokes" race="UNK" position="DB">stokes</person> number 16 with attack while in nebraska secondary youre looking for good things to build on that s what youre looking for positive things that you can find in this game and stay positive with your team and weve seen some good things from the freshman sophomores can i talk the home plate and that s exactly what bob sam s going to publish on with johnson 12 carries a hundred seven yards on the night two touchdown run 148 they got him outflanked with that motion rodger pfeiffer the tight end was able to move up inside get a key block but bobby simmons and les miles the offensive coordinator with a good play call he sees it tight in in motion theyve got nebraska outflanked david thompson into the end zone for the touchdown austin vaughn on for the point after out of his home support he went to 56 to go and one of the few opportunities for the spirit rider of bored bullets second look at the touchdown run look like <person player="larry bush" race="UNK" position="DB">larry</person> arnold number 23 the outside linebacker on a copley ohio get caught inside he s a former defensive end octavius mcfarland again taking the hit by david thompson that s craig bohl the linebacker coach so one thing when youre on the road like is you dont want to put a patch away too early you want to keep getting momentum dont want to go into next week game against a game against michigan state by having a bad third or fourth quarter kenickie demand among <person player="ahman green" race="nonwhite" position="RB">green</person> are deep that drives 66 yards to 3 minutes and 42 seconds off the clock and certainly the most impressive drive oklahoma state has managed to put together tonight mike<person player="kenny cheatham" race="UNK" position="WR">kenny cheatham</person>who s back as the kick returner is six foot three and he quit high school team because they ran an option offense it did he is the first three games he quit they talked him back into coming out told him hed catch the few more passes and his coach showed him all the letters standard letters and talked him into pursuing college football who loves college basketball arizona ucla everything from basketball and where does he end up nebraska where as the wide receiver he s got block that s right over 30 years of 35 yard line coming up later on tonight mike and i will be selecting our wrangler players of the game going to be a tough choice on the nebraska side isnt it who you leaning toward right now nobody i should have said coach godfrey will be selecting our player again no i think it s going to be between one of two players okay got the boat brass media people can fly true was leading the blocking again and you just again miss tackles theyre just a little bit tired in the secondary and theyre not making plays rw mcquarters missed the tackle last six possessions what s that punt doing great if youre tom osborne but look at the drives and look at the time they have had eleven plays tonight that have covered fifteen yards or more which is devastating makovicka says ii makovicka is the new fur by the freshman the brother of jeff lester johnson making his first catch of the night for more all stay back theyre on the sidelines and you talk about the competition of the two quarterback is it gonna be tough for frazier and <person player="lawrence phillips" race="UNK" position="RB">phillips</person> competing for the heisman will they split votes off the same team i think they will i think tatami frighteners in the best position because he s the quarterback on the tenant gonna throw and run but depends on the number of plays he s on the sideline penn state had that obvious problem last year the quarterback in the running back three much tear comes in that play was slow developing real slow talking about when he dropped out of this football team is high school coach cleveland and when we joined the team that s when cleveland dansby totally said you have a career in football young man youre a good track plan a good basketball player but football may be your game two times state 200meter champs and arizona <person player="ahman green" race="nonwhite" position="RB">green</person> mange grows field is in on the stop gate gross field beat the block of the offensive lineman was able to get into the backfield and make the play on that he s a junior 64 255 pounds iowa state coming back in the fourth quarter big win for appalachian state now central florida wins it by 8 put a lot of points on the board against eastern kentucky perennial team there s the puss <person player="brook berringer" race="UNK" position="QB">brook</person> banjo because he had such a strong army who robs the football side of the wide receiver picks the ball back up and is able to have a strong enough gun to get it out there to the wide receiver he has a strong arm and a great time in the 40/40 snaps tommy frazier 18 for the backup quarterback behringer s past efficiency rating blasters almost no harm pull back has the first down down to the 23 earlier that s what theyre trying to do again with this drive oklahoma state foot points on the board you want to come right back for them and keep in mind that tom osborne has a lot of questions to answer about his backup players what are they going to be able to do this is the perfect opportunity for him to be able to find out meanwhile that s the end of the third quarter here at oklahoma state nebraska legion super bowl oneill and sportscenter right after the football game then baseball tonight at midnight eastern time well have highlights of oneill s and knight nebraska playing long ball with the cowboys let s go back to stillwater and it just got longer chris is<person player="ahman green" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ahman green</person>scored on a run and it s 56 for to the information 5714 and the huskers approaching 600 yards in total offense in this game i think the concerns that people had about losing for the five offensive linemen certainly may be unfounded they have had no trouble tonight in pounding out the yardage or<person player="aaron graham" race="UNK" position="OL">aaron graham</person>the center leads the blocking they dont have a lot of depth in the offensive line but their first six players are pretty strong im on <person player="ahman green" race="nonwhite" position="RB">green</person> just was strength trying to get in the end zone good block by<person player="brian schuster" race="UNK" position="RB">brian schuster</person>number 28 there s a good look again in the end zone the strength of the legs of a mine <person player="ahman green" race="nonwhite" position="RB">green</person> and fisher and williams who tried to make the hand tackles and couldnt bring him down you can tell theyre just dog tired after playing the entire game poor tackling from about the second quarter on for the oklahoma state defense but again theyre what theyre just tremendously worn down the answer to score again theyve had an answer for everything that oklahoma state has done tonight drive took over three minutes and it s 57:14 nebraska michigan state coaches after i watch this game theyve got a pretty good football team a little bit different up the east lansing next week now there s a little bit more but nebraska s going to play next week that we cant scalp nebraska this year so they cant have anybody here but im sure theyre watching this game thinking about putting together the coordinator the corners from the 80 gets at the 23 yard line let s go to jerry punch guys i want you to get a shot at head coach karloff run for the brassica take a look at his hands now his left hand it has a wedding ring on oh what s missing from me the right hand and surgical championship ring wearing it you gotta believe that sort of not his style he s a very quiet unassuming very unpretentious individual and you think the guy was twenty two years to get one hed wear it but howard s not gonna flow any ted things awfully heavy well you know jerry he always contended that that wasnt to be all and end all so maybe we shouldnt be that surprised that he s not wearing that ring but he s certainly earned it put together a tremendous program thompson s had a good night he s run the whole part not well good block let s enter brian hope number 56 but if there s a plus tonight i think for oklahoma state it s the tailback position andre richardson david thompson both strong tail backs that are going to gain some yardage in the big eight tonight about 45030 season totally yards an oklahoma state is justin over the 200yard <person player="mark gilman" race="UNK" position="TE">mark</person> against the reserved for the basket defense who wouldnt matter then werent getting any 2:44 now people might ask why arent they throwing in every down there behind so far they want to stand with something they want positive results see an interesting play here watch the fullback jeff brenda this is how to block on the option play or on the isolation watch the pullback right here he s going to lead through on the linebacker that s the way to play the isolation to if youre the linebacker down bring a 61 to 44 the good size fullback that was a good courage endearing handling the line back there on that play thompson now 14 carries 128 yards he gives another chanakya sidesteps one down mike coleman came up from the secondary and two breaking up the foil mike coleman the coil was rolled up on that side and planned receiver right in his face as soon as the toss sweep came about he was right in the backfield with good run support he s a hundred sixty pounds 400 i hope that doesnt become real pop would that s what we need for your punches buddy down the sideline <person player="cedric jones" race="UNK" position="DL">jones</person> straight back to throw under pressure down from wichita falls texas on the third defensive tackle this fresh he s on the field able to go in and make the sack on <person player="tony veland" race="UNK" position="DB">tony</person> <person player="cedric jones" race="UNK" position="DL">jones</person> and that s the fourth of the night for nebraska just beats the block

race="UNK" position="WR">reggie</person> ball his back at his 25 <person player="reggie baul" race="UNK" position="WR">reggie</person> balls dangerous weve seen him tonight a 1 touchdown reception

dont know what the call with <person player="matt turman" race="UNK" position="QB">matt</person> sherman is the new quarterback for nebraska runs the option the nice run by <person player="tim carpenter" race="UNK" position="TE">tim</person> back to the last punt nearly blocked<person player="terrell farley" race="UNK" position="LB">terrell farley</person>s going to come in from his outside position and there s a way to block a punch stop it right there see what you want is the defender to put his hands to take the ball off the foot of the kicker<person player="terrell farley" race="UNK" position="LB">terrell farley</person>knows how to block kicks he is he ends right there extend he just barely misses it but i can tell you one thing if youre a coach that s gonna play in the brass this year you better be able to block him he understands how to block kicks he had 22 blocks in two years in junior college 22 either puncture field goal <person player="joel mackovicka" race="UNK" position="RB">joel</person> makovicka number three fullback gets the carry there is falling and some people do have the knack that was the best you ever had i had a lot of good players i dont want a couple good ones at cincinnati george jameson who still paul yeah and the pros just clicked the lions now the chiefs he was very good at it antonio gibson to play for the saints was good at it makuhita the ball terminal short to the wrong guy he had a bad breed he had the right receiver but he needed to pump and go deep with it because the corner droid johnson just sat on the play that determined coming down the line of scrimmage here s the throw but there s no receiver out there the only receivers number four troy johnson oklahoma state his receiver took off down the sidelines and was open just had a bad read youve been with us all night you know weve been giving you scoring updates all throughout the process the time specifically ten minutes after the hour thirty minutes after the hour and 15 after the hour andre richardson the tail back behind <person player="cedric jones" race="UNK" position="DL">jones</person> and they run the option what you got to do if youre bobby simmons though you cant let this game affect your whole season what you have to do again is go back find the good change and and start back to the practice field tomorrow and get ready for the next ballgame because youre up against the team it s a machine theyre a good football team and you learn from this game and you still have a very positive season and simmons is a very positive person whereas i second mile on the road it s nobody knows pretty tough day to be joey brought it up about how they changed their style <person player="riley washington" race="UNK" position="WR">washington</person> came in with that forehand front and they had moved defensive backs the linebackers linebackers the defensive end in nebraska copy that they said hey theyre pretty successful at this front and get the speed on the football field and they made the move about three four years ago to go to a more attention it s resolving the national championship with a pretty good team in they were able to play through the conference schedule once they got to the ball games who were overwhelmed by that speed scene lowered his head went over jamal williams alonzo mays has been the biggest offense at oklahoma state his hand tonight pretty good target is only a sophomore see release inside no one picks him up some protein coverage right here safety get down lower lonzo me when i ran over eric warfield number three maes three catches 57 yards richard <person player="travian smith" race="UNK" position="DL">smith</person> deep man behind grenier players jump all over the place <person player="cedric jones" race="UNK" position="DL">jones</person> to debut in defense of their national championship good cornfed young man dont watch the now nicely designed quiet if they said to pull back grenier in the flat and <person player="cedric jones" race="UNK" position="DL">jones</person> hit him in a hurry mike i think theyve tried to throw that past about four times but there s always been a defensive in there to knock it it s been knocked down twice tonight <person player="tony veland" race="UNK" position="DB">tony</person> <person player="cedric jones" race="UNK" position="DL">jones</person> just lifted the ball over the defender had it more of an alley here to throw for the touchdown thatll help this confidence junior quarterback not flat in a defenseless position as he puts the kick up and he was hit by mike pullman the corner coming in trying to block the extra point and lawson vaughn is able to get sauveur at the 20 and hoppers way out to the 36 let s go to jerry yeah guys you wonder how soon bob 7 staff will begin working to put the pieces together tonight well theyve already begun work yeah im actually in the coaches offices in the east end zone and behind me is dan wasnt hunt who s the video coordinator he oklahoma state he has already begun breaking down this game film playbyplay that s she does it for two reasons first of all the coaches are going to want to see this film painful as it may be after the game but also the big 8 requires all seven officials to view the game film after the game with the exception of late night games and of course tonight they wont have to view this sale but hell make this film you will give it to the officials in the game is overactive a shower and they will take it home and eat the entire film during a game is makovicka breaks a big one and there you get a look from the outside of that viewing booth video coordinators have become very important in college football in the pros to end whisenhunt used to be at north carolina state he s outstanding in his field spot the ball up to 24 yard line another first down for nebraska 843 to go in the game jeff flake the number5 splitend makes the picture throw it like there s some good deeds as we did george in south carolina raid gulf georgia team did readin where theyve got some real good defensive linemen thatll be a good ball game miami ucla miami start brian collins is down there watched a little tape for the coaches they got some good young makovicka what s a run up the middle sports center jimmy up dan patrick and mike tirico well catch you up on their college football preview of what s coming up this weekend all the highlights in major league baseball and a day in the life of terry carmen dives inside the 5yard line needed to get the memory for a first down <person player="michael rose" race="UNK" position="RB">rose</person> field was in on the tack you cant forget about penn state s offensive line theyre supposed to have a great offensive line michigan plays illinois this week i think that michigan s got a tough time up to the line simeon rice party has a pretty good defensive player michigan s offensive line certainly showed it to pass block in the second half they really did it was a great comeback against virginia totally dominated play sim dominating goes right up the middle for the touchdown ive heard people say you know nebraska wins by these huge scores tom osborne guilty of running it up i dont buy any of that he runs his offense and if you cant stop it really that s your problem well a tough thing is you only take 60 on the road so then all 60 these guys play so it doesnt matter who s on the field two pretty good players and you really worn down oklahoma state they are not a factor at this point in defense and he has played all of them the point after is good and nebraska s lead goes back to 43 theyre ahead 64 nebraska in a rough over oklahoma state in the season s opener for both ball clubs 6421 huskers thompson before the time trying to pick this way through traffic it doesnt get back to the 20yard line 651 yards in total offense tonight for nebraska oh 651 we saw carl james here earlier both of us know him nice man great guy and i dont like them im a tradition aside like i stay with the old id like to see southwest conference differently well youve got for three months to go outside jeans maybe a yard authorities inside linebacker spot ramon out of camden new jersey lot of new jersey lawyers on nebraska s ross theyve always read well in new jersey even got some walk ons to walk all the way from new jersey to nebraska turnpike didnt go that part it uh well i think they get some side roads i know the toll booths dont extend all the way over there quod running 643 and counting that s a tough throw to make in juggling unpredictable there s another happy big eight team tonight iowa state has snapped at 13 game winless streak they win the donut ball the battle of teams that were winless last year 36 21 over he would hope theyre pretty be a pregnant catered lunch for the donut baldwin i would think theyd have a big celebration in ames tonight third and nine for for mistake dr jerry punch down on a very hot sideline jerry oh yeah we got here god put me to sup dave <person player="jason peter" race="UNK" position="DL">jason</person> <person player="jay foreman" race="nonwhite" position="LB">jay</person> continue defensive tackle you saw him a minute ago going to break he has a mild sprain into the right ankle in fact the anterior part of the right ankle and <person player="jay foreman" race="nonwhite" position="LB">jay</person> just wouldnt let paul and sandra dickinson back in new jersey his

nobody there one receiver one inside one one out and joe s threw it in the middle the espn message machine is hard at work here with the 6421 score more movement along the pockets of the defensive line another flag is down with 542 to go in the game who would you vote for player the game for oklahoma state theyre asking me who i like i threw out mazes named alonzo maze and your guy thompson rw mcquarters he did some good things i tell you what our w mcquarters is going to win win a lot of player in the game awards in his career but i think thompson jeff <person player="ahman green" race="nonwhite" position="RB">green</person> ea played well if you back that were gonna were gonna hold it just a little longer over tabulating the vote there between you tease you you jerry punch tom punch down there on the sidelines with jerry and myself well get a both youre pretty soon all right remember i dont get a vote im not making it mister i see they away richardson gets the midfield complete sidewalk doing 536 before we have to make this boat because richards is trying to make a good effort here he heard a hamstring in camp and has been slowed a little bit better pretty good evening tonight so on tackle coming up the corner mike coleman young man who was injured earlier and comes back in the game this time another the passing game in the first half like would take a little longer to develop he s a real short sensitive throw it s been better in the second half but remember they having a little bit of a russian game to help but <person player="tony veland" race="UNK" position="DB">tony</person> <person player="cedric jones" race="UNK" position="DL">jones</person> has had more success throwing on first down for only 44% his pants still under 50% but against the world class different bro sis wide of shana love and that doesnt mean theyre going to walk through those other games but they should be a big favor than all those games so theyve got a couple of picks three of them to do before they can be undefeated again second and ten for joan the draw richardson dancing is way down here the 45 yard line where leslie dennis s in on the stop what me to play with jeff <person player="ahman green" race="nonwhite" position="RB">green</person> ye number six to pull back again with another key block for the tailback this young man has played very well good a jerry punch doctor guys were trying to figure out who should be the player of the game in fact my buddy tom here just biting his nails we really cant decide there s been so many people out here as i said i dont have them vote so coach it s on your like okay well we got so much good chatting though again what a pretty tackle<person player="jamel williams" race="UNK" position="LB">jamel williams</person>shot through got him around the knees and dragged him down they just keep bringing them in linebacker he s for deeper so now williams with a good pictureperfect tackle wrapup drive through here s the tackle number 25 andre richardson seemed to drive through the legs make the tackle wrap up bring the tailback fourth down between two and four yards thompson is gonna tailback goes to throw oh man they just keep bringing them in put me on offense coach jeff old guard number 97 ball thrown to soft he was able to bat it up in the air keep it alive now he becomes a fullback i look at the balance on that guy 20 hundred and ten pounds races behind him to make ahead stumbles and retains his balance so nebraska takes over again the number4 tailback on the depth chart with two and a half minutes to go in the game the only thing i can think of it s going bad tonight for nebraska as they got a long bus ride ahead of other than that yeah but itll be pretty happy and even the faithful they have given it up here at oklahoma state people filing out of here but they came to see the new era dawn under bob simmons they saw that they saw a national championship contender take apart their football team but better days lie ahead for oklahoma state administration once again<person player="ahman green" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ahman green</person>who passed on notre dame and michigan and was said in some circles to be the best tailback working in the country and he comes in here and he s got to wait to play as the number 4 tailback and they say he tested better than any player they ran the speed test the vertical jump come on <person player="ahman green" race="nonwhite" position="RB">green</person> youll be hearing that name for days and years to come makovicka
