race="white" position="OT">long</person> time for the first time maybe even generation were legitimately excited about what the dolphins do when they have the ball on offense why but all starts with their quarterbacks had any i think he s the best prospect theyve had since dan marino he s got experience he s well trained he can make all the throws and he s tough they also went out and acquired one of the most feared receivers in all the football sixfootfour 230 pound <person player="brandon marshall" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brandon marshall</person> even you can complete passes of this guy <person player="josh barrett" race="nonwhite" position="DB">josh</person> off so what i like about miami the most is they can run the football they have two great new backs <person player="ronnie brown" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ronnie brown</person> and <person player="ricky williams" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ricky williams</person> and if they get in a shootout tonight with the new england patriots they have the firepower doubts for yet and they have the defense to go against who hatreds defense showing some cracks were gonna get into that in a couple of minutes but ill uh come back to what <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> told us when we met working last night ron he said you know up maybe it s different from

<person player="wes welker" race="white" position="WR">wes welker</person> three very unique tight ends with a skillset that separates them all and oh by the way they ran the ball for 200 yards last week behind a very good offensive line so tonight but at the embassy is a highvolume offense from <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom</person> graydon to patriots they <person player="kyle love" race="nonwhite" position="DT">love</person> that no huddle offense the uptempo and they like that note back in the backfield five wide receiver look get the ball out quick from the

they are rebuilding especially on the defensive side running back to miami time now before tonight s winning look presented by jcpenney to win against the patriots you need to throw the ball right now because ron you start to talk about this group the corners the four corners on the field tonight in their first second or third year theyre very young yeah and they are really unsettling that secondary theyve given up seven touchdown passes through three games and bill belichick is looking for the right combination as it found it yet here youll see the jets exploit with a slant and go <person player="darius butler" race="nonwhite" position="DB">darius butler</person> you cant make it this easy on your quarterback and wide receiver and then with the jets a they came out little bunch look they want to create some doubt in the defensive secondary spine youll see debbie mccartney right there just looked for this back to the backfield my goodness that s easy then youll see <person player="brandon marshall" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brandon marshall</person> the beast as we like to call him you play off and this is last review for the broncos against the patriots you play

<person player="chad pennington" race="white" position="QB">pennington</person> was acquired in the preseason it s gotta get somebody in here to be the quarterback penny got to learn by watching <person player="chad pennington" race="white" position="QB">pennington</person> and then now the next step was the transition after <person player="chad pennington" race="white" position="QB">chad pennington</person> got hurt just anything but straightforward as a good offense for him it s a balanced offense and he spends a lot of time under the center he s in the shotgun less than any quarterback in the league he s comfortable right here underneath third and 11 and time he s becoming pick up she s quarterback friendly but it starts with the past protection no one is near <person player="chad henne" race="white" position="QB">chad henne</person> on this play as he drops back youll see no one knowing the wide open lane to throw the football on to let the defense expand then come back underneath of devon vest and i talked about quarterback friendly there you go saddle down give the quarterback a nice target to throw to they then take it on field gotta make the tackle people working accepted good job im rob nick kibbutz you smelled that out of a linebacker from purdue big saw penny that s great preparation by the patriot defense theyve seen this motion theyve seen this action theyve seen this play action pass but take a look at nick of itch he s going to be over here on the right side drop it into coverage take a look at his outside linebacker off the screen but he read and all the way and made an excellent play on the ball but that s a pattern that im sure the patriots worked in practice all week and inca pitch is an outside linebacker did an excellent job running vertical with a wide receiver their first career interception for ninka gates drive for the patriots jarvis green ellis cut it up got about five yards looking belching toast about this kid out of new orleans st augustine high school where he asked about greenhouse he always seems to pile forward he s not a wow guy not a speed guy but he gets what s blocking it maybe a yard or two more but back to this office that you would call this a bill belichick type player one of those quiet guys just goes about his business and does things the right way undrafted free agent we held on to the block and there goes three nellis to get to the first down what i <person player="kyle love" race="nonwhite" position="DT">love</person> for the patriots is the tempo of their offense <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> gets up to the line with time to take care of those veteran things well there s an urgency in the way they substitute these guys come on and off quickly there s an urgency in which <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> ends the plays call to the huddle and there s an urgency in which they break the huddle but <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> will snap the ball inside of five seconds more than any quarterback in football they play with a great tempo time in dolphin territory let s sneak one more play in thomaston the bat was here in my ability got it we cannot get back to the line of scrimmage they ran that little tight end around last week and handed it to <person player="aaron hernandez" race="UNK" position="TE">hernandez</person> stand try to shuffle it out to him they lose yards as the quarter comes to an end he dominates the first leading 7 of it on monday night football what s <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> on monday night football go for a little bit of history going for 100 wins in his 130 first start montana took 139 he s the standard bradshaw farm manning none of them will equal <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> s quick route to 100 <person player="jake long" race="white" position="OT">long</person> as <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom</person> gets that win in the next eight games he s sitting on 99 right now hey guys think about september 10th at <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> remember that was the day at the car accident on the way to work thankfully everything was ok with that he drove back home for the four years 72 million dollar deal yet as he told us last night he still has a chip on his shoulder i <person player="kyle love" race="nonwhite" position="DT">love</person> being around <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> here s a guy that s accomplished about everything you want to accomplish a quarterback and he still plays angry he does carry that chip on his shoulder from being a sixth round draft choice to start the quarter gets it close to the 40yard line <person player="cameron wake" race="nonwhite" position="DE">cameron wake</person> when it s out on the 48 million bucks without the chip off my shoulder <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> i if there s one guy in the world i wish i could beat him i mean he has it all he s got everything you want in a superstar quarterback he can make all the throws he s sparked hardest worker in the he s one of the guys this guy is a crunch time performer and when he gets the ball he wants to score every time he has it he wants to complete every boy s a perfectionist when a third is short here ha oh he s going to lead the way from the fullback spot and green administration by <person player="kendall langford" race="nonwhite" position="DE">kendall</person> lankford its fourth down very much in the bill belichick profile to go for it on fourth down and they will $10 the scoot around the dolphins have a lot of injuries in this defensive line you know <person player="tony mcdaniel" race="nonwhite" position="DT">tony mcdaniel</person>s suspended for this game <person player="phillip merling" race="nonwhite" position="DE">phillip</person> murli got hurt and preseason their firstround draft pick <person player="jared odrick" race="UNK" position="DT">jared</person> i drifted out so bill belichick clearly feels like he has an advantage and we all know bill belichick greenie keeps the legs driving well say he s got the first down close to the 38 he does now is a concern of coach tony sparano coming in here tonight they are very <person player="matt light" race="white" position="OT">light</person> at the defensive line physician and theyre just going to surge right behind her right guard stephen neil cant cope in the center they let <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom</person> pay to get it done with his legs at sneak wedge and cope and without standing block of the 37 green ellis <person player="bobby carpenter" race="white" position="LB">bobby</person> come preserve that stop but there is what we talked about three more as he keeps the lakes grinder to see the patriots right now from a scheme standpoint of calm things down they came out early they opened it up they spread it out with empty it wasnt working there was pressure on <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> if you spin this more they want to do is calm things down then ill get back to opening up try to get the big plays the explosive plays to <person player="wes welker" race="white" position="WR">welker</person> or masya green ellis carries yard shy of the first down remember the dolphins have a new defensive coordinator here mike <person player="nolan carroll" race="nonwhite" position="DB">nolan</person> and mike <person player="nolan carroll" race="nonwhite" position="DB">nolan</person> was in denver last year did some good things against <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> and a patriot offense but the one thing the dolphins want to eliminate this year is the big place they gave up 57 completions last year 20 yards or more clearly theyre almost deron new england to run the football <person player="josh barrett" race="nonwhite" position="DB">josh</person> see mike is with the night as the head coach defensive coordinator denver last year once respected defensiveminded not only the linemen blots for green ellis was the first down at the 26yard line he got a like ben jarvis green ellis i mean this guy s carried the ball on a how many times but they tell me he s never fumbled and he s waited his whole life for this opportunity just a hard run right off the left side and he really gets it done after contact he makes a lot of hidden yardage his ben

the 21 here is hey this pass is incomplete now michigan for all its great football they really didnt have a starting quarterback in the nfl out of michigan until jim harbaugh started in the late 80s

third and six patriots bring five and heavy throwers complaint another third down picked up for a first down devon fest yeah chant any real poise at the pocket youll see bodies flying around him and he steps up in the pocket this is the quarterback you know where the pressures coming from he steps up and delivers down the field offense and the eyes the quarterback so critical first he looks down the field steps up and maintains that focus and vision on the receiver and throws a strike the best it helps when devon best friends in a rout like that if im vest is off to a great start tonight theyre signing someone for a first job what a hit on best buy he held on to that he s been going backwards wow he gets what a merriweather s an interesting guy reads it the whole way that s impressive

first down brandon out of bounds 23 yard buster a lot of <person player="randy moss" race="nonwhite" position="WR">randy moss</person> is problems tonight or <person player="vontae davis" race="nonwhite" position="DB">vontae davis</person> theyre clearly working the other way <person player="jason allen" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jason allen</person> who s been in and out of the lineup at corner and safety theyre working him on that right side lambie s gonna stop him here on defense get themselves sorted out we have two dozen dbs or their head spinning his <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> s walking it down the beaver patriots in field goal range 26 seconds left first down few <person player="wes welker" race="white"

player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> grab his facemask and look to lost it was the old marino big spike in they almost caught it <person player="vontae davis" race="nonwhite" position="DB">vontae davis</person> was very alert on the play he did not bite the face mike stayed in with <person player="randy moss" race="nonwhite" position="WR">randy moss</person> and forced the throw to the outside by <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> a <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> s dead every shot in the floor eight seconds one timeout grady steps up is set theyll get the timeout here left hell go attempt come let s watch for <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> on that play a moment ago always be alert that wily old veteran <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> saw him shake the face mask that was tipping <person player="randy moss" race="nonwhite" position="WR">randy moss</person> that he was going to come with the back shoulder throw ball just behind him he may have been able to stay inbounds if he caught it for those who are overly crump s are just for those who dont remember famous dan marino play going left to right as the old metal lance against the jets the fakes spike and then throwing a touchdown against the jets one of the best moments in that afc east rivalry and was almost pulled off there by grady and lost one and a halftime show coming up with chris berman chris mortensen adam schefter as well fast is three minutes to talk about the jets will be seen next week michael vick update and jay cutler injured last night as well toyota halftime show coming up 30yard field goal for castouts key timeout taken by miami the house first half you know it not not really the slow that i think we expected both ways miami s move the ball better than we thought but new england until this drive it hasnt really kicked into gear i also think miami s looking forward to getting in there at halftime talking to their young quarterback he s been fooled a couple times he forced a couple balls with no protection and those two interceptions are the turning point in this game going one will be happy to go to the locker room down by one point and find a way to get the ball to <person player="brandon marshall" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brandon marshall</person> feature him a couple times they need his energy a bad snap from <person player="jake long" race="white" position="OT">jake</person> <person player="jacob ingram" race="UNK" position="LS">ingram</person> a moment ago that one was a little bit better angus now ski pounce it through from 30 yards stanza miami 7 new england 6 <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> and the pats get the ball to start the third quarter now the toyota halftime show and chris berg 7 6 <person player="brandon marshall" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brandon marshall</person> <person player="randy moss" race="nonwhite" position="WR">randy moss</person> held without a catch first time in about a year for both of them well talk more about them as we get going but spin ahead here to the second half where are you seeing the england getting more offense well theyve got to keep doing what theyre doing theyve got a sustained drives take what they are given new england has just got to play better in the second half they have not been a second half football team however they get it done they want to win on a road to do that they got to play better football in the second half you know when you look at miami and dan handing their offensive coordinator he s got to get <person player="brandon marshall" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brandon marshall</person> involved he wasnt targeted he hasnt caught a ball i mean he s a guy that brings great energy to your offense when he s in the flow of the game the guys feed off him youve got to feature him in this second half it s an interesting game for both teams with the jets leading the division at 3 &amp; 1 both teams have a loss to the jets so essentially he lose tonight and a quarter of the way through the season youre a game and a half back within your own division v <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> and

ways to move him around and get him open but he seemed very thankful that best was available to them unable to be so active also spoke with a bill belichick about <person player="randy moss"

perceived lack of effort and times during that game your read on that <person player="josh barrett" race="nonwhite" position="DB">josh</person> i dont think there was a lack of effort he made a great effort before he ran the fade route and i think the quarterbacks got to be aware that a guy just ran 60 or 70 yards and dont make him the primary receiver go somewhere else someone that is fresh corner again <person player="ricky williams" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ricky williams</person> is a tunneling walkers as an excellent call watch the offensive line slide to the left and <person

broken up by <person player="kyle arrington" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kyle arrington</person> the 35 yard line field goal try coming like to see the dolphins it s something positive theyre these field goals these 52yard field goals not only are they difficult to make but the penalty for missing this field goal youre really setting up this patriot offense in great field position well johnny wouldnt be in this position if you pick up the blitz and that s critically youve got to be aware of that and that was that was the killer of this drive it had the opportunity for a big play with <person player="brandon marshall" race="nonwhite" position="WR">marshall</person> singled up it should be a career at one wilcock return is blocked again patrick turn the clock it s alive especially yes time for the patriots that s the trifecta for scottie obrien a new england patriots on special things special teams making play after play after play not only creating blocks but creating points

field goal for scores im sure well be getting that statistic shortly our guys are back there in the truck lightening it out well see if history is made here this evening but see the disappoint with the coaches they had a little wrinkle in that play with gentlemen in there they were unhappy when he came out with the kick by kuskowski 20point special teams night two blocks this one special teams destroyed the dolphins hopes here tonight and credit to the patriots where theyve been able to do on that phase of the game as well <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person>

little job he did he got the ham gotta block the ball forward that allowed for the scoop and <person player="kyle arrington" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kyle arrington</person> to take it all the

race="nonwhite" position="RB">ricky williams</person> yards first down here with a minute and a half gone by in the fourth and what the dolphins must do itll speed it up a little bit now but you got to keep taking what the defense will give you the first score is critical you dont need to sling it 50 yards down the field work it down the field try to get one touchdown jane <person player="brandon marshall" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brandon marshall</person> who was kept out of the reception column in that first half this is where you need your best pass protection the patriots are content

brought him up off the corner with the blitz if he <person player="ricky williams" race="nonwhite" position="RB">williams</person> took a hard hit once again a patriots are rotating a lot of players

race="nonwhite" position="DB">mccourty</person> out of rutgers and this is a group that gave up all those foots to buffalo and then you watch buffalo against the jets in the old men s patriots defense must be bad but there are growing steps in ron you make a point about belichick defenses over the years and his vision is for the last quarter of the season not the first quarter of the season he likes tinkering figure out what he s got look at the young players come up with different packages he s thinking what s he gonna have when he goes into the playoff that s how florida the thinker bill belichick is might be a step in that direction tonight <person player="danny woodhead" race="white" position="RB">danny woodhead</person> and lost to on the carry there to compensate yeah but <person player="danny woodhead" race="white" position="RB">danny woodhead</person> man as he made some plays tonight take a look at this he s in the backfield oneonone against carlos <person player="karlos

at that clinic with bill belichick last two years ago i was doing all the clinic speech and he was in the gators office watching film and he watched those gators practice for two days and he told me that had a lot to do with him drafting those players i got to see him practice live i saw him interact with their teammates he drafted three florida gators that are all starting form bill belichick does and you write john that doesnt happens at nfl head coach out you see the guys practice see them lives you can make a cheese evaluation there s a rookie for miami coop me see who brings down <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> hell be no gain but you see what <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> did there in that situation two hands on the ball protect it go down just the smart football player that guy no turnovers tonight we said it earlier turnovers and special teams youre going to have a lot to do with this football game a boy have you sultan escos hick ferret pond5 devon fest at the 18 yard line 20 point lead for the patriots you know it s one of the themes here with new england you have <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> you have <person player="randy moss" race="nonwhite" position="WR">moss</person> you have <person player="wes welker" race="white" position="WR">welker</person> but you always have a sense of the rebuild because of what we talked about when we came out of the break all those young guys yeah but youre talking about rebuilt and while <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> s still there rebuilding without <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> and <person player="wes welker" race="white" position="WR">welker</person> and mosque built bella checks done a great job this team is transformed a couple years ago when <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> was a young guy they had veterans on defense and the defense carried the mail but now it s a little bit different the offense is getting it done but i really credit the job bill has done rebuilding this defense i think theyre still in that transformation process yet theyre certainly on the right path kabam <person player="davone bess" race="nonwhite" position="WR">bess</person> there is a rebuild on the run yet the prospective <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> came in last night was talking about this and said we were a bad team last year wait a minute if you dont have these cities and how many nfl teams would like to have your bad season with a division win a playoff loss to baltimore these guys have won 59 games the last five years after they scratch their they won three super bowls in four seasons so it s certainly perspective of a team that knows championships they do davon best again to the 26 yard line but if you look at all 32 teams in the nfl right now youd have a hard time telling me who the best team in the league is and i guarantee you one of them is new england because of that coach in that quarterback down there well it starts that combination you always have to have the guy in the center someone has all the physical tools the hundred wins i believe tonight a hundred wins for <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> and you know it means a lot to <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom</person> you know he it does have that chip on the shoulder for being a sixth round pick he loves the win he loves to compete and i know he got his one bundage win that s quite an accomplishment pop s become here right at the first down marker for miami dolphins seem very content to make first downs here as opposed to trying to get the ball in there for a touchdown they need three scores in a hurry well the patriots are saying thank you every time they run the ball or check it down for a four yard game you ventured to have to take some shots down the field there s it s clock s ticking with under eight minutes to go and youre down by 20 those guys came out dressed like that my two friends guess again yochai the first down darington making those s9 caches here for best tonight these are situations that you always hear bill belichick talking about situational football twominute defense at guaranty he s going to be evaluating his pass rush and their ability to get off the field it s <person player="anthony fasano" race="white" position="TE">fasano</person> the 47yard line and weve been in new england to watch the patriots before monday night games and their practices are just full different situations preparing their guys for moments like yeah mike yeah youre absolutely right is pretty amazing you know we get the opportunities practice and see what s going on with an injured player in the field but one thing about when you see bill belichick and his practice they do not miss a detail every aspect of the game is covered injured players <person player="anthony fasano" race="white" position="TE">anthony fasano</person> the tight end timeout on the field i was international travels wonderful thing a son nick faldo was the last ryder cup captain he was for the european side he s here tonight mike eruzione from the 1980 miracle on ice team here as well a lot of big names and celebs here home team has disappointed down 20 and a 30 reception <person player="patrick chung" race="nonwhite" position="DB">patrick chung</person> to drop kicks and a pick six sounds nice night member <person player="chad henne" race="white" position="QB">chad henne</person> was looking for <person player="brandon marshall" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brandon marshall</person> on the crossing route <person player="brandon marshall" race="nonwhite" position="WR">marshall</person> just stop ill take a look at it john s i think he s gonna run a little jerk round im gonna stop and then he s going to jerk his body but here s <person player="brandon marshall" race="nonwhite" position="WR">marshall</person> on the shallow cross he stops and then he that s you cant do that to him quarterback exactly right once once you commit yourself you got to stay with your commitment and <person player="patrick chung" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chung</person> is an easy recipient right there that s bad ball right there by the dolphin just not on the same <person player="jarrad page" race="UNK" position="DB">page</person> and a quarterback and a receiver dont see the field to same eyes that s what you get six going the other way early secondround pick 34th overall that o9 draft has this second interception of the year is first for a touchdown he had one against tennessee last year against the buffalo last week that what happened in the end zone miss until he took mrs anita or if <person player="mark levoir" race="white" position="OT">mark</person> sanchez has picked up his game to get santonio holmes back boy he s got more explosive wide receivers to throw to <person player="mark levoir" race="white" position="OT">mark</person> sanchez theyre having some fun cuz we know that a run of the ball there s a damien thomlinson very well : caro actually going to get a chance to return a kickoff after 5 touchbacks tonight by gaston skiin would head was a touchdown run has a tackle on special teams at the 32 yard line you know you kind of come to the game you think im <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> and <person player="randy moss" race="nonwhite" position="WR">moss</person> and <person player="wes welker" race="white" position="WR">welker</person> and the difference makers tonight have been nin kovitch <person player="danny woodhead" race="white" position="RB">woodhead</person> and cheung <person player="danny woodhead" race="white" position="RB">danny woodhead</person> making plays on special teams he s contributed in a lot of ways he had a big block on <person player="brandon tate" race="nonwhite" position="WR">tate</person> s touchdown as well all over the field of young fellah the miami dolphins have a lot to think about neither pic man in there now at quarterback this is one your head coach tony sparano he s watching the sidelines very carefully he s gonna watch the demeanor of these golfers and make sure they finish with with as much as they have <person player="tyler thigpen" race="white" position="QB">tyler thigpen</person> in at quarterback picked him up by a trade since kansas city last year he almost throws an interception intended for javon best he was at coastal carolina when they started the football program down there and took him to a thirty and eight record as they got that thing off the ground and then he played a significant amount of time for the chiefs in 2008 started 11 games they were 1 in 10 and was the bottom of where the chiefs were before the turnaround here the last couple years the big been traded here <person player="chad pennington" race="white" position="QB">chad pennington</person> as the other quarterback some chances for thick been here tonight shot down the seam way too tall for a <person player="mark levoir" race="white" position="OT">mark</person> line you got to hit that one well you got to hit that one this what happens when you bring in a quarterback that hasnt taken a snap in a regular season game in a while can owen hit <person player="brian hartline" race="white" position="WR">brian hartline</person> wide open down the seam and he just air ball that one it s a setback for <person player="chad henne" race="white" position="QB">chad henne</person> then playing well three interceptions tonight clearly the last one not his fault but he knows when you play a team like new england turnovers well there were mistakes in that first half job to report decisions pigpen take it off here is gonna get the first down <person player="jerod mayo" race="nonwhite" position="LB">mayo</person> has been involved in 15 tackles tonight help make the stop there <person player="tyler thigpen" race="white" position="QB">thigpen</person> was adopted last year guys he played in one game was at the very end of the season against the steelers in a mopup role was four of eight night game and threw a touchdown you know mike youre always looking for that guy you know a skillset that protects the nfl he has a big arm he does have some ability he just lacks that experience he had some good performances with the kansas city chiefs it was a poor team but he did open some eyes and thought he was able to do <person player="anthony fasano" race="white" position="TE">fasano</person> the catch there in 44 back to <person player="ricky williams" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ricky williams</person> tackle by chunk for being informed very tough stretch ahead as we mentioned for miami after this week they get the off week and then have the four teams that are among the teams you would think were playoff teams before the season started the patient s gonna take their last timeout on defense defense takes them all for 50 to go by the time outs out of challenges these teams have split their season series five of the last six years so the dolphins gonna have to try to earn the split up in foxborough this year at the end of the season on january 2nd this pens past too tall and was complete were frustrated harlan we talked about the stretch coming up after the bye it s a lambo steelers in here to cincinnati to baltimore ouch that s a tough stretch right there you could you can play good football and lose those games you know every week in this league let s be honest it s a dog fighting looking at the carolina panthers they took the saints to the brink yesterday detroit went into lambeau had the packers on the brink 49ers had the falcons dont make mistakes dont turn it over dont beat yourself up being so clean by paves yes interception and another turnover both ports of the night for the dolphins these plays with tragedies this ball his heart line right between the numbers heart lines been open it missed them here they hit him right between the numbers he took his eye off it before he ran nice break by <person player="jarrad page" race="UNK" position="DB">page</person> dolphins have been really poor here in the second half youre being kind he s having any good effect whatsoever and and all phase of their game have contributed offense defense and special teams special teams the most before 36 left remember i was telling you that the big pinned mopped up against pittsburgh these action for the dolphins you know somebody else once mopped up for the dolphins dan marino ron jaworski throw 421 touchdown passes for the dolphins marino for 20 jaws one if the last game of his only season with the dolphins he threw a touchdown pass to <person player="mark levoir" race="white" position="OT">mark</person> late in pittsburgh raced at sea right though they got those right fit were 20 i was talking to <person player="thomas clayton" race="UNK" position="RB">clayton</person> he remembered it what a great throw it was you know probably threw my hitch in your an 80 yards the bubble screen by marino a few bytes far but you guys are together on green bay they said won by jaws and won by scott c cules <person player="thomas clayton" race="UNK" position="RB">clayton</person> career touchdown and they call you an alumni im sorry this is a blow off that we had to get to this stuff fina it s a habit so you dont even get a part of us oh no but don shula was your coach yeah you got to back up marino there that one year yeah well i want to unbelief of coaches human being don shula boy there s there s a rock right there jarvis green ellis to carry well you add up all the bizarre things that have happened for the patriots tonight and you do have something you havent seen in the behind decades of the nfl with the patriots accomplished tonight first team in league history to score a touchdown rushing passing a pick six kickoff return and return of a blocked field goal in the same game there it s i told you when there s history here somewhere about an hour ago and more things happen they got like about this is <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> is still at quarterback yeah and people at home are saying why is <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> still playing quarterback i asked <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> i said how many reps do you give <person player="brian hoyer" race="nonwhite" position="QB">brian hoyer</person> your backup quarterback on the practice field he says none i dont give him any reps unless coach belichick makes me give them reps nobody is gonna take any reps from me im the quarterback period i believe that s <person player="brian hoyer" race="nonwhite" position="QB">brian hoyer</person> over there you know okay can i get on the field a little bit weird <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> go to school this weird warriors go to school this year the state state <person player="kyle love" race="nonwhite" position="DT">love</person> to be out there with his teammates warriors an undrafted guy <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> was very very high and fraser really likes what he s done this a couple of years backing up his green ellis carries the back into the game when jim <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> and belichick together this will be win 100 as a head coach quarterback combo on perspective on that course theyve got three super bowls to go with it only to combo with more before super bowls bradshaw no only at 107 regular season wins and the guys were talking about earlier moreno and shula with 160 get into that super bowl on <person player="danny woodhead" race="white" position="RB">danny</person> s second year i agree get the victory there every great coach has one of these a great quarterback and vice versa i really think it s it s a battery but you have to have the domini green ellis stay inbounds to get close to the first down and well get to the twominute warning here in miami five touched down to the second half by the patriots except youve only done before 1961 and 1980 miami a <person player="jake long" race="white" position="OT">long</person> 13 days to ponder i can tell you this the patriots were not in a very good mood before this game they were pretty stirred up by this and i can say that that guy bill belichick was pushing the button to these guys he dressed them here in the hours before kickoff reminding them of guys are down on you they say that you guys are making too many mistakes youre not going to get it a lot of you guys in this room were passed up he was appealing to that kind of chipontheshoulder mentality and creating some of that cohesion that a young team needs and mr belichick pushed the right buttons here tonight at his team came up with a big effort in the extra areas to get a big road win and a win where randy maas didnt catch a ball for the first time in his patriots career it was all about the miami dolphins that s all he talked about they were one in four of their last five road games they wanted a road victory but bill belichick rallied his football team brought him to south florida and got a convincing win and it found a lot of new contributors he knows <person player="randy moss" race="nonwhite" position="WR">randy moss</person> is going to be there for him but <person player="patrick chung" race="nonwhite" position="DB">patrick chung</person> is gonna feel good about himself and nick a bitch he s going to gain confidence in himself and soul his teammates a lot of these young players grew up tonight with john they werent playing well defensively coming into this game they were giving up over 27 points a game the buffalo bills put 30 on him last week so you know they were making mistakes but i think to bill s defense they were corrective mistakes and he got his guys playing as a unit more in harmony <person player="brian hoyer" race="nonwhite" position="QB">brian hoyer</person> will get to come in as <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> comes out look at that huh that guy s something oh yeah bigot doesnt mean anything that s pretty incidental neat shot i thought it was man that bill took them out i think i think back to the monday night game we did in new orleans you know stuff like what saints clearly when the states clean these guys out there was that shot of <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> and belichick standing there trying to wonder what the heck s going on here were not used to this that guy s on a mission i know that can trash that with tonight i hate to be in his way too so the winkle team that won only one true road game last year one of their other trended road wins was the game in london against tampa bay dominate the dolphins 4114 theyre out next week and get the ravens in foxborough followed by visit to san diego and then minnesota comes to new england to no easy spreads ahead for the pats for their time of the jets for the lead in the afc
