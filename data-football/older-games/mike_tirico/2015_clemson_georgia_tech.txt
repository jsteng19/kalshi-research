============================================================

last week a thousand year storm devastated the state of south carolina but their bow swinging in the clemson tigers were determined to bring life to death valley after jumping out to a huge lead the tigers was still a furious comeback by the irish tapped by a stop for the ages and a new battle cry was born we give you scholarships we give you benson meals in a place to live we give you nice uniforms i cant give you good and i cant give you a heart it s a knife it was big why dont you bring your own gun you you are watching the acc on espn georgia tech has made the twohour drive of i85 to the palmetto state to take on the undefeated and 6th ranked clemson tigers good afternoon everybody mike badger again cunningham it s great to have you with us dr jerry punch people join this shortly georgia tech is off to a 2 &amp; 3 start the coaches say they have found ways to lose games instead of finding ways to win them but historically they have been very good against punched including the win last year and unbelievably it s raining again like it was last week against notre dame for the brown game will be essentially from paul johnson the good news is who still has a great quarterback the bad news is they lost seven running back since last spring but theyre paul johnson it really has been about the development of<person player="justin thomas" race="UNK" position="QB">justin thomas</person>lee i was second team allacc last year played brilliantly in that win against clemson big piece for thomas obviously you have to be a good runner into tripleoption very good in stage this is the best rower by far that paul johnson is having the good news for georgia tech they get michael comers back today and receiver theyve been missing for the last game summer gives them an outside option they havent had and if they can throw and get long coes over the top it becomes very difficult to bring more people down to defend this runner here come the tigers in front of another sellout crowd 80 1,500 fans as they look for their 13th straight win in death valley before they come they rub howard s rock on the hill the jean <person player="deshaun watson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">watson</person> leaving his often down the hill you know last week in the most dramatic fashion than you could possibly imagine the clemson tigers in all that rain with all these people came back to beat another game a game that they were so very long and in doing so that upset win over notre dame some people say love of the month but in that win over notre dame they vaulted the number six in the polls and certainly entered the conversation with the national championship picks and youd have to put them in there because if dashon walked in it became the running game for washington that was great last week so remember <person player="deshaun watson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">watson</person> hurt his knee against georgia tech last year in a game that they lost he ended up having to have surgery he broke his hand against louisville last year and needed some surgery so they i dont expect theyll run him as much even though were in rain again as they did against notre dame needed that for the big win all right when we come back tuck jerry punch with was bottled by the kickoff from hi hi we all know jerry punch as a reporter and a medical doctor but once upon the time he had another job option quarterback at nc state under lou holtz doc how about some insight for today thanks mike and hello everybody you know folks paul johnson spread option attacks as a very few simple goal one his time of possession if you can go in an 8 or 10 play drive and take six or eight minutes off the clock and score then you limit your opponent s position today that means keeping john <person player="deshaun watson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">watson</person> and company s office help the field specially three yards of play do demands i mean support down conversions and system and thirdly write a lull in the sleep when they lose their contain a loser discipline can you beat him on the backside up the middle for a big play offense is very simple to run effectively it is hard to feast on mike alright jerry will refer to those those mandates during the ball game harrison buckler kickoff he has been a very good kickoff man this year and he knocked this one out of the back of the end zone georgia tech had won the toss and deferred so pumpkin has the chance to get the ball first and<person player="deshaun watson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">deshaun watson</person>will bring on the clemson offense last week against notre dame in that downpour he rushed for a fir high 93 yards he thrown the ball exceptionally well this season 11th in the country 69 percent completion rate last season at georgia tech this was the game when he tore his acl ended up practicing the next week they say he tore it even more completely in that practice played against south carolina at the end of the year but then had surgery lecter for the ball <person player="wayne gallman" race="nonwhite" position="RB">wayne</person> waldman tosses the ball back to ray ray mcleod and the spurs across the 30 nice block by bashan <person player="deshaun watson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">watson</person> after he handed it off im not sure<person player="patrick gamble" race="UNK" position="DL">patrick gamble</person>the defensive end he picked the tackle that<person player="deshaun watson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">deshaun watson</person>blocked as he comes back on this reverse was quite ready for excuse me that was robert <person player="zac brooks" race="UNK" position="RB">brooks</person> from gone the defensive end that he knocked down they were about two yards shy of a first down and they are now about a yard shy of a goose down sharan feet got the ball on the perimeter and good inside outside pursuit adam gough is who was ejected in the first quarter first half against north carolina for targeting back he s the best inside player for georgia tech on defense third new york gulman for standing must play then a block on the outside and gold in gold six yards for a touchdown to run through an awesome block on the outside to get rid of the last defender third one for 66 yards you go for the point after and clemson takes a minute and five seconds to grab a seven nothing lead and hallman goes untouched for the game s first score theyre still celebrating that long touchdown run by <person player="wayne gallman" race="nonwhite" position="RB">wayne</person> gulman and why not it was a beauty perfect it blocked to get a bounce identity of the speed like that will kick off to return by<person player="jamal golden" race="UNK" position="DB">jamal golden</person>go back to that touchdown tyler <person player="mark fields" race="UNK" position="CB">mark</person> gordon the linebacker is lined up in the castle he s supposed to be lined up in as he starts to move you can see moves back to the middle now watch the block by hi it with true freshmen and then the tight end leggett as they feel inside and more courted cant get back over the top and then sure on peak right here all sixfootthree 215 pounds against ebay white 511 185 youre not going to get to the outside to this terrific blocking downfield point of the fact a little misalignment defensible miss runs away from pressure wants to throw a deep out and it looked like he overthrew that one on purpose intended pool <person player="ricky jeune" race="UNK" position="WR">ricky</person> choose let s take a look at<person player="justin thomas" race="UNK" position="QB">justin thomas</person>13 and 6 as a starter under paul johnson running this option offense last year set school records that georgia tech for rushing yards and touchdowns as a quarterback this year he has struggled a little bit to the passing game fittingly 46% of his throws going to have to be better than that today too because a loaded with hums the defense thomasson the keeper takes the guys play just about three before he is thrown back this clemson defense a year ago was number one in the country they allowed only sixteen point seven point two games this year theyre allowing 148 points a game with almost nobody back a bunch of guys to the nfl grated carrot vic beasley brent venables and starting with the head coach dabo sweeney theyve gone in a terrific job of not only recruiting top tens on 15 every year but also developing on defense since the takeover availables of 2012 theyre really good in the front line not as deep as they were last year but a bunch of guys have played a lot of oil luring this jackal off inside thomas stop and it s intercepted picked off by stinkers buddy horn plays dangerously on the underthrown path returns it and yard thomas missed his first throw badly and worse he was waist short with this one yeah and just kind of this is not what the georgia tech wants to be doing third long and happy to be brought that passes as <person player="cordrea tankersley" race="UNK" position="CB">tankersley</person> who s just lined up out here squatting down and reading everything that s going on in as the ball is thrown there s two receivers in the same spot actually there are three receivers for georgia tech in the same spot so lotta orange jerseys and the quarterback never looked anybody all and you have that many guys which here goes hallman again breaking tackle tallman to the 30 to the you have three receivers that are that close the ball has no chance to get through yeah if there was either a blown assignment there or that ball should have been thrown a little bit earlier from<person player="justin thomas" race="UNK" position="QB">justin thomas</person>again not the strength at what they do they lost georgia tech lost two receivers that went on to the nfl last year and so they just dont have that part of their game stallman goes in motion has complete sister on feet wide open down inside the 10 yard line 21 yards<person player="pj davis" race="UNK" position="LB">pj davis</person>the middle linebacker had to make this stop and here goes clumps and superfast theyve got to accept on their heels obviously gone they really like him but they would like to see him get his pad level down he runs so upright it takes a lot of scott weve talked about confidence the offensive line which was a huge question <person player="mark fields" race="UNK" position="CB">mark</person> coming into the season played against notre dame last week as well as they could play it wasnt pretty but this guy is starting to get so much confidence running the ball demo sweetie feed yesterday he literally feels like he cant be tackled right now with an offensive line that s growing into itself we mentioned a true freshman a tackle he they really been a fire hydrant plug for them in the middle fade overthrown it would be third down and goal he talked about some offensive line with the injury to<person player="ryan norton" race="UNK" position="OL">ryan norton</person>he was the returning center there are no returning starters on this one that s unheard of to have that and be able to win and it s pretty all the time but cody elliot the play caller says offensive coordinator as long as theyre getting on their assignments which they have been next de guerre mo who had a foot injury last year filling in for <person player="ryan norton" race="UNK" position="OL">norton</person> but as long as they get their guys we have people that constrict everybody s fill it out including the tight end length only time to throw back of the end zone sure on peak couldnt hold it boy he was opening and this is a kid who is loving life right now because he played two games combined or nine games combined in the last two years as of interest and had that great block that you got to make im not so sure that may not have been tipped by <person player="jamal golden" race="UNK" position="DB">jamal</person> bolden nope just lost time through concentration that s at the cuff drop there google the redshirt freshman has hit five of seven so far this year this is a chip shot from about 21 yards snap good hey good kick london has been no problems with georgia tech defense i take advantage of the turnover the building well espn s college football on abc brought you by chevrolet find new roads <person player="christian campbell" race="UNK" position="QB">campbell</person> sweeney dancing after last week s victory over notre dame at least he s the better dancer than i am although that is not much of a compliment well after that big win over a top 10 team we can understand the byod bring your own guns was legendary is dancing better but i understand in his contract he actually has a d incentive to dancing that was a $5,000 fine anything caught on video and shown publicly cost rating planetarium today the mall <person player="jamal golden" race="UNK" position="DB">golden</person> on the return from the thick and he has swallowed up the 16 yard line and all of 1:15 is really turned against georgia tech let s check in with chastity hubbard cassady i might we have an injury updated here we get hard turn away on the first play of the game knicks chubs left legs buckled he was helped off the field and has been attended to all the sidelines neither say a tough injury for the bulldogs mike ship is so good absolutely dont want to see that one again weston 13 the first thing in this office the guys play and they give it to marcus marco flag is down when that s the the first option of the triple reid is to what georgia tech colts the fifa for the fullback in most offenses they get a lot of carries because if the defensive tackle which is kind of a work in progress with munson right now<person player="dj reader" race="UNK" position="DT">dj reader</person>who s a really terrific player has taken a leave of absence from the team theyre not sure he s going to come back for personal reasons they got a good game out of<person player="carlos watkins" race="nonwhite" position="DT">carlos watkins</person>of course who has a great tackle on the threepoint conversion but they dont stop that be back if that first dive is getting three to five yards per carry georgia tech can wear you out it opens up the passing game and it opens up the perimeter run game that was the biggest concern people go chop block on the off hit number 37 after this is two to go and paul johnson is livid stop block of courses when one man is engaged a second blocker cannot come in and cut him and this was clear with a shot blocked by the freshman watch the left side of your screen as the blocker comes through 37 landis davis the defender is already locked up with the center <person player="freddie burden" race="UNK" position="OL">freddie</person> person that was an easy call not quite sure what ball johnson had mine the young running back though did not expect the feta to be there obviously same place same karaoke about the 14 yard line from what this marshall who is a true freshman and there are an awful lot of those men playing for georgia tech including some walkon who have had significant playing time thirteen true freshmen started the season 14 different guys who scored a touchdown in the a back sewer the wings they have walked seven count depth and a backs to injury and those are the key guys on the edge you sent the block they also have to understand why not to cut block if someone s engaged though theyre down to the bottom of their roster and for a place like georgia tech might think ball job has done a nice job recruiting to his system he is the only coach to the power five of all the powerful conferences that runs a through option gear option where the offensive line fires out low occasionally cut blocks on the backside but when you go that then i dont care if youre the university of georgia georgia tech alabama you go down seven players that a convicted offender often and youre going to have trouble third and seven the last kind of situation georgia tech wanted to the end for them it is still running down on a keeper for dustin thomas and that tells you how much they do not respect towards the sec s passing game that they can have that many guys playing the run on third and seventh with the weather the way it is theyve already thrown an interception i think venables felt very safe about the 40 terrific job by <person player="travis blanks" race="UNK" position="LB">travis</person> blank but also beating woodman who dies we were down to separate life the guy who s been fighting back from an acl tear from whole practice last year that he injured earlier in the year these are the guys that fill then <person player="step durham" race="nonwhite" position="DB">step</person> on dancing to the nfl who sort of mission for a thousand fl guys top level guys has played a lot of ball last year <person player="ryan rodwell" race="UNK" position="P">rodwell</person> gets a great bounce on the puzzles all the way to the 22 yard line a 59 yards it for ryan logon they really needed it and there is the flag down on the play after 41 tonight on abc saturday night football presented by wells fargo number 12 forward state against crosstown rival our crossstate rival miami 8:00 eastern on abc interesting across county florida a&amp;m which actually opted over it in miami 4th alabama demo the one the last dive in that series and look at theyre looking<person player="justin thomas" race="UNK" position="QB">justin thomas</person>he looked uncomfortable his face is grimacing the medical staff they they didnt give him attention if they were calling upon everything so maybe just dabangg out but he could not look comfortable there for a couple moments on the front and they georgia tech fans will say this to be understanding that these if they cant lose number 5 debate the goal they have offensive <person player="jamal golden" race="UNK" position="DB">golden</person> of course theyre not going to give up but you can almost the less time if he does that was back up the bug well yes because theyve already lost him by early their other quarterback you play quite a bit short yardage and goal line but youre down to mass majority who was playing running back for a while this season because of all the loss they had to come back with the injury to buy early for things not not difficult defect on left over i watch them in the offense take over at the 11 yard line call me not to the 15 this georgia tech front has always been a little small compared to other major programs but on the defensive end spot this year anand linebacker lawyer least 230 240 pounds equals avenge one or twenty pound linebackers for ped ruth the defensive coordinator this is tough against an offense that can do so many things thanks a gulman they come on throwing complete the pass to the tight end jordan will like it with coaches saying we have to find a way to get him more involved in office he s so good but then the problem is you have a lot of guys who facility there s said roofie were talking to him he s like legis good week theyre getting him more involved we havent even really seen our cave of scott he was a superstar in the first half against notre dame last week ray ray <person player="rayray mccloud" race="UNK" position="WR">mccloud</person> a true freshman they havent even really taken the training wheels off yet but is apparently incredibly good with the ball in his hands the cloud in motion hell get it here lost the ball this is something georgia tech desperately needs a turnover deep in clemson territory no signal yet from the officials all the tech players are saying they have it and they do talk about something they had to have tony eliot the play caller said we wanted to get ray ray <person player="rayray mccloud" race="UNK" position="WR">mccloud</person> involvement residential he s the guy they really want to get in and he goes into the running back and he runs into his own man <person player="stanton seckinger" race="UNK" position="TE">stanton</person> seconder and the ball pops out that is a young player mistake that ball should be up way high on his jazz instead is down by his it to be up across that number three and a huge turnover for flexible<person player="austin bryant" race="UNK" position="DE">austin bryant</person>recovered the ball option to the outside nowhere to go one to that defense for holy cow flying up from his safety spot j ron first georgia tech has and you know we expected maybe broad rich snotty be a back running back to combat for georgia tech who broke his hand a couple of weeks ago but he s not able to play georgia tech does not have the speed at a back those attacking perimeter players to get to the outside this is a lot to ask<person player="justin thomas" race="UNK" position="QB">justin thomas</person>i think they have to continue to work the inside runs through the feedback and if you argue on the opposite make it shorter not as why because right now there s three or four defenders waiting for him plumps them crowding the line thomas going for the end zone it s a jump ball and chattered away mckenzie alexander if you want to pick on him youre picking on the wrong guy when he covered wolf <person player="cj fuller" race="UNK" position="RB">fuller</person> last week he gave up one reception and for mackenzie alexander this is a ball that is thrown late so he s able he s got great position the whole way but this ball just needs to be thrown a little bit earlier instead it becomes a jumbo situation alexander with good long arms terrific practice earn if youre going to defend georgia tech guys on the outside has to win one that look like a big win for clemson last year alexander had more stamps than any freshmen in clemson history when he did it at the corner position and clemson did not like the fact that jay rahn curse or the safety had to walk out to that inside receiver timeout i think that brent venables was expecting another run formation georgia tech came out in a rare passing formation is that ive got the wrong personnel in but let s see if georgia tech now changes the formation personnel when they come back out celebrating its 11th year sponsoring the good hands field gold nets all state extra point kick today allstate has contributed millions in scholarship funds if youre georgia tech right now you have to be thinking 7 points not 3 youre not clemson s going to score it feels like 40 or 50 today so i think third and 12 you dont necessarily have to go for it all you get to fourth and inside five i dont think youre sending now but for the kicker this is a game where it s got to be seven or youre not going to keep up kicking you know i would normally agree with you wholeheartedly so momentum but you anything i mean it is started so badly yeah put the points on it only be down seven weeks yeah fourth and i bet you go for it though oh absolutely but this is a fourth down on going for it machine tomic five men run has time for sidelines too high now fourth and ten the tough call to go for it on fourth in fact it s this bring on your kicker and buncher s out a nice year he was over 2 against notre dame of course both these teams played notre dame ago to take 3 weeks ago in a loss ended up taking it right down to the end the thunder had a tough day then but it s a perfect spent plenty of length to be a 39yard try to get tech on the board they could use any kind of a lip they got to turn over and they got three points out of it as the way were in death valley were clemson s 1 12 in a row theyre going to leg up on number 13 esp a pump of the college football playoff tell you who s in and that s clemson after last week s win over notre dame dis was yesterday was just gorgeous down here the sun made an infrequent visit everybody was happy about that now it s raining again in the state just cant take anymore of course a lot of thoughts would seep down in columbia that are still trying to dig out a lot of the damage that happened through that valve for last weekend three yards deep and theyll bring out to about this quantity to guard on our papacy got and a chance to check in with cassidy hubbard mike let s check out the buffalo wild wings wild play on the opening kickoff jhs it goes 96 yards the house and after an n you free it out michigan tacked on another touchdown the wolverines have a streak of 73 unanswered points at over two days 14 nothing michigan right now <person player="jim brown" race="UNK" position="LS">jim</person> harbaugh hasnt made much of a difference betting 50 key yeah but let s see if he gets past year free knee 10 pull the ripcord pretty quickly i think he s pretty happy where he is right now well dan talent we called them last year defensively they were one of the best groups he saw and you need to make them better on offer that looks like a plan drawn it s on the lot attendant football got to the 30 we check in with jerry punch my georgia tech can ill afford any more injuries but theyve got one free thank you devon smith the fifth year senior out with a leg injury right now that means the freshman<person player="aj gray" race="UNK" position="DB">aj gray</person>and fun just another freshman jerry it just keeps brought them out no matter what may be energized by that turnover and field goal tech s offense warming on the run adam got says the first guy to get there he s good and there s bray and there s 1 to 12 the freshman and if you are clemson youre saying where s the guy in the really really white jersey he s the safety to the right if im<person player="deshaun watson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">deshaun watson</person>i would be making sure i knew where this guy was longfinger too quick final legged beside in he s one of those guys who always make hay in texas and just seems to scoop the ball into his body guys better that they were starting to see bodies like that used more and more in these predators in unique ways it s awfully fun that s announced to the front concludes our table had almost a thousand yards a year ago and that time legged out there as a receiver blocking in front of scott so you take that 250 pound body he s athletic enough to go out receive but he s also now blocking<person player="dj white" race="UNK" position="DB">dj white</person>190 pound corner on a shoe on an easy throw encounter life from the time did it be true beautiful catch by <person player="hunter renfrow" race="UNK" position="WR">hunter</person> renfro 18yard control is the walk on a red shirt freshmen who they are really excited about an atom god s us is showing us why he s the best defense along the fraud defender along the front seventh for georgia tech he got to watch him again but not quite for thursday the back a fondant over batter you lift up about three well this cut right here had to make clemson fans a little leery it was a cut almost exactly like this last year against georgia tech you see the heavy left knee brace that cut right there on this exact type of run against georgia tech last year was when his knee buckled which then led to after the south carolina game him having to have surgery not being able to play in the win over oklahoma in the russell athletic bowl but that had to make the clemson fans feel good that survived that done <person player="deshaun watson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">watson</person> again the quick place craigie on will make this catch and it was one of those noncontact just following a lead blocker and right there on that gut you saw on the left foot right there and then he comes up and buckles and goes down practice the next week week tit again rehab did not play against gorgeous day came back and led the big win against south carolina kind of got that monkey off the fact and then decided to have surgery after that sam inside the five our basis not and god is down in the end zone took a shot at the five kill mall <person player="jamal golden" race="UNK" position="DB">golden</person> drilled him and then he got hit again at the one and looked very similar to the touchdown scott had last week against notre dame knees down he s down to a little short but remember scott split three defenders on a throw and scored to get things going for clemson and that was a clean shoulder hit by<person player="jamal golden" race="UNK" position="DB">jamal golden</person>he s not leading with his head he s not going to the head neck area its body to body but that could not have felt good and i would be shocked if that s not what has him down let s hope he s okay this is a very dynamic player he s so good with the ball in his hands and really terrific student off the field has really developed an icon with the <person player="shawn davis" race="UNK" position="K">shawn</person> washington had become good pals not a touchdown but down on the one and the good news is that wants me to jump in running off on his own power clemson s one of the programs that s kind of leading the way with guys early enrollee they have 15 of their class this year came into spring practice and it s really allowed these guys to excel rulings confirmed on the replay review but what it s allowed a lot of guys like gossipy get ahead in the classroom as well as on the field sure that when they can so many freshmen now are playing it s a new wave in college football but allows these guys to get ahead to two semesters potentially and understand how much work would take to play the game with the young man here last year was just sensational for a true freshman because of that experience<person player="deshaun watson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">deshaun watson</person>has been perfect on this drive five out of five 68 yards bauman is this setback like it s the motion made and move them up front oh they got a timeout before the delay before they go our game timeout clemson their second 30second timeout it s the 329 to go 1st quarter clemson has already used two of its three a lot of time outs in the first half the only thing that has stopped clemson so far is the fumble every other time theyve had the ball it just marched down the field catch a double tonight on espn first at 7:00 eastern college football primetime presented by hilton has arkansas gives number eight alabama then at 10:00 a huge pac12 battle unbeaten cal number five utah both games on espn also streaming live on the watch yes a lot of relation to this program with alabama of course the head coach dabo sweeney played wide receiver at alabama but he has built this program by studying what nick saban has done in alabama it s really impressive what sweeney and this staff and the support they get from the atlantic department the program that theyve been able to build here <person player="clinton lynch" race="UNK" position="RB">clinton</person> it s always been a good program but sweeney now has it tipping over to great theyre starting to beat the brand names notre dame oklahoma ohio state lsu all burned the teams that theyve had to recruit against for years and years theyve always had to recruit against the best against bc now theyre beating those teams on the field which is starting to result in being done in recruiting and theyre willing to play them every year they always have won they always have someone south outside this year milder day hallman that s an effort are they going to give it so many lines edges coming in and marking each short i have a feeling it might be wing bowmen again on second down gulman stumbled good job good penetration by georgia tech defensively that was got the defensive tackle weve been talking about the best player up front weve got some penetration and had him stumble but be shocked the physics in another number nine run so with gulman kind of looks like old school punch them though they may be spread out but when you have a guy like bowman a 215 pound running with the confidence he s running with and an offensive line that it patchwork but they get job done eric book playing the graduate student starting left guard at 315 pounds that the big push up front as well 10 plays 80 yards it took them only four minutes and almost 200 yards in clemson tigers 17:3 the number 16 in the country touchdown back at clemson worth 17 to threeedged you mentioned the bigtime teams they have played back in 2012 it was lsu in the chickfila bowl three steps 25 24 they follow that up allying to be the ohio state 42:35 last december they just slumped oklahoma 46 so whenever they have had the opportunity to take on a big time program in a bowl theyve won they scheduled big time programs every year and theyve managed to win the majority of those those insect will start from this own car bond markets to launch them and on the return to the jackets after the 2012 season as they seek to change defensively and they did was last week and paid off bigtime and this twopoint conversion notre dame decides to rhonda con kaiser they had scored a touchdown on the exact flight notre dame at three plays earlier famed defense lined up they had blocked the personnel go and put<person player="carlos watkins" race="nonwhite" position="DT">carlos watkins</person>over to that side and was bought on the double team they go solo tackle great blow up bipolarity thomas get anything going look at the clemson defense everybody is within four yards too low on the scrimmage everybody they have nothing on the edge right now to make them think that they have to run and get out on the edge so these state bodies this defense when you look at the size of the defensive tackles their linebackers all of these guys are starting to look and feel a clemson like nfl guys at every position and if they can develop from test in a schedule and i think it s manageable on this defense this would be a dangerous squad now they spread them out a little bit and <person player="james barnes" race="UNK" position="QB">james</person> long first ever blow it up and the only way you make a play like that is you have studied so hard all week and you know what the keys are and thirst goes inside the block remember first had to walk out earlier to cover he went inside the block and read the dentist unfair curves at 6foot for safety this is this is not feeling athletically like it s an even match hats off to <person player="brant mitchell" race="UNK" position="LB">brant</person> venable he has taken all these guys who didnt start a year ago and he s turned him into thomas dr bonemender and these two defensive ends can rush the passer is anybody<person player="kevin dodd" race="UNK" position="DE">kevin dodd</person>number 98 or samples the number 90 on the other end that could make life miserable for a quarterback and everybody in orange is doing that right now right now first down is the enemy of paul johnson theyre getting no but you know got punk said three yards per play and if we go for it as well right now theyve lost a yard first down is 03 yards and that you just cant be behind the sticks where they are man the ball hits the courtesan player goes into the end zone phil lose and he goes out of bounds for a safety holy cow well and this is something they have had troubles with at georgia tech they had a drop staff against north carolina they got a snap over the head of <person player="ryan rodwell" race="UNK" position="P">rodwell</person> against booth and here it goes again john <person player="sean tobin" race="UNK" position="LS">tobin</person> throws it right over the head of rod well rod well does a good job like he did against usc picked it and the ball is almost caught theyre unbelievably by guitar johnston but because it s a live ball and then goes out of the back of the end zone ends up being a safety for clemson just get the disastrous here for georgia tech after what for them last year was so magical they went and beat mississippi state in the orange bowl they played so well on offense and now just everything going wrong for them you got to give rod well credit to be able to get away from the rush and get a kickoff anyway was great and then it turned out the best way it possibly could for georgia is a great thing yeah i think what you want to tell rod well in the future though take it on that ball out of the back of the end zone because if clemson gets it right there get the touchdown the momentum change how you give up to you kick it away and now you give up nine four six four kids go it really is a loselose unfortunately for that young man paul johnson said earlier this week i told the players theyve dug a hole nobody s going to come and rescue you you got to dig your own way out the digging is not going well that was jack hoffman youve mentioned how good he is he was working that left arm a little bit so let s watch <person player="shaq lawson" race="nonwhite" position="DE">lawson</person> it is some type of shoulder thing moving it around like you might be sore but god and macleod weighed it 220 for the free kick right now the other side of the hole for georgia tech feels like sighing it feels like they need to just keep digging shot program detection drills for irritable let s check in with cassidy hubbard let s take a look at who s getting to dump presented by wells fargo and jalen hurd did not get it done as he fumbles on the floor but geo hundreds more done because he recovers the football and goes 96 yards for the touchdown georgia up 7 nothing in the firm remarkable for them to have that kind of comeback after the injury to chuck how bad things been for tennessee the offline you have but still two weeks in a row they gave up double digits to lose the fourth quarter for clemson been the opposite against louisville notre dame they gave up ten doubledigit lead but they were able to hold on women theyll lose the yardage here with<person player="kelly bryant" race="UNK" position="QB">kelly bryant</person>they have a couple of packages for him he s an outstanding one or 6:30 to 15 a true freshman and want to get him in a few plays give you some experience and have it ready should anything go wrong with <person player="deshaun watson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">watson</person> knicks schussler is another backup quarterback who they really like but he is he s not as good a runner as this kid watch moves back in and we give this back well it was really an interesting story if he had not injured a book last year he would have been the starting running back from clumsy but the injury kept him out and theyre just now starting to get him back in the scheme of things talking to him yesterday they felt very comfortable with him getting back into that second string behind goldman gulman of course clearly the number one but this guy starting to give them quality depth he was i just said going into last year the starter and when he got hurt that actually let gaulden who was a true freshman moved up the depth chart and end up anytime because were on at the end of the season that is the end of the quarter in all clemson 19:3 will be back after a word from your abc station yeah youre watching the apc on espn for whom the bell tolls right now is holding for georgia tech an awful first quarter theyre down 19 to 3 the only good thing that happened for them is the turnover and a field goal off of that third long big down for yellow jackets <person player="deshaun watson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">watson</person> the time kid that down the middle from the 33 yard line form on offer and this is just too easy and<person player="corey griffin" race="UNK" position="DB">corey griffin</person>who was the safety getting over a little bit late we heard that the monster is out so theyre having to rotate safety he was saying he thought the ball hitting the ground clemson able to get a snap off not sure if it was reviewed here comes the review the way the corn cory grimpen got up and started before the review i started slapping the ground made me think that potentially <person player="germone hopper" race="UNK" position="WR">hopper</person> had dropped the ball can i ask you an unfair technical question could say the ball was already snapped how can they blow the whistle well joe rulon well if he if the referee was before the snap it doesnt matter when the whistle comes so he can take a couple seconds program matter correct well he s got control of the ball all the way through what did come out there when he hit the ground now here s the question it didnt come out here s the question did how many steps does he have this ball it looked to me like <person player="germone hopper" race="UNK" position="WR">hopper</person> may have had control of this before the hit by griffin ball is secured one tooth off field stamper yeah brilliant confirmed and good job by the officials to stop it to play it was a fumble the ball did come out it looked like now he s down so that s not even a fumble so no good good job by the officials to stop it and good job by<person player="corey griffin" race="UNK" position="DB">corey griffin</person>came up and was very demonstrative i think it had an impact on me it maybe had an impact on the replay crew and good job by you to answer my question which was if the snow yeah were done the bugs are sorry not a good job by you remembering my question i am getting older by the second first down at the 34 another is free and another broken tackle <person player="rayray mccloud" race="UNK" position="WR">rayray</person> macleod you start to see that ability by macleod in the open feel the true freshman receiver had the fumble earlier in the game they know this young men s dynamic they just learned for shad <person player="maverick morris" race="UNK" position="G">morris</person> the office coordinator who left to be the head coach at smu they just have such a way with getting the ball to so many different people locked in the crate completion in this minute first touchdown did jordan legged his third touchdown grab of the seat and <person player="deshaun watson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">watson</person> that looks like he s playing seven on seven there s nobody in the way of any of these grown and we steam the ball get to so many different people this time leggett bakes like he s running out and it s the inside route of beyond game that takes the safety out of the deep position wonderful job by legged this thick teens a goodlooking athlete for that bigger than in bed he doesnt even have to unload and parole these past he floated state here s the night beat the ball see you to catch because youre wide open is all numbers 626 of three clubs lenova success now that and any of them so the dust it s gotten ugly early in clemson south carolina 26 three tigers over the jacket oh their paints coming off in the rain it s been nothing but rain of course in south carolina bummer all that work down the drain five yards into the endzone okay for me well take a look pacific life game summary you might expect it has been all rain gulman with a couple of touchdown runs early that one in two hands but she s cool theyre on heatresistant course oclock downfield follow that big hungry offensive line and then of course the passing game is working what did the court interesting dabo sweeney said we havent really had to throw it much this year weve established the loan when we didnt think we could against louisville and against notre dame but he prevents the strength of our office we just havent had done corporate money <person player="clinton lynch" race="UNK" position="RB">lynch</person> flag is down this is going to be hold against marshall on the outside <person player="ben boulware" race="UNK" position="LB">boulware</person> and green or in on the tackle for clemson so where is a blast to watch number can at linebacker talking to brent venables who serves as the linebacker throws a flap on the defense number 85 15 yards first down jane rogers is called for grabbing the facemask right now doesnt it look to you like clemson is listening for the calls for georgia tech georgia tech is so limited because of all those injuries debate the us to the a back position the running back position and there there s just as there s so much speed on the field for clemson on the edge that yes right now it feels like oh the office coming this way there s two guys being right on every play patrick s closes cumber seven he has dinner the fullback position or what they call the be back transfer from stanford has done a great job this year instead they run it wide and finally get some running room with mikkel lands davis the first real chunk yardage play on he has four landis davis excellent job by<person player="justin thomas" race="UNK" position="QB">justin thomas</person>b of boyd and georgia tech got lucky they didnt get a hold there on the left hackle but a boyd the inside charge was able to get the bitch and landis davis one of those prefreshman who s had to set that in play earlier than they expect this to go to pass no and what you have to realize now if youre just tuning into this game georgia tech does not have a 23 point down offense this is not where theyre going to get the hurry up and fling it around this is a very run based offense at all johnson brought up from brought down from the naval academy the only power five conference school that runs this type of offense but they just dont have the personnel or the structure to do much more than continue to run the ball to where they are it s been front for clemson go very yards out of the guide stove of course a graduate transfer from stanford who was it was becoming a blocking fullback in new at a stanford took advantage of the graduation rule and now they come into ball carrier georgia tech doc he has taken full advantage of that senior you know what a difference of principle make three years at stanford he had 14 total carry he had 12 his first game ever elegant and is probably sending tweets out to the stanford teammate saying i told you so well that definitely in these corners now for mackenzie alexander these are guys you just put them out there and youre good and here s a fourth down with georgia tech going for it here this coming feels like<person player="justin thomas" race="UNK" position="QB">justin thomas</person>following the fullback i think trying to get on the outside here or trying to throw rancic oh boy open feel maybe trying to draw more that s exactly what theyre doing for just a pretty good sales job because georgia tech goes for it so often but you can see brent venables on the sidelines going watch out to the hard count but but why are you not going for it here towards them for year down 26 to 3 im going to take the penalty and dimes up now youre going to find i understand that this is starting to feel like he gets away but well mo johnson a guy who goes for as much as any coach in the power five division schools the sightings really strangely on the 40 inside the 40 yard line for that three not to go for it s down 23 well certainly sometimes it s easier up here than it is down there but it s pretty obvious honestly the torch detect doesnt have a chance to stop and this punch is straight up an elevator chair and go sighs oh would be five yards espn s college football on abc walking by four we go further so you can add at&amp;t mobilizing your world ses oh club a tradition down here yes be in the magazine published a international championship for college sports bars the sl club would be our picture to win it all is a legendary place weve been here forever earlier in my career spent a few nights in there of course now we stay way out of town no longer and youve got to make a road trip to get there the state plumpton back on offense where we have been absolutely unstoppable sir on peak makes the mother yet some more on the offense is very fun hey guys when <person player="chad smith" race="UNK" position="LB">chad</person> <person player="maverick morris" race="UNK" position="G">morris</person> left to become the head coach at smu it was a nobrainer for dabo swinney what is going to do in terms of promoting from within that s because jeff scott and tony elliott had been delegated gameplanning duties a year ago by <person player="chad smith" race="UNK" position="LB">chad</person> mars scott was this outing on pass play first and second down and tony elliott was deciding on the run play so debo simply promoted these guys who had been learning from the master and were battletested to become cooffensive coordinator and jerry youre absolutely right about the master <person player="chad smith" race="UNK" position="LB">chad</person> <person player="maverick morris" race="UNK" position="G">morris</person> took one of the most inept offenses we have ever seen and turned it around in one year where they can score on anybody still cant stop people at babies do talking about it at the view going to four that s a tackle you dont want to see no<person player="deshaun watson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">deshaun watson</person>taking at this stage of the game make 26 three they were backed up because the whole i im not sure how many more run calls i would have to not before i let him throw it you know were were not in blowout territory keep old off but the way he s throwing it right now the timing he has i wouldnt want to see him carrying it being tackled from behind like that in a game like this more he just looked at that time there was a little bit of coverage on the completion team our tabas god that was chris milton<person player="deshaun watson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">deshaun watson</person>you mentioned it he really does throw a nice ball he has he has all the arm in the world he had so he can throw a heater if he needs to youre lyin ladies timing is good though if your timing and your feet near actor there you dont have to burn it you dont have to throw it hot and we saw that last week with cardale jones hell throw it in so far and itll be offline right now cant catch it until it s off here up by foot that s actually great for that that s the first bad throw he s made at the feet of <person player="stanton seckinger" race="UNK" position="TE">stanton</person> seconder the backup i did dj wiped us out there on the coverage that that ball was uncatchable land season against georgia tech quite a different story for this offense and theyre going to have to send on the punter well last year porsha john <person player="deshaun watson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">watson</person> went down in the first quarter and closed out who had been injured through the middle of season a lot of people didnt know that came in wasnt wasnt really sharp but the whole team wasnt great after <person player="deshaun watson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">watson</person> went down but where they really turned things around the next week they beat unc play really well then coast out by the inner season just playing great he felt great the corns under and this kid is a tremendous kick returner two years ago before he got hurt he was the only one in the country in the top ten in both punt returns and kick the turf tomorrow morning espn will get you ready for your nfl sunday at 10:00 eastern nfl insiders update you on all the latest injury news and sunday nfl countdown with boomer and the boys usually 5 previews and indepth analysis right up to kickoff at lastminute fantasy information pullback dive play<person player="marcus marshall" race="UNK" position="RB">marcus marshall</person>that s the first one weve seen in that inside run that pullback be back they call it get down the field but an excellent job by tj greene the safety if it breaks through that s why the safeties there s good tackle by 15 good handoff my comment some people who would be sitting at home unfamiliar with this option offense may be thinking youll see why they dont they do something else this is their office they are not going to do something and i think again last year paul johnson at georgia tech coming into the season didnt have very high expectations they end up having a terrific season going to the orange bowl with florida state of course going into the south football playoff they bumped into the orange bowl a great win against mississippi state<person player="justin thomas" race="UNK" position="QB">justin thomas</person>is the mvp of that game but now you see where a place like georgia tech in a lot of places when you have this many injuries that theyve had on offense they start to fall behind a team like clemson athletically very quickly after their first win marvel s the deep man in the backfield davis is in it s like griffin developing and they try to get the edge and they have simply been unable to get the edge against the speeding punch some defense they run cursed a little unfair this guy is 6 foot 5 215 pounds he s basically an outside linebacker playing free safety the only did well there he didnt have wasted steps he read it he froze he knows he s athletic enough to cut he forced the border back to not only pitch it but then had the athletic ability go make the tackle guy who had a little bit of a south fourthquarter gave up a couple of long throws but a forced fumble again floating aimlessly on the 2 yard line last night at a night third and very long and for thomas and georgia tech will have to spend a timeout how many times you seen that for a defensive player the best thing they can do is just stop and look it s so hard for someone like curse to do that but that was excellent technique got a timeout when we come back third and 12 welcome back to clemson now for today s aflac trivia question which had coaches as the best money percentage in georgia tech and clemson district and well give you an extra hint probably ten other schools the fifty did coach a lot of paper and then you replace to that football league gonna hurt four tackles three four losses fullback dive again with marcus one for the true freshman 510 309 and it s been about the only thing theyve had any success with and here you go sending your punt pinna female you got a got a top on the last one after you kick but you continue to kick away and i think the phlegm soon before this app is over the bill punch it in wants if not twice more im not going to ugly kicked the scott and remember this has been an adventure and it s a fake and theyve got the first down out near the 50yard line terrific call that yes it was chase alfred and and brandt mitchell you know you usually have linebackers helping each other out 51 throws a terrific block <person player="grant aasen" race="UNK" position="P">grant</person> mitchell throws a great block for his linebacker made <person player="chase alford" race="UNK" position="LB">alford</person> and that s a nice ball by paul johnson you pump that away there s no way you can expect munson s going to go to flub it again on offense the way theyve been playing a quarterback special again it s<person player="marcus marshall" race="UNK" position="RB">marcus marshall</person>nothing there this time so i think paul johnson has thrown down the gauntlet now where were going to do everything we have to do to try to get back in this game and that includes trick plays in one port on fourth down and he s in his system and so like you mentioned you tune in and youre like why are they giving it to the fullback inside the line of scrimmage down by 23 but they have to do that to run the rest of their office this beer ops would feed beer option is based on that inside run to make for the two deepest of tackles in the middle linebacker play those down thomas trying to hit one out wide open and <person player="clinton lynch" race="UNK" position="RB">lynch</person> will walk in 50 yards and that how this offense can get to you one play of utility after another and if you can get a receiver deep and get your quarterback to hit him you do it one fun that was how notredame started to chip away on that 21 to 3 lead the bunsen in the fourth quarter it s good from the linebacker right there he s got the running back as he comes out legs and length is a guy who dropped the touchdown pass just like this last week against unc so a bit of a turn of momentum here on a miss by the linebacker he was so wide open he couldnt even tell who was supposed to cover i think it was because that s who i think in between man together lendl <person player="clinton lynch" race="UNK" position="RB">lynch</person> sitdown ran everybody they paid no attention to him and<person player="justin thomas" race="UNK" position="QB">justin thomas</person>put his lap and we went back well show you a look of it i was painted look like<person player="bj goodson" race="UNK" position="LB">bj goodson</person>should have been in coverage but as we went back and looked at again it was what brent venables was saying our safeties have got to be able to ring we treed those wing backs when they released and if you watch j ron curse he s the safety on this side and this motion brings him up the problem is he doesnt see the running back slip in <person player="bj goodson" race="UNK" position="LB">goodson</person> has to let him go he s got underneath coverage expecting curse to be there not this is not the linebacker <person player="bj goodson" race="UNK" position="LB">goodson</person> and that was a miss reed and that s exactly presentable said you watch this team you say how do people get so open well curse has been up near the line of scrimmage you mentioned green tackles for loss so far for first so his job so far has been attacked the line of scrimmage then they do a nice job georgia tech slipping out <person player="clinton lynch" race="UNK" position="RB">lynch</person> and get behind it penalty flag before the ball was before they had even lined up georgia tech was late getting a defense anything $5 phase first i think the ball had been marked ready for play by the official and georgia tech wasnt there paul johnson kind of laughing talking to someone upstairs how in the world did we get them but how about the last play 50 yards to <person player="clinton lynch" race="UNK" position="RB">lynch</person> good call almost i got hold their total offense in the first half thank the gulman <person player="deshaun watson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">watson</person> throws than he s ever dated threw it away a terrific job by the quarterback weve seen cardale jones twice this year who s that he s just really struggled and the kind of elite guys with names that this guy has it all he really has a great feel for the game he s got a terrific arm good mechanics has a tendency to fall back some against pressure but hell get better with that only a second year in college ball the preseason conference player of the year the turns ripped up keshon <person player="keshun freeman" race="UNK" position="DE">freeman</person> number 42 he wasnt happy there should have been a route coming back <person player="keshun freeman" race="UNK" position="DE">freeman</person> was a freshman allamerican a year ago playing defensive end at 240 pounds third and long for clemson while some looks to the right double pumps now flows deep but if anything that is offensive interference got in the way that he s entitled to that great position he did not buy there was a a thousand go by ray ray mcleod and <person player="chris milton" race="nonwhite" position="DB">milton</person> did an awesome job in coverage that is not past interference he had positioned the guy <person player="chris milton" race="nonwhite" position="DB">milton</person> who had an interception return for a touchdown one of two last year against clemson to help him that big win up and would you be down in atlanta delicate position of <person player="chris milton" race="nonwhite" position="DB">milton</person> i dont know if you get the same feeling as i do right now the ones that made him relax a little bit on offense it s been so easy and they went real conservative in that heavy rain and could not convert peter knows was given to them by their seasons in the fifth quarter against notre dame but yet has that kind of feel like they were in command and all the sudden georgia tech can cut this potentially to a one score game and i think it s just human nature where things are so easy to speed up a little bit now for the answer to our fy kirby of question which head coach has the best winning percentage in both towards executive lumps in history well of course is john heisman as coached attack from 1904 to 1918 before that he was the coach at clemson and of course the trophy is named after him and almost every stream we go to look in the book john heisman was the head coach he lived for 300 years an option look for justin comment well the only way theyre going to get back in georgia back is theyre going to need to break thomas free on this option right now the only thing that s worked has been a few of those inside run plays it seems like nothing accepted one late bitch where thomas did a great job avoiding the loss at the line of scrimmage but if they can get on the edge and those guys are wrong and his athletic is first out there making it more difficult not sure they can overcome because theyre a bags otherwise the wing backs dont appear to have a speed to get outside on fun mom is trying to get outside who died across the 30s got enough to get the first down and the game trail bunch jacked off in the water this is a fascinating guy because he played behind the all american vic beasley who was a high draft with number eight in the draft the falcons but jack <person player="shaq lawson" race="nonwhite" position="DE">lawson</person> actually has more tackles than beasley did <person player="shaq lawson" race="nonwhite" position="DE">lawson</person> a guy who played terrifically last week against what is supposed to be one of the top picks in the nfl draft at left tackle for notre dame has just worked and worked in working let s much comment you look a little film looks a little not 100% i was walking around back to furrow under pressure got away from one but welcome well bring him down heaven god made him scramble and lofton got him a three and a half stacks for <person player="shaq lawson" race="nonwhite" position="DE">lawson</person> even the defensive line in tackles i know that they lost a lot of guys on defense make sure doesnt look like they lost a lot number one defense last year these are big powerful men up front and this is not what goes effect wants to be having out of state it s just not their strength athlete galore for the bad draw comic the nothing brent venables said about this defect is there tremendous chemistry with these kids and they trust each other and they listen to him and if you think about when venables came in we had him that first season 2012 they went to the bowl game against west virginia and good for us being the orange bowl gave up 17 points venables came in the next year and defensively the places lost he said we had a lot of guys who didnt even know how to read with zone hobson properly and they had to start retraining and rebuilding of course theyve done an amazing job recruiting but they have built what it s starting to look like the people into thatcher and when he came here that first year you can see the pressure written on his face they had all the office they needed but the defense needs to be entirely rebuilt brent venables had left a terrific job at oklahoma was given an opportunity to come here and build his own thing wasnt sure if he even wanted to do it and he got here we met with him he looked like whoa i dont want this job now feeling a little better a lot of pretty boys yeah now well take a look at this week s ap rankings brought to you by goodyear ohio state struggled early as they have all year and then accelerated the end to knock off maryland tcu plays at kansas state baylor at kansas that was a walkover for baylor utah and kau tonight on espn that should be a very interesting ballgame and lsu with the early lead over south carolina that game had to be moved from columbia the beleaguered capital city rather than under pressure both defensive ends all over and really if youre georgia tech let the play clock on the plate before run all the way down clemson didnt want to use their very last timeout now you call a pass play and you throw it out of bounds nice job by sac <person player="shaq lawson" race="nonwhite" position="DE">lawson</person> now youre giving the ball back to clemson minute 47 a little bit less after the punt but because you decide to try to drop back it s just not working theyre not able to block these guys so now you go something doesnt have to use the timeout theyve got the timeout theyre going to plenty of time left theyre not even slowing down in austin and dog and johnson talking to his quarterback about them and i mean poor guy turned around and there s three people learn 90 and above standing in his face and now because them two didnt have to use that timeout and i think rightly didnt use it on the third down when georgia tech let it go down theyve got all the time in the world check in with cassidy hi my taco bell studio update notre dame looking to bounce back from their loss to clemson and this will help dashon kaiser to will <person player="cj fuller" race="UNK" position="RB">fuller</person> a 30yard touchdown 21 7 over the foreign element shipment right now mike cassidy thanks very much we have a minute 36 to go here laughing under if the weighin throws the ball hits the ground incomplete the terrific opportunities for clemson get a repetition of the end of half end of game offense weve got a timeout minute thirty always doing this drill at the easily by the end of the week youre running this two or three times according out of manage the clock when you use that last timeout get out of bounds there as a freshman beyond pain a true freshman who was a high school quarterback so for the first time playing receiver no reason to go for an extra yard there you just got to get out of bounds this is a lot of clock learning for a freshman mistake third down call it to <person player="deshaun watson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">watson</person> with the quick out that s the first down to kane again and now now yet a godel paint has got delayed someone s got a self gain oh boy he s got a hit there there s the late hit after they blew the whistle jake lube or gambit and it s jake s blue morgan who is another true freshman getting some play turn play personal foul 91 be fair 15yard penalty first down you dont want to give the help the clock is starting to burn a little bit theyre going have to rush patrick <person player="christian campbell" race="UNK" position="QB">campbell</person> just back had a concussion two weeks ago through morgan going a little if you cant do that yeah you just cant do that far after the plane what threw morgan did wasnt that agree now ill let that one go and let it go somebody got to get the cane the true freshman receiver and say hey getting out of bounds a little more important than that extra two yards blitz coming they dont get there on the person there dennis <person player="lawrence austin" race="UNK" position="DB">lawrence</person> austen knew he was beaten and figured his only chance was to make a tackle sorry these are feelings first well 15 yarders backtoback and<person player="deshaun watson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">deshaun watson</person>just took a monster hit as he let this ball go clean it was early in the midsection that s adam costas and youre right austin knew it you might as well take the gun if anything if i were dead roof i say hey next time tackle them a little more cleanly you let him stay on his feet too long but the renfro a walk lawn retro freshman who is becoming a machine just always seems open as great feeling for routes and space cant blame austin for the takedown we got justice had a heck of a game he s gotten a lot of help nice move <person player="deshaun watson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">watson</person> take it out near the 17 yard line 40 seconds to go in the half youve got just lined up over j <person player="jay guillermo" race="UNK" position="OL">guillermo</person> just a good quick move gets right by<person player="tyrone crowder" race="UNK" position="G">tyrone crowder</person>one of the new guys up front he s a little bit of struggles learning the speed of the game big powerful man but god says slips right by in there zach <person player="zac brooks" race="UNK" position="RB">brooks</person> the running back i think you got to think about a timeout here if your clemson watch this block at 33 now youve shot third down watch this box dont you dont want to blow this and now youve got to hold it for the defense change it s a lot of clock this is two or three plays theyre losing or not using that timeout once again inside the stem the clock will stop as they move the chains 14 seconds uconn the second quarter clock well you still have a timeout so you can run it on this series it down good so you clock it there and because you lost that time youre down to maybe two plays i think you can maybe throw a fade for sure if you dont have no they killed the clock on first down could you use that time out before you still have with your clemson you still have the time out so you can do a running play but yet to be careful the guy get bounced around and too much time runs off we can do with a timeout but be shot but we dont see two quick rows in a row like bunch of receivers are bunched on the right <person player="deshaun watson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">watson</person> looks that way and then throws a post for pass it got some pressure from rook cheng on and now youre sitting here at third and goal we take a look at jeff scott the cooffensive coordinator wide receiver coach luckily i think for clemson that was incomplete because i think youre down to the two and now you have time for two plays so third down fourth down and i think it s this point youre probably going to kick the field goal if you dont convert here if your clemson to get ahead greased with three scores for sure texas perfect throw and a nice route by the legged it second touchdown catch of the day beat<person player="corey griffin" race="UNK" position="DB">corey griffin</person>to self for safety that s a tough matchup for a 62 state five rushers come offensive line at least picking it up not doing the greatest jump walks it has to fall back a little bit but that that just looked easy right now remember a safety demonstartion back up for he griffin in there struggling to beg his sister antastic working receiving gigantic clemson gets the lake touchdown to go up 33 to 10 and the tigers looking like this bickering female country week 5 edition of monday night football at 8:15 eastern on espn lay beyond bella steelers against philip rivers in the chargers coverage starts monday night countdown to 6 oclock on a yes also streaming live on watch espn mike tirico john weekly fantastic job on monday night football well they told us they needed to find ways to get leggett more involved to touchdowns to the first dances that were involved jeff yes under the next item and let s see how many of start to see some depth i would assume for clemson rolling and they always do play a lot of guys defensively they always play a lot of customers has been unfortunately for paul johnson he doesnt have a lot of guys especially into fall offensive backfield he can roll in four seconds on the clock so theyll squibbitt such as the georgia tech player and they say in one second when off the clock before you down you fall johnson the thing you have to sell at halftime weve gotten one turnover what if we get two in the second half what if we get three youre going to have to sell something to the seam to keep them focused and i dont like the smirk on your face right now if youve got to try it s all gorgeou tech youre talking to a bunch of smart kids and you go in and tell them hey look let s pretend it if nothing nothing if the have ifs forces anything it is a lesson of life of how to stand up against new togs yeah yeah yeah go stella let s go fair where theyre buying it well paul that s what i hear if youre small johnson you got to sell something and coaches are really good at that i think killed a jerry punch coach is part of the rain and everything theyre dealing with your offense played pretty well pleased you most about the play of your offense in the first half well weve just been businesslike you know were taking care of the ball you know were running the ball effect we cant run out of the gate with a great long run theyre on third down were throwing ejecting the ball very weapons whether outside of the one big plays hut touchdown on our defense we played very sound that s what you got to do against these guys you got to maximize your opportunities and win that field position bottle doubledigit leads against louisville and notre dame when you let them back in the football game how concerned are you about that happening in the second half well im just worried about you know trying to beat georgia tech for us you know it s i say it all sound nothing less than board and scored half down we got it we got it zero zero game that s got to be our mentality and that s where we got to grow up at the team you know weve got to put people away when we have the opportunity to do that it aint okay thanks jerry thank you deb oh when we come back to studio well bring you up to date on everything at halftime in college football after these messages you oh it is really pc on you welcome back to slums let s take a look at our hats on double checks brought to you by state farm in its 3310 after two quarters the only big play georgia tech had in the entire first half that long 50yard pass but other than that their offense has done nothing their defense has done nothing not a good combination oh theyre going to need some turnovers or something happen in the big game for them to get back in to it but for clemson what s been really impressive number one defense in the country last year they returned one starter from that group a bunch of guys who played a lot as we take a look at our ap ap strong performance after the stick will show you how how well they have played on the defensive line let s take a look now at the at&amp;t strong performance and<person player="carlos watkins" race="nonwhite" position="DT">carlos watkins</person>into the middle of the defensive line that has to defeat the block and then be able to come off and be athletic enough to make a play on the ball <person player="carlos watkins" race="nonwhite" position="DT">watkins</person> of course made to stop on the twopoint conversion against notre dame that won the game and then<person player="scott pagano" race="UNK" position="DT">scott pagano</person>does an excellent job getting outside his lock it s the first bit on the lead fullback and then whatever georgia tech decides am the path you mentioned how good theyre just a comment having to run for his life than they did try to grow quarterback keeper and another negative play<person player="dorian odaniel" race="nonwhite" position="LB">dorian odaniel</person>a sophomore just wouldnt well let him go and well go to cassidy hubbard google studio im sorry kerry punch at the sidelines excuse me donna closed baby bop job guys paul johnson said going into halftime he said and i quote we are a selfdestructing mess when he came out again we did not run a play correctly in our first three theory we just got to run correctly well have a shot well doc get the heck away to describe it in the first play of the second half is just more the same so does the gate man on the second play of the happened theyve got to burn the time out that s about as bad as it gets a bunch of new guys in the backfield there s so much misdirection there s so many things that you have to know paul is not happy yeah laying into a senior paul schoo excuse me patrick s cove the transfer from stanford at this point im not sure what things go to stock it fades way to the point that yelling guys he s got to get him motivated but cup coaching even though theyre down 23 <person player="gary brown" race="UNK" position="OL">gary</person> what do you think he s he s telling us good you know when he came out bike and he looked at me and he just seemed so frustrating but i cant explain it off he said you know were lining up were not blocking correctly were not were not executing and this offense we run is all about execution and misdirection an option he said were just not running a correct place but ive never seen this before and i dont know how to explain it he said hopefully we can run some correct plays when we got to get lined up correctly and obviously we saw right there that wasnt the case and jerry it s a tremendous explanation because this offense is all about execution more so than any other offense or in his high beam and yet i mean a high speed marshall swarmed under youve got to give credit to this plumpton defense they have been up to the acceptable employ they have been up to every challenge they face and that one play which was watching the safety he played brilliantly today was what recommendable said was fun about coming in monday after notre dame you come in with a win a huge win and there were so many things picked correct because they were really just mental breakdowns in the second era climb back the level of the pro game if it s always these goes hard after a win in a wall and coach is just the logs tough to collapse crowd really into it like ive only gets minimal yardage <person player="ben boulware" race="UNK" position="LB">boulware</person> and <person player="scott pagano" race="UNK" position="DT">pagano</person> were in on the tackle again there was such a big deal made of<person player="carlos watkins" race="nonwhite" position="DT">carlos watkins</person>play last week against notre dame and rightfully so but because it was a point after he didnt get credit for attacking it s no different except that s yeah well well take a look at the first half of the sean <person player="deshaun watson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">watson</person> this time in the triple option he could hand it off throw it or run it he went to throwing that the coverage was there he s such a good hitting runner that he was able to pick up nine and his accuracy he gets going in you noticed an earlier mic this has the ability to put touch on the ball exact yura see his timing a couple throws he threw in the dirt because guys werent open there were so many people around this data sensation for a fact he is just a wonderful talent who calming nice are the coaches one of the first things they said he gets every inch that he possibly so long it s on last year we did the georgia tech game where unfortunately<person player="deshaun watson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">deshaun watson</person>was hurt in that first quarter the film ended up in a pretty nice game he was a true freshman that you mentioned zack <person player="zac brooks" race="UNK" position="RB">brooks</person> went down before the season last year had to <person player="step durham" race="nonwhite" position="DB">step</person> up and has a ton of confidence now over 100 yards which will go hundred yards over 100 yards against notre dame <person player="deshaun watson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">watson</person> changing the play so gulman could pick up the blitzer very heady call by the quarterback made sure gulman was on his left because he saw it coming gulman was right there got the block ron deke not able to go up and make a play last week there was an interception they felt like he could have made a better play on the ball but that was terrific coverage by vijay white deke with the longer arm sixfootfour able to go over <person player="bj goodson" race="UNK" position="LB">bj</person> white at terrific position im not blitz coming they get there but <person player="deshaun watson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">watson</person> gets away and now he s buried caught by tyler mccourt as the blitz came from sophomore<person player="lawrence austin" race="UNK" position="DB">lawrence austin</person>and he blew right by the quarterback this is just an excellent job by <person player="deshaun watson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">watson</person> unblocked guy coleman and the right guard<person player="tyrone crowder" race="UNK" position="G">tyrone crowder</person>went to block the same guy miscommunication there in the middle good follow through by micarta sort of student tease doll is on the kick <person player="jamal

college football saturday dont miss any of the action while youre on the go you can stream any game live download the watch espn app or go to watch the espncom you have to run errands on a saturday afternoon you need to have a conversation did you significant diploid gets not much for market and alan s 220 pounds jr it s good to point out again how many injuries they have had to what they refer to as their a back those are the guys on the wing the guys they kept on an outside feeder brothers sweet and the big plays theyve walked devon hey back and that s why there is confusion a bunch of young guys who havent had to do much that felt like it needed to be a bigger run there<person player="marcus allen" race="UNK" position="FB">marcus allen</person>looks like he had a good head of steam and got caught up with his feet right at the line of scrimmage weve only seen the one long throw the link here third and five maybe this is somewhere where you try to sneak one of those a box out and see if the safety for clemson no safety feet for clemson now everybody within five yards behind the screen 11 got within five yards and they run the dive fly you know if im a georgia tech fan and last year was a magical year and you cant take away what they did last year but this would be a little frustrating for me to say you know were at a major university that has won a national championship and that s the office were running on 3rd down down by 23 it s got to be a little frustrating youre going to be in this position and the offense that paul johnson sixtwo and runs just doesnt give you the opportunity i mean that s a fullback dive on 3rd and 5 down 23 see where if your pet bad georgia tech is going to say that it hit scott the return man but it did not then it s a kick of 36 check in with dr punch guys it s now time for the bright side brought to you by karma after last saturday night s big win over another damian was blue oclock in the morning when clemson offensive line coach bobby caldwell left the office and headed home on his way home he stopped at a convenience store the bike he saw two stranded notre dame fans who were soaking wet from walking in the rain they told him that they had missed the shuttle on the way back to their hotel some 10 miles away and he actually needed a ride home call well said youre not going to walk in the rain hop in my truck i will take you home they thought it was at the nice man wearing a swimsuit half what a google later they realized he was one of the premier offensive line coach into the country folks remember coaches are supposed to be leaders mentors and role models bobby caldwell is all that and more jerry it s a wonderful story and well a job he has done as a coach not just a human being but as they coaches gulman fronted straight forward with this offensive line that today has no returning starters in it because why am <person player="ryan norton" race="UNK" position="OL">norton</person> their center whose is coming back is injured so they have five guys did not start a year ago and weve got a georgia tech injury somebody got drilled on my last paw and that s cory griffin he was laid out on the field and theyve already lost georgia tech s already lost them on smith you he did move his leg we want to report that griffin did just pick his leg up so that leg was flat he did just pick it up and moving his leg well take a break come back check on his injury right after this i see lapierre both college football on abc brought to you by gmc we are professional grade as i was saying that is the bob <person player="christian campbell" race="UNK" position="QB">campbell</person> theology museum has more than 10,000 items rocks minerals fossils carvings gemstones and artifacts and i took geology from the gentleman named dr kolecki recalled he was from hungary and he called the course locked and meaningful we stayed his blocks and minerals basement is howard s rock a rock or a mineral i wonder i believe it s raw i believe it is food found in the arizona desert by the way and given to frank howard as the gift initially he didnt want it doing it at the californian ill correct you it came from death valley in california ah there s howard s office before the doorstop and there is griffin it was a right arm or shoulder injury he wasnt moving for a while i think maybe in a great deal of pain but they were working on his right arm good clean tackle but came in and goldman gets better of what s coming <person player="deshaun watson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">watson</person> hangs in there and it s intercepted picked off by the linebacker brian mitchell 13 yard return the second turnover for georgia tech i said brian to <person player="grant aasen" race="UNK" position="P">grant</person> mitchell mitchell the young man who has a nice block on that big hunk earlier in the game drops out and what blossom looking to his left comes never saw him come out of that drop he stayed to his left never surveyed the field mitchell does a wonderful job reading the quarterback eyes and going right underneath is it that that linebacker dropping off of the side youre not looking is usually the hardest for a quarterback to see thomas often thought nothing worked outside during a no daniel number six we backed up<person player="travis blanks" race="UNK" position="LB">travis blanks</person>that that outside linebacker spot has had a couple of big plays oh daniel a terrific athlete who got a bunch of run in this year s last year s game against georgia tech because of some injuries theyre reading this so well it s almost like the guys in orange to take the beat that bitch i mean this is this has really not been a good day for georgia tech on the edge clemson clearly not just athletically better but theyve been coached off this is a really good group menticles has on the field and the defensive coaches did a remarkable job getting ready for this game they are reading this team they are able to get outside this option attack and justice jumping dominance again a little slow to get out and this is a numbers game on defense the offense is trying to get the numbers advantage to one side or another and clemson is not let them do it well theyre able to play all oneonone on the outside so they have nine guys committed to the line of scrimmage right now jump in thomas does not look 100% healthy he s been early we saw a little banged up it looks like maybe his left leg but he does not look like himself on the field right now under pressure didnt have a chance for salmon supporting<person player="kevin dodd" race="UNK" position="DE">kevin dodd</person>now with four and a half sacks on the year this is a kid who they said had very few reps before this year because of his leg behind outstanding players but brent venable said he stayed engaged he never got down never sulk just kept his head to the game and as<person player="justin thomas" race="UNK" position="QB">justin thomas</person>after that terrific sack by dodge limped off an offensive lineman number 75 that s aaron joe the starting right tackle grabbing his left arm so things going from bad to worse weve already mentioned georgia tech has lost seven players from the running back position since last spring now theyve got a quarterback who looks like he s not 100% an offensive lineman how about this dad ed 33 rushes for georgia tech eight have been for long eight of 33 the edge is the parental perimeter run game getting outside the office of tackle on the option is essential and i just dont i dont remember one play where they got the edge today where there wasnt two people from clemson standing there and now unfortunately for paul johnson is what has been the best quarterback he s had in his time here at georgia tech not looking 100% you feel bad for these young men they came into the season after such a great year thomas was the mvp of the orange bowl injury after injury after injury and now things starting to go even more sideways another hi short kicks in the 30yard line and clemson takes over from there only a 30yard booth let s go to cassidy i might get a weekly reminder just how good leonard fournette is tell south carolina dean goodbye 87yard touchdown which puts them over 1,000 yards rushing in just four and a half games often 58 yards so far in this game for four that mike eddie nasty this kid is just an absolute beast he s bigger than everybody know better than everybody sallman breaks the tackle push alexa near midfield this guys can really run i know that they had something to take the coaches wanting his pads down etcetera but he runs with a purpose he s a big guy really good vision he feeds the whole really well and good topend speed buddy it s the guy who could carry a 3040 times if you had to you dont need to in this offense but averaging 10 yards a carry will work before this carry at 119 yards on 12 carry caught us in the back yard is going to lose a few on this one and it s gorgeous x1 and more quarters i want to offend them with the chyron georgia tech doing there clemson impersonation on game or thing they had on the edge to block this is such a young georgia tech team on both sides of the ball <person player="deshaun watson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">watson</person> s so calm watch her clean and breaking away is kane beyond kane <person player="deshaun watson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">watson</person> is just so cool yeah this play takes a long time to develop pain a former high school quarterback just figuring this out terrific block on the outside and let s be miss hackel by simmons let s see you made that tackle look like go down clemson was another burst and they take goldman out in zach <person player="zac brooks" race="UNK" position="RB">brooks</person> it will run 35 for a touchdown how many weapons be me well if you want to go play for the national championship you may need them all well theyve got them you know crazy as it sounds a startling to see weve seen ohio state s wife this year yep <person player="clinton lynch" race="UNK" position="RB">clinton</person> to play nose for nose with a hostage from what weve seen i think clumsiness better quarterback i think they have a more diverse explosive offense google on state maybe a little better defensively right now but this is becoming a very good group for clemson you look at this schedule through the acc for two states potentially and i think they can beat everybody else on the rest 50 houses starvation about me a long way to go but i think theyre staring undefeated in the face this guy s in shape he may be tested next 40 he thought when <person player="chad smith" race="UNK" position="LB">chad</person> <person player="maverick morris" race="UNK" position="G">morris</person> left as the offensive coordinator he catches brave but unfortunate unfortunately john has done a nice job of training his replacement and one s been able to promote from within and not miss the beat offensively of course helps to have the <person player="shawn davis" race="UNK" position="K">shawn</person> <person player="shaq lawson" race="nonwhite" position="DE">lawson</person> at quarterback marshall on the return for georgia tech nothing going right to the jacket tonight on abc saturday night football presented by wells fargo number 12 florida state prostate rival miami 8:00 eastern on abc some those have won the last five against miami and this is setting up what could be afforded state ladies tonight and unbeaten meeting between clemson and florida state and the seminoles have had the tigers number last year just a gutwrenching law at florida state for clemson we got the ball back inside and have fun with it<person player="justin thomas" race="UNK" position="QB">justin thomas</person>gonna keeper and he just cant actually know where to go which team made the tackle jerry punch with an injury update yeah the walking wounded continue for georgia tech big right tackle aaron joe second the locker room with the shoulder we are told he has done for the day and defensively<person player="corey griffin" race="UNK" position="DB">corey griffin</person>the song safety came to the south on deprecating at helmet the helmet hit have a thorough evaluation they have pulled his helmet from him he will not be back this afternoon it goes from bad to worse than the done second antennas they overload the left side with motion pants underneath the tune and he will make the catch statement for darkening he would read <person player="cordrea tankersley" race="UNK" position="CB">tankersley</person> button on the tatters want you to resort and there you see the arm of<person player="justin thomas" race="UNK" position="QB">justin thomas</person>we called last year when he had aaron lawlor and deandre melters two wide receivers who were then drafted into the nfl he really can bro it he s got a good arm him he needs to buy finish those you know pretty short to be able to see but if he can get some space he can throw it this is not what their base offense was it does have a really nice on it can be very accurate look russell <person player="casey wilson" race="UNK" position="LS">wilson</person> 510 11 well look at this beep you know that<person player="dorian odaniel" race="nonwhite" position="LB">dorian odaniel</person>last year as a freshman had to <person player="step durham" race="nonwhite" position="DB">step</person> up and play with the player of the game for clemson but this is the second time the big run to pitch to that side and <person player="dorian odaniel" race="nonwhite" position="LB">odaniel</person> standing there ready to take it i mean he s thomas almost pitches it if he does yeah number six and making it know a lot of good answers for breakfast today because of ej <person player="dj reader" race="UNK" position="DT">reader</person> we mentioned the good diba technical who s away from the team taking a break for personal reasons that can we defend inside can we end theyre not going to get bored calling the outside they have it s an incomplete and let s go back to how hard it is to defend this often it is this offense is run by teams that are undersized but use this offense to equalize everything youve got to be so good everybody every single play to stop this off well we saw on the touchdown to the running back the safety makes it one <person player="adam choice" race="UNK" position="RB">choice</person> one wrong <person player="adam choice" race="UNK" position="RB">choice</person> thinking he s supposed to come up and defend the run they run right by you unfortunately for georgia tech theyre just theyre out of guys that can get speed on the edge and out back if you cant get the option with speed and around guys like oh daniel and just dont have the chain mostly comes on the blitz underneath them complete caught by lands davis<person player="tj green" race="UNK" position="S">tj green</person>with the tackle in the last two times theyve thrown theyve actually had receivers open and he unfortunately<person player="justin thomas" race="UNK" position="QB">justin thomas</person>is still he s just not healthy something happened to early in the game he looked uncomfortable medically evaluated and he just doesnt look like 100% so they just get whacked too this one is wide who got it out doing everything he can what what i would be concerned about if i were georgia tech at this point and if he just has its weak dankel if you greet a fit it s rare that youre going to injure it further so i dont know that theyre risking his health necessarily pud at some point maybe youve got to think about getting<person player="matthew jordan" race="UNK" position="QB">matthew jordan</person>now youre back up with him by early out to start to get some reps you may meet him later in the season well it certainly influences his ability to run he has lost five yards you tried to hang on to the back and there is the base play for the option offense it has to give to something if they cover the dive play if they stop that it s supposed to open up the outside but because of the interest your lack of speed you cant do that either if you cant run inside you cant run outside what do you have left you dont go to any shotgun for the quarterback so he s got to take every snap under center you are that is if youre going to run this triple option beer type of speed option it has its limitations and were seeing it right now look at this all the pressure they had tried to set up a screen but it was a jailbreak chasing thomas then <person player="ben boulware" race="UNK" position="LB">boulware</person> numbers hand was out there trying to set up a screen pressure brought both linebackers come before there s a lot of long arms you know you hear about hoses long enough in recruiting we run a recruit long guy that means they have long arms dont think about how tall a guy is is does he have long arms and every guy it seems like for clemson seems to have wings been able to put them up and there s six five free safety items you can combine them sit for long arms this is just a physically impressive looking group im only a 25yard let s take a look at the remaining schedule for clemson i think theyre better than boston college s are better than miami the better than nc state i have not seen florida state they dont look like that theyve been the last couple of years i think defensively porter state has some real issues in their secondary you cant have that against clemson theyre better than syracuse better than wake forest and this year better than south carolina this is a schedule especially with the next next year four games i think theyre just better than repeat this miami will be competitive but this is the key figures are going to start getting in this game youre going to start getting more development of your second string offense number 70 a 10yard penalty first there that s left guard eric mcclain jerry punch pointed out in our production meeting last night clemson has always had problems at nc state and that s you know that can be viewed as a stumbling block but when you look at that schedule you say if you can overcome the jinx that theyve that against florida state youre looking at an undefeated season and if theyre undefeated there s no way in the world theyre not in the convoy yeah we actually flew to dallas this week the college football playoff it was fall in the endzone scramble touchdown the sun comes out and georgia tech gets another break the third turnover in this ball game look like it was a decent snap the backup would like mm ellie<person player="justin falcinelli" race="UNK" position="OL">justin falcinelli</person>the backup in it it was a little hot it was thrown hard but it looked like the <person player="shawn davis" race="UNK" position="K">shawn</person> <person player="deshaun watson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">watson</person> just missed that and then the scramble for the ball ends up in a white white jersey but georgia tech lines up for the point after to make it 42:17 and they not declared so but the only thing georgia tech has been able to do is capitalize on a couple of big plays they certainly have not been able to move the ball consistently against clemson nor have they been able to stop the consistent after tonight s pac12 showdown on espn stick around for sportscenter and i catch a full recap of the day in college football as well as highlights from baseball postseason sportscenter at night kicking off with cal when we call and on espn and streaming live on watch espn understood the cow had too deep to hang with you too hot from what i see their golf starting to creep up as a nfl potential high draft pick quarterback im not sure the pac12 sending anybody the playoff this year though i think that doesnt look like it i think that s going to end up being a two loss champion theyre not sure heating their own yeah and the good news for clemson with the way theyre starting to gel they get out of here with a win which looks like they are in total control but you mentioned it if bumps and went undefeated won the agency theyd be in we went to dallas this week and went through a mock playoff selection and were in the process and you know after learning that i can guarantee if you read your conference of your power five there s no way to committee people it turn goes up to 25 yard line by <person player="rayray mccloud" race="UNK" position="WR">rayray</person> macleod and the way that they do when we start looking at it you start laying out we lay out schedules for teams you can you compare them week to week right there s just no way youd lay out lumps in is be that they beat a top10 notre dame team they will beat a top 15 at the time for tuesday team the floor today continues prevent then they would have gone and played a championship game they get credit for conference championships and then undefeated there s just no way <person player="clinton lynch" race="UNK" position="RB">clinton</person> s not playing for at all or at least get the telephone back to the ground game weimar search im sorry cj jacobson mr clemson and even city had 15 carries coming in so that s the third running back debuts they started with gulman got <person player="zac brooks" race="UNK" position="RB">brooks</person> in there now trying to get <person player="cj davidson" race="UNK" position="RB">davidson</person> some reps he had been the backup another carry off right tackle off near the finish line as you think there was any chance that<person player="deshaun watson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">deshaun watson</person>is actually reading that zone read at this point as one would hope now i have a hard time believing that that s not just a fake that read down the line i just dont know that theyre going to be giving courses got that see <person player="cj fuller" race="UNK" position="RB">fuller</person> patch on his jersey there that was retired number that we called <person player="cj fuller" race="UNK" position="RB">fuller</person> and said can i wear it and then dad though sweetie said sure but let s put a patch on there one of the greatest players in our history was italy her honor him that he let you wear your high school number even though it was retired well he s doing in proud isnt it yes here end of the quarter clemson 42:17 over you know this presentation of college football from death valley will continue after this this susan susan who s in army im in im in army im and i cant be sure im a

position="DB">milton</person> is going to have a longterm injury but this is becoming ridiculous for georgia tech to a point where we start to wonder how theyre going to hold it together down the stretch really running out of veteran guys who can play they were already playing 13 freshmen were sungan made the tackle on that last play for i cant imagine that the <person player="shawn davis" race="UNK" position="K">shawn</person> <person player="deshaun watson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">watson</person> is clemson is able to score on this possession that he s going to play much more this not a blowout were not completely in the clear here so understandable that he s in but i dont remember the last time they called his number running that which seems like a wise <person player="adam choice" race="UNK" position="RB">choice</person> im a clown well i would advance this theory if theyre not in the clear right now theyre not going to be youre still early in the fourth quarter and remember this the team against clemson against louisville and notre dame that took doubledigit leads into the fly order and nearly gave it back in both places took a miracle stop on a second down conversion or receive a twopoint conversion to not force overtime against notre dame flanker screen <person player="trevion thompson" race="UNK" position="WR">thompson</person> tripped up shy the first down at the 25yard line<person player="dj white" race="UNK" position="DB">dj white</person>saved the day and clemson bull this send on the field goal team and theyre sending out eamonn lake if the young man who was suspended for the first three games of the season for being arrested for dwi and drug possession he lost his job to huebel but they said lake if out who was a starter last year big moment for him trying to get back in the good graces an exception hector not that worried clomp sanic speed and then displease the 3:17 welcome back want some let s take a look at our pacific life gainers summary georgia tech only 142 yards in total offense they have been dominated by the clemson tigers the clemson has racked up almost pulling a half second the studio with cassidy hubbard all right like charlie strong got a big win today cookbooks jones do the same job job in with the oneyard run game tied at 24 in the third got a close one enough though like that thank you very very big game for the home cook yeah unfortunately for georgia nick jump here he s broken his leg terrific season coming to an end georgia has seen that happen at the running back position recently countess because got the defensive end rogers just wouldnt let them get outside and still help arrive a lot of clean jerseys on this defense for clemson they just put in all the backup let s watch brent venables coach with some of these younger guys jurgen comes in richard gere again well they still got em kirsten is a 65 pre safety i think it s still one around with all those tackles for loss but theyre getting a bunch of orange jerseys theyre a good play here this is really good time for fun for developing death we like died and set up near the 40 yard line that will be a first down for the jacket and of course georgia tech and clemson are on two opposite divisions in this conference but this is a protected rivalry game clemson and georgia tech play every year so for the tigers this is an opportunity to get some of those back in and third string linemen and linebackers in to learn how to play against this type of offense for georgia tech because theyre going to see the next year up in atlanta he s down in italy if it is we put down is actually correctly central geography would have pissed one of the coop office weve actually been able to get outside but it does them no good mckenzie alexander who was dylan there with a great tackle this kid is really good and he knows he s really good terrific practice habits has always been an incredibly good worker on balance long arms weve talked about the length of these players this guy is the terrific corner but davos sweeney last week effort he shut down will <person player="cj fuller" race="UNK" position="RB">fuller</person> i mean completely shut down the explosive christian of notre dame sweeney did ask him to tone down the talk a little bit they only have 63 yards rushing something you saw the graphic the last time it happened was against miami when miami was great on defense testcomplete the land with lands davis davis long see when thomas had time he could grow up yes he can we saw them last year and thomas to me was of all just as the player he was the most exciting player i thought i saw all last season in the games that we covered but here s the guy gimpy on his left ankle theyre down to 3rd and 4th string running backs they lost two receivers for the nfl draft <person player="micheal summers" race="UNK" position="WR">summers</person> was hurt for two games cost nothing chillin this is just remarkable to watch and again it was so daniel this kid has been everywhere he s very athletic they claim that he s under a four five second forty 40 yard dash for contact four or five forty is what you look for for running backs and wide receivers and here s a 230 pound linebacker just a sophomore these plates just he s been in oh i havent seen him out of position on the edge play yet that has got him and curse alexander both defensive end from a sentimental man wide open a threat to ricki june and hell walk in that the second time the playaction is held the entire secondary first time it went 450 the time of those 446 j ron first was the safety when they got <person player="clinton lynch" race="UNK" position="RB">clinton</person> when will detect on<person player="clinton lynch" race="UNK" position="RB">clinton lynch</person>brilliant look to me like first and the corner to that side alexander got caught up and what werent sir he was supposed to go long to coverage you and if there is a weakness on this defense in the secondary they have some loan coverages there are some times where they let guys run free happen against notre dame and cj prosise had that long catching touchdown run on the sideline there s plenty for them between us you yes pn s college football on abc brought to you by mesa premier partner of the heisman trophy and pacific life for life insurance annuities and investments choose pacific life of power to help you succeed this is a graveyard to death family when they beat a ranked team on the road need a new <person player="daniel stone" race="UNK" position="T">stone</person> near the interest of the practice vehicle last time was the orange bowl win over ohio state theyre going to keep having to get stones that folks built the way they are starting to build this program well there s the graveyard you dont mind see filling up dabo i think was thinking potentially onside kick so he wanted to talk to his return to you but let s go back to the blown coverage j run curse running over there mackenzie clearly allowing the receiver jun to go by him and watch curse just he just saw ghost and that was the vigna <person player="trent sellers" race="UNK" position="DL">trent</person> venable says we had to clean up it was fourth quarter we had a couple of blown coverages that really cost us against notre dame and here s venables going through making sure they obviously curse and alexander playing to different defenses there so need to figure out some things to clean up but youve got a lot of work a lot to work with to clean it up two passes went from 96 yards the other 52 plays they got a total of 120 that s what this offense can do but their defense is given up 43 and everyone 10 guys up for clemson one guy at the 30 nobody deep expecting an onside kick here get that yesterday goes all the way inside the five and now down to the three our tabas scott didnt really know what to do with it pounds let s get back to fun guys this past summer davos sweeney s dad ervil was battling cancer but he kept telling dad though he was very excited about this year and especially the notre dame game unfortunately your dad passed away on august 8 at the funeral davo was as able you like a thumbprint when your dad to put on the necklace to remember him by he said sure he had forgotten all about his last body but his only way to the office his wife kathleen said dabo gets what just arrived in the mail your dad s thumbprint so at the end of the notre game game last week when debo was down on both knees and looking up with a sky he said not only was he given thanks he was thinking about the spirit of his dad the spirit that helped him beat notre dame in the spirit that will make this a very special season the potter will always remember that moment from you know that great storage area and youve now able to start working on some death nick schussler a deceptive runner not quite as explosive as <person player="deshaun watson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">watson</person> but he was the guy who got all the spring reps when they went through spring practice all the first team reps when<person player="deshaun watson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">deshaun watson</person>was rehabbing the left knee injury that he had surgery on so this is a guy who s had a lot of reps with this group the offensive line the receivers starting to get some backups good work here im safe down here police comin yeah youre up youre up 19 youre feeling okay but youre not feeling like you want if you were a 25 3touchdowns a mistake here could become 2 and without locking in there just the handoff game begin what a terrific day by him another nice day at the office 265 pass and when you 16 on the ground it s hard to believe that this guy is just his second football season removed from high school yeah just has so much command is it s horrific athlete a pow starting to become a polished quarterback that s a little wait to go there this guy s just did his 20th year so it s got a long way to go juice blur this is six three junior <person player="trevion thompson" race="UNK" position="WR">thompson</person> has to burn down under the timeout or exactly 30 second time you can catch a doubleheader tonight on espn at seven oclock college football primetime presented by hilton as arkansas closing at number eight alabama the tides back in and arent they then 10 a huge pac12 battle unbeaten space off number 23 cal number 5 you saw both games on the spms watch espn i guess it s the times that we live in alabama loses the game everybody write them all i guess were not used to alabama losing yeah it really was shocking how dominant they were especially at the line of scrimmage against georgia were deep burning up a little bit on <person player="mark fields" race="UNK" position="CB">mark</person> richter who as were on a terrific program runs it well but if youre a bulldog fan youre threatened a little tired of not being able to compete with the elite in your own league and it is starting to feel like theyre not quite at that elite level especially after what they with left without a noreaster good for the throw from his own end zone ears it out and beyond pain when up and got it at 54 36 nice girl by fueler fewer than a better chance and a perfect call right because youve got third down you dont want to do anything dangerous throw this to the boundary the worst thing that you hope would happen with a guy obtains ability inside the even though he s a true freshman is an incomplete pass the coverage is pretty good by white but this is the young guy gain they think has a tremendous upside they always had that color receiver on the outside he could go up and get it this guy s a quarterback in high school and a really nice throw by seussville he put that put that right where his didnt i like the call by tony elliott cj white never saw the ball playing the krail technique reached up and tried to knock it away at the end but could he do it we jay puller the redshirt freshman getting a chance to run if they dont score what are the chances clem s gets burnout this block the way theyve been dominated i mean you know theyre already just cross midfield and theyre picking up chunks four five but this is an offensive line now youre starting to get some some offensive line getting some of your depth worked on and this is really nice controlled by tony elliott 20 right there in the middle just pulled off they knew they got this on <person player="deshaun watson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">watson</person> beat he cooked some good hits last week he had a great game running the ball but they knew after last exchange that they couldnt run <person player="deshaun watson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">watson</person> all season long as much as they had against notre dame they hadnt really want that jeff s got the cooffensive coordinator if they realized that was just too many runs over the course of the season so when they got ahead today they didnt call anymore <person player="deshaun watson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">watson</person> runs and that s a little different than what we saw had <person player="maverick morris" race="UNK" position="G">morris</person> a lot of times would leave that quarterback run in but it s like a nice adjustment today by clemson and now able to get some of these younger dolphins to run and rolling through in a group that is starting to cook if you look at how this offensive line played against notre dame last week and notre dame it can be really chaotic up front they gained a lot of confidence wyatt comes in at quarterback he is a dynamic runner he s got enough for a first down checking with cassidy hovers cassidy mike you guys are talking about that georgia loss alabama last week the bulldogs on upset alert again <person player="josh selembo" race="UNK" position="DB">josh</person> dobbs third td pass of the day 28 unanswered points for the vols 31 24 to start the force density thank you do those uniforms say to you no they go they say let s sell some gear new offensive line they just did an entire change they rotated a couple of guys in but all the young guys now come in and look how clean those jerseys are order back kieffer again and bryant gets stuck at the line of scrimmage to be able to get reps for your second string offensive line in a situation where the defense knows youre going to run it there s no youre not going to try much except maybe a drop back fast like we saw what you see right there erick mcclain the left guard coming out so we have all young guys that jake brew morgan one of the true freshman that they got this year on the offensive line one of the top recruits in the nation of course we told the story of robby caldwell last week we open two line coach giving some rides to stranded notre dame fans after the game but he s got to be awfully happy with how a group that was like all informations the weakness of this team with the offensive line coming into the season has to be really happy with how they perform you know what a feelgood story that was what a nice man he was to do that would he draw the line in south carolina well they got the win against south carolina last year so maybe not but this is this is truly an impressive program that davo sweeney remember took over 2008 his first game he was named head coach on monday his first game was against georgia tech which was a loss that seems like such a long time ago and yes it does he has really made this program his own the hiring of brent venables the guy there to his left with big smile in his face was just a really good change that sweetie he knew he needed a federal defense in no time vote for the bomb again out of bound <person player="trevion thompson" race="UNK" position="WR">thompson</person> theyre going to say he was denied go i dont think so yeah caribbean <person player="trevion thompson" race="UNK" position="WR">thompson</person> again it s you slit to the outside gotta catch that lump it was close it was close that that left foot was down but it looks to me like the left foot the left foot as it comes it s off the ground the four secures are out of bounds so upon review be shocked if they do not overturn the coal in the theater they will take a look this will tell you who wins when we come back well the place stood it was not confirmed and as we went back and looked frame by frame this was much closer than we originally thought and it s this frame right there where it looks like the balls in his hands it not sure if he has control but you can see the foot still down and because it has to be indisputable video evidence it is a little question there whether he had it so because the call on the field was catch you have to keep it i dont think that was a catch that s not good enough that one frame there left you believe it maybe he did catch it too it has a stance yes the call on the field is all accounts ej <person player="cj fuller" race="UNK" position="RB">fuller</person> and i need to get to the outside viktor alexander made the tackle if they call it incomplete if they cant overturn it if they call it complete they can open and i get a lot of credit to the replay booth that s what theyre supposed to do if not completely indisputable that it was incomplete you have to let it stand as called and i go back to the field officials there have four frame oh sometimes i mean that was literally one half of frame true where did he catch it or not unbelievable how well they do in real time the drive has gone 88 yards so far for once jesus and here s where we were talking about the college football playoff we were a bunch of colleagues from espn we went to dallas this week and went through a mock voting of the 2011 season that s what we looked at year that clemson had won the acc championship the the amount of points that clemson wins by right here wont be a factor theyve had control of this game so when they go to study if you dont have to blow people out by 30 40 points as long as youre in control of the game and they could go back and look that they cant roll it all the way through that s the credit you get as they look at the season and break it down that s where i think that that s part of it is a flaw if you can honestly look at the score and somebody s running it up again you can dismiss that right you dont have to have a rule or were not know theyre this way no there s not there s no rule it s that what they talk about is that was a 17point win where they were in control and if they wanted to and if im saying obviously this is 19 points this is a 19 point win even if they dont score here but at any time that could have been 40 if they really study the game you know that 19 is not really 19 points this game wasnt that competitive and the the committee does talk about that in a game that game scenario when theyre looking at the top four especially for some goals people will try to run and theyll stop them and people will say well why did you try to score well they you run a plane rather than kick a field goal because that s automatic and youre not running up this got a timeout only 21 seconds left here at clemson now it s time to take a look at today s good hands play brought to you by allstate well how about the hands of the <person player="shawn davis" race="UNK" position="K">shawn</person> <person player="deshaun watson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">watson</person> just accurate excellent touch on the ball and he twice found<person player="jordan leggett" race="UNK" position="TE">jordan leggett</person>who that s an awfully big guy who makes it look easy in space but<person player="deshaun watson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">deshaun watson</person>with terrific handeye coordination he seems that great touch on every throw just the really emerging star jordan on the carry i feel like there s been an analyst show up here in the food now he s reading promo cards do i get paid for those promos extra know that did you want reforming yes well for both teams headed in different directions the pumps in a 13th straight home win ties the longest in school history and just this is the team in clemson coming into the year that there s no way with what they lost you could have said it s a playoff team but after seeing what they did against notre dame and how focused and good they played today and what weve seen a lion state yes vincent eve you have to think about that could be standing at the end yes and you may not have been able to predict that they would be undefeated right now but they are and theyre getting better it seems every week and they are going to be a factor to deal with in that florida state game so big and let s go for jump in calmness in georgia tech keith healthy theyre able to get<person player="broderick snoddy" race="UNK" position="FB">broderick snoddy</person>back let s hope they can get some of their guys back and salvage something out of this jerry punch is down there somewhere with devil yeah we would have judge davos sweetie and debo after last week s emotional win over notre dame their love people thought your kids may not play well what does this impressive performance say about your program were five and old and that was our goal this week you know it s really the same old thing for us each and every week proud of our guys you know it s about how we prepare we dont get caught up and all that other stuff i mean every week it s a huge game it s a great win for our team and you know i dont know what the final stats are but they couldnt run the ball and that was the difference in the game and offensively we flex our muscles and showed some explosiveness tonight in the running game and faster game so just proud of our team you know there was a lot of rhetoric that we wouldnt be ready to play or whatever but you know we just we just do what we do you said this week that your team does have to be good enough now to win a national title that s good enough to beat georgia tech but at what points to the tigers enter the conversation as a contender to win it all well i think we were in the conversation this summer you know were in the conversation but you know conversation dont win you know players showing up making plays every week consistently that s what wins so we got a long way to go were happy to be five in home happy for our fans but you know were just not even quite halfway home so were just going back to work boston college for the biggest game of the year congratulations go silver very thanks so much once again our final store from death valley 13 in a row for the tigers they beat georgia tech 4324 fred cunningham kerri punch our entire crew mike patrick thanks for watching let s go back to the studio
