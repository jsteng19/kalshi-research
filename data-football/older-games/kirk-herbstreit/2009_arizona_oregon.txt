============================================================

you are looking live at Arizona Stadium in Tucson for Oregon and Arizona will determine the road is closed destiny on Saturday Night Football on ABC presented by Southwest Airline folks it's going to be a fight to the finish in the desert tonight and the loser is going to be pushed to the brink in the pac10 Rose Bowl race it is wild and impacted by four the best conference grace left Oregon and Arizona start tonight and they could tell their own fate Oregon State still of the thick of things has is Stanford as we look at me the Saturday Night Football on ABC with record straight out front Musburger thanks for joining us and Kirk it is something special about making the Rose Bowl well if you're from the Big Ten country or of course from the pac10 which is it bigger the gift he gets to the third week in an open where you still control your own destiny to ultimately get to the big one you know for these players and these coaches it's just about locking in and trying to focus on the task at hand that's trying to win a game tonight what a beautiful night to be a sideline reporter here we are in November temperature right now 62 degrees in the desert sellout crowd and let's go down to Lisa Salters on that side I'm with Arizona coach Mike Thank You Brett Mike if you went out Arizona coast of the Rose Bowl for the first time in school history with all of that on the line how do you get your guys to forget about the big sister and just focus in on what they have to do to win tonight well I think it's pretty simple you just look at Oregon across the board it's a very dynamic team we're gonna have to play a very disciplined game on both sides of the line of scrimmage special teams go play full 60 minutes we're gonna play smart and hopefully put on great show Fiona you said it Oregon a very dynamic demon got probably one of the hottest all benches in a cluster right now what do you guys have to do to slow down their goal for at quarterback Jeremiah Masoli well I think the offense has to manage the clock a little bit we have to go on to drive scored touchdown try to take summon to my mental mind again come up with some big stops Arthur down on the other side coach Chip Kelly's first season every postmark pill I would try to keep his sideline clean akin to overall but 61 in the pack down the only team with only one loss John banana has the ball on the team for the Wildcats neighborhood that's a beautiful kickoff up to the 26 you're mine and coming out now is a young man Jeremiah Masoli who is so dangerous whether he runs or passes yeah I think that's what makes it fit in this offense so well the complex system they want to spread you out run the option throw the football Chip Kelly wants a quarterback who has the ability to run so that's exactly what he has a Masoli of a solely playing with so much confidence coming into this game Ricky Elmore the defensive front ready to get down there's the familiar for three of the school's goals Green option the solely we'll keep it on the first play from scrimmage of the night picked up about four yards make it second down and six and cam Nelson the senior safety who has the tackle in space tonight defensive coordinator Mark Stoops telling is that exactly right no the great indication of 20 tonight cam Nelson as you said not only playing in space but being responsible anytime the soli keeps the football he's got to be able to come up and run the board for Mark suits and make close so Lee's first pass down the near side receiver there's interference the field judge had the call working on the near sideline the ball was in the air in Devin Ross laid PJ Davis out his little hook and go pass interference defense they're trying to catch Roth cheating did a little hitch and go early in this game to take advantage of this enthusiastic crowd and an energetic defense balls in the air once the balls in the air you cannot knock the receiver down how about the pressure right here Elmore has you just talked about Brent getting in there very quickly and that's what you have to do with some help pressure Masoli with quick penetration you saw stood signal that he didn't think the ball was catchable in it will be solely a playaction rules will item he's in trouble incomplete a great opening defensive stand by the Wildcat outstanding defensive effort here as you can see the Flex it went to the left of trying to hold the linebackers they get on it for a second that was such great coverage downfield it allowed those linebackers that change the solely dowdy and nowhere does always the football second and ten and here comes their great running back for Michael James exploding he's closing in on the pack 10 alltime freshman rushing record Brent look how physical he is here he runs right through the linebackers arms and that's what you have to respect about the soul you know they lost their LeGarrette Blount early in the year more of a power back when they wanted 5 9 and 180 pounds 20 number 21 does it just have quickness and speed he has shown all year a great deal of toughness 22 yards on that run for James Masoli stands tall short of the first down on that first down pass Devin Ross was defending to an a that time to an a they receiver you see how this Drive Ins but you have to love how Oregon on hostile environment attacking the Arizona defense it's not hey with whether that's form here on the road on the first Theory hit the defense out of the field no no they're attacking Arizona Sacramento six James did not find the daylight Brooks read the defensive end who has been battling a high ankle sprain most of this year finally getting healthy and mark stoops told us this week to be fit the coordinator he said right now Elmore has all the numbers but he probably feels it fit most talented defensive lineman is 42 so him being back tight is very important for Arizona Marc recognizing the offensive set and resetting the secondary here on third and seventh while kept expecting to pass and they're going to give it stacked off for a first down Masoli came to Ed Dixon who is his preferred target Jeremiah Masoli calling people the doubters about him to go to throw the ball at the center reform is riding club and he hits it to his favorite target that Dixon rajamma that offensive line on third down and long and giving Masoli enough time to be able to find that open area and eventually get the ball into the hands of that Dixon big conversion there for the Ducks playaction and inside the 5yard line Jeff Maehl again showing here on first and ten trying to get the defenses come up and respect the running game and that's exactly what they did love to play calling for content Oregon is known for their ability to run the football what a perfect time to try to get the linebackers to get back up tempo right back at the line James hit it at back real terrific penetration to a lahmacun the young man the coaches called Cunha because that's his first name venturi holla maka make some play here how about Buddha / quick get right the Blitz was called and he's able to get through there nobody up front I think anticipating that blitz good job that's one way to slow down at powerful running game before you get started you tackle in the backfield second and goal and was whistled dead false start that'll cost a big five yards going in in the red zone start offense number 58 fiveyard penalty will remain second down second down and goal ball was put down the 15yard so we're trying to change it up he keeps it himself touchdown what a beautiful cut Arizona actually had him bottled up and then he cut back to the left side and made it to the end zone for the first touchdown of the night Jeremiah Masoli Brent you're right Arizona meritocratic esthetic Muscovy has got great vision it was like a wedding back with quarterback position also his ability not just see it but that first scimitar with LaMichael James Crawford is a tailback one piece all that cut back to the left he just simply outran the Arizona defense and they over pursued the play or in front tax on the extra point how's that again the ball loose ball they get it back recovery by Lok Lak by Jeff Maehl the wide receiver as the ball was free hey Fred this is the matchup we talked about from the beginning of this game cam Nelson is a key tonight in defending Missoni when he runs the ball in the option Jeff Maehl good job prepare I didn't think they'd have a chance to pick it back up but there's Nelson he's been reading his skis all night as soon as number eight white carries the football you're going to see Ken Nelson coming down in a hurry to try to stop it cam is the senior safety from Dallas his last game here in suzhou second and 14 Masoli off the fake durian deep and a perfect strike that time I mean this was some there were two receivers converging right here Harvey FLP and a get downfield he hits the crease and this is what I'm talking about with the solely throwing the football if you're going to crowd the line at respect to the baby for one the option hand the Michael James this is what they do to keep you on it and to keep the safety back and then they get back to the breadandbutter running the book James patiently waited and he is across the 20 yard line before he's brought down Deming los the path played a to an a is it just a big game except everything else up within this office now you get back to getting James the football the offensive lineman had a little bit better angles to be able to pick up blocks on a linebacker the safeties have to respect that vertical threat it's only throwing the ball and always then you get back into a rhythm with me all written by a couple Thrones from Mazzoli it opens up the office first down from the late pitch and the Wildcats were running forward they were certainly not fooled as Andre Crenshaw its McCurry is a senior from Lancaster California have to be really impressed with the overall team speed from the Wildcats defense their food in tonight doing a good job of running to the football 40 hole that time outside linebacker trunk great speed to the end second 13 and again throws a incomplete the line judge headed incomplete Crenshaw was working the sidelines right it looked like he got a putdown even always by accident I don't think he realized he was that close to the line of scrimmage but his left foot looks like he got down I'm sure they'll take another look at this one let's see if he catches the ball as if left foot touches the left foot looks like it down as he catches the ball very close with that right foot over on the out of bounds I think he if he had possession of the football as his let freedom play is under further review left foot was still down and when his right foot came down it was how to bounce watch his left foot as he catches the football it's down right there then he steps out of bounds but is always that left foot he's down that's a completion Larry Farina our referee here tonight and if this goes through the way you would expect it to go through all of a sudden the passing yards really starting to add up because Arizona's doing such a good job and being rocked in on on the running game its opening up some oneonone matchups for Chip Kelly and Jeremiah Masoli to try to get to down field he's got the accuracy to make you pay for it or be this this could be a big moment for for Arizona they fall back to scores they fumble is going into the end zone a little bit unlucky on that bubble they force back there by Nelson that they didn't recover it we're up here taking Arizona what a big break there were six red jerseys breath on the football it somehow Jeff Maehl was able to come away with it to game a break and when you're playing at home you have to be able to take advantage of those breaks it was determined that the receiver caught the ball with a put inbound and first and goal at the five yard line the point I was going to make is how perfectly he threw the ball again absolutely I mean he squeezed that bowl in the fungicide long time did strive to throw the two and a that got the ball down in deep in the arizona clearance but with a great throw and in this one he finds Crenshaw out of the backfield Lee came out of the backfield puts it pretty well covered by the way put it in a spot for only prints off the Mexica and here's where you're up against him goodness over we can run or pass bring James back to him James will cut back on the fiveyard line he's Earl Mitchell making the play how many times have we seen Oregon over the year this year in this position and Jeremiah Masoli on his own read keep the football and get upfield walking into the end zone see of Arizona has been bound into that tonight as you get down to that 5yard line you definitely have to be aware of a Phillies ability to run the football out of this area stretch the defense and he does not come oh and again oregan pounces on it David Paulson saved the possession number 42 by pouncing on the fumble but look what the Trevin way the cornerback and how he worked so hard to be able to get off of a block and then he fights up it I mean ed Nixon a big tide in is taking him on as a corner he fights through Dixon's loss and then has the presence of mind and not the football lose but how about Oregon second time on this Drive they pick up another loose football third and goal couldn't find the receiver now touch that Jeff Maehl lurking inside the 5yard line and number eight Jeremiah Masoli just keeps coming with his head looking downfield spots Jeff and they hook up at the end of this play he did not give up on this play he makes a little pirouette here get to the outside I look at mail sitting right there it's about the two are by Ed Dixon behind him it really could have on expressed there on the Arizona defensive back to the addicting behind him he had Mayo in front of it and he had to make a decision one way or another and another job of improvising there by Jeremiah Masoli if you're a receiver on this Oregon offense never give up on a play ball with the sole false start offense number 68 fiveyard penalty seee Kaiser the tackle let's a face of one tough hombre started his high school career outside of San Francisco and then went to fame st. Louis high school and Honolulu and moving on to JC and City College of San Francisco complected intercepted picked off at the 44 yard line sterling Louis the linebacker and authority team to go Arizona has got a chance for a huge lift what Arizona has been flirting with getting an opportunity to get the big girl over here last Drive Oregon put the ball on the ground twice they were unable to come away with his horn over this spot this time the deflection and a great job here of being able to find it by Sterling Lewis the ball is in the air who else can Melton knocks it up into the air it's curling Lewis the senior showing some very very nifty moves there after making a catch the hukou will be the running back number 28 Grigsby has not returned whistle he let the play delay of game offense number 8:05 boy the last thing you want to be the first down the last thing you get a big break crowds fired up here we go balls in Oregon's territory five yards delay a game second time they close and Arizona's offense have had that happy doing three consecutive three announce you can get running back what back to the original line of scrimmage format speaking of Austin Texas that's where Nick Foles is prominent to Westlake High School he broke drew brees records while he was in the school so here is policing standing tall over the middle for a first down to the 25 yard line that's William white this time they finally get the ball thrown down field cover to between the two linebackers Spencer pacing on one side Casey Matthews on the other that gives you an idea when Nick Foles gets in a rhythm back there what he can do gray free and a good job by sunny back to getting the ball down field against this Oregon defense again that's prowling this line of scrimmage there we go in this package Sonny dykes the offensive coordinator calling the plays upstairs against the fourman rush it will be first and goal Louis the man coverage right here on the outside is actually going to open it up for a little path to the outside good recognition by fold you see the linebacker pacing it takes him a while to come off the signin to get out there but the man coverage on the outside on Terrell Turner by Pullman's Jackson left a great ally to the outside that time the new old co is able to get out there to Toki very powerful lead back in the hukou set behind him you see number 31 now in his first down and goal plenty of time nobody opened and there is a penalty flag illegal formation offense five men in the backfield fiveyard penalty replay first down inexcusable mistakes by the Wildcat offensive selfdestructive especially when they're just starting to get some momentum they have something like this happen against sets a back now at the end of the world they're still inside the 10yard line here plenty of time we're still trying to execute here in this red zone area can't follow keep in mind or again started the game with the football Arizona can punch it in here the forces to be able to get the football back to start the second half huko number 28 to the left at the 5yard line is AJ Simmons sophomore from Oakland brendi talked about Rob Gronkowski big sicksick tied in how he's been out for the year this is the area where he usually would be their weapon this year backed against Oregon last year he had a field day against the Ducks defense but you take him out of the lineup and handcuffs with Sonny dykes like to do typically in the area now you see a more in the for wide receiver look trying to spread the defense's out even inside the 5yard line second and goal so to fade left side tuck ball touchdown Arizona kleiner sophomore from Las Vegas put the Wildcats on the board and a turnover leads to a touchdown and he's going to go up against the true freshman a great role by pros but one thing about Greiner is he is sick for going up against this Harris at 511 bulls knows that he puts the ball way up in the air we're only Kriner can fight over cliff Harris and bring that ball down great throw great execution by Arizona Sunday polls looking downfield got a man at the 42 yard line Dean Dean is in oneonone coverage and because of the great pass protection Bulls have time to come all the way back you can see how these work back it eventually first was able to look over and find them for a huge gain 26 yards to take a peek at this one maybe with and he came forward I think they're trying to see if the tit for the ball may have hit the surface or did he get his hands under the footballs for thickening another look for sure corner see the tip there yep nose of the football strikes the ground click Harris the freshman defensive back coming over you just get the feeling watching young Harris that in a couple of years he's going to be one of the better defensive backs in the pac10 he just sort of has that strut to him I know he was beating on that comeback on that but he just never quite gives up on a plays he saw against USC few weeks ago back in Eugene yeah when you're a true freshman in the college game and especially too packed in with such great skill you're going to you're going to make a play and then you're going to struggle for a couple plays and and you need to be able to have as the coaches say a short memory and he has that what's interesting Herbie is that Arizona's offense has gained as many yards this half as Oregon I remember we came in here raving about the Oregon attack and with good reason but I believe the star of the show so far has been the wildcat defense mode you know they've given up 14 yeah they've given up 14 points put a lot of that independent by Masoli improvised exactly and they've imposition to may play after further review the ruling on the field Sam when you guys say inconclusive evidence I no longer use the word indisputable I think the SEC has buried that forever okay okay what point is I think it all that whoever's in the booth it's his judgment and we'll go with it okay good about me to put a huge play Arizona campus all right the two things have gone against Arizona now the sudden tides starting to turn they're sensing an opportunity here to be able to get points on the board they'll have the two timeouts they put five seconds back on the clock so Foles the sophomore from austin transferred from michigan state ready to go nobody open deep thanks for throwing away he had two receivers working deep right was covered double covered actually and he couldn't get the man open in the middle of the field it's great coverage downfield here right there are a couple defenders staying with Dean he want to try to go to him but he's taken away completely and he tries to come back he didn't look back to Kriner minors taken away but the one thing I'm seeing in his first half from poles considering they were down 14 a presence he has a presence for a young quarterback the coaches love to see and he could continue to make good decisions like that one he's going to give his office to this Arizona State a chance to wind it up there we go interesting call they're trying to catch Oregon just dropping back and not respecting the run game in City if they could maybe hit a crease there for a quick 10 or 15 yard gain to get into field goal range but Oregon was ready for it therefore Gronkowski is also missed right they're still working on underneath route 10 12 yards coal's is an interesting story you mentioned he's from Austin Texas verbals to Arizona State ends up signing with Michigan State and then ends up transferring out the Tucson a heck of a journey for a redshirt sophomore after sitting out last year and it's transfer year it's got a very likable person out of turnout and nice young man obviously not afraid to get on an airplane third down and nine it's got the first down right sophomore from Oklahoma pick up the first down which will stop the clock fall second he's going to fire the ball until it saved the timeout kill the clock in the Quickfire nine seconds left how did that snap take three seconds empower Mike Stoops clock was stopped with 12 seconds to the snap firing to the ground how that takes three seconds they've got the timeout few more yards and they're gonna rush Alex in dejas out here having that last time out is big here if you can get about an eight to ten yard games give him a chance to the field goal rakh he had exactly what he wanted and the receiver couldn't hang on he also fought off some pressure and kept his focus downfield and Turner as a senior who's the captain tonight usually very reliable in fact of all the receivers he's the most consistent receiver Arizona has at that time unable to hold on to the football Alexander hush his uncle max is a wildcat legend another uncle Louis picked Arizona State in the National Football League so far as kickers go down arrows are in number one and a half it's a 30second timeout most familiar name sidan de Haas here are your BCS standings as we head toward the championship and all the bowl games and everything is still to be decided Georgia Tech Idol today we'll play Clemson for the ACC title I'm sure that John and Jessie will have details on how Clemson made that game LSU a loser at Ole Miss so they will certainly drop out and it's the two big guys Florida and Alabama care in that SEC banner Herve I was listening to you on game data today and I agreeing with all of your points that if you go down to the entire pac10 the conference might be a little bit deeper than the SEC not to take anything away or the two heavyweights Ford and Alabama carry the SEC but the depth of the pac10 47 yarder now Alexander Haas I think he just likes being booed and so uh Herbie I didn't recognize that team that was playing Michigan today what would they do a wire Oregon for you know a little info on how to look bad in a uniform did you like I like the unit is you have thought of recognize I thought it looked good I went back to nineteen feel like the traditional bucket 54 look but Jim Tressel wins eight of nine against Michigan the way they did it the way they've been doing it the last four or five weeks great defense running the football how about the Ohio State offensive line have all sudden turned around to become a strength the Buckeyes running the ball and they didn't overlook Michigan and they get ready to play the pac10 champion down the road January first in a row yeah don't get too excited and only Michigan hey don't ever say only dishes on this is a 47yard his longest is 37 that as long as you bet it is and they've got to break them up a little strong and they do let's go down to Lisa with coach Kelly thanks Brent 55 team game control the game and over a little bit the news is about messing the intersection necklace to destroy all what happened on that play Olga we welcome you back to Saturday Night Football on ABC presented by Southwest Airlines with Kirk Herbstreit and Lisa Salters I'm Brent Musburger Jeremiah Masoli and the Oregon Ducks lead Arizona 1410 however keep in mind that the Wildcats had scored the last two times they've handled the ball touchdown field goal and they get the first possession second half you know is very big for Arizona to be able to finish the first half the way they did okay I came up with a big touchdown off with the interception but they also had enough time to be able to get into field goal range and Alvin fundable minute without a doubt is favored in Arizona as we start this second half from the tenyard I the hukou will open as a running back brings b1 out reenter the shoulder has not returned there's a penalty flag thrown by the umpire something that Mike Stoops sawn up up in the first half if this ends up being a holding call personal foul hands to the face number 88 even 15yard penalty automatic first down that's Brandon bear one of the tackles as we go down below delecia well break you see NIC NIC Grigsby coming out of the locker room now back out onto the field I talked to Mike Stoops and he said that he was out further he evaluated at halftime and he is going to try to give it a go this happen so he is their ace carried only two times for eight yards in the first half going long and open man deflected just at the end and incomplete by Cliff Harris what a promising career number three has for the Ducks I love the call this is what we were calling for in the first half Oregon is leaving their corners isolated one on one and you have to make them pay for that there's the young freshman Harris playing pretty good position there on Kriner but if the ball is thrown more to the middle of the field Kriner have a much better chance but by stretching this defense it will give Bulls and it's running game a better chance second and 10 goes back to the flat and picks up seven yards on that completion to Dean and our look at the Pacific Life game somewhere we're going to compare Masoli and folds they're both throwing it four times that you might expect obviously in a rushing situation Masoli as a big heads they're picking exception by Masoli giving full there's no life to get that first touchdown third and three Bulls going to throw underneath for and did not get the first down run that pattern you got to get beyond the first down marker you're exactly right Brent linebacker defensive pacing or was thinking the same thing and he was eyeing the Arizona receivers right in the middle of the field he's just waiting for the receiver to come to cross the middle and I think actually if you think about it team may have just lost the feel for where he was he runs into the up fire and he's still two or three yards short when he caught the football getting that first down marker back deep for the duck jørgen survives the personal foul Falcon corner for the apartment so that Sun is being reviewed wild Brown the defensive back working down near the goal line take the ball over to the sideline the ruling on the field and a brilliant play on his part a fourpoint game if you just joined us Rose Bowl implications for both these teams if either wins out they will go to Pasadena meanwhile Stanford's under fire in the big game against Cal it's now 31 21 Cal in the fourth quarter of that one here it is first down intent for Jeremiah Masoli and the Oregon Ducks he'll throw from his own endzone goes deep ball incomplete that was Holland Wow Shamir Holland went a gutsy call here by Chip Kelly backed up inside his 1 yard line he gets oneonone coverage against seven draws who's very fast but Colin has great speed himself he got to the inside ball just sawed a little bit over the middle of the field there didn't give Holland look for the jam Mendes performance late in the first half by the Wildcats it shows over in the flat basically a run fly and is good for five yards that was Devin Ross blowing that play up to two an a he's going to come from his corner position and take two and a out of the suspicion of be able to get down field he does come a little bit high is going to be careful there but for a quarterback at five seven a hundred and seventyfive pounds not only has he passed he's very physical third and four for the duck and complete and the Ducks goes threeandout good field position coming up for the Wildcats to be able to be able to be able to flow down Jeremiah Masoli you have to be able to have corners like Devin Ross and Trevin Wade holding up when they're oneonone on the outside when you get that kind of coverage against the Oregon receivers it allows you to bring pressure and it allows you to confuse Jeremiah Masoli something he has not seen much of it all in his pac10 conference right the freshman putter right and midfield stretches the coverage team at the 31yard line what a huge loss it's prohibited crowd responded top coming from the right Orlando Vargas watch this block right here 38 boom just annihilates an Oregon defender that ponder was trying to come down field big block and imporant in the oneheaded best starting field position of the night look who's back as a running back the NIC Grigsby checks in his third carry of the night picks his daylight explodes to the 15yard line and what a lift he gives the Wildcats with his return despite three injury that shoulder the first half look at a patient pair print he picked his spot eventually for that zone blocking there's a creepy wait patiently finds it and then has that ability to explode through the hole see if you arm tackles and this is the difference with Briggs be the tough runner he's able to pick up matches are but get downfield in a hurry back on the sidelines he'll go to run it back Naruto to the eight yard line offensive line all of a sudden starting to take control up front here Furman Hall the left guard pulling around simple power play but what great surge that time by Arizona's front as they push the Oregon front seven back and gave them back enough room from missing the yardage they're back up top guard Herman hall is the guard who holds the lead second down what about Nick Foles anding off and not much doing on that play as Briggs we had returned for the cats Casey Matthews the junior middle linebacker making the tackle this time we've called Casey Matthews name tonight they call him to clue with his defense very intelligent junior of course his dad played Matthews older brother firstround pick on his USC last year playing for the Packers there's a lot of intangibles to the position third and three and Nick boots they do something touchdown Arizona leading for the first time and they go for deep at the running back position and they find young mr. booth and he gets the job done nick is on a Naperville Illinois nothing like bringing in fresh hair leg late in a football game and booth was able to get out there two linebackers on the inside actually blitz but the Arizona offensive line was ready for it especially bog Ozzy who came over the big block booth been running back behind folds again the 35 yard line and pleasant making the stop three minutes to go in Palo Alto California with a three point lead on Stanford 31:28 is the update on that game Stanford of course still in this 14 battle there is even a version of this that would put you at CPAC opposed Bob not going to second down and four who's our Steilacoom play us a tune the apples is going with a lot of these short throws quick passes and I think Oregon start to adjust there they're sitting on those throws that's why I thought it was so important it Kohl's get the ball downfield where he tried to get the football to stretch the defense and he's on those throws even if it you don't hit it at least it's going to give the defensive backs and especially the corners Colman's Jackson on one side and Chris Harris on the other the idea that the potential is there to pass them up event third and four for running around is brilliant right well structured play by sunny day only 34 yards RV it all starts with the offensive line are you kidding me I know they're only rushing three but the risk that you take when you rush three is you're going to give the quarterback enough time to finally find a receiver who can get into a window with the quarterback and that time right clouded but it took about four and a half or five seconds of pass protection it pulls didn't have anybody close to him the hukou checks back in as the running back in the throw again going to go for it all got him open and we complete Dan William right but that burst was right there right looked like that's what I'm talking about hit the ball look at the defensive backs they're sitting at seven and eight yards you can get behind them it's exactly the call that they need to make and right is there the ball just a bit overthrown with Sonny dykes seeing the same thing that I think we're seeing up here Oregon's secondary crowding that line it makes it pretty easy for a receiver like right with speed to get right behind it they'll go back to that second and ten close way high to the end zone ah back up again finet up right I saw him moving in on that I didn't know if Reiner had seen it on the corner of his eye hey Cooper we're trying to use a little body language to get him away from that you're right any time they get to the middle of the field to the back of that end zone but in there there they are again trying to stretch these three pens put pretty good coverage that time and both put it where he had to where nobody's going to be able to make that catch goes that short and it's a chance of being intercepted by Oregon third intent final minute of the third quarter and then run for the first out Naoko serve down expecting a longer pass an outstanding call here catches the Oregon linebackers offbalance pincer pacing or 35 had a chance to make the play but these backs all of a sudden teasing a bigger style back from Arizona as they get down to the third and fourth straight guy there who so impose about 220 pounds he dykes keeping the deck defense offbalance with this play college was ready for the right there's a penalty flag thrown at TJ Ward he came up with a little demonstration and let's see if he incurred the wrath of the officiating crew a little bit of hot dog in here okay unsportsmanlike conduct number two of the deep end after mr. Hall first out he that is the right call all over college football we see players who sometimes act appropriately and other times act inappropriately that but according to the rule book that should be flagged every single time across the country and he was taken out by his coach Chip Kelly and her number TJ Ward has played a good game we made a fine play on that and there is portrait over on the sidelines hopefully he's trying to fire that offense up we begin the fourth quarter where Kirk Herbstreit Lisa Salters I'm Brent Musburger a pac10 showdown first and goal and bulls hands it off for the Wildcats huko and their hukou school the battling for yards refusing to go down and impression the who thrown that big offensive line it looked like a giving stop for a short gain he just kept pounding kept moving that pile offensive lines from the people around look like it's for progress but look at him you don't want to stop they gave him possession all the way down to the five yard line another one of those tough Texas suck it down and gold Bowles comes back deflected incomplete Turner the target partners the target but pulls that time forcing this throw one of the few mistakes we've seen him make he got a little bit greedy a little bit impatient when we go to the left good job of coming back to the right but he's got to make sure that he's falling back on his back foot trying to throw the football his accuracy was all through the football behind Oregon almost stepped in front of that and there was nobody that would have stopped that the fitter from picking it all the way back third and goal Arizona brilliant right the sophomore from Oklahoma and a little bit of daylight for the Wildcats barnable hole send a fax on the extra point the braska has wrapped up the big 12 north they will play Texas for the big 12 championship in two weeks and here Arizona and Oregon battling for a possible Roseville over here on the corner lost control of ball picked it back up and is down at the 20 yard line when I was surprised on third down to see the soft coverage from Oregon this is DJ war than safety and I think he's communicating here to Luis to come over here to help watches his play worked itself out and Ward starts to see hey I need somebody right here to help me out somebody needs to come over here and help me out lookouts off the coverages and right just going to go out here the simple throw there's nobody there throws it for a touchdown and horns looking back guys I need somebody to help me out first down and ten and the sewing Jonesy so it is down to three these two plus Oregon State are in control and complete as the ball is twoadays hands and now the battle for the road Corrigan this game and Oregon State win a boat there in Arizona win this game I get there is own estate at USC there in the Beavers went out and Arizona loses one game they're in so the big three Masoli and finding remedy Nixon came back to the backside for an Oregon first down remember early in the game we talked about Mike Stoops a Marxist saying the one thing they had to do was to be able to take away the running of the soli and the Michael James and you look at this football game at this point James has not been in backer 46 yard Masoli 40yard Mzoli's arm is going to have to hit them back into this Dam he is doing just that right now on this Drive that was Davis with Ross the defender for the cats one of the few defenses we've seen this year able to slow down Masoli and hit him into some obvious passing down he completely taken away the run again you can see what they've done throughout this year especially accomplished play compared to the third join tonight again so forth decent everybody's doing their job you can't really focus on the defense and say boy the linebackers are stepping up at the defensive line when you play at this kind of complex system if everything's connected to everything else within the diesel constructors if you pencil by the line secondary left out on an Iowans and now another big Throwdown the roses are out at Tucson Masoli will try to run 40s got it Camp Nelson hanging on and preventing a huge gain the first time it brought pressure they brought the linebackers it's the first time that we've seen the goalie out making a play was in the running game since maybe back in the first charity to this football game they've completely taken him out of the game when it comes to his ability to run remember Oregon feels that they can out condition you in the fourth quarter that they're up tempo attack and keep them going middle high caught by the 5yard line that is Jeff Maehl making a huge play for the Ducks and it will be first and goal a chip mail along with it Dixon to the goto targets but his Oregon office the ball is I pretty good coverage by way with the body position by mail it's the reason he's able to touch this ball donor guys kept himself in the defenders at depend on the back end made it much easier to go to take the cat so Lee's going to throw incomplete way to steep it is playing he better get rid of it the hurry and Savior Kelly that time got after and made him get rid of the football before he is ready great coverage again Brent downfield this defense is well fooled and what knowing what to expect from this play action pass checking the sign James looks through just short of the end zone trelaina by Ted I'd like to put a little bit more depth with LaMichael James when they get inside his 10yard line if one's inside here they're running that option book but they're trying to attack the interior of the Arizona defense stairs had a chance to look at this groups alignment they can change up the offense sidelined the soli walks in with that hole opens up off his fake to James there's just nobody there to take the quarterback on to we hop you want to help us do a hawk and lacA through Facebook funa funa funa comes down that time and it made it so easy that's what that's what you're used to seeing from Oregon and this option attack especially inside the 5yard line they commit they take that back away and it makes it an easy read from the sole Jeremiah Masoli brings the duck offense out with a first and ten at the Arizona only five yard line James on a cutback hole there's 14 more yards for James and Masoli and James starting to pick it up here Herbie it looks like they may go up tempo here but there's a vision of LaMichael James he's been complete he's in 100% speed mode and he's able to see a cutback to the left and he gets there real quick little jump up steps back to the inside 65 yards freshman rushing record the danger giving something back and working in battle and gain about half a yard on that play just look looked like he was going to lose about three but that's how shifty LaMichael James from Texarkana Texas is once at a high school football game down it takes Arkana d russian for 322 yards in a single game yes he was recruited by the Longhorns but he wanted to leave the state and he's happy to be up in Eugene and there second down and nine slowly boxes throws it away and Nelson on top of the receiver David Paulson great coverage top of the screen 20 red right there Tim Nelson staying with pulse and it's a happy face by Masoli and he's trying to get Nelson to buy out the station it's an option attack giving it would come up to the line of scrimmage that's the discipline of cam Nelson's been playing with all night Bolton at I named try to get behind him and it was with him cried for on third and nine James stretching it to the Lorraine ended as he cause of the 30 yard on by Kevin Wade the sophomore from Round Rock Texas number 24 and ear rotten Mark Stoops has big leaves tonight with Devon Ross on one side of the boundary corner at 24 Trevon way both gods zeroed in on what their assignments are dying and holding up and not only a coverage for it but also it runs the porn they're very consistent this for the top Morgan Flint with a 43yarder hips the crossbar goes across we are deadlocked had it all the way to Lyon Drive from centerfield I think the crowd thought it was going to be short he didn't hit it very well I think I will take it yeah point of the whole eight minutes and two seconds remain deadlock Arizona leaded by Ken and the depth bowel right back line drive kick off fielded on the floor by talk to the 29year our live Nabucco is the running back footrace underway Joseph Destin's Oh touchdown daehan's tax on the extra point and so here we go 311 for Masoli and right away he is for nine yards to open up this series with the surehanded Jeff mailed the junior from California one thing about that interceptions it saved the timeout so they still have the two timeouts left clock at 2:45 and you made a touchdown and the extra point you look at the clock under three minutes the time for this kind of offense is not a factor yet I know they haven't had a great night but once they're executed the way they're capable of executing making it down the field in a hurry even though they're known for their ability to run the football after passing in the tops across the field Masoli is quashed rustam o'clock again as he steps out at the 34 yard line once he gets to the outside that's what Ricky L Morin and Brooks read on the other side have to be aware of in these kind of situations there's your print years back you know they're going to throw the football for the most part you can't let me slowly break contain and get outside becomes James toward the first down marker battling to pick up extra yards at the end of that run the alltime freshman rushing record he broke tonight for the pac10 and I think he shows you a little bit more than speed on this front this is what I love about the Michel de good five nine one in that amazing second and third effort to get across for the first down Masoli is forced to the left 12 out of our anytime you can force a righthanded quarterback to go left your odds increase of ruining the play it's just that such a tough throw for all the greatest you've ever lived on the move to throw back you're coming to the left second down and 10 Dixon J to the top of the tide in first down and out of bounds as they work the near side with Holland good recognition quick throw soft coverage that time from Ross has his speed Mercia Tamir Holland to transfer from USD matched up oneonone got the ball out quick easy throw first down 148 to go bollock Arizona 45 and reaching down and making the grab with Wade depending on the play male working on that far side here we come again men at the half second down and five fire to the play ball start costly finally against Oregon offense number 58 fiveyard penalty still second out against the junior tackle Kaiser guilty of an infraction so it will come back and make it just a little bit tougher now with 126 Mark Stoops right now has asked his defense to fit back in coverage in Oregon has thrown a lot of clothes here in the last quarter a place underneath the coverage quick simple throws and surprising Arizona's giving and he can throw away those consult opinion close that cushion to keep it again the Arizona Territory working the middle of the field and dropped by Davis pressure again is there but the soli has just enough time to be able to put the ball in the hands of Davis Davis would have put them in scored in three he were able to hold on to that test 106 for the game eleven former soldier I'm trying to run colder Davis he's got a chance he's got the first down a gusty third down running play and LaMichael James picks up the first down there's deficient in that quick yeah I mean the one thing you love about James not just the speed and a toughness but the vision and how quickly he accelerates once he sees the cream now it is stopped with like 40 hauls a little bit shaken up on the wall until one of the linebackers and Earl Mitchell their great defensive lineman limping a little bit to the side line and Oregon's got him under the gun right now there's twenty nine yards away from a touchdown there inside of a minute soli cupcake comes back rear side of the receiver was down he had slim so it will be second down at 10:00 Masoli wanted interference on the floor he got the call earlier in the football game on a pump and go like that we had Davis oneonone with broth ball was in the air walk through Davis out of bounds they gave him this early in the game but they can get the bonus second down and 10 here's Masoli working back to the middle is short of the first down come on continues to run out which other nail they've got a hurry got to use the timeout here stop the clock go ahead two timeouts able to use bottle of hair students to figitus pays in a barn this games over better be careful they just want to be a good spot to Westham here for my boy so pick we go to overcome a fee for overcoming a filled in the halls read out tonight in Tucson another sellout crowd Jim Weider good the outstanding athletic director heard they run a tremendous allaround sports program women's volleyball through the years Jenni bench in the softball team the baseball team not just football they've had a great basketball team now coach Stinson turned the football team certainly the white final 31 seconds now oregan try to force overtime third down and five remaining our current that 18 yard line years personam try to get somebody open trying to position receiver throw it away and we're out of the forks out could not get the kind of reaction from a wide receiver that he wanted that time right I think he got a little greedy there he had his back leaking out in the backfield and he either didn't stand for you waiting for at Dixon too tight and too clear into the end zone but he has the michael james for a first down for a short gain if he wanted it but I think he was focused downfield on the big game here's your fourth out 23 seconds timeout I'm not a call by stoops in Arizona at all three to go has his brother mark right there remember Mike was a safety of up at Iowa plate for Hayden Fry then went into coaching work for Bill Snyder Kansas State on the defensive side of the ball went with his brother Bob down to Oklahoma became the defensive coordinator and about six years ago became the head coach out here at Tucson brought brother Mark who was working with a secondary of Miami to come out and be his defensive coordinator Mark Stoops has been offered a few head coaching jobs but he's very satisfied to stay right here in Tucson his name will come up again during the coaching Derby will break out over the next couple of weeks glad you're bringing that up because I think a lot of times Martin Stoops people talk about him he's the brother of Mike threw him boxes driving more been able to go down for resume to be out on his own to really show what he can do with one of the top defensive minds in the country fourth down and five it has come to this here's Masoli got the first down 18 ticks of the clock left male the reliable one got to make quick decisions here Jim Kelly trying to get everything into Jeremiah Masoli still has the one Denard's away rolls to the left fire on a bomb stop the clock that is Davis 11 ticks left here Phil Chapel to two or maybe three shots into the end zone again with that timeout if they fall short it can still use that timeout Dixon and Mail have been goto guys we're one point away from a tie at a Dixon with six seconds to go makes the grab an end zone a big extra point coming up from Morgan Flint some of those students who had surrounded the sidelines ready to go in the field are an extra point away for maybe going back to watch over time six ticks left morgan flash that's that put down and flex saves it Nate Costa was the holder with a good pair of hands at time we're deadline Brent how about Edie Dixon moving right here to the inside make some little boot to the outside to get just enough room getting away from Robert Goldman he was flexed out little boot to the outside golden bid on it and then he goes back to the middle of the field and a perfect throw and how about the poise by Jeremiah Masoli leading his team down all the way down the field and here's Mike and Mark Stoops a bit frustrated there but an amazing drive there with the game on the line by Oregon and Jeremiah Masoli Bigler seconds left and Kohl's starts to limber up and look at some of the students are making their way back to the seats and what a good job Kosta did with that hold he didn't panic he got it shut down and that could have been a disaster right there I didn't realize it snap ahead I'm telling it costed a brilliant job it found saving in a moment Oh God you imagine all after all that time is slowly in the offered final six seconds of regulation take it along the ground they'll take a knee can we see the hold one more time because I I just can't believe it could come down to a simple thing like the extra point which you just assumed is a given but the backup quarterback make constant takes this one hopper he's like a shortstop sign him up for the Ducks baseball it is so critical that he didn't have it Oh yep this cool attempt his goal set it there and also Morgan's timing was not throwing off he hesitated I know right and so we will go to overtime the battle for the Rose Bowl continues in Tucson we have overtime for the Ducks Masoli incomplete it'll be second down and 10 like we were saying it's what it should be on 31 31 both teams controlling their own destiny to get to a conference championship and hopefully the road full and they're in car man he's been doing it all night Devin Ross fighting for that football here comes James first a middle five first and goal LaMichael James who tonight set the new freshman rushing record for the pac10 does it again about his jump cut and how quickly he accelerates off of them if you give him just a little bit of room virtually impossible for a linebacker to be able to make the packbow in the alley now first then gold from isola they check that over to the end zone I should say the sideline the coaches upstairs I've had a chance to see what Arizona will set up the what kind of personnel they've got whatever it was a James up with big Earl Mitchell can't say enough about that defensive tackle number 49 been all over the field James may have to check out his game he'll bring in Andre Crenshaw in to the football game remember Brent again we've seen it over the year and already gets inside a five yard line there big trend as the kids the ball the hands in the soil all with that option fake and keep it into the end zone I'm going to make that was French Oh goodbye to a hollow Makkah so to hello Makka number eight stands in that hole and makes the play Kiwi hala maka that time holding on for dear life and he didn't have to defend the speed of James who had to check out for the power that time for Crenshaw James is back slowly rolling to the left fires in zone and coming up with a brilliant catches Jeff Maehl they accepted breath I don't know if there are very many receivers in the pac10 conference much better than Jeff male 6 175 pounds looks like he grew up playing backyard football his whole life always coming up with receptions like there's a crucial moments in the game lays out and makes the catch of the year at this point for the Oregon office extra point is capped on a now Arizona needs the match a 7 we will be able to Nick Foles and the Wildcat offense Jeff Maehl comes from all the way from the right side and he's going to fight the top corner Devin Ross never gives up on the play and I love at the very end Brent he came back towards the football taking away the angle for Ross to be able to get his hand extended to knock the ball away just at the end he started to come back towards the football which gave him a chance to make that catch that was beautiful Nobuko will be the running back behind goals there's a little flare screen dean the receiver and Cliff Harris the freshman defending it and it will be second down Ward got sent was able to make them pretty good read that time came up quick but really it was the young freshman Cliff Harris getting off of the block and by the time you know by the time the receiver had a chance to get out deal there was nowhere to go forming defense on that one second down and now go and I will bring up third down we cannot stress the importance of what this night means for both of these teams trying to make it a Pasadena to take on Ohio State Oregon State defeating Washington State earlier so if the Ducks can hang on they would play Oregon State on a Thursday night on ESPN for the right to go to the Rose Bowl in Pasadena but first things first third and four here for the Wildcats and they're still alive first and ten the hukou carrying the load as Grigsby reinjure that shoulder tonight Oregon just gets wrong that time with their blitz from pacing or the linebacker he shot through the wrong gap the hukou was able to get through that hole but Paysinger took himself right out of position by coming off to the more the middle of the offensive line booth now the right gets the call have you forgotten gr20 senior from Naperville Illinois Brent how about Adam grant the right tackle on that play he didn't have anybody to block he's just kind of standing there and boots ran right into his back that time grant unintentionally actually slowed down the ball carrier 2nd down and 7 for full xun back in the gun play loose ball Lyman goes down Oregon digging fort duck say they've got it if so it's open if they've got this loose ball Ducks are celebrating hang on now they're coming out and Arizona has got the football on the other side Herman Hall who is the backup left guard I'm standing there saying boys after you get done wrestling and pointing turn around because I got something you might want I'm pregnant we don't Hartman Hall here hold the football any of these guys that's a scrum we got 340 counters if you're fighting for it pink dot c70 look at Glen football we're going to give it to Arizona how'd you like to be at the bottom that one Brett you know what goes on the clock with that pot third down and seven need a touchdown and an extra point to keep going and let's see if we're going to have a little review here the previous play is under further review I'm not sure anybody could see anything on this pretty Buick went for it there what do you what do you say is your new rule it's based on the judgment us on the judgement of the man who's making the liturgy what exactly is he gonna flick that here got some wide bodies in there pushing pushing each other around it looks like Oregon has they were pretty confident running off the field thinking that one of those white jerseys into the fallen on the football so here we go third down coming out the hukou has checked back in so he'll be the running back 38:31 first overtime Oregon with the lead update by souls and trouble deep trouble the penalty flag is thrown pass was incomplete and Stoops being restrained a little bit here I think he wanted a late hit on his quarterback to go off ooh number 39 was in on him personal foul face mask logic offal incurs the personal foul poles member last week against cow where he had that decision where the ball came back to and he ended up catching it and trying to throw it again kind of reminds you that as he's rolling to his right we didn't see anything there to come to the face it looked like he had grabbed girl as I he had wrapped around a little early with the other hand that one view indicated that he quite possibly was there that official put even look at first out in gold nothing doing for another go T Jay Ward brought the hammer you've got luck didn't celebrate the hammer this time but TJ Ward when he's healthy member he had a high ankle against Boise State he missed six games but when Ward is back there patrolling the middle of that defense seemed to see more more big hits coming for the back end second down and goal Bulls on a short drop tires to the endzone for the touchdown and extra point away at perk Reiner his third touchdown catch of an eye a breakout night for girag Kriner the sophomore from Las Vegas great job eyeful watch his foot more watch his patience waiting for Kriner to work pick back to the outside he had a slant initially designed to go back to the middle taken away by two defenders he flies back to the outside and bold hangs in there with him for our second overtime late on a Saturday night and the pac10 championship is on the line as far as getting in the driver's seat to get to potentially a pac10 championship we wouldn't want it any other way to have a chance to get to the granddaddy of all right I have done a trio ver time game involving the team from Arizona but that was the Phoenix Suns up where the second overtime here to divert I don't have a red eyed you didn't go I did not like you know I'm good I'm good well night well here we are Oregon State wants the Ducks to win this game tonight and then they'll play for everything on a Thursday night in Eugene first down and ten for full takes the flare pass goes back down to complete out of the back of the end zone so Kriner has been the goto guy hurt and I made a leaping catch for his first touchdown pulled away from everyone for a 71 yarder and then just moments ago his third touchdown of the game in overtime so it is now second down and 10 in a way then being third down and ten and Kinney row number 58 let me mention on some all pac10 teams he's a junior he's had a long beach california and he is a good one first down was a throwaway down they didn't really didn't have much of a chance to execute on that first play setup second ten second ten it was really a one receiver rout either Kriner was going to beat his man or bowles had to throw the football away Oregon was able to get pressure but was the coverage downfield on Kriner that forced him into that throw pose nothing doing so that was embarrassed blinks Ferris the senior from San Jose making the defensive play on Kriner third down remember this will home run earlier this is a touchdown for Kriner hit they hit it perfectly it was against the Blitz he got behind the bliss two linemen got down field and went all the way for a touchdown no shot that time Alex in dejas this is a 41yard made one from 47 but missed that 24 yard so here we go slide it in for the bill go oregan can win it with the touchdown settle for a field goal and we'll move to the third overtime and a hoss being pretty consistent tonight he's missed one but that one not only the distance but been very accurate especially when the pressure has been on now let's see what Jeremiah Masoli and the oregon office could do against this pesky wildcat defense the solid inside the 5yard line strikes on first down with that Dixon who cut the kind touch down pass he's right here going to take him out on really it's almost like a real route from a fullback they get him downfield nobody picks him up they were focused on mail on the post to the middle of the field it opened it up again to the outside for big at Dixon with OB Masoli or will it maintain will be James or will it be misil James short of IANS own the lower yard away Kirby from making a Rose Bowl showdown at home against Oregon State the reason was solely does that in each time as he's trying to get a read from upstairs on who they want to option whether it's the defensive end or a defensive lineman second end goal miss Tobias it will be third down great job that time they knew to expect Masoli keeping it in 15 Dave you're killing lowering the boom right there in the hole you also saw bigger ol Mitchell coming from the backside but really it was about Xavier Kelly making that read and keeping the solely out of the end zone the Soleil oregan wins it the Ducks will play Oregon State in Eugene for the right to go to the Rose Bowl both teams walking to the bitter end here tonight let's go to lease over coach Joe thanks Brett chip what was the key to that gametying drive at the end of regulation you know I just saw Joe munzo a hell of a quarterback and we never over think we're out of anything and we pride ourselves on finishing that little bit in my half hours well that's one heck of a football team okay so the number was up now down 10 and the second has what started to go right for you guys now we just try to make a plays we got a lot of players and when you fight that's a good game you know if you're going to sustain it's going to be an ebbing and flowing and you knows a heck of a football game back up until clean all right thank you graduate how fitting it comes down to a play for Masoli to have a chance to lead his team into the endzone for a touchdown in a victory in a hardfought game to see the mutual admiration respect from both head coaches when they met each other at midfield their butt Masoli fights his way in and leads his team to a comefrombehind victory in a hostile environment here in Tucson that's a big win there have been that civil wars in Oregon but there has not been one as big as the one that is coming up on the night of December 3rd Oregon and Oregon State will play for the right move to go to the Rose Bowl go do it here tonight in Tucson
