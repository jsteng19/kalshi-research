============================================================

we welcome you to the 28th edition of the Outback Bowl here from Tampa Florida Evelyn's 21st year it's the big 10 against the SEC to start the new year here they come from Iowa City the hot guys and from Baton Rouge the LSU Tigers happy new year everyone Mike Tirico John Burton lishus off is Hector your pal have to New York maybe in your hometown boy you know for LSU just a couple years ago they played for it all we played the national championship so a bit disappointed this is not where they wanted their season to end yet John their last regular season games Zach Mettenberger their senior quarterback hurt that means we'll see Anthony Jennings make his first start here this afternoon and a New Year's Day bowl game not many true freshmen do that at the quarterback position but fortunately for Jennings LSU has surrounded him with great skill players and it starts with their tailback jeremy hill hill is a downhill back 235 pounder with breakaway speed he ran for almost 1,200 yards this season he's a difference maker and when they throw the football they've got two bigtime receivers starting with Jarvis Landry who's a circus catch machine and Odell Beckham jr. just won the horney award for the nation's most versatile football player Ellis she's loaded around the young trigger my disappointment Iowa City last year they were a Four Winds heap good finish though they won their last three for their last five so Iowa comes in here today at 8 and 4 and John it's the same formula we've seen for about a decade and a half with Kirk Ferentz team very good offensive line they can run the ball and their defense very solid this year well they're tough they're disciplined and they play with effort just like Iowa always plays with and they're led by James Morris their middle linebacker he's a coach on the field he's a great communicator against he's no idle offenses he has very good range he's a good open field tackle he'll need to do that against the running quarterback today he has very good song awareness Mike he's got four interceptions 41 starts the fouryear starter James Morris is a difference maker for the hot guys and we'll see that veteran Iowa defense against the first time starter Jennings at quarterback first as LSU will get the ball to start this 2014 Outback Bowl started raining pretty heavily about 9:00 a.m. this morning it's been intermittent in between men we look for showers through the day that is Odell Beckham jr. back deep to receive Mike Myers sets a kick and off we go in 2014 and Beckham will take it from the to the numbers Beckham run down the 23 yard line and alesis such as let's talk about that first time starter at quarterback for LSU and his teammates say they have no doubt that he is ready for this moment they say he didn't even blink when in the Arkansas game when Mettenberger got hurt led them down the field on that gamewinning touchdown drive that gave us confident that he could execute the game plan wide receiver Jarvis Landry told us and his mobility would help us a lot of course Iowa's defense number seven in the country they're going to be looking to get after him but they don't really want to talk about it they couldn't run a lot of plates because we're gonna follow Jeremy hill on the opening snap of the game it's a Hawkeye territory and a big run of 42 yards and run that power play LSU most quarterbacks hand the ball off but they toss it they're going to get a doubleteam neighbors is going to get the gig out and Jeremy Hill gets the corner and he has breakaway speed uncommon for a 235 pound back what a start for LSU Hill who ran for nearly 1,200 yards at 7 per carry as rare of this Iowa defense so good against the run top 20 in the country the 32 toss it right back to the sophomore buy class at the Baton Rouge Louisiana give to Louis trinket Passat made the tackle for the hawkeye's up front this trinket facade he's added about 50 pounds Iowa career Mike he's a typical Iowa Hawkeye football player some of these guys don't emerge until late in their careers but Ricca Passat has really anchored this front for the hot guys and they're much improved up front two runs for him he takes a break Terrence Magee junior out of Franklin sin Louisiana in there right at that field goal range line that you've become familiar with throughout this regular and Bowl season and McGee with a run the BER shy of the first down Tanner Miller honorable mention on Big Ten safety made the tackle so John what are you expecting to see from LSU offensively with the first time starter Jennings at quarter I like what they've done hand the ball off to a real good back early and try to get it some favorable down at distance situations where they can run some bootlegs some high percentage passes don't be surprised if Jenny's first throw isn't a playaction bootleg off of a primary run go back in its third and one Iowa stuff's the line but Hilton all right able to get through for the first down at the 21 yard line you know like this LSU offensive line has gone through a lot of changes they had some injuries in their last regular season game against Arkansas good to see their center back Elliot Porter number 55 he got hurt midway through that Arkansas game and over there on the right side you see the right tackle back as well Hawkins Gerald Hawkins redshirt freshman injured his left knee the flag thrown as Carl Davis second team allbig ten performer off to the neutral zone offside number 71 defense contact fiveyard penalty first down see Greg Burke's rest of the crew big 12 third team on the field here this afternoon one of the rare occasions you'll see LSU in a huddle offensive coordinator Cam Cameron has kept it up tempo most of the time this year Dylan gourd male rather tight ends mutts gourd moved over the right path for him inside the tent head up to five but he's out of bounds it'll be first in gold he's gonna be marked at two six skate of 11 ELISA say play they ran on the first play of the game it's a power play but they toss the ball to jeremyhill they get the kick out block a good block by Beckham on the perimeter and jeremyhill is taking it to the hot guys earlier there's thousandyard back LSU's hats and Steven Ridley back in 2010 to move to the second best singleseason total before this afternoon is done bursting goal for the freshman man theny Jennings another handoffs been all on the ground he'll stop there at the five bots Hatter Miller John mentioned earlier Cam Cameron he's calling the plays of course he was fired late in the season by Baltimore Jim Caldwell Iowa alum took over the Ravens last year took him to the Super Bowl Cam Cameron hired by his good friend Les Miles he and less on the same staff at Michigan so knew each other from there Ann Arbor days and cam has come in and really give this offensive boost yes he has and he's given it an NFL flavor they do a lot of different things running the ball different formations and their passing game in spite of what you've seen today is very good our people in the toss just couple yards for Kenny Hilliard one at four backs we'll see he was tightened up by Kirk see the captain the linebacker on his Iowa team set up third and goal here comes some big guys for the Iowa Hawkeyes three defensive linemen of diss check did his goal to gall situations at LSU continues to pack it in and pound it let's see if there's a playaction from Jennings 270pound fullback JC Copeland there's a couple yards ahead of Hill Jennings Kings to the end zone and it's at LSU touchdown on the opening drive don't tell me Les Miles didn't take advantage of these 12 bold practices Mike you have a different quarterback you have a different style of offense and he's put the option back in LSU Tiger football it's a speed option off the left side and you see what Jenni's brings to the table small strongarmed met burgers not one who was going to be running those types of plays and will you think back over the pedigree of LSU football as you look at the injured Mettenberger and the players like the Jordan Jefferson Ryan parallel even back in the day a little more it's rusty building that mix the option in touchdown the extra point is added by the freshman kicker Kobe del OC eight plays all runs he'll open it with a 42 yarder and capped off by the run for the touchdown by Jenny plus it's going to be a speed option off your left side and you're going to see Hill number 33 stay in pitch phase but look at the option the end man on the line of scrimmage Creek christian curtsy number 20 took the tailback and Jenny takes it to pay dirt but you have to really like what LSU did with a freshman quarterback in the opening drive against Iowa all on the ground Mike they handed the ball to two different tail backs and they physically took it to the Iowa Hawkeye defense there Kirk Ferentz team with that very good run defensively mentioned John only given up 300 yards a game 121 yards rushing but you always put that asterisk that lack of the dynamic offenses in the big 10 this is certainly a step up in class and quality and that LSU offense comes back that's got to be a good feeling for Jennings as Lisa said a year ago graduating high school he graduated in December loaded up on his classes to be ready to take part in LSU spring ball Safiye and i Mettenberger all year gets the chance here and gets it on the board states harris that dallas texas will kick it for LSU chorten cotton up to get the kick at Bob Todd bumps into his own man keeps it alive he's brought down over at the 20 yard line LSU looks a little bit fired up here to start the game Connor neighbors made the stop of course we set the table for you for the granddaddy of them all by 100 Rose Bowl game Stanford and Michigan State two very similar team to play terrific defense in their own right set to go head to head and Pasadena yeah that'll be a physical game that's a double chin strap game right there don't miss it you coming up 4:30 Eastern sues we're done this is took down the remote settle in they pea college football here on ESPN j.crew not sophomore Weston Florida is the quarterback for Iowa team loves to do their work on the ground behind the team your running back Mark Weiss little s game for spilled by Jaylon mills LSU fans is starting at safety today will detail that a little bit first out what do you think of this sophomore ruin out whose from about four hours from here Weston Florida this kid is sharp Mike he does a lot of the line of scrimmage you can see right away they've up the tempo they must be aware of the LSU Bengals speed on defense they can run to the ball they're playing a lot of young players this year they lost a lot of underclassmen to the draft but if you throw bubble screens against this team they will find the ball quickly Devon st. Martin manly with the reception that lost a yard and quickly it is third and long for Iowa's offense Damon Bullock to back out the pattern grew dot throwing under thrown incomplete he got hit as he throws which around Smith now the flag comes in late it was the pressure by Anthony Johnson that forced the ball out early and then Jalen Mills who starting at safeties Nick corner we've got to start safety today involved in coverage too now the conference of the officials after the play personal foul number 28 defense 15yard penalty well Mike Anthony Johnson you said it he didn't hit the quarterback he planted him number 90 off your right side crushes ruh doc and in a penalty lake down the field occurs unnecessary by Mills I had nothing going on that drive but it stays alive because the 15 and from the 36 is slipping a fall for book who will lose a yard now on the LSU defensive side job something important we should let everyone know and you may have heard it late last night or herded on gameday ego Ferguson perhaps their best defensive tackle Todd McClay has Freitas the fifth best defensive tackle he is not with the team of medical issue was what the LSU folks told us he has not been with the team here in Tampa so they're missing one of their big push men in the middle that's the tight end CJ Fedora wits if I was going good you're going to see a lot of him and they'll call the first down at the 46 yard line I think they need to go to Fedora whitson space against DJ welter the linebacker for LSU he's going to struggle in oneonone coverage in these open formations and once again there goes that Iowa Hawkeye tempo even quicker than we've seen them during the years mark Weissman the junior captain runs to the left and gains a halfdozen get seven well they're trying to wear LSU out they know they're light inside with Fergus and not making the trip I spin again this time he is stopped it's a davyous white ball freshman vote by the coaches down in the Southeastern Conference it's third to couple you know I know this office reminds us of the New England Patriots Mike because head coach Pete Kirk Ferentz has Bill Belichick check background and you see a lot of the elements of the New England Patriot office when you watch the hawkeye's multiple tight ends and uptempo football Jake Busey one of those tight ends motions of his stack on the near side LSU hasn't covered so rude Ock has nowhere to go with it we has to run out of bounds with the loss of a couple of yards and it'll be fourth down DJ welter escorting him to the sidelines and the Hawkeye is gonna punch it away that's a good defense by LSU they played some coverage and looked like Iowa's expecting mantoman add a twoman route nowhere to go at the football and once again good team pursuit by the LSU defense Connor corn grant sophomore punter in for the hawkeye's Noah Beckham waits at the 10 let that sell over his head and in the Enzo kick was 15 the net is 31 drives a starter one touchdown soon Anthony Jennings has up next Iowa won the toss here this afternoon they deferred the option to the second half cell is she took the ball went down the field with all runs 70 70 yards 60 of those rushing yards coming from Jeremy hill 42 on the opening play there is Nelly shoos up seven Oh as they start their second drive from the 20 and his he'll back to the middle he'll pick up five yards James Marrs made the tackle inside John you talked about it earlier Morris kitchens Kirksey was threeball Conference linebackers for Iowa the heart so and he'd be big in his game today yeah Morris the four years starter he does a lot above the neck he's going to check in and out of defenses but one thing is certain Mike they better start to fend in the runner will get run right out of Tampa 10 plays 10 runs this is Hill his old man got pushed back at his way and he's going to lose a but doll Alexander the left guard got shoved back and impeded the progress of the running back hill that's Iowa defense right there it's effort to the football toss sweep to the left side and you're going to see four or five Iowa Hawkeyes converging on the ball carrier that's what you're used to seeing in Des Moines big third down for this Iowa defense I need to generate some confidence and they're in their sub package Reggie Spearman a freshman at the bottom of the screen they try to get as much speed on the field as they can on these third downs to track these athletic quarterbacks stars and his LSU offense are the receivers but it'll be Magee keeping and tonight the first down so 11 straight plays all runs and John louder note in the junior quarter on a Carrollton Ohio payment made the play and LSU is Green out experienced safety play has really helped the hot guys down the stretch they haven't given up big plays and Loudermilk has been a very good one on one tackler nice play an Aussie punks for LSU Jamie T the sophomore from Queensland he's gonna take it come on Tay Martin medley Galante's got it up to 22 an excellent punt returner whoops in space and down the sideline nice return by Martin man out to the 43 yard line 21 yard return means only 30 of net the first little boost to the day for the Hawkeye the 2014 Outback Bowl is brought to you by Outback Steakhouse no rules just right for go further and a flag official partner of the Heisman Trophy what damage can two football teams do in 90 minutes about 5,000 pounds of food at the team dinner sirloin steak two chicken two ribs baked potatoes salad of course coconut shrimp and bloomin onions after all the Outback Bowl two teams put away well over 5,000 pounds of food at the dinner that's a lot who's early of the week so the guys are able to work it off and get back great great week here in Tampa as always for the teams for the SEC in the big 10 second Drive Iowa starting 40 after the ninth punt return by Avante Martin manly there is Rudolph with time delivers incomplete he's trying to get to CJ Fedora wits the allbig ten time it I like Quon Alexander this outside linebacker at LSU played as a true freshman last year had some injuries has really solidified himself I think as the next great outside linebacker at LSU he can do a lot of things that time his coverage was outstanding Cu decent amount of empty no backs with the multiple tight ends that still spread you out of LSU brings a little pressure and on the sideline that's caught by Don Shumpert 50 caps for the senior from st. Louis it'll be third and five no doubt we have seen it we see it every Monday night there are two tigers all over the year after year the draft has seen so many gone last year was ridiculous the number of players drafted on the defensive side so finally attrition is said and this is not his superstar Layton LSU defensive cast that were used to not a young performers out there but that'll probably change in years so much third and five Rudolph is plussed steps in and throws copy the shy of the first down Ricki Jefferson made the tackle on the running back Damon Bullock and despite the good field position it will be three now for Iowa that's what john chavis the defensive coordinator loves to do get you behind in the down a distance and he goes to his six defensive backfield packaging blitzes it forces a ball to come out quick and right now Iowa's receivers are having a hard time separating from these LSU defenders but number to see if Conner warm Bradley do a better job of keeping it on the field of play he will shoot we're team punch down inside the 20 yard line for core breath the sophomore visit watch espn.com or download the watch ESPN app to watch ESPN live anytime anywhere brought to you by Vizio that's the before out back Chevrolet driven by Kevin Harvick who brought the point out for the coin toss here this afternoon with fans hanging through the rates a lot better than beating Iowa City right now otherwise he looks dead with moving up frontier with his drive starting at two looks like that may give LSU a little bit of breathing room Gregg Burt's offside defense number 71 made contact fiveyard penalty first down so John 11 plays 11 runs with the first time starting quarterback the freshman Jennings you've got some good receivers here who are just waiting for the ball to get up in the air everybody says hey is Jarvis Landry is he gonna come out is Odell Beckham jr. gonna come out in the NFL grant they're probably thinking about it right now they don't start seeing some passes I know how these receivers are they want to impact the game see that was him to be our 2 receiver listed 5 over 1 he's not going anywhere but we are Happy New Year Robert Flores in the studio with an update happy new year to you Mike it is to replay presented by surface on ESPN to Tommy Armstrong to Chrissy none luck there at the half that's the only touchdown of the half Nebraska leading Georgia 10 to 9 10 sec feel to the entirety of here this afternoon New Year's Day 2014 maybe a throw after a dozen runs here's the first girl the game over and with the fullback Copeland slipped out it's him Jeremy hill slipping and falling it almost became with the popup the air touchdown going the other way FRA it's a simple spread out to the right you're going to see he'll slip and fall luckily that ball wasn't intercepted by number 19 VJ VJ Lowrey off the ricochet and this is where these hot guy fans will get into the game a little bit in his backed up situation it would be huge for Iowa to get off the field to create some field position for their offense on third down let Bob search freshmen will go empty rushing through the throws complete for the first down and more Jarvis Landry across 220 221 yard line that's 14 first down yards for the junior that's a nice throw by Jennings just a stick route you're going to see just a quick out right here by number 80 Jarvis Landry catches the ball and he goes immediately North and South to get the first down he's a polished wide receiver I really like everything about him yesterday's he's got a little pro mindset to him Mike he's a polish young man I like him conversation here with four of the seven big 12 officials the first down was clearly gained over there after 21 play sidelined interference LSU I would assume that meant one of the officials trying to run up and down the sideline had somebody in the white we have David warden who is the assistant coordinator of big 12 officials also the replay coordinator for the big 12 amount was David Wood I assume by hearing that that was the call there there should be as the white area that you see the team bitch is for the officials to work the game and the team and coaches are supposed to be out of that white solid wider the first down was already gained so it remains first in ten doesn't become first in 20 after the penalty and Alfred blue with the rug gains a couple of yards per se we've seen burn famously NFL Films over the year years Johnny but get back coach usually it's a straight and conditioning guy very often college as well keep the paint clear for the official get back get back get back usually give you a warning that's a rule that's a little harsh early in a bowl game you make that call the senior Alfred blue remains the back and Jennings incomplete as the line of scrimmage but nobody close to over there and now the question in conversation will be was he within the tackle box there is no attention down then the ball went beyond the line of scrimmage Christian Kirksey makes an excellent plays gonna come off your right side he's on a blitz he contains the quarterback that's how you play and curtsey is an outside linebacker with strong safety type ability very athletic productive senior with his Hawkeye defense great fare for Jennings the freshman had no receiver on that sup watch these hot guys move around and try to confuse the young quarterback they're bringing Jenny's in trouble and brought down by James Morris so we talked about in our pregame they want to blitz this young quarterback stop the run get them in predictable passing situations and see what he knows about pass protection and blitz pickups here you see Morris on a blitz he's done it all season for Iowa if John the first putt from the Aussie key wasn't very good low hang time this is a terrific fun return seven through in the country in camonte a Martin Matlin the tiller rate get away from this one let it bounce down to the 38 yard line and that's where Iowa will take over of course we have big 10 sec here to start New Year's Day we have PAC 10 PAC 12 excuse me big team coming up with the Rose Bowl game right after us John when we talk to Kirk Ferentz yesterday if I made an interesting point to think about the teams that have represented the Big Ten in the Rose Bowl Wisconsin twice Michigan State since there was a championship those teams play football the way Iowa plays football line them up fullback good defense so they like the model they have right now in Iowa City I didn't do I like the way they play you're gonna see a lot of that in a Rose Bowl this afternoon from Stanford Michigan State north to south to back sets old school football is making a comeback Iowa trying to get its offense going here third drive and Rudolph the quarterback can take up and run you'll gain a couple of yards pull down by tomorrow and Rascoe the defensive end let's say a little bit about Rudolph the quarterback for the 15 year head coach to the hog guys South Florida Player of the Year in high school in 2010 and out of her good high school st. Thomas Aquinas they wanted all to district the region the state the mythical national championship not heavily recruited but eventually signing at Iowa he's hit and the pageant complete its Rascoe who made the great pressure and last play able to come up and get rudolph this time to plays in the row so the tuners from Shreveport when you run these bootlegs you are counting on the action of the fake to fool the backside defenders so far hasn't happened and this is not where rue doc wants to be behind into down a distance against LSU but they do have true true freshmen court quarterbacks starting in this Outback Bowl Shaun Robinson getting the start of Shayla Mills moves to save this pressure coming from Mills who's slipped and Rudolph's pass is incomplete trying to get it to to Vaughn smitten so it's another three now this Iowa offense has been unable to find anything to work here in the opening quarter this number 16 for Davis white true freshman he started all season long they really liked him he's from Shreveport Louisiana same town at Morris clay burns from the natural bump and run defender nice work by the LSU defense or grant funding for Iowa on the bounce Beckham gonna take it at the 20 and Odell Beckham jr. Lee a return of three to the 23 yard line check LSU's offensive here we go well they're pulling the right guard they're using the fullback that lead up on the inside linebacker and they're tossing a little cheese scheme and they're wearing Iowa out with this play right guards gonna pull and trap the strong safety the fullback leads up on the outside linebacker and it's a reverse pivot toss in so far Jeremy hill is thrash in Iowa with that scheme off the right side we'll see what adjustments Phil Parker the defensive coordinator of Iowa makes side they go 56 at right guard the sophomore Trey Turner secondteam allsec this season good on the move here is Jennings just a short little pass get it to the fullback kind of neighbors is upended by John Loudermilk little comfortable gain of five bujjamma we saw Jennings hop in there when Matt Berger got hurt trailing Arkansas late the game it was some kind of drive at the freshman put together a 99 yard gamewinning drive on that drive he had a good scramble for 21 yards they completed four passes including shrimp and Darrell's memorable 49yard touchdown to win the game against Arkansas the Friday after Thanksgiving reversing the hands up Beckham who will truck come out Beckham putting it in the air incomplete trying to get it to fellow wide receiver Jarvis Landry puts out let's go back here was that drive Jennings put together you start this up gives me my yes start with a bootleg he stopped back through a beautiful ball to his tight in at Dylan to get it started and then he found his deep ball accuracy a huge gamewinning spiral to travin dural and the legend began Mike but third five this is where LSU has been the best in the country on third down conversions let's see what the young man can do Iowa brings four out of his hands quit and Jennings finds Jarvis Landry for the first down catch 77 on the season for Jarvis save play that Landry caught earlier in the game the volume of offense is not what it was with Mettenberger at quarterback for obvious reasons it's down the run jeremyhill got the game going with a bang nice going with a long 42 yarder honor the opening play of the quarter that run is gonna here's 75 yards that bring this first quarter to an end now issues offense unable to get on track 14 plays whether I was on fence 14 plays in 22 yards LSU had the opening touchdown drive after one in tempo on New Year's Day 2014 LSU 7 Iowa nothing Mike Tirico Jon Gruden Lisa Salters back with you 2014 Outback Bowl the guys of Iowa City where the struggle here on the offensive end three drives three pumps to begin meantime LSU that very good opening drive led by the running of jeremy hill just capped off by a touchdown by the true freshman Anthony Jennings it's seven o LSU as we begin to the second quarter for Ellis have an interesting stretch here he got Jennings the quarterback of the future and a couple of our big high school players who are playing in one of the high school allstar games the Under Armour game over in Saint Pete here in a couple of days so they want to see they're going to get a big running back and wide receiver there talked about the future of LSU football perhaps taking shape at about 48 hours down it's at the st. Pete there is help to cut up the field and jeremyhill Baton Rouge takes it into Iowa territory however it's a marker down on the edge yellow holding here I think that LSU toss the ball on the perimeter these receivers have to sustain those blocks a long time I believe Landry got caught holy number 80 offense 10yard penalty second down John is you prepared for the game and watch Landry and Odell Beckham jr. the two thousand yard receivers what what do you see these guys who are thinking about going to the next level after this game I think they're more NFL ready than a lot of guys because of the offense they play in this is Camp Cameron who was the coordinator the Baltimore Ravens last year they're not running bubble screens and quick screens these guys are running double moved slot combinations audible so they're ahead of the learning curve love to see them all stay in school though yes mood messaging across the brief right from Beckham who taught BJ has is his night rated wide receiver at this point Alfred blue misses the Iowa defense all over that one led by the captain James Marrs to show you some of these catches Mike you asked about this number eight Jarvis Landry I mean Mettenberger put it up and he knew Landry would go get it but some of the catches he made were surface tension zero here's our del Beckham junior double moves they run a lot of different patterns and it's a vertical pass offense always has been with Cam Cameron calling the shots thirteen fourteen swinging the Blues got blocking downfield a beautiful play by Desmond King the freshman from Detroit came up Greenwich snuffed it out limited the game to 7/4 down here comes the punching through again to the tiger about Desmond game Mike just a true freshman out of Detroit he's got to bring down the big back Alfred blue in the open field what a play and what a year he's had not many kids and step into Big Ten play and go wire to wire as a starter at the corner position way by Keane Martin man we got out of the way that's a beautiful one we'll be down at the five so a 57yard punt no market at the eight first touch but a good job by the Aussie of course in the Outback Bowl Aflac I could see the duck duck was able to survive New Year's Eve Aflac trivia question since 73 3 FBS schools with two 15 year tenured head coaches let me give you one as my New Year's gift Iowa eight and fried 20 years preferences 15 season who are the other two coaches 15 years ni in the last two years this is the pity damage for once near Cleveland Rudolph with the pass on first down incomplete try to get to Matt van Berg Vanderburgh his freshman receiver name is white with the coverage sent a hello out to coach Frey hit fries out in Nevada watching his old school I want guys look fry Happy New Year it was a good healthy year for you of course Kirk Ferentz was on hate the fries staff and had some time in the National Football League in Cleveland before coming back here a good 15 year run it has been it's shot caught at the 31st out the Berlitz here's Robert Flores in the studio all right Mike Capital One Bowl on ABC South Carolina and Wisconsin Connor Shaw Bruce Ellington and right now they're tied at 7 early second quarter on ABC all right Robert Thank You Jordan cans eerie with the run here gave him a couple of yards after the 22 yard pickup by Fedora winds inside there Iowa trying everything no huddle up tempo no backs are trying every way they can to move this football against a young LSU defense a new doc does a lot himself with audibles I'd like to see this most quarterbacks I see in college football might look to the sideline for all the answers but not rude on plays can ziri again that ball seemed to come out it did come out 35 yard line what Alexander on the initial hit and no signal from the officials a pilot Azir he had fumbling problems early in the season and lost he came off the pile of the ball Les Miles wants to oversee progress was old on the field again third down it calls for progress so that pop out on the hips from Jordan Alan say hello Stan honestly Hollis who has the ball and get the ball the smiles and disbelief on the sidelines understandably so and we're not throws complete trying to keep going Jake doozy the sophomore tight end to midfield that's a disappointing result there as the whistle before progress blue as the first third down conversion for Iowa and do a nice job with doozy in these tight end formations little option rowdy can break inside or outside you see losted fell down a deuce T took advantage of it from midfield and Groudon trying to slant it for it goosey and it's incomplete one thing about these tight ends in Iowa particularly ducey he's a joker he's a tight end it can line up as a fullback on the line as a tight end as an HVAC and even as a slot receiver or wide receiver doozy is the tight end at ripped aisle or a ripped Ohio State might with over 130 yards receiving he's the fastest of the three Iowa tight ends mutes game that opens some folks eyes after loosing the Michigan State I went to the shoot in Columbus with the Buckeyes for a while lost by ten 34:24 pressure coming or not yet as he throws it was almost an interception for ASCO with Jalen Mills in that safety role has come in untouched multiple times coming off your left side untouched blue doc tries to buy time for the screen to develop and that Paul should have been intercepted by LSU third down and long and look at all the defensive backs then LSU is using in these obvious passing situations six of them and they're going to try to overload the protection and confuse room doc like had some time gonna take a shot down it's intercepted by today via zweite the freshman was step first step to the fastest hunk I receiver Damon Powell and he comes up with his second deleted interception well it was a threeman rush they fool Iowa they go in the maximum zone they go up the deep ballin there's that guy white outstanding play the 2014 Outback ball is brought to you by the Quicksilver card from capital one earned 1.5% cash back on every purchase and marathon fuelling the American spirit news here Tampa state Pete Clearwater get involved with beach day dry line LSU a couple of days ago says that the weather you tell me about all the time down here that's why I live here that's a great Beach a lot of fun you show up in a ring comes with you you played me after New Year to you as well LSU taking over at the seven is just the same as a punt that interceptions thrown by Rudolph and it's a couple of yards run for Jeremy hill but it could have been more well the mob Powell runs right by for Davis white at the bottom of the screen I think Rudolph's just got a step up in the pocket let it rip he under threw his speed burner on the outside and if you make a mistake inter davyous white will get it but rude ox got to pick up his play they're gonna have to throw the ball to win today they can't just rely on running the ball persistently and you can see that Johnny he just kind of flatfooted just stepped in through he had a chance to climb the pocket had some space for the first time a very good protection after Gaeta until again we'll get to the 13 yard line the jeremyhill is draft eligible he's sat out after his high school senior year LSU fans know the story the legal issue address there's a arrested as a carnal knowledge charts the Baton Rouge Police 2011 set out that season incident with a fellow stood outside the bar at April had curfew that had to deal with from what all the LSU folks has said despite the legal issues early on in his days free and at Baton Rouge he has been there the leadership the play deported himself over the last dozen months Terrance McGee is in it's 33 in that pass by Jennings is incomplete he tried to give it to Beckham in one more time the freshman Desmond King in coverage miss Desmond King has the look of a top flight corner it's going to be bump and run coverage any stairs it down and in transition Desmond King is all over the Hornung Award winner in coverage simple hits Ralph and I was off the field again on third down that's what LSU has done to opponents this year they dominated with their offense on third down so far today hasn't happened pressure on Keene another good kick it's mustbuy come on st. Martin medley and LSU has it at the 39 yard line James raced with the recovery and the top ten punt return men in the country Devante and Martin Manley trying to make a fake cat fair catch couldn't do it I don't know if he slipped or misjudged it but obviously the field of play is wreaking havoc on a lot of these returners and receivers whether he just misjudged that he's fading away from the ball and Miss LSU punt coverage number one in the nation this year you can see why they got a number of Tigers that can run in cover I've seen this a couple of times to LSU to the a the Aussie punter puts a little bit of an odd spent to slow spiral sometimes tough to catch problem there Martin man Terence Magee is stopped and King has put together a pretty good highlight reel in this first half well tonight BCS games contain a really biggest game Central Florida and Baylor those two schools have seen as they make their BCS debut I want to see Blake bortles now McShea Azzam behind his quarterback list one see what he does I've seen Bryce penny and I bail her out fence put up look like an odometer to score so Central Florida Baylor you'll see that tonight Sean McDonough Crisfield and Shannon spate out there in the desert they'll have it for you right here on ESPN after the Rose Bowl in prime time tonight Jennings taking a shot for Beckham income week with Jennings his quarterbacking was Mettenberger is injured this was Todd's top five quarterback list as you've seen on the bottom line the breaking news Teddy Bridgewater has said he is going will see portal's tonight Manziel was ridiculous last night he waiting for midnight in the ball the drop and you just watched Manziel derrick karr struggled his bowl game against SC and will have it laying around Mettenberger there are others to add to that list mister our Erin Murray also recovering from injury in Georgia but back to the game third and 12 in Iowa once again trying to confuse the young quarterback we're in for pressure up the middle Mars couldn't get there and that Jennings did surround a lot of scrimmage and completes it to Alfred blue for the first down again if you have any part of your body hovering over the line of scrimmage you're still okay that's a very good play and good awareness by a freshman quarterback knowing where to get rid of the football he takes one more step that's going to be beyond the line of scrimmage but Jennings breaks contain he's a threat to run and he does have the ability to throw the football in a 17 honestly run by Luke 86 Joe I thought Alfred blue was the best back at LSU he had a serious injury last year he's been granted another year medical hardship who knows if he'll come back but this is a talented bet that's the job I want if I come back in coach I want to be the running back coach and LSU you run into the left you'd leave me for that job think about it I mean if you had Alfred blue and Jeremy Hill you see Terrance McGee Hilliard standing down there he hasn't even got to come into the game yet and it's credit to LSU for using all these players and is a credit to the players for remaining unselfish that incredible atmosphere talent base of high school players in Louisiana treating this program so well just beggin for a shot against this oneonone coverage let's see if the freshman dials alone two just tossed a hill which shoulder down right into Carl Davis two first down on the run by Hill as we were watching warm up since off the hotel 6235 with that speed big punishing back there not kidding I didn't realize he was that big study at LSU tape all week and he's not running behind a bunch of munchkins now this is a big physical offensive line they're young players there's a chance they could all come back to Baton Rouge next fall including Hill off the muffed punt great opportunity here for LSU to extend the lead unless you touchdown that's the exact same play that the Wisconsin Badgers per Iowa with earlier in the season great study by the LSU coaches they saw a weakness in Iowa's scheme and they exploited it again right off the left side and Jeremy hill is making a statement today running the football 95 yards now for new of punk bike Avante Martin badly as LSU the good field position they cash in loc adds the extra point and LSU of the motif I like this running game right off the left side behind Lyle Collins you see the Titan bullet Jeremy Hill takes it the paper here's your friend thank you since 1973 our Aflac trivia answer we're throwing around a couple I want to throw an Oklahoma lute you want to throw out I'll take the Tennessee Volunteers all fired up I bet you want cheer to Tennessee yes she did and we need to get the Tennessee Volunteers back in the Outback for Butch Jones is doing a great job there I expect the Vols to be back he'll probably be there 15 years or more Barry Switzer and Bob Stoops and Oklahoma Johnny majors and Phillip Fulmer in Tennessee Barnes Fox our producers should be proud the two pro guys got your stinking Aflac trivia answer with no help so there Adam Jupiter came up with the question the crew the truck you Friday night guys the Monday night guys got you all right let's see what you got here Jordan cotton on a return these appended by Dion Jones sublime backer and this LSU teen little momentum dominating the line now they're picking up their play here watch this in real speed Mike Joppa Jones may Ellis who played six different linebackers maybe seven this year all these young players now have experience they just came off twelve practices here at great depth and competition and obviously a bright future here mark Weissman nearly a thousand yards rushing for Iowa this year has not gotten anything going here thus far and is only gonna gain two yards running to the left here twice but four carries 12 yards so far 938 yards on the season at a buffalo grove illinois looks like a fullback he wasn't full bath his injuries mounted he became the running back last year such a good job they kept him in that spot at a very productive season this year and here come the defensive backs for the LSU Tigers John Chavis continues to flood the field with fast perimeter players and I wouldn't be surprised if Iowa tries to run the football and one of these third medium situations this might be a little bit too long but Mississippi ran the ball against this light front of LSU but this might be out of the down of distance range this is 36 for Jay Gruden the sophomore quarterback oh we turn right into jail in Mills hands and Mills almost had a pick Murdock has not been sharp so far today 6 of 15 well it's going to be a square in by Devante Martin manly number 11 and Mills undercut him that's a poor route by Martin manly he's got to flatten that off if you fade out of the break that ball will be intercepted right now john chavis has all the answers for Iowa's office time for the hawkeye's bill Beckham juniors got into the 35 can he get to the edge no Beckham junior strung out well covered by turn of only five scattered Miller let the cover LSU in control Mills always games West while shook up sorry coach Happy New Year man should have that pick six for you today is Drive recap brought to you by Buick up at the two touchdown drives well the run on the ball like a lot of different ways it's a speed option you see Jennings option Christian curtsy he's got miles as the bitch back easy read touchdown then they ran a counter low they pulled the right guard they pulled it tight end and a load the edge with their fullback and it's a walk in touchdown for Jeremy miles that's the exact same way that I saw Wisconsin run repeatedly against Iowa you have to credit camp Cameron and this offensive coaching staff for taking advantage of their bye week preparation and LSU's defense is not given Iowa anything from the 40 over the top to the fullback Connor neighbors behind him an incomplete neighbor's caught five passes this year 52 yarders yet against Kent State in week through the season John Iowa or LSU opened for no then lost that game to Georgia that shootout when nobody could tackle anybody and that's when you start scratching your head about this LSU defense came back beat Mississippi State beat the quarterback challenge Gators with in the loss to Ole Miss that was the one that perhaps is the most disappointing for Les Miles team eschew well they have been a little bit inconsistent but if they win today it'll be four straight years they've won 10 or more games that's pretty good nowhere to go before Jenny's got out of it finds Peckham on the sidelines of they'll Peck about 3 yards shy of the first down is BJ Lowery voted in one of the off big ten corners made the tackle here comes the heavy artillery for you for LSU two tight ends 84 Logan Stokes 85 Dylan Gordon two tight ends two backs they continue to run the ball at one of these two tight ends away from where that overloaded hot guys are probably gonna run it down here Jennings on that Joss this one was red the energy of hill pushes it forward it's fourth and short at midfield you all know the pedigree of Les Miles always willing to take a fourth down with gamble the way his team run the ball he also knows on defense is pitch to shut up aren't to this point but I know he is thinking seriously about going for it I didn't think he liked that nickname the Mad Hatter either he didn't enjoy that brought up to him yesterday I told him I had a lot worse nicknames in that over my coaching career Jamie Keene is out see if they've got any tricks up their sleeve here leave love there the Keene hard to catch kick brought it into six by Martin Manley who has nowhere to go excellent coverage by Alfred blue all right let's get an update back in the studio here's Robert again Mike Steve Spurrier has a nickname but it's the head Ball Coach a lot of people think it's the old Ball Coach no no its head Ball Coach and the HBC dials this up Bruce Ellington to Connor Shaw and it works South Carolina of 13 to 7 on Wisconsin Capital One Bowl ABC hi Robert thank you give that game on ABC over on espn2 he's got a deal with Nebraska and Georgia in Jacksonville tax layer dotcom Gator Bowl so three choices of SEC big ten for you to sample here's the afternoon builds towards the Rose Bowl at 4:30 Eastern Time Brent Musburger Kirk Herbstreit standing by impassive dear j.crew doc from his own endzone trying to get something going in three yards of Damon Bullock eg a welter season long starter in the middle of this LSU defense one of these receivers for Iowa has to make a play they've got a lot of production from their tight ends but they need to get some pop from their wide outs in this passing game so far they've been invisible and LSU has dominated because of that only one pass to a wide receiver in this half that one deep shot to David Powell earlier that was intercepted Bullock on the run Oh field tackle to davyous white was he a freshman corner on each team King for Iowa whiten for LSU have good first half watch his left tackle Mike Brandon surely 68 hilt knocked you right into the turf he's athletic to pull on these perimeter tosses I think shirt is going to be the next great Iowa Hawkeye linemen gladness sees coming back for his senior year but this kid can do it all as a left tackle unfortunately guys foot back making clever there man as Iowa need a third down conversion Rudolph looking going down welter terrific drive for the junior addict Crowley Louisiana and it's another Iowa threeandout unless miles right out there to the official to get the clock stopped at two fifty three in his first half it worked by Les Miles managing the clock given his offense plenty of time LSU their first of the half please set the clock to 257 six possessions for three announce the work of welter for the punt in 30 seconds we have some high scoring offense is to say the least I avoid running Hudson's offense Braxton Miller and Ohio State Benson to discover Orange Bowl go through these PCs games it's two nights tonight Friday night 8:00 Eastern Time in South Florida Clemson Ohio State for kick out of bounds to the avail as you its best field position of the game as corn broth had to go off the side of his foot the Tigers going to take over the 36 after just a 27yard punt by Connor corn brass from Bridgeport West Virginia and you got to go back to Les Miles earlier in this quarter punting the ball on fourth and one pinning Iowa deep in their territory he knew his defense would get him the ball back and they have plenty of time to run the ball and call any play they want in their offense but so far I'm impressed with Jennings I'm really impressed with this game plan they haven't turned it over and they played smart to their sprints but was in to the win but it's not a stiff skip wind or of a breeze Hill up the sideline pushed out of bounds minimal game of about two for Jeremy Hill I expect Iowa to blitz and this is the area of the field they blitz everybody and play allout jailbreak zero coverage they have to get a stop here they realize if they give up a field goal or more this is a threepossession game I always got to make something happen right now with their defense or they're in trouble amantha field goal range already here's a run for hill cuts it up he's over a hundred yards now 102 with that carry it's the seventh time hills run 400 yards this year 11th on his career there comes the ameba package I call it the amoeba because I don't know what it is they bring in Spearman numbers 634 Nate Myer comes in 52 Alston they get as much speed on a field I'd be shocked if Phil Parker doesn't dial up some serious heat to try to make a play for his Hawkeye defense thirtysix they bring five Jenny's gonna make something happen one sideline incomplete the pressure was bearing down on by nate meyer sophomore taper iowa its fourth down you saw there on the edge of field goal range that the wind at their backs from here because shy of 50 yards gold lead oahu city freshman walkon kicker for LSU is made one from 49 against Georgia but they're gonna choose instead to bring out keen putt formation and if I'm Martin Manley the returner for Iowa I might get away from this ball if it's one of those awkward tough to handle kicks that's a great play it's where the ball is in college slipon that the man that's a terrific tip back by Murray Hamilton that'll pin this struggling Iowa offense inside the fog Happy New Year John Saunders will you have coming up here at half now happy New Year to you you got to get back to Ann Arbor for the classic back bear in the meantime in football Johnny Manziel if you saw it last night walked it again of course the Rose Bowl coming up later well break that one down and Teddy Bridgewater has decided he's going to turn professional talk about his chances their bike back to you and John and happy new year thank you to you mark may Lou Holtz to the studio pal the healthy 2014 to all of you miss Iowa offense limited to 73 yards on 28 first half plays three rocks from the five until Weissman loses two LS she was gonna take a timeout Anthony Johnson they call him the Freak and you can see why that's a man with freakish size and athletic ability as time he starts making more plays highlytouted highschool player I just haven't seen the production that I expected to see but that time he shoots out of a cannon disrupts his play and makes it that's what I want to see Mauro from the big man from New Orleans Jamar en Rascoe who's lining up next to Johnson rascal the defensive end at a Shreveport is injured on the play and the athletic training staff LSU out to look at his right leg and that'll look good for Shreveport and I put any weight on that already thin up front because of me ego Ferguson situation he's defensive tackle its Ferguson not on the trip for medical reasons that the school did not disclose and now Rascoe over to the bench cat2 Hamilton black and Rascoe looks like he got his leg but I don't know if roodaka is struggling with the wet football the conditions I don't know that these Hawkeye receivers are separating from these LSU corners but they have had no pass offense at all it looks like they're gonna run the ball again Rascar is replaced by Jordan Allen from West Monroe Louisiana and Weissman just hit hard Chilton's that's about the third time we've said his name he flashes like lightning across the formations that get that play they got a lot of guys who can run him LSU they do and the question John coming in was we're gonna see the motivation to fire LSU sights are set on the national championship game SEC championship game a BCS bowl and when you don't get their teams like this you wonder what are they gonna bring to the table in a game like this will they use it as a springboard will they use it to show how good they could have been if they will once that didn't really jump that may is Les Miles is 40 and 2 against teams outside the SEC and I've never heard of a stat quite like that but he's on his way to 41 into it that sums up his stay at LSU he's holding on to that one timeout LSU R as much clock back in 30 seconds Stadium is hosted two Super Bowls since both 35 Super Bowl 43 and it will host the college football playoff national championship game January of 2017 third and 10 three runs twice with E and LSU might take my back so is forward progress down in bounds Les Miles uses his final timeout with 27 seconds left as Rascoe is taken off to the LSU locker room for further evaluation in this 14 nothing onesided game and John when we talked about this game in the setup we talked about the scenarios Iowa could survive and could compete in this game when LSU's athletes have dominated this first half they certainly have and don't forget it was the botched punt return it really made this a to score game neither offense has done a lot today although you have to credit LSU for adjusting their style buying their freshman quarterback this is such an important game too for LSU for Les Miles and you can get some experience some comfort with Jennings going through a preparation for a game against the good defense as a starter that really changes the equation to be going into your offseason where there will be competition for that job but Jennings will certainly have a leg up look out for Beckham warm grass and kicked it trying to kick it away from Odell Beckham who grabs it on behalf of 41 he's taken down by two hot guys Travis Perry was the first one there 17 seconds no timeouts 42 and we talked about the transition from the pros to college and with the offensive coordinator for LSU cam Cameron one of the first things we talked about as we got to see cam a whole bunch doing our NFL games the first thing he said was and twominute drills in the end in college football no timeouts it's like a whole quarter it only first down stop the clock it's a very different world they got no timeouts here though Mike in they need to get some type of a completion a quick clock stoppage and a field goal try to give dela who sees a shot you see the green line again his field goal range here's a shot down the middle for travin dural incomplete it's a nice play by the young safety Tanner Miller recognized in the trips formation and turn in late to help on the deep ball and this is Hail Mary time I do believe for LSU and there's no doubt they have the men that can go down the field and get it Beckham is not out there for the moment it is Landry and doral Jarvis Landry has huge hands is jump volley to get up at 6 1 bring it in number 80 didn't seize the pressure and goes down set back in his own territory James Marsh the captain his pressure has been problematic brings this first half to an end I was defense did play a pretty good first half John I learned that opening drive this certainly did and I always got to find some offense at the break and find it quick we so salty thanks my coach down two touchdowns but I heard you tell your guys settle down keep playing you're playing well how would you assess that we're playing on defense I think playing pretty well their special teams have hurt us a little bit certainly we have to find a way to get something going offensively we have to be who we are so we get a little bit better job better execution they're playing stuff we have to find a couple ways to get some things open Kirk Ferentz is defense five three and out six seven LSU possessions at the break it's 14 nothing for the Tigers John Saunders mark may Lou Holtz happy new year guys back to the studio and back in Tampa at the 2014 Outback Bowl here on this New Year's Day four to nothing LSU leads to have time entertainment couple of thousand high school musicians dancers around the country from 18 different states here to entertain the crowd and to entertain you another great show at halftime of the Outback Bowl Jim McBain president/ceo this bowl over the years put together one of the finest bowls in the country one more time everyone here able to celebrate and enjoy New Year's 2014 get set now to the second half it's 14 nothing Iowa trailing LSU Mike Tirico Jon Gruden and Lisa Salters so we wondered if LSU would come out with that motivation what would be their Drive and they did they've played a good game but I thought we made the point before the half LSU's defense should not be or should not be discounted Iowa's defense got all the talk coming in but an LSU defense is not given any breathing room for the Iowa offense in that first half yeah I've seen this defense play great at times this year against Johnny football of Texas A&amp;M I saw beat Auburn and play extremely well on defense but Iowa is 1 for 9 on third down they've got 20 yards rushing and they've had no pass offense to speak of they've got to find something that they can do and get on the scoreboard make this a game Kirk Ferentz so Lisa before halftime you know we can't change we have to do what we do and let's run the ball effectively and they have been ineffective doing it in the first half speaking of Lisa go back down the sidelines Michael I just caught up with Les Miles coming out of the locker room and I asked him how his true freshman 19 year old quarterback is holding up he says I think he's doing really well he's not doing anything they're turning us I think he's really handling the situation well and that's important I asked him if they're gonna stick with mostly running the ball and he said hey look we want to throw the football we've got great receivers we miss them on a couple of opportunities out there but we definitely want to throw the ball but hey first thing is we want to win the game so we're gonna take the big give us like national champion of those seven Lisa national coach of the year 2011 Les Miles looking to get his sixth ball win here this afternoon perhaps the last half Hillel Odell Beckham jr. on the field no decision yet from the junior from Newman high school New Orleans if he will go pro after this say what's really been fun for me up here mike is watching his coverage teams if you like watching fast athletes watch these LSU Tigers cover a kitchen there James Wright 82 on special teams you made a great play to down the ball inside the five his wide receivers been an outstanding special teams player put its Uyghurs all season had a terrific play earlier in that first half James Hairston sets kicking off Iowa did win the toss to further option here to the second half to see if they can get anything going and they cannot an overturn the bridge to the 25 viewer just team in here is our marathon game track Jennings first start first career touchdown run interception and a muffed punt the mist is that month pump to keep his game LSU ashlar field jeremy hill taking it over 100 yards with his performer to the first half and now is the second best singleseason rushing yardage total in LSU history popped it in sophomore Jake Rudolph Weston Florida 50 miles across the state up to 25 mark White's middle running into the boundary on the right side will gain 4 to the 29 yard well jamario Rusco got hurt in the first half he's back on the field now for LSU number 59 at time Iowa ran right at him but it's good to see grass go back in the game he's one of the better pass rushers they have at LSU the way came off the field not putting any weight on his leg didn't think he'd be back this great news for ASCO and the Tigers we're not in trouble Jameel hunter bring him down third sack of the year for the some wolf from Katy Texas there's nowhere to throw the ball the protection was good enough you're gonna see on the left side of your screen Houston working against Brandon sure that's a coverage sack as much as it is anything mantoman coverage in right now LSU is dominating and receiving four of the haka not a team that made a lot of big games this year's very shy on explosive plays again today we're not third down toss is complete Jacob failure there's a big game this shy of midfield with a sophomore Hilliard 10th catch of the year I'm not sure what turday vias white is doing it looks like he's expecting help to the inside but there's nobody there just the simple under route and has not contested for an easy first Danner's of glumly coverage of 23 damon Bullock use the back Rena gives to Bullock left nowhere to go Gregg lost in safety with a loss of a couple of yards I mentioned earlier Rudolph a very smart young man this Iowa quarterback brewed up maybe a dog something microbiology premed major one point Greg Davis the offensive coordinator for this Iowa team said this guy takes courses I can't spell the name of and to move around some practices even because of some of the scheduling conflicts with the academic load Rudolph's taking in Iowa City down I see complete sinusoid on the back shoulder Shumpert lease has more on the quarterback yeah Mike I was asked asking you where not yesterday like what's the toughest part about handling juggling his academic schedule and football and he said just time management if I have to study for an hour I have to study for an hour and I can't cut it short there sometimes he says he's not able to watch Game film because he has to get ready for say an organic chemistry test school is always first written his mom's the second grade teachers dad's a lawyer he said if I don't make it to the next level I'd like to but that's okay but my dream is also to become a pediatrician and I'm fine this young man third and 11 is getting it hit as he throws here but it's completed Tellier again and this is the deepest penetration for the hot guys with afternoon first down at the LSU 37 what a great catch by Hillier working against the true freshman Robinson on the outside as another under rowdy catches the ball away from his body and that's a great throw by row doc because DJ welter hit him hard as he delivered at football backtoback third down conversions brew doc to Hillier Jordan Kenzie Rees the running back playaction shot time see unless you've got it covered sir udon takes off and I'll just get about two yards nothing opened up down field take a look at Hillier he's done some acrobatic flips on this possession after both catches he's gone down facefirst this is say don't ever leave your feet has a wide receiver for that reason right good nice plays by Hillier the two grabs against Northern Illinois and against Michigan big turning point win for the hot guys in their season beep the wolverines 2421 and then just put the pedal down against Nebraska scans Erie through the hole that time the kids here he gonna be closer to an Iowa first down 27 yard love like an oldfashioned fullback this Adam Cox watch him run right into the blitzing lost in the safety man off the right side leading the way for cans area off tackle this is an impressive drive by the hot guys using their tube accent little playaction passing now mark Weissman the captain is in thirtyone there's linebackers filling those gaps waiting to come in but Weissman breaks through first down there 21 that's just old school in a phone booth football I'm coming you're blocking who wins they call this power football at Iowa double feed kickout you're gonna see the backside guard ball but once again 38 Cox with the kickout and the big back highs Weisman I call him Weisman for a Heisman he's closing in on a thousand yards Mike big bad it was 17 hundred eighties career bestlooking Iowa offensive run of the afternoon there is why he's been on toss to get back to the line barely barely speed Anthony Johnson we see this are our typical week folks we go the NFL City for a Monday night game on Saturdays 8 the home team the Saturday afternoon we head back usually pop on a TV watch the SEC game and need to see that sideline to sideline speed like Johnson and about 30 other defensive tackles in the SEC well that's what coaches are looking for that's what general managers and scouts want to see Johnson do sideline the sidelines make some plays outside these hashes that was impressive second and long can cereal pick up the pressure to Tom and fedora wits the tight end open CJ fedora fedora wits number one red zone target on a corner route he's open this protection is outstanding he's got an eight bro second time through doc his mystic open Hawkeye receivers and it sets up a huge third and ten lifts converted three on this drive to to Jacob Hillier 17s going to be at the top new screen one's third and long curtain eleven they come well if you bring them all we're not got rid of it at all and caught by fedora wits with a good job defensively then just not the man down by Ricky Jefferson the backup safety see what Iowa will do fourth and about six he'll go top try to get on the board with a Mike Meyer allout blitz they force the ball to come out quickly and Jefferson holds his coverage gutsy call and it paid off for LSU Mike Myers showed up in Iowa City four years ago walkon from Dubuque he's now second to make 18 alltime in points in 35 wide right no good is not what Iowa needed bestlooking drive in a day get into the red zone but Meyer misses the short one off the right hands now was she ready to go move in our game long as we get towards the Rose Bowl here coming up next on ESPN first drive for LSU in this second half and Jeremy hill already over a hundred yards with a gain of three unless you try to complete a ten win season mentioned two years ago losing the national championship game this year third in the SEC West with the losses to Georgia omission Alabama second and seven to the first man Anthony Jennings taking a deep shot downfield Jarvis Landry couldn't haul it in great coverage again Tinsman King the freshman from Detroit this Desmond King has done it all today he's made tackles in the open field and here he's taking out one of the best receivers in college football Landry has a step on them but I call that playing the ball in the blind spot you hope your coverage you got to turn and find the ball late in the down in that time Desmond King does a great job a lot of savvy for a freshman we really popped off the tape John against Ohio State Michigan State two best teams in the league needed tackling on the edge and King provided third and seven Iowa brings the pressure Jennings throws sidelines for Beckham outstanding play Odell Beckham jr. Wow sorry for streaming but put that on a highlight reel it's showing double moves better go hard to do Wow great stuff all good 48 yard line after the game of 29 Jennings up top using these receivers now Landry tried to go his one hander couldn't bring it in and again King with him every step of the way speaking of bug good defensive backs Dennard outstanding DB for Michigan State we a lot of good defensive players on the field step for the Michigan State everybody starting to settle in there and Pasadena the Rose Bowl game for the 100th time it comes your way next here on ESPN Intendant jeremyhill to the left nowhere to go teams Mars is having a really good game for Iowa Jarvis Landry he's caught making catch he may want to get serviced all watch this final quarter back on board LSU had thrown to these receipts I mean you see I catch Beckham just made it's sick Jarvis Landry has made several of those this year these two cats have a lot of talent 13:10 iowa brings 417 coverage as Jennings throws two times intercepted back the other ways Loudermilk with space john Loudermilk inside 30 throw the ball get your receivers involved and you're not playing this to the strengths of your young quarterback you overthrow the tight end in the middle of the field and Loudermilk is just change this game watch number 41 to tighten on a square in pattern Travis Dixon balls clearly overthrown and that's a nice job of finishing a play look work there Captain James Morris comes from number 44 and the effort downfield blocking that's something they practice in Iowa finishing plays you intercept the pass you finish the play and he picked up about four key blocks have a review here John or an official review take a look at it as he came down the sideline did he stay inbounds Loudermilk here and looked all good there now the ball as he comes across the goal line see he got rid of the ball early we've seen that issue a couple of times even starting the NFL season very first game of the NFL season we had that Loudermilk has closed all of those look none of those looks are right down the line the ball is behind him this is almost like offensive where he's holding on to the ball and trying to see if he broke the plane david warden the assistant coordinator big 12 officials the replay coordinator for the big 12 in the Mountain West is up here in the booth with us and David one of the issues obviously it's not a look right down the line here on this play the angles play a real factor in the making decision on a play like this and then what does he actually lose possession firm control of the ball that's the other question the replay officials having to answer right now and does Jim Blackwood the head replay official have a definitive look at that one to uphold it or not Loudermilk in kensington Ohio and Carrollton high school hoping that he doesn't have one for the blooper reel on day 1 of 2014 then you have another issue on the back end of that I would imagine David because you need to see did somebody pick it up did you have a clear recovery what happened to the wall yes we got rid of it man that that all that plays a big factor in making a decision one did he lose the ball before he crossed the goal line and then what happened and we have to be able to see that on video so multiple things Jim Blackwood the head replay officials look mad John and it's fine way to start your year with a challenge and you remember that opening NFL game of the season we've seen it multiple times where players get to the goal line and they just start to celebrate don't hold on to the ball too or long enough okay David we've had three of these in the big 12 this year this year alone is this Charlotte yes so Dave let's say we don't have a look at where the ball went or if anybody picked the ball up what wouldn't have well here's the call we will last the second part of the question after further review after the interception and before scoring the Iowa player dropped the ball at the 1/2 yard line there was no immediate recovery therefore of the Iowa's ball first and goal from the half yard line it's less about to ask you in that situation the worstcase situation is if the ball goes out of bounds through the endzone here is where the ball landed take a look there in the endzone and then nobody went to pick it up now we saw Randall Cobb from the Green Bay Packers in the game against Chicago on Sunday the NFL game ball was laying there he picked it up ran in for a touchdown so if an Iowa player would have picked that up there it would have been a touch away in a touchdown that's correct but the ball was just left flying there no one picked it up and since the official signal touchdown and nobody picked it up it goes back to where the ball was lost well what would have been a lot remote pick six instead his first and goal from the one receive Iowa can punch it in and it's Weissman and he is stopped and men Loudermilk is sitting over there begging his offense to bail him out after the blooper though they try to run off their left side will strengthen this Iowa offensive line and penetration stalemates nothing lost a yard there from the two playaction pass looking for Fedora which the tight end unless you knows what we know fedora which is their red zone target and the defensive end Rascoe snuffed it out well the playaction pass didn't fool anybody it's mantoman coverage nobody peeked into the backfield and was fooled and if I'm Kirk Barrens I'm in fourdown territory I wouldn't hesitate to give it to my big back again and if I don't make it out go for about fourth down but this is why you have a two back to these situations it is Weissman looks to be a let's see you're running to take a peek or weissman ended up touchdown and this one counts is sure Mike they're very good go patent Loudermilk on the head said now you can take a breath I was a good run by Weissman he's been held under wraps most of the day but that's the biggest play in his Outback ball so far makes it a one score game Mike Meyer misty short field goals short time ago make it a sevenpoint game he's made 121 consecutive extra force Iowa back in it louder milk and take a breath exhale get back in the game the 2014 Outback Bowl is Ruchi by the only 2014 Chevy Silverado and dr. pepper always one of a kind of the Outback Bowl teams good to go visit play so you take the family every once in a while that's a great park you should try it mike milken since 1959 Zach Mettenberger the LSU quarterback who had his knee injured in that final quarter against Arkansas we talked to Zach we'll give you the background his medical condition the update coming up here as we go through the second half but very tough to watch for Zach here is Odell Beckham jr. digging down 23 Robert Flores who what do you have for us well Mike check out this play between Wisconsin and South Carolina Gamecocks going for it on fourth down Bruce Ellington juggling spitting able to convert later scored a little on a touchdown pass and they lead 20 to 17 on ABC that game over on ABC on espn2 Nebraska leads by five closing seconds for the taxpayer comm Gator Bowl as they're taking on Georgia three matchups of SEC pick ten they're all within one score here in the second half all building towards the Rose Bowl coming up next here on ESPN the 22 Alfred blue hit hard wouldn't go down gain of five James Morris was holding his life go back to Mettenberger the quarterback on the sideline for LSU he had one of the most prolific passing seasons in LSU history this year it's not easy to replace him and I'm eager to see what the young quarterback Jennings has inside of him now he just made a critical mistake are you rattled can you stand in there throw a couple strikes and find a way to win this game Mettenberger has been very helpful to Jennings and preparation here for the bowl game 75 that toss on a power play blue could be right the first down mark Lisa what to hear from Zach Mettenberger as he gets ready for surgery tomorrow on that baby that's right that's right my god Andrea curdle a month ago but he was telling us last night that they had to wait for the surgery because mcl off the bone and they wanted to really let that heal and start over first before going in and fixing the ACL that's for the timetable of one he'll be healthy he told us about four months should be ready to go in time for the NFL Draft I went in one mini can't start at least third and one for Jennings it's Hill to the right he's got the first down to the 38 yard line so another good power run of seven his Hill has a hundred and twelve yards here in the afternoon his feet never stopped that's what the good backs do they keep their feet alive in the hole they have vision and they finish behind their pads and those are the three things that this young back can do and I like the way he gains strength as the game unfolds like to see him really be a force down the stretcher at 184 yards against Auburn after 57 against Mississippi State adding to his total here got out of the lowest Rinka passat arm tackle and games about 7 or welcome to those of you who watched the game in Jacksonville as Nebraska gets one on the board for the big ten as Nebraska beat Georgia Georgia team in very similar position as LSU they lost their senior quarterback Aaron Murray kid from right here in Tampa we had this game a couple of years ago if you're just tuning in LSU dominated the first half 14 to nothing lead Iowa's offense couldn't get anything going had a good Drive missed the field goal start the third but a long interception return led to the touchdown it in a one score game and now the Iowa defense after Hill games a yards gonna face third and shortened and you can see why LSU is such a dominant offense when it comes to third down Mike almost 60% they converted and I reiterate that because it is an uncommon statistic but a lot of these third downs are three or less that's advantage offense especially with a quarterback like Jennings who's a threat to run it as well as throw it nine for fifteen today with a true freshman at quarterback it's impressive it's the play clock often time it'll be play action and the throws complete and the first down to Connor neighbors the fullback got through the contact with Desmond King this drive stays alive late third quarter that's what happens you bang the ball off the left side behind while Collins repeatedly then you throw a playaction pass you slip the full back into the flat to get another first down good play calling by Cam Cameron LSU from midfield toss to the right big hit on Terrence Magee Robert Flores back in the studio have that Nebraska game end up well here's how it ended up Georgia going for it on fourth down Hutson Mason Arthur Lynch who can't hang on and Nebraska holding off Georgia on the tax layer comm Gator Bowl 24:19 hunter the Nebraska's seasons job very embarrassing home loss Thanksgiving Friday to this Iowa team 38 to 17 two teams that desperate for a window postseason momentum in that one contact by louis Treecko behind a lot of skirt I like trinket Posada like his name I've been saying it all week his penetration he disrupts the blocking scheme and you're gonna see number 44 clean up on it put trinket Passat penetrate and James my number 44 linebacker he's done an excellent job today James Morris the team captain of the Iowa Hawkeyes third and 10 see what Jennings does last the throw to the middle of the field was picked off we will the pocket right if you see the pressure by Dominic Elvis Dominic Galvez is healthy again he's had some injury problems he's back in the lineup today it's a threeman rush you're going to see all the 79 just continue to push the pocket and hit coach Kirk Ferentz likes what he sees from his hot guys in the second half I don't know what he said but whatever it was it worked closing seconds third quarter to get away punt does not hit cleanly and he out of bounds 23 yard line on the kick by key nine seconds left third quarter Iowa offense that had only 73 yards and halftime has come up with about 60 here in this third quarter and the big interception by Loudermilk to give them a chance now down seven with the ball into the quarter j.crew doc hit as he throws that pass is incomplete Iowa fans looking for a flag with Don Shumpert doesn't earn one riki Jefferson with an excellent read drove on the ball almost got there for the interception saw that hit the roux doc took it to stung him to say the least three seconds left CJ Beathard is the backup quarterback he's a redshirt freshman grandson of NFL general manager Bobby Ben 30 with a couple of Super Bowl champions in Washington many playoff teams Bobby Veterans built cj's the backup brew doc limping significantly as he brings it to Weissman and the quarter comes to an end and the athletic training staff for Iowa sees that they're gonna take a peek at the quarterback as he limps over at the end of this third quarter back to the fourth quarter Mike Tirico John Gurdon Lisa Salters Lisa's good check on Jake aruku has been bothered by knee problems the Wisconsin game the Nebraska game this year so the clean hit two plays ago and it was in that Wisconsin game Rudolph had to come out and CJ Beathard came in and been third the redshirt freshman from Franklin Tennessee has to enter here in the fourth quarter he does so on 3rd and 8th the LS she welcomes him with pressure and better throws and the receiver slipped come on Sam Martin manly on the cut it's incomplete and it's fourth down that's a shame I think Manley is gonna have a chance to play that ball he slipped earlier in the game fielding a punt that time he went down running to the corner and the ball falls incomplete Iowa's got to be careful with Beckham in this situation he's a dangerous return man to Mike no Becca me jr. said for the punch from Connor corn

starting at much the way 2013 ended dealing with a little bit of discomfort the injury that not the amount of two games including the Nebraska game their last game as he gets on the bike John we have to watch his LSU offense to see if they can get back after a poor third quarter then a bit more with the true freshman Anthony Jennings Jennings pressure and neutrons have thrown down by Christian Kirksey the senior captain from st. Louis not try to tell you these three linebackers are really something in Iowa hitches Morris and Kirk see lots of fitnesses play keeps contain he pushes neighbors out of the way it hangs on for dear life and that's a huge sack for this Iowa defense what a play by Kirk see mister seven children first eric says talented he's had a long time it's the entire group to Morris Hitchens as well you see all three of them they've been in the play throughout the day play clock at three as Jennings hands up the middle his Jeremy Hill only need three in his Iowa defense and the Iowa fans that's how they win games here Mike their defense sets the tone they hang around they just won't go away and it starts with these three linebackers fortyfour Morris sucks the ballcarrier and Hitchens cleans up and here comes that sub package as fast as Iowa can get with this group they have on the field right now they want to take care of Jennings if he scrambles let's see if they blitz or play it conservative but they will disguise it look at these hot guys hovering around Sue's way Kim Cameron goes will he be safe be conservative with his freshman quarterback overload to the quarterback some rights Jennings got protected and his pass is incomplete on the sidelines Beckham came up with the ball the official said he didn't have it alive jugs had to look in that's a three and out with good field position for this Iowa Demuth's Desmond Kant continues to make plays Mike I've seen him cover Landry that time it was Beckham disappointing drive that time by LSU they had a chance to close the door and doesn't look like roodaka be back Mike disappointing for this soft warm from Weston Florida starting quarterback Jamie Keene kicks a tough ball to catch Iowa got close to him that time gonna let it bounce it hits the facemask of an LSU player as it was initially touched but no control so it's touch back and despite Jalen Collins trying to pull it in it'll come to the 20 crew not done for the moment it's in the hands of the backup quarterback Beathard backup quarterback CJ Beathard the redshirt freshman from Franklin Tennessee dad Casey's a songwriter now his son here on New Year's Day is the Iowa quarterback seize the Flitz coming off his right side let's see what plague we got the burner time out here as you tried to adjust it and it'll take the time out step out quickly here hoping

One earn 1.5% cash back on every purchase New Year's Eve parade Ybor City votes marching bands high schools colleges lots of local folks one of the great time the Outback Paul has become 28 playing in this game 19th year that folks it out back to the title sponsor great title sponsor shortened Ken's here is the back Beathard gives to him and their gums can 0 13 first down the yards to the 33 that's his Kirk Baron's offense it's zone blocking at the point of attack and creative blocking on the backside that time they slid the fullback across the formation nice work up front nearly doubled the longest run of the day for Iowa they had a 7 yard run by Weissman earlier for time 10 series nice play by jamario ASCO we saw injured in the first half he comes back after the game 21 speaking of injuries John Jalen Mills they work on the left arm that it's starting safety today music plays corner with an aided it before helped back to that safety spot Mills came back during the timeout safety has been an evolving door in LSU this year Mills play corner all year they converted into safety because of the injuries and now he's hurt ix Beathard the tight end Jake doozy Newsies got a first down at the 42 yard let's see that mark is it maybe a little bit shy of it as they mark it looking it's going to be third and short we remind you that tomorrow night the Bowl Championship Series continues from the Allstate Sugar Bowl Oklahoma and their struggles in BCS games three and six under Bob Stoops take about Alabama of the three of the country tomorrow on ESPN Beathard with the sneak and the keep but we had whistles first from the head linesman and the line judge that LSU bench defensive team was not given an opportunity to match up will replay the down the island side burns very disappointed did they suck that's a question you get time to match subs if you suck and the Iowa sideline furious I'm sure they're saying we didn't suck we didn't change personnel I don't blame Kirk Ferentz at all that is a terrible call keeping anyway and that's stacked up now what happened there was that the third down play run see the officials running in to mark the ball you're gonna mark it right at the spot and we didn't hear a whistle and now get a measurement and that looks to be short you had to get even gonna count Mike still third down on the marker we're going to come down remember we had one of the worst measurements in the history of the sport last year here South Carolina Michigan when they awarded a first happeneth no no no let's see that no it should be fourth down he pointed the wrong way to be fourth down yeah it's up first down LSU its fourth down now so that last play counted the referee forgot that that last play that was run was whistled dead and it's going to be fourth and one now let's see her Kirk Ferentz does here this is one of the strangest short yardage situations mangabeys Kirk Ferentz his lips John sorry yeah I want to go back to the play before you have to give the opponent a chance to substitute only if you substitute and Iowa feels and there were six coaches in their sideline who lost their head because they were sure that they didn't sup and I know the offensive team is going to know if they suck they're not bringing David worden our sister coordinated Victoria fischels up here in the booth David and I'm right on that rule yes if substitutions by the offense defense is given time to match up a reviewable situation note take it in so on fourth and one it will be a punt and Beckham is going to let it go and I will kills it back inside the pot in county marker down back in the line of scrimmage remember is fourth and one we have a penalty thrown by the head linesman on the LSU bench side at the line of scrimmage now are they counting players here meantime the injured quarterback for Iowa brew doc is coming back on the field what do we have illegal substitution on the deep end these players would decide this game illegal substitution all right so here's the illegal substitution there it's the departure at the top it's the first down as I said last year right around this time this rule out comes back around the clowny play South Carolina deserves to have it and they do Iowa deserves to have it and they do because I think they got jobs on that substitution deal from the 47 just double pass not a trick play and it's thrown by Manley Martin medley and it's broken up on a terrific play coming over but lost in the safety the Iowa fans want a flag on it great recovery by lost in Bullock peels out of the backfield and let's see for yourself if this is a legal hit looks like all shoulder to me but it is vicious about the timing for pass interference almost simultaneous back up roodaka the starter who knock continues to warm up on the sidelines the backup Beathard stays in what's going to happen on this life that fit throws it's caught by the tight end two yard shy of the first down is CJ Fedora wits with 1048 left in this fourth quarter all starts with blitz picked up Jordan cans Erie the backup running back picks up a safety blitz LSU blue another coverage again that time Mike number 87 Jake Busey was wide open on the crossing route and they've gone back to the big back I'd be surprised if it's not Weissman off the right side more than two where he goes to the right side LSU was ready for it Lamine Barrow and Lofton Mike excuse me Vance slope the team captain at right tackle they run right behind him in critical short yardage situations and Barrow stops it injured LSU play we've lost him who went low along with Barrow and lost and shaken up the senior from Texas who's going to play in the senior ball getting medical attention it would be fourth down and about three for Iowa here with 1006 to go Wilson's a big loss he's started 23 games for him he's really been a factor near the line of scrimmage today for the training staff will continue their evaluation will step out on this corner that one of the LSU safeties has come off the field with injury Craig Austin we mentioned all SCC looking at his shoulder big punt by Iowa on fourth and three Weissman the mark is going to be short at the 44 they needed to get just to the front of the 43 they're going to measure but I think that mark is gonna come up about a foot short well Weissman snuck in as the up back on the punt team and there's no question this is short and they're gonna bring out the chains anyway you see the unofficial yellow line good LSU's offense will have it here is Kirk Ferentz and often less miles play sheet a little trickery in the punt game on 4th and 3 and well well short so LSU will take over and it's been an outstanding game by Anthony Johnson the junior out of Walter high school in the world particularly the fake they're just going to snap it to the up back and he's going to power off the right side you see 37 Loudermilk will to kick out block and you have to credit LSU number 58 Taj Jones next starting linebacker contributing a huge play a special team for LSU Jones injured his hamstring lost his starting job Quan Alexander stepped in but Jones the senior comes up with a big stop so now the freshman Anthony Jennings gets it back to Hill on the edge only a couple of yards there we remind you these BCS games start with the Rose Bowl next on ESPN continues Friday with Clemson Tajh Boyd and Braxton Miller's high powered Ohio State offense will be in the South Florida night time 8:00 Eastern with a discover Ahrens Bowl Friday night on ESPN Tostitos Fiesta Bowl tonight UCF and Baylor make their BCS debuts and of course Michigan State Stanford coming up to the Rose Bowl next second and eight hill to the right bring up 36:35 big partner this watch his team captain middle linebacker number 44 James Morris he's going to diagnose the formation here they come with the ameba package the subbing Iowa hot guys get their speed group on the field but Morris will alert him what's tough to run he'll give him a couple key reminder sis this young man is really suffering 35 for Jennings Iowa brings three Jennings has time now is flush looking downfield and then it is incomplete trottin landry along the sideline late that time Iowa John they dropped eight in coverage and there was nowhere for Jennings to go then what's that package they continue to use an obvious passing situations they bring people they drop people you don't know who's what that time you're right it's a threeman rush it's a stunt you have all day to throw and nobody open and it's a second time tell us you asked wanted good field position flag down here for illegal procedure I believe on LSU push them back five ball start number 82 offense fiveyard penalty for that James right away that very good special teams play in the first half seniors exceeded everyone's expectations with what he's been able to do on teams take a look Andrew doc he's working with the trainer down there trying to fight himself back into this game I wouldn't be surprised if you see him one more time Mike in kicking into the wind Martin Manley lets it go and it just goes over the goal line great hustle with LSU unable to pull it in see through doc tries to work out that neat at the top of the hour here means we're just a half hour away from sending you to Pasadena Rose Bowl pregame and then kickoff coming up with Stanford at Michigan State as the Bowl Championship Series the final act to the BCS begins CJ Beathard still in a quarterback the backup for the injured rIDOT iowa taking over in its own 20yard line and cans Erie to the left at least 13 yard run to start the last drive this one a gain of four good to see Craig lost and back in the game for LSU number six he went out earlier and he's been a big part of this LSU defense today they need him to finish in Jalen Mills playing with safety spots a third second and six cans eerie again the are on the first down as we approach the halfway point of this fourth quarter and we are with you the rest of the way without commercial interruption as we find the winner of this twenty first meeting between the SEC in the Big Ten the Outback Bowl at SEC twelve Big Ten eight short yardage situations have been difficult for Iowa today me we're stuff the last time around they ran the ball off the right side let's see if they run behind her all big ten left tackle this time Weissman is the back it's a fake to him then third we'll keep it first out of more at the 40yard line CJ Beathard with the run good call motion a fullback across and he has slide him into the flat and on a bootleg Beathard thinks the toss he's got the fullback open but he does the smart thing keep the ball get the first down yourself LSU lucky that play wasn't called on number 52 Kendall Beckwith near the sideline big first down inside a 7 from the 40 better why don't they take to see the tightend turns into the 25 pickup of 35 hot guys on the moon st. play scored on against Ohio State where he went 80 yards he is Fedora wits working together on the short side of the field and no one cover them Iowa jumps the bomb they'll run another play quick with Weisman to the right 7 into the red zone you wonder how much gas is left in Anthony Johnson's tank he's down now on one knee I hope he's not hurt but without ego Ferguson and now with Johnson down LSU has depleted at defensive tackle and I think Iowa knows it Iowa fans don't think that Johnson is injured as they started booing but he can never be sure player safety involved always want to see a guy if he's feeling any discomfort take a moment that Iowa offensive line cheering their fans on in the back to encouraging them to be excited about their play I'll take it take a look at number 90 bouncing he's trailing the play could be a cramp that's what it usually is Mike well they checked Johnson let's check in with Robert Flores for an update all right Mike right now in the Capital One Bowl on ABC Wisconsin and South Carolina Wisconsin's Ken zeldo 91 yards longest kickoff return at Wisconsin Bowl history ken zeldo so much determination dough however South Carolina answers Connor Shaw they reviewed it but ruled a touchdown Gamecocks up 34 24 late fourth quarter on ABC thank you as you look at Johnson slowly walking off big 10 looking for Bowl victories Serkis beat Minnesota Kansas State beat Michigan earlier today in Nebraska got the first win the conference up in Jacksonville but Johnson makes his way off slowly John mention ego Ferguson others starting defensive tackle not here medical reasons so official aperture Quentin Thomas on that inside see if Iowa runs him saw mantoman up top I'm sure that there is depth it's gonna get the Wiesmann by the back of the minnow I spend gonna be stopped just shy of first down good straight by DJ welter and jaylen Mills big stop third quarterback sneak on a quick count here they're trying to rush this before LSU can get set this up quickly it's better running to the left side and that Martin is shorter than 15 so that time Ellen she didn't try to sub got their subs in Iowa did not exchange players and the power behind Sheriff the first team allbig ten left tackle didn't gain much another LSU players down the main bearer well we've seen jaylen Mills go down and come back I've seen lost in their safety go down and come back it looks like Johnson's going to be able to come back and now it's Barrow but remember LSU has not played very many Tigers in this game but I'm more interested in the spot now Mike did better to pick up that first down did not look like he did the left foot of the headlines with his short of the 15 which is the first down mark I can look at Barrow number 18 jumping so he got hit in the head gear fifth year senior really a great story at LSU and he's wearing that number for a good reason Mike yeah number 18 we go back to Matt Mauck the championship team quarterback you get success on the field and off the field show your selflessness like mocked in then passed it on to jacob hester and based on your character you overcome adversity you wear that Jersey and Barrow told us yesterday the great pride he has and wearing it here the Iowa fans booing earlier but you can tell by that replay the way he got hit that's why I always have to be careful you can't just assume teams are faking injuries oftentimes in those piles contact like that whether they were going down on purpose to slow the tempo earlier or not that will look legit good to see barrel up and okay let's see what Kirk Ferentz is going to do on fourth and a half yard well he ran a bootleg the last time I've seen quarterback sneaks number 45 Weissman his heavy gun is back at tailback he was stuffed earlier biggest call of the game right here for Iowa go for it up for the one and the food again it's better rolling and throwing yeah it's intercepted by Lofton Lawson's got a lot of room button digs down the sidelines not kind of balance of the 32 flags down on the return counter fulfilling one of the guards for Iowa shaken up on the rhetoric there's going to be a clip against LSU but the Bengal tigers made that perfectly personal foul block below the waist LSU can even be enforced half the distance for the goal first down here's the pick by lost in third of the year seventh of the season Dione Jones was chasing Beth Lee he chased them down and there's Lawson who was injured earlier in the game making an outstanding interception there's the black below the waist by Jalen Mills and now it's up to the Iowa defense to get their obsessed one more chance and how conservative getting LSU be in this field position with their young quarterback since the interception by Loudermilk we have not seen Jenny do much throwing the ball at all this career start those of you just joining us for Anthony Jennings he played only 42 snaps before today Jeremy Hill led a big run on the first play of the game that set up a run only touchdown drive takes it to the 10 under five minutes Iowa can stop at twice Berger Zach Mettenberger has really gone out of his way to help Jennings throughout these bold practices I really complement him postponing that surgery say what you want he wanted to be a part of his final game as an LSU Tiger going down leading his team anyway he can't I credit him that for that second and eight here the big first step that more jeremyhill ins in the 38yard law hiccup in 28 it's what the green packs do Mike they get stronger as the game goes on pick and choose runner at timepiece sees his pullback neighbors block and he reacts suddenly to the outside and you see that burst of speed that not many 235 mouths backs have nice job of blocking up front by the LSU line and really good no sound brother in John Hill's up to 159 second best of the year record to this bowl game Terrell Fletcher in Wisconsin at 241 bag of the 95 outside and as you things within their presence be known and so is held again into the secondary says like the opening drive League a hill with a gain of 20 after 20 and a play before and now he's coming off the field he's he sees his coaches point to get back in there but he's running hot right off the right side you see neighbors again with a great block against kitchens and he can make you miss he's got elusiveness to make you miss in oneonone situations and he is a powerful back he's just catching his breath of the sideline was two runs of 48 yards 28:20 taking Hill up to 179 Terrance begin the new tailback is totally different guy two running right sidelines treating everybody well couple yards there Kirk ferns very close to that window we're gonna have to use this timeout she only has two walking coaches we'll wait till that second third down they give team third and long I may help you out tumbling clock will be under two and a half of the next one both of these tight ends Dylan Gordon 8584 Logan Stokes have done a nice job blocking today and all Jenny's does is pick a side away from the down safety and run the ball job by Jennings milking every second of the clock turn it right back to the geek see if I will take that time out here they do at t12 before third downs no score in game 147 well of course we build towards Monday night and Jameis Winston the Heisman winner against trade Mason Auburn see what LSU defeated the Vizio BCS National Championship game Monday January 6 on ESPN for a variety of different options of coverage for you on the family Network stop Blackledge and I will be out passing you call on ESPN radio via a tremendous game that magical Auburn season other than their game against LSU great to see if they can close it out against that highpowered Florida it's out that both those teams are gonna be quick so you guys gonna have to be quick with your broadcast here we got the one of your best jobs ever Mike okay well I won't be saddled with you alright you know we've come here's our fourth year now this ballgame think about we saw Joe Paterno for Penn State go up against Florida and Urban Meyer's fair well then we have a tremendous triple overtime Michigan State Georgia game Kirk Cousins and those seniors finally got a bowl win Michigan State's could tell you another Bowl win against Stanford next here on ESPN at the Rose Bowl and then last year we had that clowny hit one of the plates of the year on the first day of the year and a wild finish with Michigan South Carolina and yet again those tight Outback Bowl coming down to the final minutes well do you hand the ball to Jeremy Mills one more time or do you let your young quarterback at one shot with Beckham jr. at the bottom of the screen Jared and six they will run it in his Hill to the right big first down into the 20 into the tank the MVP is in the end zone for LSU touchdown Tigers that's a big time run by Jeremy ill patients touchdown LSU goes off to the side pine he gets a couple plays that catch his breath he comes back into the lineup and he wins the Outback Bowl for LSU what a performance by jeremyhill 216 yards it's been 9 plus years since an LSU Tigers have that in the game Alli Broussard at 250 against Ole Miss back to Saturday before Thanksgiving in 2004 but jeremyhill the sophomore from Baton Rouge first team running back in the conference this year taking it close to 1400 yards for the season extra point at it what a drive that was when they needed it on the ground in a lot of Hill double team you pull a backside guard jeremy hill with a stiff arm he shows it alright Bishan patience speed and elusiveness and I love the stamina miles is 41 and 2 against teams from outside the SCC that's 95 wins in nine years and if they could just keep this group together will contend for all of it next year Mikey well your Capital One player in the game he'll goes over 1,400 yards for the season 1401 with his rushing total today the careerhigh 216 and John like you said guys who'd get better as a game goes on to close that drive he had three rushes of 20 yards or more starting on the right side and that last one he made three guys miss and that's the same play I talked about earlier Mike that's the play that was kotzen hurt Iowa with earlier in the season and twice Jeremy mill scored on that play it's a credit to the preparation of LSU and these players ability to put something new in and execute it at a high level and it helps when you have a great back at 216 total is seventh alltime and LSU history upon Charles Alexander in 1977 so down 14 Iowa desperate need of a big play and Georgia cotton trying to get what Oh 20 never been to the five but the huh guys are still alive that's no quitter these hot guys what an effort 96 on the return and I think that right foot just hit the paint yep yes some really good blocking down the field and I was going to have to score quickly here obviously and with the ball on the right hash and number 22 in a game I expect Daymond Powell to see the ball creatively in some way shape some shape or form he is a guy that they like to throw quick squeeze to bubble screens you name it here he is at the top of the screen will CJ Beathard in after the longest kickoff return out back ball history can Iowa make it six that third hand as he threw if T head came through that's a live ball and LS she was on it Tigers recover first time Alakazam re and Rascoe the hits and what you promised rascal on a stunt we'll get a replay to see if it is incomplete that's what keep Kirk Ferentz is hoping see Roscoe 59 a couple of different things there it was it a forward pass let's talk it through with our expert here Damon warden the assistant coordinator big 12 officials David as replay is watching this what are the things they're identifying here well they're trying to determine if he had control of the ball and when it was lost and if it was lost before the pass started and that's his hand arm going forward and does he have control when that hat when the ball comes out so you're looking we sometimes call it refer to these types of things as empty hands meaning his hand doesn't have control of the ball the hand comes forward but in reality it's empty even maybe even if the ball is touching it slightly there's no control once he gets bumped off that hand there's some space there then in essence that hand becomes half empty that's correct I think it's a fumble Mike and you have to really credit the front four of LSU a lot of these men have played almost every snap down the stretch and Rascoe saves his best for last replay official has made the determination upstairs a Greg Burke's will tell us why this was a review it was an incomplete pass 1:46 telling the clock that's a shocking overturn there but it gives Iowa life and again Fedora wits 86 six red zone touchdowns the big tight end and it'll be a check with me I know they want to throw a quick screen to the top of the screen into my pal if the numbers present themselves the backup quarterback better into the engine Rudolph watching going to the corner it's cut from the touchdown by come on st. Martin manly so the overturned on the incomplete pass bumble ball gives Iowa life and the Hawkeye still in it who would 142 to go what a beautiful throw five left third in just a simple corner round I think Kibaki Martin manly wins they beat the shrimp freshmen Rashard Robinson Mike Meyer to add the extra point negative seven point game Mike Meyer 122 in a row 2114 so 96 yards on the kickoff return remember that other Iowa touchdown set up by the 71 yard interception return in the first half nice throwing a tight window by Beth erdan Vivante Martin manly the leading receiver for Iowa makes the play and about that reaction we Jordan cotton the man who brought the kickoff back that Outback Bowl record 96 yards and now here we are to talk hands team an onside kick at 142 left that's an obvious onside kick situation you see both special teams coaches talking strategy I'd be surprised if LSU doesn't use a timeout after they read the deployment of the Hawkeye's onside kick team it'll be a check with me on sidekick he'll count the numbers here he'll count him at the top he could even kick it in the middle of the field and recovered himself would I be surprised at fellas you might even take a timeout to make sure they like what they have many years remember I will have this situation against Florida in this game you have Beckham and Landry the receivers who are waiting the hands guys on this side here's the bounce Senate spot as it was a slip by Connor neighbors for fullback and his heart had a skip of beat as he lost his footing but the ball didn't take that skip up a neighbor's able to secure the minute 42 with only one Iowa timeout left probably not as simple as taking three knees but just a couple of seconds need to be run off by Iowa on a player to to close this one out that's what you do you put your most reliable player Jarvis Landry deep behind the quarterback just in case there's a bad snap clearly Les Miles is gonna take a knee you can take knees you'd be close to fine here timewise as the clock stops the timeout of 139 clock keeps running the guy who took their time out there pointing up the clock perhaps they didn't take your time out there Kirk Ferentz staying in three Iowa coaches pointing over to the clock on the right and needless to say LSU will get to ten and three and Iowa will close its season at 85 assuming nothing crazy happens that's what they had to do they need to kill a couple of seconds timewise so now Kirk Ferentz will take the time out they need to burn you couldn't just take four quick knees and then the game when they have one timeout left with three quick please excuse me it's need to burn a few seconds and now they should be in a good spot with no timeouts left like the direction the Iowa program is going John after the hiccup of last year four and eight eight wins the big ten is not at the zenith of its success or strong programs so it's a good opportunity for Iowa perhaps to make another run in the conference over the next couple of years if they can build off of this year I think so they're gonna lose three seniors on offense they will have to replace those three linebackers and that'll be hard to do Kirk Behrens excellent coach I'm sure he has a plan B carefully don't take a penalty here that would stop the clock on you and in any way shape or form going to get less miles the Gatorade I just make sure the game ends properly again as I was telling you timewise LS she needs to let a few seconds run off because they couldn't just run it out and get to triple zero without another snap as you see there's a six and a half second difference in the game in the play clock as we hit fourth down post Martin Manley deep I've seen him take two back against Western Michigan in one game and it lets monotones guys know don't snap it let's not take timeout geez Oh Pizza what goodness I mean honestly how do people mess up clock situations at the end of the video it's their first listen they're all women don't snap that's a Phillip Rivers brother Stephens the backup quarterback those are because if they would have snapped LSU would have had to give the ball over on downs to Iowa and would have had it one play from midfield to win the game freshman quarterback I guess always blame the quarterback or the head coach but that was almost very costly so you gotta have Martin manly who I have seen take it back twice in one game he's one of the top punt returners in college football and we'll see if Iowa goes with the allout block eight seconds remaining and we'll send you to Pasadena for the pregame and on the pageantry spectacular day at the Rose Bowl Stanford a Michigan State getting sent to square off in the 100th Rose Bowl game confusing with Iowa now Iowa doesn't have Martin Manley back deep they're running players off the field Iowa was confused there's a flag down for IO the perhaps too many men on the field meantime the ball on the bounce is picked up and flipped wildly across the field towards Anthony Hitchens and now they're trying to do the old Stanford towns deflected forward but Mars and tackled there again there are two flags down one I believe is on Iowa for number of players they had on the field I think the second one is for the ball going forward this game should be over good job you mentioned there at the end of it with you get Martin manly back or go for the allout block that it was confusing with Iowa's see Tanner Miller number five Loudermilk or confused illegal bat on the receiving team penalties declined the game is over her parents are saying wait a minute he wants to talk to the official because when they were running a player up they had 11 players on the field but that illegal batting penalty to happen back at the goal lines the players were trying to throw it back and forth brings the game to an end and LSU as one an interesting 2014 Outback Bowl 21 to 14 jeremyhill the big running star this game Lisa standing by with cook thank you my gosh you defended the fake punt you stop them fourth and one late in the game describe the effort of your people defense played spectacular and really we put them on the field on the field on the field the one drive in the second half offensively contributed but boy that defense was start to finish dominant you know what Jeremy Hill did but all before the game we were talking about your true freshman quarterback how do you think it is I think he did for a first start there we go well done managed it to a point did some things that will not have him do but it's a nice start and we'll see where we go from here thank you congratulations and happy new happy LSU with questions who will be the quarterback of the future Jennings wins today our final score LSU 21 Iowa 14 with John Bruton Lisa Salters Mike Tirico now the BCS pregame show get you set for the Rose Bowl to Pasadena and here's Chris Fowler
